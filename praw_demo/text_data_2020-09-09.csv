0,2020-09-09," say say Feel bad Fauci, deserves better Would great see many asymptomatic  I’m 32. I’m high risk, 33 year old husband.

Who going teach kids? Young people high risk too. going drive busses? going run cafeteria? Hell, kid young school, kids high risk parents siblings?

Online school isn’t perfect, choice worsening educational inequality year lots dead bodies, one lot easier deal with. terrified pandemic turning era. I'm praying knees best case scenario ever is. Unfortunately people make charts really tend put Vietnam them, would believe it. Vietnam excellent job pandemic prevention. one stopping you, vaccines rest us. Big give us Election Day Man. Seems everytime check corona sub someone attacking validity it. Strange days. Fuck GOP showed door positive Covid test said DTF, I’d go it. India control covid. country's health ministry reported staggering 90,802 new cases Monday! I’m different stage life. want son able go school full time, go office (maybe everyday), 2-3 kickass vacations year. 

I’ve done nothing year. cumulative cases. week Aug. 31 - Sept. 4. Since Aug. 10 UGA total 2,588 Positive COVID-19 tests. would know though unless add numbers UGA report total cumulative cases website. UGA data updated daily. updated weekly. offer several graphs displaying basic data. biggest issue data collected. UGA reports 4 different types COVID Positive Data. ""Other"", ""UGA Surveillance"", ""UHC"", ""Athens &amp; Local Community"". 

""UGA Surveillance"" offers 450 tests day program. program available asymptomatic. volunteer basis UGA requiring anyone get tested. week positivity rate group 8.03%, 5.30% previous week. 
 
UHC University Health Center UGA. symptomatic report UGA asking get tested UHC. required offer testing here. 

""Other"" ""Athens &amp; Local Community"" tests report ""DawgCheck"". DawgCheck UGA Self-Reporting Portal. Every member UGA community receives email daily asking person answer series questions determine person may COVID-19 positive. also supposed report positive case here. also required. reported students actually using resource look data becomes questionable.

In UGA Surveillance data past week 8.03% positivity rate 125 positive cases. Subtracting tests UHC (405) UGA Surveillance (125), self reported cases total 887. population UGA around 50,000 subtract people tested UGA Surveillance (1,557) brings population 48,443 (Obviously missing UHC total tests, UGA report data). would bring positivity rate 1.8%. know isnt perfect way math, send alarm bells something wrong way UGA gathering data. Maybe UGA students campus.

The University System Georgia feels different though. numbers published today released [UGA USG, ""UGA’s recent increase positive COVID-19 tests largely among students, appears direct result off-campus activities, large institutions. campus, preventive measures social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands keeping surfaces disinfected working."" shall pass. humanity could survive 14th century we’ll survive 2020. pray, like hypocrites, love pray standing synagogues street corners seen others. Truly tell you, received reward full

Matthew 6:5 really think average person reads whole article title? time Reddit says no. That’s purely political comment. I’ll leave mods decide even posted.

Even US leadership page strategies implemented, American people simply pay heed it. solution ride there’s vaccine reason money. People won’t pay tens thousands dollars glorified YouTube videos.

If still college, I’d taking year see could find work. take general classes community college transfer satisfy elective requirements get way. Emergency use authorization incoming - probably couple days election. Human always come money. end day, money fake numbers. There's senior DHS whistleblower. edited Russian ops reports meant help law enforcement protect it. staying safe Covid, see perks wearing masks could improve life.

First all, acne isn’t full display everyone outside see 24/7. I’ve acne since kid masks thing, hide situations like job interview I’m trying make good impression someone. 

They also probably make little easier walk outside Winter. remember always put head going walks December cold temperatures would hurt face. 

Do want permanent Covid contained? No, healthcare professionals might don’t think Americans do. 

I could see people adopting masks certain situations, go work/school sick, extra protection flu season immunocompromised pre-existing condition, don’t think would need worn 24/7 everyone Covid contained.  Oh, alright I'll settle whatever economic conditions throw go concerts get laid. It'll feel like fucking Roaring 20's regardless else happening. UK made vaccine nothing hot truth. folks expected vaccine year's end maybe little optimistic warranted  Huh, family cat almost died kidney failure earlier year, right dad came back overseas miserable flu... interesting point also believe weeks proper rigorous operations could put virus control quite effectively. pretty locked down, much could left house time. went outside. can’t fathom least walking around outside bit day. server's wage relies completely unregulated source, means racism, sexism form discrimination can't dealt with. also creates kind vigilante culture: say ""we tip based well server did"", except that's really it. People argue they're blue face MUST tip 20%, raise hell. ""optional not"". restaurant could bake price make mandatory, won't: want money shitty tippers too.

Ban tipping, pay servers living wage, adjust prices accordingly get rid discriminatory practices benefit employers. Wow. Interesting walked back cause. Thanks posting. Good times definitely return within couple years. I’m thinking upswing gradual starting next summer. I’ll completely roaring 20s though. Cuz protects things like seasonal common flu. like said, wearing masks bother slightest whatsoever. inconvenience ruin day take freedom away. He's hero sure. also crazy workouts 80 year old.

Mostly scared Covid would kill I'd never see again. Also needed financial help. Also I'm glad did. old roommates partying living like Covid exist. Fucking idiots. Sure, infection prevention? I'm really sure that's case. average person feel need comment, suspect. people make incorrect assumptions comment accordingly necessarily representative anything vocal minority.  make comments saying government needs take money. buy calls AZ tomorrow? one? Bezos Trump hate  believe it’s best get tested day 8 exposure. Day 5 average symptoms begin symptoms show up. says, ""The secondary attack rate COVID-19 among household contacts 10.3% study, consistent secondary attack rates 11.2% cities China (20) 10.5% United States (21)"" presymptomatic spread accounts 11% cases. Youre spreading misinformation. doesn’t matter won’t work point. way CrossFit, walked sidewalk took one step black top, feet went air came back head. hurt week Yeah, I've built 6 month emergency fund (that like half pre Covid). I'm track double March. taught frugality I'm going hold to. feel bad supporting local businesses, gotta look livelihood first. Never know income could stop. you’re smart can’t believe smart are. Well, US, government stands way putting system like place. I'm guessing similar problem elsewhere. think would great idea, costly, many people would rather see death governmental spending. sounds harrowing, especially guy crippling secondary infection lung bubbles. others debilitated neurological problems  That’s said. Nice try though. Irrelevant point disagreement pertains comment asymptomatic spread. Differentiation issue here. Lets muddy. issue statement specific situation misrepresented statement asymptomatic spread generally. clarification essentially WHO's position misrepresented suggesting asymptomatic spread rare generally, part comment I'm concerned with. stated? HK, Macao Taiwan Asia (ex-China)? work religiously, gym last day closed, first day opened again, last day re-closed, first day re-reopened. However, go late possible, hour close 5-10 people building (and generally 5-10 again, opposed random gathering).

But even would definitely caught dead cardio equipment right now. That's bridge far me. That's way much panting, even masks, feel like stay far enough away anybody, especially rows machines somebody behind me. also stationary whole time, event end getting exposed virus someone working near you, sitting heavily breathing like 20, 30, 60 minutes straight. sure SHIT ""peak"" hours, even 25% capacity rule place city. saves lives really care lot people worried Trump would push regardless regulations try get vaccine election. caution makes people feel comfortable vaccine testing taken seriously. say I’d going places I’d risk infecting people? Why? actually think so. get shit together mid next year, think could see economic boom. many struggling rn, there's also lot people still working saving money going traveling. Thanks. mean offend, personally seen anything like area, like said, Ulster super busy since June. None local restaurants linked cases media. 1000% agree. haven’t gym since started (my early March busy sick). I’ve put good bit weight. I’m black white without strict gym routine can’t keep discipline need. it’s worth now. got shape Covid, it’s safe. I’m not. original comment clearly differentiates asymptomatic presymptomatic. rule applied every single state. Well converse happening anytime soon, that's sure. Ugh please reply comments ""people deserve live making life comfortable fun"" energy this. Very. guess supposed expert commenting now... FSU, Florida. Religious dumbfucks worst dumbfucks Clarified/retracted. Point implication misrepresenting said way caused need clarification. Certain among people dumb tricked devil long time ago realize it. actual fact person Transverse Myelitis? Ive read another post guys India halting study say person kind history happen. say patient another kind problem. really know lie fact .. not. knew dangerous is, try save people politics. He's fucking evil. ok this? morality? wrong you? Right?? district proactive spring. shut cases discovered locally. care??? Like, geez...  NYC 25,000+ restaurants vs maybe dozen count Saratoga. Even filled capacity, hell lot people passing restaurants NYC. read article all. read title didn’t you?  going get sooner later, what’s point hiding home. Might well get Covid peace mind you’re immune. kind. kind thoughtful people world also know much masks fart does. molecules fart gases less 0.5% size coronavirus particle genius. didn’t retract it, clarified difference asymptomatic presymptomatic. ""tolerate"", could fight it. no: good chunk country fights keep way. That's way harder fighting status quo. way harder ""the people vs 1%"". people people (even people heavily influenced 1%) got covid person makeup don’t go gyms buy snake oil instead. think prominent economist expects GDP even worse next quarter. OK.

Again, deprive young people education virus kills old people?

An education ""essential."" “men”tal health supposed mean? Bruh  Hm. Oh know....maybe multiple number deaths compared 9/11. decline world standing eyes everyone else opportunities enemies geopolitically? Oh yeah, throw recession too. point that's beginning think of. seems refuse go details guess I'll respond kind. Since White House even know South Dakota is? ask Trump he'll place us somewhere around South Carolina even though he's six hours one time.

Pennington County second population Clay County 19th population 66 counties. 

Clay County University South Dakota - Vermillion

Pennington County Ellsworth Air Force Base along South Dakota School Mines &amp; Technology, National American University, Western Dakota Technical Institute, USD School Nursing, SDSU College Nursing Rapid City.

Beadle County - 4th population - South Dakota State University - Huron popping ""hot"" spot soon, Lawrence County - 9th population - Black Hills State University - Spearfish Brown County - 3rd population - Northern State University - Aberdeen. Yeah, hoping we'd able come bit farther respect now. :( Proving US officials knew President continued minimize even 4 months that.  It'd lot easier piece junk organization masters used first 6 months ""stay home"" things needed do. winter ""not going easy"" organization federal government large _failed_ response virus.

Sit quiet, old man... already failed. China's century, we're living it.

They defeated coronavirus west cowering praying vaccine. we're right back innate selfishness person places privacy someone else's life. one even say that? Lol there's reason downvoted hell back. almost like wrong everything. Bye. It’s hard stay afloat. I’d look another job 4 year old work specific hours. Ok, ty cause first thought.
Thinking, I'm 43 leave me.. Germany never really mass death event like France, Spain Italy. # Lifegoals say preprint. lol bother? shit show here, assume got it. thing is, really need hard lockdowns. would even counterproductive point.

Just everyone wear masks, shut greatly limit certain activities known spreading events.

That's it. get rid completely, least go normalcy certain activities limited. might months new relief bill passed. would make getting COVID crime, punishable forcible privacy violations. End result, smart people get tested government find violate privacy. Moloch demands sacrifice reason gas station clerks don’t seem disproportionate infected. think time something it. squares, guess pays one pandemic /s Dude, fucked. Trump end presidency like hotel guest knows he’s get kicked room, takes huge shit middle bed go. people need stop eating. Starvation definitely less dangerous COVID19.

Because two options world restaurants starve? Ever heard cooking? Well, one major factor top head typically, point body rejects new organs foreign material. imagine happens next.  public people, especially indoors, increases risk?


Who knew????


There actually people paid figure common sense. live Florida that’s true I’d encourage reach local church, even aren’t religious. I’m sure would nearby family would “adopt” movie nights, game nights, holidays. youth pastor would likely know guys 20s 30s gamers, D&amp;D groups, play disc golf, whatever leisure activity appeals you. don’t understand asked 9/11. want perspective 9/11 begin with? don’t understand relates Covid, infants, masks EA's ""pride accomplishment"" comment: joke you? real? Every major power manipulates media. China happens more, larger outsized resource it. Even closures I've seen number drinks food served glasses plates clean. 

I can't imagine workers see daily basis. least drink dispensers fast food restaurants shutdown manned staff. We’ve gone flattening curve needing “complete safety”. need complete safety welcome rest life. 

Anything approaching normalcy course increases odds contracting Covid infection. idea therefore avoid normalcy “completely safe” frighteningly acceptable now. Rip, lived good life dude Also slightly heavier person trying lose weight, directly addresses contradicts ""healthy size"" movement, rightfully so. 

It sad many dying COVID, especially due inept leadership, majority articles younger people dying we've seen patient obese. (or really before) taking measures address obesity epidemic country putting stop ""healthy every size"" movement, way healthy. stupid, insecure youth fall let stay risk. shitty tell someone sadness trivial. Everyone suffering two things pain focused mean going through. Expect compassion willing give crybabies ever seen anyone bad case COVID-19? close friend relative die it? Go ahead mix up. Keep “men”tal health. people live sometimes damaged internally- Lungs, kidneys, heart, even brain damage, would predict since you’re weak area. Grow up! Lots countries opened schools number covid cases fine. really, like said before, first want understand perspective. forget that? Maybe reasons 9/11 bad match mine. there's nothing argue there? Learning two way street. Unless reason converse people wave beliefs face walk away digging heels changing beliefs whatsoever. sound like progress you? Masks banned hospitals.  Good I'm guessing result summer vacations Europe? (Australia) sent bunch fire fighters California. I’m sure bit urgent industry movements. threatened close school continued show school. wouldn’t close 45 year old man would kid?  odds 40 dying catch Covid living normally months.

Roughy 150 every 100,000 people 40 die every year 80 100,000 catch covid 40 die (only 2 100,000 children). LOL, good luck then. Cops absolutely allowed search homes people significant evidence committing criminal act via search warrent. emergent case (believe serious criminal act committed murder), police need wait warrent. 

Once person tested positive covid 19, considered par compelling definitive evidence needed gotten warrent. want get judge involved ""approve"" positive test case sufficient evidence privacy lower priority literal health safety people they've come contact in, means involve judge formality's sake. massive surge infections wake this. battery point-at-forehead

Point underside people's wrists. lot reliable they've sun while. hosts party positive, guests. Don’t minimize people lost year, everyone lost something everyone struggling. Go mad Jeff bezos something, shaming someone change wedding really petty. I’m third worlder case wondering. Smartly solving debt crisis. Yes big American landmarks like Pulse nightclub. Well mean many people fly directly White House anyway? Wait, find I've ever virus donating blood? quite rare healthy young people die - people aware whether risk factors - *you* like wearing mask mean everyone else Proudfeet! IFR miniscule new cases 20-30 year olds. densely populated India? I'm sure major cities India much larger. guess. Germany well moment compared European countries? started screenings found first place better yet block international travel. often not, person 1 scenario also works salaried job remotely suburban home office fenced-in back yard. It’s easier say “Stay fuck home!” that. probably are, someone posted article days ago talked mentioned probably reached degree herd immunity reached around 30% infection rates deaths suddenly started go down. probably 60k + cases day France testing limited sickest tested. “catching” positives it’s much easier get test. I’m betting knew actual number positives vs would lower. Hospitalization death rates much better variables monitor see COVID controlled. ask that's typically case? seem across board depend upon particular illness? We've got best cases sucks bad I’m really sorry:( good postponing though careful responsible!! hope still everything guys dreamed would classes go well! Watch comment get removed calling pieces shit empathy too. I’m sick censoring subreddit. 

Do it, mods. Im little confused comment. looking things argue about? Sooo... stop taking shoes belts? means passengers infectious spread showed symptoms. that's true means IFR miniscule. Given sub 20 deaths per day almost 9k confirmed cases per day. That's around .22% CFR even lower IFR. time it’s approved mass distribution there, another several months it’s available here. 

If someone going make formula stateside, get rigorous QC European manufacturers give drugs, would regulators give shit either way?

I don’t think I’d take domestic made vaccine unless added national vaccine injury compensation plan. We're going wear masks forever shut countries every year flu hits. made tear up. seems like endless tunnel. imaging able get vaccine... mean jobs provide form health insurance pay much..

Banishing Blue Jays play baseball Buffalo bad ass move. third choice - mask mandates federal government - strict social distancing protocols (including public transport protocols) - closed schools total distance learning - intensive test trace (this sans mandate part, since citizens asked wear mask, Japan did). couldn’t either choice two choices listed, would required lot support federal government big business people already fine workers replaceable cogs corporate machines. surprised. super rural trump country there.

Teacher pay based yearly salary. districts offer choice either take larger paychecks duration school year pay anything summer, give smaller paychecks extend summertime.

For some, first option better sustainable income, others, prefer stability summer.

It ""subtraction"" much ""division"" pay periods. mean, it’s surprising considering countries requiring negative Covid test hand within certain timeframe flight.

The USA like person teacher-assigned group grade school sits group members work. wrong, covid evolve another strain rendering initial one useless point another.

So...what justification administration providing, says good time stop? still pandemic?  Hilarious reddit wants Trump people direct lives. MYami, OURami - remember that. Huh? bill never really supposed pass, though. GOP knows they're going get crushed November, point game plan sabotage recovery Democrats take control White House possibly Senate. There's simply explanation dragging feet large second round stimulus spending broad support economists sides ideological divide, even top Trump people like Mnuchin. want inflict economic pain Americans think help claw back power 2022 2024. hope real help Biden wins presidency, Democrats take Senate, kill filibuster push *actual* stimulus bill. Sorry, English first language. Let try again.

A normal vaccine takes 10 15 years make.

We rushing one... probably still take 2 3 years.

Then produced. 

Then distributed (and/or forced anti vaxers).

Even best case scenario kids school 3+ years. 

The damage total mortality politically charged things response virus staggering. 

When Trump office.... (hopefully sooner later), everyone pretend saying ""new knowledge""... somehow known.

Don't person kind care tbh. Sometimes hurts seeing brainwash. relatives Sweden. hurts.

 course herd immunity strategy. all, Tegnell says so, better believe him! Europe also vastly different infection rates Regions countries.

The whole premise ""EUROPE"" thread work. calling ""replica"" drastic overstatement. pen shaped like musket. replica least resemble actual weapon size. reason allow pen flight. I’m 30. chances COVID still kicking around I’m 50? understand pandemic end within year two vaccines coming out, mean COVID eradicated? expect non-pandemic-level outbreaks decades come? epidemiologists studied WOW corrupted blood incident, infected people deliberately exposing others believed something ever happen real world. wrong. Yes, does. absolutely unreasonable expectation. far responsibility, whole issue us taking responsibility wanting pass buck. like blaming tribe Africa HIV saying there's nothing do. vaccine probably work high risk category (the elderly). problem vaccines. work best young &amp; healthy group trigger necessary immune response. way protect venerable give 80%+ population vaccine &amp; elderly get protected herd  No? would I? read? read literate. Glad finding safe way play. Covid 29 gonna us while. mutation? china strain infectious Italy strain. know early west coast cases china strain NY Italy Presidents change. Hopefully November fact.

Everyone still get flu vaccine, right? know, super interesting. Really points darn contagious is! lets skip TSA lines 5 years — cost early boarding one two flights. worth it.

They’re using justification bring us back too. Maybe become nationwide No.1 something. cause death that's avoidable, absolutely. impact sudden increase death, especially impacts parts society service others like doctors, nurses, teachers requires significant time, effort, expertise reach serviceable position much severe. Society developed measures compensate consistent loss life experience every day, ways manage grief suffering result. deaths outpace measures, especially specific positions society depends on, would argue already strained medical teaching positions are, good, noteworthy. Looks like press release me. Never mind. Rapid test that's painful / inconvenient exactly what's needed. going live C19 time Good damn, crazy people build Much TSA *security theater*. Bruce Schneier security expert bases advice evidence critical putting security theater actual (often hidden unglamorous) improvements security. Terrorism always rare, we’ve heard 9/11 changing world, it’s still rare. Even 9/11 failed kill many people automobiles US every single month. there’s pervasive myth terrorism easy. It’s easy imagine terrorist plots, large-scale “poison food supply” small-scale “10 guys guns cars.” Movies television bolster myth, many people surprised attacks Western cities since 9/11. Certainly intelligence investigation successes made harder, mostly it’s terrorist attacks actually hard. It’s hard find willing recruits, co-ordinate plans, execute plans — it’s easy make mistakes.

Source: majority people vaccine needed. Even though novel Virus 80% cases mild symptoms best. Tons studies Show . simply dont need it. Even though numbers people positive PCRTest increased (not speaks disease Sarscov 2) numbers people dying Sarscov stayed tue same. correct. obese person's life less worth you? wondering. need travel guy. There’s whole world full terrible places there.

This death used push agenda. teacher, didn’t get virus kids, biggest risk death Covid besides age. It’s sadly non-story. Good call, think US everyone’s ‘do visit’ list now. Probably even countries we’ve never heard before. Show evidence shut Another stellar move world's stable genius, folks! Hope wills updated! spend time investigating China put new headline tries* make us look better. spent time investing we’d find much That's fantastic. hope see here. Although worry. Anecdotally I'm seeing less people practice social distancing, mask wearing. Come give I’m afraid dying it. It’s unending list possibly lifelong crippling damage done literally part organs. Maybe right given are..but theres way meets NICE value money. Maybe experience random number generator excel sucks random all. didn’t see article, screening, actually testing time? Holy crap comments awful Plus pandemic assume symptoms covid.

This getting spread around everybody says ""don't worry grandma, cold.""

Next week ""how grandma die covid?!?!"" read correctly, schools opened classes 9 12th students. Also, mostly need basis students access online classes trouble understanding online classes. Also, going schools parents needs provide written permission.
I know, government taken wrong decisions respect handling Covid situation proper planning lockdown unlocking. But, mean criticise every decision taken government. Putin poisoners notwithstanding. can't pull now, Technology Review review 5 different countries excellent responses virus, airport screening big one poor countries. authors paper certainly know correlation equal causation. said, pre-print 🤷‍♀️  Yep, witness it, every time. Reddit turned mini China can't criticize China without downvoted argued till lose live mean, not? Win-win. Warn sizable audience (that appreciates no-nonsense persona) dangers covid selling covid-friendly exercise solution. mean, doesn’t want tighter buns *at home*? seems high numbers going down. soon fall season comes around, think see acceleration deaths. never testing arrivals, temperature checks. Surely prefer fix problem rather stop trying entirely? 0.5mg vitamin D3 LOT, take commercial daily Vitamin, 30 tablets. lol Well base arguments 2 things.

1. Public Health Agency dont care economy, responsibility.
2. choose expensive methods fight virus instead locking people up.


What youre arguments? Maybe dont clear sign dont actually understand believe something, words victim propaganda. need import world's leading exporter. positive % horrible metric use anything data. still almost entirely older people. study looked young, non-pregnant US adults already admitted. made 5% admitted hospitals COVID. based know, sample's size probably tiny compared number young adults got COVID need admitted. 

the argument ""COVID high chance making young people really sick,"" true. additionally, people absolutely free endanger - allowed drink alcohol damage liver. 

the issue going seeing people means putting others risk. additionally, there's way people guarantee exposing young people. going restaurant means exposing essential workers much choice whether stop working. going grocery store meaning leaving virus food people pick up. going get tested symptoms means exposing healthcare workers. way, going living life calculated risk-benefit analysis impacts oneself - like driving drunk pretending one else road. thank you! wish &lt;3 insinuating Ms. Jones outright lying? Telling baseless lie seems like good way ruin future career prospects.

I'm taking stance either way. want believe Florida manipulating data also think data scientist fired state credible first hand witness..  benefit could normality - care much costs honest. know, he'll probably Trump that's sure. I’m also curious this

Sweden functioning completely normally right nobody dying anymore. Surprised isn’t talked They’ll find 2nd shoe bomb one day... shoe bomb may actually faulty!! China people thin, men overwhelmingly smoke more. men died much higher rates.

When Micheal Olsterholm Joe Rogan, predicted exactly saying. Obese people smokers die much higher levels. zero surprise. 

Any legislation government initiative addressing obesity gets shot communism right fat shaming overweight. Americans want full freedom complain consequences rear ugly heads. want find amusing many people would believe you. government help? major corporations rich got tons help. rest us $1200 go die. Social distancing, use masks, hand washing interaction public areas, etc. also limit spread influenza. think model takes account expects influenza spread historically. see masks use precautions sars-cov2 specific. well put.

Modern solutions black white. They're managing complexity. 

Many people seem take approach making decision right thing do, justifying decision want correct. worse useless. actively destructive society.

The wiser approach define desired outcome broadest positive terms, work backwards figure get there. 

The hardest part done expectation things go wrong. one anticipate every consequence. world complex perfect plan. So, plan ahead tell quickly possible things working revise plan.

This apparently anathema certain groups people. idea might try things learn improve go threat comfort level sees change dangerous personally.

That phenomenon name: insecurity. could moved back parents grad classes online. Lol Couldnt replied better DAE Xinnie Pooh?!?!

Seriously though, looking US response covid compared China...I would rather China right now. seemed unrelated according article. odd though, July talk MS drug could potentially treat Covid 19. I'd imagine/hope they're keeping close eye possible connection. mother 72 sick past week fever flu like symptoms. Fearing worst went doctor. negative COVID, positive double ear infection. let million fellow citizens get locked without issue, would upset one doctor, coerced government stop trying save lives, simply medal slapped dead body changes system? kids started August 13th. school school virtual learning. 2 weeks first day got email saying student Covid. Deathsentence? wear masks ate together, probably hugged other. People subreddit need understand pro-mask, social distance, take seriously time acknowledging reports studies show virus lot less deadly spreads much less efficiently thought.

Also, stop promoting individual stories accepted norm country? Yes, incredibly sad young single mother three, teacher, football player died disease, even young, otherwise healthy, obese people 94-96% survival infected. stop fearmongering acknowledge zero-sum game continuing wear masks practice social distancing, making healthy. Oh good. Mask troops deployed cities squash citizens forgot common side effect 5G (apart rona one) - turning white children gay USA == bad know health minister? Americans going get right we're fucking imbeciles. matter many articles like written, idiots responsible exacerbating spread change give shit. Articles like laughed degenerates serve giant circle jerks echo chamber give bit consolation intelligent part population mercy asswipes. family watching fucking tucker last night gall pull video fauci saying virus issue Americans....... fucking January. go say ""this quote context""... asshole sleep night knowing everything cancerous misleading? Now? let thousands die earlier.

Other countries near deaths. go get s/moronavirus Yeah likely press release copied pasted game since beginning. believe already trials sort cancer. used small amount patients back April (6 patients think) compassionate use Israel went well. 

The biggest thing like orally administered. ends efficacy good everyone. Especially since looks like Oxford vaccine might delayed bit. reading strength right. 

Do try insult people like general conversation real life? anonymous online? strange.

How old you? can't believe actual adult would behave like this. ever read back comments wonder are? forget talking actual human beings? 54,6% would fucking imagined..... diagnostic labs using single PCR test like article describes batch testing common? correct. Let downvoters downvote, agree you. 

If ill, avoid people, average healthy people worry. 

I work operational hotel, meet hundreds people daily. Because, already said fuck it. really, fuck it. really *ironic* surely believe ""the ongoing genocide Uigurs"", never questioning sources information.

The day start looking *where* information comes from, start looking founding, possible biases, robustness methodologies support claims, might *very* surprised.

You need believe anything CCP says face value see something clearly Western reports. Maybe even start understand propaganda about. Maybe. Unless healthcare professional available mass public election day anyway. AstraZeneca's ""integrity"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

These pharmaceutical companies integrity, can't serious. Everything cold calculation maximize profits. procurement process isn’t clear, allows lot people getting rich crisis.

Watch majority billions get given newly formed companies owned Cummings' friends. absolutely floored CDCs behavior year. literally became lapdog Trump. virus takes normal people turns republicans true enough, planning getting flu shot anyway.... many papers Italy indicating degree severity decreasing... Okay. understand, resign mean would able move somewhere better cheaper similar rates? I'm expert, dont think area yet. I'm still going play safe meaningful though since lot people 65 above. sad cold hard truth. anti-rona people give shit long continue fun bringing income. one tell moms x-ray vision Nooooo.... Youve fallen infinite star loop. saving now. flu vaccine..... Covid-19 vaccine ""The study linked attended traveled back home states, compared changes coronavirus trends rally's conclusion.""

Just assuming local increases rally bad job local governments done seem dodgy. credit rally lower spread correlated. see bother peer review. Insurance companies cover anything deductible limit. high deductible plan holy shit.. aight, thats enough reddit today lol

if cant make difference calling people bad words made joke political opinion disagree describing behavior retarded... yes first case implied said stupid shitty person made bad jokes (which tbh dont see whats bad joke, believe someone made jokes worded differently they're like top comments?) political opinions think im free dont see allows judge worth individual.

&amp;#x200B;

and second case called retarded behavior people. dont see whats youre getting offended about, right think one particular set actions seems retarded (i explained why, people didnt explain stupid shitty joke bad said so). yeah people really take things easily. maybe youre reading sub often end thinking everyone asshole doesnt care others especially time spent without going out. well imao thats reason insult random strangers internet. got mine morning. even helps little, worth it. meant numbers percentages difference. poster change title article?  Hmm, maybe article says it’s totally possible patient condition, final diagnosis pending.  Veryyyyyyyy fucking different. know resemblance American beer making love canoe? fucking close water. Answer question: teachers demand? want floor-to-ceiling plexiglass class rooms? HEPA air cleaners every ten feet? exactly would ask strike?

What millions first responders (fire, EMT, etc.) interact potentially coronavirus-infected people every day? hundreds thousands healthcare workers across US enough PPE told ""just re-use one mask have!"" working patients known infected coronavirus? jobs miiiight tiny bit dangerous teaching children isn’t dangerous job US moment.

The fact thought typing sentence right thing means live sheltered life, clue world operates, both.

You probably drop smug talking points. Wanted highlight story apparently mods locking deleting posts related want ""certain discussion"" Costs far much benefit.  think choices? 

Germany non still 10000 death, population roughly 1/5 US. 
But closer Sweden wuhan terms lockdown. 
We could always go shopping walk reason, avoided going work possible, mask wearing keeping distance.
But heavy testing since February. I'm currently working RN trying make sure major league sports year, gotta say, think safely business side continues plays along allow medical professionals need do. team coronavirus coordinator fairly responsive, accommodating, dedicated running tight clean show. We've scares we've butted heads nonmedical side times starting come around.

There 18hr days boogieman rears face sets production shit storm, numbers remain incredibly low compared general public bringing lot people lot happiness income really shitty time. lived China, crackdown total. numbers add up. 1000 2000 cases Guangdong (edit 3... Guangdong, Pearl River delta (about size Delaware) 70 90 million people) completely shut three months? Temperature checks even leave building month half? Yeah, numbers bullshit.

That said, response China US, everyone must die stock market, completely day night.

Edit: Yep. Going get slammed redit reading comprehension deficiency crowd. Oh well. Seems direct upvoted reply literally said said far time scale, without adding details. Come reddit.

Edit 3. Part two. part fucking idiot brigade downvoted start (not likely fucking idiots never revisit idiocy), tske time reevaluate.

If upvoting now, take 5 minutes research situation. would say, take hour, research. click after. prioritise research? INSANITY!!!! That's provides many jobs politician speak them. basically welfare (and I'm saying insult TSA agents, lovely people...the job pretty meaningless, given success/failure rate). government pays tens thousands people stand airports make look like control whatsoever terrorist attacks (while getting disproportionately sick COVID, unfortunately). vaccine 80%of people needed. High prob  want get vaccine approved political reasons skipping FDAs normal process determining whether safe effective? Thanks! immune response one strain effect immunity another strain (that interpreted first comment).

People still moving around world strains place, dont think? Sweden. botched nursing home situation April May, buy fixed issue since done well, without ever locked down. exponential curve. Daily deaths near zero. last month (I’m Canadian, it’s allowed) saw eyes things there. talked bunch locals. learned one way deal virus. China invented toilet paper feel free use clam shells on. seriously comparing absolute numbers one state another 44 times population? let’s get started population density. 

Adjust per 100,000 SD Petri dish compared California based recent infections. Still cannot quite wrap head around Big Brains equate health orders issued *temporary* basis, order tamper potential economic healthcare system fallout brought global pandemic, affront freedoms. Seriously, stupid be? work ordered expensive battery point-at-forehead thermometers businesses. Got medical supplier. three locations, total cost 2 grand.

Sometime's reads people's temp 88.9 sometimes 91. throughout day, weather people coming outside different part building, weather employee feeling ill feeling great.

The point taking someone's temperature, unless actually feel 'hot touch' useless. maybe effective cheaper way tsa 'feel forehead' old fashioned mommy way? /s China responsible beeing permissive shitty cultures cause viruses bacterias spread. Almost pandemics humans history started there. must pay bill. wife works school they're screwed up. small town too. software want use remote teaching installed.  enough computers pads staff needs use software installed, there's cleaning/disinfecting protocol half staff teachers wear mask correctly there's chance kids will. make passed Halloween bet close early rest year Thanksgiving. dont know mean, bunch deaths piled behind us. mostly younger get infected. ICU death counts stable couple weeks, looks similar DE/DK/NO example. go wedding last week. girlfriend said shame get wear nice suit purchased said I'll wear funerals happen this.  people mask. go inside get food turned stay inside BS. Also masks used go inside either. NY state. checking temp 2x daily wearing N95 around everyone else since. nope sorry outside family visits 2 weeks. scientist going say masks work without evidence back up. 

No scientist would say *don't* work needed without evidence back up. fair? Cause that's happened. guess people understand ""neurological problems"" meant something brain, news? Public schools provided government provides BMVs VA hospitals. Classic examples overly bureaucratic mediocrity. anyone surprised public schools mismanaged crisis mismanaged rest time? It’s getting funding starts butts chairs. government doesn’t want citizens educated. wants mollified. Really? Nothing?! I’m New York hit hard. We’re getting outbreaks recently. Numbers going up

Edit- numbers going 1. dumb parent allowed house party bunch high schoolers another dumb parent KNEW son Covid allowed go.., 25 cases 1 high school. 

Then sports starting back up, kids quarantined mostly since March, people wonder kids suddenly getting it. 

Hospitals seeing numbers rise. preparing. 

I hope family safe healthy. Healthy young people virtually risk bad outcome. Hard control indefinite time period nothing risk. one reasons DARE got big back day- schools got lump sum funding ‘drug education programmes’ even though common knowledge early 2000s DARE ineffective best, pretty easy use money new computer, coffee machine staff room, etc coworker taking kids JeffCo St Charles youth sports railing STLco restrictions. guess that's St. Charles passed STL city cumulative number cases. wearing masks too... Except already caused change police departments. even yet, proposal? nothing accept abusive status quo? you’re alright it, go it! I’m relaying based personal encounters.  anti Trump am, process resulted basically zero findings, like dozen total people flagged something. Waste time money. swear chinabots real one. China responsible well US citizens? praise China much. China powerful, powerful. Well got sick school started, I'm sure really relates school openings. Yah, went tonher school, probably gone get groceries shit too. I'm person schools yet, fear porn. ...I know guy wrote it. assure bomb ass drunk! comment get 20 upvotes merely hour? english bad hardly makes sense. That’s thinking saw headline, you’re supposed test board plane country prove you’re negative, country tests landed would defeat purpose. screening theater many people asymptomatic. friend tested positive said feels fatigued he’s otherwise fine. test fast enough would India. No, person I've met lost job said making money working unemployment. Makes wonder people can't pay things poorer people made bunch extra money sitting home spending less since travel work. Also America thought valuable amount profit someone could gain lives? actually chance US model predicting 410,000 deaths years end/3,000 day accurate? That’s seems shockingly high. country tried passing mask mandate ended getting death threats, pulled it. funny red zone too! counter self completed health check parent complete kids sending school. Yeah could get situation Timor Leste?  ...among young people *sick enough hospitalized*.

The death rate much lower 1 40 young people generally.

That said, given unknown future health risks fact young spread disease elderly, course think caution still order. think misleading comments, own, helpful. good point. probably also likely someone get covid US bring here. say would doomsday defensive reason? can’t understand parent would none anything since 2016 made sense anyway Ha, thanks clarifying! Sometimes think life would simpler everyone subscribed German straightforwardness, lol. days hard tell who's sarcastic (protip: ask, yes, need /s), who's US oblivious, know live US exposed much shitshow here! every country job don't.

Every country needs ban Americans coming territories period. waste resources tax money testing them. government care all. America. course pass blame learn point fingers.  ""Morris"" code? Good one. just:

It’s covid kills. We’ve known forever now. It’s accompanying pneumonia organ issues kill. exactly cdc reported continue cherry pick Politics aside, excess mortality going number makes way history books. US double. marches demanding it, issues seem captured attention. sad part much blame state governments re-opening, close shop - many among us - going riot streets continued lockdowns. small business owners seen dime relief since lockdown started. Without social safety nets, going support families themselves? 


For us remain employed, easy say re-opening obvious disaster waiting happen, financially hurt lockdowns, re-opening would spell almost certain personal disaster them. Even profit margins barely breaking even (or even still negative), losing much could mean difference business spent whole lives building taking small hit still existing end pandemic versus closing good midst it.

I put blame squarely federal government coordinating national response mandating states enforce lockdown. current policy letting states decide close open like trying put fire smothering part it. going reignite another place take blanket off. come sweden deaths? lot countries don’t? Oh wow! stimulus money district, we’re spending computers student use, hotspots families, various EdTech apps.

According research letter published Wednesday journal JAMA Internal Medicine, young adults experience substantial rates adverse outcomes. **An analysis 3,222 young adults 18 34-years-old hospitalized Covid-19 indicated that:**

21 percent required intensive care.
10 percent required mechanical ventilation.
2.7 percent died. Propaganda machine chugs along, desperately trying feed hungry population. ... ideally researchers know either. used single blinded studies researchers unknowingly tip they're giving placebo (or otherwise). Don’t forget Medicare all. healthcare tied job contributes wage slavery. means destroying businesses limiting freedom disease nearly 100% survival rate, certainly is. otherwise healthy, chances dying COVID basically 0. Even CDC reported 94% ""covid deaths"" average 2.6 causes death. 

I know Reddit one opinion allowed I'm fine side one. Tl:Dr

MOSCOW - Twenty-six scientists, working universities Italy, signed open letter questioning reliability data presented early-stage trial results Russian COVID-19 vaccine, named “Sputnik-V”.

Addressing editor Lancet, international peer-reviewed medical journal Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute published early-stage trial results, scientists said saw patterns data looked “highly unlikely”.

The letter, published personal blog page one signatories, said Phase I/II trial results data showed multiple participants reporting identical antibody levels. lightening strike Bravo Sweden showing world COVID controlled without crazy lockdown. resident [Redacted] identified event’s organizer.

From article


Also, Theres one way Puerto Rico, airport. Authorities arresting able identify videos. rumor matching cameras airport forms give entering island. Looks like trying make example them. I'm sure orange plague say want cause panic. concert outside? every story I've heard virus, feel like attendees may overlapping indoor venues like bars, restaurants, etc. Least trump actually something pandemic instead downplaying Yes, like thousands screaming protests. equally safe. Even kill 'em often might miss taste food weeks.....kinda depressing. Zoom also can't handle millions students using once. Add businesses also use it, half country seems trying use Zoom. servers utterly choking weight.

Skype WebEx really dropped ball. aggressively pursuing school districts like Zoom did. they're platforms stability. even mention getting infected different strains.

Did read it? establish two infections person separate events, Hong Kong Nevada teams sequenced1,2 viral genomes first second infections. **Both found enough differences convince separate variants virus work.** Darwin Award people stupid things reproduce. saying people go work something stupid? Much smart.. doubt that's anywhere near true given 1,669 deaths listed Ohio compared 2,797 (the actual number).

There something like 6,700 nursing home/LTC deaths New York according state data 4,087 according CDC data.

The actual number nursing home deaths far higher CDC data says.  There's also term limits Australian prime ministers. point?

Also, pretty sure Obama would handled pandemic better Trump. Yes, yes do. common, people get hospitals... sort Morris Code thing? dashes such? proper way w/ data. fucking wonder why. happy determined student back January. focused full dreams. struggle get bed feel like point living. constant anxiety recurring suicidal thoughts. this, never depressive episode, rely heavily medication, enough keep giving completely. kind life - masks, visiting friends family, nothing fun do, nothing look foward - expect future, want live anymore.

I probably going throw window point. one care death, one cares mental effects isolation. We're going start checking way - case catch coronavirus here, we'll sneeze them.

Kidding aside - countries doing? part culture? ""Reason.com""? Uh...seems like bullshit me. Study notwithstanding. used political tool

You would think actual medical professional would actively condemn mass gatherings kind pandemic eh? ""political tool"" would refuse answer obvious question topic directly asked. I’ve martial arts mask 2 months now. issues. fact resting heart rate improved. Thank selfish people 🙏 virus us years people like this. People keep wanting things go back precisely way before. economy “recover” still see sector fundamentally changed even ruined. economy continually sees things succeeding things failing; covid May force things fail position nothing “because it’s hard track.” Nobody talking smearing blood droplets others, either. think holding people accountable inadvertent transmission workable biosphere.

Also: many us, living half-life indefinitely damaging, soul level, learning live virus.

Believe not! UK, chief medical officer man called Chris Witty asked question almost daily live press conferences government would hold. answered question straight: might airborne, distinct possibility, there's evidence yet. said couple months one day said satisfied enough evidence say airborne. That's work. normal governments supposed work.  China also administered vaccinations people, claim. I’m sure value adds? mean like [THIS reason direct human studies mask efficacy SARS-CoV-2 transmission it’s new virus and, since potentially lethal, experiments masking, transmission disease severity necessarily limited animals. study doesn’t even deal SARS-CoV-2 influenza virus. study linked shows surgical masks fact **significant cut SARS-CoV-2 transmission hamsters**. study shows direct causation viral load disease severity, giving evidence masks’ usefulness self-protection least severe Covid case. 

And even though can’t direct human experimental studies doesn’t mean scientists can’t study mask efficacy community data mask use infection rates. 
Like [THIS [THIS [THIS 

And there’s scientific modeling done extrapolating previous data forecast many people could potentially saved dying permanently damaged Covid mask use part larger preventative system includes social distancing hygiene methods. Like [THIS [THIS it. want excuse can’t find direct human experiments cop-out choice hold biased narrative masks “useless.” that’s plain selfish ignorance.

That’s man Nursing home death 25% covid death nationally. Ohio really aiming top rank Even though FDA doesn’t see trial?

**FTFY** stop terrible gag reflex, yesterday mother drove 40 minutes get testing centre, throat swab nasal swab. much coward (but go quite deep, point tonsils) pretended gag reflex prevents even brushing teeth slightly deep. came back home test results arrived (negative) waiting mine, idea felt terrible finally admitted weak properly, understandably mad me. wondering, way stop gag reflex, way get blood drawn anything?

You qualified make statement. Furthermore comparing flu makes look even asinine. addition that, significant number teachers - least, I've run - also live elderly parents.

Like.... what???? Even worse, ran like Shark Tank first executive, Sanofi, said could candidate year, vaccine several years. Trump said, NEXT! next executive, Regeneron, promised something months. Suddenly Trump interested. Bancel Moderna got promised something within days weeks. Trump said give guys money. IHME predicts 400,000 dead end year.

Immune cells flood damaged sites, trying cleanse brain destroying infected cells.  coronavirus much stealthier: exploits brain cells’ machinery multiply, doesn’t destroy them. Instead, chokes oxygen adjacent cells, causing wither die.  researchers didn’t find evidence immune response remedy problem. “It’s kind silent infection,” Dr. Iwasaki said. “This virus lot evasion mechanisms.”  findings consistent observations organoids infected coronavirus, said Alysson Muotri, neuroscientist University California, San Diego, also studied Zika virus.  coronavirus seems rapidly decrease number synapses, connections neurons. “Days infection, already see dramatic reduction amount synapses,” Dr. Muotri said. “We don’t know yet reversible not.”  virus infects cell via protein surface called ACE2. protein appears throughout body especially lungs, explaining favored targets virus.  studies suggested, based proxy protein levels, brain little ACE2 likely spared.

It understood Astrazeneca, British drugmaker working Oxford, halted new enrolment trials British [volunteer showed transverse myelitis (TM), rare inflammatory condition affects spinal cord.

Stat, health industry website first reported hiatus, said woman suspected TM diagnosis confirmed, course discharged hospital early last night. 

Pascal Soriot, chief executive Astrazeneca, described measure “temporary pause” said independent committee experts would investigate.

A company spokesman added: “This routine action happen whenever potentially unexplained illness one trials . . . large clinical trials, illnesses happen chance must independently reviewed.”

The abrupt halt trials across UK, Brazil, South Africa United States jarring setback far race create coronavirus vaccine. However, scientists said pauses unusual.

TM caused viral infections, leading pain, muscle weakness numbness. Ian Jones, professor virology University Reading, said: “It’s inflammation nervous tissue caused number agents, one viruses. stoppage might symptoms plausibly linked vaccine, although could something else.”

Patients usually recover TM weeks condition linger months, added. often treatable steroids.

Stephen Evans, professor pharmacoepidemiology London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: “TM reported least seven different vaccines including polio MMR. It’s early say, fact case TM, caused vaccine. certainly possible TM coincidence.”

It second time trials Oxford vaccine, considered front-runner global race create jab, put hold. Enrolment halted July another suspected serious side-effect detected. Last night Astrazeneca confirmed July pause came participant diagnosed multiple sclerosis, unrelated vaccine.

Matt Hancock, health secretary, said latest pause would necessarily set project back.

“This normal part vaccine development that, find problem, system paused investigate particular problem,” told LBC radio. “What underlines won’t bring forward vaccine unless safe, matter enthusiastic vaccine.”

The Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, UK body approves vaccines use, said working Oxford team.

“We urgently reviewing information actively engaging researchers determine whether trial restart quickly possible,” Dr Siu Ping Lam, director licensing, said.

“Vaccine safety paramount importance continually monitor safety vaccines ensure benefits outweigh potential risks.”

Financial analysts said possible Oxford vaccine could lose ground [to two entered large trials US, American biotech giant Moderna Biontech, German company partnering US drugmaker Pfizer.

Analysts JP Morgan Cazenove, US stockbroker, said: “While true delay could increase Moderna’s Biontech’s odds winning so-called ‘race Covid-19 vaccine finish line’, think adds little fundamental value, vaccine’s ultimate clinical profile trump first-mover advantage still anticipate competitive market.”

Other scientists involved vaccine development said pauses expected late-stage trials. Robin Shattock, professor mucosal infection immunity Imperial College London, said: “I think pretty normal — it’s shown related vaccine restart couple days seen storm teacup. Even associated vaccine may allowed proceed caution.”

The results early phase trial, involved 1,000 British volunteers, reported several side-effects, including fatigue headaches, although considered fall within permissible limits. page, paragraph, quote, shut fuck forget studies show 45% folks get permanent heart lung damage die. famous last words Sure.... even comes side order krokodil Winnie Pooh

Jillian THIRSTY fame-dollars since LEAST 2001.

Water wet.

She well COVID19.

To clear, ""defending"" qhatever nonsense selling currently. I'm saying Jillian Selling Home Fitness Videos Times Even Inappropriate Times quite literally... *her thing*.

She used Biggest Loser. told one clients, immediately following client's spouse's death, double gym sessions rather attend wake. 

Jillian's MAIN game hocking home fitness, pre COVID, pre-appropriate-mourning loved one, pre-thinking-before-she-speaks-unless-its-about-a-fitness-video.

Being irritated Jillian shit like angry weed existing pandemic. knew needed COVID19, get it, slightly pissed price gone bit, still gonna talk shit buy anyways.

Be irritated Jillian tone deaf dumb shit used still doing. lot it. COVID19 dipshittery like.... lowly 2 scale 1 NuclearJillian Saying Dumb Shit. Thought Germany mindfuck United States? Yes. Around world? Definitely play fauci defending Trump loop whenever criticize anything Trump done. Us putting fauci pedestal allows merit. Teachers human education department knows it.I believe places advised teachers make wills...just case.Reopening schools stupid.How many GOP members kids going school.Trump's son . safe home , others pushed go back school experiment actually _stopped_. thousands thousands people who've vaccine thousands who've placebo, they're going lives, getting exposed virus time time catching it, returning regular test results track infected not. That's still going on, that's adding statistics hope soon say 'the vaccine highly effective'.

If I'm understanding right, stopped vaccination new volunteers, understand happened whether vaccine related. trial _stopped_, _getting bigger_ now. So.... country used highly elaborate schemes steal Olympic medals 5plus decades, trying pass fraudulent data regarding deadly disease?

Say ain't Cotton thought already knew this? disagree would also point nothing says dishonest. say need them, offer protection. says point time everyone wearing them, know impossible anyway enough masks everyone masks.

Masks proved limited protection explains this. People wear properly he's dishonest. also prevent virus entering body conjunctiva eye, dishonest. 

If actually listen saying explaining masks alone, whilst beneficial, may protect Corona virus. replacement social distancing used conjunction social distancing.  

This masks either work work scenario. offer increased protection time short supply essential allocated healthcare emergency workers. 

If didnt explain way public may well believe safe *because* mask on, fact safe reasons. mean saying masks help. best like 0.2% gonna die like year. That's crazy scale everyone. ...and fat. plenty websites calculate deaths per capita things called lists. I’m fortunate live country life returned normal 35 lives lost. thousands who’ve died Sweden weren’t lucky, no, wouldn’t say “in together”. *points trump*

And that... That's leader collectively chose. That’s argument, that’s bitter resentment. Try better. don’t think stupidity, pure utter selfishness. large wedding right asking people die. Hoarding. see people reacted toilet paper? F**king toilet paper. already shortage. Many, many, many frontline healthcare workers would died. mention pro sports resources this. High school games going attended ton anti-maskers. LOL go! Yes, there’s lot still away people much salty comments Reddit. Yeah sure, control... Yeah, Sweden fewer death per capita US.

It’s maybe many fat fucks US. USA stealing batches bad boys allies, like PPE. Remember guy told us masks work...? Ah, dokter fauxi, man truth new tape? thinking “old normal” meant packed crowds, bars, sporting events etc. would back. normal functioning society. agree though, hopefully we’ll start certain things better though Well, good thing lot grounded atm. We've seen beginning lot people confuse droplet airborne transmission. breathed air around you, hard people distinguish unless they're paying attention.

This Donald Trump.

Just SAYS airborne mean fully think droplet-borne early on. Thankfully meant question lol  Honestly think weirder someone knock people love gym one day long ago started selling story limitations jealously people actually hard work rise above. That's pretty weird me. No, people got fed decided live on. prime minister populist, followed suit avoid popularity drop.. saying physical exertion heart combined mild Covid symptoms causing heart conditions THINK may case? Taking gap year age isn’t going kill education.  fact older child, usually better do, increased maturity helps focus learn. orange dotard now? Everything accuse China of, actually ourselves. 

So ashamed goes climate progress made. ""Masks dont work""

-fauci anymore. 


Remember old CDC Quarantine entire Chinese neighborhood based dirty immigrants carry diseases. one out. 


Or carrying unethical human experiments African Americans. LeBron James Yeah dude sorry reading thread, come person can't things ""denigrate"" others do. think people go gyms shallow shallow making judgement. yeah, I'll say it...fitness probably much priority life. honestly sound like typical neckbeard moaning Chads gym. fucking lame...and intellectual all. Stop judgy. kids think *avoiding* testing, wouldn’t lower positive %? might muzzled might get put prison kill leave door open Lmao said “not-adults” 😂😂 I’m dead common sense controversial, know landed wrong time... got downvoted rational. Sometimes feel like people want world ending cluster fuck hasn’t turned be. 

My concerns long term damages severe cases. Maybe I’m hopeless. should, there's reason anyone think ""Florida State"" mean Florida state. Sounds like airtight case keeping schools shut actual wearing masks, I’m actually neutral it. They’re difficult wear properly. don’t wash washable ones dispose disposable ones, they’re nearly effective would wear correctly. remove incorrectly, touch face one on, might actually dangerous wearing one. think plays part weren’t adamant wearing masks. Early evidence mask effectiveness limited effectiveness spreading airborne contaminant general, whether blocked specific coronavirus. even I’m sure. Early results said needed either tight fitting n95, something like vacuum bag, furnace filter, coffee filter order Covid breach confinement mask, say use filters. don’t know know whether average mask wearer actually effective slowing transmission random person follows social distancing guidelines. 

I wear mask it’s mandated countries I’ve living (starting February country residence is, starting mid July week arrived I’m staying family). I’m glad it’s mandated. I’m best can. *Unfortunately* government isn’t allowed drag people homes... terrifying perspective  also might invade cock... giving massive boner. never used exact words ""masks dont work"" implied backed numerous examples saying dont need implied provide protection minimal protection stated people dont wear properly thats pretty much saying work, dont need em. So, Fauci led Covid response &amp; Covid response botched, Fauci considered good job? Hormones Vs. Rationale 18-21 year olds... expect? Florida Governor basically front weren’t going anything encourage mask use. That’s way one going anything it. exhausted seeing people online complaining. 

I’m saying it’s right. I’m saying absolutely one honestly gives shit. There’s protest coronoavirus measures. REAL pressure. 

I think it’s time accept Florida going model herd immunity see hell happens there. Yeah China bad! time. Welcome positive club, also 26 here, back March, anything like pretty shitty flu symptoms nothing life threatening, hope you! So, according sub, weddings well?

Holy fuck, really turning shitshow ""no fun allowed, blood, sweat tears"" FEB 28
“It’s going disappear. One day, it’s like miracle, disappear.”
— Donald Trump Please call part says masks work. 

saying public wearing saying work funny many people pressed resort ""you're troll"" accusation. last bastion someone argument. posts US, people post things US. want raise awareness situation India, post things India! lame say outright ""be change want see world"". meanwhile US Federal government tracking school outbreaks states publicly reporting someone MN, sheer amount large family gatherings I've seen past months disheartening. miss family we'll never get this. isn’t even remotely accurate... TEACHING REMOTELY!  US cases decline Europe plus rest world going up. So...no don’t think lockdown matters now. Maybe we’re something right? China showing us way beat VIRUS using SCIENCE DISCIPLINE !!! said masks dont work dismissed them, china's use them. body language also dismissive them. ok keep believing backpeddling liar care, everyone does. Care defend gain function research? 200 virologists internationally decried Obama banned? Anyone remember Pandemic II ships would aimlessly float around sea borders closed? Surprisingly spot-on.  Neither people Norway, Denmark Finland Iceland. almost like masks solution... headlines meant panic ready people. makes sound like died school started again. catch consuming food, enter respiratory system? watched 6 minutes Fauci clearly uncomfortable questions way things taken context, like headline honestly ""Especially pertains attempts minimize public concerns virus ""

lol, peanuts compared Biden find virus' origin.

I doubt he'll balls tell world. teachers strike Texas, lose pensions. ridiculous. Memory loss, speech problems (forgetting pronounce words), forgetting words completely, zoning (boyfriend says go zombie state freaks out), confusion, unable comprehend smallest things, extremely poor sense depth perception, tremors... happens daily. Ended wrecking car vision going blurry suddenly extreme confusion. There’s much haven’t mentioned it’s mess. can’t work. want life back. Thanks linking article. Regular vaccine development takes 5+ years. rushing one virtually reliable knowledge virus mechanisms. 

This side effect serious enough stop trial. That's common occurrence. 

Personally, I'm going guinea pig. don’t disagree you, using report button? Impressive ""Most people fully recover GBS, permanent nerve damage.""

From CDC website still scares shitless (paralysis) even though right probability ... nothing life certain one big crap shoot. Herd immunity specialist? young healthy 20 year old comorbidities unlikely die complications covid. 

This nonsense reasoning used reopen schools across country shut leads massive outbreaks.

Furthermore, actually don’t know long term effects actual covid infection are. *don’t know* young people future complications covid. idea long term effects contracting virus are.

We used let kids get infected chickenpox knew effects mild unlikely kill them. later learned chickenpox actually causes long term effects. human body never fully defeats chickenpox virus, actually goes hiding human body re-emerges decades later attack immune system weak person gets old virus causes shingles.

When HIV virus first emerged doctors thought mild flu. Nobody knew years later HIV virus could re-emerge cause AIDS.

We idea long term effects SARS-Cov 2 virus be. return later like shingles HIV? it, never goes away like herpes?

Waiting around letting people get infected die much much riskier experimental vaccine trial. not? I'm cool bot nuking sure! yes US should, but.... many anti-maskers, shitty leader. give fuck lives. interview said *i've known since february infected dangerus flue wanna get people panic like keep saying this*, really? Trump people could save much lives ignorant asshole🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 “Might”, yes I’m sure that’s they’re trying figure out. large sample size pick number illnesses random unrelated drug investigation. still thoroughly investigate them. Many kids access online resources, resources available disadvantage disabled. problem ""if literally one N95 mask, donate it"". one thing protect 70 year old father? know rednecks feel people want take guns.

While believe kindness others ultimately gets us this, many us survival mode. Nope! China send experienced doctors Italy fight pandemic. Except not, neurological issues common side effect vaccine low number mistake try see single virus.

In tape Trump actually talking virus strain China, makes sense already knew different strain. deploy something dangerous unless convinced backfire.

What count D614G, also known ""two play game"" neither, bud. Gotta tear fascist down. point somewhere showing fake? rather dead fat Okay, 26 million COVID cases many reinfected? Even 10,000 cases still .04% chance. put perspective, chance drafted NFL team .09%. Sounds like make good volunteer start touring retirement homes Florida aging father distinction 'likely cases' reinfection vs 'confirmed cases.' Cases confirmed actual genetic analysis first strain second strain... super rare reinfection necessarily rare, b/c genetic analysis patients' strains commonly done.

I'm guessing Guinea reporting least 15 cases 'likely re-infection' - people coronavirus recovered appear caught months later. plenty likely re-infections seen elsewhere too. going capable 'confirmed' data first infection analyzed/compared second one. need make like tree get hit bus filled bricks. hsve already seen mental health issues skyrocket year, hardly They’re really good projecting. data. You’re smart. thing saying people said “WHO declared animals cannot become infected.” No, didn’t. said evidence animals could become infected, plenty evidence Covid similar SARS plenty evidence animals could transmit SARS. lucky turned animals play significant role spread. could like MERS, spread easily throughout Middle East camel. 

I wish would admitted “there evidence masks reduce potential spread disease; however, United States shortage disposable surgical masks, ask cover nose mouth bandana, scarf, homemade face covering.”

It’s pretty obvious countries encouraging mandating population wear masks. It’s mind boggling Americans chose ignore favour “authority’s” recommendations. Still going stop eating sushi. saw YouTube! gotcha, bit change course ""masks protect everyone Covid"" ""masks help catch little bit Covid"". started human reddit reprogrammed me? known cases.

It's obvious removed it. barely outbreaks China. american virus articles pertaining American doctors allowed! suspect virus December (way first confirmed Brazil). take blood test detect antigen, higher chance false positive it’s long? (considering suspicion correct) barely make assholes waste. goes hyperinflated rent insurance(s). Makes mad people throw away thousands dollars month whatever, peers lucky ""earn"" 1.5K month. Secondary education *really* pays off. Dont feel sorry. start pandemic lockdowns lot landlords sitting asses demanding rent payed tenants could move lockdown didnt jobs afford it. turntables guess old news. knew months ago depends get generic meds. name brands cost numbers quoting, generic 20 month. Covid also fixated obesity. It’s known long enough obesity makes incredibly vulnerable Covid (and generally poor health) yet get plenty stories “healthy” individuals die Covid reality nothing healthy them. 

I want accureatly reported. person didn’t die teacher infected students, died overweight got virus destroys overweight people.

It’s sucks she’s gone feel bad family preventable many levels. teacher absolutely nothing it’s bullshit headline meant drive fear nothing more. RIP Demetria. considering going US going world, everybody prob keep that's focus headline? Probably lot. Lol! crock nonsense.

When people want believe something, they'll cling sort tidbit justify ignorance, even 6 months back virus new one clue worked not. 

Might well say trust doctors medical treatment hundreds years back thought witchcraft made people sick. 50% population already immune, pandemic would slow crawl. wont fix it. doesn’t study origin virus

yes does, able draw conclusion. read would know that. Totally understand perspective working home weeks ago, however, gym insanely well cleaned (every hour sanitize) top everyone wearing masks everyone top cleaning machines/weights use themselves. I've also already semi recently COVID (negative now) fine I'm worried taking precautions act carrier, wearing mask routinely sanitizing. I'm also tested weekly free area (Seattle), get day-of walkin tests results returned within 48 hours. Yes, sticking head sand always solves problems. competent government. point. brought cases california like 13k day thousand day without locking down. way people businesses buy locking again. Wait, start handling raw meat fish might germs?! world coming to? Oh knew February, that's deployed, know it'll backfire. /r/iamverysmart calling name.

Also, ridiculously easy vote Iowa. full shit regard. really bad living Iowa. sure problems damn, hate much move? prefer recognized level 5 NPC, thank much. Unless missed it, never said ""masks anything all"". said ""the public go buy masks right now"". Remember medicine ensuring best life people, necessary take financial means consideration. 

For individual risk low likely nobody nearby disease, wearing mask silly. wear masks time even though might help prevent diseases, costs involved taking safety precautions. beginning, still case, there's arbitrary point decide risk worth cost.

For country, logic pretty easy follows on. Even without lying people, totally possible healthcare workers cross threshold past arbitrary cost/safety line. makes sense would high risk, much higher average person.

What great messaging super explicit masks might useful recommended right now. also know much virus time Trump administration going shank hard, may considering long term messaging points. Also lots technical science people problems communicating laypeople, hard remember little people know anything talking about. would head French National Health Security Agency source. know better? Lol. Bye now.  mean early 2021 mean “Planning release January” “we know March latest”? Another round lockdowns would need military enforcement.

The military won’t put one damn bit “come get me” mentality.  read Indonesian news regularly. would group Indonesia along Brazil, USA India. covid19 quite saturated there. hope Latin American brethren become indebted Guinea pigs Chinese. would hope would wait legitimately tested vaccines. end determining adverse effect due vaccine, straight fail trial?

Hell place Earth. lead Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years.

At least we’ve got entire miserable month January may slow though.

Then Valentines Day. Boom. sure getting at. I'm suggesting breaking relatively harmless rule facilitate following important ones actually affect people.  great articles response 1918 flu epidemic, include cities like Cleveland ordering police force arrest anyone spat public, jailtime anyone wearing mask SF, mask orders around country.

Pandemics different inadvertently giving someone common cold year. new morality take extra steps protect neighbors deadly pandemic. someone knowingly showed party flu then, I'm sure people would pissed someone showing party Covid today.

Nobody saying sit house never ever step out. country shut down, go get takeout food sit park eat it. absolutely workable. would think international traveler's would want avoid coming U.S. Right plague central virus running rampant huge percent population refusing take common sense precautions. Exaggerating risk virus harmful society minimizing it. think what? China may communist lack free press, hard imagine able hide tragedy scale completely unchecked COVID-19 epidemic. think many thousands healthcare workers seen massive influx mysterious respiratory illnesses matching description COVID-19, would find way spread stories outside world. depends.

Right effect blunted due many people wearing masks distancing. quality available protective equipment took sharp turn upwards second wave hit -- N95s everyone, lot options better cut-up T-shirt available now.

While end community transmission, reduces quantity viral particles average infection stems from, appears direct correlation severity symptoms. overall, we've shifted severity cases downwards big way. actually like common cold lot people now, especially shift towards younger average age infected persons.

If get false sense security, lots people stop wearing masks start making strangers tinder again, likely going see quick uptick severe cases, means hospitalizations.. covering done go back emergency action hospitals fill again. kills hype vaccine anytime soon. said reports claiming based comments company's CEO confirming participant clinical trial suffered transverse myelitis ""incorrect"".

They stated specific version report incorrect, ruled transverse myelitis may suspected. believe NY Times ever claimed report based comments CEO, may part disputing.

And serving drinks everyone business class flight. Effectively encouraging everyone take masks multiple times prolonged periods time, flight.

What fuck everyone thinking? 

Oh that’s right. American Airlines wants people enjoy flight retain customers make money, rather give shit health science. Got it.

Source: flew Phoenix Miami Puerto Rico American last week. know range is? 6 24 times reported would put US number 36 million 144 million

So assume top end range? suggested China reached herd immunity, that's started argument. Even sources provided, pretty clear argument hold water, bye.

So wrong number cases US researchers believe necessary herd immunity. That's wonderful. Hopefully informed days going forward. I've wearing mask since first week February people would look like I'm crazy knowing really going on.

But important call blatant hypocrisy people like argue bad faith disingenuous general. Thia happened countless times, again. keep trusting people bad shit legal repercussions? naive... Bro I'm really hoping even need vaccine everything's over.

So go highest admit wrong. used references attempt disprove argument. started backtrack used references fact check claims.

You said thought herd immunity 70%. wrong.

You said US 6 million cases. wrong.

What wrong about, again? realize using ""appeal authority"" logical fallacy, right?  think that? they? evidence that? China ten times cases 2020, travel restrictions evidence ***now***, numbers. implication probably true. university shy away tribe though:


1) give free tuition member tribe applies live reservation Oklahoma


2) we're helping tribe reconstruct lost language. think they're 500 words so. native speakers left, pretty heavy lift


3) used Miami Redskins. renamed Miami Redhawks sometime early 2000s without tribe come us ask


4) Myamee museum campus


5) take students Oklahoma every year participate tribe's spring dances 6 x 6 144?

Can read? article referenced mention US number least *6 24 times* reported

Just admit wrong. used references attempt disprove argument. started backtrack used references fact check claims. fucking shit ah makes sense. hope kitty better! LOL, confirmed kept taking off, making flight attendant wrong.

Taking little bit talking acceptable. Wow really blaming people food stamps rather billion dollar corporations getting tax cuts? 

What strange thing focus on. listen speaks might gotten sidelined still spoke plus lot scientists supported Feed babies whole grapes show trust them. oughta help. /s Yeah, kind made even worse, there's one thing people, give shit anyone else. never said were. regardless whether China tested people many people dying go unnoticed. would also leaked videos overwhelmed hospitals throughout country like ones came Wuhan early days pandemic. Yea like Sweden super low numbers too! people travelling right probably safety minded concerning covid least disproportionately compared general population. it’s choice dying coronavirus I’m done. Wonder sub post story Trump distort impact virus. wrong matter hoew asked. mad 100% understandable. Everyone plane mad. Asked answered yourself! Maybe meant, certainly said. Imagine trusting Chinese covid count lol 97% people sufficient vitamin ever go ICU.

77% people sufficient vitamin wven contract covid19.

There end pandemic. Get vitamin levels checked start supplementing vitamin d.

49= americans deficient vitamin D.


Who needs potentially dangerous vaccine? I! feel like comment appreciated. couple reasons Fauci didn’t say airborne. word “airborne” difficult define scientifically. Different fields study use word differently. one criteria determine virus airborne contagion. February, scientists certainly thought could get air, defining airborne much trickier. Really. thought situation teacher unions for. memberships cheap. China 10 cases yesterday. fully opened schools, factories, gyms, pools, hotels, nursing homes. 10 cases, easy testing contact tracing. 

Meanwhile US stuck limbo...that continues continues. traditional retail, restaurants, gyms closing. corporations closing offices going permanent work home. 

Compare China's GDP vs US's GDP past year. math simple backed economic measurements. symptoms related spinal cord signals reaching rest body. Nothing ""manic episode"". help President equates wearing mask lack masculinity. ""I'm jumping box poisonous snakes."" ""Pansy."" asked accepts Chinese numbers. answer: EU does. never even mentioned US except serve contrast. Automoderator removed comment spelled word hadn't. guess that's sign though run course. 

I'm outraged. clear data everything he's said wanted hospitals get PPE shortage, saw data supported non-medical-quality masks, even handled improperly, reducing spread covid changed stance. 

All underpinnings even interview. language, even back then, even changing recommendation, consistent. get outraged this. actually see guy little tap dance order save lives hospital workers. record, agree disingenuous, make single false statement clip.

I started saying OK someone change stance given new data, still contend that's did. sure beliefs changed stance, guess matter he'd change it? nth time news related South Korea ""South SE Asia"" tag. South Korea South SE Asia? Well, guess South Dakota South America. want constituents perish prematurely? “But she’s dead!” That’s matters anti-maskers. Never mind horrible quality life. 103 died.

103 / 513,000 = 0.02

So that's CFR 0.02%. However, diagnosed cases 20% infections, IFR &lt;18 years wonder voting November. May God protect poor people. Everyone's wearing cloth masks they're abundant know they're bizarrely effective goal manage rather prevent, reason allowed leaders decide best course action based partial information. uk told safe enough work die, safe enough meet friends family, little contradictory. It’s unfortunate - state gym go small (yet every fan high AC basically time it’s pretty (hopefully) well ventilated) maybe 60-70% time, nobody gym mask on. get - it’s hard breathe you’re working out, seeing shit like scares lot. said, city seeing cases go recently likely opening colleges here, it’s still less 120/day. lowest got 15 day. city 330,000. 

I really love going gym I’ve going 4 5 days week last 12 weeks, I’m sure want stop now, I’m really good wiping things I’m done even people don’t. college kids bad habit wiping shit they’re done it. Idk come small ass gym! fucking MASSIVE college gym, stay hell away mine! thought price would deter - it’s $70 month it’s monthly there’s contract sign - sadly. gets much worse might cancel. :( 

All said, went today MAYBE 6 people there. seems randomly packed.

That's really weird set circumstances. Here's bag 200 skittles. One kill you. eat skittles? uncertainty, everyone community knew masks helped reduce viral load, dig deep enough you’ll see many us tried get word out, people like Dr Fauci spread misinformation faster could get truth there.

CDC, mild side effects flu shot include soreness, redness swelling injection site, low-grade fever aches. 1 percent 2 percent people get flu shot fever side effect, Schaffner said.

3) yep. Shady. 

And there's more, they've slowed trials. want ones first vaccine (it would turn well them). They've also fighting governmental oversight trials.  

Moderna no-go.  still hopes Oxford/AZ one, MAYBE Pfizer one. kids teach kids? kids work lunch counter? kids run recess? kids principal? could take vitamin normal benefits , slight chance ALSO helps covid. I'm sure studies come years come, something simple do, might well. also stay hydrated plenty water get lots sleep, probably helps too. alarmist reactionary. I’ve stayed ahead population due sub.

Obviously there's real concern people coming state borders NYC dealing whole time managed Good call, let edit it. explain option 2 good economy? sounds counterintuitive ""sold"" honest even something like potentially happening 1 1000 doses example, would absolutely still take vaccine otherwise efficacious. Much higher chance dying virus let alone non fatal effects serious.

I hope stuff like lead massive delays vaccines rolled even many scrapped. would lead virus contuing spread contiuing restrictions worldwide would far worse potentially 1 thousand people getting seriously injured vaccines. keep fucking mask wash god damn hands get home. hard shit.... fuckin tards Foreshadowing? let's screw Pelosi wall indoor haircut one person. Sigh Source? 1,000 clinical trial experts working specifically clinical trials COVID vaccine? Wow. Could link source? Whats adult child ratio positive tests.. curious kids effect theory holding up.. appears even funding criminal problem persist many crimes solved. 

I agree here, believe funding goes far towards police’s efficacy crime solving/prevention.

I believe effective training factors come play.

But sure police department success rate anything giving tickets worthy tax dollars.

I’m quite sure I’m fully understanding here.

Are saying percentage taxes go towards police efficiently used handing tickets?

If so, mean you’d prefer switched back old days would respond calls people paid them?

Or that, believe efficacy isn’t tied current level funding afforded tax dollars cut off, ability police wouldn’t lessened? can't test virus incubation period, I'll still contagious? ""Expert"" say something contradictory Fauci saying, would trust more? knowingly put unsafe product there’s paper trail hurried political reasons, get sued orbit. Typically people preface narrator.

Narrator: didn't. Lets make America fatter, muzzle get less oxygen, increase immunity 'Covid19' Source? Imagine AstraZeneca Chinese company. Racist reddit would condemning shitty UK products, right? European, find weird. mind me! thnk important, undermined. 

The fucking president posting threats twitter FDA regarding approving vaccine election, calling deep state shit like that. quarantine whole area lmao probably lower Florida's numbers dramatically Free immunity everyone, oh wait herd immunity much effective. Alright every man themselves. Run life!!! Im studying biotech manufacturing focus vaccines therapeutics. 

The disparity amount general public knows vaccines whole vs think know vast. speak many people “know they’re talking about” god hurts. 

I someone tell “no that’s right doesn’t make sense,” explained vaccines inoculated diseases. words, dumbfounded insistent that’s vaccines work they’re really anything. Like bruh cuz don’t get something doesn’t make true. 


One thing I’m happy though widespread focus vaccine Covid bringing lot information general public vaccines are, work, process behind developing vaccine. live LA area want go new Sofi stadium looks fucking nice. Now, no. 5 months ago, yes. could go gym it’s simple.

I’m dating “old” person. would need isolated too. upper bound deaths 2 million Americans. 

Now we’re projected 400k deaths year’s end.

We live world longer scientific consensus, politicized can’t govern country effectively anymore.

option 1 lockdown whole country let death count go up. 
Option 2 allow economy back open.

Albeit counterintuitive, Option 1 best option health economy. 

Option 2 good option.

And previously mention option 3, let chaos reign, actually did... worst option 3. That’s we’re getting projected 400k dead eternal lock downs, wait vaccine. GenXer maxed campaign contribution Sanders campaign try change economic trajectory country on.

Your ""fuck you"" attitude side keeps winning, can't fight that, become one them. Wow. unbelievable.

*see previous comment base who's information trust purely authority ignore anything questionable motives possible conflicts interest? lot Redditors see post get upset, consciously not. see anyone respond argument.

Their perspective article spot too. beyond frustrating little impact spotty lockdowns without national plan back up. Small businesses seriously suffering (especially bars restaurants), matter shut down, next state may still major outbreak emerging, spread state lines soon things get ""under control"" start reopen.

God damn, seriously wish GOP would wake fuck realize they're absolutely WRECKING economy horseshit. national GDP fell 33% last quarter, expect even worse results next report. service industry 50%, live events gone (they contribute $2 trillion economy every year), chapter 11 bankruptcies skyrocketing, etc... stock market continues soar. country's economic foundation turning dust crumbling beneath us, people living top floor quit throwing massive parties shaking whole building.  true, started another treason comforting Theatricality TSA ""making America safe"" (threat-meter goes orange).

I think company also said definite connection vaccine drop whole trial. wrote. “There data, none, zero, across entire world, shows children especially young children, spread virus children, adults teachers. None. occur, risk essentially zero”

Anyone kids vouch fact colds flu spread school problem. Duhhh I'm still taking rushed vaccine country world positive GDP growth second quarter, speaks itself.  time writing, source used showed Korean imported infected China 19 several months. number 23 (as 6 Sep), line regions similar populations hundreds cases.

I'm one early hard hit areas... Yea, I’m gonna call bullshit that. fyi anyone reading this, comment nearly gave heart attack (I bf ~22%) - 25% figure men. Seems like 32% cutoff obesity women. sounds special. South China Morning Post reliable source propaganda? familiar them. I'm NY gym I've enforced everything T.. mostly us absolutely need gym preferred method training grateful back happy accommodate anything.. huge boost quality life, I'd despondent close again. Lol insult like. take man's word everything. believe looking sources information blindly accepting information taught blindly accept information from. want keep can't stop you, go ahead.

What mean ""there companies past happened""?

I'll bet Fauci absolutely 0 conflicts interest, that's funneled millions dollars lab Wuhan. Probably coincidence though. government people, people run like modern corporation. matters economic quarter looks. Ideally cause it'll mean COVID done gone. one knows. Either October, November, December, January, February, March. Getting different driver, wear masks car windows open minimize speaking vehicle would reasonably safe. Interesting commentary except conclusion:


 “We safe effective Covid-19 vaccine research studies, engagement processes, communication, education efforts undertaken clinical trial stage built trust result vaccination recommendations understood, supported, accepted vast majority public, priority nonpriority groups alike.” 

They still give us timeline. ☹️ mild symptoms caused covid, probably. Best wear mask aren’t sure. That’s fine, vaccine eventually come out, don’t take one. rest us good thin herd people can’t think logically. governor Brazil's São Paulo state said Wednesday Phase 3 clinical trials potential COVID-19 vaccine developed China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd shown promising results may available Brazilians early December.

This phase 3 trial involves 9,000 volunteers. ""what real UK is"" - yikes! week breaking international law, next week bring??

Nothing actually changed yet still transition period, 1st Jan going interesting lorries start piling - happening regardless deal deal. stupid peasants find fuss about... Man guy bubbles lungs living nightmare. No. source says, ""The secondary attack rate COVID-19 among **household contacts** 10.3% study, consistent secondary attack rates 11.2% cities China (20) 10.5% United States (21)"" presymptomatic spread accounts 11% cases. Youre spreading misinformation. Nah, like forever virus crippled economy, fix it? lend credence argument viral load plays part severity illness? says, ""The secondary attack rate COVID-19 among **household contacts** 10.3% study, consistent secondary attack rates 11.2% cities China (20) 10.5% United States (21)"" presymptomatic spread accounts 11% cases. Youre spreading misinformation. think lied? source? mean fauci specifically, White House Trump agencies currently trump admin. also sure mean ""gain function""? Explain that?

The quote recently found ""I regret anything said context time said it, correct."" definitely admitting lying. hope government sues back responsible infecting everyone sell blood hundreds thousands. sneaking cracks. fascist cancer surging America tickling way toward Canada's lymph nodes. y'all get serious quick end problems some. ??? think America contact tracers?

I think that's inspired WALL-E cant feasibly wait long term effects every virus known Thanks! hope goes smooth tomorrow. Hope mri went well result media, mainstream social both. topic trending THAT'S FUCKING DISCUSSED six months straight, people think thing exists. media ran headline every person dies flu, would fear too. keep no. 1 spot almost three months lock downed careless pieces shit  Temp 92.4, good go sir! help discuss herd immunity stuff what's done done. astonishes people refuse see what's right front eyes. conspiracy. fact Giesecke, Tegnell pals going straight herd immunity unknown virus. Things could left that, accept facts. maybe people consider guys trusted handle things maybe could experts capable leading response. BUT, see naivety people trying spin like Gie Teg going herd immunity. That's keeps discussion going. There's reason spin it. fucked response completely. wanted let virus spread, slowly enough ICUs could handle it(after realizing Italy situation countries locking that) . Without knowing effects virus. make worse mistake unknown clearly dangerous virus. lot decisions they're making still guided cover various mistakes instead admitting badly fucked up. Similar things happened Finland (where I'm from) authorities government. They're worried covering mistakes instead improving response virus situation. earlier first confirmed US case? Absolutely. scale people think, large number people sick early stage. Viruses spread slowly first ramp up, exponential growth. 

If truly widespread timeframe people like think would seen ton irregular hospitalizations, death, pneumonia, etc. know bad year colds flu, plenty friends family got sick, lingering coughs, etc. doubt COVID.  Honestly, don’t. like Canada. like Canadians I’ve met. think country beautiful. often think nice would become citizen live there. wouldn’t let us right now. American handled shit right shows. pathetic. hold us higher standard. mean government statistics country. Sweden also example minimal restrictions working. Pretty sure better us. Also example, keep mind wearing mask deacreases chance die covid 50%, half 0.02% 0.01% chance. would statisticly insignificant  Use tactical rifles virus, armor piercing rounds, run virus truck! significant spreading events right side history. pay close attention events superspreading events intention public view event seem strongest indicators outcome.

Don’t hard numbers I’ve told it’s almost 100% obese elderly ICU. great majority obese BMI 40+. 

Now fairly low pop area talking 9-18 patients time ICU. Whoops, get angry bud. need federal leadership period. still tons leadership positions agencies directors? quite acting directors well. participate protests? not, reasoning? so, trust people these? Fauci said 2 months  Choudhry, three-year-old wearing mask, although tried get one onto 19-month-old – even though mandate kids two – resisted got upset eventually threw up.


Children young need mask. they've assessed exact data everyone else came different conclusion risk. bravery involved.  Damn guess it’s tough list one reason lol name, called existential dread ;)

Just kidding. feel like I've getting closer peace pandemic, although I'm fairly low-risk category one know who's infected gotten seriously ill. Anyways, I'm hoping people able come peace danger, without totally reverting old ways living. example, I'm highly physically isolated, wear mask public always, dine go parties, etc. I'm little worried go work clinic today, but, like said, I'm much peace general back March April. really another layer risk top risks life, although quite thick layer... understand correctly hadn’t attended day school students yet, don’t think need worry third graders dealing guilt. Still campus sometimes, completely remote, right? comment makes like completely remote school nothing all. also unprecedented pandemic kill 675000 Americans despite wearing masks football games.  number known risk factors:

 * Staying enclosed space
 * Air circulation without effective filtering pathogens (e.g. HEPA)
 * Extended duration stay
 * Inability wear mask eating drinking
 * Contact staff constant contact many guests I’m confused, wouldn’t make meaningful? terms Proving 65+ greater risk? Smaller sample size still majority deaths wide margin. Please meet others..... till.  damn...what say? pointing possible benefit obvious covid prevention. Fauci put pedestal media. line doesnt work regular people dont hold fauci paragon truth.  zombie flick felt relevant? Definitely watch it! mentality young people risk less old ones dangerous. USA leapfrogged half mentioned countries already. Spain UK coming next. pretty good case:fatality ratio comes Covid. Yes correct. Gig companies take big cut (drivers , much) flip side, restaurant pay drivers anything get deliver miles away, potentially untapped revenue. It’s patriot act benefits politicians big corporations. Mask mandates outside pandemic benefit nobody aside maybe patients operation. bars schools? Looked high blood pressure, screwed, like beer diet crap.😕 Tl:Dr

In lavish ceremony Great Hall People Beijing, Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, recognised select group citizens contributions country’s fight Covid-19 praised party’s resilience faced “an extraordinary historic test”.

But missing list national heroes one individual comes mind many Chinese citizens: doctor Li Wenliang, ophthalmologist hospital Wuhan “disciplined” local authorities trying warn colleagues virus.

Angry omission, citizens flooded Li’s last post Weibo tributes. Welp, found accurate depressing observation day. That's sister. got 5 years retirement full pension really want quit yet. Thankfully school district made call go online, holed home.

Of course, daughter college. tested positive. Normally kid would come home dinner (she goes local uni) obviously quarantined sister Uber Eats delivered instead. Poor thing. Lol problem indeed nuanced fucking solution given people know fuck talking fucking simple. Stay inside much u wear fucking masks. two things ignored morons problem getting worse. Granted know solution given final solution, one still ignored fucking morons ""party friends"" god forbid spend time alone homes fuck intelligent people say. ""Well, gotta die something."" - cousin excuses debunked. Coronavirus killed people every terrorist plane attack ever combined. we’ve done away theater, away TSA screening finally? literally pass due lack air, they're wearing mask wrong (or wrong mask) issues health need investigated. I've done cardio mask myself, exactly pleasant, never even remotely close passing out. kind curious utility usage would change result people working home. Possibly less electricity/gas usage businesses change temperature unoccupied areas. Water usage may go residences people working home thus using toilet more, etc. I've definitely since November 2016 truth still reported FYI, Japan getting lot better that. latest generation CEOs worker conscious previous ones. mean proliferated everywhere (especially huge companies like Sony), improving. Sturgis?  care please play sidesim try imply samd Trump: we're going heard immunity. may die sacrifice I'm willing make. Neither “riot” “gig” “festival” mean anything point view virus spread. 

Did people masks? mostly outside inside? inside, dense long? inside, quietly listening opposed singing shouting? intoxicated aka caring less hygiene distancing?

You 30 people inside singing room (no matter it’s rock hymns) super spreader event. 3000 people large park, wearing masks, sharing drinks food - maybe contamination. Protecting public health govt overreach  point US likely spresd cohbtries, way around would safe say 8 hours public setting interact hundreds different people?

I feel school setting extra safe number people environment constant. someone sick, social tracking easy outbreaks controlled.

We idea long pandemic going last living parents basement forever option point.

People need work earn money can't forced stay home look kids would otherwise school. Look, I’m anti-mask man, far it. I’m saying based personal encounters I’ve seen people playing basketball village pass due low intake air. I’m saying complete cancellation sports would safe smarter approach this. It’s quite surprising high-school collegiate level sports still going pandemic. I’m worried players based I’ve seen, would like complete safety. Twice many people dying car crashes covid. CDC even reports mortality numbers back normal 94% ""covid deaths"" average 2.6 causes death. 

Covid ""CASES INCREASING"" headlines nothing click bait people easily scared. article prove said? even mention getting infected different strains. 

Over 90% developes antibodies decline even 4 months. Getting reinfected probably happen cases probably rare. temperature check useless screening process yet stores, apartments, etc yse it. Many patients dpnt even fever barely day 2 entire 14 day illness would trust numbers all? even entertaining discussion might merit?

We even uestion numbers yet casually reference Russian numbers mean something less thread they've forged vaccine data... mean sarcastic - nonprofit would affect stock price? I'll gabagoo please like Sweden population massively skewed towards elderly one taking voluntary precautions. cousin Florida PROM April might want check tag, particular Calgary Canada. No, right, capitalist system working perfect. allows unions flourish teachers heard, student lives come first.

/s

Like one commented, school used stimulus money fresh painting flooring. protect Covid. And, even sending kids back school? really what's best right now? Yes know teachers need support families income. better system needed. perspective, 108 days since Memorial Day normal year approximately 864,000 Americans would died time period. Lol no, u go ""have fun"" pandemic moron, stay inside fucking scientists say. time fun party's fuck sake lol, thousands people dying daily basis, figure satiate childish need social interaction way stop spreading disease that's killing people.

Sorry buddy...our education standards wee bit higher USA.

Our military budgets get spent books, educational tools. One could argue opposite. Artificially suppressing virus transmission among young healthy people extremely low risk bad outcomes prolongs pain. 

Some believe virus stay, vaccine vaccine. favour harm-reduction approach: take sensible precautions like hand washing staying home sick, protect vulnerable people want extra protection (I don’t), let people live lives. I'm AC technician, I'm custodian, use give me, spray, wipe, mop, fog!!!! Oh, yeah, l take care 7 bathrooms, front office, teachers lounge break room. Deliver furniture, break set classrooms.

It'll gone everybody died it. grew little north Franklin Co, extreme pushback masks unbelievable. Watching people Facebook bizarre MD everyone wears mask. daughter attending small preschool kids wear masks, pushback parents. obvious. huge impact tho. people passed since didn’t get enough air.

When hit first grade mom signed summer programs keep busy far would die US went back normal attempt get herd immunity. Yah. We're gonna keep deleting day day matter much gets posted. study trash misinformation. removed. teacher teaching online? see sound? doubt. imagine many people get tested covid.

Same US everywhere else. peak, might 200,000 cases day US! Well really, even bother. It’s pretty much storming it’s way US unchecked. International visitors likely get bring them. may 2nd wave US. one long continous ongoing wave duration. Well, somebody died so... Ooooooh, heaven place earth.

The juxtaposition song story very.... dark. ever south dakota? Look density. middle nowhere. go south dakota plan around human beings, indoors least really made realize uneducated majority country one person Aftonbladets chat yesterday claiming tested positive May yesterday. chat reporter replied heard cases got confirmed reinfection yet. 
But Sweden rarely genome sequencing virus get confirmed reinfections easy. 
My guess would possible even without genome data first infection. genome sequencing virus second positive test possible see matches current circulating strains looks like relapse strain May.

Here screenshot facebook told Corona virus spread outdoors. protesters ok. event outdoors well? Yeah pretty much. Remember couple thousand nationwide cause alarm March? it’s like oh we’ve gotten 30,000 per day we’re almost winning someone read scientific papers journals regular basis article pretty shitty. think people understand something posted internet published journal, make science good science matter.

I think entire country needs educated scientific consensus means. anti-americanism needs stop mods need step in. ruining sub anything approaching useful relevant. example, I've perused 4 topics morning, every single one upvoted anti american statement nothing story. example, posted new topic teacher died Covid:

&amp;#x200B;

"" imagine logical American way tackle equip kid gun. ""

&amp;#x200B;

geezus christ reddit. Mods, get shit together. Okay, let's look China. lied virus months, disclosure unavoidable. time, suppress whistleblowers, including man originally broke news, subsequently died infection. lockdown, welded door shut, publicly beat people defied shutdown, lied number cases. reported 22 million privately owned cell phones China gone dark since started. may death, even 10% due death, that's 2.2 million people. Way United States death toll. think American public would react types measures? Especially rioters, looters, arsonist progressive left devastated major American cities last 4 months? thing understand reply government fascist enough. assertion? government even fascist dealing this? let economy completely sink? definitely hurt poor disaffected much wealth ride measures. Ok, let's say Joe Biden put office January 20th.

 would help covid?

Because point vaccine pretty available, available everyone, Pfizer(the leading vaccine candidate) putting 100 million end year. Keep mind US government completely botched response pandemic overflowing numbers, privilege using similar approaches countries. think would best course action.

1. Children 6th grade need online schooling. government needs implementing FDR levels government support online schooling along subsidizing, tax breaks, whole 9 yards. also needs guidelines whenever parents able online classes accomodations government funding help parents.

2. Kids 5th grade lower need held back year graduate 19 since online schooling appears effective age group. literally way contain virus realistic manner sucks, government's fault begin option considered. time next school year kicks in, virus **should** control. Parents need stay home babysit kids school need able sign newly implemented government 
program program provide money resources parents missing usual income. government would need provide funding teachers schools sore money since school year need support well. people need receiving stimulus check regular one that. could afford lot making massive cuts military, even minor ones honestly.

This would probably best approach containing virus, obviously would require competent leadership excellent governing skills. One side one person standing way nothing done. administration done things downright evil image would problem injecting us vaccine fully tested. yeah I’ll wait Dr. Fauci says it’s ok he’s already come said it’s unlikely election. shortage masks needed healthcare workers

The US eventually figured could countries done months earlier recommend cloth masks. really need CDC report confirm this? 

Any event large bound superspreading event. Especially masks used social distancing thing. level western capitalism countries

Real quick, I'd love define success. Currently america number one incarceration, constitution prisoners used slave labor. country really ""successful"" got backs slaves? people country celebrate ""success"" rich powerful. actually seasonal flu deadly children coronavirus, coronavirus deadly adults seasonal flu. country fucking joke affordable daycare, especially midst pandemic.

I think country joke; full wonderful people broad range backgrounds, makes lovely place. said, pandemic exposed fundamental social problems inequities need addressed ever want move forward. Certainly race, gender, etc. problems (though would argue moved forward many compared even 40-50 years ago), think biggest issue need address economic, impacts everyone matter color skin, gender, etc.

We lot people struggling economically country supposedly resources country world. going get worse things like automation AI continue emerge evolve economy. really going look ways help create better social ""bottom line"" I'm afraid we'll start see protesting turn much violent future. could four things right now, would be:

1. Institute Universal Basic Income, supported Value-Added Tax redirection funds existing programs. program essentially pay itself, simply take funds available distribute evenly/accordingly.

2. End failed war drugs. Decriminalize *usage* drugs, make sale marijuana legal institute federal tax it. Legalize medical usage substances used treatment mental health disorders, according efficacy tested medical science research. Use part funds tax marijuana support addiction treatment safe-usage centers. Begin treating drug addiction mental health issue rather criminal issue.

3. Institution tutition-free, national university, similar [the Open University Lean heavily online courses, allow in-person testing centers, make accredited institution. Pay remainder marijuana tax revenue.

4. Implement national health care. Divert funds companies currently paying health insurance tax cover it. companies this, they'll start (with limitations small/local businesses). Redirect funding Medicaid/Medicare pay well.

Once done things, LOT stress society go away. People lose jobs paychecks away living street. People want quit job take chance business hobby stay home watch kids that. People stop incarcerated needlessly using drugs, people truly addiction problem able get help need. People free access education raise collective knowledge country. people stop going bankrupt avoiding taking care health.

All done, simply need choose it. Fuck racist log every day post thousands upvotes Uighur genocide, yet region still flourishing population count dropping. don’t think going waves Yes like 3 countries argue worse US right now. make US safer sudden though luck: saw news last month saying schools try reopen. 🤦‍♀️ schools starting week. Deaths teachers students means inevitably even students back, risk level goes even higher everyday exposure without kids. 

Trust me, I’m teacher district that’s already deaths (they’re keeping secret there’s many articles you’re seeing) kids came back yesterday. I’ve dealt coworkers testing positive already, evidence spreads even among teachers. Don’t downplay risk teachers taking adding hundreds kids mix, it’s real. We’re entering uncharted territory here, I’m tired people saying evidence yet common sense spread people die. means 3-4 shots year it’s permanent rushed maybe line becomes permanent longer threat we’ve eradicated it. Yea, don’t like needles I’ll gladly take vaccine whimper little maybe pop canny I’ll fine. that’s borders stay closed. Trump built wall, right, around ‘Merica. flu deadly children. Sweden defense hilarious. Go crunch numbers. basically advocating 16 million 30 million dead Americans. last numbers saw death rate .05%. Apply US get lot dead people. Populations different, friend. mod remove whatever reason, post way relevant dozens Dr Fauci posts allowed sub little Yup. Teachers buy classroom supplies. Cops get moved different department killing guy. must act meet groups 6!

^(except places makes government money...) teacher sadly died covid. *not* contracted person teaching (she remote). Unknown picked socializing teachers friends/family. Roanoke must testing much cities similar population number VA. numbers add comparatively. nursing home wife's grandmother went public 50 patients 30 staff tested positive. Oh 6 deaths number. 


People around still act like there's virus nothing worry about. city time bomb. People grocery stores definitely getting away improper masking inside store and, someone still going office every day since started, mask usage loosely adhered lot workplaces well. people work factories, laboratories, “hidden industry” kept society going year work home crowd isn’t selling headlines... thing making (possibly) worse teachers around kids warned SARS ""like"" disease, post based report says SARS Must taken quite leap logic get discussed statement. post gives overview accomplishments individuals receiving medals: 

Not saying Li deserve recognition, already honored martyr. 

P.s., Guardian talking Chinese anger. Ironically, Chinese folks know seem upset. sub completely overrun chinabots lately. There's point subscribing anymore.

Hit -50 y'all. Tiananmen square. Winnie Pooh. Tibet. Thank much information! normally cook home week I’ve mostly takeout, always bit worried. I’m pretty careful containers bags, it’s good know it’s unlikely infect food. International students, American students studying countries, expats, businessmen, Americans stranded abroad, foreigners family America, etc. flight Amman New York July packed. Again: anecdote data. never be. personal experience ant sized looked perspective data. I'm trying get op say words herd immunity... term ”brainwash” literally coined describe Chinese regime’s tactics towards populations POW Korean War.

Of course brainwashed people west, lots them. political ”extremists” religious fanatics, example. None government sponsored, though. radically conservative news outlet might brainwash followers, leaders society operates brainwash people. 

Now think it, diversity brainwashed people west actually good argument point originally trying make.

**Study Title:** Online study acceptance measures taken Covid-19 pandemic

**Study Description:** currently conducting worldwide survey regarding acceptance measures taken course COVID-19 pandemic. Participants asked judge appropriate consider range measures applied pandemic. also ask participants much pandemic/the measures affected life ask questions concerning social identity experience control things one’s life. **Everyone 18 years participate.**

**Study Link:** (ethical/legal):** study approved local ethics committee (#: 2777)

**End Date:** Open  keep screening deadly terrorists. Covid kill people. /s news... Water, wet. lot Europe bars open? That's exactly strict. That's claiming fired. Also please point cases number manipulation. like republicans claiming voter fraud mail ballots. Never producing concrete evidence. speculation. Maybe right proof flu years kills young old. 

The 1918 pandemic exception: killed (and quickly) young adults prime. reason simple: immune response strongest, immune response wound killing them.  However, Europe's beginning surge US trending downward. Also know ton people India apparently testing good. apps tell people Covid clusters enforce lockdowns better. much lower mortality rates.At least they’re everything power despite right wing government. I’m generally Republican Trump completely messed response country acting like buffoon . didn’t even know deadly virus could become ideological. understand virus toll economy people anybody despise glaring evidence call “flu”. We’re literally one scientifically advanced countries unparalleled medical technological resources along massive amounts wealth. could handle virus? Yes understand New Zealand could handle better it’s tiny obscure nation why’re much worse Europe handling TSA part DHS England really harsh lockdown March eased significantly past couple months attempt restart economy essentially stuck ""get fucked covid"" ""get completely fucked economy crashing"". Boris choosing latter thus parties 6 can't meet outside I'm still allowed crammed 500 people college. We’ve known since day 1. Ugh. Thanks sharing course will. /s mom lives America. forced. I'd go heartbeat (with adequate planning/protection, course - want infect friends). guess I'm saying America *seems* shitty moment, tons reasons people go borders open. student reportedly told officer week since positive test. officer asked student supposed quarantining, replied: “That’s I’m house.”

The student added “everyone staying house” also positive COVID-19, along residents across street, according news outlets.

Read here: officer infected wear mask talked inside. around october already lived years. apartment works releasers sign leases earlier people moving first time keep ""availability unit"" whatever. Unfortunately none ever done country.

The oligarchs like trap current system, keeps people indentured health insurance lives owed employer. leverage regular people. Thats never allowed change. Eddie Murphy Arsenio Hall? give one criticism China? “a bit longer” mean? probably won’t widely available vaccine summer next year. barely halfway through. People understand wearing masks distancing perfect.

You still everything right get covid. Kinda telling though compare worst countries world order look bad. think question deaths *at moment*. fine. parents must proud. maybe taking virus seriously either. also wish people paid attention beyond UBI platform, cause everything else listed also policy for. Ah well, I'm happy hes gaining traction. Better never I've taken 7 flights since covid broke out, caught it. total dumbass everything flying safe.  missed Hermain Cain. Yea wouldn’t get right haha. last like 4-5 years something though difference reasonable certainty exact certainty. likely one intimate likely window arrival virus US based knowledge fact. Yeah China's government pretty shit lot depends locality respect outbreak.  places outbreak control, know indoor events spread virus effectively temporarily closing indoor dining tool toolset.  get point things control, open measured way, actually measure results taking next step. Given statistical risk level (with age, gender, health stats etc...) getting vaccine Covid-19 arguably dangerous actually contracting disease itself.

I’m type person doesn’t even get flu shots. get vaccine something incredibly unlikely ever harm me? Pretty sure cause there's one screen. Oh god, sounds exactly like kind plan Trump would get behind.

More people = less % Infected! LOOK GREAT WE'RE DOING! Sorry bro you’ll need fatality rate that.
This shite gone soon enough  he? surely would saved lives.  credible reporting based social media posts? lots posts social media everyday, pick choose, suit narrative. right fucking article.

Death rates: 
60 older - 1.7%. 
40-59 - .12% 
Under 40 - .01%. started saying April schools would next nursing homes spread wise. Schools still can't control lice outbreak, yes let's send kids, teachers, aides, etc back school without proper precautions. know effect Covid-19 have. finding asymptomatic carriers showing damage months.

My girlfriend put daughter back school Cape Coral FL I'm 100% it. Masks mandated nothing else really changed, desks 6 ft apart, hallways packed, school sports teams clubs. Yes let's shut everything March couple cases fully exploded we'll send kids back see happens. I'm frustrated!!! Class 2024 gonna go worst ever Maine wedding cause 147 cases Covid-19? wedding lot less people nationwide protests. honestly believe protests caused zero cases Covid-19? Look cases Covid-19 Sonoma County CA protests look month later. cases exploded. think number going change things? 2021is going another great year. City bus drivers high-risk. done protect them, apart mandating masks — putting drivers behind bullet-proof screens protect criminally-stupid anti-maskers assault even kill bus drivers, happened one France? 

Maybe need nationwide strike, too.  far, new upturn infections has [not surge deaths, small fraction levels March April, pandemic tore Europe’s nursing homes. Many new patients younger healthier, testing expanded vastly -- turning asymptomatic infections previously went undetected -- treatment improved.

Why dont articles talking US ever acknowledge rather 100% doom gloom? 7-day death averages July/August never came CLOSE averages April despite fact new case average double April. sounds really bad, every time see news article covid death, click see photo. I’m looking smoked previous health problems. 

I’m looking see they’re obese. work covid hospital see every week. 80 year old Alzheimer’s patient fine, obese guy 40s ICU doesn’t look good.  73 wild. Past full retirement age, get love jobs, GTFO workforce. crazy took exactly one every age group teaches. Damn logistics.

Would happen know citizen UK could fly Asia fly Asia US? Stopping cases better stopping cases. really meant people fly get there. Disney seems fairly good job keeping spread virus down. Flying right seems like it'd lot higher risk outdoor park limited capacity. Dr. Li Wenliang street happening? hilarity US politicians trapping propaganda name US street CCP member. one many issues people potentially saddle rest lives. ironic US intelligence know second week November China first case. idea happened America. Err yeah?

This sub restricted US guys still debating even real reason. 50cent army full force today  difference. constant regards obesity. expect true number deaths currently like 300,000 here's why. Right tracking actual cases covid. flu deaths tracked estimates fact. actual flu numbers real time always lower eventual estimates conducted later. Covid, estimates challenging accurate actual numbers today. reason? lot people die flu without diagnosis. natural annual death rate population easy track time. spike death rate, likely due flu. number always higher earlier number tracked real time people get missed. almost certainly happen covid too. likely many deaths covid attributed covid.

A current real world example Sturgis motorcycle rally. earlier actual counts number 300 transmissions one death. statistical analysis, accurate number closer 250,000 transmissions due rally. calling super spreader event. 

So conclusion, expect real number American deaths due covid closer 300,000 currently. unless radical change leadership early successful vaccine, would surprised eventual death rate top 1 million Americans end 2021. know final tally later 2022, however. may want bot remind two years see correct. holidays? far holidays seem become another super spreader event  CLOSED CHINA BOARDER EVERYONE banned Winnie Pooh, get fuck outta lol de Blasio list?

No one said ""complete safety"" possible (or even goal). 

But things clearly risky reasonable person consider them.

Eating fucking restaurant clearly one those. Lol raised alarms? like we’ve aware disease since last year. sickening, poor school staff’s children. Maybe USA ask Chinese intelligence information. like 8 weeks, would know, I’m teacher. United States 21,000 cases reported today. USA population 328m. percent people getting infected 0.0064%.

Maybe actually working mayor biggest town instead shooting down.


She cares image running least cabinet position. there's ""lockdown"" mean everything used open still open mean people socially distancing. Seems like bad strategy. increases burden US nations test anyone US. Maybe spite biden wins? Come die US. Trump trying kickstart health care? Well, outdoor dining (spaced way fuck out) possibly reasonable. What, expect Swedes sit quiet corner answer criticism all? I've never heard anyone claim Sweden done everything right. situation looking lot better lately celebrating progress equal turning shit gold, it? say instead? everything shit time everything wrong? think criticism justified isn't. argue think right? See, learned opposite thing actually. actually positively function improve way less social interaction used get. actually exercise regularly, eat better, overall happier around less people. miss going pool movies dining don’t miss pressure hanging “friends”. dating part would suck though, luckily already plus one life. control group Pfizer vaccine another vaccine salt water (or similar)? northern state, would mind terribly sort scootch border bit join ya? common people resilient disease? I'm sure something else recently came something hit hard. Dizziness, headaches, strep throat, muscle weakness fatigue head toe, yet got fully better 2 days. Mom insisted covid get checked stick around long enough even bother I'm Az, I've given hope right thing happen. restaurant manager, put risk keep job. state shut us down, unemployment option.

The demographics website changed. longer figuring things together sharing credible information. first post meme get upvotes ""witty"" comment. making name now. Back then, random fuck names still anonymous-lite. tripfag deluxe.

Now people fanning hard attention advertise like social media website. look u/SrGrafo . happened users like u/unidan ? Mostly selfless individual always gave (for part) reliable information, in-depth. what, ended bit fucked up. isn't? least shared good, credible knowledge.

Now cookie cutter possible hivemind even attempting original. Circlejerking thing, day day out.

Old reddit gone, might well move on. website kids ""normies"" now. Make sure go inside air conditioned spaces troll. Ignoring everything wrote microanalyzng video outright dismisses masks, people belived consequences them.

Keep supporting hole virologists gain function. Oh look...the horse barn already...better close door.

The article doesn’t say returned in-person teaching.

This junk news. hate living America especially Texas. feel like I’m one follows guidelines protect COVID. suffering COVID becoming international laughing stock I’m forced work ass 8-5, 5 days week state growing cases every day. 

I don’t know terrible grandmother law died (not coronavirus) assisted living center. life fraught peril, escaped holocaust, learned new language new country, forgotten times proposed to, zest life never faltered. 

Last year went hot air balloon, love classical music took tanglewood music mountain regularly summers. Due covid last many months life really boring, starved social contact though, relentlessly positive way, put brave face things, worse old most.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* * Sweden failed protecting elderly care homes beginning resulted thousands deaths. question it. Swedish example sure isn’t success, wouldn’t say it’s failure either. Right it’s pretty successful, time eventually tell. 

* However, herd immunity strategy. I’m bit blown away hear editor-in-chief Medical Journal Australia getting wrong. 

* understand Australian living Sweden guy upset advice go hospital diagnosed COVID19. still don’t understand good would done him. long cope home, surely must much better stay risk infecting people hospital. all, cure could administered. Help here, understanding?

* understand non Swedes don’t understand recommendations work well legislative restrictions forced lockdowns here. It’s cultural thing. please, let’s look aggregated behaviour. It’s thing matters. 

* article seems another attempt influence Australian domestic audience relax governments measures. Using Sweden example becoming bit tiring.

* Masks... Don’t get us started... young (can't recall Grade 1 2) teacher school died school year. pretty traumatic class kids time, think point needing lot counseling. class think kind felt like going new school year get new teacher anyway.

Of course, might different time suspicions might bear blame teacher's death. Bold assume i'm process that. can't lose weight 5 seconds, also healthy drop weight rapid pace. I'm 18 pounds down, 100 pounds ""normal weight"", 75 pounds considered ""overweight"".

Doesn't change fear.  lol ""can't worse us come in!"" definitely worth publicizing. saw news today already knew trump wasn’t amazing solidified he’s bad imo. least employees put risk meal. say true, could say thing causes death.

Cancer, obesity, car accidents, murder. think makes fraud. paid that, like do. anti-healthcare anti-elderly. anti-Communism, escaped starvation, poverty, de-humanization USSR. Yep, back March/April many cases traced back people coming home Florida Disney World lol. I'll first line. Fuck it. I'm tired shit. saying two completely different (but probably equally true things). control right now? Yeah, probably. severely undercount cases deaths? Yeah, probably. Well kind shut since places preventing us going there. Trump can't control that. Maybe (not all) take kind good news opportunity stop giving shit?

I dont think facts ignored people react them. Colleges schools reopened past 2 weeks so. Require someone needs medical attention. too! get flu shot every year years get flu anyways. sucks whole lot wearing mask.

I hope whole pandemic save many lives flu respiratory illnesses next several years. way we'll keep social distancing, normalizing mask use, making people mindful going public sick, getting people habit frequent hand washing could make difference. least COVID, obese person hypertension likely die normal weight person hypertension, else keep in, keep others Facts don’t feelings. It’s pathetic won’t even accept another country could problems. It’s nonstop US bashing idea China reopened fully. China's gov't stranglehold news internet access. really idea come conclusions. think cognitive dissonance word here? Orange County reopen indoor settings, gyms theaters?

To think OC mocked others, beach protests one fastest infection rates state, yet they're first high risk list. Yeah doctors Wuhan ran hospitals closest Wet Market know December. 

Which means intelligence somehow picked chatter sources knew docs frontlines treat patients? Like happen?

This like China finding virus NYC December even local doctors realized unknown contagion spreading. 

They would like source inside first hospital found first case alerted national health system China. takes one positive person closed space together 10 minutes others get it.  Yeah like seatbelts! Wait...they allowing fans NFL games???? Thanks info. There's much keep on, I'm falling behind. takes village! Ok except well documented obese massively risk. Bury head sand like, obesity puts massive strain body, isn’t ‘fat shaming’ it’s telling people fucking look die. Stop trying compare US Europe. Europe actually managed flatten curve reopening schools even first place. 

America nowhere even near enough still reopened schools US still cases per capita daily basis.

Emphasis per capita way try use bigger population bullshit excuse. evidence tho Nice see things getting back something resembles normal. Hopefully works out. Yeah, think jobs imminent danger automated. like lots farming mechanized. single GPS enabled combine today work took dozens hundred years ago. simply technology harvest grapes strawberries yet.

Is possible iRobot future? Sure. But, point, decades away thing. think we'll see lifetimes. pay pre-check, rectal temperature home... great makes sense, measures covid much effective flu way less contagious. thing suck flu deaths people wills start yelling covid deaths secret flu deaths make seem worse.... México? 300,000,000 turns first case wasn’t even TM it’s moot.

Yeah, going edit comment, think regardless stand Still waiting someone explain China hid numbers 5 month supposedly indication mass infection mass lockdown. follow US’s trajectory China something like 50 million infected 2 million dead It’s also important note G614 strain virus (the one prevalent today) mutation much contagious original strain. well could spreading globally, much lower rate, throughout end 2019. school district reopening email admits know they're red zone. Current positivity rate county 12%, 2.5x want CDC standards reopen.

As long idiotic decisions keep made, going get worse. US Farmer workers received award working pandemic = totally relevant 

 top infectious disease expert recieved award managing COVID19 pandemic nation 1.4 billion = nothing coronavirus 

The hypocrisy xenophobia Huh? get Lisinopril without insurance like $4 could said America covered fucked world Actually thread making pretty easy, I’m blocking everyone making obviously incendiary, ignorant comments. whole family got super sick february. coughing, exhaustion, nausea. sister tested negative flu figured we’d ride out. 

took like 3 weeks feel normal. scares me. Back back years exhausting crap? power hands longer feel scared really depends sub-population virus reaching initial transmission stage. ppl getting infected primarily younger healthy see pneumonia-like symptoms clinics ER's. Remember public health authorities took notice found foothold Washington nursing home at-risk residents.  That's goalpost. Whether China something currently control little many people died before. provide link see base premise on... reports city council meeting Uni reps asked town pass ordinance groups larger 10. city didn’t think need pass legislation control student behavior campus.

How schools like Northeastern Boston then? know patroling off-campus housing break parties charge students breaking pandemic pledge.

Why schools Boston elsewhere town? can’t school rely social media posts off-campus parties gatherings frats sororities suspend students (and Greek houses)?

This school putting municipality. missing? course 'staying home forever' solution COVID become endemic

And yet, everyone seems indirectly suggesting. I’m sure CoVid Kim Iowa would willing see them... /s far school outbreaks mainly South. 

Nice see change pace? China's numbers may may true they're almost sure lot better US. They've pretty much reopened fully without signs huge outbreaks afterward, indicates virus pretty good control now. Also, judging locked Wuhan think would reopen actually still lot community spread going around. Someone else mentioned international students let in, US also letting US citizens green card holders. came back US EU June US citizen (I working past year) said CDC recommended quarantining 2 weeks took phone number personal information case someone else plane tested positive. Otherwise obligation quarantine. 

There's definitely lot US could like actual covid screening, given level viral spread already amount resources we'd need mobilize able quarantine travelers returning US, think many state federal governments seriously interested right now. ""know"" people press talks, salesman. Funny enough, high blood pressure adjusted age, sex, weight factor LOWER  inside much u wear fucking masks

Ah yes, simple.

You cannot completely shut society year.

People keep telling want lockdown 'forever', time something reopens, qualms celebrating closing playing 'I told so' card. Food important.

Don't drink calories. Eat high protein high fiber foods. Hungry? Eat veggies fruit. little fat/ protein. 

Eat smaller plates bowls

Don't give everything. buy little junk. Eat want. eat regular food rest week

Takes getting used really mostly habits. Gotta build inertia thought gave clear instructions reduce testing. concerned SD following instructions. adds perfectly, along numbers rest Asia, simply change initial conditions wherby China orgin simply acted far earlier outbreak.

But cant ever think thoughts works Already happening. mother-in-law 31 2nd graders room meant maybe 20... sure teachers quit what. matter time virus running rampant district teachers and/or staff dying. deliberately misrepresenting findings. cough, headache, fatigued 3 4 months straight, see doctor. Well, sensible enough. Masks mean getting lives back. knew like 2 mo. ago. love news organizations feel purposefully left out. I'd bet even worse 70. Keeping elderly safe one greatest mantras. entire affair (COVID19) ... Saddening. they're locking widely known politics rule, one things makes place bearable read.

No one discusses coronavirus posts, entire purpose subreddit. People want cry big bad orange guy, like rest reddit.

Lemme tell ya, really puts damper trying read discussion forum seeing 99% discussion much trump sucks instead topic supposed about. Well legal apparatus shutdowns lies states. imperative states provide means people locked earning wage. Looking Federal government absolutely absurd. Next month two, Iowa’s teacher deaths going come list. predict make numbers worse, much worse.

Mandatory person + mask mandate + obese population = disaster still understand we're arguing epidemiological statistics little bearing realities states &amp; hospital systems facing. like Covid19 100 times less contagious first thought. Given past Surge sunbelt states summer understand quickly case numbers positivity accelerates, importantly surges affect hospital bed &amp; ICU occupancy. mind Surge bad 191k+ death toll rounding error given population size, can't even conversation different value human life. mean sentinels? Instead half assed stay home orders reopened quickly, making everyone sick destroying many people’s businesses &amp; people’s livelihoods time.

The lockdowns helped, CDC take time make things better Trump muzzled them. flu present start lockdown also affected transmission capabilities [level 3 Infection control measures work target pathogen - transmit/transfer same/similar manner. 

Also population mindful touching face, covering sneezes/coughs, washing hands etc. 

International passenger arrivals drastically well. NZ 80% population count passenger arrivals recent normal years. ...  

* Feb 2020 - 375,000 arrivals 
* Mar 2020 - 175,000 arrivals 
 * [19 Mar border closed anyone citizens permanent 
 * [Mandatory enforced 14 day quarantine since perhaps mid May - people ignoring instruction self isolate 14

Here's graph last 5 years tradingeconomics:  become disillusioned country day passes...

I feel way many fellow countrymen. wary waiting years testing like drug? responded stating acts way viruses viruses make sick make sick. Brilliant insight Dr. fact don’t understand would *the law* scientific *ethical standards* purposefully infect human beings SARS-CoV-2 virus see happens, tells everything need know “scientific” claims. Excuses, excuses. know. teachers get paid enough put lives line. job markets get pay bills keep healthy? really tough spot in. know can't continue virtual teaching. 

The country could use empty schools homeless shelters. set Covid hospitals keep Covid victims established hospitals try keep even isolated. 

It's senseless. bunch, nothing get better unless Biden office.  [Real time video methodology preventing IND one first (if first) airports designed built 9/11. imagine built advancements screening tech. bad flu going around restaurant used work around late December January. Everyone getting sick bad. 

No one massive health implications tho.  lol, actually believe ""i always want play down"" US goverment idea cases America?

Not know virus America, knowledge Americas outbreak reason knew look China last November. Oh around tail end smoking planes kid partake. However one fist memories walking mall mom turned go store smacked eye lit cigarette. denies day that's something forget. different world respects, much others. Different states(and cases cities) different levels seriousness,for example home state (Kerala) people still aware cautious enough wear mask religously santizer(except couple of-course ).Meanwhile work state (Karnataka),from heard people completely stopped caring even wearing masks nowadays(Bangalore one worst offenders) literally everything opening there,I idea expect get back,it's like state government completely given up(if even cared anything numbers first place).

And honest social distancing pipe dream majority India,so like blame people much either. girl likes girls? Lmao 

Im kidding I'm taken, try tinder. That's honestly would single 😂 realise living costs probably much higher US, job protection horrible health care costs, even insured?! probably still much better live. one wants state headlines, fat likely die COVID! Start healthy today protect yourself! school lost 10 teachers summer, many older staff retired early, one schools lucky small enough enough resources properly. totally agree would solve issue maybe short term. cost product would soar probably. Also probably short list jobs automated sooner rather later. Probably soon cost effective. VR bars, hearing this. Finally use $600 VR headset son buy plays one game on. Fair enough, we're international disease pariahs. Ding ding ding Ok get old, problem solved. comparing US India, US already lost. Hold up, know someone named “the devil” feel need advocate him? Brilliant move. Nothing bad possibly happen that.  quote Captain Malcolm Reynolds: 


 Nothing worse *monster thinks he's right God*. skipping FDAs normal process determining whether safe effective

Source skipped parts process candidates? LOL, last laugh now? end goal here? keep schools open? likely won’t possible contact passengers flight may potentially exposed someone infected COVID-19.""

Every international visitor goes customs, government flight information. Past that, they're point willing contact tracing, *why say flew?* 

""Oh entered country couple days ago, flight on?"" ""I'll give information that!""


Seriously, name arbitrary list help? think people fly anonymously US? Every flight I've ever record. wait till covid over? obesity numbers drop, covid deaths drop it. Ironically paranoid getting corona symptom well girl fire! makes fake milk powder too. Daigo travel overseas steal supplies powdered milk countries sell profit back china. China can't trusted produce safe vaccine. Probably signed away legal rights beforehand too. two kinds people - people trying scratch microchips skin sheeple like mind-controlled right microchips. Okay anti-vax anti-science, driven political bias.

Stop lying, recognize mirror looking into. capitalist company would risk billions dollars manufacturing, labor, production Trump might tweet something mean. 


When strangers express something incredibly naive seem false propaganda makes wonder victim take rosey glasses. American would never think ""Florida State"" meant ""the state Florida."" I've heard terms thousand times know refer every time. Partially true, kicked spring doctors figured treat testing got lot better quickly containment outbreaks, Europe's death rate dramatically lower first time. I’m guessing they’re experiencing US did. next weeks interesting clearly knowledge lol

Italian researchers among best world, go abroad enough funding Italy stay create pretty good science ones abroad highly regarded occupy high level positions. sign legal waiver?  school district received notice yesterday despite code red despite promise students school code red, *the district going transition sending kids person*. 
 
What actual fuck? 15 spread virus exponentially.  coronavirus may reached ~~Los Angeles~~ China even China announced outbreak Oh man, looking dashboard pretty clear things rapidly getting hand. Positivity surveillance tests going 2.35 5.3 8.03 subsequent weeks bad.
That means week they’ll probably looking 11-12ish% positive unless something changes. don’t seem increasing surveillance testing. 450 day, voluntary, population 50,000 basically worthless. like 25x number. 

The fact don’t release positivity rate diagnostic tests bad.

The think testing worse seems. Completely voluntary testing means probably already getting taking seriously safe. Coupled fact aren’t even getting close goal 450 testa day. highest weekly average 379 test per day. stated goal test 1/2 campus thanksgiving weekly least. Absurd. TIL people still traveling US....

The know! Wearing mask means risk rather limited I’d quarantine return anyway.  hope you’re actually Doctor. yikes. giving money pay bills shut down

Wasn't entire problem states money, federal government giving any? Good luck flu season then. Everything perfect accurate thank response. I'll likely recycle future.

""Complete Phase 3"" goal. ""Clear efficacy"" goal. scientifically established, we're races, Phase 3 continue measure longer-term data stop death sickness. need. everything control. Daily cases significantly lower, positivity rate. believe China virus control *now*, isn’t endorsement China’s record keeping.

In response deleted reply, “China lying then” “China lying now” true. It’s mutually exclusive. You’ll notice it’s political it’s muricah specifically one party. green ones? apple ones lime ones? dont know. doctor told us likely it. Wow understand that. Obviously certain jobs disappearing people jobs need new ones. regions (particularly rural semi-rural areas) suffer industries rely (like trucking) disappear. people want make necessary changes (for number reasons).

What understand one hand believe jobs unskilled people need UBI prevent people starving, million immigrants year, many developing world even basic English skills, mention specialized skills, come US able find gainful employment.

That literally make sense.

And yeah, maybe picture paint one day reality, point we're imagining path. even started walking it. Hey man that’s feel respect it. thought first comment fair that’s clarified saying relation coronavirus. 

If think teachers subject coronavirus current teaching conditions even risk profession isn’t dangerous respect too. Honestly hope you’re right. think you’re wrong case people needlessly put risk.

It’s shaming it’s true. fat country. countries better aren’t lazy fat slobs. Sometimes it’s ok take little self responsibility.

Yes, I'm referring current case count rate, relevant whether currently safe travel to/from given country list.  LOT people Dallas. start fire? social security? US we're talking here... 'cause remember, social systems set citizens EVIL COMMUNIST TRAPS, know? Don’t antibodies generally wear months tho? would mean ramp testing get lower % data. know Trump feels testing. sleep beds burning? Check [this I'd paste got removed automod. ""One aspect screening travelers provide contact information, used perform contact tracing infections.

Everywhere followed patterns exponential growth. Anytime cases fell, happened slowly steadily period several months.

Once White House got involved data stopped making sense. Even though returned responsibility CDC, it’s obvious recommendations corrupt compromised well. I’ve stopped changing behavior response changing numbers. entered quarantine March never came back out. I’ve seen two friends since began I’m unemployment hardly ever go shopping. go I’m wearing N95. asked anything yet. think confused again. true. live north OC everyone seems pretty considerate masking. know.

Also, light 25% tip!! I'm sorry, that's Reddit especially sub works. say naive edgy shit little basis reality collect updoots idiots, cementing idea angry hot takes everything ""smart."" So, think university keep money educate anybody it? total death rate including ages seems high, high percentage old people concentrated old care home. least people required wear masks bathrooms, minutes time. I’m much concerned sitting mask-less feet away people hour more. ""...and we'll plowing own!"" Fingers crossed continues, although deaths seem lag cases 5 6 weeks, (looks like cases start peaking til late July)   doesn't.

Just wanted add RCV way done *lot* reading topic paranoid this, I'll try lay simply possible.

According numerous studies done this, currently zero evidence covid infect ingestion. lipids surrounding RNA would destroyed upon ingestion, unlike certain kinds viruses, stomach hostile environment covid.

However, say can't happen. Absence evidence mean evidence absence. anything conclusively say beyond shadow doubt can't get covid eating it, data research topic point points happening.

Basically, would very, hard covid infect swallowing it. SARS-CoV-2 infect parts body replicated lungs, accesses nasal passages mucus membranes face, including eyes. 

Even swallow food SARS-CoV-2 it, extremely unlikely able enter lungs  Well, 6 month headstart rest world surprising would frontrunner. know whole thing started China right. sure think might offending it, probably one person doubt he's Reddit.

Those experiments funded part Fauci US National Institute Health. Considering found Trump lied American people severity virus it’s time start protecting everyone around us gym since March well, bought Switch Ring Fit Adventure managed motivate least kind exercise couple months.

In past months gyms high risk environment causing infection clusters, made - fact really heard outbreaks specifically linked gyms. 

Here, masks mandatory staff, 50% equipment closed total people simultaneously working lowered.

 Germany currently 16k active cases nationwide, feel kind safe, still going gym... crack hear people think controlled.... delayed... thats it. 

You realize controlled pretty damn well lot places developing nations like US right? actually helping immunity. real.  like quote article time doesn’t work. moment, days last months. Afterwards, hindsight, without markers track flow, months feel like they’ve lasted days. multiple countries involved, make sense suspect chinese vaccine data trustworthy. Deep breaths. Part reason 30 somethings die get individual news stories still rare someone 30s die this, regardless weight. 5,000 people US 25 44 died COVID. think number 35 something like 2,000. That's 6 million diagnosed cases knowledge we've missed ton cases never diagnosed - people think high 20 million people COVID. Something like 40% Americans 25 44 age range qualify obese. certainly correlated worse results COVID clear still unlikely die get it, statistically. mean take seriously, treat like preexisting conditions, try lose weight, maybe help sleep night. 

It's pretty clear COVID deaths bit roll dice. Yes, preexisting conditions make vulnerable, also seems like genetics, environment, access quality Healthcare also huge factors. go eyes too, right? Right?! thought - like raising alarm part, alarm fkn raised months ago ffs Yeah, think thought makes americans go ""under 18 year olds children"". virus care emotional maturity relevant lots people think children (children teens) immune lot policy stupidly based misconception.

So yes, study would relevant meant children said children.

Stupid fucks. Continue trying find hope China definitely uppity Hong Kongers Taiwanese.

FDA approved CDC tested 100% filtration. sharing mask journey since can't find N95 anywhere :/ large scale phase three accepting consequences

Tesla phase 3 testing autopilot, yet everyone perfectly fine that. first impressions stick and, since many stupid and/or gullible people country 

... stuck you! mean antibody studies shown lot population got covid... Yes. countries gave multiple stimulus checks. Government instead bailed big businesses gave massive tax breaks. Billionaires shown ridiculous growth pandemic, cases doubled net worth, $2000 month get everybody stay home, actual lockdown would saved hundreds thousands lives NJ strong Union lots districts hybrid. Governor want bad guy scapegoated teachers. get that. people going magically change minds point. Repeating nauseam going obnoxious everyone. already honest. Why? lots landlords also jacked rent prices way last months Multiple Sclerosis moron That's liability works. cool fun unique March April

That shit fun Even though there’s difference droplets truly airborne disease think point it’s semantics. It’s proven airborne *enough*. doesn’t R0 say, measles, two people without masks talking six feet apart still risk infecting other. Also I’m remembering correctly certain circumstances virus seem able circulate fine air (ex. Restaurants circulating air/vents) know labs able find virus state would considered airborne afaik rna damaged/they weren’t able prove still “live”. someone details correct but

Tl;dr airborne virus ever? No. it’s close enough point it’s pedantic treat is. India already manufacturers world's 60% vaccines, point really makes sense. means students general population similar results ms? really can't stop pandemic, death toll honestly inevitable unless there's miracle solution rapid vaccine development. Find something do. Take new solo hobby. Try reading, gaming, crafting things (woodwork, sewing, etc), whatever.

Getting tired good excuse ignore responsibility people keep part. Nobody said pandemic would easy, fun, short, lying. Sure, said that, also pulling numbers straight ass. People idiots appreciate it. easy say teachers strike many states would career ending resulting loss health insurance income. lot teachers would rather take gamble covid. people country strike support teachers. way  else supposed sell video workout accessories 2017??

I mean, phrasing 2017 tiny bit different, ""Stay Home, Save Money Fitness Program"".... extremely similar current ""Stay Home, Avoid COVID19, Save Money Fitness Program....""

She still wants stay home give money, y'all. message still same. Thank you. know eye drops! Also, 73, elderly rekative! Sinovac vaccine candidate properly tested, second candidate reach (international) Phase 3 trials Oxford's. might thinking dodgy Russian one instead. Goddamn came back lot downvotes talking MMT lol WLTX blocked internationally ... Perhaps someone could copy article text comments. Crucial, would say Isn’t Victoria experiencing heavy pushback long people locked for? Australian family friends think state gone overboard. Good point antibody correlation. People severe illness immune system working hard beat it, proof ADE. could evidence antibodies helping enough.

This paper discusses S-protein pretty comprehensively background material. reason want lot innocent people die. executed decision. basically playing game Go us. Dump board upside nuke them.  Great anlaogy. problem least ants trying. mask isnt muzzle, all.  keep pointing let herd immunity set in...we're going lots deaths. 

Some basic numbers. 300 million population US. Let's assume there's death rate HALF 1 percent. That's 1.5 Million people dead. assume death rate half still 750k! 

Idk real infection numbers (and likely one does) we're approaching 200k deaths. That's economy great. ""friends"" probably never treated better happy him. He's king world. Yes risk higher hypertension Russia large scale phase three

Woah. I’m thinking isn’t coincidence. didn’t know anything time Yep! Got billed thousands doctor even remember popped head look daughter. even walk room talk us. Yes, this. Hospitals even check see okay doctor specialist see insurance/money pay it.

They absolutely give two farts, get bill tens thousands. *And care.*  soon got US redcaps came droves. 

ffs could well history books call 'brownshirts' anyone seen information regarding distribution vaccine infants children? Haven’t seen clinical trials done anyone 18 (for ethical reasons, imagine), I’m trying gauge offered children anytime near future. 4 month old daughter hasn’t met family yet, live across country. middle nowhere mean less hour major US city sure.. sarcastic evidence masks reduce potential spread disease; however, United States shortage disposable surgical masks, ask cover nose mouth bandana, scarf, homemade face covering.”

My first experience high school friend sister's nurse. posted FB literally telling NURSES TREATING COVID PATIENTS this. thread blew idiot woman, NURSE, talking Trump could ""it's state's job handle it!""

Like, lady. California governor would expected deal measles outbreak Jenny McCarthy's kids school mean he, governor, responsible handling level shit. country once: president take care it.

That's found really going on: China hoarding everything, states outbidding getting priority based whether Trump liked (I think low-key Republican governor benefited all... sidenote, go Charlie Baker! great job this) Trump enact Wartime Production Act make PPE, CUT FUCKING PANDEMIC TEAM make money pay monument himself, literally boxes boxes masks sitting garages...

So yeah, let go N95 guilt. point, trying ""stop spread"" flatten curve wearing N95 masks? theory available they'll ask us this. colder weather (up least) people might like idea. Wait minute, think even decided yet airborne. thought still droplet spread. Thats different airborne. know trump said tape dont think knew talking regards point. damning said knew severe easily spread. think airborne error. wrong? done studies people high blood pressure normal weight. Even yiu right (which not) people would go back normal next year anyway, getting use it. Guess *you* bot. would want lot, LOT, innocent people, die? someone high hypertension control medication. still major risk severe illness covid 19?  think they're inoculations though since inject foreign body illicit immune response. small group suffered complication millions received shot. 

For high risk groups, vaccine odds complication like that, would still worth due risk death COVID. Hence likely emergency approval expected end year.

For wider public wait phase 3 concludes likely anyway literally lied masks needed back march.

""Fauci: The masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks"" believe US constitutional issues border closures. Realistically beyond extreme suppression. don’t know US it’s clear it’s doing. Remember half people stupid average. average person need involved whole lot stupidity manifest itself. Yes read post, concrete evidence, use words like ""may"", "" estimated"".

Fact 0 studies show significant decrease infection rate. study, please link full studies I'm happy look it. tiered.

If tiered (aka ""graduated) tax, longer flat. Graduated taxes considered progressive, whereas flat taxes considered regressive tend hurt exclusively poor.

Taxes political nature. US one countries global tax system rather territorial one, agree tax law times unnecessarily complex (in fact, quite often so), often complexity merit micro macro level.

One perspective consider: Taxes way influence behavior. Taxes based pollution encourage companies reduce emissions. ""Sin"" taxes reduce individual consumption alcohol/cigarettes (though people argue effectiveness). ""Use"" taxes gasoline ensure people use roads ones paying taxes maintain them. ""Luxury"" taxes elite goods tax wealthy. Etc etc.

I saw touched briefly removing deductions. shown charitable giving increases charitable deduction increased (particularly estate taxes). There's lot complexity discuss, high level perspectives consider. homicide? Wtf anyone see coming? Like teachers quoting retiring early due concerns health? lawyers Florida offer free living wills teachers? teachers personally made sure wills date, case? district online. I've literally seen multiple doctors middle age run miles wearing masks restrict airflow whatsoever. Poor salmon trying chill still got covid

🐠 😢 Damn...I heard guy four strokes.. hopefully suffer much neuropathy. virus serious always going lasting impact far eventually goes away (remains seen). Polio left people paralyzed, measles/mumps leave men sterile....COVID 100% major longterm health implications. continue cost healthcare system billions trillions run studies, produce new medication, rehab physical therapy etc take care patients lifetime. mention idea heart lung failure point lives; think getting organ transplant hard now, wait ton COVID survivors need transplant around time future. RIVM says tho. point follow 1.5m social distancing rules, masks minimal effect reducing spread. seems correct given decline infections may june. done purely social distancing. Masks help 1.5m can't done, mask mandatory public transport.

But guess reddit hivemind accepts masks solution Teacher east coast happy home. Everything online including meeting, teaching, whatever else think of. hypertension caused sinus tachycardia. Fortunately, I'm cheap med treats both. Unfortunately, lost insurance can't find tachycardia first place. Maybe we're watching video, one saw he's uncomfortable. whole argument meant opposite came mouth? Fauci balls keeps real, I'm buying it. words use headliner Fauci, choose use word muzzled...

If knew anything China, realize title China mostly honorific, ""President life"" yet another spin Western media. true power position [General never defined term limit begin with.

There concerns Xi staying power longer expected, removal term limit presidential position surely one. I’m surprised didn’t get visa/pass revoked. benefit striking least risk getting virus could potentially *kill you*, give chronic breathing complications rest life.

At least strike keep health intact, switch careers necessary, move states. Name non-capitalist country think US model. Neither fuck taste/smell brain level.

Yes can. God people even look saying all? bunch angry white people assault rifles storm state capitals? said masks work early on. 

Also citing support argument. 

You played yourself. Congrats.  'Mask Mouth'... right?! :O 100% Teachers underlying problems go back school teach, stay home zoom up! Every teacher, think gonna make fine always option homeless 🤷‍♂️ international threads China Russia full easily refutable blatant copy-paste ""highly likely"" propaganda.

As (mostly Europe/US) threads - live there, know local situation, would post there, uninformed? want see data correlation cases MIS-C didn’t realize drop /s there. barbers hair dressers closed good length time 84 year old dad would able work like March end June maybe. forget exactly hair reopened even it’s limited capacity.
So hair dressers barbers choice work. couldn’t make ends meet unless picked driving instacart something like that. went work grocer likely wouldn’t enough like making hair stylist.

So closures could work couldn’t clearly regional. professions matter can’t done remotely. agree said besides production distribution vaccine. much funding resources thrown vaccine around world viable vaccine produced it’ll masses matter months. I'm lazy leave clutter around house. ""this many months in,"" huge problem six months enough sign serious. Stupid people think they're smart need stop f'n stupid. ~200k Americans died since March due COVID. Semantics mean shit. I'm voted criticizing Fauci, hold higher standard national leaders point I'm disappointed/expected more. great respect everything else he's done, including handling AIDS crisis.

But right, could've stockpiled respirators healthcare workers started using cloth masks sooner general public. 

I can't help think misguided lies way infantilizing American public contributed spread conspiracy theories, illness, death... level us.   still left slots phase III live, could obviously get placebo ... would least contribute.  Confusion dizziness among first symptoms it, that’s known common time. Even doctors often aren’t aware this. It’s good know mechanism though, it’s never severe cytokine storm period occur. case still relatively mild, never hospitalized shortness breath. never stop winning. whining. honestly, paper heart attack per se :) like Trump's taxes, right? got magic healing water want sell us, too? us immune Hey look, fine dog meme reddit account. cool! America worst they're even part Hey that's Dutch farmers too! Covid seems destroy organs. died complications arising covid, died covid. I've said elsewhere probably sub too.

Strike _everywhere_ including states prohibit it. enough critical mass, something would done, powers choice, unlike ATC strike 80s, enough military teachers (a la ATC) go around...

Why even attempting person schools vast majority places beyond me.

The schools shutdown step remote game. Band together. Partner Google. Partner Amazon, make PR stunt care make everyone feel good, _but least prepared_.

I understand wanting get back normal. Trust me, pandemic fatigue damage lost summer (and unemployment, etc) real.  soon safe effective vaccine available, sign up.

Then, somehow, way, need start addressing serious problems country bright light shined whole thing. surprised someone's playing hockey data Although get what's point, say Chinese government clearly demonstrated ability take criticism react reality objectively. Well, us. us feel like last survivors zombie apocalypse, surrounded brainless creatures. ah, kind observations always made - pretty much sort analysis. hear valid point.

usually, analysis accepted something set hypothesis accepted discarded based actual tests. 

still, ok warning. Oh yeah. Teachers quitting left right. lot districts scrambling left open positions. said, teachers make little can’t afford work switch careers suddenly, us feel deep obligation kids. It’s shitty place in. Yep, I’m Bio/Edu major. Definitely focused bio right now. seems Ohio they’re going “pray stay quiet approach”. genuinely believe “hope” think get season without spreading enough actually affects someone get tested. 

I doubt it’s explicitly stated, growing mantra “don’t fuck football”, fully expect believe football player gets it, gives another football player, brings home, gets mom slightly sick, passes grandma, actually gets test traces back football team, they’ll keep rolling. parents players vested interests don’t want kid miss reason team quarantine, he/she showing symptoms, well right? 

In seriousness, I’m concerned going blow schools faces month virus enough time work way Oh don’t trust Putin’s numbers throw window, numbers accurate ~150 deaths per day would acceptable. problem governments murder dissidents lie regularity — never trust numbers.

But “60% peak” doesn’t mean anything peak low, can’t fathom countries locked entire regions 50 cases. That’s sustainable. Sensitivity != accuracy

The test aren’t random 50% less sensitive. require higher viral load return positive result. aren’t diginostic test they’re infection control test. return positive results person high enough viral load infect people. Besides PCR tests use almost sensitive look RNA particles left you’re system stop becoming transmissible. could literally way pandemic hey people don’t understand shit. Missouri (and many states) it’s illegal teachers strike unions said they’re willing fight change that. teacher’s unions joke. Teachers also aren’t allowed give 2 weeks notice quit like jobs. contracts state would owe anywhere $3,000-$7,000 probably get teachers license revoked quit. Even giving notice doesn’t mean anything. school board okay pandemic teacher sub shortage won’t approve it. Less one week kids school family Covid. careful. person would still alive weren’t Covid-19, really fucking matter? Jesus taking account countries big gaps Excess Mortality Covid-registered deaths, numbers agree relatively well Sweden.  Plus, students regularly visit elderly relatives. "" sneezing guard, Sun Szu-Yen, 46, said: “You get it? get already!” She took passport bag added: “I China. Taiwan.” 

11 weeks short moron. started year I’m feeling disillusioned. goal decade. I’m and, what, gonna die maybe job? guess creative way shame people, nothing prevent spread, might even help since sneezing coughing elbow harder without it. Can’t expect anything China. Seems sub invaded pro-virus, anti-mask Karens. Stop spreading 5G level conspiracies. dangerous. This. Everyone trying pretend overweight isn’t huge health issue. get past COVID nation really start addressing elephant room. exactly pro-maskers ‘doing’ help? may explain many 2020's wackiest goings on, general sense ""craziness"". how? bit important fact gets glossed over:

 “DeMarinis became ill last month kids returned class”

Teachers catching virus community, classroom. don’t think closing school would prevented getting virus.

Go ahead downvote me, cowards. wanna, lol. president life! arent alone thinking. exactly well. Leaving behind gym culture one hardest parts personally. sucks realizing people around years hung profoundly broken selfish. 

But hey, that's self growth guess. read article, explain oxygen. due lung damage? red blood cells extremely low? unable make new red blood cells? April May, maybe. since fixed problem death curve looks awesome. excess deaths. accomplished without ever going lockdown. model rest world. teachers son’s school given option person remote. 40% chosen remote. large part reason fine keeping son home. point going English, math science teachers going zoom anyway. totally support teachers this. way suspicious? test much never before: 126k tests last week, positivity rate 1.2x %  
Unlike countries restirctions (except two hour travel limit) still place place summer. Sweden never lifted restrictions like Norway Denmark. Plenty people listen him. Look state US. Chinese government clearly demonstrated ability take criticism eh? think I've COVID last 10 years least. labor day like 50%  Zombie apocalypse go maybe go countries able provide multiple stimulus checks? New Zealand great resume life paid everybody stay home didn’t half ass lockdown “Scrub groceries isopropyl alcohol steel wool 10-15 minutes doomscrolling r/coronavirus...” masks don’t actually affect oxygen levels Fk deeply regret signing year long lease last year. essential service jobs would someone else. 

The real problem immigrants pushed vulnerable underpaided / exploited positions simultaneously scapegoated white nationalist country's problems Make sure gets platform. Get weekly 30min TV brief, outside government does. even subreddit? don’t exercise home. Running, jogging, hiking etc. outdoors. subreddit invaded anti-pandemic everything lately, really sucks see there. meant obesity, obviously already stolen medical supplies supposed ""allies"" before. par course. Exactly. even mention vitamin D? late night troll. Talk morning dont believe 100 % going take a, potentially rushed, vaccine South Korea, provide source cut crap. 

You're getting idiotic anti-vaxxers everywhere, actually matter numbers statisticians get Europe (you remember ""herd immunity""? need 100 % immune people!)  
The problem might people general favour vaccines, trust Coronavirus-vaccine, maybe unknown side-effects/risks; fear unreasonable. What!!! sanitize salmon. Oh wait, I'm poor afford salmon. NVM. unlikely die, nobody knows long-term effects anyone else may experience. new extensive study. 

Athletes particular risk cardiac problems overexertion may exacerbate asymptomatic ""mild"" COVID may cause imperceptible hazardous heart conditions. Many already pushing body limits without adding additional risk factors.

A college athlete also unique position rare skill extreme earning opportunity. COVID causes long-term damage, could end whatever future sport; many NFL-candidate athletes opting-out college season.

Frankly, believe colleges schools open in-person classes all, much less sports extra-curricular activities. know getting info large majority Americans wearing masks. traveled east coast count 1 hand number people saw without mask public. 70 cases becomes lot 70 cases; when, invariably someone *does* die consequence chain events, prosecuted then? people link gave earlier, responsible consequences actions, not, not? layers abstraction allow abandon responsibility despite *reason* people got infected later died. 

you deciding stop following chain infection arbitrary limit mean lives ended, means looking closely enough *want* look closely enough want look closely might come terms fact people making choices getting others killed perhaps something that. lot already knew quite while. lie video, done now?

No, even close. quote exact sentence, sentences, believe lie? I've watched video lie. 

He gives opinion time. disagree opinion make dishonest. 

There limited supply PPE enough masks everyone, choices made would effective. 

There numerous reasons makes sense allocate PPE medical professionals instead members general public. Medical staff exposed much higher viral payload, much longer periods time essential workers.

If limited amount fuel chose allocate fuel emergency service vehicles mean believe motor vehicles run without fuel, need fuel, fuel work vehicles. choice ensure fuel used gain maximum benefit. 

Making difficult call make dishonest. may advocated masks beginning supply issue. word “airborne” difficult define scientifically.

OK, said matter factly. dont think system really clogged Covid patients right now, it?

Where would say hospitals full right now?  many people try maintain distance shops. Buses idea since havent one 6 months. That's cook food. promised 200,000 day back April... hitting goal. They've also promised 500,000 end October. Let's wait see....

Honestly, say capacity 350,000 day using 200,000. Except people can't get tests, massive queues test stations people sent 200 miles test...

Never trust politician says, see do. Tell micron size mask micron size covid, seem expert field. Found bot!
Or possibly redcap. heard updating opinion based facts research??? Misdirected anger. pointed ignorant stupid people politicians put money health. he's waiting right time,

Which what, 400K dead? lives ended.. Exactly. work dictator independent better leaving. That's whataboutism. Whatoaboutism bringing something completely unrelated, e. g., armed conflicts Syria BLM riots. Telling people driving assist autopilot testing vaccine related fact safety human lives main concern. took asked again. refused, changed locations kick arrived original destination 2 hours later. tests Antigen (the Virus) able produce Positive test unless caught (very unlikely).

That's exactly happened... told masks bad idea would encourage people social distance.

I idea Fauci anything that... official word CDC one point. What's worse Indians even care anymore. Thanks media.  nobody died much that, sure. cousin roomate tested positive. said 5 friends test positive today whole building infested. said begged building management make masks mandatory, said signs elevators kids keep taking down. Management literally asked ""what think then? can't kick people lease agreement."" pandemic political event? exclude Oslo Viken (I mean Viken monstrous construct anyway like old Østfold fylke).

wanna revisit prediction? article Different vegetables food, fish transported, stored sold low-temperature environment

...implying foods safer constantly refrigerated temperatures.

It also evidence date viruses cause respiratory illnesses transmitted via food food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply food; need animal human host multiply

...so viruses directly transferred fish fishermen processors available infect you. I'd like know many viruses found fish versus infected person's sneeze droplets. heard people reporting COVID back 2019. heard anything last months? China magically got much better censoring information? Keeping classy Meal Team Six good one too. earth talking about? Fauci supported use masks long Trump did. Trump shunned masks mid-fucking-July. Depends point it, honestly... person decided compare mask mandates Nazi Germany (somewhat loosely end stuff) subreddit that's geared towards updating people pandemic... Know audience, guess? dont think so. least 50 people Right, reached herd immunity. know lol

And since educated you, know too. 同志我他妈的会普通话!

You idea talking about, considering Americans see anything covid day day lives, either. Seems like pretty big coincidence ""outer masks ok"" right massive protests left. I'm Covid denier, seems like massive hypocrisy. coughs chilled salmon? eats salmon raw?? essentially three ways covid-19 kill you, relate termed ""maladaptive immune response"". words, virus, body try counteract virus kills you. immune system sends incredible amounts cytokines body results changes lungs. one case, people cannot breath basically drowning fluids. second case, scar tissue develops prevents lungs functioning person suffocates. third case one various organs fail, kidney heart. also might cases people comorbidities body handle stress happening collapses heart attack problem.

That said, apart way reacts subject brought up, dislike Fauci. seems best I'll never problem anyone tells Trump STFU. Making mask pinch takes old tee shirt hairties/rubber bands. bandana. official stance masks Feb-April

""we've tried nothing work!"" Lockdowns/heavy restrictions put much dent anything. Sweden living proof. Thanks Lol China North Korea, millions foreign nationals thousand foreign journalists China. think plenty leaked footage people collapsing street, overwhelmed hospitals completely empty street back January, thing that's coming China huge parties, festivals crowded streets barely anyone wearing masks?

Maybye 1 20.. thats guess dont count people im walking 🙂 ""I'll never muzzled"", Fauci said adjusting mask. I'm excited anyplace going business, but, good time watch commercial treadmills smaller gyms keep going. 

I bought fantastic commercial treadmill back 2012 steal, I've tread replaced couple times deck replaced. Still runs perfectly. 

I recently bought another one happened upon $300 commercial grade monstrosity.. lol one I'll putting garage spouse unfortunately window time open treadmill usage. Picked window AC, need get one small bedroom TV's mounted there. 

The home use treadmills kind suck cost way much are.  Er what? trump cultists suddenly become pro-mask? Im saying Fauci lies cover trump’s ass somehow makes pro-trump? read?  mean it’s Florida. lose either way  Bingo. Schools screwing up. fair, difficult read poorly written comments. understand people might confused message. ALWAYS wear mask exercising. Hey, could spread flu stuff. I'm sure masks great oxygen intake exercising also. like giving birth pane glass Yes, Florida got hit much later pandemic advantage greater knowledge effective treatments, thus able adjust response result locking down.

Additionally, using cumulative totals, I'll point initial argument Michigan smaller state population wise younger population. fact less half size, approximately 6,700 deaths fact worse Florida even cumulatively.

Well travel international came back today. it’s work live There's always stuff going around. Especially middle flu season. satire guy. can’t tell that, life must hard Can't cake eat Anyone better Trump. Fucking anyone.  Imagine Bush said ""It is"" 9/11  great guest! I've wanting go back Rogan's podcast, nothing yet. However, find podcast called Osterholm Update. newest episode actually came today!  go live across one shutdown dorms. university barely done anything diminish cases, resorted solely blaming freshmen Greek life cover tracks. It’s super frustrating. I'm tired ""if young unlikely die COVID.""

People making statement usually trying convey perfectly ok live life normal, masks social distancing required.

And may completely true mathematical standpoint, assumes outcome contracting COVID binary: either die recover live normally.

The truth many outcomes between, many young people experience long-term impacts health, many still unknown.

So, I'll continue wearing mask going parties time information known threat minimized. Rice, beans, frozen broccoli relatively cheap. real reason there's surfacing Karens Miami University Ohio fyi. haven’t even hit end game yet. humidity drops dry winter air, that’s things highly likely get ugly. quickly.  said anything failure. Anyone two braincells see failures America had.

At time disingenuous fuck misrepresent risk young people directly studies like focus small slither cases. supports claim children ""super spreaders""? mention article, though. Since restrictions explains exploding early on? sub utter political driven shit many months Hm, problem ""under 40"" broad averaging ages 1-20 siginificantly less someone who's 39. Based chart saved back ourworldindata.org, someone 30-39 age group 0.11%-0.3% CFR depending country. Ages 0-19 basically 0%. [Here Spain (preprint) it.

Here's [another (also preprint).

And [article Yeah, even think disagree. trying probably failing say decision contain logic, simply cannot ignore economic political impacts. multiple data points, probably ones we'd prefer. Although I'd argue political impact ignored decisions made decent, thinking people. know that's always case.

I agree percent positive enough open anything indoors people congregate without masks extended periods time. things better bailing restaurants places impacted intrinsic nature virus (rather wrong place wrong time/wrong side things long without consequence i.e. - commercial real estate prices cities), we'd never consider opening anything fits likely place virus transmitted.

Likewise, surveying mask compliance additional metric, I'll bet half states still locked regardless percent positive.

The rest rant links vomit credible sources back up. feel scientific medical community held accountable certain pattern ego driven mistakes might fine we're arguing quantum physics theoretical scientific constructs lack suffucient proof describe exactly whats going on, ""not enough evidence"" mantra case means lives lost collectively bunch small things might ""only"" work 50 percent time. think one link last comment specifically addressed failures (also, Linsey Marr scientists like Twitter better resources than, say, televised news). 

Coronavirus one rare moments history science MUST evolve meet moment has. never happens without lot dogmatic adherence norms nobody even sure ""facts"" came from, people fringe turn right heavily criticized, sometimes dissenters even outright silenced. 

One thing say faith newspapers magazines primary sources cast wide net up-to-date information restored. Televised news, hand, awful updating public science virus changed. deaths nearly there. Italy 589, Sweden 578.

But yeah went lot better thought.

But fine: Sweden things. Don’t believe propaganda you’ve read. current success isn’t based “doing nothing”. details comment. That's point along. know, testing people somehow bad. What?? even make sense context. File ""n"", ""no shit dumbass"".

If guess, virus 0.125 microns n95 masks filter 0.3 microns paper looks like wouldnt help bother telling people use cloth masks n95 cant filter size virus. 

The major benefit everyone wearing masks arent letting split fly across room, ""purifying"" air breathe. found out, everyone (except president) started pushing wear masks/facial coverings. Edit:clarity expect wearing mask well 2021 maybe even 2022. could be? It'll Chinese vaccine protect ""these poor people"". acquaintance Facebook wedding planner she’s posting picture clients. You’d think couples would trying take precautions hearing stories no, can’t ruin social media pictures! Got look good gram. Exercise home would best. Cancel membership. Add gyms list things longer exist like planes concerts. half year, USA still denial phase. I'm afraid take while. 

Stay strong. Wow, almost like everyone's lot stress right reason. Lol talking about? look people riding train, sitting every second seat.

The subway operating 50% capacity minimize spread. miss sub pre-USA days. crazy China videos thought process too... time, dad said ""this NEW virus, know anything it!"" look find it's... uh... SARS? everyone talking buying masks?

I 13 made sense.

Between seeing pictures people countries wearing masks made really confused, hypochondriac anyway, told dad wearing masks on. Luckily N95s easily able buy several boxes since. reasons healthcare workers availability HOSPITALS, general market.

If Trump put pressure lie, given know much knew back then... deserves third impeachment that. Dude, fuck off. Healthy young people died continue die COVID-19. wrong impression own.

Then again, sound UK seem understand also need force quarantine tests positive, that's case waste time. bit odd, this. Guinea less 10,000 cases reporting 15 cases re-infection.

I'm thinking this, realizing problem hold Fauci way higher standard Trump. terms intelligence (because duh) terms personal morals ethics. knew completely lacking departments, looked Fauci governors throughout this. Andrew Cuomo made serious mistakes, given CDC advice time shortage everything hospitals, can't angry like many people are.

Despite ended up, I'll always remember Bush got us 9/11. would easy Trump compared that... fucking can't. Mass testing, lol, finally reached point admit China right yet another thing.

From lockdowns centralized quarantine mask mandate mass testing, western countries admitted China role model since day one they'd hole already, face, gota save face. ones making laws dont follow them. Lawmakers persuaded donors, donors financial interests. Even good intentioned elected officials persuaded donors, every politician persuaded point. system based heavily donor support inevitably destructive. brings us current day 1st world countries care citizens, except US money comes first, always!

yOuTubE!!@! got bridge sell ya think anytime summer next year. I'm COVID f'n serious train, I've looked found many reports (on places like /r/COVID19Positive) sexual disfunction post infection.

Now, maybe people talk it, takes time. perhaps could make impodent (or prone sick babies).....I dunno....but scouring social media figured I'd find concerned posts erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia, etc common.

There popular youtube guy w/ million subs (Bald &amp; Bankrupt?) COVID vid experienced suggested messed w/ man part. that's one handful found.

Also article posted Sept 1 media outlet ran w/ it.....so...I'm skeptical particular symptom. scientific process. knew masks worked lied public saying didn't. could honest worried mask supplies healthcare workers chose lie instead trust us. Well, trust them. Great public health strategy pandemic.  Wanna guess nationality mods?

Sigh, fact getting downvotes says everything. reddit. He's one respected disease experts country decades. quick Google search explain why. Australia fuck around. got cops running around actually enforcing curfew mask mandates. social distancing places business. 


There’s way shut attempt contain 7 current million infections. Hell California GOP leader suppose quarantine covid exposure went large indoor religious gathering mask less anyways.


Our current CDC issue guidelines mandates. CDC powers stripped away. United States really need reinforce Public Health Laws actually add teeth CDC again. Wanna guess nationality mods? “raises alarms” I’m assuming mean perpetual klaxon that’s gradually getting louder since middle 2016? Critical point. breaking doctor, specialist public health, invited people cured covid-19, respect barrier measures, recalled coranavirus immunizing disease. “ cured coronavirus, probability high re-infected 3 months. coronavirus immunizing disease, exceed 3 months. barrier measures respected, recontact disease. public official talking vaccine approved realized approved early COVID infection rates going much faster expected fall?

The vaccine trials can't finish record enough events. case, events mean trial participants catching COVID: need see lots people given sham vaccine get disease people given real vaccine get disease. 

So predictions trial finish based infection rates: higher infection rates = events recorded sooner = quicker completion.

Thus: anyone says think vaccine approved ahead schedule also saying think COVID rates going much higher projected. 

The vaccine around corner! ... hooray? downvoted? facts lived months back. prominent political public health leaders lied American public regard efficacy masks. everyone China wearing masks work? lied us. 

The health leaders lying almost worse politicians almost expect politicians lie, needed trusted nonpartisan science advisors got nothing. pump money in, start see inflation recoup taxes wealthy better Wakefield part 2 Lancet huh Lol fuck US dumpster fire everyone pro vaxx told vaccines never complications good time. point problems kind aparently antivaxx lol.

Laos? Maybe, tiny.

Myanmar? lol

Germany Canada success story apparently think are. teacher yes, would. Check mate, pleb. ""Fauci's comments echo of Surgeon General Jerome Adams March 2, said increased demand masks putting medical professionals risk.
A days earlier, tweeted masks ""not effective preventing"" COVID-19 general public, saying, ""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!"" later reversed advice.""

""Fauci explained early advice masks saying: ""The public-health community — many people saying — concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply.""

Saying stop buying masks work saying oh said save health workers lying people people still think today masks work it. I’m Texas Houston responsible high numbers. went city weeks ago (we live outside Harris county) it’s ridiculous. would never know pandemic. Patios full people- masks , yet weirdos riding bicycles street wearing masks latex gloves. even work?

It’s like bizarro world.

Edited testing: 
Testing rampant: drives every single weekend - free testing - without symptoms . doesn’t seem testing slowed here. 
I say dozens pop drive testing places. almost always empty workers sitting . rely brain critical thinking abilities protect ""fake news"" - social media overlords. Good lord. Great job! Dr Zhong Nanshan deserves lot mods sub think he's 'relevant' Dr responsible media? seem thing anymore. true.

Basically crack except you’re hungry tired I'd almost anything go ball game get warm beer cold hot dog point never choice save lives save economy. correct choice save lives time save economy. Surprisingly economy dependent people. doctor, think performing surgery without mask ethical safe? mean, bother wonder? need like sort proof thag doctors need? 

OK, back up. find quote saying ""PPE effective stopping covid19"" I'll completely agree you. would lie. 

But far tell never said that. statements seem always along lines ""hospitals medial workers need (truth) there's shortages happening (truth) recommend masks public""* ... lie there? 

Not recommending masks public hospitals lie, weighing options making recommendation thinks best. 

I feel like want take change advice lie looking really said. Or, strange definition lie is.

*Also time data non-medical grade masks would covid. learned home-made mask effective, started recommending them. Again, lie way. change policy based learned. Considering alternative hundreds thousands millions unnecessary deaths, weighing costs going do? Dude, mean... feel like... I'm acid flashback right now... agree. kind class action suit group people likely got sick go organizers. sure thing exists.  Costco offers great running gear great price. like REI well.

Edit: smartwool socks! God damn would BAD things Jillian Michaels though. tried backtrack. ""You wear mask, protect OTHERS!"" basically, virus scary, might fine, could spread grandma. Okay then...

Thanks Australia universal FREE health care system IFR CFR same. Strange said 60/330, article referenced suggested could low 20%, 330 X 0.2 = 66 million people.

Then low, we're current cases go away. course, even that's right, still Another article referenced mention US number least 6 24 times reported. would put range 36 million 144 million. enough reach herd immunity suggested articles.

Really? 6 x 6 144? looking highest number?

You admit wrong, fine. know much actual cases scientific consensus saying heterogeneous heard immunity level is. 

And China could've reached already certain locales, include ones hardest hit.

But hey, pride. least that. problem really two sides. fact many sides. 


The problem large group folks simple worse, mean. longer understand either nuance use good faith help us resolve complex problems. 

We suffering slow motion train wreck lot people demanding keep driving. could apply FL even approved medical reasons, student choices staffing issues priorities. Many (including me, pregnancy) go back person either whole day half days even documentation doctors. push teachers teach online person students exactly time solve staffing issues, leave much room accommodating risk (and also effective either group students). Even herd immunity met 20% population immune (the lowest estimates) 0.5% IFR would 1.4 million deaths. I'm sorry China able hide tragedy kind scale. could much innovation combat virus. Exactly! know masks fairly effective preventing droplet output, also partially effective preventing droplet inhalation. beginning outbreak lot uncertainty relative contributions droplets, aerosolized particles, fomites transmission.

*That's* uncertainty masks protecting wearer came from, clear masks needed protect against. Given importance fomites transmission respiratory viruses, importance aerosols transmission high R0 viruses like measles, understandable people over-estimated importance routes, thus under-estimating importance droplets extent masks protect wearer.

Combine fact beginning also know importance asymptomatic carriers transmission, much reason think healthy members public wearing masks would much good.

Then combine:

1. fact expected healthy members public wearing masks would much good
2. fact PPE shortage lot people would tried buy medical masks even told use cloth instead.

And get reasonable-but-extremely-wrong decision tell members public wear masks unless sick. big conspiracy deceive public, people acted good intentions turned very, wrong. end. her. RIP. object would everyone handling? doorbell? 4.5/10, would recommend. yes Fauci used verb noun. muzzle someone prevent freely sharing opinions.

when muzzle person group obviously literally putting muzzles faces. always way. always inadvertently infected others colds, flus, bronchitis, chicken pox, pneumonia, bunch stuff. chain infection would bad outcome, never called people murderers part chain. comes territory sharing planet microbes. 

This new covid morality, everyone responsible everyone else’s health infinite chain, workable. means never step house, ever. risk we’re harbouring symptomatic infection never zero. comment might removed political, I'll go ahead say anyways truth. individual modicum objectivity rational thinking must admit Trump absolute moron unfit lead country. buy one outside Russia? flatten curve prevent hospitals run.... rest, cats bag.... wear mask, use good hygiene. 

I crack hear people think controlled.... delayed... thats it. 

Even make good vaccine... likely 50% 75% effective... 50% actually take it. Ultimately protects ~25% people... long take roll mass vaccinations.... ???

People drunk think anything controlled. Americans really stupid

You'd surprised stupid populations world wide are. huge anti vac movements group Europe / Asia like US.  clarification sake shadowy riverside gatherings? Imagine boomer apologist lol Strange said 60/330, article referenced suggested could low 20%, 330 X 0.2 = 66 million people.

Another article referenced mention US number least 6 24 times reported. would put range 36 million 144 million. enough reach herd immunity suggested articles. read papers yet still rejecting science like?

are flat earther creationist well?

No worries are, think either worse yall covid denying derpies. Kasten’s facility Greensboro faith-based, staff required pay state’s unemployment fund, eligible receive state-funded benefits first laid off.

Yeah, would thought people would jumping chance work poverty parents—mostly mothers—will find increasingly untenable, financially logistically, work outside home. It’s eventuality could cripple women’s advancement workplace, exacerbate inequality, put drag U.S. economic recovery.

This would never one child. child ruin woman's financial future. seen many women stuck poverty years high cost childcare + inability go school (eduation better job) work time. Proper miracle.  Reading stuff.  *Fauci later night home* said paws pause!  Literally exact opposite. thought spread easily, killed young people, 5% fatality rate. sarcasm self-own? hit points actually mentioned.

This. went shopping back March barely starting wore mask, *because fucking respiratory virus.* beyond obvious mask better nothing. First impressions everything. 

If WHO, CDC et al going lie, better lie would've say mask effective, would turn true, hard data support yet. depressing think could've stemmed public told *the harmful* lie. Bring back wine, jazz, drugs, flapper girls...

Apparently know happened 20s outside downtown nightclubs. capitalism destroyed ___________. Even 30-40% population gets vaccine would likely enough hit transmission rate put 1, well 1. Especially considering vulnerable people (store clerks, doctors, dentists etc) would getting shot more. smart left wild. (Increase cases)..(increase hospitalizations)..(increase deaths)..(oh shit, need right thing)..(decrease new cases)..(decrease hospitalizations)..(decrease deaths)..(f shit, I’m virus. Time get drink on!)

Rinse repeat agree I’m 63. don’t want anyone stop living lives me. (I also don’t want stop living life, that’s another story.)  dont get sued orbit, LLC set shield liability does. contain 100 cases... think lockdown going curb 7 million current cases...?? 

All would delay inevitable.  

Wear mask... wash hands.... learn surf.... wave ain't stopping anyone. People confused suffered delirium... I'd say orange guy might positive all. Look Prep act. liability here. upfront masks beginning: N95 make guarantee protection, surgical masks perfect still pretty good, cloth masks whatever. said buy surgical masks limited supply would useful among first responders scattered among citizens rarely left quarantine anyways. recommendation made knowing eventually production would ramp enough masks go around, could tell everyone buy them.

In meantime, ran studies found cloth masks actually work pretty well (not perfect, still), surprise, started recommending those. alone, would say lost cause. willful ignorance could end killing someone. American agree 100%. 

You belong 3rd world nation, dealt issues like many years(with little help 1st world nations like mine) take seriously.

At best, ""I born American"" likely lose super power status quite time. maybe bad thing... need learn less proud honestly. I'm one ignoring science. data even argument except insults tu quoque fallacies.

again.

you read paper engage substantive debate. that's goading you. think protest riot fits personal politics magically safe protest gathering fit personal politics automatically foolish dangerous. Large gatherings kinds deemed irresponsible, reprehensible, etc.

No, think outside masks help mitigate risks trust peer reviewed science shared rejected without reading.

and valuing racial justice concerts hypocrisy mental gymnastics sad pathetic.

Ive seen cheer for, give shit think sad pathetic. couldnt stop people hording toilet paper think Dr. Fauci said use masks theres shortage, people would like ""ok sure wont stock pile Dr. Fauci"" turn blind eye? Yeah, believe got bridge sell NYC.  comment crap. life lost.

Avoiding America's real #1 killer, crappy metabolic health, real villain everyone tip toeing around. Later bud.  US reached herd immunity? Well, called daily tampon. think expectations set point. Could please explain? Good shit, works. *probably* does. awesome. simply stated problem addressed right there. said masks work. shortage. 


instead saying public doesnt need masks.  


People gonna panic buy horde things regardless, would least set standard. got whole bunch tards thinking families deaths fucking hoax.

Thanks linking. Seems transverse myelitis worrysome condition, outcome varies full recovery moderate severe disability.

Which good, likely caused another issue, vaccine.  Absolutely nothing new this.

tl;dr people become long-haulers dont know long last them. sufficiently cheap/quick test fairly inaccurate still incredibly useful mitigating spread thing- never make behavior decisions assuming negative result correct. positive result result caution following accurate test. Still better nothing. make argument vaccine anyway. fuck lmao that's legitimately shocking compare public statements since beginning. He's recording crisis ever even kicked talking virus spreads air primarily, touch, multiple times deadly flu, limited elderly people. actually comes moderately well-informed couple clips. ever said (and mostly still continues say...) publicly flu big deal. 

I'm pretty confused though fuck told aerial spread though already knew shit FEBRUARY SEVENTH. remember like many weeks toward beginning March/April, general perception spread touch, everything washing hands touching face sanitizing surfaces all. Wtf that? value withholding information public, get it. Thank detailed reply.

1. Standard practice pharma companies, seems (not specifically, shady unethical ways make money).

2. That's actually pretty fucked up. focused more? say I'm living rock, heard anything. That's... Disheartening.

3. shady. Fuck pharma companies.

Thanks again. guess Pfizer Oxford me... Except forever almost certainly go way manipulate public buying videos/classes. Fitness Demand inundated Jillian. Official policy test obviously sick maybe contacts cases. open general public even people suspect might infected. Private labs offer test those, test expensive relative income people prefer hope best. Yep, get vaccine dont care people do. completely incorrect assessment me. I'm self employed (not working home ever... physically possible) get furlough pay (so want complain people needing get back work...) second job pub quitting beginning covid. far there.

I'm even going argue saying. think there's criticism aimed anyone working anywhere. I'm sure got interpretation from. criticism purely hypocrisy government nonsensical measures. new guidelines nothing, really, stop spread. forces people would gather small groups areas densely populated. nonsensical potentially could increase infection rates. think incompetence but, rather, synical. seriously concerned, would close businesses (I think reasons stated).

I'm sure interpreted wrote criticism. Although, glass shields plastic visors almost functionally useless
 way make people feel safe.. think they're bit dumb. really wear mask wash hands surfaces frequently work. people need able work frequent social places financial mental health reasons.

When people say OK sit pub, they're saying govt bugger personal life. pub workers irresponsible. think remain open... They’ll busy repairing damage current administration caused. 

Locating 900th ethical violation won’t top priority. point anti-vaxxers getting everyone take huge problem. may running I'd communication pausing diligence. 

Imagine vaccine voluntary, anti-vaxxers world current anti-mask social distancing people rejecting getting it. visiting friends family. hopefully point they're already immune. people gonna mad say 2%* population can't get vaccine 3%* choose to, despite ending lockdown cases never drop people back street. deaths go 2% health problems. Society never go back normal vaccine age parents fear infants kids may get inflammatory disease.

*Fictional numbers said 675,000 passengers screened 15 airports, “**fewer 15** identified COID-19.” 

Yes, will. actually test them, check temperature look symptoms. waste time money. 15 travelers 5ish months means needed. International travelers problem. problem homegrown US now.

Ok yeah, I’ll agree changed course time, isn’t back forth w/o reason changing. 
It “this evidence shows.” 

For instance, based opinions I’ve seen about, timeline potential vaccine seems ambitious. 
So, expect push timeline. Holy shit It’s borderline insane rewrite history say took seriously point since March. supernova gaslighting. week 3. Pelosi's haircut!?!?!?!@# No, blame American Lack Living Wage Standards Culture

aka rank capitalism seeming Transverse myelitis. 

If caused vaccine, much worry vaccines carry incredibly tiny risks happening. around 50 hospitalizations year related vaccine-caused Transverse myelitis. acceptable risk. 

However, apparently guy neurological issues beforehand. worry people issues (if guess, multiple sclerosis) might high risk Transverse myelitis accept vaccine potentially, knows. Good plan. I’ll hit online thrift stores see see :) USA #1 misleading statistic. Wow! one post sub got locked mods comment redirecting r/politics. I'm tired even care anymore fucking stupid moderation sub. Right time winter mistake putting info book. hid average Trump voter better they'd shot information sun. could possible effects 5, 10, 15 years later =/= don’t anything 5, 10, 15 years. People waiting virus get control us send kids school 15 years. honest, airport screening Covid is/was spreading rampantly US really accomplish anything.

But moving deploying rapid saliva testing customs.  simple health screening would seem like good permanent policy.

Sad US gone unquestioned international leader infectious disease laughing stock ineffective inconsistent policies don’t know you’re downvoted; I’ve similar experiences profession well. Weirdly, Reddit + Google ≠ decades professional experience. Check r/running recommendations, posts time it!

I’m fan generic amazon tights (I’m dude way #teamtights ), tank top long sleeves. Gloves hat well scarf around neck able pull down. Brooks coat gets real cold throw sweat pants tights. orders cease prescreening operations came White House, strict orders keep information secret public announcement made. 

So much contact tracing, main point tests (an address reach). Fauci quote? Straight top post. well aware phase 4 trial take place registration trial.

What mean since vaccine rolled wide scale quickly possible long-term side-effects usually phase 4 study detect wont noticed.

Thus even complication rare due extraordinary amount people take vaccine might still significant amount cases.

Imagine example Cerivastatin would prescribed hundreds millions time. I’m thinking it’ll accessible need early Jan. personal take. primary point studies longitudinal, I'm trying say. likely would concerned long immunity ""lasts"" (which varies person person anyway.) Trump's timeline pan out. Earliest, risk groups medical worker's winter, mass roll general populations next year. Dude you’re legit least bit psycho hahaha assure almost one tbe US surprised. read 50-60% vaccines. 

But regardless, high enough wear scarf. Slightly warms air prior inhale. 200 month unfathomable me. spend $10 lol 21% ??? actual fuck? Taiwan's restrictions different US right now. agree. don’t know. That’s comment bs I’m sorry credentials come like huge know all? investment class disinterested comprehensive response this, interested human cost, loves angry marginally less well you. spin things beginning enough balance lack anything March. Everyones risk, dumbass.

Never line sounded ominious now.... LOL? understand outrage gyms. Everyone wipes equipment using now, sort naturally social distance working out. honestly feel like one safest public locations indoors. weren’t wearing masks. passengers were. point sanitizing surfaces effective transmitted breathing air infected person, we've known 5 months already order go gym feel safe ignore pretend droplet transmission.

My friend hospital Covid right now. sounds like he's walked six flights stairs he's *laying bed* temperature 103.5. really scary. think got touching surface touching nose, sharing room people talking breathing. wife starting get symptoms now. awful. /r/bodyweightfitness meets /r/confidentlyincorrect. 

Well done! April, CDC recommended face coverings prevent spread COVID-19, Fauci pushed use well.

[Video shows outdated face mask guidance Dr. Anthony somebody's conspiracy theory got boo-boo. grammar title makes pretty hard understand first think concern lot us cat owners choice go outside every often. 

Stuff like grocery shopping (place go offer curbside delivery/pickup) going work/school/etc.

We social distance/isolate much possible, takes one time us pass cat play game ""hot potato"" virus. :(  agree saying, know person is. Wiki says LA fitness trainer, know more? Yeah people meet like minded people enjoy spending time vain exhibitionists. enough people participating? True. went school PA always called it’s initials IUP People saying closed borders called racist, pelosi said go Chinatown, Cuomo put sick people nursing homes, Fauci said masks, downplaying good leadership move keep people panicking

Aren't things true? spin putting context things? idea common. saw trial paused felt sad. read article felt lot less sad. consider story story broke Russia compromised National Security (DHS) Dan Coates, I'd say we've waking CCP control almost 4 years now. question really compromat Putin Trump? money one following:

1. sex tape Donald calls prostitutes ""Ivanka""
2. Control Trump's offshore bank accounts
3. sex tape Donny &amp; Ivanka
4. Ivanka sex w/Stalin's corpse
5. Trump sex w/Stalin's corpse, yelling ""Oh Ivanka"". Straps sold separately. compatible select ears. protesting got exposed? figures seen Spanish Flu 50--100 million people, 1918-1920. Memorial Day feels like last week, also ten years ago. Excuse me.

Now, many people killed virus spread children? According article, people make 25% population. half, overindex drastically one might think. Basically rates double you’d expect. Seems like could better job talking about, responding to, virus stopped lumping anyone 0-18 “child” category. That’s virus works 
“She showing symptoms time cleaning protocols followed, district said.” 

Oh well could happened!!! 'lovely' person. wrong. rude. Goodbye. go earnest question hoping get answer to. seems discussion always Sweden vs. rest Western world. Enduring restrictions hard lockdowns economic hardships cause vs. lockdowns light restrictions order minimize disruption, accepting ton deaths.

But understanding, countries like South Korea Taiwan basically managed avoid both. Like I've read Taiwan lockdown, still managed contain virus, despite huge population ton travelers mainland China.

Am missing something here? everyone talking like one way other, countries managed both? I'm wrong, I'd love hear I'm missing. would thought!? lied political purposes Americans died it. warned late December intel community. Heaven's sake fooled political viewpoint. Hello. think give told so's hardly test people duh. Yea...every 4 years...""abortion""...if like abortion, ONE! want woman abortion got problem kid cage. I'll bet think Jesus white! put religion us would sick, put mine them! Sign going front yard(knock Trumps head) Nov. 4 read: One Great Thing Trump: know really stupid people are, put Trump signs yards Trump bumperstickers cars!!! religion says can't sex daughter cousin...how would like that!!! thought months could smart relax laws consume alcohol. Intresting, think means wont much delay continuation trial than? Yeet curiousity, think reason lockdowns? Putin's. get Trump electoral college, internet around Mussolini came power. Blame servers, prefer make way tips. thing that's uncommon public whole process been. New vaccines medications constantly undergoing trials, starting stopping various points different reasons, hear it. trials though, make sure adverse reactions kept minimum. go CVS. Well schedule website go drive thru, easy Yeah that’d misleading. could use stat fit whatever narrative want. Big reason don’t take stats serious.

Don’t know got downvoted much, understood saying. hive mind real. conspiracy believable you. Assuming dont believe everything slightly questionable conspiracy. Tell millionaires billionaires US. horrifically true. hate them, much hate him. case? flew two weeks ago, get screened desperate.

Covid not, visit country treats like criminal enter. also one guy policies would love support. trial going restarted. Presumably continue once/if get clear. server rely tips first place. 🍊 time flu season. another mistake. Guessing either child moron. rational individual would see total economical collapse positive never understand people willfully believe spin. Fuck assholes.  It’s amazing US one infected countries little restrictions gyms wearing mask. 

In Canada - number cases low - yet strict regulations regarding gyms almost everywhere else. 

Gyms Ontario, example, require online bookings one-hour time slots let ~50 people per slot. one-hour slot, gym shut disinfected 30 minutes next one-hour slot. 

Sure, constantly secure workout spot online annoying, workout limited hour annoying, every machine off-limits social distancing annoying... feel safe (as safe expected leaving house pandemic) going public gym way handling things.

Given virtual free-for-all US gyms mandating masks, I’m inclined agree Jillian likely you’ll contract Covid gym. But, Canada proves done safe way ... I’m still sure US seems problem imposing actual restrictions real length time. says clearly article lawn care business going. comment seems indicate took look article I'm doubts reading comprehension skills. 


Edit: maybe acting stupid purpose troll, could too. guess could say euphemism. Jersey ;\_;

Which interesting neighboring states, organizers write ""CDC Compliant"" flyer nobody bothers 

You wear masks these, remote-area festival gradually goes window think clinical trials, peer review, regulatory approval are? Yeah. partner nationally ranked strength athlete. quit gym didn’t shut mandatory shutdown actively encouraging members keep coming in, didn’t require masks, weren’t regularly sanitizing equipment. sucked take 3 months training would normally prepping meet, wouldn’t risk getting sick getting sick since multiple comorbidities compromised immune system. finally found gym compliance really affected numbers last meet. That’s pure doom gloom. Thanks. I'd love dude flight! fucking knew airborne least 5 times deadly worst flu- said tape... I'm horrified depths even know had. called hoax said would 15 cases, would gone like miracle. intentional criminal homicidal. person holds position POTUS US duty public. intentionally derelict duty 200,000 American deaths personally caused jail. Maybe. moron wants hundreds kids banging door. moron? county 10 soldiers returned peacekeeping operation Congo tested positive, definitively undetected spread Congo. rumor mill suggests parents aren’t testing sick kids. confirmed positive requires 10-14 days home. Lol word. I’m supporting new laws- guidelines- face pubs? supermarkets hundreds people? discount stores sell garden furniture call essential pop screen place tape floor? 
Pubs mitigate measures shops ever did. live surrounded beaches full overflowing, still are. It’s pubs. It’s poor leadership, dislike rules whole. Pubs don’t come matter. Eat help matter. (My local restaurant seats 80 400 people - one day!!) Telling teens going get sick, die face consequences matter. Pubs bending backwards whatever hell worlds vague Covid guidelines spread 26 pages. 

Pubs air quality shouldn’t equation all. 
I agree. Wear mask, wash hands stay far away people feel safe.  Yeah isn’t “they good people”. Even are, base expectation. Zoomer asthma. I'd rather die also. go hospital network, may unknowingly see doctor network.

Sometimes takes seen doctor get crazy bill. hospital people room time asking questions checking you. get surprise bill network specialist ""provided services"" change opinion, lied. later admitted it. Also like ignored whole gain function thing like, eh that's ok. Or, hear out, literally way get back normal face unprecedented crisis. wish could costs money. :( Wait, what?! lol indicating 2021 implement fully huge improvements testing would made. Pfizer vaccines. go back three weeks second dose talking rapid PCR testing around, talking new cheap saliva tests getting though FDA approval stiff everyone promise pay. Carnival sideshow. Unemployed mom? get that, Fauci presenting facts whole time clear Trump fired another ‘yes man’ still personally would went whatever independent source used convey message data.

Now kind feel duped him. According claims they’ve known since early February. way someone expertise didn’t know longer, especially via word mouth colleagues. Hmmmmm. Interesting choice removal bud. What's next? Tapes get leaked Trump admitting he's liar. never news Thats called propaganda campaign. Take care. still required time.  vaccine turn pandemic like switch.  tool enhance defense herd immunity.  still need combined societal restrictions.  many people actually read entire article ? FWIW, title article question reader posed *The Atlantic's* Dr. James Hamblin. response actually quite nuanced worth reading. parent- info also kept saying mandatory testing students. confusing day optional.

As well info virtual students attending. 

So possible kids sent would gone otherwise confusing info sent. Report Sounds like we're page. Kids learn home beat COVID. gotten tested yet reason. knew way insurance companies government willing foot bill 

I tested twice week. better footing bill I'm sure hell not. knew death rate 1%, asymptomatic spread incredibly rare, wasn’t serious threat young people decided cause panic could jeopardize entire way life, economy, education upcoming generation, mental health entire country? nerve man. Must be. talking rapid antigen tests, designed, manufactured (in modest amounts) received emergency authorisation US FDA. It’s matter scaling far actual hardware concerned. Implementation another issue. mentioned get points election.  legit sources learn communicate new information pandemic continues.  Us all? Many us never stopped working normal job. *should* one English English words like *boot* *bonnet* think use Germany really ""shut down"" like article said?  grocery trips, people fully confined homes, etc? want lose job. knows gets fired, Trump replace yes man. He's walking thin ice. feel bad guy. appropriate advice would use personal makeup artist pandemic Probably not. error spotted corrected quite quickly. Get Ring Fit switch it! fun way workout. love it. tested 55+. lack kids trials baffling through. (Not virology medical professional, but) 

you isolate together person also positive.


Afterwards, clear info whether immune. Therefore, go back taking regular precautions avoid infection. It’s crazy narrow mind many people become. It’s eradicating one singular virus matter cost. Maybe it’s time start weighing costs deciding continuing manner worth it?? wonder many deaths Europe time period.

Edit - lol I'm genuinely curious, trying put anyone don’t seem understand. There’s nothing wrong exhibitionism it’s fake that’s lame, covid created weird situation gyms bars risky nonessential businesses yet many choose hill die on.

For example movie theatres aren’t actually safe. without N95 face shield. without low community virus levels. without people mutually agreeing forego popcorn removing PPE communal good, love movies. even let theatres open popcorn police there’s always gonna guy slow walks small buttered popcorn Lord Rings Extended Edition he’s guy.

And gyms guy right now. What’s happening shows people are. I’m guy stands like “hey that’s kinda fucked lol” judgment inconsequential. Everyone trying get vaccine way quick, people going die companies make sure trials done correctly. Baffles companies/countries claim close vaccine yet full trials never exercised. think stopping fast food? Meanwhile Amazon destroyed millions Main Street USA jobs themselves. goes back Nixon Kissinger opening trade China law. Ah yes that's called it. know thing understand name. would rule large part teaching staff. (I say fat educator). isolated.

My wife healthy young.

Why misery? long covering problem last it’s beyond obvious is, fact, problem? Muzzles aren’t gags. using word muzzle? Plenty specialists familiar stage 3 delays I'm sure. I'm poking fun number Yeah JNJ starting phase 3 month. Obviously massive manufacturing capacity could end one first widely available ones mid next year.  They’re important us fly semi-regularly know whole spiel heart. also get people flying who’ve never airplane before, it’s important know stuff. Kids deserve education.

Period. sure arguing with. Nothing said disagrees wrote **do** agree you. Different circumstances require different ways thinking. tip order carry servers getting regular dine business atm. paradoxical simultaneous coronavirus time dilation/contraction. real phenomenon  Neurological disorders extremely regular occurrence linked vaccines. I’ll still happily call naive think otherwise haven’t bothered look into. substantial evidence happening vaccine companies signing liable damages know people spending time see negative side effects. many others quick jump bandwagon without single bit research. 
I sure hell hope doesn’t happen you, anyone know. know lot human body responds long term SARS CoV 1, SARS CoV 2’s close cousin, thousands human coronaviruses humans exposed to. 

It’s poignant example, father got shingles face, absolutely horrible him, get shingles vaccine soon can, reasonably assume long term damage like shingles, something affect like 20% seniors. Trump’s new adviser—the neuroradiologist Scott Atlas—is pushing strategy lets virus rip non-elderly population bid reach herd immunity. policy folly Sweden, nowhere near herd immunity, one world’s highest COVID-19 death rates, regretful state epidemiologist. 


1) strategy (their strategy based serious, sustainable measures prevent infection, herd immunity)


2) Also clearly folly sustainable strategy paying dividends right (deaths negligble, less infection nordics). sustainable strategy going look better out. needless loss. Why?  feel sorry read this. lmfao. Goes history. Totally bigger, better person here. Lol. Check more. decent pics, people mostly like comments. fun. haven’t teachers unions stopped morbidly obese elderly teachers entering classrooms? Thats drink kool aid shit FDA doesn’t oversee things India UK. say - wouldn’t sit well President overrode States nationwide mandate. However, lax, made America lax it’s mess. Given top post sun right take person famous (or infamous). say something get famous Reddit every day never heard her.  Ur podcast sux Called it, guillian barr syndrome. Irrelevant. Trump get info legit sources. idiot coworker got going gym.

Don't go gym pandemic! everyone would put damn mask. That's kinda worked Spanish Flu . took couple years, though; premature belief beat it, deadlier second wave even third wave that. would think would attempted solution worked 100 years ago start this, avoid ambiguity ""do masks work?"" citing prior precedent. need move baby boomers get work. It’s deferred. Look what’s running Fox News 

“Fauci tells Fox 'didn't get sense' Trump 'was distorting anything' ? What? Shut media, yes. “We want give students sense pride accomplishment” Credentials? data available anyone. spelling credentials elementary school need know know reading countless times years. Coronavirus deadly flu. Oh dear. Everyone dog wanting divest UK 

It's funny people think UK different. What's actually happening people realising real UK contrary moronic trope massive divesting, things largely continuing normal. makes even hilarious ilk bleating imminent economic implosion 5 years quite literally nothing note occurred (barring COVID fair bring mix considering widespread global economic meltdown caused it)? 

All know others might pulling money, others - place far emphasis looking things nature - think full shit investing massively. Google. Apple. Amazon. know you? Sure do.

Imagine thinking country agency resources disposal written stupid peasants vote way wanted them? Talking emits vastly type droplets likely remain airborne extended periods. Well ur paying $200, u cant really say free u  really early pandemic Yeah family plans always expensive. Plus nice gym offered classes free(they hundreds), pools, private trainers, physical therapy site (which costs more), free tennis courts water park. Also free child care kids work out, kids swimming lessons things included well. gym whole lot services well. Read wrong, thought wanted go moon October weeks away. Come on, unrealistic. Covid anti-anti-science virus. people believe really choice.

Many surrounded exclusively people ""the team"", likely alienating friends family (who weren't) process.

Admitting wrong point means give current social net risk shunned self picked society. Even everyone would feel way would deadlocked admit stay spin-feeding spiral rest lives.

That's cults work, replacing grown social net constructed social net people trapped. There's reason getting cult usually feasible support groups. Well, thread fun one watch don’t need warn me, I’m stupid. I’m sorry hear that. hope friend turns corner go home soon.  Well president actively everything power spread it, tends happen. He's seems fake video, doubt ever it. He's shilling make another buck. Lol what? That's absurd. clearly never met adult Disney fanatic. They're terrifying. Developing MS definitely common thing happen vaccines. Think many people get vaccinated year. Don’t think would national, front page news statistically significant number people developed debilitating, chronic neurological condition widely distributed vaccination? Don’t quick call others naive, clear correlation here. world needs weld US inside now. Yeah, really fucking stupid. California blew advantage 4 weeks stupidity reopening. Well we're good Amy Acton left idiot would go gym right now?! Lol, piece news alone gonna drop % people willing vaccinate 10% so. 

It already going like 60% US. 

We long haul bois. Bots swarming every corona post reddit hours new Trump tape. kinda silly reddit still control bot usage. mean reddit born 2005 still cluster fuck bots posting karma, people posting old content get account karma sell propaganda bots.

I think subs without bots small niche ones. Haha - kidding. Imagine Norway Denmark start surging like rest Europe Sweden continues along low levels. already see headlines coming. fauci article linked corona? article 4 sentences corona-related also names zhong first doctor made public corona transmitted person person, untrue. counting vaccine going checks. rushed. article different %? Yeah, theres room nuance personal opinion here! Tribalism Extreme! Pick side quiet! (Also, *must* pick *my* side wrong get yelled at.) Lol. headline implies got Covid teacher, rather happen teacher got Covid something else. Yes, teacher, contact children school open. Trapped exactly feel. 

Thanks though mate. 

Stay safe. society we’ve decided one deadly enough take seriously. you’re American you’re watching country can’t get thing Curries back work, making money, racing opportunities Americans. Opening schools likely go like Israel set us back complete shutdown levels bad “life going on”

We’re like speeder freeway, go fast always getting stopped tickets slow drivers getting us incoming travellers would less likely infected random person already America would suspect. flu kills children COVID. numbers. Time take flu seriously COVID. Lockdown life. vitro, even bleach good vitro much vivo Fair point. Even best, get it. shows unpredictable thing is, that’s world lockdown. many old wealthy arses much risk anyone, scares them! Covid19 indiscriminate virus there. don’t travel anywhere get it, don’t need risk mosquitoes, filth unprotected sex. wear mask, stay home wash hands 10x day, still get it. thought turned frogs gay? mean get *ever*, wait months/years get eventually? One person died Covid-19 yesterday 14 patients ICU. Number new cases yesterday 204. 

So depending get news, either stunning success hellish nightmare. one wanted go even covid kidding. state underclassmen attending UW (or major university sticker price) year beyond me. Get general credits way online technical community college.

Sucks upper classmen grad students though. aren’t even half way number hit end year. No, fact made comment shows trash sense humor is. definitely need water. mutha fucka burning. vast vast majority international arrivals go airports anyways covid Europe showing signs second wave.

America: even close true. took shampoo. sad story. really hope get student. 

At child's school (upstate sc) leap day consisted batches students rotating half day cohorts. So, 300 kids school time day, whole week. Way way better normal. Everyone masked.

Outside school, likely run unmasked crowded gatherings, even try hard avoid them. can't even pick prescription without half store unmasked wearing mask beneath nose. actual fuck. nightmare never ends low expectations America ding ding ding. screening supposed eliminate possible cases one among many precautions across society reducing crucial %s spread. people screen out, stay home, \_reduce\_ transmission. people love smugly zero-sum assume everyone stupid careless. possible interest would government mandating masks suitable single second longer necessary? get point, think objections masks really boil toddler-level tantrums masks uncomfortable want wear telling to. Maybe something inbetween ;) several tens times Clearly didn’t notice happened 2 weeks quarantine people got bored Pretty cruel quarantine people northern Norway part year enjoy outdoors ... Strawman. Please point democracy 'cure worse virus'. 

**You're using false equivalence, golden mean fallacy.** seem ignoring real distortion coming side that's self-destructive anti-science. Sometimes, one side truly awful. 

To paraphrase reddit comment, equal sides. sensible ones listen scientists, folks wear masks mock advice experts LITERALLY spend lives learning handle situation. Yep. instead would say things like ‘well people fraudulently claim work bar get paid stay home’. real job... bet even change tire let alone landlord does. 

Maybe get real job buy damn house. vaccination. need scratch microchips skin right now. Best anesthetic meth. get doped meth start scratching right now. could anywhere. Better definitely getting exposed. Agreed. really strange people seem absolutely intent rewarding countries lying. watched Kingsman day, packed church movie. Man that’s refreshing, original non talk-pointy take! /s

On average 48,000 people die day cardio vascular disease. 7,000 approximately die Covid. “Covid deaths” really due comorbidity. yeah, it’s equivalent paper cut grand scheme things. long term effects possible conclusive studies evidence present yet: enough time elapsed yet conclude either way. know lot top athletes come back compete testing positive Covid, without appreciable hinderance.
I maintain misinformation, designed fear monger school reopening. lady didn’t contract virus students, unrelated topic hand: transmission school environment.

Tracing employees owner would probably lead back someone governor owes favor to.  Tracing useless levels. Wait back low levels, use tool.  I’m sure children would rather end dead friends teachers heart damage spend time home families. 

This first time history parents actually raise children, true horror it. speak experience schools (the one teach ones friends teach at) little help prevent spread. disinfecting, going state (and weirdly enough district) guidelines reopening/sports/masks. Kids symptomatic purposely tested keep going school. Kids avoiding fevers ice packs fever-reducing medicines. Zero contact tracing reporting. I'm saying teachers worse grocery store clerks anything like that, I'm saying school started starting soon much country. schools already open ones concerned spread care less preventing (like mentioned above). Many schools open, see whether makes difference weeks month. think everyone agrees hope numbers go everything works fine.  Gave life kids to.

Instead ""flying"" every vaccine, actually put rail / over-road distribution system. Again, would knock numbers way down.

Instead producing one facility, produce vaccine multiple places around world, significantly reducing logistic distribution challenge.

Consider fact cannot manufacture many vaccines day, take time, call month, space distribution time frame even farther. Even wanted send once, created long period time.

Majority help parents children waiting test

The parents financially legally trouble, politicians see sickness benefits solution

A broad political majority willing help many parents forced stay home child sent home school day care due infected comrade therefore waiting tested covid-19.

Rising infection rates mean many places three- four-day waiting period tests, often parents' holidays days used, care days account.

The time right send extra bill employers, joint fund pay.

Employment rapporteur Hans Andersen (V)

The social partners - Trade Union Confederation (FH) Danish Employers' Association (DA) - disagree whether situation compared completely extraordinary situations snow chaos gives right unpaid absence. Thus, parents financially legally trouble.

Now political majority emerging solution state compensates parents level sickness benefits.

""The time right send extra bill employers, joint fund pay,"" says employment spokesman Hans Andersen (V), backed SF, Unity List, Radicals, Conservatives Danish People's Party.

“Many parents unreasonable situation forced stay home. state compensate least level sickness benefits, ""says health spokesman Peder Hvelplund (EL).

The National Board Health recommends children sent home school day care infection classroom kindergarten tested.

The child stay home child tested negative first time.

You choose test children 12 years without symptoms instead keep child home 7 days.

If child develops symptoms home, child kept home child symptoms 48 hours.

When keeping child home, play see children people outside household. However, o.k. go walk good distance others.

Source: Danish Health Medicines Authority's new booklet parents children sent home

At DF, employment spokesman Bent Bøgsted states state take financial responsibility, state sends healthy children home testing via guidelines schools day care institutions.

Both Parents' National Organization (Fola) School Parents calling solution similar one politicians finding.

“We currently seeing increasing number infections therefore parents need compensated. now, uncertainty puts enormous pressure families, ""says Signe Nielsen, chairman Fola.

The demands made unions Foa Djøf, starting receive inquiries members.

Minister Employment Peter Hummelgaard convened FH DA meeting Thursday.

""I fully aware parents may experience challenges children sent home school institution,"" minister said written response. Agreed. NYC hybrid model pushed back start school year couple weeks, though think teachers still report 8th. 

Also, apply WFH semester conditions CDC list get doctors note. read whole thing notice don’t call blanket person reopening places high rates covid, that’s what. Yes that’s key point. you’re going take personal risk, need isolate return. It’s unlikely anyone contracted virus, let’s say Saturday night, contagious next day. returned home isolated. It’s really irresponsible people still don’t understand. Lololol need /s? spewing anti-Xi propaganda.

Nothing propaganda honourable. duburu already pointed out, epidemiology, Pandemic refers infectious disease infected statistically significant number people across multiple countries. definitely describes current situation. Also, considering R0 (viral reproductive rate) COVID-19 consistently hovered 1.5 - 2.5 range, pandemic. 


To explain (the movie Contagion better job this) flu R0 value 1, means person flu, guess likely transmit 1 person. COVID's number accurate, means COVID 2 3 times infectious flu. U.S. death toll already exceeded 100,000 people, global death toll exceeded 900,000 approaching 1,000,000. pandemic. 


The reason people annoyed people like COVID-19 real serious threat species. People deciding take safety precautions incredibly ignorant, selfish. Advocating ""real"" pandemic tantamount saying, "" personal opinion important health safety everybody around me."" Teachers front line Covid-19 pandemic. obesity kills high blood pressure caused Obesity opens door Covid-19 kill. Tumeric / Black pepper may help HBP. Thoroughly surprised Vitamin required daily among school teachers exposed plague. mean single strain Sweden? info regarding ""getting infected different strains"" part? Source? already said nothing. plump physique would place large demand oxygen her, often results death covid-19. surprises there. fact question downvoted says lot agenda many people have. huge study Iceland followed around 1200 people confirmed Covid-positive showed well 90% infected developed antibodies. might explain small amount people get re-infected.

And far know evidence get infected different strains Covid-19 willy nilly, statement pulled ass.

Edit: Here's study shows 91.1% infected developed antibodies antibodies declined 4 months. 

The explanation 8.9% produce antibodies mild infection immune system got tid virus quickly. Microsoft easy say this, probably correct say teaching done online. However, bigger picture.

School form daycare many working class people. kids old enough stay home own, would potentially asking every family give job order parent stay home kids. Many people cannot afford this, teachers would continue collect pay cheque, many kids families could forced poverty. idiotic statement make. thats schools open month, realize dumb sound? Check fear-mongering. College age 'kids' also adults, many outright depend sports education and/or career. Aren’t teachers protected unions? happen unionized workforce? way spin absolutely EVERYTHING upside down. Hahhaaaa. ""They save economy"".LMAO response. Seriously, media/state propaganda another level terms success brainwash. North Korea tries know citizens likely afraid brainwashed. Swedes actually brainwashed. Pakistan unique victory, also part culture. culture cannot necessarily replicated countries. Anyone give fake predictions may may happen. Cuz seems like greatest idea ever... many bad things recovered well really feel need flu shot. LOL.....West Nile, Scarlet fever, mysterious viruses couple times gave Cipro it, Kidney infections, strep throat countless times, flu countless times, chicken pox, stomach bug countless times, asthma random allergies things pop go away also. Gall Bladder removed, AFIB, Mitral Valve Prolapse. OK though. mom kept house immaculately clean maybe it, get immune response fight things, things get again. Also March got fever 4 days dizziness right around sick people work, fine 4 days. know touch 2020 nightmare not. 2 kids school COVID I’m virtual still I’m worried friends like they're *trying* make cases surge already have. It’ll gone Easter. One years. According whom? Jeffe Bezos? think you’re bitter you’re fatty sits around mom’s basement bitching glitches red dead redemption guess said, ""fuck it"". also need aware much COVID permanently damage body. way supposed “herd immunity” (which isn’t people advocating think is), lots damaged survivors.
‘ happened Sweden yet mean can't happen, that's said hopefully one brings new strain country. 

Swedes get damn defensive time, god learn take criticism. Dr. Tegnell sort god. stop one trump? There's room enough Donald, Donald jr, ivanka, one lesser trumps mt rushmore Lol... Butters jobs.

What said incredibly true US. used teacher, specifically one ""idealists"" described. truly give big push towards ""cynical bastard,"" enough make decide get got stuck profession making miserable.

Edit: spelling 410,000 *up to* 650,000 iirc *with* mitigation measures we've put place. nothing we'd likely cross 1 million fucking dead US roughly 9 months time (mar - dec). yes, sound logic. however, anyone make also reasonable enough put mask distance 2m person talks :) Oh god conspiracy theorists come force confirm. Congratulations.

*I'm fucking done.* get hit car develop gangrene hospital leg ripped off, might’ve died gangrene still died got hit car. Every single state closed correctly 1918 better economic rebound long-run deal neverending pandemic. Oh no. Next thing know become zombies NY teacher's union constrained Taylor Law. can't legally strike. sense, definitely ""strong"" union. One great things professionals fields science medicine change opinions advice based new information. fact, Dr. Fauci said beginning advice COVID-19 would evolve discovered new information it.

It lie. best advice could given based information available time. information updated, advice. us believe opposite, virus stay. That’s we’re willing put lives hold indefinitely. Almost 3 million people die year annually US. life expectancy 78. That’s also average age deaths Covid. 40% deaths took place nursing homes average life expectancy upon entering 2 years. many deaths prevented focusing factors causes covid. getting covid may extended lives months years ailments larger influence outcomes virus itself. don’t admit without embarrassment, used like Smash Mouth’s music. can’t bring listen anymore. 

What stupid move made playing shitshow. I’d love see it’s impacted music sales steaming. can’t one. Oh really? see coming 6 months away ""There thing sun""

""Those forget history doomed repeat it.""  KC suburb school district announced choose YEAR remote sending kids back criteria told us things based still ""red zone."" soon second worst political party takes office, people think got wrong start thinking getting right. people thought ok think everything going shit. political bullshit. US markets artificially supported nearly $10 trillion via Federal Reserve step actual economic data. Without level bailout actions plunge protection team, US market 50% sure people angry, far between.

Stop trying manufacture discontent. happening Hm, mother (70+) allowed visit old ladies knows live homes long taken place outdoors keep distance. making exceptions care home, thought norm? states, illegal teachers strike. print emails they'd releasing sources sources would get fired. one would tip ever again. 

Most news agencies verify information releasing they're wrong damage legally reputation wise would ruin them. Subtle use inverted commas... ingenious. Stating fact hospitalization half was. Also currently decreasing. yet one reinfected yet Sweden, statement well ""pulled ass"". believe me, nobody psychology department wanted this. Rip Yeah, what's point, humanity wiped yet 3x anual flu deaths 6 months control measures so... big deal? types make life. already heard 6 months ago. states struggle keep coronavirus nursing homes, employees work multiple facilities thought behind continuing spread. states also ones Republican governors? That's genuine question, know state mostly mix Saving money carve Trump Mount Rushmore would’ve made sense. pretty reasonable though, right?? average US citizen far likely Covid positive average person international flight abroad. lot low hanging fruit complain regarding White House mismanagement Covid, ain’t it. That’s tough. hope make better. Yup cat virus chances cats now, none mutate far.  Really really disappointed NJEA, fucking cowards. time someone dies flu, they’re endpoint chain infection. never thought call links chain murderers before.

for reason someone aids allowed go around smearing blood Deliberately infecting someone obviously shitty thing do, inadvertent transmission inevitable consequence sharing planet microbes use us hosts.

Taken logical conclusion means never leave house. 

or maybe leave house non-essential purposes know people dying result, mentality hard track consider moral implications situation actually going get people killed. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article None really. It’s like saying state 60 likely die car accident Covid sick classes started. What. I'm surprised strike measles typhoid floating around SJW parents. Literally don’t put UV filters intakes?? enough exposure kill virus? extend UV lights throughout piping...

Like, KNOW indoor recycled air super spreader .... don’t get  knew Biden covid. stop posting duplicate stories new angle, title, slight update? confusing people might know story another popular post referred previous day. Nope :) comparing severe cases anything undefined severity something else likely show severe thing dangerous. probably missing something tho :) can't tell sarcastic not, I'll say no, administration never wanted experts table unless expert's opinion/advice lines Trump believes true. Ousting intelligent, ethical people disagree standard operating procedure since took office. 

I think reason done Fauci good doctor position decades, 6 different presidents, reputation sides aisle top field, also completely unswayed politics. Every time gets pushed background, people across political spectrum clamor hear again. **42 people registered infected coronavirus Bergen last 24 hours. Several infected people complied quarantine rules.**

&amp;#x200B;

42 people registered infected coronavirus Bergen last 24 hours, City Councilor Roger Valhammer (Labor Party) stated press conference Thursday. 41 newly infected one old case.

The city council leader says several today's infected Bergen infected people complied quarantine obligation. encourages people comply imposed quarantine requirements.

\- must crystal clear: Everyone quarantined must quarantined, says City Councilor Valhammer.

He also refers study University Bergen National Institute Public Health published Thursday, half Norwegians break quarantine rules .

Violation quarantine rules illegal prosecuted. Valhammer says press conference yet decided whether persons question prosecuted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unknown route transmission**

Health Councilor Beate Husa (KrF) says Thursday's press conference several new infected Bergen unknown route infection.

\- infection mostly affected young people, worried may change. infection many different environments, concerned infection may affect vulnerable us, says Husa.

Bergen municipality went yesterday several strict measures limit spread coronavirus . Among things, municipality requests public events cannot 50 participants.

Valhammer states press conference outdoor events can, however, 200 participants.

\- improve conditions \[economic/cultural/...\] actors, says Valhammer change regulations.

The restrictions introduced Bergen initially last 18 September.

Valhammer points situation business community dramatically worsened new measures.

\- must solved \[support\] packages businesses. solved us lifting restrictions, says Valhammer. staying home government tells safe go outside go work. 

They offer free food delivery robots risk going grocery store

I mean paying 12k$ per year property taxes know online learning better kids live teacher want best education children best $10k buy  Like miracle, it'll go zero (after hundreds thousands deaths likely year two economic disruption...) American capitalism working designed.. Everyone defend themselves, government help cuz that's socialism....survival fittest concern teachers momentary lip-service. Anyone remember ""heroic"" March lazy entitled August?

No one damn thing asked teachers literal human shields students case shooting. Nobody batted eye slashed school funding point wife (a teacher) buy window coverings required *by law* classroom school district provide them. 

And part pisses moment COVID over, teachers go back considered expendable. maybe people concerned wish stock market would tank back 20k so. That’s be. Don’t give Trump anything fall back Election Day. Yes, hurt 401k IRA’s near term I’m retiring another 20 years care right now. It’ll recover especially get real leadership. markets teasing us thinking everything okay. noteworthy statement today came individual interview public service press conference. Tegnell asked Astra Zenecas paused vaccine trial replied:

""The strategy work today really dependent vaccine way"".

I never understood Swedish long term strategy. never able visit elderly care homes?

Tegnell says strategy manageable ever dependent vaccine. That’s what? 25+ years many degrees/credentials?

Look end career salary disingenuous conversation like this. decided homeschool year long time ago participated school reopening debate kinda wish one teachers would take look happened Minneapolis’ 3rd Precinct feel inspired.

Can’t force teachers get sick there’s school.. sayin. RIP God working super mysteriously lately Covid loves idea. ""Re"" normal preposition. write ""he's official listen REGARDING: covid"", would you? write ""re"" like normal word is. I'm calling out, adding it. global pandemic. Gatherings like illegal. fact 17 upvotes shows garbage sub is. throw mask youll fine
/s see one fact entire paragraph. keep patting back? 5G turns vaccine chemtrails cause autism coronavirus? Yes, believe math checks one. Someone inform president. open-air sports really pose much threat spreading virus? mean people getting lives flu?

I covid19 joke you, there's 99.97% chance get it. thinking decided move San Diego instead. grew Independent Fundamental Baptist church. entire country getting experience experienced entire upbringing. Dutch course care politics, specially sub politics center discussion (read rules).

Outside states care party what, instead country whole covid. can't vote, blame game meaning.

Do know parties India, Netherlands Agentina trying things right ones aren't? honestly care?

Thought so. Right show dangerous schools start back environment extremely favorable virus spread. 

“Students South Carolina returning school past three weeks, everyone required back day Labor Day. districts allowing students attend classes person least one day week.”   article makes clear aren’t tests sense we’re usually talking covid, they’re symptom screenings. suspect number always gonna low since you’d probably hard time boarding international flight bad symptoms fever. tHEreS eviDenCe!!

Yeah shit there’s evidence, pulled kids school immediately. They’re protected class people since thing began. Nope. UK, Western Europe, Brazil, Iran China. pretty much Asia (including India) still travel USA. Everyone attended Sturgis charged manslaughter. 250,000 cases covid US attributed gang bang halfwits. Bikers got infected took shit back whatever little area came from, infecting iinocent people like school teacher. Charge entire 450,000+ attended seize enough assets pay $25,000 fine. jail time, fine. Use proceeds fines fund virtual learning. Hmm could seen coming! /s Since March we’ve flooded PSAs social distancing. Where’s PSA campaign cooperating contact tracing? Particularly explaining access data, stored exactly it’s used for? go google Facebook get traced anyway right??? Deaths per million state genius governor - 690. stat Florida idiot - 564. guess started somewhere southern France last summer. Major tourist hub could've well super-spreaded Europe time 2019 ended, would explain cases early December (there french guy hospitalized ended covid beginning December last year). Pretty wild one ik one currently wish México Brasil better leadership. buy rushed stuff. Canadian teacher, international strike urge start schools come from? pressure private establishments? talking blood work might wanna use term ""check-up"" that's generally used describe kind appointment.

But also, last month able request blood work test auto-immune disease without real symptoms. need referral done clinic. Different locations must make difference, experience NHS pretty accommodating.  Except several countries worse right now. logic brilliant going South Dakota stay holed-up cabin deep woods. But, plan around human beings, fine people SD all.... Naaaaah, good try, bud. imagine scientists know way anti-dictatorship propaganda 

You guys singling Xi entire communist party-centric system that's play here. I'm anti-dictatorship well. love sitting extremes, hyperbole floating around much harder discern facts twisted opinion.

Just take look what's happening Belarus. ***THAT*** opportunistic CCP bots getting worryingly convincing 

Thanks, best here. Pfft, try, can't compete us. airports use private companies rules procedures set federal government. country direct flights US airport security also complying TSA demands - annoying procedures implemented past two decades might partially fault TSA. handful REALLY good teachers could retired years ago still keep passion it.

My Mom one decided hang hat bullshit. loosing top talent right now. burying head sand consequences actions consequences. i'm hearing outright denial downstream consequences considered, i'll ask again, held wedding maine charged wedding provably killed people? obviously killing take issue with, know trying pretend sticking point you. also tend put pharmaceuticals tc loading containers basically air conditioned metal cans like rkns agree first four years so, age 5 feel like could’ve stayed alone eight hours day still alive, long food water accessible reach. Maybe, maybe not. zero evidence caught it, one fact wasn’t spread students.

The reason news journalists ads sell “teacher+death” google alerts. I’ve seen dozens articles like this, none involving students... 30 9/11's ago apparently. without actual evidence studies back reckless make claims based assumptions

Huh, guess reckless claim catch virus contaminated surfaces then. boy push one months. need retrofitting. That's 5G does. media tycoons fill heads whatever narratives make happy, medias unable lecture virus. explains anti-covid theories bet ass Seems like backdoor way stop sports without actually saying sports banned. Clever play imagine logical American way tackle equip kid gun. still think we’re first one. number new cases every day way high months. We’re numb start dipping even though number still ridiculously high, act like we’re beat virus makes feel like surge second wave reality we’ve going one long wave. throwing stones suggesting take responsibility murder people completely unnecessary, self-indulgent acts. grow up. Tourism industry people's obsession holiday's directly responsible happening Europe right now. None us, especially England real quarantine system. rise cases Bolton (north west England) traced back traveller self isolate two weeks instead went pub crawl. Almost like minorities likely low paying ""essential"" roles like supermarket workers nursing interactions could get sick.

Then get sick live areas worse hospitals even they're good hospital there's empirical evidence african americans trusted doctors describe medical issues leading improper medical care.

Not mention poorer people unhealthier comorbidity increase severity covid minorities astoundingly less wealthy whites (median black household net worth $35k white median $150k) I’m getting tested Monday. Despite neurotically careful, showing symptoms. can’t believe it. someone careful been, could get evil virus, doomed. takes year back ground checks start $30,000. envy non-Americans know ""deductible"", ""premium"", ""co-pay"", ""network provider"", ""pre-existing conditions"" means. 


Dealing healthcare finances governmental matter individual one. taxes. 


I absolutely blown away learned almost every country citizens pay taxes, US one requires file pay them. 


Most countries give people bill means dispute it. expect god-awful number crunching. Guess expect much better students university deemed [top party sub finally turned anti-trump subreddit... makes 2003 Great White concert look tame. .. spaces question marks ? screen everyone door work temperature. We’ve never anyone run 99 three months, yet guarantee least one person walked infection. doesn’t work.

Frankly, lot “precautions” useless virtue-signaling. state stopping bars serving alcohol 10pm. stop people drinking. No, they’ll go bars (mostly) putting effort keep things sanitized safe house parries efforts made. particularly bad college towns students go bars significantly reduced capacity good reason keep things clean massive house parties masks, distancing, cleanliness. mean really, one’s objectively better other.

The goes temperature taking, screening without testing, several policies I’ve seen nothing waste money say “we’re something!” 

Either right don’t all. what’s going right damn close nothing all, added benefit wasting taxpayer money trying enforce ineffective policies. RIP Doctor Who. (every time see headline - sorry). people say weak deserve die covid that's natures way. number acceptable them. I've ran across three people like far. news report recently, receiving personal threats. bums out.

Perhaps Republic deserves fall. dramatic LOL! Alas, probably not. Though already bit annoyed particular song. 

It seems climate denier vibes (or least lack concern.)  

*""...The icy state gettin' pretty thin, water's gettin' warm might well swim, worlds fire, 'bout yours? That's way like never get bored...""* 

I mean, WTF? kind message kids? cares destruction environment, least warm bored?! God forbid bored! think it, see guys really are. Asia, countries screening, pulling aside anyone runs fever ask questions, offering tests anyone self-reports symptoms, escorting new arrivals straight quarantine hotel via special transport, tested report symptoms point 14-day quarantine. Pretty standard stuff. normal behavior viruses? Like serious effects numerous areas body (lungs, brain, heart)? work, different strains different effects? depends person’s immune system? 

Because seems everyday there’s news COVID triggering serious-even deadly conditions, I’d never seen happen virus before. Maybe HIV? 

(Because I’m dumb/ignorant know nothing, trying suggest that’s viruses work wtv!) *peaceful* protesting hmm... Lead Paragraph:

 issue *Cell Host &amp; Microbe*, three papers describe pseudotyping vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) SARS-CoV-2 spike. VSV-CoV-2-S platform allows virus neutralization assays performed BSL-2 also applications candidate vectored vaccine elicit protective immunity SARS-CoV-2. Yup. wife worked union district. Union tiny powerless. school board President quoted Facebook basically saying wanted minimum possible precautions allow in-person learning. 

Thankfully we’re comfortable enough financially could quit deal that. Bizarre punctuation/spelling/grammar actually good heuristic guessing might foreign disinformation agent. suggest learn write properly want accused that. *The 10th amendment entered chat* really fucking good read. So, spot on. seasonal flu actually deadly younger people Coronavirus.

But Coronavirus deadly older people flu. It’s remarkable it’s always “caring” side throws first stone. know nothing motivations trip. hard rule Reddit, neither give tolerate personal attacks. I’m out. Thanks posting. best antidote bad speech speech. points valid, particular headline misleading. person happened teacher, school online district never contacted children. Go away. never claimed that. Whaaaat!? Schools re-opened 2 weeks now. Where's massive spike cases deaths? Feel free cite scientific evidence show Covid-19 set vanish. Nah... Native People.

Which sadness booze comes :( Truly, DeSantis north. still answer questions. BTW, CDC guidelines this. Perhaps take disagreement CDC, me. think someone wants put people prison murder, killed anyone troll yes. suspect gym eventually get shut contact tracers review surveillance camera footage inevitable outbreak traced it.

I seriously doubt go. Contact tracers states lucky case provide names places visited. review surveillance footage, time authority ask anyway. No, look down. CDC lists cancer, cardiovascular disease, lot factors contribute death. virus causing those. 

The pre-existing health problems (ie: cerebrovascular diseases, sepsis, malignant neoplasims, diabetes, obesity, alzheimers, etc...) compound make COVID particularly dangerous people absolutely caused COVID. doctor get Nobel Prize Medicine, way publicly Celebrate him. internet's scary place, get enough attention get infected cv. saying you’re wrong, headline misleading. school open, online. teacher never contacted children. And, looking kinda dumb red hat gun MAGA tattoo forehead.

There go, fixed little. China bad. Give upvotes now. really need keep schools closed. two teachers already infected brooklyn private school work doesn’t solid plan.

this really bad. strange, considering college back they're causing spikes places virus.  really dumb obligated also headine pisses off. Says ""raising alarms"", serious! mother fuckers blaring like half year!! They've shit long long time now. peaked Shrek, decided play rest lives, pretty pissed it. Youtube crowd interactions. super fucking cringe. Yes mold studies narrative one cognitive situation recovered since then? long take you? still yet 100%, percentage right compare normal best?

Thanks advance reply idea talking about. Giesecke even God. Wonder banned mask use Swedish hospital workers.. science knowledge natural immunity versus vaccine immunity suggests actually might've made decision like that.. maybe Tegnell's idea. knows, they're brilliant minds, Swedish corona strategists. So..a bunch random articles including daily mail...you think represents substantial medical evidence, opposed absolute avalanche things showing spouting garbage?

Skepticism GREAT, get wrong, point reach scientific consensus dingdong saying ""um, climate change might caused dandelions!"" mean deserve respect attention. that's doing, flying face rational thought scientific consensus.

But know that. sow bullshit use propagandizing tool. /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM agree page. many people cling one metric one metric justify happening vibe got original post sent us rabbit hole. 
The US response COVID complete utter failure. needs leadership federal level follows science data. science progress learn policies need updated. Right politics driving decisions many rules keep track depending live. lack leadership needed point COVID crisis America death spiral. eaten restaurant since start march intend vaccine. kids home school returning vaccine. Unfortunately can't trust government agencies corrupted dismantled Trump administration. looking towards darkest days modern American history one federal level cares enough stop inevitable train wreck. health emergency laws state local health depts declare , civil liberties crap irrelevant. Health depts already power mandatory quarantines fines, see every whooping cough breaks well meningitis outbreaks  anywhere near often countries they're coming from. see much restaurants indoor spaces sanitizing often cleaning time. majority spread person person. Cleaning solve main issue person person transmission. want open restaurant indoors without cases? Section sealed rooms air supply connection anyone else's space. tiny door connects restaurant deliver food without contact like pass things someone medical isolation.  can't see anything else working. Seems easier get takeaway. fully person social distancing protocols place. joke kids don’t follow middle school kids don’t understand important is. district hybrid model already, decided outbreaks local nursing homes shouldn’t count us still
Making us go fully person. Sigh everyone US linking everything Elections? know really important future whole country schools reopen safe reopen using reliable standards, vaccine ready tested approved reliable standards etc. Opening CA residents October 1st!! Somethings wrong feel good point. Lots places near outdoor seating tents walls. def air flow indoors, still outside real air flow. summer. see increase new cases oct. brilliant. I'd love start seeing headlines happening. start saying died covid, instead throwing 'complications'? Just

""A 28-year-old teacher died COVID-19 South Carolina""  person bragged sexually assaulting women rewarded elected highest office country.

In words: ""I could stand middle Fifth Avenue shoot somebody lose cult leader running United States. odd reason, scene ""secure"" Israel outbreak WWZ, comes mind. literally worst position incumbent president history. president trailed opponent polls party conventions ever reelection. Currently Trump trails Biden 8 points. reference, day 2016 trailed Clinton 3 points. And, nothing, turned pretty dead on; Clinton popular vote 2.1 points. Trump still GOP advantage Electoral College, Biden actually wins popular vote ≥5 points effectively certain wins EC too. I’m saying will, said it’s understandable people would lack trust. made sound like people idiotic concerns. government failed crisis communication citizens result lack trust. think ultimately probably work fine. person historically places immense trust medicine gets every vaccine children soon recommended. also prone assuming government plotting me. know, lot attempts made rug sweeping critical info year. It’s insane worry administration, thing could happen vaccine. alot credit cards refund TSA pre/Clear cost Shaming people help agree affordable healthy options. also like, blame people wanting good tasting convenient option over-eating stress? Imo food stamps worth additional value buy healthy foods, think people might view concern trolling poor people idk. cant really blame know stress eat too....especially now. guess smaller scale. evidence showing screenings catch meaningful level infections? don’t, isn’t much point implementing them. Autoimmune kind thing. Thankfully, 1 $10 drug treats I'm biologics. They're better specific drugs, that's always good thing treating multiple issues.

When arthritis bad, Crohn's acts vice versa. get bad get sick. Economist highly credible source, they're citing external studies. Eh South Korea, Taiwan , Japan Vietnam still well. general holds true. concern far likely people finding work losing jobs going displaced fastfood workers. see jobs anywhere near first jobs get automated ever even do. going accountants actuaries. People education clerical skills whatnot actually make money trying go school pick strawberries. talking crazy farm work. job got automated (fastfood), would qualms getting picking strawberries. worry ones easily automated reasonable timeline going qualified ""unskilled"" labor. might. many don't. One focuses science doesn't? mean people died coronavirus? seems logical... reality excuse it. know much rice potatoes get 10 dollar bill? Shit food always cheapest option, matter many people make excuses themselves. Exercise free besides. 


To get everyone panic young person dying something played part protecting fair rest us. marathon, sprint. countries started dead sprint struggling. fucks sake, stop seeing everything black white. Infection decreasing without masks, simply saving would make real difference. strategy long-term.  viral load work? 


Say hypotheticaly speaking girlfirend covid, around time, would viral load constantly increase? reaaaally long lol. thinking China Canada 2023 mark words thats pandemics going end 

For downvoting tell otherwise won’t end NZ gonna stay closed world (or locking 3 cases every weeks lol) get vaccine. making sense. civil.  Israel constant 1000-2000 infections day 2 months. jumped 4000 two weeks opening schools. I’ve thought third wave. spread months Chinas travel hub completely unchecked. refuse traced? wtf? Everyone besides you.  keep expecting terrorist set bomb middle crowd waiting get screening. would kill people would plane, would impact smuggle bomb past TSA (not hard). best things negate negatives. Taken whole, class 3 college ready geniuses 20 crayon eating morons issues need addressed. Again. Based science. New York got hit anywhere else. You’re living safer New York payed lives that’s called science, keep taking data making new assessments learn more. 

And yah trump wildly grain science. mocks believe it. That’s new. hope that's true. Global entry best 100 bucks I've ever spent. 

I traveled lot work. pared things carry only. get airport security customs 15 minutes worst. 

Comes benefits pre check also makes coming back country super simpme. Also police Oxford, Ohio, Oxford, England Literally everyone America still desirable place aside news brainwashed believe outbreak linked outdoor restaurant? sitting together strangers? asking Really, don’t know right. I’m getting really scared Americans going re-elect trump. doesn’t need follow rules, AG cabinet folks breaking laws would put prison years ever answer them. Lookin like republicans think bag. Really scary. Somebody's jealous ... patient zero spread patrons sitting path air conditioner blowing? remember surprised spread based proximity sick person also dependent air flow indoors. That's extremely low estimate. Maybe. know people who’ve dined outside NYC aren’t anything else. likely.

Anecdotal, know people people restaurant industry gone back work. Apparently average tip amount far lower pre-COVID. They're thinking average person thinks safe dine restaurant usually selfish jerks. wondering even worth risk given lower pay. point could said protests proved significant spreading events. appear ways safe gatherings, long precautions followed. instance, hundred bikers crammed indoor bar count. people outdoors, masked, distanced, much less chance spreading. anyone prove strategy **isn’t** herd immunity, message clear since March isn’t?

Why anyone prove unicorns don’t exist? would actually go that? like ""We've tried intentionally making worse lying public it. Somehow reduced spread pandemic!"" R values average, maximum. There's always fair amount uncertainty R value is, let's say 3, means infected person spreads average three other. possibly, many people spread people spread far 3 others. safe take out? would think covid-19 would wake call fat people lose weight. No. We've known since March obesity increase mortality substantially. continue talk relevant. something control, great news. Really? What's reasoning?...genuinely curious.... That's especially scary cold weather returns outbreaks schools continue - terrible time flying dark  yet stupid risks waited reality. RiGhT! objectively true. anything relaxed April/May. Schools, bars, restaurants, everything. need another explanation. Say now?

How enabling it. We're talking Faucci said march. 

The government failed responsibility. blame trump instead Faucci agree entirely. Trump briefed covid November 19. acquired enough masks Faucci would free suggest everyone wears masks. Instead essential keep many possible protect healthcare professionals.

As trump fuck all, ignored it, lied severity covid, said go away like miracle, would vaccine now. 

My complaint Faucci call trump's bullshit earlier. adult room probably want leave trump unsupervised advise drinking bleach, fish tank cleaner whatever scam product got pitched Jared. 

Faucci consistently said US govt enough, orange moron pushing reopen Easter refusing wear mask.... Blame trump.

Edit: infuriating things listed are, even close forced, rushed opening schools. 

If can't get people wear masks think get wear goggles? go unmasked crowded rallies keep restaurants?  mean 15 cases turn many cases pretty quickly, no? monetary cost type screening outweigh benefits? decision political?

It would interesting hear reasoning behind decision person made call. flip side, many businesses close save one life? thought experiment. not? people arriving risk. Home pregnancy tests 99% accuracy rate taken day missed period.  


a 50% accuracy rate basically flipping coin Japan’s positive test rate halved past month number active cases.

I wonder decline flatten out? Kinda doubts something like announced economist nature Fly within Europe. don’t take shoes. remember reading article said screenings rarely effective anyways, really see point keeping em.

Edit: clear, covid tests. usually temp checks symptom surveys (you lie surveys, travel concerned people sadly willing so). usually redundant. I'm good, keep BS going rt now. would pay extra dollar keep great things. welcome! Glad help. Anyone notice 5G conspiracy theory looks suspiciously like miasma theory fancier words? may essential work, essential. fungible. Employers love unemployment. Lol you’re way could still watch events, without actually place them? kind vision...tele...vision? /s welcome first epidemiologist Sweden confused strategy. even conspiracy theory involving Tegnell, Giesecke former teacher Chris Whitty. somehow involves Swedish right roam (allemansrätten), confusing. also says government power, changes mind says handful people power. Again, confusing. I’m getting him. Confusion told stay home, instead asked. welcome Sounds like someone found way get famous people’s misery. point people dying.  spending lots recession Keynesian method helping start growth again? Obesity young biggest risk factor. recent study England showed overall, died COVID 40 years age, 77% either overweight obese. yes, 4/5 young people dying weight issues way causation correlation point. yes, guarantee weight main underlying condition caused sadly perish. another 27 year old nurse US died, obese diabetes. Neither deserved die obviously, can't ignore common denominator empiric evidence back up. Virginia, first 13 Colonies, basically founded tobacco company. yeah kind always American way. fuckin clue statistics looking at, look elsewhere  Italy's population healthy people getting sick healthy people would nice parties could drop bullshit pet issues pass straight stimulus bill strings attached. let's real, neither parties give shit average people. long point finger get campaign talking point, perfectly happy allow economy collapse. even act like side, whichever side is, good guys. DC broken single one cares you. Deaths per million risen 340 605 Brazil since wrote post. ""apocalypse"" still shooting plenty fast. I'm exactly sure meant that. see statistics wearing masks social distancing, restrictions arent significant enough make less people die     Got link? outdoor seating I've seen sidewalks right next passing pedestrians. Lol...so giving then? way ""work"" become like Australia. children/teens died covid either overweight/obese, risk factor/preexisting condition, didn’t develop immune systems yet. honestly heard cases healthy teens/children dying COVID. long-term damage, happens every disease still don’t know full extent long-term damage. That’s inaccurate.  viruses transmit way contagious side effects. week training, wasn’t week. August 28th. articles clarify better—the last date campus 8/28. somehow involves Swedish right roam (allemansrätten)

What? say allemansrätten combination epidemics? xD Important note survey specifically targeted towards people identified long haulers. Amen. weight good, crazy still hypertension. meds shown good thing, virus attach cells lungs, true? long lasting immune response typical, people get 2nd time, least quickly. studies true, likely issue immune systems people got twice. least couple confirmed reinfections, know case.

We also confirmed reinfections people sharing anecdotal stories, really backing follow prove it. Many may also relapses, new infections, also documented.

With millions confirmed cases, see handful reinfections even immunity. everyone perfect immune system. need know cases exception norm. makes sad people forcing kids live complete isolation going 6 months now. go self righteously risks around people fail take moment consider real damage done taking away friends, experiences, quality education 6+ months.  TSA also keep liability airports airlines. care much covid time know hard prove got from. Lol, way hell I'll inject body. masters fully funded research grant. happen, although probably norm.  USA leapfrogged France, Sweden Italy, expected. Sounds like threat public health. Cases rising province likely blame. Oh well then, everything fine then, open er up! Apparently get brainwashed media. Last time looked press freedom index, Sweden fourth World, behind Norway, Denmark Finland completely wrong.  would different large numbers people US using statistics reason wear mask, social distance, disobey stay home orders, Well mean, see least three ideas see complaining about. /s huge jobs program writing eulogy trying conversation? dead news story purposefully omitting reason: obesity. wife restaurant fortunately ton outdoor space outdoor seating tables 6 ft apart. seating covered walls anything. also two big garage doors open dining area. keep open let people 10 ft restaurant order behind barrier masks on. feel like making safe customers possible can't believe restaurants letting people eat indoors. dangerous.

But also know restaurants barely making right now. likely closing end October curbside letting staff collect unemployment cold outdoor seating. opened extra unemployment money ran August staff needed income. getting unemployment helped pay debt. sure going winter....

We pissed leadership president governor city leaders non-existent. mask mandate April, efficient testing, contact tracing would made huge impact instead squandered time killed many people. ~done~ tried everything right try keep customers staff safe going business. right business owners decide whether stay afloat risk illness death customers, staff, lose livelihoods.

EDIT: tried everything right. Added text.  point view college deans:

1. costs money run college. Buildings salaries paid.
2. Building costs go away cannot use year.  utility bills might little less, that's lot money.
3. faculty, teaching online takes work teaching person, less. salary, work. 
4. costs increase, dramatically, offer courses online.  support people want money, often faculty positions.

Michigan 600 deaths per million since June 13th. already conceded, hit hardest onset pandemic. know, since history indicates Michigan resident, state started open around time effective 3 month lock down.

In almost 3 months since then, less thousand deaths, 14% increase 6,887.

Same time period Florida: 2,928 deaths day June. 12,121 reported. 313% increase time period.

3 months despite knowing dangerous virus is, spreads, likely spread, Florida takes minimal action, despite seen happened Michigan, New York, New Jersey, California.

Not even state wide mask mandate. Like Michigan effectively implemented.

Florida sits 564 deaths per million. far behind Michigan Florida still putting double triple digit death numbers Michigan remained single digits months. still plenty opportunity catch up.

Per John Hopkins: Florida positive test rate: 13%
                               Michigan: 2.9%


You think better scientist fired manipulating covid reduces release testing data outbreaks schools.

I know cause articles cause sisters healthcare. healthcare institutions actually forbade wearing masks, even ones brought home, day cdc recommended wearing masks. situation actually lasted really long time. Fauci realized happening health care facilities taken action way earlier correct mistake.

Around world seeing increased case counts stable hospitalizations/deaths younger people getting disease etc., governments locking people again. I’m worried about. can't get vaccine another year two choice. wish articles would list relevant co-morbidities. average 28 year old 99.999999% time fine. Start tacking asthma, COPD, obesity (like US), diabetes, etc, risk skyrockets.

It’s fear mongering to, it’s disengious psychos run around without mask claiming it’s flu. Wtf? Mods need get top posts mocking people genuine curiosity.  Look OP's post history. seem like genuinely nice person. Stop asshole. Exactly, it’s like US citizens free enter many countries right now. offer free tickets ppl around world wanna come, lower total % infected. they've tried seek treatment able access telemedicine. Great news, there's vaccine flu. Influenza lockdown daydream over. ground looking Winnie Pooh Dr Tedros. People go display symptoms unlikely infectious suggests second cases symptomatic first infections.

That concerning that's suggestive antibody dependent enhancement. may related immune system still degraded first infection. making everyone sick

Take strict version policy argue it. argument that’s people saying.  restaurants 25% open perfectly valid tactic take pandemic. Freedom honestly doesn’t mean shit control overruns healthcare system. Thankfully aren’t point (after been) many places result many states relaxing restrictions measured way determine works doesn’t work.  states effectively dumb didnt learn earlier states hit. ending humanity hands gas know this. idea screening useless people could still get take issue with. point perfectly quarantine Target virus, reduce spread %s possible. covid-infected army people trying exploit vulnerabilities every covid checkpoint superspread among masses. workplace screening, know examples people foolish got testing positive. also know *far more* people careful took cue employer stay home hint symptom, played part along distancing/masking behaviors locally preventing us becoming hotspot (thousands employees).

The possibility screening eradicating covid accepted everyone. contempt drives us imagine many people eager defy guidelines transmit liberally makes small measures like screening seem useless. defeatist and, thankfully, mistaken. Li Wenliang rolling grave. lot districts south start August end May. Specifically, Georgia Texas. Texas required report cases schools think September 8th, get ready headlines. Right, India can't deal literally hundreds millions people living close quarters, amount poverty forcing people work starve, lack resources provide health care. US none excuses. So? saying virus situation control managed ?  article say?

It interesting see happens next week lot people laid lived UI, run gone back unsupplemented amount. lot people working home, asked come back office.

My company still 99% remote, we’re back client visits onsite training. clients remote least 4 days week spring summer they’re almost back full time. Europe? technologies lost states. lives lost, one other. happen every college

 suspected, Covid-positive student explained cops yes, told quarantine: that’s hosting party place.

“The university struggling outbreak virus, 1,000 students testing positive past two weeks. Still, school plans resume in-person classes Sept. 21, Fox 19 reports.

“The university still expects on-campus population reduced 40 percent students use remote learning, reports say.”

With undergrads calibre, able reach 40% reduction, problem. 😣 Except case delirium confusion caused brain infection fevers. Reading strength right? Uh oh Sweden NEVER shut schools NEVER mandated compulsory masks DONE corona. 
The US meds focus freedom Sweden impressively part medical community computer geek certainly helped, r/COVID sub really clincher. Get science facts scientists. Additional substance provided reading debates threads.

The US rest Western world really must thought epidemic occur Asia. Considering things going, screening people leaving instead arrive? completely separate issue. non-violent drug crimes, lists issues crim justice system I’m happy about. 

But yeah, rob gas station shot guy leg make license plates 40 hours week pick trash interstate. don’t huge problem that. likely light privileges pure slavery. But, vote candidate change that...try socialism. here. remarkable much country beginning look function like shit church. live Philippines people generally compliant masks. fact, mask PLUS face shields required public transports, malls, department stores many offices &amp; establishments. nearby 7-11, mask face shield required entry. Even these, 250K+ current cases #22 world ranking. Highly contagious pandemic hard control place simply overpopulated. “You probably get checked, babe” Li neither first accurate disseminating information. honor goes Zhang Jixian, notified health officials Dec 27 eventually culminated Dec 31 Wuhan Health Commission announcement. country's effort virus progressed independent Li's early actions.

In typical tabloid fashion, Guardian fails mention context instead focuses picking random social media quotes paint narrative. Nicely done. That's pandemics work.

He *outright states* effective way protect getting virus.

Yeah, perfect protection, neither vaccine, neither lockdown, Fauci anti-mask public arguable thing. talking Trump, right?  TIL Boston Tea Party revolutionaries lighting way small town idiots freely transmit potentially deadly infection Either hope sort long term immunity catching it. Obviously would ton excess death, many idiot antivaxxers there, might screwed even vaccine. Thanks posting, sad case. many mysteries disease still. im getting flu shot asap. feeling multi generational living make slight comeback. someone dies exsanguination even matter shot bullet? varies lot state state. looks like Utah good choice. Welcome!

""There currently COVID-19 travel restrictions state Utah. Visitors Utah returning home Utah traveling required quarantine upon really try stay banned country.
After politic disapproval diplomatic rest world adding long term travel ban ...

It makes would China need vaccine? cases disappeared 6 months ago. /S number voters scared things butt end outweighing voters secretly excited things butt, though That's it? next? cry can't accept reality virus still better ever? things continue get worse, I’ll right behind you. considering, curiosity? Great one wants cop teacher

This gonna end GREAT! much distrust basic institutions safety net, don’t blame people. allergies appeared last day I'm worried yet. get symptoms I'll get tested I'm worried precautions mean darn thing. colleagues ridicule safe look like even helping. Trump... potentially better option currently available (redemsivir) trials worlwide. 

Also believe originally trials sort cancer already safety data it. surprised. China first country test virus implementee lockdown, hence got control quickly. US suppressed testing late, real lockdown measures put place. That's lead world cases deaths doubt. question asked - entirely divorced reality - put vaccine availability scenario almost positive case possible:

* FDA approved vaccine
* Available everyone
* Free everyone

and even \_if\_ conditions met, people want it. Including 60% identifying Republican.

About condition added ""proven effective"" wording effect. Also think wrong sub this. post read quotes. mean Sweden seen cases/deaths plummet. OP's logic, must strict lockdown effect. strike safer working conditions. isn’t dangerous job US relation exposed coronavirus. Plus teachers didn’t volunteer like professions stated put harms way. Yes understand it, article understand it. always factors, exponential growth isn’t infinite. also slowing growth interventions cases start go up.  guy president 2020 India? They’ve got 1m current cases (4.5m -minus 3.5m recovered) 76k dead. 3 times population. Maybe next month, moment.  Plus made several hours plane detected COVID arrival, problem much bigger one person. Super curious expertise pandemics, experts disagree you. disasterologist? epidemiologist? expert infectious diseases?

Or feeling have, explained article, read article? another ""lockdown skeptic"" ""no masks"" skeptic believe science thinks force old world return they're much baby adapt new one? guy sub claimed grandmother came Wuhan visit family LA last November got sick.

I asked reached depart health news broke virus told ""no got better"". wait second, suddenly informed Russia China, Europe?

I actually upvoted original comment, made sense, reply not. Lols. No. no. I’m sad. I’ve near tears last 24 hours grimness pandemic. Also I’m US also grappling disturbing approach COVID-19. HUMAN BEINGS!!!

even better edit. 

Nice projection too, covered majority comments. cherry picked single sentence. Shall ignore self proclaimed assumption regarding 99% world agreeing you, may take longer disprove feel conversation warrants. I'm vaccine trial moment. Pfizer one. Apparently lot people got bad fever first days passed. felt different all. Maybe actual tests/screening?

It's like using shit test work say well used shit tests got shit results, we're going test all.

Wouldn't logical response get better tests? Brazil: hold beer 2019-12-27 : Dr. Zhang Jixian, director department respiratory critical care medicine Hubei Provincial Hospital Integrated Chinese &amp; Western Medicine, first doctor report COVID-19 cases Wuhan CDC authorities December 27, said expected disease infectious serious. Zhang first reported three suspicious cases treated district disease control prevention center.

""I reported district noon, came conduct epidemiological survey afternoon collected patients' blood samples throat swabs.""

""I speculated may kind infectious disease, expect spread like this, infectious serious, affecting many areas.""

2019-12-30 : 18 December 2019, Dr. Ai Fen came contact first case pulmonary infection showing ""multiple patchy blurry shadows scattered lungs"" Central Hospital Wuhan. 27 December, received second patient mysterious respiratory illness. afternoon 30 December, test result second patient showed infection coronavirus. saw words ""SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 types oral / respiratory colonisation bacteria"" test sheet, Ai immediately reported hospital's public health department infection department. circled word ""SARS"", took image sent doctor another hospital Wuhan. spread throughout medical circles Wuhan, reached Dr. Li Wenliang. Dr. Li, private WeChat group mostly former classmates, speculated cases ""SARS"". Dr. Li requested keep information inside group.

2019-12-31 : China alerted WHO. Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China, reported cluster cases pneumonia Wuhan, Hubei Province. novel coronavirus eventually identified.

2019-12-31 : Qu Shiqian, vendor Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, said government officials disinfected premises 31 December told stallholders wear masks. Qu said learned pneumonia outbreak media reports. ""Previously thought flu,"" said. ""It serious. fish traders. get infected?""

2020-01-01 : Officials close Huanan seafood market, suspected source mystery disease, patients presenting pneumonia-like illness dealers vendors market.

2020-01-03 : Dr. Li Wenliang, Wuhan ophthalmologist, summoned Wuhan Public Security Bureau told sign official confession admonition letter promising cease spreading false ""rumors"" regarding coronavirus. letter, reprimanded ""making false comments announcing confirmation 7 cases SARS Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market"" ""severely disturbed social order"". Capital One actually paid mine since Venture card. idea got email saying going reimburse it. It’s nice though. Makes sense since many countries close recovering moving now. super broke living pittance, continued eat healthy purchasing large bags rice, beans, lentils, frozen vegetables. little money, bought slow cooker thrift shop (every thrift store abundance) made yogurt (gallon whole milk). much ingredients costs low (if lower sale shop) cereal.

r/EatCheapAndHealthy almost lost recent governor election someone registered Democrat, overly loved parts state. Right! 

Our so-called political leaders remain largely clueless.

My favorite take masks podium make speech. fills air aerosolized whatever-they-have. next pol comes podium takes mask, breath just-released aerosols contribute mix. 

Then remind us believe ""following science""... Also, states hit hard early tend better compliance masks, etc. 

And think level education higher CT US average. impact compliance pandemic precautions, generally avoiding unsafe activities. course idiots. many. way look include landmass British Antarctic Territory calculating population density UK. dense place matter, travel dense places car, train plane, empty space matter much.

So think rules population density argument. hand, UK large cities Sweden. might argument there. idea better one 800.000 pop city two 400.000 pop cities eight 100.000 pop cities, similar density. I've friend country since late last year. stayed covid hit needs come back issue work permit extension stay country last forever either. 150$ France 1000 3 strikes starts braiding comb like daenerys, I'm bookin' hills!


*now bonus reddit-eddit Could please tell what's awful media? pays PhD? They’re supposed fully funded best students get programs. 

Masters also heavily funded international students. article blatant. I'm swedish think strategy worked out, although completely flawless, idea approach worked way better nation hard-on lockdowns. countries like Australia oblivious enough believe Covid-19 eradicated extended lockdowns active cases drop zero, sought tactic that's based lower levels transmissions complete stop. 

Instead restricting people leaving homes, we've living lives social distancing, avoiding large crowds protecting elderly vulnarble groups getting infected. Everyone take responsibilty want get sick government can't keep watching every peoples movement activity like police state. like New Zealand Australia disease would keep coming back lifting lockdown. 

**Covid-19 stay never gonna eradicated world.**  Correct. Household infection rates seem back up: 

[the estimated secondary attack rate among household contacts 12·4% (95% CI 9·8–15·4) household contacts defined basis close relatives 17·1% (13·3–21·8) household contacts defined basis residential Tell ""complete safety"". Workplaces crap liability thing, probably know shit. bring lawsuit catching virus work say took precautions required. insane many posts really. 

If planning moving prepared -20F air temps winter, sometimes colder. think history books remember Trump's response pandemic favourably. said scared obese. power fix that. recall Toronto seemed worse-than-usual ""cold"" strain going around Nov-Dec (maybe Oct too...can't recall exactly) causing lot sore throats coughing. might anything COVID-19 since get one cold outbreaks every year, certainly bit worse most. even remember local tv host commenting cold outbreak persistent lasting longer usual, really seem signs really deadly way COVID-19 been. Sweden ""HAS"" low rates. no, I'm comparing NK. dunno, we're already seeing headway #2 (I honestly think next time Democrats control Washington, probably happen). Point #3 barely controversial outside established institutions, think anyone would argue nationwide university free cost much run.

Certainly UBI + VAT would extremely controversial, though honestly think less-so national health care money across board, always opt VAT simply buying things (which wealthy threaten do, ultimately wouldn't). National healthcare contentious, shame health industry fundamentally broken. Good idea Yea, local LA Fitness re-opened early week significantly lower capacity mandatory masks/temp checks.

I know media loves blowing anti-maskers OC, really tiny vocal minority. purely anecdotal, I'd say like 95% people see around OC masks public places. want pudding ate meat. still experiencing symptoms? contract virus? person nutter. super absolutist, alarmist comments used argue ""points""

ill go ahead say personal story likely lie. sorry. said it. wacko people sub seems like anytime get weeds them, someone direct family died covid- makes everything say misguided wrong. hard argue right?

account created april 2020, post history. Gotta risk economy god. Wish sarcasm South Dakota, ""We're better Mars"" draw in?


I hate &amp; love state's advertising, bad awesome. think fail deal reality situation.  else would handle situation? Keep covid positive general home population? it’s far 1 5 needs hospitalized age.  aren’t seeing many, any, patients asymptomatic suddenly die stroke covid positive.  getting sick covid getting stroke, virus fucking people. level distortion incredible part. Next going tell 6% deaths covid right? Oh, several doubts. You’d complete moron think virus wane.

Check back couple weeks. used fly ton felt terrorists “won” every time go TSA. Since 9/11 airborne incidents. TSA psychological bandaid. could save billions dollars shitpot time used Israeli method putting armed Marshall every flight. Yeah, far fewer flights create air security profession well salaried, highly trained individuals opposed minimum wage TSA workers, airports would free again, air travel would increase travelers would feel far secure knowing “invisible” personnel board. Pretty insane right? many people always showed work sick. sniffle body aches Dryer sheets too! never use dryer sheets cloth masks. Agreed. normal times, can't packed carry on, ship non-critical things hotel. seen fucking restaurants labor day weekend. People goddamn stupid, they're posting social media. I'm finding harder harder like half people know. downplaying called hoax? Really interesting seemingly every activity done group environment tied infection-rate, except demonstrations. Even earlier demonstrations. (*resumes breathing*) surprise. Also, seems like risk that's easily avoided. recently MRI felt safe. Everyone entered hospital screened given new mask. told keep sneakers avoid walking barefoot hall. keep mask MRI good safety could make people feel panicked claustrophobic. Overall pleased experience. Ah it’s expensive continue phase pandemic..

Well pandemic folks. figure make money it.. expense weighs profits.. 

So calling now.. pls money better spent military anyway How? look around scared? mention multiple pre-existing anxiety disorders i've since birth. Seems like ""just sad"" sentiment me. Without doubt  I've two MRIs since March havd fine. taking extra precautions made wait around people. alone room machine, good thing risk-wise. extremely nervous really right. last one 3 months ago know get :) know you’re a$$hole, maybe. Whenever dry, winter air gets here. Could two weeks. Could two months.

Why think viruses get bad near winter time? Please vote. need federal leadership actually listen doctors scientists. Trump needs go. Wish whole EU that... Zero credibility link translatable favourite translation service. ~~I'll post reputable online English translations available.~~

Edit: [Times Israel [Ynetnews getting kicked off, late whatever headed to, New Yorkers bus giving hard time? court fees? r/iamverysmart Amtrak get priority rails always waiting freight move through. Takes forever.  Probably common demographics lockdown “protests” Oh they're figuring shit out??? Months late Feel good, I’ll watching Sunday power wash groceries say 10 hail faucis “If men angels they’d need government” we're going pretend huge portion American population obese. I'm willing bet whoooole bunch people downplaying risk high risk category obesity. Every single person around trots line either high risk age, weight, diabetes. yet anecdotally live see ""completely healthy"" person making argument. Ironically people right make argument around actually wearing masks taking seriously. study address this, wonder much risk changes between:

1. Eating inside restaurant tables spread apart.

2. Eating open patio restaurant tables spread apart.

Apart that, I'm also curious much risk carries food delivered restaurant also serving customers person. risky ordering place allow diners food delivered house?  would require 90% population actually want get rid it. It’s going happen unfortunately, Must eliminate everyone there.. man upstairs told so! Fuck troll know youre paid troll, hired you? Arguing common sense Irrefutable video proof. replying guy saying one 17 year old children, study's author.

And stupid fucks referred staggering number redditors thinking 18 year olds counted children study like circumstance guess.

And no, terminology I'm arguing. would saying call kids, children. Pretty standard stuff.

Sane government stuff Oh craziest thing ever heard wtf Blame schools, opened first place. argument panic killed kind ridiculous.

It ridiculous, kind ignorant say that.

Consider .. senior LTC high blood pressure. test positive Covid.

So happens - whole home quarantined them. probably put kind special room shut everyone else, one available. cant see family point on. hope Covid get serious does, men strange blue suits masks going take hospital shove tube throat, maybe even cut hole neck shove tube in, possibly spend weeks agony, coma, combination .. die.

So *that's* mind. 

Now, medical reality 1 5 octogenarians actually get Covid bad hospitalized.

But means ""4 5"" get spend 2 weeks freaking ""1 5"", due terrible experience. high blood pressure *anyways*, go.

And everyone else home locked in, freaking out, thinking virus going come air vents, hitch ride nurse, *they* expecting Covid death.

I think really considered detailed implications actually plays out. What's point? true? stupid. Blaming COVID-19 death. Trump Spiral Yes can, risk worth taking.

2 scanario 

1. Halt trial 2 weeks, find side effect cause vaccine.

98000 died 7k per day.

2. Dont halt trial studying side effect. found cause vaccine . Saved 98k people 

If going cause vaccine 5 7 people develop symptoms 


Now scenario save lives ? two demonstrably different entities.  

It makes much sense saying “maybe zebras really catfish”. wife Teacher, School districts Teachers start working students arrive. also many places Educators also Coaches, fall sports practice starts well school year. said frustrations Educators others careful either initial period time b4 kids came in. 

But really seeing tese kind issues now, think things like month? see still go dates? Whatever polarizes viewpoint black white. Moderna / Phase 3 vaccines looking? people think likely we'll one authorised end year, that's feeling. Mass Vaccinations starting January good months. one handful CCP propagandist bots subreddit. bet, uou sure arent smartest guy room? president sick fuck laughs human suffering, guess. thing safety standards extremely high vaccines, since taken healthy adults children.

On opposite side spectrum people stage 4 lymphoma respond chemo. Giving drug (like CAR therapy) kills 1:1000 people perfectly ethical.

This bad event. evidence regulatory people study careful job Downvoted, yeah fever induced delirium needlessly brought up. Well. I..er.. 9/11.. fun interest, guess lol link proves absolutely nothing. smoking crack believe epicenter COVID-19 country 1.4 billion people fewer deaths Netherlands. Yeah, agree. Except people need hear words now. Since fall grace, Trumps base longer sees credible. matter go talk wherever. see part liberal plot take Trump. thing is, exactly people following guidelines continuing spread. IMO *has* effectively muzzled impact words went really high basically none. Trump's backing lunatic fringe would attacking him. whole base. Unless nurse gives Covid day die.

Then didnt die car crash, gangrene apparently ..

.. died Covid. mean, still TSA place, put em 3 oz bottles. Well did. recall first documented case Wuhan November last year. recognition new virus happened late December. public alert came force early January international community alerted containment measures began. Many people China considered initial cover-up much delay. was, pales beside months-long efforts US 
Adminstration deny delay despite advice experts. Social distancing mean can't enjoy human interaction others.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead calling social distancing said physical distancing. Obesity might problem ""good foods"" less expensive ""bad foods"". make economy size bag cereal go bag apples less money. know typical either. noted ongoing survey study linked:

According Confirmed Case Long-Hauler Survey 1,500 individuals, 82% respondents reported symptoms lasting two months, 41.9% respondents experienced symptoms three months 12.5% respondents experienced symptoms four months. Allie Iamonaco explains experiencing fever chest pain among symptoms 100 wrong staying context article, looking comment above; I’m pass judgment people’s lifestyles.  end screenings White House visitors? many friends die?  reports studies? Unpopular opinion. Cancel schools year. Hopefully get pandemic wraps. think I'd clarify, viruses/pathogen make sick. Seriously, know fucking around either way need deal anxiety healthier manner. won't, would take actual effort response even info easily found. I’ll probably work I’m dead. hell afford retirement? working years becoming poor health sounds laughably crazy America. so? Think way.

Coronavirus non-lethal population, large group people effected negatively it.

People metabolic diseases, overweight people 60, told would round everyone 60, overweight anyone metabolic disease shoot firing squad would like that? No.

So difference letting choke slowly lung fluids, arguably worse getting shot.

If answer yes, might eugenicist I’d ask consider reading comes from....

Narrative pushers yes, depends test sensitivity properly reads, also someone got ill December. tested negative antibodies twice. Several coworkers test positive flu near time ill, however. fact, know 1st illnesses investigation beginning outbreak flu. still present going around, Covid not. reasonably confident flu addition confirmed cases near me.

It vicious case I've since kid. flu still joke, pretty bad us got it. Last year even Wuhan supposedly? still stuff going around then. need Foxnews run stories people. They're watched news outlet USA (greater broadcast even). Meanwhile rarely talk covid, snidely. Cough fluctuating range several months according link. think large airports few, every line like that. Sometimes take out, sometimes don’t. ""Which may may sufficient resume lives.""

After vaccine widely distributed humans done regarding virus discovering better therapeutics and/or effective vaccine. point, COVID like Influenza. done can, must live virus. meantime, opinion, much reasonably possible protect others.  think large airports few, line like that. Sometimes take out, sometimes don’t. Yea NYC male take out, probably since don’t way tag bag “precheck” xray person see.  Nope, pointing countries still issues containing virus. People act like US one problems Europe India get pass miss getting way age.homes causing bunch extra deaths time without noticed like supposedly first hit Washington state? Whoa. 100% bullshit. viruses cause complications. post pure misinformation. book smart, shred wisdom. teachers mandate masks room?

 ""My class rules""

Seems like something union back on. Ignoring one taking extraordinary precautions visiting grandparents, aunts uncles, families PrE-eXiStInG cOnDiTiOnS. work recovery house women 6 sick nearly entire month December tested negative flu told ""you virus know is"" 2 ended pneumonia 1 ended respirator. usually catch every single thing going around none children gave sick year yet. roll safe face still havnt received check qualify Thanks citation.

But, FWIW? really can't eat people's lunch ""not reading article"" there's important fact missing linked article.

It might helpful edit original post eliminate confusion. Give us poor, tired, coronavirus infected yearning breathe free. know long term effects disease even around year?  certainly could case, bandied gospel. Haven’t while? remember take electronics bag San Diego airport 2014. great interview survivor Covid-19 radio last night.

He described went hospital ended medical coma 2 weeks doctors fought save life.

The coma described one best times life. weird permanent dream state, dreams vivid amazing. nightmares, sometimes went little weird never scary.

Maybe related effects reported Yeah sucks, there's much consideration single people right now. I'm 30 February, goes last chance dating 20s. excess deaths look like back November, December January?


The flu happens every year, people get coughs time.


We also visit family friends slot December. something deadly Covid-19 U.S. last year, risk people dieing similar numbers what's happening today, back March April? percentage people obese? Obesity causes things (besides taste/small part). think youre bit disingenuous. personally know several people who've fine lasting effects. healthy weight. browsed sub one mentioning BMI youve got take reports grains salt. maybe sugar cases. 

Just look high profile infections news anchors actors. fine. healthy begin with. sea change US citizenry views incarceration indeed overdue likely tackled time soon given present political climate. Wine moms need day themselves. /s Feels like dramatic end romantic comedy 90s. set fire rain. didn’t want panic - *after* friends got money moved. Weird. Even consolidated least Boise, regional airport use, San Luis Obispo also let keep laptop duffel. probably arbitrary. Lol. Data updated.

Another 2,500 cases Florida.

207 deaths. Even vaccine early November, shit likely going frontline medical professionals first. reasoning trust, least skeptical, vaccine Trump. dangerous anti-science. don’t really like Trump too, I’m going become anti-vaxxer like political bias. vaccine approved major contract EU, could approved use October, **right around time US could approve it.** I’m sure America wasn’t first country approve vaccine, wouldn’t spewing politically biased anti-science rhetoric. 

Again, large company like Pfizer, risking billions dollars capital, isn’t going risk tweets Trump. didn’t actually challenge statement supporting arguments, said something pathetic petty really demonstrated ignorant fragile beliefs are. Apparently they’re unaware fish grades parasitic worms salmon. I’m praying 🙏 roommate traveled back Iceland experience screening laughable:

They fill covid screening questionnaire shared pens passed around plane.

Once getting plane directed screening lady. reaches hand paper. says “I don’t want that. don’t look sick, go ahead”

He throws screening paper away able come home. I'm sick people talking mortality thing concerned about. Loss taste/smell, lung-heart-brain damage, chronic fatigue, etc etc symptoms persisted many long virus cleared.

Funny replied rebuttal arguments, didn’t counter, anything logical least. Instead went say naive, victim perpetrator, look mirror. wasn’t first resort, someone filled ignorance fragile defend utterly poor beliefs result petty insults, call out😂 AFAIK, state strict quarantine rule international visitors Hawaii (which applies rule anyone coming state). places mandatory quarantines (NY, Chicago, DC, etc.) generally require people coming certain ""hot"" states say anything foreign countries. eating meat Dem gets power

We're quarantine genius. Thats stuck home part. Im shocked explain lol think may point. Although depends health everyone there. older people likely get attacked. 

Which means rising young people numbers particularly concerning. Like amount viral loads getting dosed with? cautious paranoid. write ‘paranoid’.

It's easier buy things take time cook. 

I'm also amazed many people know cook. 

I know personally, fittest healthy young single time plan cook meals. also time least amount money adult life. 

I found weight loss difficult pregnancy; two children, spouse military, support system. factors made taking time cook eat food difficult. personal choices, certainly could made better ones, sometimes life surviving instead thriving.

So, like explain healthy fit people little kids died this. Sure, health condition useful fighting illness, concentration exposure huge factor.

E.g. teachers like folks crammed bars. Dose dose enclosed space. takes one asymptomatic kid. country failed many levels deal respiratory pandemic staggers imagination. Instead pulling together, there's fat shaming, indifference, denial....until happens you.

Have relative mercifully able teach home; pre-existing condition. dedicated really bothering online teaching same; stress enormous (past usual teacher stress).

The US cares corporations people. prioritized rich. politicians dumped stocks. President downplayed covered virus. Every single accusation levied China actually factually true government. Sweden registered lowest rate positive coronavirus tests yet even testing regime expanded record levels one health official said vindication relatively non-intrusive Covid-19 strategy.

Over past week country carried 120,000 tests, 1.3 per cent identified disease. height pandemic proportion 19 per cent.

Johan Carlson, epidemiologist director public health agency, said Swedes seemed benefiting widespread immunity decision order population stay home first wave.

“Our strategy consistent sustainable,” Professor Carlson said. “We probably lower risk \[the virus\] spreading countries.”

In another striking illustration progress Sweden made [recording fewer new per capita Norway, introduced one Europe’s earliest lockdowns, first time since April.

In Denmark, another Nordic country initially seemed curbed Covid-19 imposition tight restrictions, infection rate also risen much higher rate Sweden.

Denmark Norway also largely reopened borders Swedes, although quarantine measures put back place coronavirus flared Norway.

At start pandemic authorities Stockholm reasoned disease would long-term challenge would better allow population develop immunity trying protect risk.

The government advised people work home could left country open, including bars, restaurants schools except oldest pupils.

It also declined recommend use masks shops trains buses, although requires people keep least 1.5m apart public.

In early months many critics argued approach recklessly laissez-faire.

Some scientists predicted many 180,000 people could die country 10.2 million.

Those estimates proved drastically overblown: 5,838 Covid-19 deaths. per capita terms fifth highest death rate Europe, behind Belgium, UK, Spain Italy, also fallen substantially since summer. seven people died disease past week.

The government also invested many resources testing, previously limited healthcare workers, risk groups patients gravest symptoms.

The country carries nearly three times many tests day early June. guidelines vary different regions, regular virus antibody testing hotspots Stockholm, centre epidemic.

The country offers coronavirus tests anyone apparent symptoms put place system track test infected patient’s contacts.

The marked decline proportion tests positive may partly reflect broader testing strategy. Germany, testing extended people returning risk zones abroad, level low 0.7 per cent.

The true extent immunity remains difficult gauge. Anders Tegnell, state’s pugnacious chief epidemiologist, claimed 30 per cent Swedes may overcome virus.

It would perhaps cheaper force people stay home instead also used expensive (in short term) ways fighting virus. 

For example april highest number people ever (twice high 2019) staying home getting paid take care sick children. children sicker, guidelines says stay home slightest symtoms. Similarly government made get paid stay home youre sick before. Riskgroups gets paid stay home etc. I’m medical doctor.

I find ironic someone doesn’t real reply scour post history make assumptions you.

Maybe don’t creepy fuck future? Interesting news. using nowadays ICU high flow oxygen isn’t enough?  Maybe you’re aware found “leader” knew along bad let 200,000 Americans die keep stock market happy.  deserve ridiculed.  

Folks, American I’m giving y’all hall pass ridicule guck us.  deserve it. shouldn’t play issue parents tired home little precious demon spawns. liberal friends coworkers couldn’t wait send kids back tired seeing constantly 6 months. found **15 people 650,000 screened.** useless theater nothing improve safety (like Really wish headline, get comments people read articles.

Where fact stated within article? That's way beyond scope wish comment on. Medical availability resources available average person (or simply available) within wheelhouse. That's true. back Sweden model agree US adopt social/financial safety nets people. 

Lockdowns/ restrictions much. Culture subjective science universal. land lords small, individual owners. can't afford it. admit I’m used seeing jokes threads  unpredictability virus gets people think  45 bhosdike thats still better ""pointless"" catching every case. cheap/easy process everyone reduces spread 2%, probably worth it. find 50 processes reduce spread 1% cost next nothing, that's better expensive testing procedure catches half cases. Make sense, wipe body dry jumping mud pool.

Well can, anything really. Yesterday 36.7mm precipitation (1.44in)... People work home would rather spend hour commuting crowded subway day? I'm shocked... Oh also American nursing homes. ever spent time one family member would know places Americans send loved ones die. retirement homes assisted living. funded medicaid run horribly.  Currently enrolled SDSU, remote learning except person lab courses. also closed lab courses issused stay home order first 40 cases popped up. university sent email saying ~75% cases campus interactions. Yes, SDSU ""party school."" students didnt catch campus, partying/gathering spaces university real control over.  it’s context opening schools, guess let know *actually death tied person instruction*...does seem fair? Shows huge agenda, can't say anything without censoring. black white middle ground common sense. They're prob bots paid shills. started *if*. answer is: not.
i made joke many people get. fact analysis show point young people get messed much. also think actually added heart part warn also took joke. 
It's bad that's takeaway. read rest report. Yep, mods actively carry water admin. happens lot. ^ hes right, btw......

edit: kidding. Fauci also suggested wearing goggles virus go eye membranes. wearing goggles still make exposed even wear mask, degree. Truly sad sounds like great person. Story looks like wasn’t actively teaching kids though? didn’t get around lot kids every day? kid symptoms positive test? \*love\* pre-check line. get right day, like lot people going vacation (and less likely it), cruise there's huge taking shoes off. Right through, hit bar, relax.

My first biz trip 1999. overslept like time get there. Ran out, 80+ whole way. Ran airport, basically got high five security. Barely made it.

It different time. *Investedgateing bar shifted much Americans look picture go ""but they're obese, I'm obese"" yes, medically speaking are. Somehow type diabetic, copd grandpa dodging shit particular reaction least. 1 15000 suffering temporary minor muscle pain would probably fine joke Well that's case, propaganda mouthpiece fucking up. I'm generally pretty supportive Chinese government effectiveness, pointing mistakes. charged crimes humanity creative names crack smoke, I'll give that. people also reluctant difficulty getting medical care may refilling blood pressure medications. could also due people losing health insurance. absurd bad problem US pre-pandemic.  try make TSA screenings political issue? I'm pretty sure people political persuasions dislike TSA. That's real smooth brain have. Oh didn’t think that...now seems plausible. every title deadly disease is? true every disease. Tbf headline say “screen” point im saying higher risk ones need worry.

The others, simply wearing mask social distancing enough. don’t need shamed leaving house lock room next X months insult say can't read obviously cant? :D Shocker one reading article, headline brings rage. Amazing Reddit works. Cite source. Also, OP lied symptoms studied. Oh sure, random enough protect hundred million dollars Bitcoin, certainly random enough produce exact set data multiple times. take cursory glance detect fuckery afoot. obviously know nothing comment history.  
I tired people lazy even read article reacting to. much people thats main problem world. covid. understand correctly comments, aware comparison basically useless (and arguably highly misleading) - think repeated nonetheless “a warning.” 

Are familiar term “fearmongering”? It’s like wearing bulletproof vest hole cut middle. Sure, it’ll give protection, someone coughs face you’re gonna get it. saw least 5,000 people there. That’s data me. I’ve satisfied people Sweden aren’t wearing masks, it’s good enough purposes I’m trying publish observations. 

Suggesting can’t draw conclusions mask usage Sweden seeing masks 4 days nonstop touring, including crowded places, seems little unscientific me.  Yah it’s like yah let’s fill schools people country. Let mix coronavirus infects enough two three weeks we’ll cancel everything send everyone back across country infect people weren’t infected before. Welp. Here's people thinking would eventually return maskless old normal... long back school teaching children? believe completed vaccines totally fine too? Never problems huh? fact happens trials shows arent perfect tricky complications even ones approved. like common sense, point im trying make, idiot. redundant articles keep getting posted, people seriously oblivious? Think hardly office job, workers required sit butt 8 hours per day. breeding ground virus necessarily, likely lots high risk workers due lack physical activity. common environments workers around country. That's great general health, unfortunately *actual* blood pressure makes vulnerable - abundance ACE2 receptors makes vulnerable - change long long time even lowered blood pressure.

You still vulnerable before. whole state Florida, average test positivity rate past week 13.7%. Yup know okay let public large know deaths children teachers? long let continue many justified die kids sent school person learning? clicks selling fear better good reason keep stuff like public explain right everyone else wrong. realistically know large portion people higher risk category. Instead acting like big deal. subtext clear: whole thing overblown. Well, told them, know someone died, someone whose parents nearly died ventilators, someone age (60s) tested positive.

Doesn’t care get sick. Pretty much course sociopaths outbreak. least it’s easy spot them. Wow, completely vicious backlash peaceful unarmed BLM protests I've seen, must bloodbath! Huh? read medical studies? There’s whole bunch reasons covid turns obesity death sentence, high blood pressure. reside area woman. currently code red, yet public officials literally nothing. In-person schooling continues. mask mandate. Nothing. Florida Ohio? long incubation period international flights time realized here, spreading awhile. Thanks. That’s reassuring. ""Among people spanned nine Minnesota counties, including ""educators, long-term care workers, health care workers,"" said.""

Seriously, screw guests went wedding took COVID-19 work pass along. reddit psychologists. Men want bigger balls /s Teacher unions state state. Coincidentally (or not) states strong unions distance learning right states weak unions in-person classes. Sad indeed. mourn sacrifice martyrs celebrate deaths enemies. Isn’t wild leaders actively killing us and...nobody seems care? Welcome safety procedures. work like this. You’re free volunteer study new information. Heads roll continue another case without really thorough investigation. think regulatory officers CEO willing risk that?  tests work welcome Ridiculous. inflation? live CA teacher end salary scale making 100k year. cost living cheap CA, certainly bad deal. Hey like Fauci says ""I never muzzled... comes evidence facts."" airborne, technically? dies fresh air. late pal... Many states person school don’t unions don’t allow teacher strikes. cannot imagine may better death toll 6 months pandemic rather hit started immediately without Federal support knowledge treat individuals virus.

They lost far 12,000 people virus.

And yes; easily hidden. someone dies, attribute COVID. city Bergen Norway went 10 day lock expodential growth past 3 weeks student population spilled general. higher daily infections March. Worth noting also wearing masks Tuesday That's apparently people avoiding testing too! Damn, whack physician nuts. physician says virus unpredictable affect people differently. Tells risk getting it. Fauci said he's communicating Coronavirus info pretty accurately... filled one out. Whether get gig not, mods really focus source stories posted. 

There lot subpar sources information. Yes. . .  Either follow proto, live long enough die chomo.

Feather Peace, Conald. guess need fucking daddy hold hand thing. say anyone two goddamn fucking brain cells can't figure fuck fucking own. Wear mask, wash hands, avoid crowds. Goddamn fuck man. happening, yeah. I'm sure organization heads it? big name confirmed indeed holding it, matter what. Unlike media, vested interest making despise people. Nope. Sorry. cat's staying right here. *Somebody* eat face die.

Also, awesome. &lt;3 That’s works. get rare serious condition associated vaccines before, you’re first mission think it’s unrelated. Safety regulations work way. Ask would volunteer study way gather information. 

In hometown (pop 500 000) one put ventilator 10 days whole country (pop 10 million) less 15 persons ventilator now. willingly take vaccine situation people wouldn’t accept anything perfect trial. unknown risk transverse myelitis could higher 1/5000 totally unacceptable. Cringe Thanks findin that, worth. - maybe i'll get fake reddit points back... ffs -50 Putin: **Challenge accepted.**

I wonder whether Trump thank Putin that. Shudders... JHU shows 13 percent uprise florida state. Using kind stitch? Many have. districts forced start remote many teachers resigned forced go face face. able hide it. fact.

Um think would? modern world technology information videos leaked constantly.

Information actually rarely leaked China. C'mon bro, let's this.

I know deaths per million is; Florida less 100 behind Michigan continues see deaths Michigan; months.

Exactly debunked Florida fudging numbers? Florida epicenter new Corona virus cases along Texas California three months.

And know what, wrong! Florida 6 TIMES number cases Michigan had, think numbers accurate? 

Cuomo boy, locked New York state save lives. Would like show metropolitan area Florida densely populated New York City?

No? can't? Oh, mean, else country would able show sort population density affected onset pandemic 0 Federal support?

Didn't think so.

You're obviously supporter Trump, lied seriousness virus failed nation protecting it, enlisted simple minded tools spread disinformation pathetic attempts retaining go, bro. Go ahead listen fearless leader tell truth virus. dangerous deadly is, spread..through air...and worse flu. Exactly thought too. I'm Canada even convos I've bunch people, many us weary first get vaccine \[although understanding someone go first\] reason. rational people end get long declared safe. 

So even rational people country done fantastic job containing already worried it. definitely long haul despise Trump.. trust Fauci’s word. lot places honest it. Found coworker old job quarantined Ill gf found asked seen week. states districts handling education wonderfully unions strongly advocated. states don’t teacher unions nearly strong enough organize statewide strike. state started mostly remote, except private schools, likely stay remote remainder year vaccine readily available. 

This took lot organizing district state union didn’t come strike. Gotta buy time backfire. He's spicy little Italian boy. makea goot prediction DONTA DIE!!!  favorite ice cream place can't keep amount selling. They've hire staff churn ice cream 24/7 running out. think China imprisoned (and still imprisons) journalists, scientists doctors reported COVID back 2019? amount people living willful ignorance comments fucking depressing. Thinking politics discussed coronavirus sub day Trump admitted downplaying entire thing, potentially causing hundreds thousands deaths everything wrong online moderation. agree pause. continue get volunteers, make clearly one subject issue. completely volunteer go along trial not, plenty people would try help out, money, reduction criminal sentence. quantifiable risk, mean great.

Remember context. Everyday thousands Americans dying Covid-19, even globally. good safe, continued what's stake. agree stopping one, pattern appears figure issue, sure. username checks out. right. He's voice reason many months, full grace face utter stupidity. He's threatened, family also...And remember Trump said jealous - people liked Fauci him? Hah. 

Fauci echoed everything saw Reddit. followed progression virus Italy here...you knew come. Thank god Reddit. far saved lives everyone family. always turn info. Hopefully one family catches COVID - saving money vacation isn’t worth chance. doctors? mean “doctor” said hydroxychloroquine effective COVID solution proved wasn’t? “doctor” believes sex demons alien sperm?


Get fuck here, bot. agree. public figure makes one significant false misleading statement important matter, never listen let retain decision-making power.

Hey, wait minute... 100K people trial though.

Maybe end something young healthy use? would still beneficial enhanced rapid testing rolled out. pretend can't anything else help us Florida fudging numbers, means done even better regards death toll. virus cases may drastically higher, death would easily hidden. Michigan fudging numbers, imply, death rate remains even drastically higher Florida's 6.1% vs. 1.9% Anyone ever figure SARS-CoV-2 spread every corner world matter month two? suppose could started November spread people started figuring Jan/Feb. “When school children start paying union dues, that’s I’ll start representing interests school children.”--former American Federation Teachers president Al Shanker I’m confused. Students supposed quarantined allowed go indoor spaces others required there, long shift position within room every 14 minutes? quarantine means. don’t really disagree countries listed laugh mention North Korea. one knows happening *general*, much less coronavirus lol Seems pretty rich them, actually. HAIL ANTS! Please restore see it. adults read bad words. Downvotes exist reason. are.

It's getting lot scroll past lately, yeah. Might well make different sub individual obits. novel coronavirus. Everybody get vaccine herd immunity. Best young people get infected first. Also, treatments better 6 months ago.  Lol bad boy! Damn! wish could cool buddy! Yeah know right. stupid think are. School children wear Pe kits day changing rooms bad. busses etc fair game. ok wearing mask changing classroom enough protect everyone.

Thanks! love near Mentor go 1-2 times month. majority citizens walking around masks. hospital work screening entrance uses (probably) massively expensive temperature checker looks like metal detector use airports. Completely pointless know tiny terrorist shoot gun huh? Look Melbourne extent shutdown relative case numbers. 

If attacking shutdown basis rational government would shut extent, here's counter-example. takes go elimination rather temporary containment.

But yeah, surprised start mass testing outbreak already decline, hence test numbers lower actual cases - something true across world. That's 80%. like 60% Massachusetts think. bad. Glass half empty half-full? say worry all? Pretty sure didn’t. 

It objectively misleading create impression covid likely kill healthy young people, article does. trust someone covid they're currently dumb enough travel almost worked volkswagen lot people: TSA, passengers; etc. suffer. That’s objective apolitical thing say. No. Masks work! Bruh I’ve worse mask since shit started I’ve worked right it, colds. guess head sand eh? Right. think many people using masks social distancing compared last year. Could major dampening effect spread flu. COVID-19 can't pass threshold classroom pub obviously. kind like vampires needing permission. wanted 🤷 whole pandemic started 1 person. wonder many cases long run saved 15 people. Exponential growth scary thing highly contagious disease like this, could mean millions infections saved. 

Now call useless many people think US oversees like everything lol that’s another thing. many healthy young people died? clearly understand anything infectious disease spreads. Leaving states local municipalities, thereby mandates precautions others without them, like peeing section swimming pool. Eventually homogenizes. need get scholarship stipend taken away cancelled season. Right. They're adults, get paid collective bargaining get protection deserve like pro sports do. even complaining about. spend extra 10 seconds get work temperature check isn’t big Deal. It’s 100% effective, garbage coworkers come work fever stopped now, that’s worth minuscule amount inconvenience. People acting like they’re subjected hour long cavity search something. Stop snowflake get it. Great. it’s going even harder fly America. Thanks Trump, stellar job literally everything you’ve done. stellar, mean terrible. absolutely can’t envision way handle pandemic presidency general worse have. worse you’d run office pitchforks. Every day goes I’m still surprised haven’t yet, we’re fucking sick point it’s kind hard. Social security lmao. country living in? america. teachers retire *can't*. There's many teachers work additional part time jobs teacher's salary enough survive many states. I’m glad things working now. shut non essentials lot longer (ma) month we’ve gotten things control like 1% positivity rate low cases sucked saved lives. Sounds like ignorant.

Go read it. 
China bribed many politicians officials throughout Canada, Europe, US, Australia. Every spy agency working countries said last year. say psycho? I’m saying people aren’t obese issues don’t need worry nearly much. Christ. people sensitive  believe this. really bad wheezing (in TX) would go away last December 3-4 weeks, pretty much entire December crazy us, looking around, kinds things (sleeping separate places, hiring maid deep cleaning, breathing treatment, coughing med, chest X-Ray), wondering (we medical background), flu ever lasts long.

We international travels since July last year, sort community spread. Completely agreed. There's value lockdowns, get wrong, ""why virus come back, locked down!?"" nonsensical complaint.

Either stay locked vaccine comes, eventually get spikes. see world, Canada Hawaii Jakarta. ""There lot low hanging fruit complain regarding White House mismanagement Covid, another."" 


FTFY also don’t understand way discussion try rude/aggressive. I’m legit trying debate think saying incorrect. agree! underlying conditions? Pretty ridiculous headline. lmao “screening” almost useless anyways...so seems fine. fine, least brand. I’m hoping least parents able get soon it’s safe, don’t mind waiting get vaccinated later date There's arguably fourth category: died due extreme vulnerability end-of-life, happens Covid could easily circulating pathogen - food poisoning, UTI, flu, etc. again, number significant. I'm faster, safe. People subreddit want remain scared getting downvoted. idea reopen let COVID-19 run course falls apart even mildest scrutiny.

People companies going pretend COVID-19 thing. People still going stay home. Businesses still going suffer. Nothing change significantly economy stable baseline operations contains risk predictably.

Since we've 1-2 % population contract virus far, things would need get 35-75 times worse got herd immunity. 

There mechanism open wage slavery, government knows can't let people starve go homeless massive numbers. 

There available levers supporting public health (maximizing masks/testing/contact tracing/gathering limits) supporting citizens financially (unemployment basic assistance payments). Ignoring things makes life harder people trying survive pandemic, puts pressure try keep working, makes pandemic worse therefore makes intervention required severe.

Much like tax cuts lead larger national therefore increased future taxes, trying keep country open possible pandemic forcing us less open longer pandemic.

It's hard think through, people aggressively trained think.  evidence that, wearing mask guarantee get sick, result less severe illness. Wearing mask means get less viral load, mean reduced symptoms.

Masks never meant prevent illness. reduces risk. understand frustration, useless. Keep understanding limitations intervention. I’m masks doesn’t really seem practical sports.. They're unbelievably shit soft power. can't wait old guards retire new blood come show done today's era. read it. article said 5% hospitalized COVID-19 ages 18 34, young patients, death rate 2.7%. percentage young people virus hospitalized? Perhaps clue in... serious censorship going sub. removed post Dr Zhong receiving award ceremony, citing confront mod it, TF cares dude got award. Great, good - There's still lot danger bunch young people getting virus, feeling sick, spreading others 

- one knows long term effects. Yeah maybe die now, it'll fuck lungs they'll die 10 years sooner otherwise.

- we're also talking way cause outbreaks could contained one school districts/university spreading another. 

- what? Sports? get they're lot fun, love watching foot all, can't wait NFL start. there's people's health safety stake. actual data smokers dying much higher levels? seen anywhere. I've actually seen opposite. Men dying higher rate related numerous factors smoking. even smoke besides occasional cigar scream bias, curious. underestimate America think it’s interesting see differences data provide. numbers, testing “bins”. ND splits faculty, grad students, undergrad students, whereas BU puts groups one bucket. like ND’s approach more. Gives us little idea cases coming “Bannister diagnosed virus Friday died Monday.”


That’s pretty damn scary. time act surprised now?     
:O What? didn’t remove goes show intelligence prerequisite attending college. beautiful cases Lmao ""China soft manipulation US journalism"". wizards? Sometimes Americans make laugh there's way humans stupid yet are. ready could mean everything manufactured distributed, comes approval. 

No, specifically mentions data. ""I still think track set data would submit end year"" aside, October would fall “before end year” timeline.

But say October. That's pure unadulterated lie. misinformation. someone could predicted edit comment remove statement serving military decade? ask ever shot head... US pays it. ;) fine all, big companies need massive tax breaks bailouts, soooo..../s Ah well, wishful thinking. Thank much info. Westerners: brainwashed!

Also westerners: ima drink bleach POTUS says so!

Also westerners: masks work! Nope, we're stupid stop traveling. \^THIS Nice. don’t understand clarifying statement next post doesn’t suffice? completely understand thought process, make less stupid frustrating. us following precautions better less bored, less frustrated, less tired this. get dealing emotions involve saying 'screw it, might well risk death permanent organ damage others!' ways cope plenty fair people upset frustrated others chose cope contributing spread thing upset about. None us would stuck extreme circumstance long people dealt get-go; precisely attitudes perpetuate frustrating situation.

I've dealt long-term healing chronic injury before. Trust say even frustrating 'nothing' world actually going around you. promised life constant joy ride people need wrap heads around reality instead putting others risk can't figure another way cope feelings us having, many us dealt before. people like feeling quarantine boredom isolation, certainly going enjoy doom staring death coping chronic illness rest lives. ""Debate me"", announces guy insists famous widely studied police dogs actually cats, burden scientific evidence prove otherwise I'm deemed reasonable party here. foolish. trying attract people disease-ridden state stimulate economy create jobs, going work. Respectable people want exposed kind nasty shenanigans goes Sturgis. I'm talking sneezing contests, fat topless biker chicks. Although kind gross too. broke af ate fine. Oatmeal, rice, beans, potatoes. Yah done cant even watch video see dismissive masks. thing even point protect ourselves. guess really brainwashed agenda.

He fucking says interview ""there's reason walking around masks"" whole world fucking already point, even countries almost cases. screw him.

Any doctor says dont need mask airborne virus, pandemic, idea virus capable hack liar. guess support that.

While saying need mask, people buy said. Luckily ignored bought masks im really glad think objectively use common sense.

And know days later, NIH, surgeon General backed statements, masks really needed never objected it, thus cementing position further.

Now says ""universal wearing masks essential"" go one position another? fucking lied deliberately.  knew wear masks 1913. either he's worst doctor world found new information wow masks work! lied purpose. dont think he's stupid know masks essential back then, lied. go educate sister new information. New covid-19 deaths, yesterday:

*Reported* yesterday. deaths reported yesterday days / weeks ago. example Florida reported 200 deaths, 126 July August. [Here's good dropping dramatically like across country, lag reporting also happening. 2 weeks potentially we'll see way lower July peak. Coronavirus around since least 1965. 

Most people exposed different forms coronavirus.

H1N1 novel flu strain 2009. luxury must free burden critical thinking  Makes sense. quarantine, another student gets infected, repeat process? There's lot wrong this. Firstly, plenty connecting flights Philippines US. one would rationally wait five six months avoid connecting flight. 

Secondly, Philippine Airlines resumed service Manila SFO/LAX early July IIRC. caused stop Philippine government, economics (also IIRC).

Thirdly, US consulates chartered repatriation flights cases US citizens legitimately stranded ( ). Small additional thing: limit max 50 people gathered anything recreational makes everyday office/production/etc work- school-life seem normal, entertainment sports businesses (among others) things much operating usual.

This also goes hobbies - many currently restricted. one miss playing orchestra can't, access venue enough space proper ventilation - outdoors place matter - many members elderly willing take risks all. would also go current recommendations public transportation us able get without it. Sure, there's tangible punishment anyone travel non-essential reasons, that's needed - would simply wrong. So, wait. win lottery I'm glad live fascist dictatorship 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 Occam's razor: America's issues likely caused massive hidden contrail conspiracy lower collective IQ...

/s Well worth reading. 

I guess need scale back expectations vaccine do, least near term. 

People (70%) still need wear masks / social distance even 70% us vaccinated? Maybe Germans achieve numbers. US? prayer. 

And point, they’re testing people 65+ minorities. means shouldn’t get vaccine testing happened. Yet, need 😣 Bergen western Norway, northern Norway.  opposite??? Yep - addressed that. average age newly infected gone down, across Europe. Partly due much testing demographic compared early pandemic.

Your original point leading younger healthier people filling ICUs. clear misinterpretation 3 sources provided. Norway really good. Every country western Central Europe really bad numbers compared Norway. first announced it, made wonder- exactly ""halt"" trial people already injected medication..? Goodness gracious great balls fire, ya ruined Okay? still shows beyond flu. every report chart contain data. North Idaho, bad anti-mask idiots too. putting kids e-school, went yesterday pickup supplies, several parents kids also without masks. places! Nobody says word. protests outside county building also announced (finally) formal mask mandate. county sheriff almost immediately said, publicly, enforce it. helped. /s Sort of. mass protest sake protesting masks. LGBTQ there, Reichsburger (people denial Germany country) there, alt-right types, anti-maskers.

In total, 30,000 crazies went Berlin spread virus among themselves, I'm bothered.

The craziest among try storm parliament. get far, really intend to. stunt social media. It’s Roanoke. I’m south people aren’t wearing masks stores aren’t enforcing them. It’s shit show tempted visit Beijing vaccination. ever run business?

Do expect every mom pop coffee shop team attorneys ready tackle law suits come way? think they'd hire professional management team operate business?

I love quoted like true intellectual, put countered me, meaning intended debate, could muster logical replies offered rebuttals *your* absurdities lolll. Cant believe contradicted reply HAHAHA. looked civil discussion someone, came looking debate. It’s originally replied random comment post barely traction. 

Get man, like hearing different opposing opinion people, petty insults idiot behind screen. think still case. pandemic likely pandemic long noticed unlike Spanish Flu, good chunk people even notice they're sick. I'm inclined think we're lot closer herd immunity think. Especially anti body tests tell us infected within last couple months necessarily percent population already overall. hospitalised cases, thats important detail. differenza dell’inizio della pandemia, nelle ultime settimane l’età media dei neo contagiati è scesa enormemente. Solo il 29% dei nuovi casi nelle ultime due settimane ha un’età superiore 50 anni: il 14% sono ragazzi minorenni, il 56,8% persone dai 19 ai 50 anni.
L’età mediana ora è 35 anni, contro 60 dei primi due mesi peso delle vacanze all’estero
Nelle ultime due settimane per le quali abbiamo dati (27 luglio-9 agosto 2020), si sono registrati 820 casi cittadini italiani di ritorno da un viaggio all’estero, particolare da paesi ad alta crescita di infezioni. Nel complesso sul totale dei nuovi casi settimanali, la maggior parte dei casi (615) ha contratto la malattia un’altra nazione (30,9%), 467 casi si sono contagiati ambito familiare, 152 casi (7,6%) residenze sanitarie assistenziali comunità per disabili. Occorre tenere conto – precisa ISS – che il dato è disponibile solo per una piccola parte dei casi segnalati. anyone die auto accident driving motorcycle without helmet certainly increases chances. Somewhat interesting one earlier ""rebel restaurants"" (a creperie), part coalition (yet?).

The creperie bad luck/timing. Opened successful pop-up parking lot moved massively remodeled storefront virus. athletes also wear ankle weights take later improve performance. biggest mistake people seem keep making Trump literally unintelligent, he's not. he's genius he's purpose. know districts give separate contracts union workers. Non union teachers follow contract union negotiated study needed hospitalised, turned 5% cases require hospitalisation 2% group died miniscule risk US care citizens, think they're gonna care someone else's? It’s something us never really thought about. never heard r rate March. You’re right bad envisioning it, since number actually led believe I’d definitely give get wife because.

Ready 100°F days eeennnndd quality data gathering decidedly taken turn worse hardest-hit areas u wont see 10k day us till 2022 youd lucky get 20k community, know restaurants covid cases know ones roaches rats. Yep, unless health problems, delaying well-pet visit good idea. Vet clinics everywhere overwhelmed right it’s beyond ridiculous. Eating 200 skittles kill anyway it? Get cloth mask, get better cloth mask Lol sarcastic? We're stopping halfway through, barely started, half country even seem believe germ theory. wait! Look studies iceland showing bad! one, university dominican republic! legit promise! /s HHS CDC going real conundrum hand vaccine done. don’t trust anything say I’m progressive come, I’m sure I’m one disenfranchised recent controversies. think what's crazy anytime there's headline Dr. Fauci recommends something talks something else pandemic, I'm never surprised. 

This man trying damn hard spread many us consider common fucking sense point, yet people complicated understand. know keeps good poker face time, must screaming inside. Welp confident beliefs, feel need insult mine?

I'm redneck. I'm even American.

I'm asking believe ME, I'm saying blindly believe someone authoritative figure, ""expert"". Yeah, Fauci successful career medical field, think word put everyone else's.

What wrong belief? Please explain wrong question someone tell something. account order view article? We're never getting this, we. Even get vaccine, enough people take one's going trade COVID-filled cesspit years. Uno reverse card. Surely would case believing Sao Paulo governor. Wedding Four Funerals. need fired rendered useless.

Besides that, understand anyone continue hold onto blind faith ability institutions bureaucracy apprehend dictatorial whims person like Trump, president. administration perfect demonstration rule law contract broken without repercussions? Let tell answer: absolutely is. There's narrative Fauci brave, selfless hero speaking truth power, also muzzled White House. reality met moment spends lot time giving milquetoast interviews, liberals glorify alpha male medical oracle, like white-coat Robert Mueller. Fauci helping us. one is.

Maybe happened administration utterly corrupt callous towards lives people 'they supposed protect, would hand controlling fucking awful virus, old man past prime match evil fucks answers to. Sorry loss nothing personal Dr. Fauci hands tied behind back. literally choice say use masks easier trying get people understand situation in, plus wouldnt cause panic. unfortunate ultimately right move. Healthcare providers 100% top priority protect continue saving lifes. point Dr. Fauci said wear masks, national security issue takes precedence anything else, especially people stay home. again, sorry loss I'm trying mean. 

I remember months ago, took walk counting number masks saw floor. think hit 6 7 stopped actively looking pissing off. 6 masks doctors/nurses use like 2 months literally work face face people covid positive 12+ hours day, 5+ days week. need anything? cup coffee, masks, whatever else? don’t lot DM let know. wife nurse know it’s really hard (physically emotionally) right now. way. can't afford it. want see half everyone love ending street?

That’s okay, I’m dog it’s mostly hear anyway. country earth pulls shit America. Plenty capitalist countries still universal healthcare, that's tax dollars supposed for. vaccine ends Covid-19

That's likely, we're looking flu shot type situation. Research subject flaws. People continually gravitate toward research validates opinions. 

Great example: nutrition research, rise diet dogmatism - keto, vegetarian, intermittent fasting, whatever, research backs different diets. that's research subject error, probably multiple explanations based methodology.  Well, ominous. I'm giving opinion either direction wanted focus idiom used.. ""Sidelined"" 

As athlete sidelined means team ability use skill(knowledge case) chooses so... diagnosis claimed incorrect sure. fact considered means patient symptoms fit original diagnosis. big headline I'm guessing mask thing. major fuck up. Knowing interest medical industrial complex American people made recommendations based that... well, pretty fucked.

NOT undermining need PPE healthcare workers, factors involved lack much broader ""Americans"" (definitely China...) hoarding masks back then, shamed for. I’m San Jose well also late January doctor diagnosed “pneumonia” Covid like symptoms well. “There’s confirmed cases don’t travel I’m going able get tested”.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm.

Pneumonia take fully recover Cool, I’m glad like end 2020, 100 million doses could manufactured, said. initial batch doses would available Americans free, companies said, though would account entire population country, hovers around 328 million. 

You made point saying 100 million doses *could be*manufactured end year. correct according article, still doesn’t cover roughly 228 million remaining Americans. Therefore, it’s unreasonable assume *average* person still likely get vaccine next year.

The original point comment point receiving vaccine Pfizer realistic expectation people given year. I’m sure point you’re trying make, we’re arguing thing slightly different angles.  gotta wash hands, wash equipment use it. 

I supposed start back gym tomorrow, found tonight someone location tested positive virus. Nope. Closed. appreciate honesty management.  could see tears makeup? Sure, buy letters places. also weird people compare huge country small island countries. Like there, wont work here.

In conclusion states Sweden right see rising case numbers change anything strategy Denmark Norway do/did see rise opening quite quickly, alloweing rather big events on. Somehow Times made sound like Sweden claimed victory, never did. official motto still ""Keep distance, keep vigilant"", lifted restrictions Sweden. Man Swedish media authorities executed propaganda perfectly.  I’m Bahrain programme Sinopharm still ongoing, got 3000 half way through. Meanwhile, insisting legal definition instead biological one context pandemic valid intellectually sound either.

I never even argued legal definition. halfwit thought legal definition apply complained. Sorry pointing negatives lockdown fantasy. america comes healthcare get screwed. pay crazy high premiums every month health insurance need use pay certain amount total year first ( deductible) pocket. hit deductible get fight insurance company continually get get bills covered. system amount influence insurance companies healthcare system health costs astronomical. Pretty much pay extortion fees insurance companies year pray get sick. Given vax history initial lethal fail questionable outcomes (polio vax ban/incomplete data sets); ""good news""? 

learn reason vax mandatory; attend public hearing learn more.  Well lot 737 Max used.... neighbor brought petition open everything up. Meanwhile, cases area going up. Americans counted right thing, they've tried everything else.

- Winston Churchill. need 280k day beat daily record per capita.  ""We killed people could done"" - Sweden Good news Americans then, there’s lot brain left confuse. mean arguing legal definition child vs adult valid complaint. Yes. black people (and white people) resist arrest still getting killed police amount rioting going change that. Well slap ass call surprised! fuck saw coming. Oh yeah. Everyone least single brain cell Florida response. adjusted nothing. sons school announced virtual month two ago, HUGE back lash. Eventually decided let parents choose it. shit? think us could told advance. know DeSantis likely diverge leanings poster replying to, pretty clear purposefully misled masks. 
No one iota sense bought lies, certainly calculated lies. 
I seem recall even admitted task force one point. 

It didn’t way though. 
I could come 101 ways masks could stockpiled hospitals preserving message masks effective barrier disease. 
I lost quite bit respect involved (not including trump, never anyway) debacle. 

This say nothing / CDC completely bungled message... callous thing say. ""Inaccurate""? brand new, never observed. Youre seriously crafting higher necessary pedestal, protect silly pooh bear. literally blew whistle, private message? still whistle blow.

Youre riot mate. group people glad getting f*cked lockdown. Parasites. Pretty close, parent’s basement #11 world deaths per million count San Marino Andorra (both populations less 100,000). Imagine going pandemic without Fauci Weird sounds like longterm effects caused MSM... muzzled scientific community, believe that. think deaths 60% peak months increasing definition getting control, sure stand corrected.  


Then much could really trust Russian numbers. July reported less 6000 deaths, excess deaths 30000. July alone. (worldometer 4600 July 670+ health care workers memory list. ""We've number close contacts we've urged get tested who, fact, positive later developed symptoms,"" McDonald said. ""We know catching cases very, early isolation quarantine students, effectively carried on-campus off-campus... feel is, fact, reducing transmission.""

 That's good news, remote learning would better. fact you’re downvoted fact perfect reflection whole Covid ordeal. Facts dammed! Mass fear panic!

For saying ‘she still died yada yada yada’. Yes, did, course tragic. However 190k people country died disease reason story told she’s teacher click-bait fear driving media using fact make afraid send kids school. think countries Europe like Portugal hopening schools next week fucking terrifying. see happening US safeguard own? think would happen announced vaccine 5 years away ? think people would stay socially distanced 5 years?

Or woukd likely take fuck approach. way 5 years away people woukd accept curtailment quality life long. Especially low risk groups. Good idea! Outside colleges really area truly hit twice? northeast slow uptick nothing like back March April. sun belt still trending down, etc. ‘science’ name something? hell ‘science disagrees’ lmao. Damn... damn. marginalized groups always affected disproportionately due lack generational wealth stability?! That, fact, system angry makes sick. Get race bating ignorant bull shit. way! Fauci far best all. agree lionizing people acknowledging mistakes, especially mistakes dire outcomes mask compliance. Depends upon soon get Trump OOO. Different demographics could different levels denial different reasons engaging it.
Without collecting data race, gender, age, sexual orientation, education, income, political affiliation, would way knowing whether demographic likely engaged denial. information important, different demographics different reasons it, necessary understand order create public health information listen to.
Anecdotally, people know personally, cis-het white men appear worst culprits comes denial ignoring guidelines.

I started wearing masks sent home office told work remotely (when shopping grocery store). certainly wait government tell so. Ultimately people need understand health mostly hands.

Personally, would LOVE teacher, several students tell much enjoyed learning (taught A+ courses back day, beadwork classes), think I'd probably good - can't afford take kind cut pay. started considering becoming teacher 15 years ago, checked required education starting salaries would take 10k cut pay take student loan debt, well. I'm making quite bit then, economically huge no-go. 

Add COVID-19 aspect, can't see good reason anyone would choose become teacher anytime near future... provides reason it. Europe's desth rate much lower

Europe universal fucking healthcare don't. think able see doctor probably greater predictor survival fat, even BMIs 40 matter. Fat shaming jack shit help pandemic would like see case numbers rise reflect ACTUAL state covid campus sooner fake month long lockdown fewer Americans ultimately die. herd immunity success there? 1. Information reliable sources claim inside information it’s transverse myelitis. least know it’s SAE bad enough cause immediate termination enrollment. 

2. don’t know long term effects things, it’s bad approach downplay risk vaccine overstate risk disease you’re longing cure. 

3. Phase 3 studies almost chance detect rare serious side effect even presume 50 000 enrolled chance 1 million SAE happen study period. Therefore, serious SAE that’s linked vaccines must investigated manner expect common. mean, it’s 1/5000 study 5000 individuals would still detect 60% chance. 

4. Probably language barrier thing, thought invasive ventilation called using ventilator, Swedish say respirator. 

5. answer (3) pretty much explains always must investigate potential side effect vaccine. SAE put investigators awkward position. going say next person enroll idea related vaccine? practically would lie risks make lay man participate. asked colleagues today (MDs) many would volunteer right say it’s safe. one would. Even find underlying condition patient know everyone checked beforehand therefore it’s dead vaccine. situation pune weird thing take there's inverse relationship risk young vs. old. seem feel worse 60 less concerned 40. Nah, put sign banning guns prohibit teachers guns, everyone knows teachers probably going shoot students given chance. Liberal logic Kinda irrelevant specifically studying certain age group.or going claim 200k young people died covid? one old man going change much compared another old man. support Trump, nothing going change Biden wins.

Things change people start taking covid seriously. Start listening mask lock requirement recommendations. happen. People country stupid. listen. nobody enforcing mandates. words, water wet. many dollars get study? vaccine won’t bring back seems like common sense. Ya know what, though?

- **No proof SARS-CoV-2 genetically engineered**

In sum, __the Nature Medicine article authors offer *no evidence* SARS-CoV-2 virus could genetically engineered. *That's say was, course.* can’t know one way basis currently available information.__

**Dr Antoniou wrote short letter Nature Medicine point omissions authors’ case.** Nature Medicine method submitting simple letter editor, Dr Antoniou submit Matters Arising commentary, journal defines presenting ""challenges clarifications"" original published work.

Dr Antoniou's comments titled, ""SARS-CoV-2 could created laboratory manipulation"". __However, Nature Medicine *refused publish* grounds “we feel advance clarify understanding” original article. *The journal offered scientific argument rebut points.*__

In view, points offer clarification original article, what’s more, strong public interest case making public. That’s reproduce Dr Antoniou’s letter article, permission.

- **Not genetic engineering – human intervention**

There is, incidentally, another possible way SARS-CoV-2 could developed laboratory, case without using genetic engineering. [pointed Nikolai Petrovsky, researcher College Medicine Public Health Flinders University South Australia. Petrovsky says coronaviruses cultured lab dishes cells human ACE2 receptor. time, virus gain adaptations let efficiently bind receptors. Along way, virus would pick random genetic mutations pop anything noticeable.

“The result experiments virus highly virulent humans sufficiently different longer resembles original bat virus,” Petrovsky said. “Because mutations acquired randomly selection, signature human gene jockey, clearly virus still created human intervention.”

Dr Antoniou agrees method possible – points **waiting nature produce desired mutations lot slower using genetic engineering generate large number random mutations select desired outcome directed iterative evolutionary procedure.** 

**Because genetic engineering greatly speeds process, far efficient way generate novel pathogenic viruses lab.**

- **Vested Interests?**

*__So experts – non-experts matter – seem determined put stop speculation whether SARS-CoV-2 could genetically engineered?__*

*__One explanation might fear backlash research victims pandemic. Virologists, example, may want much freedom possible study manipulate viruses labs, won’t want research restricted public concern. Others using genetic engineering work may also fear damage general reputation technology encourage tighter regulation.__*

*__And concerns SARS-CoV-2 may developed lab gain traction, consequences heavily commercialised area biotechnology might reputational also financial.__*

*__In context worth noting one authors Nature Medicine piece Robert F. Garry, lists “competing interest” “co-founder Zalgen Labs, biotechnology company develops countermeasures emerging viruses”. Heavier restrictions genetic engineering laboratory virus research might considered counter interests Zalgen Labs.__*

Andersen et al. Nature Medicine paper mentioned actually highly flawed, yet, gets cited over. Here’s why:

*__Response Pt. 1:__*

Since COVID-19 pandemic took off, speculation rife origins. __*The truth nobody knows certain virus first took hold.* despite uncertainty, suggestions virus may genetically engineered, otherwise lab-generated, rejected “conspiracy theories” incompatible evidence.__

__Yet, main evidence cited ending speculation role genetic engineering proving virus could product natural evolution turns *surprisingly weak*.__ Let’s take look it.

The authors recently published journal Nature Medicine argue SARS-CoV-2 virus driving pandemic arose natural mutation selection animal (notably bats pangolins) human hosts, laboratory manipulation accidental release. say identified two key characteristics virus prove this: absence previously used virus backbone way virus binds human cells.

*__Not ""ideal"" design infectivity?__*

As would expect virus cause global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 good infecting human cells. binding high affinity (that is, binds strongly) cell surface membrane protein known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), enables enter human cells. But, basing argument computer modelling system, authors Nature Medicine paper argue interaction virus ACE2 receptor “not ideal”. 

They say receptor-binding domain (RBD) amino acid sequence SARS-CoV-2 spike protein – part spike protein allows virus bind ACE2 protein human cell surfaces – different shown SARS-CoV family viruses optimal receptor binding. 

They appear argue, based others’ computer modelling data, identified “ideal” CoV spike protein RBD amino acid sequence ACE2 receptor binding. seem imply genetically engineer SARS-CoV optimal human ACE2 binding infectivity, would use RBD amino acid sequence predicted computer modelling. point SARS-CoV-2 exactly computer program-predicted RBD amino acid sequence. Thus conclude could genetically engineered, stating: “This strong evidence SARS-CoV-2 product purposeful manipulation.”

To put simply, authors saying SARS-CoV-2 deliberately engineered were, would designed differently. 

However, London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou commented line reasoning fails take account number laboratory-based systems select high affinity RBD variants able take account complex environment living organism. complex environment may impact efficiency SARS-CoV spike protein find ACE2 receptor bind it. RBD selected via realistic real-world experimental systems would “ideal”, even so, human ACE2 binding RBD computer model could predict. crucially, would likely different amino acid sequence. fact SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t RBD amino acid sequence one computer program predicted way rules possibility genetically engineered.

*__Limits computer modelling__*

Dr Antoniou said authors’ reasoning conclusive based largely computer modelling, which, says, “not definitive predictive. cannot tell us whether given virus would optimized infectivity real world scenario, human body. That's environment human body influence virus interacts receptor. can’t model accurately computer modelling simply many variables factor equation.” 

Dr Antoniou added, “People put much faith computer programs, beginning. prove whether computer program’s prediction correct direct experimentation living organism. done case hypothesis, remains unproven.”

It even possible SARS-CoV-2 optimized using living organism model, resulting virus better infecting humans computer model could predict.

*__More one way engineer virus__*

A well-known alternative process could used cumbersome name “[directed iterative evolutionary selection case, would involve using genetic engineering generate large number randomly mutated versions SARS-CoV spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), would selected strong binding ACE2 receptor consequently high infectivity human cells. 

This selection done either purified proteins or, better still, mixture whole coronavirus (CoV) preparations human cells tissue culture. Alternatively, SARS-CoV spike protein variants genetically engineered within known “phage display library”. phage virus infects bacteria genetically engineered express exterior coat CoV spike protein large number variants RBD. preparation phage, displaying surface “library” CoV spike protein variants, added human cells laboratory culture conditions order select bind ACE2 receptor. 

This process repeated stringent binding conditions CoV spike protein variants high binding affinity isolated.

Mask=bad disorders extremely regular occurrence linked vaccines. substantial evidence happening

Citation needed, buck-o. social media, blogs, sketchy alt web sites, etc, count. Real scientific studies only.

Also, define terms. exactly constitutes “extremely regular”? much specifically “substantial evidence”? that’s lot words say you’d rather go herd immunity route would kill lot people. Best luck You’re putting way much faith people “question whatever information get”. everyone means, intelligence, schooling yes could understanding. But, people easily manipulated believe stay home mommy vaccines via YouTube legit doctors whole argument becomes national issue everyone. You’re one making lists, me. Don’t project. competition ranking petty. definitely together. metric however useless own; need context able draw conclusions. research like one Umeå useful. able limit variables actually answer questions, hopefully. Goodness gracious great balls fire Ames Iowa city went right nytimes chart worst places last two weeks. Thanks, colleges! Notice lumped Germany North Korea together? end day, every number see screens. Totes. Anything nurtures creative spark it.

On alt accounts, messed around lot r/photoshopbattles. could hours end day. assume 30k people exposed somehow?

THIS... unethical expose people use probabilities statistic determine % would normally exposed use reasonable sample size. assume if, given say 10000 people, 500 would get covid time. LOWER vaccine probably works. Higher BAD. give link saying February airborne?

thanks advance. think important distinction is: know airborne *know* airborne? say: actual solid replicable evidence based reliable studies proved causation heavily suspect airborne? Big difference. Fauci might really believed airborne beginning, without actual evidence studies back reckless make claims based assumptions. could day, picking holes giving solutions. It’s certainly impossible.

Lower-wage workers getting extra unemployment could hide effect, so. Can't Asians succeeding, amirite? guy died January 30th infected 2 weeks before. think right know really went China early months. Trump talks straight asshole. know shit. confirmed anywhere? I'm looking source statement.

It's fine Korean-only source, I'll ask friend translate me. really wish capitalism applied business essentials.

Trump also talks straight asshole, nothing says ever true. call projector

And teacher projector going room full five year olds gets glue, scissors, outlets? might work high school, realize large part teacher’s job keep kids running wild, right?

Who pays shields busses? mean, idk (can’t possibly US, nowhere low virus spread), school funding miserly. Teachers spend money make copies worksheets students money budget. think find money smaller class sizes extra disinfectant masks plastic barriers extra busses allow social distancing?

I think high risk young people common think. mean, many Americans obese? that’s leaving severe asthma (me), immune suppressed, kidney disease, diabetes, etc. - small town Texas. Oddly great. single case schools opened 30 active cases currently. find amazing people problem Fauci trying ration masks health care workers mostly cool trump telling people drink bleach. clarified also said simply know asymptomatic spread rare lack data.  Nice rebuttal bro *some* people *some* businesses.  worse better everyone becoming zombies? active r/conspiracy... That's need know don’t know you’re need help someone does. line thinking may yet another reason people test positive totally asymptomatic need studied long term. still know asymptomatic really truly asymptomatic &amp; pre-symptomatic long 'pre'. Scary stuff... Maybe wrong, saw: woman shows 30% looks fine me, apparently almost obese? examples correct, seems chubbiness obesity measure body fat, would make lot people think slightly overweight actually obese.

I think covid really exposed version capitalism really bad protecting people pandemic. monster needs constantly fed money go.

Too much greed country. There's enough go around shared, don't. bet benches 🍊man Fauci say airborne? know problem ADE occurs? expose participants wild Covid? assume 30k people exposed somehow? U.S. controlled virus enough limit community spread testing/tracing programs maintained masks distancing, we'd able too. back people thought bad smells would drive illness away would congregate around public latrines breathe deep stench. others thought good smells would drive away hence plauge dr would wear leather outfits mask like beak stuffed dried herbs spices. might actually protected leather pants jacket keeping away plague infected fleas.

these days kinds wonderful science give us facts manypeople would rather believe things convient fit current worldview. Depends air circulating around, handwashing, distancing (especially huffing puffing), equipment sanitizing.  already cases deaths world (until India overtakes US), screening international travelers loses purpose.... flip-flpped on?

And something trump hasn't? hold different standards? lol things dont set price, negotiation... thinking ones ""must"" go out. state limited closed entertainment blocks could drink outside extensive. That's fear. kids get it, bring home, infect parents, take work.

I wouldn’t much issue wearing one work, wearing errands like grocery shopping, I’m going movie theater park alone, probably wouldn’t I’m hanging friends dating. Social situations main time think it’d awkward.

Plus Taiwan fraction population US has. Ok apple it, ""develop"" ""create"". China it, ""copy"" ""steal"". One side underplays worst flat ignores reality it. still 30,000-40,000 new cases day US

And that's we're catching testing that's demand driven testing many possible. think seen comment half dozen times least today. I'm curious intel committees told point though. 

It seems Trump briefed pretty well I'm curious info passed gang 8. Alberta - 2018 brutal smoke. That’s started wearing masks public. Good times. know effect vaccine 10/15 years line? Two weeks? Lol sniffles cited common symptom. Sniffles means got another coronavirus, like one causes common cold. 747s 1300s. cars. Ships made wood. Shit much mobile now. Simple stuff, consider. class-action perfect lead plaintiff too, since owner's restaurant Little Neck, Queens, right border Nassau County. 

You could literally walk 500 ft street Nassau County, another 500 ft. Nassau County restaurant indoor dining months, state deemed ""unsafe"" indoor dining Queens restaurant. 

There way state could bullshit way explaining dangerous indoor dining Queens restaurant one 1,000 ft away. companies stage now? I’ve seen promising things setbacks I’ve lost track week now.. 61yo immunocompromised mother finished quarantine testing positive. exposed hospice worker caring grandmother (not covid related). sniffles two days fatigue. never got worse. said tested positive, wouldn’t known. experience outlier. Try panic. China would 800k cases, 6k deaths claim.

that's still far, far better anyone else outside East Asia, it'd forgivable since first discover virus sequence genome everyone else already knew against. Seems work fine countries. still private sector people like faster premium care feel current situation that's acceptable showstopper. occurs 1:100,000 saves 100:100,000, get approved. Virtually every drug body count. Usually anaphylaxis. drugs dangerous fuck (think chemo) benefits (not dying) outweigh risks (maybe dying). test anyone early days. number could 100,000/day, 200,000/day, tf knows honestly. can't look number like 40,000 / day determine that's high not. many people get common cold day? Probably shit ton. There's lot base expectations met last years, I'll take get. move abundance model economics, instead imposed scarcity, complete viciously attention/likes.

Ok. China wanted test 1m day Wuhan.

Personally, think possible UK test China.  inaccurate numbers coming countries.

Nope. end. parents work. said hear, would speak up. mask create sound-proof chamber. like talk old person phone work--they need visual cue, need speak voice clear strong. doubt hardly anyone could read lips, anyway, help remove mask? hate westerners, especially Americans, correlate third-world-country coronavirus success ‘previous virus experience’

Yes, specific countries, may case. definitely case underdeveloped developing countries. 

For insight, 80s saw 

* HIV AIDS outbreak US

* measles outbreak 

Plus, let’s forget polio world wars, H2N2 swine flu back 2009


Belonging third world country, tell happens here

* don’t question healthcare guidelines set state professionals. 

* don’t correlate 5G towers outbreak; don’t believe stupid conspiracies 

* patriotism doesn’t mutate becoming anti maskers calling law enforcers Nazi

* head state didn’t take ~3 months wear mask


My point is, please respect successful management poor countries battled virus. course, third world countries succeeded. 

But causality cannot developed states experience viruses dictate management success, clearly States failed Anyone Indonesia reading this? What's COVID situation like there? I'm suspecting widespread official numbers indicate case many countries. discharged probably know symptoms. Whether related vaccine another question. Although seeing person thousand people got thus far happen unlikely vaccine. We'll probably know next week. work school well. die I’m everything power come back haunt governor, president, superintendent. Imma busy afterlife Jillian Barberie!  Invest cold weather running gear. I'm Chicago run -50 f wind chill blizzard. spend much gear. Layers wool! We’ve 6 months since thing began. government push (or public’s common sense) live healthier life? Instead cower away wash hands nothing..

If can’t respect health enough, someone else? Five years. taught five years. undergrad degree takes four. lost life job barely even knew. Fucking bills hit. Trump pointed intentionally downplaying public, 6 separate large rallies comment Woodward. time called next Democratic hoax. Thanks well fleshed out, sourced reply. 
I say comment latest timeline (seeing vaccine year) might ambitious. 
For sure pulling time, good management message. 
I’ll surprised see viable candidates widely available year - hope proven wrong. refreshing see appears good decision making. 

Took long enough, probably ever gotten here, credit credit due. Basically posts coronavirus US.  India almost 90,000 new cases. many people talk situation India. Correct — blood tests diagnostic. Also, “antibody tests may provide quick results, used diagnose active infection. Antibody tests detect antibodies immune system develops response virus, virus itself. take days several weeks develop enough antibodies detected test.”

Source: likely gives immunity limited time. Take look said Bob Woodward Indeed. also weird people compare huge country small island countries. Like there, wont work here.

Compare Taiwan small state.

But, theory China started get cases, banned foreign travel. course, diseases years similar like swine flu avian flu...that didnt become pandemics. Hindsight 20/20. It’s definitely hard assess - even fancy DEXA scans aren’t known particularly accurate. I’m *really* big fan picture charts, especially women body types/where carry weight much variable men. Notice woman 25% wide hips thicker arms, woman 30% pronounced hourglass shape, woman 40% really slim arms carries weight middle. Also note *huge* difference 40% 45%. Kind sketches out. think also varies race - know Asians considered obese lower weight usual. Anyways, source pulling - yeah, you’re probably better taking account stuff like BMI/blood pressure/resting heart rate/fitness level comes Covid risk. Lol, fat get fucked. Love it. humane viewpoint got there.

Please release method help 140,000,000 Americans go week. make lots money save world. then, masks social distancing (including packing classrooms gills) much accessible solution. avoid giving wrong impression: 28 years old *and* obese. tragic healthy 28 year olds really needn’t start freaking out. High risk teachers include age obese, extra precautions taken them. like attention detail! Hopefully EN (Exposure Notification) Express fix this. iOS, baked OS. Android, auto-generated app. cases, state government hands Google/Apple configuration file Google/Apple handle rest.

You wife people world, affects others. 1. feelings hurt all. I’m trying abide rules sub. hand obviously upset resorting calling names.

2. I’m loyal presidential candidate. think bad. I’m aware United States equipped deal pandemic. Pandemics kill lots people. Spanish Flu killed half million people much deadly Covid 19. I’m realist sense people won’t follow recommendations matter charge. doesn’t give privilege insult state I’m immoral person. article says didn’t contract virus students. end. think China's numbers are? cases beginning- actually NOVEMBER according physician- much worse hit nursing homes . fact 80% total cases (576) nursing homes- residents staff. 
Currently majority positive cases don’t hardly symptoms recoveries occurring quicker new cases . haven’t hospitalization since July. 
We total 45 deaths . 
These numbers entire county 36,000 people. Now, yes.

Its country. 40% Americans 20 obese, puts high risk category. Many Americans asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc... statistical anomaly all. Hiding it. would want reallocated? Genuinely curious. Reallocating social programs usually seen bad new spending. People HOPING would vaccine November. Experts saying would probably longer. something determine own, think so? starts killing disfiguring supermodels. /s question users Asia like Japan Hong Kong Taiwan even China--do cut straps masks prior disposing them?*

I fold used masks inside horizontally (the side facing inside) place inside single square piece tissue, folding tissue top bottom folded mask. fold half tissue vertically time, double-folded mask entirely covered tissue outside. Finally, use two straps left dangling outside tissue fasten whole thing together dispose it.

If done well never touch outside mask beyond sides. still wash hands afterwards, course. Hear hear! Burned account already? Even vaccine deemed acceptable issue, feel would nonetheless great success almost everyone able take risk. theory everyone neurological issues opted yet everyone else got vaccine, virus would mostly disappear anyway. Perfect world, twist politicians’ arms make want?

Tax billionaires, pass UBI duration pandemic (x% population vaccinated, 60 maybe? Plus six months) allows high risk stay home want allows parents stay home supervise distance learning. That’s going work everybody (kids two essential parents, example, kids need occupational speech therapy), community spread allows, also open learning centers kids go Zoom classes classmates. Keep small groups single low risk adult supervise, preferably outdoors spread entire school district necessary space. Provide kids cheap laptops set hotspots around district kids limited internet access. 

Require masks everybody 3 put teeth - fine proportional income, increasing repeat infractions. Similarly, fine people repeatedly host mass gatherings. Remove tax exempt status churches host large weddings violate occupancy distancing regulations. Keep outdoor things spaced open, close bars move last call 10 11 pm - glass wine dinner, don’t go drinking night that’s people get sloppy. Restaurants open takeout patio dining only. Keep event sizes small. Move much outdoors possible, encourage many people possible use curbside delivery options shopping people can’t grocery workers lower risk exposure.

Honestly, UBI isn’t going happen time soon. Less pie sky invest spit test universities using. Virtual school learning centers either there’s vaccine it’s distributed spit testing widely available, test kids (possibly pooled) every day. testing available, increase cap event size everyone tested entry.

At point, though, think fastest solution going vaccine. Bro live Minnesota mentioned SARS, flu. SARS almost identical covid.

I agree, there’s got better way. 

It’s real shit year, sun still comes next day:) Hehehe I'm also South lol contact tracers. Never heard 'em. Sounds like republicanitas :O It’s fear porn. number death projected models way off, lockdowns didn’t prove conclusively effectiveness, produced massive destruction societies economies, mental health crises, spikes suicides etc. 
our response perfectly mirrored worst reactions immune systems: citokyne storm. amputated arm cure paper cut. us Average age dead patients (most often comorbidities) 75. 75. Put gamgam pop pop lockdown... let rest population conduct business. over. cognitive dissonance required simultaneously condemn protests (because politics) time shilling excusing protests riots astounding. mental gymnastics impressive honest. locked keep hospitals overrun. necessary March NYC bad shape.

Hospitals states near peak capacity summer things opened again, seems stabilized bit don’t need second lockdown. average teacher salary north 60k? Granted, average teacher lot older people automatically think 60k still ton, 35-40k literally average salary LOWEST state US objectively wrong. yeah, still make right treated like garbage midst pandemic. since black, Latin, native people breaking law, suddenly cops supporting law breakers. much law order. going turn another lie Fauci? Get someone people trust say things.  misinformation. Contact tracing studies obviously less likely uncover infections. main clinical data emerge, understanding presymptomatic post-symptomatic transmission improve critical future public health initiatives aimed controlling COVID-19 pandemic.

How sub's mods deciding lock thread -- [Woodward book: Trump says knew coronavirus ‘deadly’ worse flu intentionally misleading route people politics thread instead?

The catastrophic shitspigot white house has, intentional lies virus, murdered tens thousands countrymen, knew going March, admission indelibly recorded. somehow none direct relevance course disease US. Canadians must charge here. Definitely hang there, hope everything gets better you, deserve it. think following reasons:

1. **USA out-sized influence** world - people notice things happen, US media (which likely cover US events closely) global reach (whereas Indian media outlets global readership)
2. gonna sound condescending, USA largest economy developed nation - **it supposed able handle better**. India, developing nation, less expectations. result, shocking (and thus news-worthy) USA 
3. **India 4x population USA** \- per-capita basis, 90K still nothing sneeze at, lot less outlier looked per-capita basis Yeah? Wake coronavirus killed one third population. matter believe not. belief useless. effect masks allergies incredible.

If wear mask home bad days/when windows open, need take antihistamine.

Looking forward finding works dog allergies too! Dumb question. I'm live Massachusetts there's many cases go gym. However, basically everyone wears mask people usually pretty diligent spraying equipment use it. really bad conditions? fact transverse myelitis suspected indicates might serious neurological side effects vaccine. Gotcha! No, certainly don’t think banning things would helpful. It’s literature written people, equal books written people. think using religious text absurd considering immense amount shitty things it, translated many times probably don’t even accurately translate point. significant evidence children spread adults. suggests children 10 19 spread disease rate adults, found children carried viral load adults. Israeli schools reopening demonstrated cases largely exploded nearly 2000 cases students staff. 

Finally, research UofF suggests “Our analysis children little bit infectious adults in-house transmission, may tended parents grandparents homes.""

We know he's lying knows what's going china, sees dismisses it, says yah pretty much needed work well. Sounds great!!! See there!!! Fox News? Yeah downvote, even click link. must extremely mild.

You mean like infection supposed prevent?

Maybe he's way old trust 100% cognition? Kind like 75% shitty politicians. add onto this, wife’s first child born last year C-section made sure doctors network whole 8 months. day delivery, first boy born excited! One month later got bill $28,000. know pay something pocket $28,000!? coworker baby 1 month mine paid $3000 everything. 

So naturally called hospital, complained bill. said look it. get call back later saying Anesthesiologists procedure network. shitting me!? made sure EVERY doctor network ONE person surgery didn’t talk network!? Yeah pissed complained hospital Aetna. many back forth 4 weeks dozens angry letter CEO COO, got bill reduced $6000, double budget WAY less initial 28,000.

Is could possibly happened didn’t. agree. aggregation fake numbers leads power. Power others. Honestly though, would function without money? force business shut , they'll place go. Plenty reason doubt really. Primarily business required aim profit everything do. may committed making direct profits it, they’re definitely counting indirect profits. New York’s numbers dropping everyone saying good job Texas’s numbers drop call bull say it’s less testing? “A drug company’s claim it’s providing vaccine cost viewed skepticism used car salesperson,” Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas)

1. deals they’ve made sell profit transparent, outside verification cost. take word they’re selling cost. 

2. Even take word, there’s scrutiny what’s included “cost.” It’s easy jack costs / shift costs around internal accounting purposes make cost drug break even, making profit centers within business profits.

3. They’ve said profit pandemic. said trigger end pandemic pricing pricing pandemic. 

Ultimately, walk away vaccine likely used years years, cost developing drug well infrastructure manufacture distribute fully funded government risk. drug infrastructure value. soon no-profit period ends, literally spin whole business unit billions, there’s profit. Money-grabbers? vaccine free. 
Shady? People Africa got Russian vaccine Ebola would disagree. It’s cases fall pandemic level death rate lower flu. Btw, mention quality life many individuals suffering “recovering” virus.

It’s fear porn factual evidence it. idiocy part problem lingering festering long already. Respect! consider Canada success share massive border USA.

Laos similar population density USA, 32 people per km².

Myanmar's population density 84 people per km².

And dubious Vietnam's numbers, would expect Laos (who shares MASSIVE border Vietnam) trouble well; likewise Myanmar. Regardless, probably non-confirmed cases require hospitalization. would think test would happen admitted. saying months now. shut would quickly reduce positive cases level current testing tracing infrastructure could easily handle. could open almost everything Americans. Also, supply chain resilient. 

Some like say, ""Well, economy? can't another lock down."" say, 25% risk close someone risk. people currently locked down. go retail shops, restaurants, gyms, etc, 50% less capacity. mandate, fear. 

I agree open-now folks one thing, 95% locked 4 weeks bad. simple math shows 30% participating economy year far worse. 

That said, would need national leadership institute national lock down. then. now. states islands. Without national leadership, locking would like playing whack-a-mole. Strap in. We're ride end. Crap, sorry, I've upset you, I? Okay, bad. clearly knows everyone. He's super smart. stop buying masks **because work**

WHERE SAY THAT. 

Your quote Surgeon General Jerome Adams, Fauci. provided link tweet.

Whoever bribes right people money win. elections real pro wrestling. really deserve Nobel. 0.03% young adults God comments make lose hope humanity. tell ya what, hearing people talk breathe masks excuse wearing figured anti-maskers making excuse. However, gyms opened area we're forced wear mask whole time totally relate. masks, especially breathing heavy hot, absolutely restrict airflow point least discomfort worst hyperventilation. can't imagine wearing anything expensive mask extremely good airflow participating sport requires shit ton cardio.

I'm sure see people stupid cant wear masks properly right now. 

Something better nothing. ounce prevention worth pound cure. personally think requiring masks earlier would led less need hospitals.

This, 100%. gonna lie stopped reading half way. read message first. never argued except say one single metric enough making decisions of. original post mention percent positive ask ok open based metric alone. saying use multiple metrics deciding simple answer equation balancing multiple metrics once.

Edit cuz I'm still shitting: read rest response. Good sources, gonna save next idiot says big deal go them. Thanks quick response, sorry came rude I've heard herd immunity requires 70% vaccines important. 

Am reading right? seems like research makes assumptions population behavior. really able understand take time get meant homogeneity etc. sounded like expectation people continue social distance wear masks pushes number 20%-30% classical 60%-70%. missing something? that's case seems like stretch expect United States (or bunch countries).

Ditto like 0 common sense anymore know bother. officially announced covid airborne couple weeks back, telling people since March sub data China Europe indicated that, holy shit downvote central people telling crazy 6 feet distance plenty, even linked studies.

People generally healthy still get really sick.
Covid isn’t death asymptomatic case. wide range symptoms, severity recovery time. press briefing held Wednesday, September 09 headquarters National Health Security Agency (ANSS), head unit responsible monitoring evaluating management diseases epidemic potential, Dr Dimai Ouo Kpamy , reveals date, cases re-infection covid-19 recorded different epidemiological treatment centers Guinea, amount 15.
""  Since start Coronavirus pandemic today, 9009 cured, able total 15 cases re-infection covid-19, ie rate 0.16% compared total number patients recovered  "" revealed 
Continuing, doctor, specialist public health, invited people cured covid-19, respect barrier measures, recalled coranavirus immunizing disease.
“  When cured coronavirus, probability high re-infected 3 months. The coronavirus immunizing disease, exceed 3 months. So barrier measures respected, recontact disease. We must slap chest say longer contract disease leaving epidemiological treatment center. This interesting. We must continue respect barrier gestures,  ”he stressed.
To date, Guinea 9,848 confirmed cases, including 9,009 declared cured. sharp decrease inner city, much suburbs. Here's article: experience, congestion _increased_ lines compared last year. Remember Stockholm still growing. Well, concerned pet's impact environment, definitely [don't recommend getting dog carful around people, bur wary eat too? crazy scale 0 Trump, seems pretty normal  Guarantee people reading headline believe state Florida they’re referring to. new tape? can't keep Ya might need go ahead shut again. Second option spread virus till new president charge go ahead shut again. Admittedly, half truth. Obviously masks WORK healthcare workers need them! (And recall, Fauci said ""don't need them"", ""don't work general public""... Surgeon General Jerome Adams... capslock meltdown Twitter back February appear public without wearing one, even giving speech? He's WAAAAYYYYY annoying Fauci.)

But problem people dumb think deeper that. hear, ""oh okay, I'm gonna go stay home feel sick... I'll fine!""

And add mean medical industrial complex trying make profit.

Im exposed COVID daily basis ED 4 week old daughter home whose already serious respiratory issues. offered one leading vaccines reputable developer (not Kodak), id probably take it. However fault 25 year old single colleagues medical comorbidities waiting see longer term studies committing taking brand new vaccine. think see people making personal choices risks: elderly high risk people wont around several decades arent going care COVID vaccine causes increased rates osteosarcomas three decades line young healthy people arent risk dying COVID less likely take vaccine. Anybody expecting 100% proven demonstrably safe vaccine risk long term side effects widespread compliance immunization naive. Someone going visited redneck militias soon. Sporting events (at least pro level) thing makes sense list, form bubble created (whether league wide bubble like NBA team-specific one). Obviously, I'm counting fans (if mean fans allowed, makes absolutely sense).

Universities would make sense bubble, that's much harder do. technically possible though.

Everything else makes zero sense. many people coming together going back homes after, there's way make bubble (maybe office, labor laws get way that). consider people household go different locations, add many potential ways spread COVID.  “While gone us soon, Ms. Bannister’s legacy lives lives students taught five years dedicated educator. honor Ms. Bannister’s memory ask Richland Two family join reaffirming commitment provide premier learning experiences students safest environment possible part slow spread COVID-19.”

Like bro brother literally greater risk dying virus are, taking precautions can, you’re actively going gym several times week laugh wearing mask. much asshole gonna feel like cause brother’s death/sever illness convinced hoax couldn’t bothered wear mask didn’t wanna “sheep” Oh great. That’s am. I’ll definitely check out. I’ve also seen billboard i4 advertising 15 minute results idk one free. It’s hard tell too. think it’s end world doesn’t mean that’s reality we’re in. Try anyway, it’s original source  bit topic, wondering...

From understanding, countries like South Korea Taiwan effective minimizing COVID spread/deaths also keeping business open. believe Taiwan fact also lockdown. discussion always insane restrictions lockdown (like EU countries/US/etc.) vs. high death rates soft lockdowns (Sweden) countries Asia seemed able effectively? still enough energy left panic? Well, incoming international travelers reduce infection level US. 100% fucked matter turns November.

At least virus might (better) control? Eugh.  don’t point caring. Fuck weak ass attitude. thing kills. Stay vigilant. Forever need be. Apart paywall issue, actually read original paper. it’s interesting. Here: commentary excellent ITP: large majority House Representatives chamber Congress controls budget process. also 2/3rds Senate well.

They also happen majority control major city state-level governments across nation.

So yeah, much 'in power' despite myopic view things. agreeing vaccine great. what, two-three weeks schools started up?  Huh, go figure. fuck told aerial spread though already knew shit FEBRUARY SEVENTH.

Because Trump administration. given situation worst thing possible personal petty reasons. Hey, chief. I'm millennial asthma.

Lol, irony original comment criticizing deliberately making mine specific apparently get why, putting words calling idiot. Like wow. Worth noting unrelated vaccine lol district title 1, get mad require supplies. Yet they're somehow expecting kids go get tested? official positives, I've plenty probable cases class. Yeah, travellers would reduce infection level US right now. mean Trump poor odds, shit headed wrong direction. equally good imo Neither, they'd slowly plateau ran testing supplies. sad... article says got sick kids came back classroom? it’s sad 34 year old woman died good person happened teacher. shouldn’t present woman died went back work teacher already sick school started. Many Americans vehemently antivaxx, maybe enough vaccines limited help America general. Even studies show they’re effective considerably safer develop immunity catching disease , still won’t get prefer children develop immunity naturally, even stuff that’s highly likely kill child render massively disabled, like polio.


And likely able afford vaccine know it’ll likely sold eye-wateringly high price due politicians charge country moment caring profit money lives people living country 🤷🏻‍♀️. Theres 250k excess deaths america sonfar year. cares secondary contributing factor. People conveniently forget this. Hello, I'm country bar workers restaurant workers get living wage, instead relying tips.

Our mandatory minimum wage around 400 euros, bar workers get around 450, restaurant workers around 500 euros pay winter months. six months season (since tourist destination), pay goes around 1000-1200 euros per month.

And guess what? People still tip. Less USA admitedly, almost one walks restaurant without tipping least something, seasons working restaurant bartender, I'd double pay tips, getting around 10-15% cut waiters. goes bars summer. winter, waiters get maybe ten euros night tips, getting around 20-30 weekend days, working bar people go weekend. ten euros usually get day enough cover food expenses day living alone. Meaning pay, even months payed less, sitting mostly untouched paying bills expenses.

I know, sounds better relying luck generosity people. Hopefully vaccine ineffective, unlike “aid” sent countries publicity. use low cost tools available i.e. wearing masks social distancing. would priority, economy would better would opportunities socializing. 2 tools politicized message disdain whitehouse. possibility herd immunity vaccine risky best  quote comment you:

Americans a) susceptible scary headlines clickbait, meaning trick drive traffic, b) current media political climate created strange situation one ""side"" tries downplay risks, reaction side tries describe worst case scenarios? Personally think b, would interesting hear perspective someone enjoys types articles rather ""dry"" statistical reporting. teach? OK, that's still reason feel shame. believe Albert Einstein also helped study, actually commissioned Abe Lincoln Lou Bega. also found hot lunches attract corona virus, providing lunches, safe. can't understand schools opening doors maskless students. teach town 'green' (\~2 cases per 100,000 per week) hybrid set (half kids half home), masks, strict distance guidlines. That’s admirable choice COD zombies? Nope don’t mental capacity understand severity due head firmly placed sun doesn’t shine. see heavily depends audience remote learning except labs. transmission traced classes. scientific problem, social one. It’s looking like virus may become endemic, without vaccine. what? Stay home much humanly possible forever? may that, I’m not. Many people not. species needs social communion, culture commerce thrive. 

We need find balance, many countries Europe doing. point “saving lives” cancel living. 2 choices: 

* Wuhan style lockdown 
* Kept economy going little change (Sweden) 

We neither. Instead half assed stay home orders reopened quickly, making everyone sick destroying businesses &amp; people’s livelihoods. seem little bit fear mongering? mean school last 6 months. None theses deaths directly tied “school” - happen teachers died COVID. 3.7M teachers USA that’s roughly 1% population - almost 200000 dead - 1% 20,000 - 3 dead teachers - RELAX 

I’m aware 60% deaths 80 10% 60 - even numbers talking 1% 20,000 death 200. 3 deaths. Geee, ya think? Louisiana, look chart. Alabama Oklahoma. 

There quite states looked like going right direction swing. No, literally saw China Asians countries wore masks explicitly said going copy them. pretend ignorant. literally finally started new job trying find one long. entirely feasible take longer. Good luck 👍 stay safe plagues among Native Americans even worse. Black Death killed 1/3 population Europe. epidemics among Native Americans may killed 90% population within century Europeans arrived. Imagine epidemics killed almost 300 million Americans, 7 billion people worldwide. Wisconsin like Illinois, better point, doubt we'll ever fully taking again. Hold elected officials responsible both? Allow deliver liquor, keep place closed customers.  obvious everyone much invested stop now. Thank demonstrating Fauci made pandemic worse chose lie us beginning saying masks didn’t work. Fuck Fauci. Thank god. Someone common sense. I'm going waste time idiot says flu disappear therefore covid won't. sure find 10k students test easily, sure campus? Fixed it, thanks! Didn’t Stephen Hawking die 2 years ago? America really next level dumb year. great. millions folks think protected crossing border. ""No cases school"" something keeps said, nobody sort monitoring randomized testing.

For know, children asymptomatically spreading every day other, taking home parents grandparents people keep claiming ""but there's evidence schools!""

You evidence without testing. No, Vietnam deserves it. terrifying, FSU 40k students. think sec. Jesus Christ would comical bad we’re fucking wasn’t serious. exactly would get right? always hear people bitching many people died, never hear anyone say think could actually prevented people dying. please, give answer satisfy assertion virus could defeated political means. ultimately comes types statements about. Politics. sound like students. Seems like school trying protect community. wear mask use common sense public situations, there's much research behind it. People get this.

People try link studies say masks work, every single one seen far data conclusive.

They tend look like this:



Masks shown reduce transmission influenza virus.

We found studies, showed masks reduce rate infection.

Buuuuut, studies really accurate really know masks fit patient properly wore times close contact someone. Fellow IL here. St Louis's contagion spread dragging IL down. fair UIUC dragging numbers way high testing kind averages out. well, since Mao, party general secretary, even though official limit, term president. 10 years done.

Your argument simply technicality, change fact Xi remain power life, whatever power labeled. response across entire state absolute fucking joke One lie CDC Jan/Feb disastrous consequences mons after. Okay people overweight mildly obese higher chance dying someone normal BMI range. It’s severely obese maybe lack exercise actually causes health issues. cant get much neurological damage got brain explains much.

(born raised mid-MO) Same. minor setback course sucks. guess whose vaccine I'd rather injected family veins rather shitty-ass russian vaccine that's probably going show adverse affects road.

The fact paused trial publicly released news tells us vaccine legit gets. ALLOWED buy N95? mean they're available (and I've heard multiple claims supposedly aren't) tell that's absolutely true. bought wear everywhere.

But yeah. infuriates one realizes number one way ""stop spreading coronavirus"" GETTING IT. reading bunch articles sounds like (especially serious) side effects reported. participants.  serious side effects trials paused determine it’s linked vaccine. Yes, said could something positivity rate dropping 5% well reduced tests. FSU.  happen every college kids avoiding tests get traced parties disciplined. 1. referring making money unethically. specific scenario. bad. arguing you.

2. See, bad anti vax movement too. I'm anti vax. all. I'm date recommended get flu shot every year. gives fuel shit like happens. good.

I've never sore arm flu shot, I'm lucky. think implications would 40% people got fever? area expertise.

3. scary trials Oxford halted. Again, know, lot saying necessarily big deal, definitely bit disheartening. I'm still hopeful, though.

Edit: third point displaying 1? Lol Now, tell said I’m bigger, better person? Arguing would prove otherwise. 

I appreciate invite look toys though, gotta pass, time. I’m sure one day I’ll brain dead ecstatic take offer. read recently (so take grain salt) almost 3000 died flu Denmark 17/18 season. would correspond 5000 deaths Sweden. seems like Sweden handled flu pretty well last couple decades, example 1000 dying 17/18. Thanks! It’s possible got placebo knows maybe got real one side effects. I’m getting second dose tomorrow feeling nervous it, thanks well wishes. Governors don’t give shit confirms belief one X vaccinations cause serious disease. guys seriously understand argument?  Americans aren’t built long haul. can’t it. restless. concerned ourselves, others. Even promask group, tired it. too. I’m ready open let chips rally may. fee bad that. parents high risk. people love high risk. I’m tired fighting people think it’s big deal. Data come past months showing following:

* Fomite (surface) spread rare

* Asymptomatic spread rare

* Pre-symptomatic spread responsible ~11% cases, almost always spread home 

So still acting like need treat every human planet likely contagious? Test quarantine anyone symptoms, keep distance strangers public. it’s time move crazy restrictions let life move on. would love tell think is, rabbit hole explore come conclusion intuition right (and November) none verifiable plus outside scope subreddit. say Truth come light incredibly dark things going long humanity Earth, core political systems establishment media more, COVID attempted tool well smokescreen combat same. Misphrased intro, agree. Dudes... what? people even //trying// there?  click things see dumb person looks real life. didn’t disappoint No, grocery shoping allowed, adviced go alone.

E: Disclaimer: state (BaWü), could Bavaria strict, think heard then. u/HappyBavarian probably knows that. virus would target willing choose death ""liberty"" would've worked February March.

Would have, though? countries able tiny mostly islands. need stay away r/conspiracy. sound like fool. PS: unemployed moms I’d call research. Plus 25% places anyway. Hudson Valley 50% technically, I've personally witnessed 75-80 several places. someone used obese, eat less move more. 

The rest mental. it. :( Kids learning home BS.

My kid private school like normal.

I feel terrible kids though. buried end...maybe knew low efficacy vaccine FDA prepared approve, get shot [unlikely fully t**he FDA prepared approve vaccine that’s least 50 percent effective—a level comparable current flu shots.** imperfect vaccine still useful. I’d look expert credibility. wouldn’t look PCP’s word top infectious disease doctor. drop cases large explained small drop testing. See throat. assumed cold felt like post nasal drip. got worse got tested. hope cough corona. hesitate get tested, even peace mind. really. surprised little Trump made public. they're stuck paying 10 grand 8 dollar test? 

Because pay 10 grand. probably pay cost. 

They negotiated rates pay fraction do. insane pricing make uninsured patients pad pockets. 

I refuse pay full price medical bill usually tell fuck already got paid insurance unless actually something help me. it? gym things I’ve fence. I’m home workouts, want squat rack back. they've publicly rebuked president last days. That's really good sign. 

I hope stay strong, facing incredible political pressure. far seem standing it. hope keep it. I'm going rick health purely hope. Okay Karen. think tiny amount votes stood Trump presidency. 

More people died Covid number votes needed tip 2016 election away Trump.

“Elections consequences.” billed? send bill email mail? There’s way US lock again, even levels leadership page. can’t even convince people wear masks, impossible convince people stay home. Hmm believe redditor 100% less qualifications man served life purpose it? don’t.

Authority nothing it. Credibility bozo. 

Motives conflict interest? hope you’re Trump guy. would ironic cherry top case time. Anyways, companies past happened. So, no, don’t care conflicts interest given he’s speaking truth.

Leave basement. mentioned, forced go prepare school virtual learning Aug 27-28th. Died 7th, 10 days later. fucked stories. There’s link cause he’s fucking liar would've worked February March. Now? shutdown like one described article would create shitshow even worth point. would disaster. Mask wearing proving effective. True, restaurants upstate Long Island nearing full capacity, 25%. wouldn’t anything around people end quarantine there’s reason around meantime. shit. what's point? 

You think people save world vaccine get Nobel prize? would sit well either. sure lax were/are though - mobility data seen elsewhere seems like nearly everyone wearing masks awhile now. country also sort lockdown varying degrees. 6 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. TLDR: 7 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 15 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Translation:

They’re aggressively testing there’s problem hit brakes. Months areas. posted article ago still believe data. Gg😂 could leave bowl outside like lazy people uncommmon college grads though. Definitely problem year recession type years though.  anyone remember days bees dying alarming rate? Using “hospitalized” (the worst cases) data set? holding shark week mask Welcome shameless America voters reasonably intelligent stuck watching Fox News CNN day. somehow people started voting best interest. elected officials gave flying fuck thought donors thought.  unlimited examples things said done elected officials 100% disqualify holding elected position meant nothing.  still there. Oh wanna know group determine information viable isnt?

Personally find data unreliable impossible interpret inconsistency way things reported calculated site site. Instead, i've picked couple sites keep tabs time compare trends time.

The rest 'information' essentially noise me. teacher friends:

*Shit first week school! Better bring A-game! I'm organized! new shiny shoes new scarf! gonna die! usually drink much work! children counting me. want anymore. Stress? DONT KNOW MEANING WORD* Florida Governor Man weird I'm person who's spent adult life dealing depression anxiety affected slightest. anything freeing outside everyone else anxious (previously never left house daylight hours work nights avoid people). 

I go pick prescription today went town centre first time 6 months. saw handful people wearing masks, particular age range demographic really much lower 1% people around. 

When lockdown first discussed UK government demonstrated understanding public fatigue think things considered 6 months people decent job keeping sensible social distancing.

People know type get militant ignore advice people happened lose family members early pandemic, can't say know anyone personally would willingly act outside current social norms.

I happy rapid reaction local lockdown policy, seems sensible. I'm hardcore leftie first criticise tories, overall unhappy managed, probably they've enacted pretty socialist policies. That's fine, long also say riots BLM done definitely also super spreader events. true. Yoda say something effect light dark sides two sides coin, one could exist without other, ultimate goal achieve balance - eradicating Dark Side? Secondly patients, therefore easy new spread pick speed.

Dr. Tegnell sorta pulled ass given know infected different strains. Hopefully one brings new strain country. Hope remove comment guy commented too, please. We're Europe yes white rifles health system needs focus reducing obesity ever. COVID essentially accelerated timeline various health issues arise obesity. ready quit teaching, husband lost job week school started, felt like didn’t choice. 

I’m right work state union beyond useless. Besides that, many coworkers problem virus pleading “the kids need us!” Yeah, need us alive! 

I don’t know. There’s good answer except government stepping fuck up. I’m tired reading online “teachers strike, quit scared, blah blah.” Yes, should. unions purposefully beaten back power, leaving every man himself. cannot ask one teacher walk door without support colleagues, going do? Either find another job (I looked summer; good luck that) suck fear show work. fucking are. acting like new phenomenon coronavirus? that's way US operated long while. I've never paid markets ""say"" I'm worth, people know consistently underpaid. Probably far workers jobs, that's certainly true quality jobs entire working life. Maybe know involvement Wuhan lab started ? real tragedy could avoided. Technically anger sense ""anger exists set emotional reactions news"", main one anger. different ""anger Red Cross mishandles medical supplies"" ""anger Dr. Li dies"" ""anger local govts paused case reporting four days"", even though formal phrasing looks same.

Edit: also, anyone, people question different Dr. Li included, namely Dr. Li Lanjuan. do, well Onion? many times need see ""bars want open, bars fuel epidemic, bars lose business shut down"" cycle?

It's dangerous airborne virus preexisting immunity. Operating mass gathering business *never* work. like things may stay closed forever. random Reddit user find names internet Google search, Russia already knows. Well, since think Americans value teachers all? They're poorly paid daycare. Stop propaganda. fear mongerers inflicting untold psychological damage children right pushing virus narrative. seem remember another headline 15 cases big deal though. “Data tests conducted Sept. 2 yet available, according university’s dashboard.”

It’s Sept 9th!! effective strategy! Understandable .. last week saw first friend since mid-Feb — took walk together outdoors, masked, feet apart whole time. hard. 

This governments really need step PSAs (Public Service Announcements) featuring best-loved celebs sports, film, tv, authors musicians, broad enough range reach widest audience, hopeful, heartening, encouraging message ***need*** keep up, bit longer. 

The everyone sticks handful pandemic health measures, likely avoid shut downs closings. sure much reddit... supposed play way saying reddit member dumb. Every time someone dies flu, they’re endpoint chain infection. never thought call links chain murderers before. different Covid? Deliberately infecting someone obviously shitty thing do, inadvertent transmission inevitable consequence sharing planet microbes use us hosts. 

This new covid morality, views everyone web infection murderers, simply unworkable. Taken logical conclusion means never leave house. never guarantee we’re free infection transmit pathogen someone else. local teachers union made agreement would cooperate current going back school plan order leniency next time wage talks came around. screwed every risk teacher going money instead protecting members. know. hell talking them?

some scientists university are, (not all) trials overseen US company, various governments thrown tons money already.

in end, trusting scientists win fame fortune come first drug companies. plus regulatory bodies, ones like FDA might even use EUA even data. teacher (NYC) illegal strike. assume applies states, though I'm sure that. got nose far Trump's ass feels like anything wants. does. :( People still cloth masks all-sewing-machines-mobilized period time, right? health experts told black people gather streets? Well makes sense since problem US them. live area schools given waivers kids classroom. issue people choose live sticks. case, internet. solution provide air cards students internet. even work residents even get cell service live, hence waivers person classes. Another issue they're dealing residents using air cards normal day day internet stuff fighting limited bandwidth.  lambast fuckers every opportunity get, vote accordingly trying mod proxy. rules. 

And yes, clearly delicate political feelings hurt want censored.  Beg differ you. I’m constant added stress due Covid &amp; chance democracy dead T/GOP MOC re-elected. Others worried GETTING food table keeping shelter heads. happening impacting BP. 94% people stabbed death die bleeding. 6% die stabbing. See. told you. Stabbing way overblown hoax. Haha. Owned libs. Well Reagan fire air traffic controllers.

""Most"" strike unless sure everyone else strike them. can't enforce without union. Correct, say anything bad Sweden's situation Swedes run like hoard downvote you. it?  county part teachers union. one sueing Ron desanta pretty small.  No, shouldn’t. capacity look local level. schools person schools business person. Look prevalence case numbers percent positive community. would say newspaper miswriting. Indeed known long time, evidence show 110% lied this. Anyone still says “oh didn’t know....” lying going evidence contradicts title clearly says ""say Swedes"". overall bad headline/article. NJ decent amount Youth Sports going on, baseball / flag football, outdoors obviously, distanced best possible, coaches masks etc - made busy baseball season unscathed believe (in district , can't speak all). Now, stuff like winter basketball, tough one, unless kids coaches, one else...no way. Yea, leaked audio saying deadly C19 &amp; it’s much worse flu(from Feb/Mar) - around time said publicly it’s flu disappear. 

Not really surprise liar, evidence support well known thing. countries get COVID control vs US clear gets Secretary Education President implied acceptable loses. DeVos said children carriers. possible? feel legal. Add another reason never want get it. India even developing vaccine. article posted sub early year Brit living Wuhan contracted virus. mentioned kitten died sick.  actually small percentage americans anti-vaxers appearance ruch market make great majority americans sitting wating next year take vaccine distrust Govt agencies used political extensions current ocupant white house That's craziest title. people 55? early hard numbers calculate pandemic.

Full stop. rest article anecdotal bullshit. nickel every ""I'm emergency room doc..."" opinion pieces, I'd worry unemployed currently. I'm sure trust source linked here, say really focusing actual science instead ""me colleagues came cool idea, bro,"" clouds real science anecdotes non-science. 

Not mention really news. sub follow guy posting stats state. Sure enough, anyone 60 likely suffer worse 60. ain't really news. 

Articles like helpful, I'm sayin. think extent lies coming out. care joke, echoing active foreign disinformation campaigns designed 1) hurt America's image, 2) divide us one another, 3) contribute actual people dying.

You're tacitly contributing deaths Americans. That's gross. reminder nobody safe. Stay fuck home. morons Ireland demanding proof, clue shout want proof again. I'm confused, supposed trust numbers reported around here? seems they're lower, comments rack stats juked, times (like see big positivity rate title) accepted discussed like fact. wanna know group determine information viable isnt? Haha... Well, honest, dont miss away Hamilton. grew Lindenwald, next old George washington jr high, hayes elementary schools. believe gone now. Whats creepy old buddy mine went school with, Forensic Files found skull linden lake, us natives called ""gravel pit"". remember told story didnt believe him. seeing episode pop TV, kinda freaked bit since lived right area. havent seen talked since high school idea Tim days. digress... look BU’s positivity rate. currently hybrid approach semester students choose person virtual, students change choice time. 

Cumulative positivity rate 0.1%. Yesterday’s positivity rate 0.04%. Pretty remarkable they’ve done. Full disclosure, go school. manufacturing developing thing. need new leadership. Otherwise millions die, drowning bodily fluids. inexcusable leadership top whose focus stockmarket. could REAL leader US could well Low income minorities disproportionately affected obesity, hence higher rates issue young people (at least UK) *not* we’re taking seriously. Everyone know is. 

The issue told go back work (thus travelling busy public transport); go bars pubs restaurants help economy; go back school. 

The virus isn’t around older people don’t go work. Government essentially blaming us taking advice. It’s absurd. cases keep dropping tho. hm. 60 years Trump currently tweeting New York isn’t opening back fast enough. 21% deaths us 65.

79% deaths us 65.

45% deaths long term care facilities. Fuck economy, grandma important. reason currently 15 airports allow international travellers come country. US wants allow airports international air travel restart would extremely costly facilitate current testing policy airports. 

Furthermore, 675,000 tests performed inbound passengers, ~15 tested positive. government’s argument therefore huge waste resources.

Source Dutch: P.s. don’t make political. don’t care democrats republicans.

Edit: original source I'm guessing paediatricians really children, right? Certainly UK, we're facing debate, striking infrequently staff mentioned government talking schools.

Won't somebody please think children! easy point-scoring, like saying hardworking Americans instead Americans.

I dispute point may gotten it, schools part debate, mystery could done.... that's comedy. current leadership, COVID continue unabated well next year whether vaccines released supposed get report school opened students past Tuesday, report yet. wondering ""protecting elderly work"", we're seeing pattern nearly every first world country second hump. Cases come down, young people lower guard, young people get infected, infect old people. know follows Covid starts hitting old mean *just* found out? something new come out? Otherwise haven’t *known* much Trump lying us? You’re probably right. sad. 28. Fake news. Many people telling tremendously safe event, probably safest world. Yes, Miami also Hamilton well. least was. know, career day field trips Elementary school. Back Hayes Elementary still existed. moved area years ago, think finally tore Hayes down. digress... yep, seasonal flu takes older people well higher rate 

It's mall three them!  I’m guessing people think somehow support California GOP senator, I’m not. think it’s proof she’s **doubly** stupid, actually, she’s exposing **again**. Let’s pretend covid doesn’t exist 😂 literally exercise caution, regulatory. living color better Madtv still really good. think depends country, look Argentina, still lockdown, still without able control curve, huge recession due lockdown six months Depends roll out. 100 million doses (at least) leading vaccine due delivered December/January. Smaller state. Florida 3x many cases fudging numbers since beginning.

Tell Trump said tape? like protests ""allowed."" Let us know get shot rubber bullets tear gas trick treating. paid write comments? job? Apparently Transverse myelitis, guy neurological issues beforehand could cause that. seems like depending day week say something different. Thanks. looked available programs, requirements like behind payments situation would definitely qualify. utilities would absolute last worries. also limited funds assistance want taking someone who's worse shape am.

I'm really wondering programs help someone like financial ability weather storm little longer, marketable work-from-home skills, good head shoulders, zero experience working outside structured corporate environment salaried employee. 

I looked self employment training offered WA State ESD started get excited, turned something else, thought (how self employed already successful people suddenly lost job) seem exist. reddit put dude's dick throats? I'm industry; Phase 3 larger test groups, much diversity dosing changes well. test groups start represent general population accuracy. start seeing adverse affects. heartbreaking things fail phase 3. products make past point.  again, voice reason fact. common practice drug trials purpose moving trial forward, derailing literally news. search astrazeneca. Really? 
That good. 
An admission fault super important. 
I haven’t keeping televised speeches / interviews since probably late April... Damn, I’m sorry got fucked like that. There’s gotta better fucking way this. Yeah United States. Fair say “ready October”
Just available mass roll till Spring next year earliest. approval rating Stage III vaccines 50-60%. drugs much, much less. It’s rare Already r/agedlikemilk EUA they’ll immendiantly start distributing risk/health care workers. Hence they’ve planning distribution late October Wrong everything posted basically done straws grasp getting jokey hahaha get rekt next time research buddy. guy pretends know things. faith zoomers generation good impulse control answers *everything*. least always seem know whose fault that. it’s pretty hard search something without name, especially vaccine without published data. Mind posting link, I’d appreciate it. I’ve never heard say wrong Lol gets proven wrong throws tantrum Human error. happens Right winter. Way go. Who's wise idea this? Oh dear. Everyone dog wanting divest UK, clearly lunatics really taken asylum. Usually though, lot inertia - employees settled families, strong business relationships, etc, etc. coronavirus comes along burns everything ground. reason anyone rebuild anything UK now. Good god, bad person. Like, really bad.

Once move abundance model economics, instead imposed scarcity, complete viciously attention/likes. willingness accept wrong change course definition properly science though... June July went gym 4 times week (had membership cancelled April May) . Masks required (I don’t live US, no-maskers don’t exist really). late July city large outbreak, gym related decided risk cancelled membership. couple weeks I’d quit, gym outbreak, one went to, still. risky. Bars, restaurants, gyms, anywhere heavy breathing people without masks (drinking eating), dangerous hell you’re asking get covid go places.

If guys looking simple home workout stuff, there’s TONS literally TONS FREE plans. Don’t buy crap. Arnold posted one reddit sub April (maybe March forget). That’s use, works well. It’s muscle building oriented would expect you’re interested cardio something, maybe look elsewhere. go walk outside lol. It’s consistency much workout versus do. There’s magic plan better everything else. quite unfortunate, similarity words ""tampon"" ""tampone"". say that. way draw words shows clear lack ability conduct discourse; read more. wish healthfulness family matter it’s idiotic statement make. You’re naive think anybody put “all chips” one scenario overcome virus. I’m sure realize that, wouldn’t want take away 6 months expertise. like 10 years....20 years maybe....there's going documentaries COVID-19 they're showing Trump saying shit like ""It's going magically disappear"" endless bullshit people seriously even believe even possible. Sure. time second wave many places? Sounds great. 1) top science executives sold stocks 8 person press release release full phase data, worse misleading press release.

2) 100% people side effects medium dose focusing on, including 40% fevers. That's normal.

3) executive sell schedule law. change schedule days press release accelerate sales would mostly gone full phase data put out. That's sketchy hell.

Pretty sure I've argued reddit someone said think fair got DUI sitting light someone wrecked them, cops arrested DUI guy got away reckless. hard take anything money motivated comment.

Sure, isolating patients going cause stress don’t fucking alternative, it’s still death pandemic.  reality vast majority deaths nursing homes people get covid deteriorate result. Suggesting otherwise fucking stupid know it. someone heart attack wasn’t positive ends collateral damage. don’t know, maybe.  still haven’t provided fucking alternative response pandemic scenario it’s kind pointless. record, 1% hospitalization rate followed 15-20% long term health effect issue category still pretty big deal. actually take covid test turn positive, rate hospitalization actually higher that. numbers way high mess given talking airborne contagion effective transmission influenza significant margin.  please, tell intend solve indirect illness issues without actually increasing deaths directly tied covid? Remember Trump said: Less testing = Less cases? 

Europe slow testing. virus impedes rights 'Murican, shoot dead tracks. enough  Nope, they're still nowhere near it. likely people engaging safer practices, positive effect. actually ""horror"" fake outrage like Obama's suit Trump's steaks? know one person think America serious obesity problem.

The US travels pretty openly around world.  hard time picturing world every country closes boarders citizens start acting right. (I guess possible, statistically seems unlikely).

Also, remember, cases vaccine make immune. usually make symptoms less severe. (i.e. still transmit tge disease). Also vaccines usually best 75% effective, transmitting anti-vaxers... unlucky ones.

Sadly, think virus us long time. would hope do. experience, ""Preprint"" used refer paper accepted publication, yet typeset. also used refer galleys / proofs sent publisher paper already passed muster peer review, yet published, hence ""preprint."" impression though mean something different ""preprint.""  

Peer review trivial formality. Hopefully catches inappropriately causal language. reviewed papers, Ph.D. level scientists Ph.D. candidates, assumed causation performed ANOVA rather multiple regression.  Science observations, analysis, inference. makes fewest assumptions possible.  would like know arrived causal statements.... see supported arguments. would true successful. not.  get vaccine everyone, maybe. know different strain? are. live near university lot Asian (many rich, obv) international students they're still partying hardly see wear masks often hanging friends without distancing.

Despite much research, imperfect vaccine available dengue fever (it limited efficacy cause nasty side-effects). 1987 first trial hiv vaccine began Maryland. Three decades later, cupboard remains bare.  news covid-19 two new papers encouraging. first, written team scientists decode genetics, Icelandic company, published *New England Journal Medicine*, reports antibody levels 1,200 Icelanders infected sars-cov-2 virus recovered. 90% tested positive antibodies twice—once immediately post-infection four months later. People suffered serious disease, hospitalised, developed higher levels antibodies. men older people, greater risk severe illness.  four-month lifespan cheering two reasons. Antibodies hang around likely offer immunity. means vaccine provokes production provide reasonably long-lasting protection. also easier find. suggests results population-wide antibody screening programmes, aim chart spread virus, fairly accurate.  second study, scientists led Tao Dong, immunologist Medical Research Council (mrc), Britain, went hunting t-cells. get less press antibodies, play equally vital role battling infections securing long-term protection. (Their importance vividly demonstrated hiv, targets kills them.)  described *Nature Immunology*, researchers compared blood samples 28 mild 14 severely ill covid-19 patients, well 16 healthy donors. paper describes “robust” t-cell response infected people and, Icelandic work, different responses developed mild severe cases illness. Specifically, mild cases characterised cd8+ cells, kill infected cells directly, rather cd4+ ones, regulate immune response generally. mrc study found t-cells could recognise eight separate parts virus, including spike protein allows penetrate human cells. target list could offer useful hints refining vaccines future.  Edwards, immunologist turned biochemical engineer University Reading (who involved either paper), cautiously optimistic. immune response disease seems working roughly expected, says. continues, vaccines developed trigger long-lasting immunity work—at least theory.  practice, still early celebrate. Dr Edwards warns immunology never predictive science. test show definitively vaccine work short actually trying real world.  imagine pandemic could affect personally?

But Jan 23 shutdown Wuhan huge warning - meant even Chinese govt. freaking dangerous getting, willing take economic hit disrupt Chinese New Year celebrations. 

I understand US officials downplayed risks Dec - late Jan / Feb alarm bells going headlines really irritating.. one can't infected Covid-19. Covid-19 disease.

But best strategy would get national wastewater surveillance framework place use wastewater data drive pooled PCR rapid swab testing.  would massively reduce amount (and cost) individual testing. cells? Can't say I've loop. Want enlighten me? cares wedding Minnesota? Guess we'll wait. reality know safer seemed safer. also 24/7 worldwide news coverage. 80s last yrs really latch key kids. look back 40a 50s housewives many wanted mimic turns lots closet drinkers pill poppers. also think saw less safe ever before, especially social media. expert infectious diseases. medical writer works doctors every day reads medical literature part work. 

Numerous respected doctors scientists hold position virus. Many joined forces countries throughout world (off top head, Canada, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, India, Israel) state case, cases writing open letters respective governments. maintain eradication realistic humane strategy need learn live virus--namely, adopt common-sense mitigation measures letting life go on. 

I take strong issue idea skepticism lockdowns equates ""anti-science."" low-effort attempt shut rational dissent. Science, nature, rests skepticism questioning. scientist knows this.

A Wait minute.... Donald Trump LIED?!? Can’t be! Possible, highly unlikely  read that? come conclusion?

I’m fed discussion want get again. please go. don’t want part it. 1 5000 incidence TM well beyond reasonable threshold acceptable side effects""  least pre COVID19 times. easily see govt's opting vaccine basis 1 5,000 incidence TM beats 1 200 death rate. Things going get pretty desperate, particularly countries opted ""lockdown vaccine strategy"" apposed ""Swedish approach"". TIL nasal spray vaccines exist.  Santa: Ho-Ho-Ho, early make wish 2021, young man. 9/11 2,977 deaths

Covid-19 196,013

More 65 times many deaths (so far)

At current rate 2 9/11s US caused Covid week.

All POTUS says press conference Europe 50% deaths US (he actually did: ) reality 119 people died Europe 1200 died USA. 10x difference man talks 0.6x relationship ... Wondering. Brazil nearing herd immunity since they're finally seeing small decline cases deaths? Complete safety reality. does. absolutely unreasonable expectation.

Agree disagree then. think preventing millions dying stopping outbound air travel unreasonable. Maybe reason think needlessly killing millions acceptable. far responsibility, whole issue us taking responsibility wanting pass buck.

No, screwed pooch fucked greatly. said, mean China also fuck greatly too. get claim absolution China US also fucked up. like blaming tribe Africa HIV saying there's nothing do.

Except like that, ok. found 15 people 650,000 screened

LOL NZ found 17 people single plane India day. always get antibody test. 2 days standard clinical course illness. Also, beware sell unproven theory T-cells. interesting understand abstract studies silica generally agree Vitamin studies vivo, I’m always bit leery taking silica results strongly.

this result make pessimistic ongoing trials turn out. I’m familiar enough MR, don’t know useful proxy actually makes. spread, though? I'm genuinely asking seems like info actual spread sparse. Obviously we're painting broad strokes. familiar industry. I'm PI lawyer handled fair share nursing home abuse cases.

I know experience, promise many many many facilities (standalone facilities rural areas) nearly exclusively medicare/medicaid residents facilities live lives shoestring budget; one getting rich. I've seen books. 

They pay LPNs based Medicare medicaid pays pittance. 

I agree people work ought compensated more, fundamental laws supply demand part discussion.

I know answer is. Guess applied diseases.  choices now. Czechia mobilized sewing machines, one two patterns. many more, plenty choices stores too. people unhappy March/April/May mask upgrade now. quickly end pandemic would need available volume 100s millions *per day*, +/1 order magnitude. yet still remember lot new outlets smugly saying ""No, COVID 2019, despite sick were""

&amp;#x200B;

And suddenly ""Turns while"" stories popping everywhere. Masks... Don’t get us started... 

So admit anti-science anti-masker? lawmakers around world want charge people attempted murder wearing mask. getting mom tested drive? one person could driven live together, covid (got result today), obviously can't let go drive her. better just...not get tested yet? I'm different state them.

feedback instead downvotes please. wtf. I'm kinda freaking want guidance, fuck. People asked. everyone gives line symptoms staying home then.  quite problem us. dry cough feel like came upper part throat? chest?

Today started weird ticklish feeling tonsil area caused light dry cough. 

The reason I’m concerned friend day cornoavirus 2 months ago. *should* clear I’ve heard reports reinfection, I’m bit concerned since I’m diabetic.

I wore mask time, got drunk Labor Day hung together hours without one. paying fuckload tests battling covid? nose longs this! sane thought every day. extremely mild case mild symptoms. even cough. Yet fatigue exhaustion lasted month afterwards. can't imagine recovering moderate severe case. know lot that. myelitis serious condition involving inflammation spinal cord cause muscle weakness, paralysis, pain bladder problems. rare instances, vaccines triggered cases transverse myelitis; although also caused viral infections. 70% Belgians favor getting coronavirus vaccine feels like nobody learns anything. Reprieve? Let's repeat. WTF going comments here? Didn’t post archive link?

Here Damn miss Jays games. Leaf games. Concerts. ..... cmon vaccine. Let’s get things back normal 2021 second thought, probably stick gym. Lol trump recorded audio shows 5% death rate.

Ive saying it. Shocked face: 😱 Neat! expecting hurt like vaccine nothing all. It’s almost week haven’t adverse effects yet. don’t get second dose end month though. Good luck yours! story doesn’t specify makes kind useless IMO, part numbers kids I’ve seen lump everyone infants teens together. Also many symptoms take long time recover too. 1/15000 adverse reaction would pass safety standards. Granted know caused it.  outside wearing masks stationary. Maybe look little future see benefit. doubt capable. Btw. comment sounds like both: child moron. try r/wallstreetbets need people like there... Kids grabbinh candy bucket risky behavior Black Death killed less people higher percentage population. are? But, again, I’m sure someone plays toys takes pictures realizes that. Like wow. Miami River Valley, flows Ohio, Ohio River Miami Valley. Growing Dayton, news always referred surrounding area Miami Valley, 75 miles Ohio River. ""Downward trend"" mmhmm testing sliced half. True, can't rely common sense. live Rio, people completely disregarding science, calling whole thing hoax. Try speak it, jump you. That's common sense ya. worst part try explain know what's going happen, we've seen happen countries already. Nope, hoax. think good enough treatment disease yet justify taking road. Medicinal chemist Derek Lowe good [discussion similar context challenge really effective treatments coronavirus, understand effects humans less sure long-term effects. clearly people much less severe people far severe acute courses disease, goes long-term sequelae. [...] could really identify cohort prospective patients could say “Yeah, folks OK – you’re going get sick, something treat do”, would one thing. don’t.

(He's talking risks deliberately exposing low-risk volunteers disease, think concern treatment similar giving high-risk volunteers untested vaccine similar.) prorated based income ? im wearing anyways. bother all, handle it. USA number one bitches He'd lock us put place mask mandate. I’m waiting vaccine also approved EU. I’m anti-vaxxer means, piece cloth face become political football CDC capitulate public health guidelines order receive COVID data rerouted non-standard sources think foolish assume potential shenanigans higher levels FDA couldn’t happen well. illegal teachers Michigan strike, though union told go ahead need year.

Six figures nowhere near average. dude... makes sad people actually mean. internet really shows dark side people Perhaps shoot virus gdp fell 33 percent annualized assuming 2nd quarter numbers continued yeah brutal 2q 3q going worse Well dunno agree approach since topic. kindly admonish Japan fact made near impossible foreign residents return country since April 3rd? already known least three four months? news? fucking say that. Jesus Christ. new disinformation narrative something like 94%ers? Contact tracing studies obviously less likely uncover infections. main point:

As clinical data emerge, understanding presymptomatic post-symptomatic transmission improve critical future public health initiatives aimed controlling COVID-19 pandemic.

It's lower 40% model estimate. 11%. That's point. misconstruing presenting something not. misrepresentative garbage needs stop. sit back, big mac, beer watch world series Americans bored Canadians play in. can't imagine normal/intelligent person trapped days. hope gets better. wear gaiters anyway, worse wearing nothing all.. 7-day average deaths also less half April number new cases. take pandemic seriously never start. 450k went Sturgis, Smashmouth endorsed drew people show. know main draw people, association that's issue. sole cause 260 000 new infections, contributed.

I endorse Travis's behaviour, situation bad much smaller gathering interesting enough report on. No-one suggesting promoting unhealthy food good thing. AstraZeneca Oxford Vaccine.

The article says China's leading Covid Vaccine(CanSino) safe wake news AstraZeneca(Oxford)'s Vaccine pausing test reaction. poor mans gold ... orange arrow excellence. convenience, flaw structure society.

This probably important takeaway need get whole calamity. Right. known. Maybe did, power trip. this. History books, hope, talk this. absolutely heartless. genuinely wonder move increase decrease number international passengers visiting US.

As Canadian loves visiting small vacations visit friends family, leaning going anytime soon sure shit going now. adults need *grow fucking brain* realize election nothing vaccine development.

What, approve one Election Day we’ll say “nO oNe” shelve it? Americans never right thing. Winston Churchill wrong lot things, included. students wear mask gr4 up. mask breaks seats, masks on, halls masks on. 

I disagree rest littles absolutely masking too. I'd like know specific criteria needs met, removal mask mandate.

Because right now, would seem like standards either unknown, arbitrary.. Could resume, could also end permanently. review period short, that’s they’re telling us, hinting probable outcome review. 1/10000 adverse reaction actually concerning, that's enough possibly fail safety standards. details yet course, people definitely underestimating easy vaccine fail safety. course good chance caused vaccine, data comes see even rare occurance 1/10000.

And stop trial review data. cannot keep giving vaccine questions safety. C'mon now. line thinking land us unsafe ineffective vaccine. could bad erode people's trust vaccinations more. Agreed! Seriously mods sub actively covering repubs banning political talk. Awkward door screening, maybe encourage people stay home Yeah article you’ve read regarding COVID? problem #2 though see short path woods gets class next year.

Even we're lucky enough get vaccine January 1st, miracle they've got 300,000,000 doses ready go US, going take months get 1/3rd country actually accepts get it.

So maybe next school year 15%-20% adults vaccinated... we're extremely lucky.

Nothing see here...do need even add /s Headline technically true supplemented ""... hundreds times less deadly elderly people.""

Also, 2.7% hospitalized patients 18 34 died, article doesnt mention hospitalization rate, seems pretty damn important. got me. supposed leaders free world, crushed actual third world countries done better. don’t know beyond moron Ohio done well throughout pandemic.

Shoutout UH, Cleveland Clinic, OSU wenxer among many others amazing  So, won’t test American coming covid hotspot,

But still can’t get visa virtually covid free country like China I’m saying think could’ve stayed alone child to, would leave children alone illegal don’t children. weren’t laws think could’ve pulled off. Dr. Zhang Jixian she. don’t get it, chips get implanted? Listen man despite Trump fucking moronic stance. live South Carolina. elementary middle schools leap day week kids teachers week August 17th. likely there. means what, exactly? social distancing? Even treatable TM cause GB syndrome disable anywhere short period time years extreme cases. know couple people GB syndrome, one still disabled months later (had Feb). can't work took months even able walk normally again. still gets fatigued easily walking/standing long. lost lot strength arms well. even TM normally lasts weeks, lead serious complications long term.

If adverse reaction actually caused vaccine 1 first 15k could serious problem. 1/15000 adverse reaction enough would pass safety standards. 

Granted know vaccine caused this, chances really 1/15000, say article good news. mixed news, plan continue, still sure vaccine responsible. would problem, possibly huge one. flew Newark Europe August tested all. filled piece paper asked cough fever said no. end screening. personally got tested flew, required to. Land Covid, home stupid! understand conclusion differs strategy depends vaccine. isolate elderly sick A) vaccine B) develop herd immunity way vaccine.

If vaccine developed, citizens living country following either strategy allowed visit elderly. May God protect people potentially safe vaccine administered thorough safety tests? 45% deaths long term care facilities. 

And population represents small sliver U.S. population. diminish deaths, shows skewed covid mortality curve toward elderly people. Funny literally 0 report doctor (Zhong Nanshan) received nations highest honor. name literally household name China, no, people 'angry'. USA number 1  Even find one person million, worth it? one person pass knows many can't account many deaths might cause. Nothing like complacent pandemic one worst countries world hit it. It’ll thing happened June. soft lockdowns mandatory masks states bringing numbers around Memorial Day people got false sense security went numbers started climbing June. 

With schools reopening lot people acting like virus almost beat going cause another surge cases. point it’s predictable. mean adults age groups? outcomes got worse cohorts got older. source. racist joke? possibly, hear out, people tired lame jokes smooth-brained right-wing dipshits? mom come around 10 years ago- suddenly issues breathing weakness blue. ended ventilator breathing 4 months, going transferred long term care one point since didn’t see future it.

If woman teaching *remotely* caught coronavirus, it’s probably likely wasn’t following rules herself...chatting colleagues likely catching friends family empty classroom. sub tends blame people catching it, blame one? 

I downplaying nothing clarifying facts case. kids start spreading (and actually causing sickness, mythical “cases”), suppose we’ll know weeks. doesn’t happen, I’m sure we’ll find something new panic over. It’s common nomenclature made clear college This. trump eroding trust federal agencies like FDA CDC. I'll research trials approvals trusting vaccine administration, hurts say.

He dismiss it. says ""he problem that"", ""you want"" also clear says people US going around masks, says ""right now"" - admit he's disingenuous pedantic statements says ""right now"" knows there's shortage (he even says ""that's point"" end clip, basically acknowledging that's he's saying people wearing masks) also knows point (AKA ""right now"") cases Covid US. technically mean we've reached technological tipping point Buckminster always dreamt of, able provide 💯 mesa 💯 humanity. firmly believe could do, it. university work put hiring freeze place stalled merit-based raises promotions. due raise possible title change covid hit, position pay started year half ago.

That's exactly experts recommend. There's magic threshold zero positive tests significant period time wherein know we're dealing near zero risk increase positive tests.

Also, mention contact tracing United States reason making changes new cases near 1% positive places like NY NJ quite rich...

How get damned incompetent?!?

Once upon time, would never come light. People cared fraudulent fabrications wouldn’t missed obvious statistical improbabilities.

And failed, interior spies propaganda ministers would ahead information, mopping suppressing story.

Our societies become lazy incompetent.

I’d say “watch falling scientists”, incompetent morons probably get stuck wondering won’t fall, realizing forgot open damned window. one single weak spot - terrible managing stress, guess 2020 year really address Replying edits. “they” covering deaths school district? possibly continue work murderous surreptitious institution? 110,000 died waiting benefits 2015-2018. What's COVID? Yeah it’s nuts wouldn’t work everyone obviously, I’m sure would’ve missed parents thought came quality life think could’ve stayed alive left alone days absolutely necessary.

So yeah there’s easy answer. We’ve thrown hands given counting vaccines. think means, gaslighting talking ones ass? so-called ruled out-of-ass talkers? feels like lifetime ago. Man.

Is funny way say 200,000 deaths far end sight 28, 34, 42, 53, 62, 73

Those ages 6 teachers died article referred to.  expect lockdown forever?

It's point passed now. Time reopen, go back work. That's fucking insane cruel. Every paragraph article talking teachers catching virus places school. I'm sure deaths related school point article even is. need actual studies show teachers catching virus dying higher rates general population. turns case, assume school reopening might problems. stranger tricks opening door smashes window...I get saying, it’s living world don’t unless super super safe area. Even then, I’m sure parent would ever consider leaving 5-year old alone. It’s genuinely fucking nuts. dont see problem though. 1 school year. Thats fine. long takes. started march, would over. mostly over. started see around. don’t understand would want visit either unless to.  flu disappear therefore covid won't

So normally claim say something quote showing did, emulating favorite reality TV star? South Carolina leap day week week August 17th across entire state students (they could opt ) teachers (I'm sure optional). may this. Virtual students participated well. can't get people choose help neighbor die.

I agree everything said need do, see 75% neighbors fighting it, billions dollars lobbying money fighting it.

Would support somebody aiming goals, sure, unless corruption fairy idiot fairy join forces end self defeating voters convince every politician country give easy money going happen like that.


We got trickle economics people supposedly trickling ones paying people divert water. passing interactions would likely enough transmit enough virus severe reaction (contact tracers care 15+ face face interactions). 

Assuming didn’t start parent teacher conferences, I’d look elsewhere source infection. Keep mind SC, lower compliance masks distancing, etc. 

If tracer, I’d calling friends family, students. correct assuming number low lower infectious rates asymptomatic carriers? world half people aren’t taking seriously enough, hate downplay like that. treating assumption around anyone without mask significant amount time get it. that’s treat it. it’s actually still decent chance won’t get it. Seriously??? Wtf!!!!!

We doomed.

But, TF would want visit USA atm anyway? Sweden? ""slacking off""? fuck that's me, I've store everyone mask down, relaxed completely distancing even little. also hurry cause somewhere else got angry wound know blood pressure shoots circumstances like craazy. happens often me, definitely starting really something right moment. always knew bad, doctor tells take easy, wanted take mild herbal antianxiety go psychologist go decided fix myself. actually fixed fear-based anxiety cause there's enough comprehensive treatment available online anger-based ones I'm rush. damn. TSA TSA things... people say can’t SWEDEN health care think Sweden plague control agree. never really understood complaints. bullshit govt continually nobody bats eye, hill people ready die on. Ok, slight problem: never planning waiting complete phase 3. takes 2 years. Approval working vaccine guaranteed come that. political decision- part phase 3 also looking immunity wanes. makes long trials, know there's working vaccine that.

What we're actually looking efficacy signal. come certain number people get sick trial. actually likely happen relatively soon. believe Trump says vaccine clear understand anything behind trials would definitely understand science.

I believe Fauci getting optimistic. I'm also listening signals Pfizer setting out. end, data released approval. want public see make decisions take take still addressing false equivalence manufactured support whatever agenda is. would heartbeat borders open. Americans realize amazing country is, pandemic not. Cue Ryan Reynolds gif: “But why?” Genius I’m moving abroad soon lmao 

Free media doesnt brainwash people? theorem taught media?

I saw people held anti mask protests, people considering pandemic hoax, people regard inconvience losing freedom willingly disregard others' lives.

Considering polarized population US, safe bet either camp consider opposing side brainwashed subscribed medias.

It seems Free media offer multiple paths lead brainwashed braindead.  country size entire continent awful comparison... I'm going concert Saturday flying week that.

They still exist. source cooking? long, temp exactly?  

I remember reading article ago covid heat resistant took one researcher 15 minutes 197 degrees kill it. much hotter longer food cooked. example fish often cooked 145 -165 degrees. Sure. Let’s talk France vs US. use worldometer, it’ll great!

To make apples apples comparisons, let’s sure per capita comparisons. Sounds fair right?

Let’s see...

Tot Cases/1M Pop:
France: 5,269
US: 19,764

Seems US worse there.

Deaths/1M Pop:
France: 472
US: 589

Hmm. Seems US worse too.

I understand you’re talking direction graphs. slope faster upward trajectory ours, could still implement policy change, we’ve refused implement, turn back around remain comparative stats.

Further, spike cases may failing implement policies make sense resulted running rampant country spilling theirs.

There *no doubt* lockdown policy helps prevent spread disease. states proved works even here. problem we’re uniformly, states still won’t real lockdown. one area gets really bad another area comes lockdown area infects other. exactly say country joke. can't hear sound property taxes getting higher. Making virtually income rental property can't increase rent rate taxes going awesome. fiancée American, hence interest things work there. said, idea deductible explaining me. honestly shocked hear told family ""tax day"" taxes. 

My whole life taxes, healthcare pension taken directly pay cheque never ""file"" anything. pay house car tax, set amount, every 12 months that's it. Even went university, government cover expenses, also paid health care, qualified ""student"" therefore exempt paying taxes. Bachelors Master’s degrees. 

We pay ""high"" taxes, according fiancée, arguably true. However, someone else's taxes paid education healthcare student. Now, turn pay someone else's similar fashion. circle continues. applied EIDL grant supposed $1000. Never heard thing application received. reached House Representative Senator, nothing.

He apply UE time system brought online, able reopen. woman died Covid-19 *before* school started. death tragic, unrelated school itself. state state rule. Honestly, local rule all, would mean people would actually say local community run, can't let happen. What's more, president leading USA literally **admitted** he's downplaying whole mess ... **proud** it. *WOW* Data dump. There's going choice though. chance Joe Schmoe access vaccine November Worse? I’d surprised. interesting see. Still bad. likely people returning work and, probably so, large increase testing per day. 27 countries European Union plus U.K., Norway, Iceland Liechtenstein recorded 27,233 new cases Wednesday, compared 26,015 U.S. 

Things bad mentioned 27 EU countries + UK, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein population 500 million. 

But generally though, going get worse. getting control Spring, light summer people slacking off. Another small small number bane pandemic response.

To personally, ""not small"" number. Literally goes somewhere see Smashmouth. Travis Scott obviously McDonald's Management's blessings. read comments people excited. problem pandemic people turning blind eye risk things people personally like. really bad look Travis McDonald's. audience largely 18. lot kids there. Celebs intentionally drawing crowds pandemic horrible imo. college kids news. Travis Scott, news. Why? sad. worried teachers infected numbers like health care workers 1st wave hit. teachers, however, less well protected less well trained protect students. even happens, he’s going continue speak.... thankfully. Let tell you, it’s exhausting. Luckily live liberal bubble LA, otherwise would moved abroad years ago... South Carolina leap day week week August 17th across entire state. Even virtual students. Students teachers met schools material pick ups testing. Oh, I’m going. think it’s fucking ridiculous. people elected king dipshit represent them. experienced global pandemic entire upbringing? suspect half hospitalized patients long haul recovery  Sure, point Fauci thankfully going going do. going speak.  difference administration actively using resource is, kind like football team sticks star player bench reason, like Raiders Marcus Allen. That’s sidelining.  Muzzling means Fauci wouldn’t allowed speak, clearly going continue regardless whether administration engages not. main difference administration isn’t actively using resource. mean, technically deserve ridicule. excellent idea address lot economic, social incarceration ills country.

&amp;#x200B;

Which exactly none ever happen like people fine groped strangers electromagnetic waves shot body give rando portrait naked body, draw line wearing mask.  useless theater nothing improve safety (like TSA).

So, par course then?  Masks seem work enough really curb things sadly. Makes sense ban sports it’s easier enforce mask mandate vaccine lands, people going get destroyed solid couple months. Why? ruled unrelated simple coincidence. Coincidences happen they're concerning want be. teacher never taught kids. School online. perhaps could avoided, classroom full kids. Exceptionally misleading headline. bee fair, think changed court ruled it. see we're still downplaying seriousness Good point perpetuity. Strange question mask mandate. mask mandate right unless we’ve moved back mitigation containment. regards clothing mandates, US generally moving towards lessening restrictions. Calves everywhere...take puritans! non-american, know FSU acronym Fuck Shit Up, feels equally appropriate illegal own. Switzerland far know, allowed ammo Apparently so. Europe created fascism communism. Tried failed both.

Recently you’ve disaster mass migration “refugees”.

On top EU could even keep Britain member.

It’s total shit show Europe.

Mocking US, catastrophe cases skyrocketing fucking funny point.

Go ahead, tell Europe superior shitty paychecks weak currency mask sight there, either indoors outdoors. thousands upon thousands people saw constitute large enough sample size peer-reviewed study.  travelled Europe last month needed see parts world people dealing virus balanced way. 

the two statements different one another like believe are. seek profound life altering experience, went restless bored jeopardised people's lives callously. abject act selfishness, which, ironically, completely contradicts human nature prevail madness.

human nature never prevail long prioritise immediate wellbeing long term wellbeing others. wonder people sat trenches shelled daily months end must think pitiful generations they've left behind. Bangalore I've seen people wearing mask chin covering mouth nose.. live country people keep helmets arm riding wear seeing cops ...we need heavy fines wearing mask ..now like 200₹ ZERO scientific basis Fauci others said. Read article. NUMEROUS instances others saying people didn’t need mask KNEW people wearing masks. many people died cause told don’t wear mask Fauci MONTHS don’t blame parents wanting kids childcare. blame government financially supporting parents. also blame government issuing federal mask mandate. leave local state governments, you’re gonna many governments bungling response incompetent. particular school virtual since opening school, important note person get virus due class students.

Also note, person morbidly obese. attest this. Happened wife shitty Deep South state. fire at-will claimed student always late another class hers. Principal called 12 days Christmas, fired spot. also took license/certification away well. tribunal lawyer appointed paid ex-teachers groups act behalf. froze $30k teacher's retirement fund let decide either keep would duration time til retirement (22 years), take penalty near 40% take early. chose keep whole retirement eligibility age would kick in. 

Teaching administrations, principals, school officials nothing bunch good, lying bastard, pieces total shit. could care less kids. long they're getting paid paid well government care less. Well I'm glad realized communicated poorly. Guess make mistakes. soon election passes, win lose, Trump going shit vaccines publicly. base interested riddled anti-vaxxers.  cast doubts necessity safety. Administration bungle delivery, blame states, withhold major cities.

If administration change US lucky 15 percent population vaccinated July 4th, 2021 teacher never taught kids, online. Shocking.  said ""fucking dumb"", would understating depth disability. mean getting blood work tested see diseases (like MS rare neural disease OP), without symptoms. way get referral GP without actually symptoms. London took 4 weeks get appointments clinic. country tests landed 

False. Several countries screen way test anyone arrives fever anyone self-reports saying symptoms. I'll take vaccine kind efficacy FDA approved. I'll honestly take every 6 months deaths? ten times many dead neighboring countries. 5800+ excess deaths 6504 week 13-33. It’s odd parents say protect children costs send school pandemic virtual learning feasible majority them.

Classes virtual school....

This teacher contact students morbidly obese.  Nope, intentionally lied to. Maybe you’re ok I’m not. created confusion around masks. should’ve done tell people cover faces using whatever can. Instead said don’t need cover face. That’s fucking insane here, parents use summer day camps. string together bunch affordable day camps summer long offered zoo, YMCA, recreational centers, art camps, sports camps, coding camps, etc kid ends pretty awesome summer. That's just... world much worse state America. mean daycare better school. economy demands young couples 2 incomes, there's simply answer pandemic regarding kids.

Fucked do, fucked don't. Chicago south whites ? mean you’ll never watch shrek ? read article rather headline - teacher didn’t get Covid teaching. never taught kids, district teach home. training school started, never taught kids.  schools audacity say""there's way enforce wearing masks."" turn around berate girl shirt happens cover entire shoulders.

While small number, German government took 3 trillion last year. 3.3

The US government took amount.
3.46 seasonal influenza, rhinoviruses ""less serious"" infections also cause chronic conditions...

Seasonal Influenza takes 100-200+ children even teachers year. estimates even higher since Influenza testing common.

I dismissing severity covid, want put perspective since people assume COVID-19 circulating virus cause longer lasting damage. Yay!!! Rice beans way healthier fast food... Refined starches unhealthy. Brown rice oatmeal fine. Look health outcomes Mexico past 30 years.

Additionally, studies show adding supermarkets food deserts little impact people eat. Frozen vegetables always choice. Fast food meals becoming increasingly expensive well cost argument becoming weak. America obesity issue across **all demographics.** Obesity actually goes income among black community. white women see obesity levels greatly decline income partially attributed depression rates increasing among obese white women. That's... said ah, matter even count them, right? wise move lemme tell why: no... Yup, come Swedish trolls trying defend country’s fuckup. Russian data appears unlikely patterns, duplicate data among different several data patterns appear repeatedly reported experiments,” open letter said. “On ground simple probabilistic evaluations fact observing many data points preserved among different experiments highly unlikely.”

However, published data include numbers participants, basic statistical tests (such Benfords Law) cannot applied, point.

The clear implication that, something amiss. want ban Chinese tourist RACIST Swedish strategy success, far it. hell guy weird people asking died he's got flag half mast? guarantee there's single country world anyone would think ""must people killed covid"" USA #1! Probably allowing locally owned nursing homes, plus better funding, plus mandatory nurse:patient ratios. job pays more, demand better work, mention workers low stress better ones financial boot neck, actually present residents. agree rural nursing homes it’s shame. state, live city hundreds miles every direction. many small town homes closed residents sent hours away families. read re-homed residents die average within 6 months, experience it’s true. work chain started standalone facility. run former CNA, considered standard area. took 30 years ago previous owner. 3 years ago, partnered larger chain, guess she’s getting ready retire selling it. staffing problems managerial bloat started -you guessed it!- 6 months later. work weekends don’t deal them. captain obvious journalism doesn’t really matter they’re “closed rest world” 

lol okay .7% consist bet nearly half passengers South Korea. Meanwhile look US... everyone party positive difference make? Yeah, extra 0.7% chance dying covid19, assuming get it. Crazy times, right? terrifying. Finally someone speaks fucking common sense.... Man one really won’t die it. Guess America love racism. people back: difference outdoor, almost entirely masked protest indoor, maskless activity. That’s it! It’s simple. Throw gun parties (or whatever) want long outdoors masks. literally went three MONTHS without cases, doesn’t really matter they’re “closed rest world” since international tourism isn’t big part gdp. russia, simply matter Putin approving  impact sudden increase death, especially impacts parts society service others like doctors, nurses, teachers requires significant time, effort, expertise reach serviceable position much severe. 

I think data backup increased risk contracting virus among teachers, especially adhering CDC guidelines.

 

I can't help wonder, greater average death rate, due covid, among teachers, would attributable factor prevalent demographic. high number anyway population nine million people, typical living edge leaving people responsible... many advantages situations, pandemic.

And statement factually incorrect. ""great victory"" breaking 2000 barrier 31st August. can't say I'm surprised, seen people behaving Tel Aviv throughout August problem. kids / youths making end summer holiday...

Not mention religious Jew Arab sectors making Tel Aviv look like New Zealand, definitely ""leaders"" story. fact, driving work morning, heard interview radio morning mayor Nazareth. ""What corona? red city(\*)? There's thing, business usual, come visit."" mean, chance people attitude?

The first day school 1st September, day 2000 barrier broken, ten days ago today.

(\*) Designation Health Ministry high-risk area, based data. Didn’t remember??? RACIST ban Chinese tourist! Anyone interested sending stimulus money?? really hoping would coming soon. 😫 I'm sure top head reporting done this. Either New York Times Statnews. US Customs Border Protection deferred comment Department Homeland Security, declined comment. administration official told CNN draft public affairs guidance memo lays rationale ending airport screening: 675,000 passengers screened 15 airports, fewer 15 identified Covid-19

Which administration official with? matter anyone else this? countries realized it, cat already bag.

If center new, non-contained epidemic, could choose, know, infect world, thus stopping migration epidemic pandemic. know taking responsibility things weird 2020, still least pretend try. Yeah true. likely landed U.S. fall. won’t. Oh, argument? Poor lil guy's gonna get proper echo chamber childhood strive provide! completely reasonable. 675,000 passengers screened last several months, 15 identified  seroprevalence results actually less consistent caught 80% deaths hospitalizable cases, catching 20% non-hospital-worthy cases. Sorry can't see dismissive masks ""we dont need walking around masks right now""

When absolutley been. even says universal waring masks essential now.

Sorry cant see flip flop lol. glad believe cover backpeddling.

If want proof hes bullshitter new guidelines officially announced airborne?

You still think 6 feet enough? recommendation goggles. recommendation stay air conditioned enclosed spaces, knew hold things outside even 1913 Spanish flu. mention avoiding downwind people? guidelines advice him? he's bullshitter tells people want hear. course he's aware things said, basic virology he's top virologist NIH, want ignorant people aware shit panic, things like oh dunno, buy masks example. lies. think gross initial findings show although low expression ACE2 younger children (&lt;10 years age) likely corresponds reduced infection rates, children ages, infected, carry high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Symptom monitoring ineffective strategy identifying infected children

I think going find anything uses exact term, facts are. Kids carry higher viral load average, show way fewer symptoms (making remediation much harder) kids, understand goddamned hard get listen basic ""don't spread germs"" stuff.

tl;dr, they're packed full snot, horrible hygiene show symptoms.  Exactly combo want stealth spread covid.

follow article Harvard: problem states basically can't afford that. federal government ability create money nowhere hand people. effectively ""financed"" first stimulus bill: made whole lot new dollars threw country. 

States allowed that. Every dollar state spends actually financed somehow either taxes selling bonds repaid interest. state already spending money earns, there's way suddenly come tens hundreds millions enact backdoor-UBI. Uh. I’m afraid dying. wife children depend financially emotionally.   Tell governor. Indeed. actually eliminate firewall around borders. complicated. *You kidding right.*

Uncertainty treatment efficacy relies mainly observational nature published studies far major risks bias confounders

*The key words Observational study told enough though*

Our study several limitations strengths. observational study data collected using standardised report forms critical phase epidemic Belgium.

The evaluation HCQ efficacy population therefore primary objective data collection itself. Also, actual HCQ dosage systematically checked True. reporter Atlantic could asked. doesn’t mention once. spouse physician last week tested double-digit college students sent home positive tests. 100% asymptomatic. I've teacher die Oklahoma, week ago. tragic loss, whole town went ahead like nothing keep going back school. idiotic thing ever. 200,000 deaths ok they're 'old' &amp; 3 mil die year causes? heart disease, cancer, school shootings etc contagious? 

It's ok man took oath protect Americans, blatantly lie highly contagious deadly virus/disease whose effects still completely known? ignore experts spent entire lives studying viruses say?

And people saddled major debt funerals month-long expensive stays hospital? 

Do care loved ones? 

One thing, replace word 'Trump' 'Obama' , would still ok? gym open I’m scared go lol. figure it’s got worst place don’t wanna get covid. 🤷‍♂️ Facebook worse COVID many cases. choose stop exposing Facebook. also keep hospitals inundated, thus keeping survival rates higher anyone else done this? Stopped outbound flights? even stop people going NYC hit hardest. Badass UK security thorough US, still perfectly adequate. guy moan me, trays bigger. queues shorter. TSA sucks. Yes. unwilling read information. got long short version. Read want information. 

You sworn refusing read 4 short sentences accepting things nuanced. know vaccines going successful point, we? could leverage amazing world wide logistics system build manufacturing facilities bring experts train locals every region world -- mothball facilities based technologies work. end, still regional delivery challenges. 

The reality going balance. Successful vaccines produced one location able avoid long haul flights. remember reports news US researchers refused access Chinese virus research labs. question why? story lost Democrat primary debates lies 45. may squelched 45 crew back then. Anything avoid confrontation Chinese.  trust machine intelligence human intelligence working TSA day week twice Sunday compare US travel experience Switzerland. work forgotten take multi-tool laptop bag check luggage. big multi tool, 4 "" blade. instinctively start apologizing get nervous pulling 4"" knife carry immediately say ""Oh geeze sorry forgot that, throw away guess"" security guy looked second, looked said ""Promise stab anyone damage plane it?"" said yes. put knife back bag waved through. Excited! It’s game day baby obvious state leaning one way vs major problems containing it. 

You can't ""freedom"" way this. [Get facts **760**
Sweden: **560**

but maybe soon come true wish hard enough. lol watched video, seems watched different one. first thing Faucci says (and I'll quote him)

Faucci: ""The masks important."" 

Faucci: ""It's providing perfect protection people think is""

Faucci: ""when think mask think healthcare providers needing people ill.""

Faucci: paraphrased : ""when look foreign places 85% people wearing masks that's fine, I'm it.""

IV: ""but lead shortage masks?""
Faucci: ""Exactly, could lead shortage masks people really need doctor says dont need mask airborne virus, pandemic, idea virus capable hack liar. guess support that.

Please listen think saying. 

1) Masks important. 2) Masks important healthcare workers. 3) He's wearing masks 4) selfish stupid members public hoard masks may create shortage medical professionals risking lives caring covid patients.

So answer statement guessed right, support ensuring healthcare workers (who far higher risk I) access PPE. 

None dishonest. Tell whatever want make feel better taking masks could saved lives hospital workers. makes stupid well selfish. Sucks guess.  Exponential growth. clinical trial ongoing similar molecule. apartment share centralized HVAC units? could vector. need cuss out, I’m asking simple question Every year bunch people get sicker ever flu, heavy flu season. fraction severe illnesses covid low late February United States. Ive read articles stated earliest case recognized china November possibly October. Needless say, spy apparatuses available, even mention december would made Intel come forward information. think may A) B) try prevent getting virus C) helps dealing better exposed got it.  
There recent Reddit post gave good evidence support C) well - H1N1 2009 may new strain scientist still better understating flu.

Not covid. around since least 1965.

Coronavirus might existed past obviously mutated. one immunity it, thats spread became pandemic. thing flu. new strain ability become pandemic. immunity unless similar previous strains got sick with.

Or, put another way, 24 counties red zone 26 counties yellow zone.***

Things going well home state, say least. I'm showing thread 7 upvotes. doubt seen many people. certainly see it.

I wonder many times video post deleted subreddit. Hey everyone thinks football important, feel? n=8 control groups. Meaningless. Someone please correct me, think part concern around immunity still spread infect others effectively immune? argument TSA checkpoints primarily catch, deter. potential attacker knows likely get caught, probably even try. would mean number real attackers caught necessarily best metric.

Note, argument bit useless TSA woefully bad catching test attackers trials, doubtful deters real attackers information.

Compare temperature screening... really trying catch intentionally sneaky people, deterring likely much factor. Cases caught screening good metric gauge effectiveness. effective all. theatre show sucks! joke lmao keep general population. isolate outbreaks, isolate virus.  So, true believer. kinda hoping one smart ones gets paid.

## Abstract

### Objective

The vitamin endocrine system may variety actions cells tissues involved COVID-19 progression especially decreasing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Calcifediol rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. therefore evaluated effect calcifediol treatment, Intensive Care Unit Admission Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized COVID-19.

### Design

parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial.

### Setting

university hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain.)

### Participants

76 consecutive patients hospitalized COVID-19 infection, clinical picture acute respiratory infection, confirmed radiographic pattern viral pneumonia positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission case total score 1).

### Procedures

All hospitalized patients received best available therapy standard care, (per hospital protocol), combination hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours first day, 200 mg every 12 hours following 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally 5 days. Eligible patients allocated 2 calcifediol:1 calcifediol ratio electronic randomization day admission take oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), not. Patients calcifediol treatment group continued oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) day 3 7, weekly discharge ICU admission. Outcomes effectiveness included rate ICU admission deaths.

### Results

Of 50 patients treated calcifediol, one required admission ICU (2%), 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%) p value X2 Fischer test p &lt; 0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio ICU patients Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio ICU patients Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting Hypertension T2DM): 0.03 (95%CI: 0.003-0.25). patients treated calcifediol, none died, discharged, without complications. 13 patients treated calcifediol, admitted ICU, discharged. 13 patients admitted ICU, two died remaining 11 discharged.

### Conclusion

Our pilot study demonstrated administration high dose Calcifediol 25-hydroxyvitamin D, main metabolite vitamin endocrine system, significantly reduced need ICU treatment patients requiring hospitalization due proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems able reduce severity disease, larger trials groups properly matched required show definitive answer. lived ... two years moving Yunnan. saw changes. 2010 12 ... could find birth rate minority grouping. population. Case counts irrelevant . many show dangerous symptoms die. get behave like influenza fine. gym found I'm EMT giving free membership till pandemic cools down.

Still hazard pay, least get free workouts every day. UBI majority support thanks him. politicians across-the-board opening idea. hope someday soon see put action. gone doctor test done determine cold? maybe could allergies? know allergy symptoms similar colds: sore throat, clogged nose, phlegm cough. usually time every year get allergic reaction like miss work one week. i'm hoping wear mask 100% outside could reason allergies flare yet. Nah, still test.  None hopelessly enslaved falsely believe free got 15 Covid killers handful terror killers. Useless covid, useless terror? check passport could checked automatically airline. passport, fly? surprise point.

Didn't also find virus canals Europe Spring 2019 something? I’ve heard Canada like 20-30 percent new cases due travel. Iirc every traveler tested. screened. Tested. fines people don’t isolate two weeks travel. idea airport would even screening crazy. America taking seriously. always amazes people think conspiracy exists seeming mismatch two **publicly available** numbers. CDC goes, ""why deliberately underreport deaths category purposes, even though idiot internet connection get right numbers 30 seconds."" Yeah, OK.

I think BIT likely two numbers measuring different things. Jus want watch world burn No, they’ll go bars (mostly) putting effort keep things **sanitized** safe

If talking sanitizing things, looking right things. Sanitizing almost irrelevant. want talk ""virtue signaling,"" wiping tables sanitizing. Surface contact major vector.


Last call 10 great. later gets, drunker people get. means talk louder, ignore distancing, even giving reason go home several hours earlier reduces likelihood spread.

House parties happen regardless last call timing cause different avenues spread. House parties largely friend groups, whereas bar cause spread across different groupings. Bars far dangerous public health standpoint 1 infected guy infect multi groupd across multiple days. House parties? Less people attending likely see times well. well trained. Good boy. fake news get teachers. They're walmart employees easily replaced split second, easily walk out, strike, make demands they're easily replaceable still necessary component society can't get rid altogether. Schengen - US citizen/Schengen resident allowed fly two think Romans wore sandals?  State limit 50 believe looks 50, estimation don’t always option teachers cause panic? Bingo Plenty states started school August They’re referring fact open school soon teachers getting sick they’re even school system yet. missed point obviously. Vote fucks guy balls tell china shit contagious. gave world extra two months prepare. squandered. [I'm really fussed that. I'd rather support wee town teams players born local area watch overpriced overrated crap pipe TV Wow hope begin with?  point. 2 week incubation period, 2 weeks ago nobody school. august. So...not smart. Good lord. mean, expect republican government 🤣🤣🤣 That's primarily either less populated less visited anyways we've strayed far main point discussion, need continue anymore. nice day pal, stay safe:) response exactly pandemic issue. people playing sports ones affected. COVID doesn’t infect host stop there, spreads everyone else person contact with, including parents teachers. That’s it’s fucked Sturgis allowed happen, event spread corona country people involvement event.

Honestly going thread, people making arguments pass common sense checks? motivation letting virus run rampant? quarantine not? great explanation COVID testing. article definitely worth read. Thanks posting. country Europe? Schengen area, UK Ireland banned US. number statistically zero intents purposes, yeah, counted. fact kids school teachers, parents, grandparents gonna die kids online classed. admit yes I’m okay people dying you’re pro school teaching. 

This exact statement could made given year without coronavirus.

It's nothing phenomenon. Teachers students die every year communicable diseases. accept certain amount risk every day normal times order live lives. would argue live northeast cases low right person instruction would very, low risk. However, places like Florida probably back school risk much higher. say commenter OK people dying asinine since want people die cease human public activity. think OK people drive car? do, OK people die car accidents every year. Everything life balance risk reward. ...says person used word ‘retarded’ like 5th grader prevents people trying. someone high enough fever stand crowd could probably visually tell well. can’t lessons conducted primarily online masks mandated? see Pelosi, Cuomo De blasio list miss those. Maybe mentioned really fine print BWAHAHA, deep blue New Jersey they’re pushing us go fully back November. amazing things small sample sizes, take number billion. asshole. still need quarantine air travel US.

If skirt rules federal government allows it, guess what, laws state local levels. Even India taken virus seriously. Also 1.3 billion people India like 5 million cases isn’t bad size country Funny students people There's certain subset Americans completely lack sort empathy, anything unless directly benefits themselves. They'll say US adopted Sweden method works well really mean would least impact day day lives. say single work US really mean good insurance want tax dollars go people. fucking ridiculous. One mom town complained local community group that. immediately shut dozens people saying ""it's *first day*! first day ever heavy work?"" US done plenty bad shit US stands freedom speech, press, religion CCP decidedly way.

The soft power war influence developing regions US China huge deal. Australia- state We're stage 4 lockdown, can't travel outside 5km radius home, home 8pm. New cases trending downwards 700 deaths. Inbound international flights diverted states. Citizens return overseas required 14 day forced quarantine. State borders closed states Nobody would cover purpose ""smugglling \[covid\] in"" - they'd purpose able work earn money.

That's assuming even deliberate - people take medicine feel bad order feel better, masking happens consequence. Plenty parents send sick kids school/day care. Even “blue ribbon” school kids went send regular reminders dose kid Tylenol Advil send school. lives worth saving children future?

If makes sense lock world life save people. extra deaths acceptable. good life homes.

Influenza declared pandemic well. never know bad effects could be, always err side safety. Freedom much less important. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Depends red purple Skittles nasty green yellow ones? honestly make sense me. country says leisure activities open till vaccine. shit need support country stays open, stuff tough watch tv shit love witty amusing comments like bro

Sorry, making someone much money get rid of. Imagine teacher replaces her. get hazard pay. could pour bleach solid block coronavirus would kill all. despite certain people said, obviously cannot inject veins would kill too. something works vitro doesn’t mean work people. Exactly.

As “armchair epidemiologist” used faith CDC. botched beyond belief rollout testing, lost faith.

But still faith FDA. summer.

Now, I’m Dr. Fauci. recommends take vaccine, will. US big one wave time.

Right first wave Iowa part midwest.

If/when hits Seattle start 2nd wave US. one skeptical change? Seems like good way get people medicated rather actually solve researchers reanalyzed data using **new guidelines 130/80 mm Hg**, found 19 percent Americans hypertension blood pressure control. virus calling inside house! Turns children adult transmission rare. Adult adult non issue ask me. think got lost way wherever slime migrated donald disappeared. Question whether Dr Li deserved Order Republic topic still heavily debated among Chinese netizen well.

First clarification, award handed Dr Zhong Nanshan (The Chinese Fauci) ""citizen award"". 共和国勋章 **THE highest recognition** awarded Chinese citizen. look awarded past, recipients either nuclear scientists made great contribution ""Two Bomb, One Satellite"" program Nobel Prize winner like Tu YouYou Zhong Nanshan received award days ago well deserved, without doubt unprecedented efforts uncovering eradicating COVID-19 within Wuhan Hubei province. 

Dr Li already given awards given Wuhan doctors participated front line named martyr ""烈士” along many passed away fighting covid. hope people impression Dr Li received ZERO recognition.

Now two sides argument seen far:

On one hand, represent ""the average joe"" China. person realizes something wrong courage act it. people sympathizes Dr Li anti CCP bureaucracy (which caused whole mass early Jan) believe CCP owe Dr Li award, sort.

On hand, Dr Li actual ""contribution"" combating covid greater tens thousands medical personals risked lives Wuhan hundreds lost life. feel fair Li awarded average doctors/nurses lost lives againist COVID.

So, comes debate whether medal awarded based rhetoric actual contribution. Ah okay, missed that. You’re assuming high school students aren’t living home older people, college kids don’t ever see relatives older teachers Incorrect. Taylor law deemed violation human rights Supreme Court. yeah, ~80k week that. depressing people act like children way, feel need escalate make threats getting violent. People US live democracy ideas processes voted on. someone asking vote something mean pass. leads **should** best interests health mind voting.

It would good every time someone threatens someone's well get heavily fined. Hurt life style, need go jail live tax payers. action cause mental harm, also time causes physical harm. People need learn civil. Violence saved defense violent attack. scare people submission trying help community. Source? surpress disease ways? isolating. stop isolating, cases rise like Norway. virus go away isolating, putting hold.

Also think falsely drawing causation correlation here. Many safety measures introduced care homes, masks part it. Two things wrong statement least. First, effects covid terms cardiac lung issues well understood yet happen frequency concerning, certainly older children younger adults. may know full repercussions years ultimately need deal that.  Second, know younger people fully capable spreading virus vulnerable populations.  Nobody saying lock life, aren’t going back issues better understood threat reduced via vaccine virus becomes less issue either population immunity picking virus become less virulent. That’s way going be.  point arguing otherwise. That's popular opinion. Honest work equal honest pay, though.  vast majority hypertension cases controlled diet exercise. fact is, doctors give useless sometime poor advice comes diet. Good article. liked pointed closed beaches giving minimum wage workers sick leave widely ignored. practices locker rooms everyone chats other? Outdoor weddings super spreader events CanSino one. Sinopharm one. Cansino's vaccine safe level neturalising antibody low. Sinopharm's much promising. every case. Coronavirus rampant immigrant communities, live multi- generational families seldom work home. one contacts undocumented, want official record living there.

I personally doubt public health officials cooperating ICE, things would look different perspective immigrants.

Also, article points Florida's testing bogged essentially useless, locals know this. got call exposed, would able take time work leave house test results came back. people simply cannot afford take work. Best case scenario situation contact gets call, stands line test, goes work, keeps going work several days test result comes back. Oh god true? I’ve got like month work November could 10 day road trip around Utah

Wow real I’m going 70 time, IIRC, get time-based entry ticket advance order admitted. number well normal they're serious masks. 

MA pretty well, considering. There's pockets towns less well (5.0% positivity rate, places like Everett) state focusing resources areas, too, overall taking seriously. agree general point sides aren’t always equal. said:

Questioning blanket restrictions pandemic strategy hardly anti-science. Hundreds doctors scientists questioning it. Many banded together written group letters governments arguing balanced strategy. Canada, New Zealand, Belgium, Germany, India Israel come mind. basis scientific inquiry skeptical, questioning mindset. scientific rationale draconian measures used manage Covid hardly established, harms lockdown blanket restrictions real.

To me, cure worse disease democracies. Whether agree disagree depends science balance values safety, freedom, tolerance risk. Phase 3 (not 2) trials designed last 2 years, except maybe Astra Zeneca think shorter. Everyone hoping results available sooner, public health reasons political reasons seems. Oxford. would literally ask fuck done Russians Chinese. take surprising amount, people shit various obscure crap time. There're plenty cases public sentiment sway government decision due people blabbering internet. called outrage even register social media recommend check r/GermanHumor

... hilarious ;)

## Nope. one could predicted this, could seen coming? /s like street name! Gonna use that. sad dangerous young teachers well older ones. tell that. We've got enough idiots fighting attempts containment. Great point, should’ve clarified better. could see vaccine getting approved end year, however, getting approved ready mass distribution two different things. Q2 2021 prediction we’d honestly kinda need something approved end year, likely could (should?) case exactly happen? 

The old cherry picked Facebook post stated ""No reason walking around mask"", left rest statements masks arent perfect protection, help keep infected people infecting others?

Because that's actually happened. guarantee ever vaccine. Swedish strategy always introduce long-term viable restrictions recommendations, keep spread virus manageable levels overwhelm health care system. vaccine arrives speed returning normal everyday life, that's great. can't rely happening, though. trust numbers? Got nice bridge sell you. downvotes this, really. I'm American perspective certainly see appeal. America's got problems nobody getting bombed. State New York, 33K dead (Democratic governor), State Florida, 12K dead (Republican governor). 

FYI. It’s worth thing ever fly least times year GBS? “They” everyone charge school district work in, school board, superintendent, principals, etc. I’m Texas districts haven’t required report cases schools week. know deaths people know work campuses they’ve happened. entire point, stories think exaggerated/misleading tip iceberg spread that’s actually already happening. course teachers likely catching virus letting guard down, continue even students there. exponential growth, every case large, indoor gatherings. think “mythical cases” kids won’t play part spread??? already know that’s true. 

And, I’m currently taking medical leave resign, that’s working awful place (most districts area behaving way, way). coworkers, unfortunately, option. Please kind, teachers horrific mess right tired people downplaying deaths call “mythical cases”. think understand exponential growth means. COVID exponential growth, would eventually end infecting one trillion humans...even though 7.8 billion humans alive. Man, back quarantine started weeks felt tired confused. wondering mental reaction isolation, even though different normal life. Also past ten years I've take like 2 weeks total sick time. super rare get sick do, always super mild. I'm primary candidate asymptomatic. 

I'll still live life assuming caught everything catch it. antibody tests easy get free, really want see already went it. Dr Zhong article removed. Dr Zhong article way on-topic Dr Fauci article. point I'm trying make mod extremely US-centric. article top infectious disease expert manages COVID-19 response nation 1.3 billion deemed relevant. reads like press release. playing numbers, effectiveness filtering inhale important exhale. Looks like Trump COVID-19 decades. guess still fine shooting Home Alone. disagree you. masks actually go facial recognition tech definitely think govt get rid eventually. look [district yourself.

There multiple articles her. Many detailed. feel sorry you. won’t. 

## Abstract

As past pandemics, co-circulating pathogens may play role epidemiology coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). hypothesized influenza interacted SARS-CoV-2 early 2020 epidemic COVID-19 Europe. developed population-based model SARS-CoV-2 transmission, combined mortality incidence data four European countries, test range assumptions impact influenza. found consistent evidence 2-2.5-fold population-level increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated influenza period co-circulation. results suggest need increase vaccination influenza, reduce burden due influenza viruses, also counteract facilitatory impact SARS-CoV-2. think change possible. Andrew Yang went ""who?"" actually recognized Democratic world less 6 months. Post-pandemic, LOT people starting listen ideas supporting. That's say lot people simply scream ""COMMUNISM...I MEAN SOCIALISM...I MEAN...WHATEVER IS!"" hits national stage, momentum. keep pushing. say former almost full-time Republican voter simply started looking results deciding much pushing simply bear look data historical results. One projection says 400,000 end year. Personally “feels” high me, seeing pictures college high school campuses fills dread. study size 3,600 that’s enough get good scientific understanding precedence statistically significant results. It’s breaking news it’s important medically get exact statistics covid. generally know kills older people young people doesn’t mean scientists shouldn’t try figure exactly much deadly Right. point many people bring schools send home EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD. point teachers people we’re sending die don’t want watch kids global catastrophe. 

This like mom disaster movie passed kid summertime else running crowd. really get upset guy mentioned reason Whenever fly again, I’ll consider it. ICUs filling Italy, healthier younger patients mean, already lied American people. He's fine. Thanks misread USA far cases countries?

We 2k active cases Australia. many million currently infected USA?

edit: Adjusted population like USA 16k active cases. least president cause us panic!

Was even following news? People panicked bought entire stores. wife works hospital temperature screening recorded 94-95 degrees several times colder days (back March/April). really gives lot confidence would ever catch someone running 101 degree fever. You’re dumber thought. SARS. know name disease, right?

SARS-CoV-2. Don’t worry I’m interested visiting coastal city lmao Ah, good ol' vitro study. much promising vitro trials utter shit put live, actual human. mean, point healthy people coming overseas really playing Russian roulette. lot research suggesting vitamin big help keeping covid infection getting serious.

Given accessibility safety supplements, recommending everyone know take vitamin D, especially fall winter roll in. Depends data. interested overall death toll mourn set different public policy, no, matter. interested precise epidemiological virulence measure (perhaps compare pandemics) yes, certainly does. Think like death tolls war. always two numbers, deaths combat, deaths disease deprivation. latter throughout history always much higher former. many reasons someone might die pandemic, would died time frame without pandemic, *but even virus*. That's different category epidemiologically. Yes level. anti-US hivemind makes feel like I'm Infowars looking info New York Times. [Such US top-25 current infection rate, nowhere near #1, \~350k cases behind #1 (India) total cases. Every year Chinese, maybe 1 billion, travel Chinese New Year (return hometown). Chinese New Year year several days Wuhan lockdown. impossible stop people travelling immediately. tradition thousands years. Delicious flavors. Like vanilla. covid identified yet knew respiratory illness caused coronavirus. guys arguing like people saying covid kill actually pneumonia it. ""obviously flawed""? “I think you’re gunna fine”

With degree collegeisawasteoftime U?

How permanent lung damage fine you? Children deformed damaged hearts okay you? suddenly sure tens thousands teachers fine deadly global pandemic? dont need lock down, people need wear masks wash hands social distance. Dude, sub full /r/sino people. Literally time china comes up, watch. US require quarantine, ""recommended.""  public already basically deals process pregnancy tests. They've gotten massively better recent decades process still, positive likely pregnant follow up. negative 100% mean negative. that's people normally would die given day also

By measure we've well 200,000 dead weeks ago. Lol. amazing people trying act like simple. ...really? 

“So far, new upturn infections resulted surge deaths, small fraction levels March April, pandemic tore Europe’s nursing homes. Many new patients younger healthier, testing expanded vastly -- turning asymptomatic infections previously went undetected -- treatment improved.” Getting architecture degree athletic scholarship sounds like masochism. could that.  International students. 

They're coming fun, they're coming got accepted Research US get college equal standing home country, there's particular program professor really wanted study university. US colleges *love* international students always pay full tuition.  ok. Work places schools free game government worker like civil servants dont really need bother. ^They ^can ^work ^from ^home. can, join ""Pre-Check"" little convenient Sadly, feel going common instead headlines. Especially head cold/flu season.

I can't imagine children going feel get sick, bring home family tragedy happens. unfair around. lot nursing home workers ""unskilled nursing care"" workers. change sheets, wash residents, clean soiled underclothes, etc.

This tough grueling underappreciated work requires long hours.

However requires basically advanced schooling it, there's reasonably large pool workers it.

Add fact vast majority Americans facilities Medicare pays bottom barrel rates facilities stuck cutting costs wherever can.

Many workers making 12 13 dollars hour work Americans would find unpleasant best, intolerable worst. Basic statistics? Proof manipulation death data? Big conspiracy claims zero proof. Florida may perfect comes reporting I've never seen proof us hiding deaths article 

But sure, 300 people 250k. Who's counting right?


""The state counted 124 infections among people attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in August released estimate secondary infections linked rallygoers. Health officials across 12 states found 300 people infections attended rally, including Minnesota man died.""

The ""study"" linked massively debunked gets flagged misinformation. makes feel better, keep posting. Nah, stopped testing. Colleges schools start bumping up. read article? Exponential growth. It’s gonna explode night.  Please dont dont want right Population increased since government encourage immigration region, birth rates across different ethnicities less similar. believe Chinese gov trying control Uighur population, look birth rates Han Chinese region. folk bonkers. 

It'll ""gone"" right around holidays. Watch. 200,000 dead months. Trump called hoax tv night grandfather died. knew deadly fuck months that. 

Those ask facts need take seriously. might help hospital video legal America go find tape intubated trying pull tube throats failures watch glass. Check lung damage treatments. that’s you’re taking seriously need help. fear mongering. 100 things - aunt, basketball fan, bbq aficionado - headline picks teacher know inspires reaction. didn’t get Covid teaching, school isn’t open, job isn’t relevant fact put headline. crazy Fauci backing Trump heck going matter even virus? come Australia need quarantine 2 weeks. tested least couple times. medical treatments exist without capitalism. flew US Switzerland. unsafe felt standing line CDC check. rest time far enough away people, mask hygiene poor, people spread out, lines moving slowly. would one thing actually administered test, taking temperature standing line tons people seems actually counterproductive. supress disease cases allow visitors care homes. Like Norway.
But Sweden encourage people go straight society regardless come home example Madrid hotspot. recommend people go work even live together confimed sick Covid.

And earlier pandemy Tegnell adviced using face masks care homes. started using face masks care homes nurses visiting elderly homes death rates Sweden plummet. many people dying car crashes covid.

Back reality, killed around 6 times people entire year car accidents.  even screen them. Unless remotely checking passengers temperatures. ignorant classmate last semester travel Italy first week March wife, return flight bragging big deal checking passengers customs. flew Milan locked three days returned. Link? 

Because every post seen featuring Dr Fauci, quoting him, referenced guidance regarding coronavirus, need protect it. There’s least one miracle cures news everyday.  It’s eventually forcing everyone distance learning whether like anyway. going kill hundreds/thousands extra people along way first. would like point irony people thinking US could easily adopt Sweden model. sort people usually quick point US comparable Sweden used example social reform. cite nature says 6-12% pre-symptomatic.  Shouldn’t FEMA use money help sort shit out? again- probably wouldn’t problem took seriously back January/Feb Blaming victims easy way say one else responsible. avoiding hospitals though. recall correctly, wages actually earn, yes would assume collect info tax filings. unemployment receiving money already contributed system via taxes. essentially like insurance. pretty positive stimulus also count towards taxable income, would assume unemployment received gonna express sympathy hilariously odious comment I'm gonna say I'm glad relatives ate shit lmaoo anti-dictatorship propaganda

You CCP bots getting worryingly convincing Posting something add discussion rare nowadays? Yes! problem demand driven testing asymptomatic!

So theory, EVERY person living would tested 100% accurate test. Then, people test positive quarantined they're better...and bam thing like month. Also, either shutdown borders test quarantine everyone coming country.

That's theory. reality travel US logistics testing everyone far simple.

The countries well now, generally countries recent pandemics/outbreaks they've thought stuff 20-30 years took steps towards it. roof. roof. roof fire ... Yea thanks Carlos pretty awesome! also put Indiana coronavirus sub! like 2020 (or 20 years Fox) 'skill' getting American Public believe non-science narrative they're trying push, Fauci hot that. One reasons watch listen everything say he's actually given chance. fact taken ""corona briefings"" bewildering obvious science part agenda virus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not mention Administration harping ""great reaction corona virus"" we're approaching 200k deaths... Actually logical agree fact 25% probably enough keep restaurants afloat, realistically think meant first step.

Again, baby steps, NY end like rest country.

25% barely anything, 50%? things stable November 1st, that's looking at. question really is, think keep things control beta-testing period 25%, get 50%, i.e. ""real"" goal reopening? Haha stick sneakers dude short period people dying covid higher rate would expected causes over.

CDC data fact 96% COVID deaths average 2.6 causes death found like I'm linking Alex Jones anything. CDC information. sub doesn’t humor Idk man. Trump says vaccine available November. wait till then? Germicidal UV air scrubbing tricky creates LOTS ozone process. obviously ozone awful lungs. easy slapping UV lights couple vents. Also, next way ensure ""clean"" air reaches everybody without virus transmitted person person. Definitely especially b January? local counties leading campaign governors office state education department wrestle back control schools open right now, despite state worst state US community spread. almost 75% parents backing them. think lots schools pushing forward opening matter spread. saw Fox News today commercial break, asked wtf would want got here. explains **List potential cures:**

1. ~~Hydroxychloroquine~~
1. ~~Sodium hypochlorite~~
1. ~~T-Virus~~

All ideas guess chose sit thought while. prerogative, suppose. shit communicating

Word *And stop coming, stop coming, stop coming, stop coming, stop coming...*

Help! I've washing hands 10 minutes now! Ugh, sad. Could imagine kids classes teachers die COVID? That's going lasting impact sure. :( means hard compare countries take grain salt.

Over months, I've read small island countries great leadership kept virus out, etc.

Also, covid spreads easily...so countries kept eventually high infection rates.

In US people move around people come country...literally takes 1 case start chain reaction spread like wildfire live normal lives.

People like make covid situations easy compare, far simple. Here's [Sweden's case actually looks like somewhat poor job mid-June (though certainly worst offenders global stage). also worth noting recent uptick cases, hopefully trend discontinues. Sweden still ~1,300 new cases week. 

Plus looking specific examples talking people anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence useful place, usually someone asks source mean scientifically peer-reviewed article. anecdotal observations, accurate, might exception rule. Like, maybe fact Sweden cooler makes suitable approach. Without scientific evidence, can't know sure. 

My overall impression Sweden's system success, nations like South Korea better systems place. agree life can’t stopped blaming victim facts regarding transmission disease known straight ignorant. know I’m speaking void know fact certain actions could prevented death. Right, could bring water bottle full liquid coronavirus chemtrail country? TSA, post right here. Thank you. insane.

It's entirely hollow gesture meant placate dissent, keep anyone safe. 

The cognitive dissonance astounding.They might well mandate propellor hat. mean recreation facilities pandemic attract dumdums. I've teaching remotely since March virus students (and, extension, parents) give homework files. feel terrible choice go class, although teachers feel 'owe' school duty deranged! long you’d “give up” social distancing? Genuine question, 2 years COVID still around prevalent, would still saying same? Seems like Reddit ppl happy stay home forever I've seen reports saying China August 19 already us December No, could submit freedom information act request get emails.

But case trust ""source"" shield laws never verify ""source"" never release emails. even try. article says emails group people. No. change number get there...obviously. BTW, covered news, Europe told much smarter stamping virus running many new cases per day USA. brother wife CO signed asthmatic nephew in-person schooling, opted fully remote. district stopped in-person options go virtual. don’t get it. Risking kid’s life convenience potential wage growth. 🤮 international travelers? Who’s coming America days? dumb enough smart realize I'm fed bs. they're also eating Halloween candy, literally every kid I've ever met they're walking around Halloween, meaning likely spit hands transfer virus. 

Just insane anyone would take risk could million fun activities kids home. They'll survive without one year trick-or-treating. Load text, direct answer question. Yeah average 530 past 4 days. Fewer reported Saturday/Sunday/Monday combined yesterday.  words dear leader: “PEOPLE SAYING!!” Sweden average person smarter usa really hope randomly die ""heart attack"" ""car accident"" ""mugging gone wrong, execution style"". literally said knew lying. decades old research. course masks work. science. politics ideology. get idolization man. 

Also plural hypothesis hypotheses certainly understand scientific method far better thanks condescension. problem plan, attitude citizens trying work little actually put place. makes sick see arguing freedom choice wear mask.

I scream screen sometimes.

YOUR FREEDOM INCLUDE ENDANGERING OTHERS SELFISH PIECE SHIT. Yeah, let's try thinking ourselves. Crazy, right? sky falling narrative sells everything fine. fact kids school teachers, parents, grandparents gonna die kids online classed. admit yes I’m okay people dying you’re pro school teaching. vaccine partially claimed NIAID, even don’t trust Moderna, trust Fauci’s teams? given [the] title Martyr, [was] mentioned ceremonies [his?] full social benefits system [of our] fellow Merican[s'] su[r]prise, give man/woman [who] fell wars [the] title “sucker” “loser”.

Reads like quite standard L2 English me... surprise still get international passenger think ***any*** reasonable safety 600+ kids crammed school building, helping conversation. least five different “strains” Swedish fauna checked last. Three main ones sidekicks. biggest mistake imo dropping every rules summer started. Masks gone, everything gone. worst part people starting act even masks limiting freedom like..I thought better USA, literally thing, come guys.

Slováci, můžu k vám? U vás lidi berou dost líp. lmao literally think response paid price it, don’t get use example it’s proof ‘point’ ? May ask... local news paper may want cover story country fucking joke affordable daycare, especially midst pandemic.

In times like these, government subsidizing daycare programs, schools, jobs can't operate lockdown.

Instead, U.S government throwing hands saying ""we absolute bare minimum, nothing worked, hell it, get back work!"" millions upon millions U.S adults stuck 2 decisions.

1. take virus seriously, quit job homeschool send kids school, suffer financially probably lose home, car, ect.?

Or 2. throw hands air well say ""to hell it, I'm going business usual"" order avoid losing means living?

Many obviously choosing 2, make mistake it, entirely r#&amp;publican's fault (screw automod censoring truth) Ohio.  Ah...ok...WHO decides “what I’m worth?” accomplish decision?

Can name socialist countries successful level western capitalism countries? (and leave Scandinavian countries hyper-capitalist initially building massive sovereign wealth funds absurd national resources) bar graph pretty telling. 


I'm surprised reversed. Shocked even.


You would think bottom group would close 100% waiting line, getting back seconds, begging... ''YES!!! Please, sir, may please?''



Shocking!!! give fuck You’re kinda dumb aren’t ya? AZ SARS-CoV-2 vaccine phase 3s entirely single blinded started US regulators forced quad blinded. It’s one reasons US clinical trial gold standard. it’s 1/15000 wouldn’t 0.01% chance? years? always letting sound like masses people. talking TWO individuals here. Mostly, plays current reddit anti-Trumpist sentiment. matter english pretty bad; redditors give two craps China do; care crapshow America lol. found Diabetes associated increased risk outcome univariable analysis (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.41-2.36; P &lt; .001) **but reach statistical significance adjustment (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.73; P = .06).** re-opened wet markets beg differ. entire administration, tons countries well. shortage masks time, scientific body research small studies shown cloth masks effective. Yeah would need one lasts stop talking. No, understand frustrations also gotta understand want end like countries (USA ehm ehm)

Even tho agree government enforcing rules honestly mess, think mask one good thing have. Headlines focus negativity. OP correct don’t care cases “We didn’t expect people die death pit forced go.” 
-Ignorant honchos Yes I'm sure happened USA, much larger scale.  0.5% population gets dies... 

So 0.5% 2% (0.01%), 1 10000?

In America, call ""acceptable losses"".

As American, fear current path, especially not-so-small minority us willing press forward normalcy even 1% us die. hit 200,000 deaths, essentially lost 0.06% population COVID-19.

And people willing press forward 16 times amount. Yes well hard get guys start ignoring evidence listen health God ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Idiot. realise tha trials, meant expose stuff like this? Fully released vaccines side effects like this. There's teacher earth gets paid enough put lives line teach. Thank you. read articles seem NYC results show widespread infection interesting. 

My concern terrible death toll inability work together simple solutions let us ride instead playing right left sports..ahem..politics. Shame build technological wall transmissable diseases instead spaffing money largely ineffective physical wall, dismantling pandemic early warning program. I’m American familiar TSA, actually part government private company? 450k went see Smashmouth? Wow.

A massive multinational company selling special mean fatty processed foods high sugar sprite pandemic obesity main death factor hugely popular musician live appearance anyone would know would cause frenzy crowd fans show. get basically packed small concert young people know highest spreaders right now. 

It's lit???? Time elect new public officials sounds awful one go mitigated. don’t want invade privacy, wonder number factors. Maybe enough people died economy yet issue blows mind single university entire province live. like double! Offices use TON power Like eating brains? country tests landed would defeat purpose.

False. countries tests arrive. I'm looking available data reaching conclusion. is:

In places, pandemic basically over. media reports ""cases"" deaths. deaths fallen back normal, pre-pandemic level. Here's link CDC shows deaths COVID calculated excess see chart places pandemic basically over. amount people dying causes back normal.

Something else deliberately ignored sub CDC reported 94% cases, people died COVID average 2.6 causes death. 

That data found healthy immediately allowed resume normal life sick old anything like that, certainly choose take precautions. Also schools REFUSE let teacher work remotely many particular school working online, either person basically resign. Paranoia symptom. Google it. understand correctly, ""clear efficacy"" past meant 60% users experienced benefits trial. think read willing accept number 50% case medical community agrees even 50% vaccine would help us case. understanding well? Well shut people went panic mode quickly jammed every grocery store wiping everything shelter course masks social distancing . empty kept up. lowes.and home depot allowed stay open as.essential. people bored place else to.go let's crowd along Walmart. masks social distancing . complain total lockdown even worse China . rights. Never known flu make blood coagulate, 1 many many reasons   nothing actually... Also consider taking Vitamin Zinc.  Ah, damn. medical ones, I'll use hopefully improves/goes away. Thanks. :) first business trip 2018. also slept in, biggie though, live 15 mins airport. Flight 7:00 am, make airport 6:05. Apparently check 1 hour flight, tried checking 6:07 allowed anywhere near boarding gate. conversation boss/owner fun lol.  even allow sports? deemed safe indoor gatherings close contact, likely includes sweat touching?

Might well allow spectators they're wearing masks six feet apart well. said something similar freelancemomma's false equivalencies regarding flu covid well essential (presumably) downvoted otherwise engage. Apparently well facts science like. ""Make South Dakota Final Destination"" even mandatory hand washing? 

My kids wash hands come start touching everything, snacktime/lunch playing outside. joined Pre-Check year ago, used couple times, covid hit. needing all, intend traveling anywhere covid control. That’s awful, glad recovered! confusion dizziness accompanied headaches / fever? People seem get this. I've seen much 'But X, makes sense can't Y!' Every contact potential exposure virus. We're trying limit contacts. Sure, question contacts limit. limiting contacts (unless want go back lockdown, scrap measures). look like limited number contacts have, still keep R0 1. divide pie? Opening schools seems useful meeting 5 people socially. read article describes model community transmission LA began late December, SUBSEQUENT outbreak Wuhan. Epidemiologists virologists around globe knew mid December emerging coronavirus threat. know extent whether would spread outside Asia. Obviously, take consideration international travel patterns Chinese Wuhan region. area backwards isolated village mountains, proven much harder contain global transmission. stark reality China manufacturing commerce giant compared even decade ago. execs, reps &amp; sales force travel world many times over, bringing whatever asymptomatic diseases them. guess 900,000+ people weren’t enough Please Let get straight.

You want come US.

In middle pandemic.

Right Presidential election incumbent might try foment civil war results come out. 

You blend right in. Welcome land stable geniuses. Exactly, it’s forums like helped keep sanity. whole masks thing never made sense. pretended ""concern"" Sturgis.. fun financial security economy worsen, yes.

And money spend invest worst passed.

Thanks pearls wisdom. 2, work medic though. One 30, 35. Lost coworkers close too. 65ish year old 40 y/o. without known medical history. weird, probably know 50 people flu like symptoms... time March, putting 50 people vents 25 bed ER. humans mate. American thing, believe countrymen worse better nations, rest us flawed, brilliant, capable useless. think people nervous wanna die. taking precautions go out, give even glance people talking like that. think anything awkward dating right now. Lol non-answer. Okay really want believe thats okay. COVID described someone chronic fatigue lung/heart/brain issues would obese 99% time. Thanks link. agree CFR. widely known reliable indicator actual mortality rate long time now. That's mentioned IFR.

To best knowledge reproduction rate known entirely, clearly high enough sustain pandemic even public health policies place.

I've following subreddit since March, disagree hyperbole. Sometimes wonder people see want see. notice different types reactions here. Overreactions under-reactions. point, anybody done basic research knows end world virus. also know virus still big deal because, even .5 - 1% IFR, still killed unimaginable amount 6 months still know long term ramifications physical, emotion, economic health. U.S. track 3rd leading cause death 2020.

Sure, balance needs determined physical, economic, mental health. U.S, failed failing 3 issues. Yet keep barreling ahead... need umbrella whole country drowning. makes zero sense. Whats cost living like?

At $900 USD per month, could maybe stay sheltered fed US, would renting tiny apartment desirable city, budgeting every left penny food. Hope already car though, non desirable city certainly public transportation usable level work. Also, $60-80k jobs would far city/town, cheap cost living areas would massive TV studios afford wage.

This directed specifically, foreigners tend idea crazy expensive exist US. governments around world subsidize provide lot citizens, pay everything al la carte. Also, even make $80k year, buy anything, also paying people make (relatively) high wages too.  people live northern hemisphere though. 4 year, 50 trillion dollar question anti-masker ignoring science? Yes *is* always ends. Wtf think symptoms sickness are? Complications infection organs. still saying, ""Viruses make sick make sick."" vaccine similar stage development, need rush potentially problematic vaccine options table. pikachu surprised face San Jose California earliest cases TSA screeners (which makes total sense contact lot people). Testing people like regularly help random TSA temperature screens infect many. far. Skimming cream crop smart countries do. 

In idiocracy considered awful foreigners pollute wonderful uneducated white population Trump likes brag about. Allowed China buy ppe could find stores warehouses send home leaving none us allowed. Please panic. slightly 800 people tested positive currently hospital. 1257 hospitals United Kingdom. hadn’t started school yet. attended teacher workshops showed symptoms. sounds like infection related profession. Still tragedy don’t like spin. get that. tired people shaming others life right now. taught PK 90 minutes today, touched 7 damp masks trying help put on/give dry paper one. One girl chewing entire mask mouth. wash hands sanitize much possible, much kids try, masks still worn improperly. So, safe remind different kid every 5 minutes put mask nose? You’d surprised. attack rate close contacts isn’t near high everyone seems assume.

Covid works large numbers scale. one contact pretty small chance transmission. spread large population you’re guaranteed small chance hit more. That's understanding too. 

One interesting thing **appears** instances flu dropped near zero physical distancing, hand washing mask wearing taken place. Australia flu season ended two months early gradually, dropped near zero. Covid likely far contagious flu interesting see flu knocked back season northern hemisphere except US consistently measures.  never got tested I'm like 85 percent positive January. paying full tuition typically undergrads. substantial proportion graduate students US foreign, like STEM fields. Many STEM fields generous financial aid policies, fully funded default.

Also, cases int'l undergrads pay full tuition, US undergrad programs offer little financial aid int'l students typically _have to_ pay full tuition, downgrade school quite bit get aid, try uber excellent try luck schools actually want go to. “Symptoms” fatigue, cough, headache, etc.

How many times last year feel tired cough? going bet least dozen times. doesn’t mean it’s connected COVID. think much effect all. terrorist would need set something middle queue folks lining security theater. “Pakistan used infrastructure developed fight polio tackle Covid-19,” said director general. “Community health workers, previously used vaccinate children polio, redeployed contact tracing monitoring.” intentionally leave important part quote completely debases argument.

""A mask appropriate someone infected prevent infecting someone else.""

Hmmm, reasoning wearing masks now? help prevent people infected know infecting others. Looks like Fauci spot on. February.

He also state effective way protect yourself. stating 100% effective. pretty big difference. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yep. often even poorly. I've seen footage casually like half second letting person pass simply moving next person, without even looking temperature was. like conveyor belt fucks given.

I know either way, would totally believe China less cases us, due way regime violently ruthlessly lockdown whatever want, whenever want, however want... people obey. get disappeared.

You going anti-mask assholes running amok Chinese stores they're lock down.  we? traveling. hate articles much, gives people around excuses chuck mask. People even wearing laundry room maskyess places masks Global entry includes pre-check amazing travel internationally it’s breeze go passport control. Cool story bro. really give fuck do, pointing hivemind's hypocrisy Also particularly true. Medical anomalies happen alllllll time. field medicine science data set doctors use asses risk. take risk factors pretty good idea sick get. 

We time, flu, colds, pneumonia (which know disease aftershock one). 

Young healthy people die flu too! make front pages relevant media topic. High accuracy comment, right here, Darnold. FTJ believe college waste time? Why? 

""How suddenly sure tens thousands teachers fine deadly global pandemic?"" 90% covid cases negative viral loads tests amplified 30 times, would result positive reading dead virus cells. Holy shit. Fuck Texas apparently. really miss playing basketball. Going one first things safe again. say year, may seem overwhelming young people year long, long time. people general discouraged. 

I wasn’t suggesting PSAs literally say “a bit longer” — something year more. 

Because think near normal next summer. Dr Fauci said much. choose believe him. alot things preexisting conditions

Crohns, rhumatoid arthritis, alopecia universalis (no hair all), eczema, karataconus (degenerative eye issue requires hard contacts reshape current mile time

So arthritis, run. sprints though. They're effective kicking butt, bother knees ankles.

I like rock climb year 1.5-2 hours 2-3 days per week prior getting sick. also hike lot. longest ever day hike Upper Yosemite Falls Eagle Peak El Capitan back start. 22 miles (~13 months ago) starting 4500 feet ~4000 feet elevation gain. took 14.5 hours would gone lot faster arthritis knee brace on.

This past June (~3 months ago), 14 mile hike started 6000 feet went 10000 feet. got top 3:15. post covid, concerned would take extra time, brought 5 L water. used 2 capable back squatting bodyweight

Typical gyms thing. find boring. would say no, probably could practiced form.

I 15 pullups helps. Whenever there's report isolated early case country people predictably chiming ""OOOH BAD COUGH DECEMBER ALWAYS THOUGHT MIGHT'VE COVID"" take proof, ignoring illnesses still exist?? get circulated?? Especially winter??? Bleh. Agreed. constant US-bashing xenophobic. Antimaskers, obesity, racism every country. US many best universities, philanthropists, athletes world.  Maybe strike risk isint great teachers others risking neck.  Lol. worry son, failed hardly considered offensive effective enough ever considered attack.

Low energy. Sad.

I scour history, clicked user name relevant data upset exposed right top.

Reddit information available reason, kiddo.

You worth energy engaging with, sorry. hobby mine see dumbass comment verify already know; account year old posts conservative cesspool subs.

Sorry let everyone know banned account know opinions unpopular want seen history account posts reputable subreddits with.

I like letting folks know exactly are. Deadly super spreader: get influenza covid-19(with symptoms) also sneeze everywhere, think get flu Seriously. family ""backup"" another state luckily got first choice. slouch though, worth first pick cases even in-person interview.

That backup school forced everyone back work middle first wave website statement basically said give shit young people fine anyways.

We *still* would've unable see/visit get safety accommodation shitstorm. “Lock up! Lock up!” endorsement. China recorded local cases hence EU approved travel Sounds like sort mental illness play.

Edit: read evaluated mental illness custody found fine, throwing things window sounds like someone straddling line mild problems. Wearing masks inconveniences liberals too. won’t republicans pass mask mandate sole reason ? mom got super sick August. thought related condition time. Depends they're leaving house for. going get much needed food, nourishment? going work, earn much needed income? going bars, parties, family get togethers? There's difference there. longer safety, safety may come contact possibly contacting virus. funny. Florida long time ago, brain dead woman named Terry Schiavo. GOP desperately tried save saying preserve ""life costs"". party life needs amend that, ""unless costs much"" 

A 28 year old school teacher died SC. someones grandma? 

The fact easily willing sacrifice anyone's grandmda kinda makes monster. Stay away mine. 

Finally. get it. can't fix economy without PEOPLE. Even likely republican county going what.. Say 30% population deemed safe generally stay home. Shockingly people actual republicans. Perhaps slightly higher risk republicans. way fix economy make safe everyone participate. GOP exact opposite that, start.  Yep exactly like thought. Excuses excuses try peddling anti-mask bullshit without single iota scientific understanding. Pathetic. what’s gonna happen, semester next. next year story half country doesn’t vaccinate. Right people really know degree virus effect dont really know health status 100%. Thats see obese example well others tank.

Im pretty sure viral load/wearing masks also plays this.... We're going DESTROY. THE. WALL 👐 I'm pretty confident Europeans still allowed enter USA anyway. There's travel ban added March remember, remember lifted tourists, student visa. bothers news evidence, health ministery allowed anything, news University Sannio, news prof's webpage, news uni spin-off (because website apparently), scientific pubblications, basically anything. company produces lighthing hardware able produce diagnostic systems? company owner called ""doctor Stefania Magni"", doctor what? cannot find information yet, italian..

From Ministery perplexity news. meantime, basically every low level news website wrote awful articles that, even ""good"" journals. Okay, Mr./Ms. Ignorant. Whatever helps feel important. all. sub science based sub (with little doomsdayism sprinkled in) science antithetical trump's positions. much we're anti trump trump anti-us. I'll tell - first time boy misses opportunity make worse, I'll first say so.  There’s winter break tho Without scientific rigor egregious part news absolutely LOVES virus everyone stuck home, guessed it, watching news. reports virus dangerous people thought often ignored. Like news still showing China's infection numbers months everyone knows China lies basically everything. disingenuous. expected believe America (300m) cases China (1.3b). actually 45%.  New York, state highest coronavirus death toll, plays games counting LTC coronavirus deaths.

  headline gave stroke frustrating people bitching loudest lockdowns ones whose actions keep making lockdowns necessary. 

""I'm tired us wear bulletproof vests time!"" said, randomly shot gun every direction. strategy (their strategy based serious, sustainable measures prevent infection, herd immunity)

That's Tegnell kept flogging herd immunity imminent Also clearly folly sustainable strategy paying dividends right (deaths negligble, less infection nordics). sustainable strategy going look better out.

They 6x deaths per capita Nordic countries, well severe recession. strategy was. Thank much! Little Shaming truth two different things. country whose population large percentage obese people. arguing fact. 

It takes long time someone obese get weight control. 

However, now, biggest health risks obese people things like diabetes heart disease, higher risk cancers-- take time develop. 

I never life known obese person die viral infection, unless elderly, you? 

Do act high mighty assuming ""fat"" people seen coming. know health risk, lives much meaning people suffer drug addiction, gaming addiction, anger issues, etc. etc. Imagine many us failed coping mechanisms, unfortunately dangerous others, however, shaming never ever effective tool preventing assisting them. Sure, there's next way knowing came someone school. lot teachers caught went school knows long showing symptoms passing virus. believe that's going growing theme. 

I personally feel vast majority schools open infection rate high areas. I'd rather proactive reactive comes people lives. Places like NYC low infection rate moment, sure let school learning precautions place. Houston Texas hand business school learning. Yes.

People need stop downvoting crucial information. Sure! great shark repellent sell you, interested. eaten shark since started wearing it.

Correlation causation. states fire take away pension Unionize Strike. Texas sure, mom forced retire. Nope, really.  imagining world truck driver used make great living goes work field somewhere less poverty wages previously immigrant farm workers employed. farms paying now? doubt works. Im racist im using example things people personally want get vaccinated soon possible (and no, like Trump, want get vaccinated Covid). I'm wondering...if bunch people first group eligible vaccine (immunocompromised, elderly, etc) want vaccine, make potential ""extra"" doses open general public earlier supposed able get it?

I mean, think it, people vaccine general means people high risk groups protected. Where’s Flu Crew? Would love hear mouth breathers now. basically comes voting party point. voting specific person anymore, voting people associate with. grateful change procedure underwear bomber. may mild allergy something mask material.

Also, I'm one wears mask. “The 1918 pandemic killed young adults well spent year mutating trenches France kill men fighting WWI.”

Sorry flu killed young men instant appeared Kansas near military encampment. poster added, due cytokine storm: said original response, immune system’s response killed them. International students diplomats? Hopefully flight empty mostly. Yup, get people scared much, everyone (especially news sub) loves downplay fact, sometimes pretend exist. Oh yeah I've lost track amount comments I've deleted. automod even filters first letter party name colors. I've also remove posts name know who. did? wouldn’t positivity rate way instead Got covered. I'm Germany. go door without masks nobody looks twice. It’s clear view you’re attached to. Good luck it. Americans live abroad, visiting family friends. American lives Florida, made stop think second. It’s irresponsible headline. ever hear school referred “FSU”. also don’t watch sports, perhaps that’s don’t hear term “florida state” context.  Amazing ain't it? like call shit FREEDUMB! cruel? well maybe thats im native speaker ive never encountered situation describing behavior harshly big deal Thank you. Im sick people acting like everyone equal chance dying this. disease affects elderly obese, thats pretty much it. *thousands* doctors administrators spent lives defending public health bend political pressure release something unsafe?

Good lord, ever trust people? Like much Europe currently going second wave? questions whether novel spreading earlier thought, according study electronic medical records.

Aug 16, end Wow, socialism suggested, people call out, error.

When schools stopped teaching civics - well teaching well. Lets face it, sat many sessions kids - teacher ignorant topic. 

FWIW, ex GT Teacher year history, state, always asking questions history. admitted knowledge much weaker mine, always trying catch aggressive summer programs. 20 years later, still taught 9th grade.

Education bad now, impossible even discussion, enough knowledge understand bad is.

And comments posting show why.

Start trashing now. royal penis clean highness Nope, never shut International travel - even it. article pass Rule #5?

**Rule 5: keep information quality high**

**You contribute high-quality information.** require users submit reliable, fact-based information subreddit (as opposed opinion articles, advocacy, etc), provide English translation article comments. many places online discuss conspiracies speculate. ask here. saw IND year two ago. Kinda annoys caught on. declining cases positivity rate? could stopped international flights fine. chose to. whole country zero support, forget Trump administration refused organize nation wide response forced States bidding wars needed medical York badly hit Dear Leader shit mobilize Federal resources, country, effective state preparedness pandemic came stopped outbreak state. 6 deaths yesterday, 629 cases. Keep harping someone successful endeavors protect people state elected by.

Given allegiance Trump, guess seems ass backward you.

Florida: 2,056 cases, 202 deaths.


Where evidence scientist stalker lunatic? correct, let go cases surged. Florida cases New York 200k 20k behind Texas.

Florida reduced testing refused publish school data firing whistle blower fired correct public prediction evidence tampering. Right?

Here's audio, one time. waiting list season ticket football (soccer) team support 3 years, emailed 2 weeks ago say finally eligible season, buy can't next season, issue they're still playing behind closed doors cases rise. I'll like £600 pocket placeholder next year. heartbreaking. I've waited moment since 13 I'm finally earning money chance live dream mine taken away. Certain mods sub definitely agenda

They removed post Dr Zhong receiving award ceremony, citing allow post another guy 'not receiving' award stay on.

And confront mod it, TF cares dude got award. Great, good think protesters wore masks, one bite eat protests, one hugged another protestor? Google multiple photos showing many wear masks, lots ate/drank, many hugged other. Bill Gates sneaks night asleep implants them, using backdoor built Windows Illuminati. Crafty bastard. sitting president would touting vaccine. problem sub doesn’t like president, anything says = bad. one involved vaccine development said don’t work, fact talked highly vaccine. leading national experts health officials saying trust vaccine, vaccines Trump pure political.

Just remember, Biden elected, approving vaccines Trump touting right now. I’m sure would problem vaccine moment. kids school open two weeks missouri. article feels misleading. trying imply teachers died returned school got Covid school.

None stories indicated that. early year, covid kill quickly. indicated got Covid way anyone gets died.... happen teachers. ready could mean everything manufactured distributed, comes approval. Semantics aside, October would fall “before end year” timeline. Thoughts family, many need read people understand real? Confirmed Case Long-Hauler Survey 1,500 individuals, 82% respondents reported symptoms lasting two months, 41.9% respondents experienced symptoms three months 12.5% respondents experienced symptoms four months. Allie Iamonaco explains experiencing fever chest pain among symptoms 100 days. think vastly underestimate much people enjoying seeing movie big screen. Exactly. They’re basically “getting know” assignments working online kinks. may matter much. seems pretty unlikely adults access vaccine election.

Big vaccine approved election, even so, nobody 70+ year olds and/or front line workers access November. Lockdowns slow rate infection hospitals overwhelmed everyone gets treatment available. Kicking road exactly originally meant do.

They quite successful preventing hospitals overwhelmed. read stories people dying lack medical treatment supplies since horrible early days italy New York.

I goal switched eliminating covid preventing cases rather delaying spreading out. clearly lockdowns effective eliminating virus. sure ever thought would be, that's spin. Yes know. think it’s people dying that’s making people afraid send kids school. See beginning post human lost life said yada yada yada? That’s people don’t want be, another dead body mocked online. 

In post you’ve described all. People die this, children carry better adults get heart damage often adults, give adults worse adults. Teachers America’s supported way stop blooms occurring people die, others lung damage heart damage nerve damage. We’ve done autopsies kids idea them. 

It’s great mongering you’re hospital watching grandfather try yank seven inch tube throat drugs worn he’ll never see family person again. died waited family room Trump called hoax tv. Can’t make shit up.  Nope. based passport. I've never seen anywhere bad see sub. Curious consider quarantining car acceptable option? Brilliant strategy Absolutely brilliant. Make PR stunt, make people go record either welcoming students nervously pulling collars refusing like cowards everyone knows are. kills people even vaccine. data says children super spreaders covid. fact, data points opposite. 

How come entirely opposite opinion facts support? article says large fractions young people *who hospitalized COVID* bad outcomes.

It says nothing hospitalization rate. still true young people much better prognosis older people.

It also still true small fraction young people die, unknown fraction young people experience serious long-term health consequences.

It also apparent everyone time young people getting sick passing illness along vulnerable populations.

In short, need make argument trying make (the risk death even intensive care high young people) really true, order make argument young people taking seriously using caution--for long-term health health others.  COVID early (probably exposed February). 40 reasonably good health (not marathoner could walk couple miles without issue) COVID. never “severe” symptoms (no ventilator, hospitalization necessary, obvious breathing problems). However, months later, still dealing occasional “relapses” - coughing, low-grade fever, headaches; get light-headed climb steep staircase 100+ year old home quickly climb one hill afternoon walk; still leaves winded even though it’s 1/2 mile less. can’t afford go doctor check permanent organ damage insurance covers (with co-pay) initial doctor visit tests aren’t blood work “labs” (tests bodily fluids/secretions) ordered doctor. name calling bothers me. heavy upvoting insult. agree certain degree. necessarily agree silencing people making fun America right now, agree I'm going say silenced I've already argued silenced certain topics.

I agree need stop belittling crapping nation(at least ones US). Ironically, situation due freedom we've given, lot people take granted, separation powers inevitably make response much slower significantly different across nation. characteristics normally make nation great, right downfall. 

Mods individuals create sub moderate content added handle reports made. mind, free content uploaded fast read. way ever able get delete things find bad reporting them, work agree can't keep everything uploaded added.   Sounds like conspiracy. 110,000 died awaiting appeal, denied initially. see bother peer review.

It's preprint ... census - 42% Uyghur

2010 census - 45.84% Uyghur

2015 census - 46.42% Uyghur

Overall population also increased. genocide narrative... fly internationally, Global Entry $15 includes pre-check, $85 own. Even fly international while, it’s worth it.

Once I’m international flight, I’m already waiting bag 5-10 minutes later. It’s one best investments make lessen stress flying. 

Realistically though pre-check, lot airports I’ve sometimes like pull crap combine regular line pre-check line give slip paper keep shoes everything else like laptops liquids come out. 

In pre-check line you’re supposed able keep laptops liquids bag, keep mind occasionally disappointed pre-check it’s still worth it. work 60 hours week mid level job country's biggest tv news network make 900 dollars month. 

A similar position competing US network would around 70-80k usd year. America great want make money. isn’t likely breaks every pathogen spreading model know, Covid spreading currently. 

There way could happened. 

This likely China soft manipulation US journalism.

A lit os assumptions go studies like these. Typically fee assumptions large enough yo invalidate study. one clearly lowered transmissivity Covid order make work. 

500 people Covid massive breakout way dying without active quarantine. 

This fake news sold news. ""Don't want people ~~stop shopping, working death, going school parents work death~~ cause panic.""

Gotta keep corporations afloat bodies exploit. even go near airport help it. Wtf? Ready comes approval. Ready year end means approval till then. Last time checked Winnie [still China. Disneyland Shanghai still ride. Looks like need shove chainsaw arse, spewing much shit late Phew!  internet, phones, use them, like 20 years crazy amount time, six months fuck sake grow bit? Unless you’re also wearing eye protection it’s pointless use N95. quarantine going Wuhan....  It’s flaw. It’s working intended. Gotta get wage slavers back work owner class continue exploit labour 3 weeks isn’t long term literally want punch every person see wearing mask wearing properly. 

And that’s reassuring! He’s even gonna going emergency section anything like that. 

I’m sure works know imaging section separate patients section. 

I’m trying find new n95 use. old ones used month ago idk use able, going finish degree Spain, I’ll figure plan get finished. 

I means ‘doomsdayer’ really see writing wall. matter wins election, going violence. America chucked fuck bucket. I’ve never happier Australian. 0 cases state we’re living like normal state leader job cares us keeping us safe we’re number political pawn advantage.. It’s fucking great! well that's good, I'm happy wrong that. Ok good points. work die get sick really able enjoy worked long hard for? landlords use company sort legalese minutia renting property anyways? 🙄 Careful; that’s wrongthink here. People think basically end world. It’s pathetic. Europe needs take virus seriously US really wants countries stop screening US!!! Ok, even return actual classroom, hosted one online class got sick right?

Edit- referring late teacher richland, sure teacher back classroom. lies problem. government shutdowns little support people needed it. worst line policies. Yah, people obese COPD worthy life you, huh? feel bad anyone life perfect; even know value life less others. Dirty, dirty words sub Fools exist countries. can't forget that. difference nations given disproportionate power bully pulpits. father retired 71. wanted wait mom got closer retirement age (they’re six years apart.) afraid six years mostly hanging around house still working going make depressed. complete misinformation. studies show lingering effects among insignificant portion population least several weeks. focused neurological cardiac symptoms nonhospitalized patients Im aware of. ongoing survey study UK showed 10% cases lingering symptoms 3 weeks. Trump touting might gain political ground makes us question honesty producers, science process.

That's recognizing history Trump supporters. forget, Trump populist, Republican. tests results legitimate? Latin American brethren go ahead take wait American vaccine may months away? Thanks tip! way crazies US behaving probably years control. even vaccine might happen anti-vax nutjobs Atlantic months ago wrote international travelers Europe Asia actually experiencing careful testing monitoring home countries. came USA saw negligent lazy TSA behaved cursory temp check. eye opening.

Comparative politics forking wonderful (and infuriating), helps us escape propaganda engage actual reality. Sweden functioning completely normally right 

No not. taking social distancing quite seriously. lockdowns masks*. 

There plenty instances things gone badly (like many countries), things perfect. happy admit that.

But initial strategy sustainable solution live while, minimize long term damage (factoring economic social factors well models). stuck with. 

Other countries opening closing reactively. taxing population. course everyone want follow restrictions closely lockdown period. people break restrictions. 

We going steady pace. People maybe got bit laxer times (e.g. spring, working home hardly met friends). met friends again. I'm still keeping distance strangers, meeting risk group people, feel symptoms *at all* stay home.

Collectivism big Sweden. Belief authorities big. nothing. something different many countries, whose media downright slandered us times... problematic. US, NYT saying ""It horrible Sweden nothing""... going better Sweden right wing people say ""doing nothing apparently works"". *We always something.*

Also, going get cold soon. going indoors more. expect peak (then also least one (I think two) 3 scenarios authorities prepared).

Sorry became little bit rant. Hopefully helps curiosity bit. 

\*Why masks? argument stay home slightest reason (also works generous paid sick leave many precarious jobs e.g. US). argument masks limits people spreading it. implementing masks may get sick people public (cause feel safer). far, masks seems worked. I.e. many sick people public masks *may* worse fewer asymptomatic spreaders without masks socially distance... everyone symptom stays home. course would. US COVID-19 homeland now. Welcome Coronavirus Land suckers. I've heard Finland similar regard. Furthermore, 675,000 **tests** performed inbound passengers,

They tests, they're screenings. Meaning massive waste resources. literally take people's temperature. since that's horrible way find infected people, found many. Lmao see we’re handling pandemic like vietnam Right clarified next comment first reply? You’re talking jobs signed risk.

Also fatality rates per year professions? think NYC hardest hit lost near 100 faculty staff  TSA deterrent effect, similar attacks repeated. 

Given violence-prone Americans be, guns belong aircraft cabins. 1918 pandemic killed young adults well spent year mutating trenches France kill men fighting WWI.

There’s also speculation 1918 pandemic, lot flu pandemics, smaller impact see elderly could flu strains largely cyclical elderly people 1918 already battled H1N1 flu strain believe 1840s really fully opened. Depends are, bars restaurants generally operating capacity I've been. Concerts still canceled. Sports still happen largely empty audiences. Churches still mostly online. Yeah know, meant moreso general. Kids inevitably teachers die thing wonder that's going affect psychologically. 

And yes, aware teachers die time like anyone else variety reasons -- fact we're simultaneously dealing affected COVID makes virus-related deaths hit harder IMO. article specifically one teacher listed asthma. individual articles typically list them. 

For instance 73 year old died heart attack covid. think almost every article I've read listed younger people die. Well dishonest metrics provided without context. 

Did mean that? rational honest headlines sell papers make Trump look like fucking America corporate handlers!! tops technology standards availability care rank us pretty low world. It’s interesting southern hemisphere countries basically flu, even ones like New Zealand brief lockdown followed return near normalcy. 

Part explanation may travel restrictions prevented flu imported northern hemisphere case good news northern hemisphere. international travel still limited, lack flu activity southern hemisphere means little imported north. Hospitals much stricter protocols PPE school. nurse profession trained deal sick.

Edit: also guess I’m sure many patients nurse interacts with. would think middle/high school teacher interacts maybe 100 students day? Maybe elementary school teacher interacts 30? kidding me? many died America huh? funny guys always like claim high ground irregardless whether actually deserve it. I'm ashamed American moment. never realized surrounded many fucking idiots whole mess started. isn’t dangerous job US moment.

No, **exactly** isn’t dangerous job US moment.

That exactly wrote:  **no dangerous job** US.

I posted list ten dangerous jobs US ""*sitting nice comfy room protected weather outside, chatting kids day*"" even make top ten list.  

Oh wait, may spoken soon: one entry talks limbs shorn-off operating chainsaws bleeding death woods crushed death falling trees. That's teachers do, right? Oh, read little futher turns talking **logging workers**, teachers. mistake. true: mean view comment says average unless edited you’re wrong. 

Saying someone advanced degree needs work 25+ years earn six figures bad deal seems wrong. disagree we’re Reddit commented. 

What Reddit police? lockdowns solve anything long run kick road. like plague inc

In seriousness I'm aware rare quite typical fevers virus watched #Alive morning, amazing btw, fearing exact scenario. May odds favour wait till colleges schools open month so. decline cases seeing right could window 2 months. It’s damn scary scenario play out. sigh.... Re-watching [first Coronavirus Task Force Briefing (Jan 31, 2020), contrast sandwiching Fauci in-between everyone keep saying ""the risk American people currently low"" trying say things like ""there definitely confirmed asymptotic spread Germany"" ""there many unknowns \[that make different flu\]"" ""we 100% accurate tests."" Trying set expectations pretty much ignored, overall general message ""don't panic, risk currently low"" even though accurate tests back statement :\\ hell not. people destination higher daily rate occurrences, safely discount people flying cause. know much money funneled corporate fucks TSA?

Are serious?

We're talking age old tradition bilking American taxpayers billions. 

lol? God makes freaking mad. I’m freaking mad want something change it. get college kids stay inside 2021? (or later government says it’s still safe) Supposedly start mass vaccination Brazil early SAO PAULO, Brazil — Clinical trials Brazil Chinese-made vaccine Covid-19 shown ""extremely positive"" results, widespread vaccination campaign could begin early December, governor Sao Paulo state said Wednesday. grandma refused try even consider one, dad thing ""for old people."" made impossible talk grandma least last 5 years life. dad started losing hearing late Plus, there's lot stigma folks disabilities hearing aids like assistive devices - visible devices make someone feel ""othered,"" demoralizing.

That kind thought process would people poor vision refusing wear glasses, also makes problem visible. needed 12, say, ""No, that's old people, I'd rather barely able see."" one says that, know hearing. Wearing hearing aid less stigmatizing person can't hear anything. work mostly older people, helping family history research, simply pay attention ears. days people might various ear pieces anyway.

That sucks worse type hearing loss people get. real argument ""terrorist attacks killed far fewer people COVID"" case; ""the TSA successfully found stopped single terrorist attempt since inception, third party tests clearly show they're incapable reliably preventing someone getting security protocols. Yeah agreed. I'm glad Canada right eh? Nope, thank science Pretty cool make bad decisions want always someone else blame it. 

Walking free. know right!? There's many Americans think covid death sentence understand exactly saying. takes second maskhole gets space. kind clarifying wrote. matter careful are, much people refuse care society themself. Context important, state percentage people age group get hospitalised due covid. honestly probably trying stop people rioting...


*looks outside*


that worked great. january april 1000 died Sweden care homes covid. time period managed keep covid away residents 10000 died without covid. it? Seems fine Canada. way counted, co-morbidity, yes. sole cause death surpassed flu. Anyone died COVID virus us counted COVID death. Sorry - misread. totally agree Hmm. wonder 1918 Pandemic pretty much ended summer 1919. fewer crazies back then? really use talking reason, reddit LOVES hate fat people knew I'd regret interacting you. hope rest day bright are. astute observation. learning BMI, racial, genetic Vit status factors severity illness.

Pretending make snap judgment two pure ignorance callousness. Hundreds hundreds thousands people negatively affected EITHER choice assuming one obvious cruel naive. It'll increase. people think they're young affect them, people think god protect them, people tempted ""deals"" they'll find, people think *Well, opened safe*, etc, etc. people catch bring back home. :( would tie valuable equipment waste reagents testing everyone every two weeks. infinite supply testing products. stuff grow trees manufactured , purified , packaged etc. Test people need either symptoms work environments require like healthcare workers school teachers. culprit failure control spread, lack access medicine tens millions. disgusting want make individuals.

Ah is. fast. first sound warning heroic [Dr. Li tried sound warning late December. ignored persecuted, national hero even persecutors impunity. definitely ""on frontlines"". knowledge American 'intelligence' noted problem *after* initial efforts. Extended learning summer would better younger kids catch up. 

Among issues, proposing happened, current coming kindergarten classes would twice large twice many people would applying college entering workforce given year usual. (More would need enter workforce would locked college.)

Regardless, unless kids offered additional schooling behind forever. majority likely Um thousands people protesting masks try storm parliament building? way years. like matter pick, everyone sides still meets Bohemian Grove hi fives.

""we sure tricked fucks!"" amount collective domain knowledge we've already lost due deaths medical workers staggering, cannot fathom next generation face see fraction loss education professionals. 

A lifetime experience expertise something easily quickly replaced, especially already facing deficit. 

So many lives affected, immediate loss wonderful people trying steer towards better time, astounding scale interacted longer enjoy dedication passion. every teacher lost, many hundreds thousands lives affected? Children, teenagers, young adults, parents, friends, reverberations every death virus practically impossible imagine. idea reopen let COVID-19 run course falls apart even mildest scrutiny.

100% agreed. However, ""just stay closed country almost social support structures.""

That's whole point; obviously right answer we're weighing different sets values other. intentionally compare apples vs microwaves try gauge right answer. 

It's complete nightmare caused horrific lack societal support programs, what's front us. =/ considered canada? don’t know much separation powers, you? said. omitting. I'm giving context title like necessary. getting upset title downplay danger young people pretty tone deaf especially sub

That's said reasonable, misunderstood saying. dishonest, dishonest could say statement made true. several opportunities quote part video dishonest done so. know lot people watched interview. 


This known appeal popularity logical fallacy. discussing said, people think. knew masks unbelievable important basic medical knowledge everyone whole world point wearing them

You correct. Masks incredibly important combined measures regular hand washing social distancing. trump secured suitable supply masks received intelligence brief threat coronavirus November 19 may conversation. whole point interview ensure general public hoard masks desperately needed healthcare workers far higher risk general public. 

Unless quote something says video dishonest, seem unable do, think done.
edit: spelling know are, majority California still tier 1 lockdown. restaurant's outside seating pickup/ delivery only, gym's around (Bay area) closed.

The current issue weather lockdown ended soon, decision made. Right getting public participate safety measures priority.

It seems working, CA current positive rate 4%, 8%. seems indicate people actively involved protective routines. Pff that’s nothing , come Argentina , 50%. Don’t know you’re getting downvoted question. would hope rethink letting fans attend. it’s $$$ Maybe secretly dragon borne breath hot contained.

That may need swap medical mask designed less irritant One president change things need complete change bottom happened since 1776 rediculous 

It spelled ""ridiculous."" help remember ""I first ridicule myself."" Basically Canada closed we’re locked in. /s I'll half price tell happen half time. It’s math. It’s hard.

My mother (light) stroke April Covid panic. joke. high blood pressure. lives seniors building. 3 long term care facilites within 3 blocks building lots personal care workers ""sharing"" buildings, going one other.

When started see news stories LTC buildings shutting soon one person got postive, within weeks ended outbreaks rolling bodies stretchers, couldnt take it. flipping every day.

That went across country. many ""seniors homes horror stories"".

How think affects seniors already susceptable strokes heart attacks? people ones would care infected family killed them. might sound harsh give AF.  There’s “may have” tbh, it’s LA. virus likely every big city across globe officially announced 2020 Yeah, socially distanced, outdoor event people wearing masks...kinda like protests everybody seems fine  American way ignore problem, ignore lives think money. (Even though probably lost money half assed approach) Yes (from France). lucky. worst best either. alarm ringing 8 months. I’d argue it’s threat. Plus, many even go doctor, let alone care health, late? decent amount funny came Ethiopia U.S. required negative covid result within last 72 hours. Belgium, kid class tests positive, whole class gets quarantined home two weeks.

They get follow remote classes two weeks. I'm sorry think supporting argument - understand restating (as europe) average age infected trending downward compared start pandemic, part explained much better testing age groups (many missed first time round precisely need hospital treatment low).

Heads up. number add due pure r0. think China extremely well. obscure numbers. complete government public synergy. People companies taking hurting reduce long term effects. numbers stand virus see.

Edit. still got upvote me. think fair question.

Second edit. January 22nd May, restaurants allow costumers inside Shenzhen. left return Hong Kong June 2nd,most shops reopen reopened week two. still closed. probably 60 percent closed 40 percent open ratio. Tired herd ass, know fucking nothing voting bullshit.

It's September can't even get two cats home, frigging see building next one lived in, Sheung Shui Hong Kong. personally love full body checks forgot water bottle, really gets going. couldn’t get president tell people wear mask, even said downplayed knowing bad was! makes think precautions would taken? No. bad policy. prioritization behavioral effects. 

As much hate mouthing 'contra' talking point, sometimes government learn *not* act. 

Creating false sense security wasting thousands hours manpower efforts good policy. either shut travel, reengage TSA perform actual tests, invest actual ground troops: contact tracers. nobody gives shit teachers suddenly daycare jeopardy. know fact allowing fans sporting events. assume similarly curtailing large gatherings. Definitely, pretty sick tired people justifying death saying oh look they're obese! protects them, insenuates life less worth. ready approved two different things. We’re arguing semantics here, Covid seasonal flu 45 incredibly close terms death. Covid technically higher it’s much. practical purposes, it’s same.

The issue spreads way Rock hard place. federal government help small businesses this, either need open attempt survive close permanently.

That's balancing act states dealing right bad fed fucked up. always hope. Looks like R pretty stable moment good hopefully new measures least partially counteract increase R return Unis schools. job, screen every employee contractor comes in. found 0 symptoms even though 10 confirmed cases far. show. Surprisedpikachu.jpg Funny story. 2002 mom took trip Philadelphia.

Went COVID test reputable facility.

Their IR thermometer registered 97.8 F. Sweat probably cooled forehead dry desert air.

The actual Covid test came negative I’m fine serious fever undetectable non-contact thermometer.

*Great* screening process. Everybody passes, restriction trade! Hospitals actually relatively safe people directly treating Covid patients. Everyone wearing masks anyone symptoms isolated. I'm freaked assholes wearing mask chin standing foot behind supermarket.  Trump needs get balls end whole dam thing!!! I'm starting enter phase I'm caring less less social distancing well 😩. feels like goalpost contentiously moved. 

Like single people? supposed give dating indefinitely? enjoyed job food service. longer something relax enjoy meet people in. 

We designed ""social distance"" literally matter anyone says self righteous sub. northern hemisphere? awesome. Thanks sharing. Makes understanding sensitivity specificity much clear. agree you, done much anybody, but

""childish need social interaction"" funny way say ""fundamental human need connection"". Living username. ironic readers missed that. Ignorant westerners gonna western want make t-shirt last sentence it, big, bold letters. Fucking shit government never “screened” anyone. held thermometer near that. “Screening” happens every single restaurant Asia order fucking cup coffee. Good Happy recovered! risk teachers protected better yes. Children affected whole. Many European nations school fine stop brainwashed fearmongering doing. able protect vulnerable teachers (maybe young ones give full paid time off?). forcing kids 6 feet apart live inside bubbles literally insane given know virus actually serious we've led believe. right deaths, cases generally. I'm BC going 2nd bump cases (which coloured perceptions).

I realize overall Canada curve remained low since seeing news Ontario too. 

BC IQ -100 Ohhhh no, poor predators. 😭😭😭😭😭 psychological bandaid anyway. total time person spends incubating virus carrier, infected fought still shedding amount amount time spent fever probably 5% less.  

I caught flu someone tested positive doctors said weren’t contagious hadn’t fever certain number days. Ok... rarity.

It's like finding piece gold sewer... need assumption ""it's full gold"" true, actuality mostly poop.

I personally know people blame Democrats state economy health right don't.

I know people believe virus Democrat engineered ploy, don't... Mixed believing virus even real.


Let sink in... majority coworkers extended family believe Democrats killed hundreds thousands people around world try cheat election, via disease nobody gotten sick from...

People want believe want believe, they're good job of.

I'm still 85% convinced Trump going win November, either cheating, via valid victory... We're far making progress feels like planning tomorrow's dinner menu Titanic splitting two. also rarely exposed amount people prolonged periods time teacher would be.

Yeah, darn nurses work four- five-hour shifts go home watch Netflix post Facebook everyone else work. Trump's new expert Coronavirus x-ray guy, 0 education Infectious diseases. Twerpy likes he's anti mask herd immunity supporter. wondering reach immunity necessary immunity if
1. virus undetectable 3-4 months
2. People reinfected
3. Millions die

Twerpy removed Fauci control he'd say. tried muzzling him, giving script continued give us good scientific medical advice Twerpy like it. hanging bar right now, well...*you're fucking moron.*

I hate say it, bars need closed completely decent vaccine arrives. People careless enough even without alcohol involved. removal presidential term actually vote. sad. Schools shut Covid risks. Along hospitals, police fire departments, delivery services, food process plants, grocery stores, etc. Nobody exposed risk. Anyone else read ""Anger China Doctor died Covid-19""? Ding, ding, ding! Nail head, winner! stated previously dangerous relation exposed coronavirus. professions listed volunteered risk.

Lol Served 11 years Army. would never expect healthcare workers teachers subject fighting taliban. Since ya know don’t proper equipment, training, didn’t sign fight terrorists, etc... predicted success look like. People saying bad “we closed much” expected part successfully containing virus. estimates said 10,000 dead. 

When mask work looks like overreacted. we’re beating looks like much. That’s success looks like. 200,000 failure acceptations excuses. 

I wish country competent leadership protected countrymen instead pressing would “go away” one day. could less half deaths, people would still BBC saying “ masks devil himself” “it’s flu” would instead Trump brand losing. Biden, said explicitly would reject single-payer. 

I'll vote guy, guess, I'm fucking happy it. need fix locked-in 2-party FPTP system, top priority, imo. Death rates (per article)

Under 40: 0.01%

40-59: 0.12%

Over 60: 1.7% get pols, power money another level. teachers hang enjoy least social security. “White House ends useless Covid screenings” learning painful lesson last year, I’m getting flu shot next Thursday lol agree said.


I personally think price somebodies life though. issue nobody wants die cause someone else die. cost make sense let cases rise(assuming deaths follow) extent economy continue dig deeper.


Schools daycare essential. NEED open, matter cost. Phycological damage economic damage cause Covid19 schools daycares closed much high. know covid19 SARS, MERS, get schools rolling. anything that, optional, managed much possible keep cases low. response facts?

Didn't think so. add up? keep strict measures place hence number low. Guangdong shut 3 months, like one half months.

Literally opposite happens US. measures enforced reopen quickly, number still high even 6 months. go outside sure hell catch never walked field highschool without blood running arm leg. Open air doesnt matter youre smashing people blood/sweat/saliva everywhere. let science deniers run country... zero. Chronic complications flu exceedingly rare, especially vaccines.

Yet seeing heart inflammation otherwise asympto people. ACE2 present several organ systems. saying Uigurs *not* forced en masse ""re-education camps"", denied access relatives outside world, physically abused, forcibly sterilized, denied able participate religious cultural traditions, will?

If so, could prove **is** happening, would reverse stance publicly denounce CCP?

...

I thought not. anyone know properly re-use n95? used month ago. They’ve sitting sure use Well resorting personal attacks another sign dont arguments. obviously dont even understand PHA responsibility is.

Edit: fact insinuating Sweden Heard immunity strategy another proof victim propaganda. myth. half ass stay-at-home orders reopen quickly way Sweden it, restrictions all, work? would staying home reopening soon problem? problem America politics. election year, would barely bigger seasonal flu incident reports. Democrats willing put country hatred Trump, would also big issue. actually decided hatred Trump justification driving economy ground. main problem America. That's response avoided. exactly hoping for. Last March, pretty much extinguished flu, 2 months earlier normal. American colleges still look good international resume. Thx man, Vietnam imposed nationwide social distancing 300 mark local transmission April. Dalian city imposed lock 2 local transmission city. think social distancing 300 early all.

The purpose social distancing reduce transmission speed contact tracing, testing, upgrading hospitals able catch transmission speed. poorer less equipped country is, early strict lockdown benefit containment measures, provided actually well-planned. Beijing afford lockdown enforce social distancing throughout recent outbreak compared Dalian's rush lockdown 2 people mark Beijing lot well-equipped well-prepared compared Dalian. effects early aggressive actions catching transmission spread seen resurgences China, Vietnam, Malaysia, New Zealand, authorities 4 largely managed contain resurgent waves detecting first cases resurgent waves.

The problem lockdown India poorly planned didnt account poor socio-economic effects lockdown along preexisting issues community. people react socio-economic effects preexisting conditions make lockdown less effective be. dad flies lot work. bought Christmas last year, still go process/interview, loves it. Says one best gifts he's ever given. Yep, like abused wife saying, ""The 3 ladies street get beaten worse husbands get husband, I'm well, really!"". Many scenes latest season Westworld filmed Singapore. dad MRI scheduled 8:15 tomorrow morning. We’ve cancelled 7 times already put longer. I’m worried him. 

Not sure safe MRI right Statistical death, actually dead ""Frog"" slang white people order get radar ~~cucks~~ social justice warriors spreading word dangers chemtrails.

Also, Bill Gates paying install sprinklers top 5G towers spray air COVID. Makes sense. Thanks taking time explain. Hope everything works you. Exactly. Another US college already exponential spread, one week next. ***only*** way work closely monitoring spread. three-day ***max*** test-result turn around required there’s on-campus learning involving 18-21 year olds. still can't get many old politicians retire? Outstanding move president, again. Demand districts held standards put CDC. Mask wearing, adequate spacing, ventilation, etc... can’t done since school districts budgets online learning. 

You’re right professions put unnecessarily risky situations country failed provide adequate PPE. doesn’t make right profession especially one isn’t first responder. Like work shitty job also work shitty job weird mentality have. 

Those professions listed much stricter protocols PPE now. mention availability testing first responders. also rarely exposed amount people prolonged periods time teacher would be. Agreed. true. Wait, something this. ""I can't complain""

""yeah, bad""

""No no, *can't complain*"" safety. grateful. Chinese used — live rather unique society result tumultuous history. something changed willy-nilly. fuck, testing first place Chinese spread around world could blocked. There’s always Canada, sick won’t bankrupt you. knew November, nothing end March.

Got it. Responding seem level-headed willing think things lot people struggling economically country supposedly resources country world.

Unfortunately, struggling appears human condition. like countries created utopias America left behind. Every country developed world people struggling economically. developing world, billions still face grinding poverty. mean can't get better (and indeed, things much better even 50 years ago), think frustration continued existence poverty going get worse things like automation AI continue emerge evolve economy.

I share pessimism. Technological advancements raised living standards, lowered them. see particular reason change could four things right now, would be:  Universal Basic Income, supported Value-Added Tax redirection funds existing programs. program essentially pay itself, simply take funds available distribute evenly/accordingly.

The math work. liked Yang's ideas, implement even modest UBI pushed for, would need politically impossible things like gut social security. can't tell person living $1,500 per month (the average payment US) paying social security entire life they're going receive $1,000 need pay $1,000 able-bodied 22-year old. could argue fairness (I really see argument even worthy consideration fairness perspective, willing hear people out), politically non-starter waste time even mention.

If make UBI work VAT politically feasible cuts, go it, think math failed war drugs. Decriminalize usage drugs, make sale marijuana legal institute federal tax it. Legalize medical usage substances used treatment mental health disorders, according efficacy tested medical science research. Use part funds tax marijuana support addiction treatment safe-usage centers. Begin treating drug addiction mental health issue rather criminal issue.

Can't disagree this. think impact overstated think many people prison simply (rather dealing) drugs, worth tutition-free, national university, similar Open University UK. Lean heavily online courses, allow in-person testing centers, make accredited institution. Pay remainder marijuana tax revenue.

This fantastic idea. Unfortunately country currently moving away standardized testing, would need make system credible. yes, national standardized tests based national online university, could supplant much accreditation function colleges currently serve hamfisted way. Without testing, basically University national health care. Divert funds companies currently paying health insurance tax cover it. companies this, they'll start (with limitations small/local businesses). Redirect funding Medicaid/Medicare pay well.

That's clumsy way pay healthcare. fine say taxes increase pay kind universal care many individuals see offsets reductions costs currently paying, tax increase need broad-based that. Again, make math work. EU believes Starting think wildfires karma America shit Like others said, parents work. also COVID far dangerous teachers (especially old ones) compared small children. r/nottheonion Bravo, good calling guy out.

COVID causes comorbidities lead death, organ damage, limb loss, neurological damage, etc. shot bullet. bullet isn’t cause death, blood loss damage inflicted puncture. Covid attacks cardiovascular neurological systems, notably endothelial cells, lead whole slew problems. Evidence mounting long term problems COVID causing continues mount. And, really matter got students? Either way could’ve infected people system, including students. Or, could contracted ventilation system, know date school units /s. Studies also shown infectious particles thrust air toilet plumes public toilets. There’s reason almost every flu season school systems shut flu outbreak virus happens infectious flu. People lie time.

Cohort care already introduced case suspicion bringing extra night staff intended patient. homes quarantined ward apartments immediately another ward (somatics) know several infected even then. wards, staff encouraged residents social distancing [physical distancing] dining table well living rooms. Residents also stuck wards hung there. residents go walks, etc., special routines exit take avoid several personal meetings. clear all. least me. slow. would please point exactly countries got right, get right, violate civil liberties Americans hold dear. eagerly await response. 2/3 people wore mask 2/3rds effective (a bandana gets close this) could go zero community spread 4 weeks.

We could done October...

We could've actually locked country 10 days done April even started instead kicking economy people's lives curb half measure.

But instead become polarized issue mildly inconvenienced order save peers economy.

We've proven, escalating degree, there's intention acting best interest whole long individual feel empowered acting group. /r/FloridaMan refuses contact traced India: hold wine I'm very, frustrated states US complete idiots letting ton people dine indoors.

But also agree point question whether close indoors mid-2021, occasionally going *some* activities pre-COVID. Like dining indoors blue moon.

It's kinda inevitable also necessarily sign unbelievable selfishness people want eat out. problem responsibly / wearing mask much possible getting drunk so.

And yeah, hoping enough keep restaurants alive.  country's demise going bipartisan system. Democrats stupid Republicans stupid mudsling see make side dirtier. Biden ignorant Trump. Yet, risk getting infected remains extremely high. responsibility get likely pass others, pass others, eventually someone gets lifelong health problems dies behavior. also recent, concerning information widespread heart damage damage organs, can't begin know long-term implications. also proof people become reinfected reinfection worse initial infection. Still dangerous cavalier make difference. like this. - literally take away, well maybe lead healthier life style.

What mean people like me? literally master spin thread I'd love know it'll happen. Like best guess. know I'd stuck isolating next May, would helpful information invest resources choose activities (for instance, making larger investments home comforts entertainment). I'd love said, likely case scenario get vaccine _______.  exact reason stayed home idiot whole time. Giving science/doctor's time find virus. mean would rather gotten February now?

Thank you. Ya think? 

What earth made anyone think ok endless streams people indoor location masks we've known Chinese research since February incredibly easy spread settings? hot take completely wholly unsupported by, well, anything all, EC's job literally make popular vote irrelevant prevent uneducated majority forcefully voting famous/popular people.

There effectively zero chance candidate lose popular vote margin Trump currently trails Biden still win Electoral College. controversial opinion; statistical reality. trying dispute that, simply clue talking lead polls literally due increase support high population density areas covid surging (which already saturated support).

I'm sure whether wrong, plain stupid. Yes, Biden's lead largely due high levels support population centers. also true Obama's leads 2008 2012 largely due high levels support population centers. That's kind of, um, Democrats win elections; disproportionate support cities overcomes disproportionate support Republicans rural areas.

So definitely stupid, also wrong, seem implying swamping Trump states like California New York creating mirage Biden's lead reality he's trailing battlegrounds. flatly incorrect. is, fact, *why* wrong EC; California pretty big, still posting 8 point national lead without well battleground states. Biden consistently led every major battleground state. Right plainly favored win PA, MI, WI, would enough hand Biden election assuming wins every state Clinton 2016. He's also ahead Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, competitive states red Georgia, Texas, Iowa. wide open path 270 EC votes. Trump extremely narrow Say want, good chuck African-American demographic (not majority) still favor Trump.

Sure: I'll say Trump racist, 8 percent black vote 2016 win share November. Turns GOP fan-fic aside, black voters huge fans avowed leads polls cause effect winning EC.

Again, idea talking about. Biden wins popular vote ≥5 points, wins EC. problem night game. NFL needs ban night games pandemic UV levels none less. US citizen people parts world: please help :( it’s really depressing seems oddly specific dangerous. Sorry r/coronavirus looks like Covid-19 acts like every coronavirus know of.

I'm endangering anyone. show sources prove FL fudging numbers? (Firing stalker lunatic data scientist proof they’re fudging numbers)


What said MICHIGAN’S numbers may ones inaccurate inflated death numbers, would make conspiracy theorist? what’s make you?

 
Cuomo inflated states deaths sending elderly covid back nursing homes, creating quite mess. 

NY zero federal support? make shit up? see field hospital built? see giant hospital ship docked? That’s federal help get hospitals...

Here’s  remember guys bs 6% CDC story. low 80-100 million Americans pre-existing conditions put 94% bunch died today.  Yes, kid online school right teacher classroom. Studies schools countries state risk - least elementary levels - came staff staff transmission student staff student student. flew Dallas days ago, arrived via Tokyo. screening, good news nobody really wants come USA anyway. lines customs! soon crossed domestic side though, whoa dude... it’s nothing happening. Everybody brother flying again. wife spend 30 grand year sending daughter daycare. make good money afford to, people working hourly blue collar jobs? Even cheapest day care could total take home wages one person entire year.  Oppression forced lack self worth appropriately putting it, yes, sadness real. many yearbooks going ""In Memoriam"" section school year. Yuuuuuuupppp. 

I've already lost 1/4 lymph nodes cancer. I'm reluctant gift wrap heart lungs Coronavirus. fucker better prepared work it. No. mean... Duh? Reopening *literally anything* cause virus spread more. it’s not, it’s based previous 14 days. UK national resident Thailand example would eligible entry long weren’t schengen area previous 14 days Right, pandemic jobs risk stock market dropped 10k points Fed pumped money artificially inflate it.

Thanks sage advice. (not neighbouring ones tho). Look excess deaths. Go 20 minute run mask get back me. Sports banned wearing mask huge issue. read, evidence Vitamin supplements actually work shaky non-existent. safe. try get safe, moderate sun exposure much winter live. niece eating whole lot right anyway. Mostly lying bed groaning struggling attend virtual class get homework done, understand. *Investigating might confused Johan Giesecke.

You completely right. Many football players retire relatively young due nature sport. money boredom may drive back it. evidence this... People still practicing social distancing. strategy long-term, expected happen without herd immunity. Herd immunity never strategy. Stay safe. Terrible confusing headline. 'by 2,919 day', 'by nearly 3,000 day', mess. Even bigger pro tip: don’t check bag. plane airport &lt;15 min. It’s correlation. cause. Recently revealed related hypertension / inflammation cardiovascular system I’m sooo glad chose kids. coworkers family kids pulling hair trying balance everything. know use google? Saying economy baffles me. case, earth would decide kill 5000 people? area - lot. Context help fuel fear. Considering got virus school started, I'm sure sending kids back school anything death, headline fits actual situation. I'd feel better used it. Instead throw everything trash go landfill. I'm concerned getting vaccine time available me. I'm least risk category likely able get 6+ months. Ironic seeing West primitive degenerate culture planet. Social regression art West mastered. disaster humanity exported planet generations though. Thank you! luckily got hold 2. friend mine extra kind enough give Sorry, that’s accurate. evolving situation. People complain goal posts moved don’t understand part effective strategy learning applying learn. published goals state county visualizations track them. argument never “let’s see open let hospitals fill covid patients long don’t overflow”. problem virus quickly get ahead whatever interventions put place. get spot like NY, FL, TX, AZ, don’t many options left. states control, returned increasing hospitalizations it’s fine line control control terms current interventions play. take measured approach loosening restrictions don’t, time see surges, you’ve got 2-4 weeks exponential growth deal with. mechanics know true.  leaders clear fact learn more, approach change. don’t people jump “moving goalposts ...it’s fair argument”. isn’t football game can’t change rules mid flight. pandemic don’t fully know dealing yet. zero spread Covid since re-opened three months ago

It impossible know true   im guessing kind happen time, within years. Fast food first withing 5-10 years im guessing. Truck driving really close behind maybe even. doctors within next 20 far between. Still needed robots work. think people gonna go work farms? truckers suddenly jobs, think person would go work. skills driving truck mostly. (not saying hes dumb anything, specifically skilled). call center? fast food? nope going away. wont driving uber cause eventually gone too. Maybe construction/road work stuff. support jobs needed. UBI real need sooner later. People need think life is. get UBI want better life basic life, need creative. Make stuff, build stuff. Etsy type supplements. future generations trained new world industries, whatever are) Yeah sometimes it’s okay spare expense, especially life depends it.   LOL @ ""I miss friends."" Pretty soon ""mom"" ""teacher."" downvoted? people obsessed masks? realize reopen sports earlier it’s safe without causing stir? People dumb Others' wrongdoing absolve responsibility. 🤦‍♂️ tho Pretty sure shaming kinds bad. Europe's death rate probably lower comprised bunch individualistic critically thinking impaired people want want can't bothered, words clear guidance leadership failing healthcare system. way life also vastly different since Americans work live, individualism natural consequence that. However yes, I'm sure obesity plays role, probably much smaller suggesting though considering highest numbers 65 wherein obesity big factor. Well problem it’s idea takes coronavirus seriously helps slow spread, know Trump doesn’t want There's lot people literally zero scientific bioethical training. Forget bioethics 101, lot people need ""Baby's First Clinical Trial."" ask, wanna know... lot countries that, lot Roughly 80 million international tourists year think might idiot parents don’t really want parent raise kids. kids something bring fulfillment sense responsibility lives. Yeah, I'm fine that. go would benefit immediately. 100%.

The government opens pubs, gyms, schools gives everyone free money spend restaurants surprised there's increase cases young people.

Not mention young adults 18-25 far likely working customer facing jobs (retail, bars etc.) longer furlough, increases likelihood infection. people really think makes US look better? Europe difficulty keeping cases US definitely can't another spike inevitable. I'm train saying need reopen, also need adapt situation increase health safety. includes promoting healthy habits using masks. Let herd immunity happen, control rate severity it.

I see risk analysis. Occurrence, detection, severity. Detection shit due faulty tests. Occurrence lowered much without causing depression; wearing masks cleaning mitigations needed here. Severity tackle it, afformentioned healthy habits mask wearing lower impact symptoms. don’t want Debbie Downer it’s really good news - it’s neutral best patient. 1 5000 incidence TM well beyond reasonable threshold acceptable side effects confirmed ruled likely due vaccine either kill severely delay vaccine. Another bad thing TM often difficult figure caused means investigation end taking long time. silver lining looks like TM diagnosis hasn’t actually confirmed yet. need hope turns patient, like first patient, doesn’t actually transverse myelitis. Okay anti-vax anti-science, driven political bias. dangerous way live. forgot one spoken trump, guess “whistleblowers”, anonymous sources, books fake then. Even upcoming book Trump fake lol.

And capitalist company would risk billions dollars manufacturing, labor, production Trump might tweet something mean. don’t know much science economics, maybe best thing stay isolated everyone else, including internet too, safe. Long term years. weeks. shoot general, recommended reuse them. article alternative can't afford new ones. understand tested Question is, going states!? Oh, got me, checked took longer I'd like admit get it. Thanks laugh!! Show said that. brainwashed murikkkans refuse believe facts Ohhhh hypothermia eh? I’ve screened similar numbers, July. lowest date 33.8 Celsius (92.8 Fahrenheit guys south border). Granted threshold 37.8 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) recommended 37.3 (99 Fahrenheit) since low grade fever indicative cases present fever symptom. must it! praying hard enough. Pray harder dammit! also even transverse myelitis; STAT reporting unrelated multiple sclerosis. really want trump office, biden senile, don’t know do. Guess we’re fucked never know strain going get since multiple ones come season shot one. kind, turn I'm glad shown example empathy human decency towards struggle. yeah, tested vaccine 5 10 years am, masks enforced schools, enforced retail last month so. We've lucky cases almost zero here, understand concern places that's case. certain individuals, autoimmune reaction triggered vaccination. Flu vaccine really commonly associated transverse myelitis, GBS (likely rate 1-2 cases per million vaccinations). Can't speak heritability that, though -- that's beyond scope knowledge. “You OPP?” Indeed. never removed bullshit airport security either. No, don't, really, truly don't. TSA reviewing that. least flew last year something could skip assuming shoes didn’t trip sensors.

The good/bad they’re trying make screening less predictable apparently. elected leadership 2018 authority investigate criminal Presidency. Could imagine Woodward's tapes entered public record months ago House impeachment hearings?

Unfortunately, Speaker completely without choice here. Crazy utterly powerless insignificant position Speaker Nancy Pelosi. would someone 40k bank? Spend invest it. (like TSA)

Shots fired, rightfully so. someone Alabama made comment, would downvoted oblivion. funny Eurotrash get pass irresponsible shitheads blatantly obvious sign administration extremely happy things going. They've following plans months now, definition success. sick horrifying but, yeah, blatantly obvious they're happy numbers dead way things going US. :( know single person 20s like adhere rules least even respect others. government forcing stupid actions favour economy problem  Weird number death relatively low certainly be. know! That’s passing grade FSU ! /s hoping Sweden go back up, Norway come back down? arguments. fanboy Fauci thinks god. Really hate Reddit hivemind taking everything Fauci said truth without critical thinking. CEO he's also physician/scientist ideally understanding company's products. half! here's something needs attention.  need start conversation alternatives. Life stop, need learn adapt. anyone dosed trial even exposed virus...because possible phase 3 candidate exposed. Exactly. I’d way fucking concerned winter vaccine candidates already. huge break contained locking down.

Florida fudging numbers, months. kind silly compare drivng COVID. One drives inherent risk. COVID going forever prolong take precautions. South Korea got hit time did. set massive testing social distancing. right away though. 400 deaths. Almost 200,000 souls perished. way. sincerely hope fare well get hit this. work medical field seen young people symptoms infect loved ones die. careful.and make sure endangering others least. death numbers still pretty low based number cases. guess lower average age? Knowing interest medical industrial complex

That’s interesting way characterize greater need medical professionals PPE. Also people less likely seek treatment know system clogged covid patients. 100% mean, old normal eventually come back lol. think first pandemic human history??

But yeah, might take good West Chester....PA. (my Alma Mater!) Better mask. think it’s good compromise. Colonial-brained westerners idea (or appreciation) massive expansive cities South America Spanish came destroyed everything. massive ancient cities buried beneath jungle. Except fact MUZZLED MASKS!!! kidding. Wear mask please. literally let guard hour one best friends hair makeup got it,” Michaels said. “It’s simple. 

Wtf going gym? need medical attention. eating food watch get prepared. study assumed essentially 50% population rally would get it

Where assume that? I'm familiar modeling technique (I forget called) sounds like core association number Sturgis participants various US counties change number cases counties course month. read 40+ pages detail honestly see suggest 50 percent rally got Sturgis ""study"" prime example really sloppy science

Economists real scientists anyway. remember ever problem either, I'm sure flight attendants perfectly fine people use power they're given try dominate others, conceive follow anything everything told flight attendant. feel right told put pet knew based seeking information previously, I'd rather us plane.

For incident video, opinion could barely understand anything, I've heard conflicting things entirely make sense led it. think major concern enough time athletes qualify it. peepee_video_realfinal6.mp4 covid whole damn life cmon wish they’d close schools. schools already shit show. Maybe rushed hell first kind, virus 0.63% fatality rate?

Look, I'm anti-vaxxer. shots, way trust one. I'll holding while. that...?? article click bait driving agenda.  Im without agenda.  

The virus real... bad... use common sense combat it. 

Stop listening politicians (both sides). Think yourself.  

If vaccine comes out... 75% effective (which unlikely, even Fauci said 50% likely) half US population take it... partially protects... what, 25% 40% population. 

Then produce vaccine distribute it... we're looking 3 4 years. Kids can't stay school long.

If intellectual nonpartisan, realize there's lots valid solutions.  close open.... stop buying they're selling.... sheep Let’s say accept characterization shift advice “non-medical professionals without vulnerabilities need mask” “everyone mask” flip-flopping. (I disagree, never mind that.) point examples flip-flopping beyond point? Technically hypertension getting worse, shitty diets lack exercise getting worse. lead hypertension like getting stabbed leads bleeding, can't cite bleeding risk factor. Feed couple dog, too, it! blame emergency vet bill.  Death us! Here's good summary early misteps outright disinformation Gizmodo.   Question lets say ur whole family gets covid still help everyone house mask get viral load? that's nuts. yet another careless governor students behave behave, universities must bear responsibility. It’s vast psychology departments cannot forecast teenage behavior. related note, rush go back normal minimize harm economy, people, especially first responders, [unnecessarily harmful pollutants around Ground Zero. devastating health effects exposure pollutants caused many deaths years attacks NYC day. lot deaths horribly dragged years suffering... mean exercising freedom choosing wear one, take freedom away.

If choice wear one, forced to, freedom taken away.

I think bit confused. Man....the balls guys eh?  imagine hit brand stock would take vaccine found harmful rushed due political motivations  Important remember cases weren’t *at* wedding rather wedding started chain reaction. defense anything—just clarification. Rona's coming balls, boys. Ayo reddit found bot , takem 😎  Trump fire him? Sure Jan  percentage Swedes cloth face coverings stores buses? Sure Jan keeps going on. Covid may well become endemic, even vaccine. what? Maybe masked, distanced, socially barren, culturally impoverished life “workable” you. isn’t me.

And wasn’t talking “knowingly” showing infectious disease. Obviously would shitty thing do. said inadvertently. caught Covid someone didn’t know it, would hold responsible, much less call murderer. that’s kind “logic” people using today.

Also: Covid Spanish flu. average age Covid death 28 rather 80, would view risk differently. may call ageist, see natural order things. want young people shot full life, opportunities youth. don’t want miss sake. Obvious cause obvious effect. news channel 11. hard imagine able hide tragedy scale completely unchecked COVID-19 epidemic.

Why think that?   Bahaha, reddit one giant cumguzzling extravaganza. bigger blacker better! Agree totally. Like said another comment, nearly identical SARS... everyone knew wear masks then. countries it. US?

I really find Fauci's ""you understood made recommendation based product shortage"" really condescending... sorry assumed primary concern HEALTH product shortages nothing American people hoarding them?

That China. hospitals allowing staff use limited amounts have. Apparently sitting boxes somewhere nobody allowed take? think said one way another everyone already know airborne? highly spreadable contagious virus airborne water wet we're infected. knew airborne February, nothing. imported cases Korean CDC: Americas, EU, zero China Korea never travel ban country, imported cases representative sample disease prevalence.

The article linked regarding EU 3 months ago too. alumnus, embarrassing. Nah really ""We know now"" .

We always knew. Go back 60 minutes interview, Fauci knew Korea Japan success containing it, knew part reason widespread mask use. 

For whatever reason misled public given opportunity set standard. 

Why reddit give guy much credit? Fauci one step behind science. Get real epidemiologist spokesperson. Dr. Bix. Anyone. Fauci grandstanding fame seeker. chance lost credibility. done win back? switched jobs avoid layoff company. New job new company. keep trying find offshore talent do. can’t. do, I’ll job. depression US deciding offshore workers 1/5 1/10 current US wages “good enough”, US wages fall midpoint level ours.  Instead making 150,000, make 50,000 75,000.  wife’s company already made decision. 2 employees office 20, rest offshore working remotely.  I'd still appreciate he'd give new info every then. thing I've really seen past 2 3 months preaching great masks work. would 10x times scarier never pandemics like before. 97% people vitamin sufficient require ICU!
.Study came ppl!

Take vitamin D! Well, issues:

Moderna hasn’t even finished Pfizer candidate needs stored -94 playing sports would want mask valve? worry air going sides mask due heavy breathing. staggering me. hope time next week rest easy didn’t catch anything. idea incredibly dumb, amount time wasted moving everyone around often... Totally stupid! imagine disrupting too, even learn anything 12-14 increments?! mandatory testing students. hospitalizations yet. deaths. Rhinovirus influenza too, mean significant. y’all even bother go back forth people, don’t understand facts logic. can’t reason them, they’re worth time cool going start bringing people charges negligent homocide? 1 0.00001% chance impossible Exactly. Thank That's tough. I'm Utah they've got free testing state.

For end got super dizzy nauseated. eventually ask doctor something prescribed Zofran autoimmune diseases, prescribed steroid. said covid puts immune system overdrive, since mine already regular, steroid would help immune system calm stop reacting. dizziness. Mainly function long two weeks up. driving, bending load dishwasher, picking 18 month old. Luckily husband get sick tail end, we've always capable adult. He's day seven right keeps needing naps, irritating cough. Utah we've got lot smoke fires too, helping. he's got immune system horse never takes day work. He's needing multiple naps day, already taken three days work (working home.) tried ha half day, said brain focus muscles hurt sitting desk. crazy disease hitting two people different ways.   though make money, to.

They reason paid got COVID payroll loan. paying people pocket. CHILDHOOD CENTER INC non-profit organization located Greensboro, North Carolina received Coronavirus-related PPP case know PPP Loan Paycheck Protection Program loan designed provide direct incentive small businesses keep workers think 2021 Summer Olympics happen, get scrapped altogether 2024? trajectory pandemic suggests might developed counties early part next year, seems unlikely smaller underdeveloped counties fully vaccinated. think it’s possible you, incredibly, fail see cavernous hole reasoning.

Correlation equal causation. can’t imagine large events getting cancelled back-to-back years. That’d lightning strike gut punch. Hmmmm open shutdown still get increase covid cases. Suprise. Move slowed spread time get back work. hypothesized nose could provide pathway brain, authors wrote needed validated study.

but hell, needs information billionaires losing N E Edgy. high school art class start? Don’t late! know, right? I've reading headlines summer well NYC covid-wise, realize new Yorkers havent really eating indoors restaurants. You’re loser.  mom works cancer branch it’s cool seeing company make impact ..... decisions made regards risk assessment.

I’m scared 70% effective vaccine distributed .... still see case counts governments shut again. I’m afraid staying state virus “eradicated” .... even though there’s slim chance virus ever completely eradicated.

To summarize : agree. really hope able find solutions return normal. also hope threshold governments need ease restrictions isn’t 100% eradication .... else we’re lockdown forever They're desperate sell newspapers least Western society don't. know expected kind messaging work... drive everyone's fear communism turning us China (which, me, nowhere near scary Trump's blatant fascism, idea totalitarian government general scary.)

If going solve ""American"" way, would weaponized masks. Made war corona. ""We let enemy win!""

Sometimes feel like media know audience.  see someone die exposure virus continue argue favour exposing even people even higher levels virus? see blatantly murderous is? It’s late I’m tired, I’m going hunt paper. study 7000 people that’s linked lower COVID-19 cases wearing masks/face coverings public spaces. difficult remember nuance findings, yet recommend looking same. Wow sucks 8 people comparison 150-200 good ol days.

Everyone using face mask

Coaches cleaning everything every 20 minutes.

It surreal experience.

I feel sorry gym owner tbh... beautiful gym 8 people... think swimmers exempt. need wear mask times.... common sense Oooooooh, baby, know that's worth? sure got downvote boner on, I’m merely making observation. 

The article doesn’t specify, however, they’re testing everyone (not symptomatic) there’s 21 percent positivity rate, means people getting virus without severe illness asymptomatic, good news.

Not exactly sure think I’m “anti-science” much wish colleges weren’t open, that’s comment on. able mod amount US posts added? There's specific page US specific news, whilst understand there's tag here, there's much never hear anything countries.

Has issue addressed yet? generously giving Darwin Awards head start. Think statement minute. doesn’t give anyone anything aim for. gives reason take seriously, Science Jesus save soon. wrong. current outbreak import. Chill communist. Muh freedom guess school boards administrators wanted put minds ease making things look better.

I even think much thought went it. Schools could apply check government, did, added school's budget year. Swedish model kills seniors disproportionately, work. know “learning losses” ***already*** enormous economic impact US? 

Half century underfunding public schools, particularly “sunbelt”, “heartland” rural schools. taken 5% spent outlandish military weapons development since 60s invested public schools, perhaps citizens wouldn’t easily misled 😣  WTF? country teachers fighting want government resume scholar year ASAP, protesting streets, going strikes... contrast keep saying honest apparently that’s offensive you. think disagree point article fine unwarranted. covid glad got past 50 ...or not, depends point view So... Weird fact... chorus exactly 20 seconds long. exact amount time washing hands. I've singing star MONTHS time myself. enjoyable singing ABCs twice. think people smash mouth killed. ruined timing song. sprinting mask likely dangerous health covid  Teachers state allowed go strike. required go arbitration arrested. Correct. even example, would written ""Washington state"" one differentiating state DC. Thanks, actually pay NYT? REALLY?! see coming?! Again, many people experiencing this? everyone recovered this. government taking measures. going enter state contingency 15 September. idea works, squeezing thumb suppresses gag reflex quite lot. Left thumb left palm tighten fist. Obviously cause much pain, definitely move wrist (It break thumb), put much pressure can. 

I know works better two hands, guess matter using one hand swab anyway. major failing. 
Honestly, want fault Fauci it, can’t certain didn’t make bad decision going administration order keep voice heard. 
Anyone followed China saw virus (and knows anything respiratory viruses general) knew masks effective mitigation method. lot public sector unions gelded regulations limiting right labor actions. Tons states ban strikes...like, can't strike, that's union. Nevermind, test results came... NEGATIVE!!! police strike make work, teachers. hybrid NJ Parents town still complaining person full days. Day 2 saying kids aren’t getting enough work. Day 2!?!? Bold call others morons. obviously sides ""stay fuck indoors much humanly possible"" ""don't wear masks"". Plenty people go fun socialize taking precautions like wearing masks. Welcome scientific method! hypothesis proven wrong change hypothesis right. case masks 100% right answer. guys actually trying say think America handle ? Fun fact, game turned everything right want live past 80. cheat years allowed. letting virus roll population better results cases/million deaths/million restrictions? 

Ok, take true, know, people must taken personal health cautious level countries forced. 

Otherwise makes sense ever. else could lockdowns cause higher infection rate? things equal, someone tell imposing distancing mask wearing mandates end outbreak? 

Perhaps they're speaking rate positive tests. case, taking total infections spreading 8 months compared 4 months. end result would wash Healthcare perspective unless hospitals overrun. disagree yo8 buddy stay 6 feet away love stupid narcissistic people try rationalize poisonous short sighted ideals like they're kind romantic outlaw, come take *man* peg

Rather actually are, ignorant full grown adult throwing tantrum like child, like mildly inconvenienced even literally protection guess Might forever virus two week incubation period exposed two days ago could take two weeks symptoms show, could asymtomatic. Two days enough viral load become high enough testing Hey stalker. 

I’m expert know enough understand comes non-respirator masks matters size droplets carry virus virus since common method SARS-CoV-2 transmission respiratory droplets. 

Since there’s still medical respirator masks ideal prevention, surgical non-woven cloth masks next best thing reducing transmission. 

And since there’s also [Mounting also transmit aerosolized particles, mask-wearing *has paired** preventive methods like social distancing, prioritizing outdoor-only activities household avoiding indoor environments, especially small spaces ones bad ventilation. 

And imagine actual expert tell would listen.  Asking german teacher - nation job associated high social prestige, basically highest job security medical benefits, allows financially support family 4 kids wife staying home (just renting though)... different us? argument someone tries rationalizing young person thinks ok go he/she lazy give darn social distancing, masks responsible behavior? Well, like ready Thursday shipping. 
So takes year manufacture thats 8000/365 22 planes per day.
Hardly worth article initial comments didn’t look completely line. 
Looking post history / subs frequent, perhaps bad assumption part. 
I think right - trolling / repeating crap often see camp. better count days deaths trial. “The positive cases among students living on- off-campus increased exponentially since surge reported one week ago -- 64 440”

Exponential spread ... that’s good. Let guess: SDSU party school? 

The problem known “party schools” pandemic students choose attend tend partiers. college uni, party schools never allowed on-campus learning. Administrators schools chose allow held accountable forthcoming civil suits. Reuters:

Enjoy McArtisanal Burger thinking loud density known factor viral spread. Since seems Europeans long vacations take summer summer, took Europe (rather US destinations, India, Far East, South America, places farther afield). 

As result, Europeans ended staying EU, crowded locations (eg Spain, Portugal, France, Greece) virus spread came home vacationers? It’s shocking people aren’t taking seriously virus downplayed beginning. Mines expensive remote hybrid depending choose. one required person. 
My district smart though too, care kids teachers union cares. Yeah people brain already knew shit.  segue zombies '21? Ugh.. Sometimes feel like reddit sites (especially anonymous ones) like huge contest rudest person. I'm referring guy responded to, you. Multiple countries exceptions travel ban family members partners, including Denmark, SAS flies EWR. person US citizen partner residing Denmark, allowed conditions (declaration, testing). person commented isn’t partner figured I’d mention allowed in:) That’s 1 100

No, 1% 1 100. That's percent means. Per cent, per hundred.

.01% 1 10,000. one Sweden says vindicated. Times even naming alleged person said that. NZ really eradicated virus strict lockdown right? declared June won! It’s grim it’s far, far beyond. Countries like Mexico idea many died Covid.  comparison, [Hong Kong 50 years ago killed 4 million, much lower global population. Dumb Americans shouting MUH FREEDOM re: masks.

Meanwhile free go night club bar. can't visit family hospital. can't go beach. can't comfortably fly plane. get invasive testing done seeing family. can't visit dying relatives countries.

Meanwhile, countries enjoying freedoms sucked wore masks months social distanced.

But MURICA better mask-free banned leaving country wear mask go back normal life. sure. Outdoor stadium definitely helps too. I'm sure work fine /s  That's deceiving stat - one would argue US one desired inmigrant destinations, middle pack foreign-born population. 

So inmigrant's Mecca people like make - much less current regressive regime significant number *Americans* trying move - mostly peer nations *demonstrably* better living standards all-around. 

[Dozens Countries Take Immigrants Per Capita think United States every immigrant's dream, reconsider.

Unfortunately, saying grand conspiracy everyone conspiring together, it’s best argument. Similar claim US controls EU now, it’s baseless claim facts, likely serves claim fit argument making now, rather true beliefs. I’d love see examples, EU isn’t fond Trump, give leverage power?

Designing fact-less claim fit argument, rather beliefs, good look man. someone said scientists around globe coming together use climate change way influence geopolitical policies, would call crazy? sudden global conspiracy regarding vaccine development. let’s honest, it’s don’t like president, willing say, maybe even believe, anything lead defeat November. Remember horror Michelle Obama wanting country eat healthy?? also left 200K dead people. Oh, no, son. obvious close mark hit. pleased triggered enough can't let go, either.

Let's see 401k first. still time google fake one work.

Low effort. Low energy. Sad. Europe shows alternatives didnt work well either? widely distributed vaccine September? Ah right, already September. take early 2021 guaranteed vaccine! vaccinate everyone early 2021!! not? knows, maybe continue 2022, two years hard lockdown shouldnt prob NZ right? owe apology POTUS? Every time think reached bottom find way go deeper. 
Imagine history books depict 4-8 years much damage one moron do. Well said. Nothing 100% safe, that's news. People anger issues drug addiction higher risk dying virus way obese people are. they're worth less shaming. observation. 28 year old teacher looks like someone approaching 40, someone 20s response original surprised. China first country test virus implementee lockdown, hence got control quickly. US suppressed testing late, real lockdown measures put place. That's lead world cases deaths Well said. virus floating around 4 months without anyone even noticing. Tell lockdowns needed. Never seen before, always thought vaccines administered injection. Interesting. Anti-maskers vs Wokeism. I'm sitting sidelines box popcorn. Sure, useful TSA Sanitizing almost irrelevant. want talk ""virtue signaling,"" wiping tables sanitizing. Surface contact major vector.

Maybe COVID19, infectious diseases. Reducing influenza vectors important right well.  Science damn you! Meh, prefer pay things want directly rather jumping hoops consumer reward scheme. Namibia negative test 72 hours departure. stay one place five days you’ll tested day five. positive taken government facility. many asymptomatic? Also morbidly obese. sure thats ignored. Prepare how? Buy everyone bike tell eat veggies? So, they've gone game Sam Darnold throws six interceptions, game throws ""only"" four interceptions. 

I guess that's improvement. comparing TSA covid, comparing TSA covid 'screenings' examples security theater done response crisis. things make us *feel* safer actually improve safety much all. Seems like apt comparison. lot us partners USA. possibility stay 14 days Mexico another country banned flying US (but it’s option everyone). time arbitrary? get 10 seconds someone coughs face. numerous reports affected athletes reasonably healthy looking individuals.

I’m disputing people died narrow category though people affected quite significantly outside old, overweight, diabetes, etc...

This virus want “take chin”. Yes, likely fine you’ve taking care otherwise healthy. also might be. Quality safety precautions followed discipline. reason would quite wise us practice case see pandemic kills healthy people similar infection rate covid. Turn news It’s second article day involving young teachers dying. things common obese, caught even returning school. Please tell headline isn’t “Obese 34 year old Obese 28 year old die coronavirus”? It’s extremely disingenuous acting like g healthy teachers caught teaching. media making like bandits due pandemic it’s disgusting. what? I'm sure Miami University anything party Ohio, school even opened yet. higher-education lobbyists estimated colleges would need least $74 billion federal government renovate campuses ensure student safety.

I’m shocked, shocked lobbyists said needed much federal money “renovate safely.”  Next thing bet you’re going tell there’s gambling campus. vaccine everyone want Christmas. Care list viruses we've eradicated? Spider alert, short list Trying argue panic caused strokes virus? 

Not *all* *some*. sure. think *nobody* experiencing extra stress, anxiety, fear? Also mix reduced activity/mobility many seniors isolated. mix whole ""avoiding hospitals"" thing. think zero effect amount heart attacks / strokes people there? \*economic tensions

Racism gaps So... even better?

Why someone fever allowed public spaces, especially without mask, non-emergent reasons? pinch “walk off” Eh, people spend whatever money have. happens summer comes income?

It's also way easier budget fixed amount per month. Well gathering 250k + Sturgis 250 confirm cases Corona say work fine hopefully fingers crossed Come man, Sun sources.  scrapped thought?

Most willing downgrade good bar seedy bar side town particularly bad college towns students go bars significantly reduced capacity good reason keep things clean massive house parties masks, distancing, cleanliness. mean really, one’s objectively better other.

Yes, college towns boomer towns major issue. gonna argue here. state, biggest outbreaks Boomer City College City. goes temperature taking, screening without testing, several policies I’ve seen nothing waste money say “we’re something!” 

Again, probably preventing people going begin with. gonna publicly shamed/fined/quarantined even slight fever, gonna take temperature home fuck society like good little boy.

Idk deranged world someone could argue allowed outside fevers unless emergent causes like groceries medicine.

The best thing happen COVID troglodytes need touch everything go everywhere fever get shamed back homes.

So tired American mentality ""I AINT SICK DAMMIT, GOTTA PROVE STRONK AM"" 

I 100% bat eye person caused lose sick days ended dying. 6th grader 3rd grader really well online schooling. HOWEVER, work home make work, lot parents option. choices offered last years random person isn’t bad idea That's screening is. think asymptomatic spread less feared. want know *which* people test. did. anything goes Yes.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* genomic study showed US (at least midwest) late January earliest? December, deadly then? they're locking widely known politics rule, one things makes place bearable one discusses coronavirus posts, entire purpose subreddit. People want cry big bad orange guy, like rest Lemme tell ya, really puts damper trying read discussion forum seeing 99% discussion much trump sucks instead topic supposed about.

Hmm it’s almost allowed discuss state things without allowed discuss who’s responsible dumb way moderating subreddit. Sure. not. I've home today fever stomach problems, bet went work thermometer wall would also said 97.8 well. Everyday always place. close borders immigration protect others? zero reason ANYONE allowed immigrate USA now. it’s not. fact, roof. Personally prefer check bags possible. nice drag 25lb suitcase airport, especially layovers. Way less sweat, nobody hitting bag sitting bar, worrying overhead space running late last board.

In... probably 400 flights last five years I've yet lose bag across entire US Europe. back deodorant thank me. personally, don’t think I’m outlier among young people here, risk covid restrictions causing serious consequences mental health absolutely much higher risk serious covid infection consequences. one cares that. I'm sure come back bite us. know cancer took year off, missed cancer screenings due peoples fear definitely cause major issue next years. know know, *can* socially/physically distance still meet people person. Minigolf hiking couple ideas. 

You could also game nights movie nights STILL socially distance masks. district surrounding districts pay based contracted hours. say hey district next us makes $, look contract it’s based hours it’s essentially hourly rate work hours year.

And paid 42 weekly increments option paid summer.

But it’s certainly regional. blame everything COVID. Maybe sharks actually trees?! never advocated ""just stay closed country almost social support structures"".

Generally I've advocated identifying best practices early often, best operate scale, revising new info, dynamic approach learn more.

In order this, we'd need calm clear leadership able explain complex ideas leverage people's expertise wide array areas strategy balanced numerous moving parts. key skill would gaining trust transparency responsiveness feedback evolving data.

That lack tragedy many places, since baseline role executive branch us government level. December flu season. Covid influenza share similar symptoms, time, excess patients could likely severe flu symptoms. wouldn’t necessarily tested positive influenza. 

I saw several patients last winter severe flu symptoms; adults high fevers upwards 102F (very uncommon, even influenza), patients every single flu symptom fall within window would positive flu test test negative, otherwise healthy patients short breath early-on symptoms. time, assumed flu virus mutated, common time year, hadn’t seen get severe (in area least - rural Midwest) years. 

People die influenza. know this. haven’t personally looked data influenza deaths vs deaths ARDS around time, doubt several ARDS deaths due COVID-19. Covid deaths may mistaken influenza deaths deaths due post-viral infections. Election lol... I'm wary taking vaccine rushed. surprised American-developed vaccine causes cancer. great track record appreciating science. Bro I’m reading lmao

Does Sweden model work not

A simple yes suffice. Walls text generally mean “you’re right here’s you’re actually wrong” Agreed, simply difficult convey dripping scorn text. took mascara 16.  kids seems lot people fine risking kid's lives. pretty wild. course, include international passengers actually going White House. get tested. Ah usual fearmongering, cool.  *laughs Denver International Airport* 

In case anyone's curious ludicrously large airport. source claim? Sweden, reply, 'You can't compare Sweden countries!'


Unless Sweden's stats look great.



/s think interesting contrast Europe tested immediately landing got results texted within 24 hours. ""Hearsay information"", calling way discredit someone spreading true information using court standards normal outside world. fair year's flu season weaker most. Europe covid-19 hit countries negative 10-20% excess deaths January/February/March ish: Like terrorists pay flight lessons TSA pre check lmao  Sadly, TSA government jobs program lower class. Anyone removes voted office. Would help brought guns chanted stop putting lives danger sounds concerning since covered bases avoiding infection. Apparently mild bacterial infections lay dormant till triggered stress factors unless symptoms unique covid hopefully there's another explanation. odds dying quite low, lots covid survivrs lung scarring, chronic fatigue, tons problems. infects inside blood vessels; *long term* inflammation blood vessels leads atherosclerosis. know short term inflammation, probably good.

[A third Penn State football players got infected diagnosed inflammation heart common people exercise fighting virus. might recover completely, could possibly stick life, serious fatal ramifications decades future.

You're really better catching thing. recall joke think Norway, people really looking forward removal 1.5 metre social distancing rule get back usual 3 meters. dad legit smell vick's vapor rub, that's knew he'd gotten even test results came back. Inb4 conspiracy theorists: 'this proves covid cases/deaths rebranded flu deaths!!1!' know that. said, discussion happened back January. I'm sorry save it. separated cultural situation? ask I’m northerner I’ve heard “Florida man” stories Vast numbers partially trained amateurs tests. testers become infected pass people testing. Really unfortunate ask participants whether eating happening indoors outdoors. seems like huge missed opportunity. Article summer pointed really residential ""density"" (because, example, US dense compared NYC, yet touched). Rather, crowding/behavioral.

People live miles apart one another they're gathering every weekend hootenanny (or whatever), see spread.

This find idea Swedish culture interesting. Like, they're typically reserved, quiet talkers, close talkers, small social circles, etc., they're almost informally/unobviously socially-distanced first place. (Adding mask imposing lockdown alter baseline behaviors ""typical"" Swede much.) ignored subjects dealt previously. feel answered seems little left worthy discussion. 

Oh dear, really edit reply make look like ignored post. That's pretty embarrasing :) Would explain exacerbated grandfather's dementia. (He's much better!) problem people take away eat together someone's place less safe eating outdoor restaurant exactly Nowhere say 'there reports high numbers pneumonia back August 2019' claimed, simply study traffic flow one hospital Wuhan, debunked study findings - coronavirus may present Wuhan far back last August - reasons we've highlighted, highly useless promise you, haven’t. Hey! That's tsa ask people dined indoors outdoors: big flaw ""study"". really need know outdoor dining risky, not. obvious indoor dining risky. likelihood, caused AIDS. Protease inhibitors raise cholesterol ungodly levels. Steroids put stress major organs. Fatigue leads lack exercise causes poor cardiovascular stamina overall. Inflammation constant infections, possibly even infection heart itself. Yes, likely heart attack due AIDS. 

If wanted use better counterexample, said, “if died getting hit car,” or, “they died falling building.” point high risk factors common “healthy young people” mythical beast. *mumble mumble mumble*...

Nice try I've seen heard Trump downplay eyes ears. video saying go away Easter ridiculous claims diminishing severity. Another young causality also happened obese. Good reason obese pandemics. Glad hear case relatively mild. symptoms fully gone away lingering effects? Even neuropathy set brother meth take care it. least loads get bigger thicker. hits keep coming. wake every day thinking new ways screw worse. Also behaviour generational living conditions matter. UK bit hands Swedes likely living multi generational households.

Also UK may locked hard, response also really bad context situation. Density international travel much higher UK spread virus like crazy gov dithered. gov later dealt members violating rules broke public trust compliance lot. Whereas Sweden public much compliant milder official measures.

There's lot situation ""well call lockdown, they?"" course.  numbers bad makes sense Cuomo making frantic effort obscure them. un dato quindi crescita, anche se estremamente distante dai picchi registrati nel periodo peggiore della pandemia.

It literally says nothing compared peak. beats fat fuck though mention Trump all? 

Where say 200,000 deaths okay? displayed facts facts. 

What people without jobs businesses destroyed? debts? mental health toll taken majority population? deaths attributable poverty year leading causes death alone. need priorities me, everyone priorities divided could agree needs done. Assuming I'm monster seeing risk factors turning political you. Wait need turn gay? No, makes less ok. I’m sure part post read “ok”. You’re welcome!

Nothing happened opened beaches, outdoor dining, let tons protest happen, etc.
It's literally indoors recirculating air really spreads shit. soon bars opened FL, AZ, TX infection rates got really bad. type people go eat pandemic people taking seriously.

EGO driven science. Hygiene theater.

ALL things I've ranting months, people actually informed latest science push fight way noticed. 

From Osterholm studies masks effective, CDC ignoring denying evidence asymptomatic spread coming doctors Germany FEBRUARY, shitting contact traced outbreak studies early still understanding proper contact tracing SEPTEMBER, total denial evidence airborne spread (which clear day early contact traced studies called ""incomplete"", ""imperfect"", ""purely circumstantial""), AMERICAN science hand holding sensationalist television media nearly much failure administration.

So big difference public transport year compared last. I’m guessing, think fart smell comes gases like methane, poo particles. seems reasonable gases permeate mask, droplets can’t. age 2 Would person basically able breath talking effect amount cytokines body? Let tout whatever want. question whatever information get, regardless whether comes high official like Fauci average doctor. I'm saying believe one other, I'm saying question told act questioning information potential conflicts interest discouraged ridiculed person questioning position authority. trust Fauci anyone else, take word gospel happens spotlight COVID guidance. 

The man advised country believed hundreds thousands people country alone would dead now. ""expert"" held position authority. Admittedly, clean track record Fauci went along anyway without questioning anything, circus begin again.  numbers... Look point people decided don’t care health let alone anyone else’s. let country go mask less let nature take course. I’m fed hearing uneducated entitled people/businesses still treating pandemic like joke despite evidence it. can’t cure stupid way MIGHT learn find waiting list ventilator. decision made many lengthy discussions consultation public health experts,” said Miami University President Gregory Crawford.

Fauci made available podcasts, small market shows, whatever get real truth past administration's political filter. one deserves Nobel prize. hospitalizations still care tests NY Times reported potentially 90% false positives?

Why love live fear? toilet  adding without evidence children take influenza home, coronavirus.

Someone Reddit argued pointed schools spread sorts colds, flus, etc. 

I like, “what could possibly different SARS Co-V-2 would make behave differently every virus (including coronaviruses) history infectious diseases?” Right like - lets say particular vaccine ends causing side effects - like government making vaccine mandatory every individual upon get first. Luckily say - we've done research see potential. Can't make everyone happy. gym masks time every station taped off. sucks mandatory constant cleaning weight equipment, there's 0 complaints/covid cases.

with small .002% rough estimate would die, would say mental health, ie-gym (with sanitation), would surpass that. Probably, may little, late, usually hung other's rooms hours watching shit TV. definitely started show symptoms. soon suspected though, stayed apart. also 10 years younger me, could helped, too. Since can't workaround star paywalls, part metro in? Makes sad school districts around kc changed minds going person instead virtual. favorite SWA version ""If traveling child, simply someone acting like one,...""

Ha! Gets laugh matter many times hear it. Didn’t get students, clearly obese, sadly passed away.

Lose weight, survive Covid. hard message pass along. That's fair, also points politically polarized Reddit become. internet slowly sucked dry fun, joy, entertainment. cat runny nose sneezes like two months Covid hit US news. crazy thinking could Covid 19? 'Pandemic Policy' even together. world health crisis, political agenda. surprised all. Athens weeks ago one wearing masks distancing. like Florida back May always see virus killing African Americans? virus give shit race kill anybody. Pretend fake live life normal mask stop spread.  ""There reason walking around masks"" - Anthony Fauci

That's it. Done. 

Cuz guess there's still shortage hosptials. Yet everyone wearing masks.

And 60 minutes told clear air all. RNA vaccine better? understand calling censorship, feelings hurt. want political censorship that, special, special snowflake. 

But true. stuff came today proved knew bad downplayed political reasons. tape. 

My question enrage you? loyalty one politician strong literally matter many people knowingly kills? cancel trials, too. convenient.  guess go commerical gyms like LA fitness planet fitness. Two gyms truly abide rules dont staff enforce rules. Sure, disaster waiting happen.

If go private gym older crowd like price high business model keep people serious low crowd general, fine. example, go gym saturday known general peak time ill one gym Ignore him! Completely foreseeable, easily provable Americans assholes. super illegal bill medicaid patients. I'd report it. friend exposed Covid two days ago. took finger prick blood test tested negative. far I’m aware, aren’t diagnostic blood tests, antibody tests. one don’t know about? We’ve always war Eastasia. Wait, got gym made money selling home workouts. 

Thats suspicious. work, prettymuch everybody wouldn’t need isolate (and done, throughout whole pandemic).

How many workplaces would situation MANY vulnerable employed? guess few, since risk group retired.. stating statistical outlier isn’t great argument.

How normal would things feel “half busy usual” mean guess they’d feel pretty normal considering social places often higher younger demographic anyway.

High risk people would furlough scheme / stimulus cheque whatever Americans call it. Well want kids getting high acid. Ban it. Fauci mainstream opinion take seriously.

Yeah, he's thing called...rational. See also: *reasonable*.

And makes mistakes sometimes, would appear also make human. boo mighty fuck Astros! It’s anything get worked about. They’re pausing see vaccine cause person falling ill it’s result issue (I.e person immunocompromised, pre-existing condition etc.) use hearing aid? actually help much, uncomfortable? people know hearing issues refuse even consider hearing aid, really annoying. mean clearly find weird bad. People advocate move away tipping culture don’t actually give fuck servers, servers make tips would employer paid “livable wage” instead. increase food prices would make difference thus people would end paying less eat out. That’s real motivation. see servers don’t like tipping them, they’re cheap tip they’d rather prices increase 10% tip tip 20%. ""The pause"" makes confident vaccine trials. I'm afraid push vaccine without recommended testing. makes feel like following least rules!! say also man nothing fear breaks law, there's one would hold accountable Fauci escorted building thrown back unmarked van mean lot restrictions states, mask regulations, etc...and still 30,000-40,000 new cases day US. spreading somehow.

I know buy asymptomatic spread rare one. people showed symptoms spread this, doubt we'd many cases do. would die down.

I think there's lot unknown still misinformation there. say say

Yes, yes does. Fourth also confirmed clinical trial halted previously July participant experienced neurological symptoms. Upon examination, participant diagnosed multiple sclerosis, deemed unrelated Covid-19 vaccine treatment, said. Government spending? wouldn’t spending... would re-allocation. one thing guaranteed change. things crappy get better. things great, get worse. Can’t light without dark. Don’t want stick around see great things 2020? Trump flip flop king haha RA too. feels this. disagree, think vaccine estimates ambitious all. 

Throughout crisis, he's maintained COULD see vaccine much faster expected, he's moved prediction several times situation developed. able find good source Google there's ridiculous volume news vaccine time I'm looking old one, [here's late July mentions original conservative prediction reports predicted vaccine approved FDA well 2021.

And [updated moved forward time Anthony Fauci said Friday remains confident coronavirus vaccine ready early next year

And recently [this seems actually predicting vaccine end 2020. Something he's touched ""possible"", never predicted.

An ambitious prediction vaccine would've said back May something we'd end 2020. he's done opposite, started late 2021 slowly moved late 2020 situation gradually improved. far, he's done nothing push timeline. serious? seizures, demyelinating disease, serious neurological damage? Autoimmunity immune dysfunction rest life? Growing third eyeball might least worries.  Let dumb flow you. ""(Americans) dying, that's true, is,"" Trump said. ""But mean everything can. control, much control it"" it‘s important critical, it‘s vital nitpick. underemployed remote workers putting hours before. doubt productivity up, bullshit work definitely is. I've never gotten flu shot.

Also


AstraZeneca says 'no final diagnosis' Oxford COVID-19 vaccine trial participant, reports confirmed transverse myelitis Look happened Athens since UGA reopened August. cases doubled month. first link (business insider) shows changed advice, indicate ever lied them. 

Again, one point recommend masks, does, mean original statement lie. 

The data time indicated general public need masks. Remember, back beginning march, Business Insider link references, spread across US here. 20 cases Covid across entire US beginning March. 

Your second link mentions gain-of-function goes say ""At point scientists say possible—but likely—that pandemic virus engineered manipulated."" sure connection. Vietnam really resilient bunch people world. Defeated USA 60s, better China covid19... *Golf clap* Only? whole country 54 million used thirty people panicking. Sorry touched nerve, I'm always amazed cost weddings. Like, that's payment house!

Anyways, wish best, that's want spend money on, power you. nobody knows. could years away. average usually closer 10 years. research SARS concurrent production vaccine, etc., maybe within year possible still optimistic would record.

I'm skeptical vaccine available next 12 months would safe effective enough make sense give people 50 years old, assuming long term effects coronavirus recovery severe. Singapore island. Vietnam's numbers suspect. ROK Mongolia decent examples, Mongolia tiny ROK keeps re-shutting anyway. definitely!!! less isolating feeling. Wow 747’d you. cool kids volunteer first necessarily better worse, work (great), Dengue RNA vaccine actually made virus worse certain cases. seems bug appeal fact first vaccine doesn’t work, use formula mew vaccine, makes sense one facts interpreted either way support either side's point. 


Pro-school reopening: ""She must got activity unrelated classroom work then. In-person classes dangerous rest society is. unlucky."" 


Anti-school reopening: ""If someone like could die COVID, even observing stringent precautions work, imagine happens loosen precautions reopen schools in-person classes."" That's excuse, much like shortage disposable masks excuse Fauci tell people wear masks (even cloth ones). could go wrong?! isn’t dangerous job US moment.  

Easy hyperbole there, Santa. get another truckload hyperbole early next week.

I'm sure people run burning buildings, fight *annual* devastating wildfires west coast, LEOs face armed criminals every day would like dispute claim.  faculty staff strike.   

To end? Giving teachers larger salary reducing numbers days work per year going help fight covid-19. ""striking teachers"" going demand? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* see. sure helmet analogy would apply completely I've seen people cautious way people wearing masks I've seen wearing helmets. like almost everyone wearing masks, albeit wearing correctly think there's truth say I'm sure would equate helmet problem India (which big problem really found really good solution that)

I wanted offer wholesome perspective read comments see one side story. friends WashMo stunning belligerent much region kind suggestions masks. Worse make victims ""freedoms taken away"". removed reposting information. article front page mutch information much better written, we've gone one. Sorry. Why? person even going school they're fucking stupid!? selfish fucking shit bag. Like lesser Baldwin. What's bullshit article? methodology behind Sturgis ""study"" obviously flawed people treating objective truth. like head at. That's good way back estimate. Thank you.  temporary measures sunset clauses expired time. Perhaps self-serving reasons, case benefits people, wear masks inconvenience lawmakers well.

Anyway I’m guessing side that’s crying lost freedoms didn’t care Patriot Act got extended perpetuity (mostly targeted “others”), don’t exactly leg stand on. Fuck it, get covid, get covid, everyone gets covid. Remember teaching one safest professions got summers off....Those good times. understand sentiment, definitely. Seems like might bit bit premature yet....the *fast* tests onerous seems like keep thru end year. Chomo? Lol like Trump, Xi like doctor survive 80 percent vote conservative age fever easily masked counter drugs like ibuprofen dayquil Excuse ignorance they? Social distancing sustainable long term. I'm pretty sure that's Texas's reopening plan bite bullet send back home ports quarantine. fact got people still stranded sea appalling. states fuck teachers. expect nothing Charens wild. true. always lot easier say actually figure *how* it. replace move sad is. hell pull excess death from? knew it, i've never sad right before. know trump downplayed affects... results. CAUSED massively disorganized response lack ability lead. EVERY country (except others) took serious said deadly president intentionally downplayed seriousness this. Unconstitutional must act protect assets rich friends. people Facebook small redneck town gonna say ""See? kills old people whatever want!"" like old people go public somehow less human. guess letting grandma die ventilator fear life worth eating Olive Garden triggering libs. listening trump anything all? trust dipshit told sky blue. too. 9-11 attacks since TSA started: 100% success. sure sure still news. Doesnt change fight it. declining case numbers declining positivity rate per Johns Well considering definitely 15 passed screening cause show symptoms time, I'd say risks fairly low. listen POTUS give clue. anyone know length time (it varies, yday 1 hour 30min) wearing mask nose/sinuses (it feels like nose) start 'burn'. unpleasant, unpleasant enough make want stop every couple minutes there's one around breathe without mask on.

I've using cotton mask. need washing perhaps? get better one use disposable ones? That's happens last place. here, wife Teacher one seems care happens them? Honestly feel like deliberate inaction action needed year, decisions not-so-coincidentally happen fuck Americans retaliation impeachment. wants hurt America loving him. Frighteningly incorrect. damn really makes u think  school cannot abdicate responsibility charges school reason students community. OP isn’t American. saying don’t care politics. Coronavirus disappointed.  Testing, screening. them, anyway quote yourself: 
""Edit: commesss Swedes. [Read brainwashed believe god word."" 
Q.E.D., one assume tone. now? communicate hard-headed Swedes. See, tone. Yeah, American passport pretty much good leveling wobbly table local covid coffee shop days. get stay enjoy mess til actual plan get rid covid. okay like Americans. rest avoid.. There’s lot half-truths spread Oxford vaccine.

“It’s non-profit.” No, used weasel words said would would make profit “during pandemic.

“It’s old tech.” No, it’s cutting edge. never human-approved generic viral vectored vaccine.

“They’ve development longer mRNA vaccines.” 2018 MERS vaccine phase beat Moderna’s 2015 Bird Flu phase I. mean they're recommending follow CDC guidelines, nothing official. appears lot people around strongly masks, however I'm getting vibe comments local Facebook pages I'm sure reliable is. 

Fortunately, STL banned school sports games/competitions. However, practices still allowed. you, boo.

First, premise pretty much foregone conclusion. even news? look demographic chart who's affected see obvious.

Second, large study. corroborated 1000 graphs though, least keen sense obvious.

Not sure defensive one article. need coverage decent science, stuff. biggest thing FL school districts would lose ENTIRE funding open brick mortar, districts caved it. everyone wants children babysat send em off. get control even mean? Wear masks arbitrary number hit, take shoot back again? Many retired early. There's teachers career anymore strike. Read brainwashed ninnies believe god people assuming tone.

lol wouldn’t able anyway, kinda pointless ask. Asking high risk individuals would interesting. 

Also interesting republicans still behind democrats lot accepting it, wonder changes Trump takes endorses it. girlfriend teacher. One concerning things she’s talked classroom masks mandatory, recess, masks aren’t required. Doesn’t make sense, it? I’m giving 2 months schools go virtual. actually expected push 15-18 years ago Tech Crash.  think tried Infrastructure countries wasn’t robust enough support model.  decade half later, infrastructure it.  2001, lower level colleges universities India still taught programming paper. limited computers local colleges.  case today, online learning allowing Indian tech students match American skills. Aww shucks, poor Butters. 😢 Smash Mouth new Nickleback shit communicating level headed way discussing. Except one definite invisible definite. He's putting muzzle photo. Hmm... easy treatment hypertension, it’s hilarious much money people spend drugs treat it.

Sleep, diet, exercise, drugs (caffeine, alcohol, etc.) know Walmart, I'll tell *do* know: 

* N IL city, two places provide free tests. simply drive up. charge you, ask insurance information effort recoup cost insurance carrier. 

* Physicians Immediate Care (they located IL IN) provides same-day results. insurance carrier covers provider, cost. boss going go there, changed mind finding he'd pay front get reimbursed insurance carrier cover provider. 

To knowledge, insurance ""charging"" supposed write off/pay testing expense. we've hearing offices/providers ALSO charging ""doctor visit"" insurance covering testing, often portion due visit itself. 

Honestly, best bet call Walmart ask them. Call insurance carrier verify. 

Best luck! I'm getting tested tomorrow. Yes, 3 weeks slowly came back. could smell hours day, gradually got longer longer. watch white chariots Mommy Wasnt Iceland well listed strains population? Cannot find report might completely wrong here. Cool, responsible mess either. Three chances vote president lifetime voting fascism. picture seems off. 30% lady thinner 25%. Luckily top scientists world many different countries examining Oxford’s data well specific volunteer. scientists feel comfortable continuing, think we’re good. International passengers? thought one could fly US currently?? holy shit 400k people died car crashes year? hope put safety measures place genius!! way working vaccine difficult expected. think earliest possible date probably mid 2021. That's actually rare case. people got shafted, evidenced sub. 
Especially earning that, pandemic killed job.

Your case might case people like who's college student, *most* people got shafted money. people even receive theirs. wildly inconsistent.

People can't pay bunch things almost purposely let system. travesty.

Also, could making stimulus still enough pay bills previously two jobs one closed, etc. That's even get money begin with. mess. get sick, screwed. lose job insurance, also screwed. part issue. Same. live CA work outdoors year. great little gym backyard. miss fancy gym five+ days week prior I’m going let pandemic ruin fun.  No, people assuming tone. They're implying Johan Carlsson said it. He's known tv Sweden definitely sounds like something he'd say. I've heard others health agency say similar things likely true.

Carlsson work directly health agency, understanding he's hired freelance basis. Lmao.

Not gonna dissect post start freaking hamster study. reviewers paper mean? lmao really one question rhetoric users. setting tone thread. says article contracted Covid students returned school. Hopefully vaccine effective, unlike protective gear as“aid” gave used publicity. better offices. PM 1 2 days week. enough work everyone WFH due systems implemented. great see enough. much work home he's taken 4 state vacations since pandemic hit. Oh masks mandated, soon doors closed, one gives shit.

This entire situation exposing lot underlying corruption lack leadership lot locations career fields. worried hot zones, move better part town./S Wow that’s amazing, thought misinformed, he’s actually lying knows lies kill lots people.

Bob Woodward isn’t good making sentences he.  ""truth"", either. Wealthy districts money put sorts things. Many districts trouble paying routine upkeep building, they'd need extra funding that. course, economy tanked, states money give away. leaves federal government, Sec Ed wants public schools die.... bad. Thanks correction. Customers required wear masks. Masks aren’t enforced schools. agree worded differently. wife works school district. cancelled person make teachers go in, sit office. assembly zoom, school buy licenced version, teachers sit gym watch meeting giant tv. think educator administrators might idiots..... article. myelitis serious condition involving inflammation spinal cord cause muscle weakness, paralysis, pain bladder problems. rare instances, vaccines triggered cases transverse myelitis; although also caused viral infections. I'm sure mean, people survived different fashions, caught original strain caught another strain, one fine, became terribly ill (but survived).

You may interpreted response way that's said.  numbers cases therefore numbers deaths we’ve seen far impacted measures we’ve taken. Data meaning placed context. example, cannot look cancer rates people general population rely say exposed high level radiation nuclear disaster Chernobyl Hiroshima dangerous cancer serious.

I’m sure health officials looking data countries taken different measures see they’ve fared consider do. opening schools, it’s interesting look Sweden’s data never closed first place and, suggested, relied older/vulnerable demographics self-isolate. They’ve twice deaths Canada per million thus far, unfortunately taken measures track many linked schools. US also double numbers per capita, patchwork closings reopenings. Peoples concerns schools feelings, concerns rooted facts.

Elderly people completely self isolating realistic dependant others help. Even avoid children altogether, it’ll challenging, impossible, avoid people who’ve come contact children. Opening schools still gamble cost lives. real question whether it’s worth given expect data have. don’t shut highways car accidents exist schools flu season. It’s tough know what’s right apprehensive legit. Yuh think? sending daycare try digital without teacher parent present better way costs arm leg even find one mean Eric? much sodium online gaming. Trump really needs Q3 jobs report wow amaze cost. 44*0=0
Cali 155 deaths yesterday. 

155 0 population adjusted . go take issue tone, mostly agree view.

That's argument having, though. argument inherently wrong, would wrong literally every issue ever. always two sides. nuance world. even given examples. protest marches rock concerts, density levels dramatically different.

You protest march safe distance. rock concert, people packed everyone wants close front get— fine normal times, normal times. There's six different strains Covid-19 statement proof people get infected different strains. There's also around 12000 mutations happened Covid-19 virus. 

*""But, two examples, still unclear frequently reinfections occur. 26 million known coronavirus infections worldwide far, reinfections might cause worry — yet, says virologist Thomas Geisbert University Texas Medical Branch Galveston. need lot information prevalent is, says.""*

There even case back February/March person Iceland infected two different ""strains"" time. 

And said, absolute majority people getting infected develops antibodie decline even 4 months. Yea went work screening last year, BP 150. Luckily took pills usually normal now. ""given know infected different strains"" - yes two(!) cases, even virologist say ""a reinfections might cause worry""

Fine fear-mongering work here. That's people understand wfh push. They're euphoria phase get keep high salaries benefits saving money time commuting. Well guess what, global economy, millions replaced cheaper foreign workers. sharing blessings

Spoken like true capitalist. Uses words ""sharing"" ""unequal"" sentence.

Socialism paying people they're worth first time instead forcing working class fight better pay. Capitalism trusts ruling class treat working class nicely. Spoiler alert, that's never happened human history need someone watch kid work. Idk, I’m feeling lucky sahm right time online school kiddo younger one doesn’t go daycare. There’s right choice, everything negatives. Times crummy right now. looks super fat even cropped pic.

Obesity bad health people Ha. knew States lot guns unaware outnumbered people. Maybe, I’m starting think, he’s still downplaying little? It’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation. models used federal government guide policy decisions. see like see people dying. US, we've also going decades ""law order"" popular idea. Politicians made careers side police. reason, education popular. Hearing side effect one happened good news. Also good news something treated own, usually lasts weeks. live that.

Hopefully major issue, things progress. Oh okay. Let’s that! gf quit job teacher could online teaching. amount teachers walking around campus without masks shocking. pretty much divided like politics. realize teachers petri dish crowded hallways social distancing can't applied small space.Schools biological bombs witnesses slow huge explosion.Right?? Agreed!!! Funny hearing recommendations WHO, good job Pakistan! 100% Florida 🙄 "" No, right, capitalist system working perfect. ""

Putting words others' mouths make seem smarter.

""A better system needed"" uttered people every generation ever civilization history. So, again, know better system general whining? even say name thought HIM, you? really? people coming second time? Italian population underlining conditions like type 2 diabetes can't positive cases check them. Surprise surprise 🇨🇳 Except well known bunch people, infection, one enclosed space.

Each one could underlying health concerns could exacerbated others party. Also college party, means recreational drugs alcohol. Two things human body take fighting life threatening disease.

This kid knew doing. Trying cute playing simantics. wait days passes either party goers symptoms get worse, probably endangering lives. really know? believe COVID probably earlier realize, negative influenza tests alone don’t mean COVID. metapneumovirus, RSV, parainfluenza? Unless tested I’m sure say increased coughs December means COVID spreading community... - certain leaders told Americans wear masks mocked people wore Yep. German getting information Reddit (ik sounds ridiculous) simply can't draw clear picture everything.

There so, many examples hypocrisy either side guess comment get deleted mention I'll leave point Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lol dumb question simple, that's getting simple answer.  FYI covid dangerous flu people, it’s get older like 60 death rate passes flu. problem covid it’s deadly elderly risk populations. whole population denominator, also infection rate. Kinda takes wind Cuomo’s sail. virus extremely politicized America. Depending side ask it’s either control big deal it’s everywhere going kill us questioning reasoning doubt.

Personally, expect scientific articles Economist rigorous Nature, economist reputation getting facts right. confused point Owning Woodward like owns libs Yup. Lot tall fur hats around sudden. 6 months live worth decimating society according sub. grandma might croak therefore cant hug anyone. know half half well like, like less half half well deserve. would contacted anyone had. good overview. misinterpreting cross reactivity (the fact prior exposure another Coronavirus may help T-cells identify Sars-COV-2) mean people immune think, really shown practice yet make total sense Tcells kick infection already occurred. may help people fight virus better. Also, misleadingly attribute slowdown exponential growth cell theory, even though there's evidence that's case. Rather, likely related combination heterogenous dispersion, lower mobility, restrictions, mask use, etc. /r/BINARYTHINKERS one wants go anyways Americans aren’t allowed world won’t time. shit.

How supposed safe remove mask every time eat?

What bathroom stalls? Social distancing then?

People come grips tackle problem correctly, make changes survive. know coming intention protect others sure, agree isolated islands, whole population mask beginning spread.

US isolated enough, leaders told us wear masks first 2 months.  Ooh, yes *ma'am.* Please, excuse misstep. I'll take two pennies back fuck right off, thank putting place.

May another? Covid Related job losses May 28th 40 million. Due health insurance supplied country directly affects people’s non Covid related healthcare. [See simple situation.

In perfect world we’d government intervention would pay people stay home prop employers couldn’t weather storm. However, live ‘Murica that’s much like socialism us.

So instead opened Non essential business prop service economy Covid cases 1st world country.

But 40+ million without jobs suffering, possible much many Covid. die due lack health coverage. number less 200,000 died covid US deaths result. human misery 40 million felt years never recover.

Coronovirus hand kill more. majority kill elderly infirm. Whereas majority suffer economic devastation young healthy.

As said it’s fair argument reopen let Covid run it’s course. personally don’t agree it. valid argument. much needs many versus needs issue. Check tobacco smoking there. Think laced something. mean...this entering argument territories ""well flu kills us cares COVID""

Yes, Covid killed LOT people. me, mean want able safety measures place avoid another 9/11. Sweden irregular reporting schedule, smooth increased much all. stuck low level. distancing, wearing mask constantly, sanitizing washing hands every half hour least I'm work, yet cold. still get cold, even matter? Can't infected even easier covid? earth supposed do. Ok many days initial infection fever? many days contagious? Id willing bet money answer 3. effective precaution all. Im even sure fits definition precaution. suspect that? Yup, project planning call reseller Philippines. Right America, Brazil, Russia Philippines pretty much bad guys world due words actions leaders. want keep shoes on. Give shot. won’t tell name. guess didn’t mention 37, good shape, multiple potential preexisting conditions. Thankfully lung issues. F**k Mike Pence defending Trump lying American people seriousness virus. knew said nothing. legacy. never elected President Americans never forget lied people died  Oh things! we're point actually imagining people covid covering infection smuggle like terrorists. Give break. That's real amateur cheating. know generate random number Excel? Sure places start around 60k. replying someone said 50k nearly unheard salary teacher. teacher know good number coworkers teachers surrounding districts make 6 figures year. trying use information refute posters argument It’s simple. Coronovirus ultimately human misery death, call human cost. know kills people alter lives survive it.

However, closing economy also human cost. death rate may lower it’s zero. deaths despair feel hopeless face economic destitution. also die longer afford basic necessities keep healthy. see lose health insurance end homeless. combine long term misery financial future forever altered downward direction. 

This nuance. Ultimately side effects closing economy could blunted prevented robust public policy interventions. consistently seen inability governing groups, primarily republicans.

But look acknowledge it’s complexity starts become obvious shutting economy without costly policy interventions complex human cost. Coronovirus affects destruction economy affects many fair argue let covid run course. personally disagree position it’s fair argument. going happening Alberta. K-12 went back last week Grades 4-12 told wear masks. offer online many sending back person need go work don’t ability home (set up/infrastructure, etc).

New daily cases Province ~100-150+ day last couple weeks already. Edmonton Calgary active cases area safe. Active cases dropped ~50 0 couple weeks ago back ~17 schools open expect go up.

A colleague mine spent week home kid due sniffles (negative test) many parents going able every sniffle year without losing jobs managed hold onto (and daycares won’t take sniffly kids either).

ETA: heard local news high school mile away outbreak. Yay! think straining bit. kinda seems like second. USA seems moving way  This. us fence taking ""before election"" actually concerned taking something gone rigorous trials vaccines (because takes years).

If companies test willing volunteers prove general public mostly effective preventing severely limiting spread COVID, I'm I'd probably go get soon available, assuming I'm allergic high risk adverse reaction.

It's wait see game right now... one likes want ""insta cures"" things. Reducing people’s mental anguish happy meals example tone-deaf stance pro-lockdown side. I’m obviously talking trivialities like chowing fast food McDonald’s (which haven’t done least 30 years). I’m talking soulless life devoid intimacy, culture adventure many seem almost welcome. Six months, people manage. years? happening. travelled Europe last month needed see parts world people dealing virus balanced way. trip restored hope human nature prevail madness. Dang, food delivered daily isn’t cheap. Especially teacher’s salary, imagine. Add zeros number final number. vaccine probably work pushed trump say saved America.

Christmas/thanks giving /new year /black Friday +winter going nightmare. Yes, used live UK, never heard able get health check-up without cause NHS. First gotta symptoms get checked something exactly? it’s ending? begin with? Duuuuuuude... hit nail head right there.

I teach school Philly serves kids foster care, wanted us return fulltime. raised clamored enough get go hybrid model, returned last week found director took covid money bought new lunchroom tables!!! Like, WTF?!?! colleague asked regular cleaners come clean building - said ""we money."" ""So, where's covid money?"" ""It's spent - tables stuff.""

Un-fucking-believable.

I'm sure sheer stupidity repeated ad nauseum across country incompetent morons. Metoprolol helluva drug. --Rick James imagine little kid hearing teacher sit room 30 hours week died virus, terrified EVER go inside classroom small space ever life think kid brain you’re gonna die too? That’s going PTSD unravel therapy years. *maybe* care race due genetics ACH2 receptor prevalence low economic resources/ jail tied increased exposure risk affects black hispanic more. family actually move cheaper place so..... Former Trump Train rider here. jmped full speed sat twiddling thumbs China locked 45m people. 

The Republicans already saying convenient vaccine delayed. Something Democrats trying make Trump look bad delaying Biden slipped polling. Apparently ""suspiciously convenient"" clinical trials working intended.

If came endorsed today, would say fact released yet conspiracy Trump. America never never done good anyone ever!!!! Burn witches!!! Funny supported claims links directly CDC. DNC sold idea picked Biden. would recommend reading digesting article posting next time. indians care rules social distancing

Just give perspective.

I went today like 4-5 months get ear checked (ENT clinic) surprised see everyone wearing masks street. around 70-80% crowd normal still lot see person without mask. clinic sanitizer contraption sprays press foot pedal hospitals. Docs full body surgical suite exposes part body patients glass helmet front facr. receptionist screen her. medical store rope tied front shop meter away counter. would put prescription container accessible stand pay using UPI/Gpay. 

I live tier 1/2 city. people seemed kinda lax in, masks pulled down, group young peeps talking considering fact many people choice go work earn living, people following rules ever expected follow. Yeah, no, idea percentage maskless people Sturgis rally *any way* par percentage maskless protestors ridiculous. Look myriad photos available events, *please*. exceptions, course (on sides), generally speaking FAR people protests wore masks, essentially one rally bothered. people wear masks social distance without government telling to, give shit fellow citizens. Clearly, don’t here. really matter point - US country spreading cases countries, keeping out.

Here Canada #1 biggest fear many people around COVID-19 eventual reopening Canada-US border. Georgia. shut month. Nearly lost business (working 84 sort means, making ends meet sole proprietor). course Georgia heavily criticised decision thank God state allow reopening. parents would lost means support themselves. Yeah, covid eventually go away (either vaccine everybody able injected get, millions dead), people going wearing masks, sanitizing everything, social distancing, etc, long time afterwards woefully unprepared covid want prepared next pandemic. predict movie theaters cease exist people want take risk companies realize put movies onto streaming services without hurting bottom line much. Airlines may require least strongly recommend masks, may lower ticket prices bring back customers. Work home normal while. Military Times done good reporting Covid. Despite failures federal government seems like military actually understood thing along. like soldiers wearing proper N95. Things like important - senators wearing bandana tv models wrong sort behavior attitude combat crisis. “Hey guys! know make us look better, could compare case rate *entire continent* case rate *country*.”

These aren’t apple apple comparisons here. Europe also twice many people US does. entire continent 12% still reflects pretty poorly us. Yes, that’s currently law Texas. teacher strikes lose benefit assiciated theur employment including pension (and teachers don’t get social security). Yes, it’s terrible. bad law needs challenged cost challenging lose retirement savings. 

“Texas Government Code, Sec. 617.003. Prohibition Strikes Public Employees.

  (a) Public employees may strike engage organized work stoppage state political subdivision state.

  (b) public employee violates Subsection (a) forfeits civil service rights, reemployment rights, rights, benefits, privileges employee enjoys result public employment former public ...doing the same thing over expecting different results! One last bit.

Median age two states 2 year difference. Florida much older population.

This fun! Thanks. patriot act supposed expire 2005. saying mask mandate right wrong, act like things constantly pushed perpetuity right either. lol could understand fact people get joke continue down-voting I've explained kinda retarded  biological definition distinct line, varies several years individuals. would pointless try use it. warned SARS like illness right. Trump electoral college winning key states 80,000 votes. one inherited Obama (who painstakingly revived Bush destroyed 2008 financial crash) proceeded nothing inequality entire term eventually tanked denying existence pandemic virus? 

Keep living alternate reality 200,000 dead (1/4 dead globally) many facing long term health consequences, mass evictions, unemployment. great foundation we’re left chart economic recovery! Dammit I’ve discovered! argue technicalities day. reality is:

1. Xi dictator every meaningful sense word.
2. CCP clearly brutal corrupt. clear looking ongoing genocide Uigurs alone, let alone mountains crap they've pulled.
3. Nobody right mind believe anything CCP says face value. 
4. Yes, propoganda exists West, government exercise direct control media. CCP directly controls Chinese media.
5. said, also seems clear (even dissenting accounts China) CCP controlled COVID-19 better many nations, including USA. sodium. 

There nothing quite pleasurable trying live low sodium diet going Big Mac larges fries one day lunch. golden brown fries salted right level induce ecstasy. like Ronald McDonald pinned forced crispy, golden brown phallus mouth. 🍔🍟 wave it? still first wave, moved second one? OK, look slope graphs past weeks. Europe going up, USA not. example, France gone 500 cases per day month ago 7,000 now. complicated see. 4th grade math. 50% ""I anyone babysit kid home"", 50% ""Donald Trump told deal it."" studies percentage people long lasting effects hospitalized? wrote intentionally misleading. say RATES. two people deserted island 1 infected rate 50%. Peak nyc waaay waaay that. Must much safer outbreak island. ""due pandemic"" might accurate.

I'd need see source we'd know that's people normally would die given day also, CDC reporting 96% covid deaths actually average 2.6 causes so, number 1200 stand alone headline necessarily scary... I'm always interested hearing people come data please, it, Id like read source. Yeah, knew that. thing people overlook definition ""vaccine"". Everyone's treating like it'll (mostly) prevent infection, believe criteria lowers risk getting covid *or* lowers risk spreading covid *or* lowers risk serious effects covid.

And type vaccine that's first approved effect order decide give people vaccine. know actual discussions, like first vaccine cuts risk side effects, maybe first set non-first-responders get people nursing homes; cuts risk getting infected, maybe first (non-first-responders) people essential personnel got kept work - grocery clerks public transit workers garbagemen.

Hospital workers (laundry crew, janitors, cafeteria workers), teachers school support staff need priority well. people vaccine trials? Half got placebos, took risk rest us; deserve *some* priority ""real"" vaccine?

Then there's question handling administration. Personnel major medical centers easy, give work nurse watch socially-distanced room adverse reactions. Smaller rural groups harder. far, likely vaccine candidates, need stop using vial six hours first opened. Since want waste vaccine, want much traveling vial open; efficient get groups come you. need schedule them, arrive time, know much vaccine need.

In areas groups, depending vaccine, may want limit disruption vaccinating everyone household group instead one two people actual priority.

Then there's complication cold storage. refrigerated trucks pharmacy fridges maintain range somewhere 30 45 degrees (roughly). Moderna vaccine *needs* stored -4F, Pfizer Biontech candidates *need* stored whopping **-94F**. Maintaining temperatures distribution going hard. guy happily driving pickup tiny towns day heat Texas summer, Walmart-bought Igloo cooler seat next him. expensive moderately rare equipment, especially transport (mostly they're used one location like lab rarely moved another building), there's pressure source freezers really high demand before.

And finally, there's fact number vaccines look like they'll need two shots, 2-4 weeks apart, get full response. means setting schedule, need schedule follow-up trips, likely whole series people going miss first second shot various reasons, including illness. schedule *those* visits means areas going wait longer *their* turn, going make angry.

Or, people keep saying: complicated. restrictions last two weeks apply graduate students, faculty, staff members. growing number cases particularly pronounced among students living off-campus “where people wear face coverings practice social distancing,” Blank widely circulated Instagram video posted Monday showed students crowded narrow hallway, drinking red plastic cups, without wearing face coverings socially distancing. SCP-049 entered chat sounds counterintuitive, lockdowns actually cause less economic damage. 1918 pandemic, areas hard lockdown recovered faster economically. areas tried stay open ""for economy"" took years longer recover. 


 Thats saying, one got sick protests ""Guys communism work time 9th time's charm!!!"" sad frustrating. family members FL laws tested positive caring niece (for weeks technically live there) sending school school policy would list truent unless someone listed household tests positive.

If state state policies make easier spread virus right thing stay home whole state fucked. 

My wife gave trying get considerate teachers everyone around hopeless. going flea markets, grocery stores, etc days symptoms mostly go away. Love Leave it??? Yes, mostly handguns hunting rifles. automatic weapons people still taste back March.
And damage organs could knock years life well. comes open enough accept there's one form government dem0cracies effective people What’s increase daily cases? works physical therapy according Facebook, hope gets fired concern health welfare people. working risk people!  interesting case follow. 

They’re looking make example them. lies entry form airport others directly violated executive order. 

The authorities know party goers get away world know open season party vacation island. yeah sure, that's plan wait bit. think there's like 200 vaccines trials right now. I'm definitely gettting first one immediately matter what. Actually, even wanted I'm definitely priority population get right away anyways, yes, researching looking data. sarcasm? love God, please sarcasm. Ah, 44 sovereign countries 1 numbers back want to. Sounds unbiased... Yeah point too. go hospital risk untreated hypertension worse risk catching covid hospital. COVID confirmed people don’t know assess risk, see mofos speeding mopeds, helmet mask on. thought Trump shut International travel?


Why quarantine international travelers like countries? I'm sure hotels would like businesses.

Well thats wrong.

I mean .. let's imagine disease ridiculously high reproduction rate. Something like R=5.

That would mean it, 3 - 5 days infectious going normal life school, work, socializing, home, etc .. ""no-caution life""... would pass virus 5 people people come contact with. people sat next work stood next store hugged got home .. 5 would get sick. ""Only"" 5.

And would super-mega crazy contagious virus ""quintupled"" every days. would MONSTER.

So .. Covid nowhere near that.

There's whole car whose walls part ceiling windows, tables comfy chairs facing windows, couches, great. 

Also, feel like air travel ""Ugh get soon possible, that's matters"", travel train really connects land. gentle (sometimes abrupt) change geography joy too. 

It's great. course feasible extra time, feel like would really worth go route family personal vacation. Here's one peer review published showing amount people infected Covid drastically higher March reported, would lower CFR. also got zero traction subreddit posted. Like reason, people like bad news. *This* vaccine. vaccine comes election every scientist see skeptical. said something pathetic petty really demonstrated ignorant fragile beliefs are.

Ahh, first resort arrogant anyone bow you. suggest even people never tested? away airport security screening? F-in crazy? lot wackjobs there. nice idea. Take too. end thing would massively spread spread making decision die. kind lines reopenings also recently started takes time infections start spreading again. suspect might see rise cases positivity rate end September October. Could wrong think likely happen not. goes shitty airports like MCI precheck line Real stretch, mean microanalyzing speech taking verbatim clearly dismissive masks, yah guess want ignore interview microanalyze speech verbatim form transcript seems little reasonable. Sadly agenda watched interview clearly acted like masks uncessasary, really work well using them. know lot people watched interview demeanor clearly dismissive masks opposite, clearly lied deliberately. never fooled though, knew masks unbelievable important basic medical knowledge everyone whole world point wearing them, pretty inane point gave hint whatsoever masks something dismissive of. numbers need context. many young adults age 18-34 infected SARS-CoV-2 need go hospital? Lol gayyyyyyy Well isn’t justification possible died? take absolutely pleasure seeing someone die. However, chronic smokers fare worse die, don’t think I, someone never smokes, won’t relieved life choices paying now? thing goes obesity drug use. Harambe died Put shoes moment. Imagine posted Mountain Dew (not Diet Dew) healthy, nutritious food item available grocery stores United States today.""

How would interact made statement? possible way civil discussion person believes Mountain Dew healthy food choice available? know like me. Uh, there's third scenario: side effect *is* caused vaccine, numbers great effective? possibility we're trying eliminate.  Guess proves he’s gay then?

 /s correct. TM rare complication viral infections also similar reason rare cases caused viral vaccination But, refuse rate whole USA? article beef argument ""Florida worst state union"" everbody love read. people get must fault preexisting comorbidites something. Aka effect us healthy. would died got sick anyways cold us. politics playing cases. one referring to: study published last month researchers University Notre Dame concluding upwards 100,000 people contracted virus US March 2020 could drastically change CFR. find one reading transmission.

But regards part comment. People stay top information know this, every comment section subreddit acting like death sentence acting like end world. subreddit absolutely full hyperbole overreaction good talking global health crisis.

Overall, appreciate Michigan taking steps thank put lives line essential work ways include actions, words. imagine especially helpful essential workers already happened community college, may help could afford get little bit ahead, too. would love see states follow suit! Aw seem like nice helpful cunt! international passengers? Let's sugar coat things people inaccurate view time line appease children's sense time? get 5000 30k plus involved trials vaccine So, **really** meant say every virus makes sick makes sick.

FTFY Yeah I'm probably smartest person ever Yes, also buy Cheerios cereal instead Frosted Flakes. Also, oatmeal (especially bulk) incredibly cheap also extremely healthy. need stop excusing poor food choices. would also add beans bought dry bulk excellent food choices, rice quite cheap (certainly pasta). lot vegetables carrots zucchini quite cheap bought bulk. Certain things like tomatoes expensive - buy canned tomatoes use dishes it’s often lot cheaper (also Roma tomatoes cooking lot less vine tomatoes). really criteria holding now? ""hey, well least bombed"" CEOs head cheerleaders/salespeople companies. Ask CFO instead - they’re realistic executives since oversight financial statements.  1. don’t even know that’s paused trial. That’s speculation 

2. don’t know long term effects COVID

3. 1/5000 number bullshit multiple countries involved trial 5000 people given vaccine. 

4. someone else pointed out, ventilators barely used haven’t helping

5. pretend neurological issues don’t happen naturally. I’m saying it’s related vaccine, rather I’m saying it’s wrong claim without information (which halted now). someone received vaccine doesn’t mean every health issue may go away. previous halt caused neurological symptoms turned individual multiple sclerosis wasn’t related vaccine. *We gonna get right. get right. gonna work getting right. next time.. gonna get right* 

Bill Burr, 2014 Mm actually. built societies like closeness others. like meeting people organically actually comfort surrounded humans. can't interact strangers, youre missing pretty important aspect human. 

We invented concerts, nightclubs, bars, festivals like them. impulse them. That's true haha I've seen lots flights Asia US fyi flu symptoms last months. Whether active infection debatable, clinical signs persist. true, international students buy way good undergrad school. HOWEVER, many excellent talented international students US graduate school programs, bar get even higher US students. good, talented people come incredible research, scared come back -- either ongoing pandemic, environmental issues, threats POTUS visas revoked take person classes.

We celebrate bring best brightest country, scare away. aware there's preprint released today suggest Vitamin could potentially harmful regards COVID.

You small number cases barely changes anything. cases don’t transmit transmission chain keeps breaking down.  still take fucking shoes off?! Noice developed world, would say yes control managed well enough. missteps mistakes generally dealt rational manner. 

In developing countries (India) declining countries (USA), control. 

Funny enough countries progressive governments seem better (Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway much western Europe) countries right wing populist leaders (USA, Russia, Brazil, India) seem worse. likely progressive idea listening experts creepy uncle Facebook. Horrible. However, doubt mask mandates school effective, either. school district reopening, despite objections many others, premise it'll fine kids teachers wear masks. they? can't imagine struggling keep masks 30 kindergarteners day. mouth must scream? people symptoms December, deaths start spiking March April?



And U.S. since late 2019, upset China telling us everything? U.S. known? anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers anything say it. Hell, might purposely spread normal flu spite, say it'll make immune Covid. 1/100 risk death COVID? 1/1000 I'm young enough?

I think much lower that, even. live 3 hours regular paper day cardboard, fine. Surface bases transmission rare confirmed case someone got infected surface, worry it. "" clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" troll, lost morass ignorance. say anything freedom. That’s pretty important point know *should* story. It’s difference putting kids hotel two weeks building field hospital campus. Diagnostic there's reason believe someone it... either contact someone COVID, exhibiting symptoms, reason. Surveillance random sampling campus population large. myth, getting rice, potatoes, chicken veggies cheapest way shop groceries Yet another reason favor human challenge trials winnow field Covid vaccine candidates.

Conventional Phase 3 trials take vaccine preliminary safety signal (from Phases 1 2) give thousands people hopes randomly come contact coronavirus. turns unacceptable risk severe side effects, odds least two patients suffer side effects anyone notices pattern stops trial.

Compare human challenge trials every participant exposed virus. Based [estimates could run 50-subject placebo-controlled HCT Britain expectation power ongoing 10,000-subject conventional trial. HCT much cheaper easier--and safer terms expected number severe illnesses, unless think Covid young healthy person 200x dangerous vaccine yet passed Phase 3.

We still need large conventional Phase 3 trials identify side effects, actually puts subjects greater risk aggregate jump straight Phase 3 without HCT efficacy. worst case, suppose vaccine injected thousands volunteers realize often causes antibody-dependent enhancement. bragging, son.

Just facts, showing wrong were.

Something know used being.

Game. Set. Match. Says troll account created 5 months ago took whole month start posting begging free karma.

Delightful. gave pretty good hints way thinking post reddit yes. basicaly every one now. Trump going fuck absurd policies Chinese students (and international students) Why, enough dead bodies? Lmao, fascism. world conversation. honestly hilarious. think fascism lockdown freedom lockdown? Bro far gone converse with. reason post removed, suppose. ""educators""... Thanks clarification. Also, incredibly outrageously high. ""I regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs,"" Fauci I'm sure see people stupid cant wear masks properly right now. Hospitals running PPE, doctors recycle masks. imagine bad scenario would everyone started panic buying masks. First off, Cytokine Storm. And, worry anyone compares COVID mere paper cut. And, no, lockdowns didn’t work didn’t “true” lockdown US like Italy Germany. “lockdown” equivalent putting toddlers use-over play pens. didn’t work downplaying virus lack leadership. didn’t act one, united country.

I agree suicides spiked, expected highly stressful situation also prolonged poor attempt controlling virus outbreak. hate see everything look like humidity drops air dry, cool fall/winter breezes.

Btw, quit focusing deaths, like gray area. There’s much happening black white. Yep. Average salary nationwide 60k. lowest paying state teachers average 46k. mean, think underappreciated normally also think BS they're treated midst pandemic, saying ""50k almost unheard of"" comical figure that's almost 20% nationwide average lol. Well say 1 10,000 young adults catch covid require ICU, really sound scary. instead need word start people hospitalized. need make sure news never tells full story. little genius arnt  North Korea hardly cases! bountiful food! Supreme Leader superpowers! wish could upvote 100 times. Thank you.  US cases pretty steep slope since July. “More cases good news” - Trump stupid people? read article?

Are idiot? leave part out, right quote. actually almost emphasized it. entire point study presymptomatic asymptomatic spread big drivers infection originally thought, public health policies regarding *healthy people reason believe sick* need adjusted (ie, restrictions lifted) light information. piss poor behavior churches remembered history. Apparently half world population retarded  lifting gym tendies bunched like right now. Depends - city's district starts $51,000 first-year teacher. 

Suburban districts cheaper COL start thousand 

Even rural districts looked counties start low 40s, based 10-month contract. Wow, well I’m super glad made okay (I hope). I’ll try get tested, it’s hard area still find tests.

What worst symptoms may ask?  true lot situations. last bubble plenty financial analysts knew securities looking bubble. income dependent bubble continuing. way predict *when* bubble would pop (too chaotic), reward sticking neck calling bubble would getting chewed out/demoted/shunned/no bonus. hand, valuable rewards continuing wrong way everyone else. want businesses close down? gets NBA finals broadcast...the nba dumpster fire gematria ritualistic decision making wheres link fauci saying public wearing masks.

this man lost credibility me, back march/april 


you downvote make less true. Why? must perform anaerobic exercise. Squatting, dead lifting, bench pressing equipment expensive even afford true problem put them. matter number is, back normal probably gonna claim photo 'staged' vaccine promised. Plenty viruses vaccine. vaccine found, good science require time. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

Holt shit guys, asshole thinks we’ve turned corner even though schools went back. He’s dumb look happened countries already opened schools, like worse worst first peak! totally fucked! ... available US citizens Shout german contact tracing study found 3 55,000+ contact traced cases happened outdoor environments.

[Here’s link study.  ""US"" works US cases. comes culture state, city, possibly even neighborhood. Lol...ok? And? remarks ""deep state"" controls FDA vaccine approvals, using scientific medical criteria, pharma FDA scrambling rebuild confidence vaccine approval process.    

I know done long term objectives mind, order try convince public vaccine approved October done highest standards.    

But, way see it, anti-vaxxer's case made, head executive branch government, talking FDA. Yeah, something I've interested since started: many casual illnesses prevented since we're taking pretty drastic precautions? Colds, flu, etc see fractional infection rates. enjoy years lockdowns end, rates eventually rebound? becauase enough beleive personal right privacy outweigh another person's right life, US continues complete shit show. They're asking people surrender privacy - they're asking deadly illness surrender privacy save lives others. 

If that's epitome American selfish attitude, know is. make 800k/month posting private plane wife sister blow me. 1. casual encounter someone isn’t wearing mask, worried be? work grocery store means even want social distance, sometimes can’t invasive people personal space. Unfortunately, means sometimes people get close. wear mask time social distance much possible. took one test virus tested negative still freaking since know doesn’t mean won’t get all. Basically, long encounter proximity present corona get you?
2. wearing mask protect people you? protect all?
3. face shield? bit provide refuge COVID-19 sufferers rejected marginalised almost every nation. Finally safehaven virus live flourish! obviously **everyone** staying house two weeks possible.

But another essential lockdown like March, nationwide bit tighter (No Lowe's buying non-essemtials Wal-Mart, instance) get us it. We'd still maintain level openness currently vaccine comes. Oh I’ll catch up! I’ll keep gettin reinfected ! suspected, Covid-positive student explained cops yes, told quarantine: that’s hosting party place.

Sure. like don’t know walking third storey window break legs, wearing seatbelt might help car crash, balance evidence seem pretty fucking likely.

It’s 100% effective solutions, things help. preventive measures take, reduce spread virus. masks help. emergency use authorization, EUA, would require company show product may effective. Peter Marks, director FDA’s biologics office, said Thursday agency require robust data well coronavirus vaccine works granting emergency waiver -- something called “EUA said data requirement closely mimic standards apply application regular approval.** Bad analysis. Deaths countries single digits cases doubled April. There’s simpleton analysis. South Park fucking field year 2020. Bergen south west. know? exactly get from, smarty pants? personally contact tracing? kind life lead reckless ""Karen""? maybe married ""Kevin""? throw statistics seen article around. makes lose credibility.

yeah, let's stop vaccine research instead pump us full supplements that, actually, body responsible creating - vitamin hormone kidneys segregate own. except that's good idea, since, left own, body millions caught virus spread around.

so either vaccine - established way stopping diseases long time - trust new study still infancy.

Yah says ""sure masks important"" immediately follows ""we dont need walking around them"" see could get anymore dismissive that. way interpret that. implication really clear, said useless needing without saying verbatim useless needed. comprehension must horrible.

Show video anyone say thinks masks necessary. dont work well. Except aparently retarded. NYC already forgot tragedy March April. Ran sub 17 min 5k high school made State Select Soccer, conference Football.

Basically doctors receive loan forgiveness POINT BLANK PERIOD let's genetically engineer virus, less harmful humans benign, SARS-COVID-2 traits. order bypass research facility containment requirements actual research SARS-COVID-2, hopefully speed research quest find vaccine? 

Sounds like brilliant plan government immediately get involved in. sure exicuted flawlessly transparent manner (that sarcasm case missed it). It’s intermittent I’m worried it. mean flu shot? Or, could, know...manufacture regionally... going homebody, we're gonna house party  number seems suspiciously disturbingly low makes think they’re failing identify infections. 

They identifying infections, identifying people show symptoms enough slightly-above-minimum-wage government employee notice. Passed weeks ago reality probably around 1.5m deaths Genius move..../s need test negative fly US, many travelers cases (all cases?) 1. made comparisons euros. Current exchange rate one grand USD around 845 euros. 2000 euros bartender pull summer comes 2367 dollars.
2. country eurozone yet. use different currency opted Euro since people know is. Hence minimum wage 400 euros german minimum wage 1584 euros, 1875 dollars. So, bartender working worst bar possible still earns 1875 dollars, trust me, people working upscale restaurants earn far, far more. again, get tips top that.
3. finally, illustrate level wage servers country get, here's example comparison. Average wage political representative parliament country 2000 euros, highest wage get 3000 euros. server minimum 1000 euros half year. add tips top that, us make 2000 euros month, wage average highest ranking politician gets, that's servers work upscale restaurants, random tourist traps, servers go hospitality highschool. factor cost living, server working living country probably gets better end deal. multiple sources posted support ICUs filling Italy, healthier younger patients  past week country carried 120,000 tests, 1.3 per cent identified disease. height pandemic proportion 19 per cent.

Excuse me, 1.3% 120,000 tests still 1,560 confirmed infections.

That means Sweden almost many infections ""past week"" New Zealand throughout entire pandemic.

Vindicated? Bullshit.

This article grossly misleading spin. There's definitely delay getting contagious. contagious day symptom onset working parents,,? job pay parents stay home sick children? Agreed I’m saying survey could capture allergies even getting rough night’s sleep. That’s need scientifically peer reviewed study, “surveys”. went Mexico swine flu, took Tylenol plane told us checking temps, send us back US. I'm sure lot people this?? saying right. agreeing symptom checking garbage way screen COVID. No. done prepare covid, considering obese population US is. Obama also there, everyone clapped. Yes something never gets brought Europe shut country, US can't. legally can't stop someone New York traveling Massachusetts, Germany stop travelers Spain.

So control spread nature independent countries.  encourage research (spoiler might animal study there, favourite ;) )

Also, think realize many people live comorbidities even realize it. small heart problems go unnoticed years, still something puts higher risk category. may even comorbiditiy unaware of. Try think outside personal little bubble.  issues I'd like point said.

First, kid thing. anecdote, may (which know amount scientific data I'll include well). two children. oldest 8 months old, contracted common cold-like virus called RSV. ended ICU 5 days. cases, RSV nothing cough mild sniffles. However, 1-2 children 100 catch it, hospitalization required (and i'm saying REQUIRED children need sterioids oxygen support). hospitalized RSV, death rate 0.009%.  RSV super common children infants. ever heard it? heard parents anything children age 1 year (when RSV dangerous) fear may catch RSV?  No, truth people either know risk feel like reward (carrying life) worth risk.  
You posted 2 articles bolster point, written March (when information COVID infancy). I'm saying valid saying information come since then. link week American Academy Pediatrics (which tell valuable source information things kids parents):  states severe reaction death still rare children. Yes, multi system inflammatory reaction happen.  happen variety viruses, COVID.  data link sent you, recent, shows major disparities hospitalization rates children (which assume due wide variety factors, including health child, access care, etc).  point though data showing risk low. rare children get severe reactions die COVID.  like continued live life RSV scare (and scared us much son got 2 months years daughter, heavily freaked otu), doctor told us ""what guys experienced rare. going fine."" Btw, was. calling ""rare"" hospitalized 1-2% rate. states showing hospitalization rates children Covid .3%.  disagree seriously consider actions. 
Now I'm statician may wrong this, 6 million people COVID USA right mean 1 50 chance getting myself. Thats true homogeneous experiment. COVID rates vary WILDLY depending live. Additionally, way get sick matters. wear mask large portion workout. hour im gym, maybe 30 minutes (sometimes little less, sometimes more). amount virus inhale impact severity illness. I'm saying possible get sick. well understand is.  point live area low virus rates, wear mask time I'm least half time gym, chances catching getting severe case reduced. good health, chances getting severely sick ill.  state age nothing getting severely ill, studies read show age impact chances getting severely ill: 

It matter geriatric. matter obese. matter smoke vape. matters hypertension diabetes pulmonary disease. none those. Going gym keeps healthy way can't successfully replicate own. cases go area, may rethink now, chances 1/50 1/25 bad reaction. data simply support that. risk children even lower. There's also much know. There's reports asymptomatic kids coming MIS-C. rare happening. Could covid cause scarring lungs damage heart impact average teen could stop kid ever going pro? solid research yet young virus, there's prospective research heart damage take place even mild cases people elderly. deaths. schools local require children wear masks bus hallways they're classroom they're asked remove them.

Baffling honestly. even bother point? Funnily enough, American Citizens stranded countries pay crazy amounts money come back humanitarian flights. pretty fucked them. new measures? go effect Mon cus virus weekend leave :)

UK bad path awful response recent surge Michigan begins open state beginning June. Crosses 600 deaths per million June 13th 6,013 deaths.

Today: 6,880 deaths. 14% increase.

Same day June, Florida 2,928 deaths.

Today: 12,121 deaths. 313% increase.

Michigan cases 100k.

Florida cases 600k.

Michigan positivity rate: 2.9%.

Florida positivity rate: 13%.

Florida three months prepare shit. still considered epicenter pandemic.

Michigan continues open safely report relative data COVID.

Florida done nothing; reduces testing, hides school data, reports deaths. percentages hospitalized college aged kids obese? Ill probably downvoted question matters. care votes.People care one circle fies..maybe even the.Facts facts.Thank stating truth. Yup. Good luck getting now. embolden countries restrict travel American citizens. screenings nothing anyway. always waste time. I’m sure many people necessity, however 5 year olds definitely mature enough left unsupervised 8 hours day. something terrible happen do, probably not, absolutely anything goes wrong able deal it. bright well adjusted 5 year old wouldn’t feel safe letting repeatedly alone amount time. wasn’t working home right wife also working home would difficult deal situation. study, kind Chinese soft manipulation think is?

And tell ""there way...."", thought would way needed lock down, thought would way 200k dead. thought would way dealing September. New covid-19 deaths, yesterday:

I think that's fair literally testing black hills. live town 20miles sturgis testing option. Sturgis black hills area would cases testing thing push-ups sit-ups still work? help panic /s Made-up stats made-up ""avoid tests""? can't even get building valid test. selected pockets US something end march mean.

texas, florida, alabama, etc... happily burying heads sand late 2 months ago pretending NY/CA problem. they’re 21! one wants spread fear &amp; panic re-opening schools &amp; universities must accompany better measures prevention spread covid. Yeah doctors China whistleblew got reprimanded. 

This happen end December. hospitals closest wet market. infectious disease hospital have. started shipping one hospital December.

There's patients ground December refused shipped quarantine hospital Wuhan docs even agreed back then. seems like lot understand nature contagion. need anyone rebut *your claim.*

You're one making claim, one needs prove it. Canada basically living proof Northeast, West Coast seceded thing, could get dramatically better results Murica. I'll take panic 

This sub nutshell.

I say anything Trump Fox News, I'm sure went immediately. media strive accurately portray reality, saying 'Covid-19 spare young people' misleading best dishonest worst. really relevant, it? know tested positive, lock everyone contact person. pharmaceutical business anymore. stock price. uncle got vaccine China. According news reports, hundred thousands people already taken vaccine CEO claims one infected COVID became seriously sick.

According Uncle, many Chinese leaders already gotten vaccinations...in China CCP leaders given shots, kind know pretty confident effectiveness. Depends country, average Brazilian, Mexican Indian much likely covid American One roommates lifted weights friend Sunday. friend tested positive yesterday, developed fever. close proximity roommate Sunday/Monday. Monday night, visited grandma. chance roommate could’ve contracted within day seeing friend, given within day, ultimately give Grandma? usually delay getting able easily spread it? says data dump

Look Canada's numbers see actual data dump looks like. thread full wise men women one listening. It’s pretty easy determine based data. Sure, it’s 100%, seeing increased rate strokes general population year, guarantee lift due covid. It’s math. It’s hard. risk doubles roughly every 6 years. risk 10x every 20 years.

Everyone risk factors every disease activity life. Halving here, doubling tripling there, normally balances out.

A 10x 100x difference really starts make difference.

In Netherlands, nobody 50 died since June. nobody wears masks, never either. Blame Canada like local people pay full tuition. In-state residents lower costs. staters pay full tuition too. stop testing, boom! Disappears like miracle! vaccine flu. Almost everyone flu least once. flu centuries. plenty research. corona novel. hasnt even year.

Once safe effective vaccine out. going go back normal. 

It's due novelty. People immunity it. millions people get sick health care cannot cope people die due lack health care treatment. USA diverse nation who's citizens family members world want visit them. travellers see statue liberty  think 20% students it? 20% crazy crazy high. point need lock everyone rooms three days next test comes back, send yet home. ""Hey honey, perfume smell good?""

""Oh shit sorry Dear, 3:45pm can't smell anymore day."" goal death? infect everyone die November 3rd. mean? teachers get pensions anymore. Board Supervisors county next door, Placer, voted lift countywide emergency declaration week. Basically, they've said state wants mandates, enforce Placer County. 

They're crazy hills, tell ya! Calling bullshit this. disease circulating December *to extent excess patients noticed emergency rooms*, means existed last month before. Pandemics start slow. surge indeed COVID related (I HUGE doubts) must thousands cases L.A. overall time. That's least month outbreak, there's way around (it's math). that's case, time CA L.A. noticed put restrictions March, would circulating unimpeded 3 1/2 months least. everyone's susceptible, that's millions cases, thousands deaths unrecorded, circling herd immunity already (in March!). buy it. 36.8 + 24.5 total 61.3% obese 36% total obese 24% total morbid? 

I ask obesity rate America 39.8% per CDC. puts numbers context way more. 39.8% adults obese hospitalizations obese COVID cases 36.8%, seems like obesity significant risk factor, least point.

EDIT: checked. It’s thought. Obesity significant risk factor covid become morbid. rates obesity hospitalized covid patients slightly lower rates obesity general population. Even lower consider there’s morbidly obese young middle aged adults old adults (because old obese people die sooner). I’m sure you’re pushing narrative 20lbs even 50lbs overweight significant it’s not. 

And say someone who’s 10lbs overweight healthy BMI.

To get even technical undercut point even more: regular obesity (BMI 30-39) associated much increased risk based numbers JAMA article. subtract morbid non-morbid obese patients find 12% hospitalized young people study BMI range 30-39. 

The CDC estimates 6% people morbidly obese. America 39.8% obese, safely subtract say 33.8% America BMI 30-39. 

So 33.8% young people population thereabouts, represented 12% hospitalizations. Doesn’t seem scary ask me.

But relatively moot paper targeted specific cases there’s lot bias goes that. swing state less political capital enforce this. swing county, sheriffs actively say enforce mask mandates. 

The rot starts topic. use whatever number works agenda 

As in, using total historical case count make point US worse India \*right now\*?

I used direct source clarified. point people using hyperbolic maxims dismiss anything comes short putting US extremely negative framing. See: entire thread subthread. unambiguous try prove US actually best covid refuge sort charts right. Sturgis modeled possibly contribute many 250,000 cases . direct confirmed link, theoretical number. Wat raising white flag? see makes sense. like unified videogame faction something, singular goal. acts terrorism world target much less visible, accessible, places. Buses, trains, etc.

If terrorist goal disrupting peace, causing chaos discomfort general populous way put pressure government whatever, there's reason go long airport queue instead plane. Ah yes, privacy invasions right privacy overriden public good. That's anything protecting people unwarranted searches oh wait do. interesting mainly starting see conclusive ""proof"" community transmission occuring people China late 2019 (see case reported UK week lung tissue tested). mean fam nasty sickness around holidays Covid-19, however, certainly need trace back dates test samples able. Cause math also ""no masks = libs owned"" Holy mischaracterization Batman.  maybe maybe focus response coronavirus taking best possible measures protect population rather LARPing response disinfecting groceries making kids eat school snacks outside facing away other.  can't critique anything sub without instantly accused ""killing grandma"". fuck gonna do? Hire entirely new staff teachers growing teacher tree? Policies like completely unenforceable numbers. article August details age hospitalization became 29/30 50/60 start reason local governments can't contain virus we're still living hangover government's attempt downplay spring. 

If Trump came put force support masks social distancing give local groupies political capital control diehard supporters, we'd quash thing month. Considering many asymptomatic cases shared symptoms viruses, would foolish believe quietly circulating world China ever realized new virus all. really simple. may anecdotal enough anecdotal cases show something healthy people shake off.

Anecdotally friend got mild-moderate symptoms. Went gym 3 times week ate well. COVID negative 3 months said needs inhaler still gets winded easily trying exercise.

Healthy people might die, mean can't serious, lasting, long term effects. Lower voter turnout almost always benefits Republicans. foreigner, reading news Corona chaos, police violence, gun laws, wars countries, school shootings, prescription drug abuse, lack social security health insurance, sounds like US government trying kill many people possible.  headline, yes think NFL rolling back policy allowing fans? Maybe quarter state pretty. republican. Noem gonna make 2024 run. ...CA seceded closed borders. can't bothered give fuck feds think since actively trying cause negligent deaths massive scale. really reprogram Plague Inc accurate people always fight virus reality care billionaires making money No. Isolated home , online school. Sounds like undoing damage downplaying done top man record downplayer. I'll take panic blissful ignorance virus, even though like choose.  risking anything. ""countering"" naive absurdities fantasy world. debate sub, economic debate sub. still yet offer counters fact EU, maybe Japan UK well, might approve vaccine US month.

You get power works...


It's REALLY hard discussion face closed ego. know likes you, shown naive you? Grew environment got gold star matter need better grasp reality. got countered defend ego means necessary. Honesty window.. REEEE TRUMP WANTS KILL US ALL

protip: got plane fever high enough spotted thermal cam, you’ve infected shitload people Yup, r/coronavirus, land privileged.  monthly expenses 6k 13k.

Or work seasonal/commission based job need get low season.

Or maybe saving house payment. Or, know they’ll screened, pop couple ibuprofen acetaminophen fever suppressed time get work. It’s trick people used desperate get plane borders closed knew pass temperature screening so.

I don’t know Covid feels know fever tell - feel awful. someone chooses go work fever probably know one can’t won’t stay home. point literally article sent? Broad range studies there, kind inconclusive. 28% vs 19%. guess really studied certain degree yet. Temperature checks absolutely useless IMO catch one specific type case. Better nothing tell scientific consensus personal observations coming conclusion fever good indicator CoViD infection even good indicator severity cases. thought infallibility western medicine culture. sure primitive eastern countries can't keep up. forgot advanced US medical society 20 40 years ago lost forgotten thing. ""It says article contracted Covid students returned school."" 

I missed that. Thank you.

So, contracted COVID kids got back, Covid nothing School...

Seems like wonky article. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.
