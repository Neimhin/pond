Whether agree not, obviously guy's opinion informed one. Maybe interpret data differently, discuss instead side stepping everything put together? someone said 335 children would die course 18 months almost one would honestly worried changed behavior way. Extremely. fully vaccinated 80% adults Pfizer vaccine, [this basically got herd immunity month dropped almost restrictions. 

Then Delta outbreaks started schools, students vaccinated, kicked mini-wave exposed holes vaccine's protection, either Delta general.

It's still spreading way would unvaccinated adult population, obviously, test case whether country could vaccinate way herd immunity vaccinating adults. answer is, ""before Delta, yes, after, no."" proof western countries fucked up, making seem imoressive. People meet 2 months, food delivered, everyone thought deadly time, think virus would spread

I've clubbing every weekend 2 years probably contact hundreds thousands people everyone else know single person even knows anyone covid country Oxford study shows brain damage even mild cases.  wonder get transplant Mr vaccine could get two She‚Äôs Kansas City. insane amount otherwise seemingly intelligent people Missouri hesitant position family. That‚Äôs one reason state 39% vaccination rate. Ironic used scarce resources (lungs) could implanted someone else. Someone actually vaccines. wonder organ donors request covidiots get them. Great line. Can't see expecting see breakdown Great Ring Leap SNAFU 2019 r/coronavirus, kind day we've had, I'm mad it. Good question, almost impossible trace secondary effects 1,000 people. 

How many mutations another good question. takes one young, vaccinated individuals produce potent variant.


The real point 1000 cases contributing much larger problem. Yea long people dumb forever üò£  got vaccinated, hopeful could lead somewhat normal life (going restaurants, concerts, etc.). we‚Äôre right back thick it, even vaccine.  clearly case ridiculous. Also hear people sub tell it, every single person know got long covid. real life yet meet single person long covid, spoken anyone knows someone has. course people get extremely sick, especially point hospitalization may lingering issues. idea people never symptoms suddenly months long issues silly. Truly. confidence people peddle anti vax logic make excuses forever restriction claiming pro vax. Never anything backed data course. pure crazy aunt Facebook post logic. imagine that‚Äôs due cough mucus. it‚Äôa silly imply less worried kids don‚Äôt cough.  Kids 12 exempt long parents fully vaccinated. know you‚Äôve likely heard best thing take break Covid news pre-studies. Particularly tend overthink, it‚Äôs death spiral worrying info, pointless worry about. positive news 18 months started, basically protected serious impacts. Despite case rises, things getting much better terms deaths hospitalizations you‚Äôve vaccinated. effective vaccine soon pandemic began miracle thankful for.  Well chances danger vaccine one million.

With covid is? one thousand, depending age/condition. doesnt include long covid, people still handicapped months after, fun experience spending week hospital respiratory assistance.

In case, take god damn vaccine. way spin stats say advantage taking it. Well, first would like thank sacrifices made nightmare. I'd like tell world lot bigger ICU. hospitals region 60% buy Covid vaccines nursing homes issue. None 8 employees vaccinated. Today able convince two get vaxxed. doctors office building, plenty supply coordinating get shots without drive anywhere. One employees car relies public transit.

However, leaves rest 6 employees still unaccounted for. think get 3rd one last 5 hard. Two months ago meeting regarding vax everyone time said no. fits Public Health England's latest estimates: 96% vs delta current vaccine spread (approx 60/40 AZ/Pfizer, plus million Moderna also) clarified, sorry?  find implausible outbreak would produce cases, matter hard crack stamp outbreak.

There may things going on, e.g. likely resistance SARS-like viruses regions, China's neighbors also able control better world (or recently, anyway). doubt chalked things like masks, contact tracing, even borders. 

But think cover major outbreak, massage numbers outbreaks small enough stamped out.

Basically, see China's numbers believe numbers low, possible alternative fall conspiracy rabbit hole. believe good controlling virus claim, one could be. starting sharp rises hospitalizations. know many itnwill hit peak. 

I agree ratio cases hospitalizations . many hospitalizations, lower rational, still depend many infections are. Delta contagious could still get pretty darn high. across Irish sea, we're arguing happen indoor dining. understanding covid spreads much easily symptomatic people, likely adults. Great point! Yeah agree sounds pretty bad. California would comparable somewhere ike Bangladesh Bolivia inequalities issues like that. given statistic want, flip-flopped calling credibility play (**in eyes**), deepened 'numbers lies' narrative.

Absolute mess around. understanding it‚Äôs immune system actually becomes stronger (for adults least, different children), body develop least partial immunity different virus strains.

So exposed brand new strain virus, whether you‚Äôve social distancing not, immune response similar. likely encountered similar strain recently about. Some

Which expected vaccine effectiveness 88% Thanks.  find comfort data still seems high unknown Well, least almost legitimate excuse unlike everyday assholes around us. athletes train entire lives shot even making olympics. one, maybe two games able sustain training regimens needed qualify. some, could easily last games. 

I‚Äôm fully defending means, Olympic Committee Japan think it‚Äôs safe still hold games absolutely see they‚Äôd still participate. It‚Äôs selfish Olympic Committee Japan still hold games, athletes hands kinda tied here. lot people dealing emotional aspect last 18-19 months, don‚Äôt hard yourself. you‚Äôre really worried sets ease, wear mask. mentioned above, you‚Äôre safe ever be. 

I think would beneficial see friend two, especially since sound eager so. You‚Äôll fine.  I‚Äôve working Covid ICU since start every single one us happily got jab December minute came available. highly doubt many others exposure we‚Äôve seen seen said: thanks. found two lungs fucking fast? right match?. hope one got skipped over. I'm pretty introverted usually means recharge myself. cjust get exhausted lot interaction. I'm SURE shutin Agreed, also true vaccine. Let's say goalie hockey team, played 100 games single shot goal 100 games. Would blame goalie (or team) saying trust defense need goalie?  Well people go clubs for... Yep, Pfizer. can, it‚Äôs far less likely to. That‚Äôs whole point vaccine. still get it, probably won‚Äôt probably mild. wanted wait years see, know, there‚Äôs side effects anything it,

He's vaper worries health consequences taking vaccine? lol.

What waste! lungs gone someone everything possible preserve health, someone flouts rules.

Can talk ER priority?

If vaccines, available everyone US, get vaccine, wear masks, priority limited resources (lungs, ventilators, oxygen, medical care etc...) lung issues year, cough needed codeine allow sleep 2 years calmed down, although still cough like smoked cigarettes (never have) day well decade later. 


I developed autoimmune diseases within 3 months flu despite never issues before, violent coughing throwing left hernias ended almost killing decade later treated (we imaging showing 2 months flu, never told since focus imaging, found digging medical files developed hernias, emergency hernia surgery 2019). therapy last 5 years dingus Urgent care seems packed went Friday, first place LA went around 3-4 hour wait. second place went took around 2-3 hours looked at. kaiser urgent care. everyone required, everyone disadvantage days downtime.  they've made almost effort prioritize vaccinations among youth. 

 still deal issues supply.  16 yr old went hospital lifting twice weight 6 days jab. It‚Äôs also reason Singapore advising anyone taking jab wait 2 weeks exercise. Here's scientific experiment you. Schedule appointment reputable therapist (im sure find one zooms). Tell avoided social contact 16 months fear. Tell therapist otherwise healthy doubly vaccinated still looking ways cement paralyzing fear. 

What might therapist say? many hospitalisations? many vaccinated young vulnerable narrative really needs move on...  damn point taking vaccine?

To get sick die?


If could actually trust people follow rules could unvaccinated mask obviously that‚Äôs gonna happen. 

Unlike average redditor, government health agencies hospitals don‚Äôt get say ‚Äòtough shit‚Äô people won‚Äôt get vaccinated end sick hospitalized. still take steps curb spread. misspelled ‚Äúare‚Äù like Hockey team saying need goalie, trust defense.

I'd say like Stanley Cup Champions saying need goalie playing team 5 year old kids. It‚Äôs note though study didn‚Äôt include Delta, hopefully trend childeen Yeah, brother wife got COVID April, recommended 10 days quarantine them. According doctor, 10 days recommended mild cases. 
 
Although stayed quarantine that, stayed symptoms 16 days. 

Better take care risk it.

Brazil btw. Oh.... true one asked olympics happens anyway‚Ä¶ says man (purposeful liar) immediately broke lockdown rules forced UK words completely worthless COVID didn‚Äôt get less deadly. also got infectious. Hence target level vaccination changed. Hey Trumps playbook? ""Slow testing down"" demographic going clubbing recently got first. protect other? die? part civilization? wearing mask really debilitating you? covid forever Like vaccines, getting sick? Open, cost $500 get family tested US side get tested Canada side too, can't even figure much cost us. Travel testing covered insurance. still mostly closed unless money burn.  this? What‚Äôs operating number?  UK data using questionable techniques good data. example, guessing variant people based prevalent particular area, applying Alpha variant age filters Delta variant Delta looks like worse young people tha Alpha. read lot Reddit, trained expert understand viruses propagate. We've known viruses work well hundred years. really fucking simple. 

The viral load allow thrive inside body, they're going reproduce. means every time breathe, letting virus world. 100 ""virus units"" blown breathe, interact world ways, that's fuckton better 100,000 ""virus units"" shed body.

The vaccine teaches body kill ""virus units,"" even still present body, enough 'invade' someone else's body, overpower defenses.

Having ability take vaccines combat viruses fucking miracle first place, lots us would already dead viruses plagued world centuries. 

Fight invaders, let overrun homeland make own, reproducing taking peoples' homes. really simple. Sounds good! well appreciate help dont wanna disagree read says 30% usual. yes, im overthinker. thought would find reassurance here. anyway. thanks help. appreciate it. shit anti vaxxers anti maskers. worship worldly, cultured travelers. dont spread variants. source said testing program employees would resume changes public health guidance local national officials. pandemic, large portion country's population moved online shopping following lockdowns curb spread virus, Amazon benefited it. Information first report news Monday, citing note circulated internal company app. I'll see month athlete died covid olympics. vaccinated they? ‚Äúdoomsayer‚Äù wearing mask? 

I think people pushing reinstate masks ones want thing most. certainly do. 

The fastest way returning normalcy year ago follow protocol. living consequences bunch idiots following protocol. So, what‚Äôs stance? following protocol‚Ä¶ Totally childish IMO, past year proof cannot close eyes, ignore issues hope go away. 

If ‚Äúdoomsayer‚Äù would likely encourage everyone get vaccinated, use masks, etc., things kept us ‚Äúdoomed‚Äù. Marketing? cold medicines labelled ""Cold Flu"" - probably leading people think interchangeable. That's Pfizer right? I'm curious Astra Sino vaccines now. comment removed allow safety medical advice sub. Please contact doctor starting new dietary regimen, includes vitamins supplements.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Sorry struggled‚Äîyou aren‚Äôt alone. Long Covid risk basically nil fully offensive, also accurate experience. people half brain could use interpretation understand section statement referring to, alas, longer handle ignorance bow out, good sir. Best luck athletes countries hope best problems. spread virus serious implication mutation virus. Look Delta came instance effectiveness vaccines reduce mutation. 
My main worry point allow virus mutate large scale aggressively might get point vaccine can‚Äôt keep even worst children might get seriously sick. guess time tell Less 0%. also clearly value incorrect conclusions daughters Olympic career. unqualified jobs publicly known. Probably aren‚Äôt old enough vote /s Doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt carry pass on. need ban permanently. keeps comparing getting vaccinated holocaust. People work Mcdonalds parents literally qualified jobs. waves. booster shots likely needed. 

This stay. Ontario better position say UK said:

""If now, when?"" actually something talked daily thread science sub, r/covid19. percentage people hospital much lower percentage people vaccinated, shows effective vaccines are. 100% vaccinated, everyone hospital would vaccine. yes, people vaccinate, vaccinated people see hospital. 

I didn‚Äôt really think way first, looking numbers quick math, see effective vaccines are.  one, sad. library couple weeks ago, someone walked time me. pulling vaccine card show employees, said ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt need see that‚Äù went back doing. Soo even though sign says unvaccinated people must still wear masks, don‚Äôt actually care. preconceived notion older white people vaxxed higher rate blacks whole younger white people. think agree. I'm huge fan essential oils. take right combination first sign incoming cold, back full health next day.

That said, essential oils ever seen preventative supplementary option, alternative medication (and vaccines). response mothers mention would ""why both?"" I‚Äôd 100% rather government mandate vaccination begin lose right free speech this. Lol username going it? Get man Mission Accomplished banner booking Four Seasons Landscaping &amp; Covid testing. can't pay almost funding comes Federal government state government. tell much pay employees. acuity based staffing. Mask live bunkers next decade safe. way repeal EMTALA let hospitals turn away. Humans rationalize reject evidence eyes see long already latched onto belief ahead time. Maybe play politics, rather disseminate scientific guidance (you know job).

It backfired stated masks effective order prevent mask shortages health care workers. anti-maskers trust advice. fueled fire.

It's backfiring newer studies showing 70-80% vaccine effectiveness delta variant, far stretch 95% informing guidance masks social distancing longer required vaccination.

I expect sensibility actual epidemiologists. last comment got removed masks annoying pisses people already get vaccinated. much easier get private sector make totally unlivable without vaccinated. Jack insurance premiums remove unvaccinated. Make employers fire unvaccinated. sure, legal vaccinated, can't go anywhere make money. Yes n95s still allow 5% in. point 5% comes (Delta whatever variant comes next) much infectious. Takes much less viral load establish infection. Effectively making n95 ""n85"" speak. understand Japan low vax rate maybe give read try calling anti vaxer craziness let‚Äôs split society crap.   interesting thanks, seem alarming though me. Definitely deaths, expected. Metrics apparently Feb 1 - June 21 2 deaths fully vaccinated people age 50 naturally/unfortunately lot people 50. give info Praise Nurgle blessed plagues *cough hack cough* assumed unvaccinated longer want wear mask. know say assume‚Ä¶ problem world it. 

You raised dragon released wild, put back cage more.  think understand coming Night. fears. Lymes Diseases years ago never same. long term diseases illness tear us time. severe depression, lost half eye sight, body feels like I'm 80 thought Covid attacking part body freighting. Especially years initial infection. think makes worse us medical field fully know happen us. know yet feel anger frustration people tell everything fine get vaccine (and people spell right, spelling x's diminishes word). hope find people discuss problems soon see. also find bit irritating news articles revolve around vaccines Covid infections.

I understand medical community &amp; governments want people feel safe regards getting vaccines can't stop speaking Covid effects bodies. \~ found decent article speaking someone infected Covid-19 early 2020 recently? fear injustice people.

\~ try reading articles : non bias (as one guess) revolve around American politics. get it, making people mask again. pisses people get vaccinated. insurance allowed jack premiums drop completely, job allowed fire you, denied entry highly populated dense public spaces without proof vaccination. Child protective services allowed take kids. wanna live woods bubble, go it. Otherwise unvaccinated untenable. vaccines developed, trialed, authorized premise preventing symptoms. time anything predicated ability prevent infections. Notice vaccines called labeled marketed covid-19 vaccines sars-cov-2 vaccines; meant prevent disease first foremost.

Efficacy mete infections important long three unvaxinated populations vaccinated people spread to:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†kids eligible
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Immunocompromised
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Idiots declined  CDC says it‚Äôs fine.  anti vaxxers homeland security threat treated wife still wear masks go store despite vaccinated kids old enough kind trend making even worse. ridiculous amount passive aggressive behavior aimed every time wear one local gas station, grocery store, etc. great living rural area there's less people around spread ratio ignorant common sense rough pill swallow.  No, they're fully vaccinated. Article stated counting ""vaccinated"" anyone least one shot prior show. could get vaxxed day get in. US younger population, better vaccines. Also us regionize COVID rise unvaccinated Pretty much. I've accepted year ago. tons risks exposed daily. another one. Got live life best process. Honestly point blame politicians. asshole politicians reason people getting vaccinated. hope someday late keep Delta.

But stuffing people tube five hours (nevermind happens destination) still bad idea, would remain even infection rates variants ends trip.

Half problem things done stayed home community. Naw Across pond Korea watching everything going ‚Ä¶ can't believe they're going much public outcry. love Olympics highlight year really can't bring watch now. Hope co. stay safe   USA: ehhhh, count us then. vaccinated person still get virus transmit right? young children also need tested?  Maybe non-vaccinated athletes shouldn‚Äôt go Olympics. one think hand?? would work? government requiring get vaccinated certainly could charge vaccinated. highly doubt state like Louisiana would never make law. reason along Mississippi Alabama finish last everything. Thank explanation pooled testing. lot countries discussed ideas mass testing, rapid testing, etc. seemed abandon, perhaps political ability make worth people's participate testing (e.g. guaranteeing lose money test positive stay home China's ""oriental"" neighbours largely societal roots Chinese societal traditions community individual, common factor could sway it.

Perhaps, though lot trouble believing importance cultural differences, part takes people screw everyone (so even 90% people valued community individual, 10% would enough ruin everything). That's kind inferred I've read. sure, whatever works. bottom line % basis, likely survive jumping plane without parachute dying covid fully vaccinated. Especially mRNA vaccine. This. even field chaps vast majority people need care overworked, appreciated healthcare workers refused vaccine. Brazil high acceptance rate vaccines long time, 90% always, rate vaccination moment stops there's shots city. probably drugged know third grade teacher. knew lie cuz there‚Äôs good floor window action had. nightstand also looks promising. bed, challenge could also hot. Honestly never knew stupid gullible people past couple years politics exposes them. supposed unvaccinated. enforcement there. think Or... part multi-pronged strategy including masks distancing. Getting vaccinated reduces risk. provide 100% immunity, even everyone board. Right now, can't even get half country vaccinated. smartest thing would lockdown, US never smartest thing. thing keeps stock market making money one percent whatever mollifies people guns. insanity. n85 would allow 15% penetration particles 0.3 microns larger.

The mask filter efficacy change virus potent. one - quantitative study I've seen, shows actual measurable grey matter loss.

Qualitative studies nitpicked handwaved away. think hard argue though. 70% far higher 51% take vaccine worry covid.

‚Ä¶ infecting close you, incubator next strin COVID-19. Yeah vote vacuum dude. voters denied pandemic ever issue, continue malign public health officials, refuse take vaccine. guess sort people vote for? People pander sensitivities. people dont get vaccinated lol. making excuses obvious tin foil hat maniac.  going work nursing home minimum wage. think much it. Hmmm, well live toxic hellhole Florida, county's vaccination rate decent 69% residents 12 least one shot. record numbers tourists town, there's also that. couple days remotely questioning particular situation vaccine protection.  People forget many people 40% unvaccinated is.

Also, r0 goes up, threshold herd immunity. 

With virulent delta variant, may take 85%+ total population vaccinated ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù take effect now. We‚Äôre close pretty much anywhere. nursing home workers make minimum wage. doubt find people replace them.  also adds precedent repeat offenses might result longer suspensions anti-rejection meds rest life. Probably lots follow-up visits transplant team pulmonologists. Hope parents looking drug coverage plan. Fair enough. I'll never argue decent Americans who've done due diligence. They've earned right choose now. unvaccinated options now. longer obligated protect options get vaxxed. vaxxed person chooses go extra extra mile. someone got one - actually 3 combined app. get tested register test phone test result show app long valid. 

You also register beeing immunized covid + 1 shot 2 shots wothout infected Yes do. 90% over-50 population vaccinated. Over-50 accounts almost hospitalizations. vaccination rate approaches 100%, hospitalization percentage. Well don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs hopeless it‚Äôs still pretty effective people get infected vaccinated fine. 40,000 cases UK 25 deaths even surge US death haven‚Äôt increased much 6 months People free go also even mask needed. He's also taken pair lungs people non preventable diseases languish waiting lists. Given seems like covid regularly lasting damage people's lungs, I'd expect say Olympic athlete REALLY want avoid covid... basically required. yes, guy anti-rejection meds rest life, significantly weaken immune system. going wrap head around fact needs responsible health, he's good gone. elect politicians make policies hire scientists. course worry it. another loony deza thread. parents didn‚Äôt say no, gave choice, 

It may actually simple. gymnasts grow abusive environments might really choice. someone lives Missouri, trust say morale crushed long time ago Yup, killing kids immunocompromised fine. goal eradication Covid-19, feel CDC would consistent: implement every preventative measure possible disease cleared.

With goal flattening curve, restrictions shift back forth occupancy rates hospitals. Oh didn‚Äôt know that. hope athletes coaches safe. uhh...yes. goalposts moving? curve stay flat enough people developed immunity stop massive transmission covid hospitals overloaded. hard figure out. Biles. turn sure don‚Äôt use hares?  eVeRyThInG fInE HuMaN hUmAn TrAnSmIsSiOn

and How, argument? Yep, 18 year old nice developed asthma first time getting COVID went college. Mild heart damage too! Yea conclusions re: herd immunity incorrect professional estimates need 70-80% fully vaccinated whole community (including children) , adults. 

Along lines, Israel still ways herd immunity, delta guess I‚Äôm bitter told media everything ‚Äúback normal‚Äù got vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt worry infecting co-workers, friends, family. Yes, things better, still far normal. Downvoters like face reality Finally. Hope open Hong Kongers next facilitate exodus people without BNO know anyone voted brexit yet majority country apparently did. wrong social circles.  small instances Delta variant infecting people gotten (Pfizer) vaccine. 

I seen measurements /why, maybe there's variable like weekend immune system, overweight, age. Probably enough people see correlation.

You still want wear mask, outside open air fine vaccinated passing people. definitely want wear mask indoors groups people.
The vaccine designed attach system white blood cells attack prongs virus. Allowing virus pass you. absolutely right new boss old boss... yep. historians archivists authors future. Agreed. hard hear kids masks. I'm sure point making cells. Yes know exist lol. Natural immunity lasting long really unexpected considering that's immunity usually works. I'm saying quality may differ, there's studies on.


I'd interested reading source second paragraph. possible want avoid allergic reactions vaccine ingredients. 


What know vaccine effective new variants, seen (though correct I'm wrong) studies natural immunity new variants. natural immunity could worse vaccine immunity: way immune system works always target ""important"" antigen. likely people antibodies antigens spike protein, cleared virus way. less ideal considering anything specific spike protein risk outcompeted virus mutated non-essential antigen. Here's source showing non-spike protein antibodies effective variants: also concept called original antigenic sin could make even natural antibodies spike protein less effective vaccine immunity depending part spike protein targets. cut ways, making one individual's immunity stronger vaccine immunity, asked ways natural immunity *could* worse. point is, there's plenty ways natural immunity could worse vaccine immunity, take vaccine case? There's mechanism (as far know) could harm you, like override previous immunity.

I mean whole comment comes caveat I'm convinced there's compelling reason take vaccine, I'd gladly proven wrong. far I've heard ""don't take maybe need it"". PS5 variant

Half Life 3 variant Futile, brainwashed Anti-Vaxxers dismiss ‚Äúfearmongering‚Äù ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù ‚Äúhurr durr 99.8% Survival Rate‚Äù I've watched 3 movies train dragon think handle use Alpha-1 use Alpha Alpha Alpha Beta truly sad. lot due certain faction US Television news that's heavily consumed....they push counter-narrative. completely agree you. dumb sensationalism. Every person going olympics fully vaccinated. Seems simple enough. Report said asymptomatic.

It‚Äôs going pretty moronic year people slowly start realize vaccines prevent whole thing Covid causing, namely potentially serious illness. certain point, it‚Äôs going irrelevant vaccinated individual tests positive. 

At point, vaccines fully available world, time say Covid over. Mangkhut variant appreciate that. I'm much better now. I'm tired frozen time due covid. I've waiting I'm tired it. Yeah exactly, people want wait locally low case count, well things change rapidly (just look Netherlands Taiwan). way numbers start climbing, it'll late since takes time get doses reach full immunity. Plus sudden rise case numbers cause mass panic it'll much harder get vaccinated quickly. People much foresight unfortunately. free Walgreens. come back Canada last week. Stop complaining. I‚Äôm loving responses lol means ones replace less experienced. This. Thank you. I‚Äôm right ya. Please give one clear example CDC actually giving sound timely advice since beginning pandemic. I‚Äôd love hear it.

They‚Äôve utter failure, put weight anything say point. Never said that. thing makes Covid deadly spike protein. massive mutation spike protein many immunologists believe would make less deadly instead deadly. news water wet.  don‚Äôt understand we‚Äôre surprised Covid still spreading, even among vaccinated. vaccine meant prevent vaccinated person getting severely sick/dying Covid- prevent getting Covid all. Oh no....anyway. It‚Äôs binary. much normal life return to. There‚Äôs parts need restricted cases control. lol one post says we're entering third wave, we're entering fourth shit moving quick days  Singapore, another country lot testing contacts including asymptomatic contacts, reports 69% efficacy vs infection Delta (2 doses Pfizer/Moderna). Efficacy vs symptomatic infection That's good observation. would interpret mean could day zero second dose -- waiting time. Since specified wait time first dose assume specifying 2nd dose means track that. Also might interesting effect skewing data since &lt;21 days smallest time window collect samples from, 2 dose window stretches infinity (well realistically months given wide access vaccines). Although greatest number cases occurred days dose 1 group. naturally shift 2 dose group time. statement data collection method vaccine efficacy. get federal judge approve though. Better getting struck down. least huge precedent whole country now. Seriously. vaccines went college. It‚Äôs do. don‚Äôt get opposition. Ugh. Can't trust CDC Actually would shut freeway anyone playing traffic üôÑ Im saying vaccinated wear masks

good thing cdc huh?  getting covid owns libs. I'm vaccinated though. Im saying vaccinated wear masks Tucker ""Vaccinated Anti-Vaxxer"" Carlson God exist Yeah, wear seat belt instead wearing it.. Since plenty supply area, aiming Friday see. plan give PTO needed. second shot bad JJ. 55% working nursing homes vaccinated... 

What percentage Hispanic? 

What percentage black?

And, separately, percentage religiously committed? mean **perfectly** shutting borders impossible since would import stuff then...

But seriously, people living developed parts world, vaccines privilege, right. reject vaccine today cry given developing part world instead ventilator. Well that's price pay delaying infections. _Everyone_ gets RSV point, optimize get it. wearing mask really hard you? understand part thank you, people act like wearing mask muzzled. Israel counts people vaccinated they've prior covid infection...? also still die wearing seatbelt.  West Hollywood highest case rate county fyi. people mingling. Santa Monica Blvd WeHo packed weekends. people interacting. ways spread. Try 

Though notice area switched Pfizer Moderna ago. sure why. Walmart Clean Aisle 5. Bezos now? We've got new overlord cases close previous peak still rising, combined complete reopening today, we're nos definitely gonna know vaccines real deal (spoiler alert: are) much delta spread supposed go apologize governor again? know. Dr said vaccine helped. GE shit company work for. Vaccines made available persons would travel Olympics, paid Olympic committee/host nation. anything keeping everyone vaccinated.  says everyone dying. specify terminally I'll.  Appreciate response least.  Considering required meningitis vaccines 30 years... presumptive assume lived experienced loss. Shame anonymous internet person! I‚Äôm wearing mask can‚Äôt remember touch face. that‚Äôs best think I‚Äôm going call one Mr. Asshole. Depends look it.

Regardless transmittability nearly everyone get Covid eventually aren‚Äôt vaccinated. increased transmissibility means get end game quicker. Covid vaccine, two choice. 

Obviously, hospitals get overwhelmed math changes, enough prior infections don‚Äôt see happening. know much think 2 year old wear mask effectively day. looked up, see UK, what's source look up? seems like they're obscuring actual numbers purpose. know 30% cases children. say, 4 children total hospitalized hundreds thousands cases, parents could stop stressing much. 85% adults vaccinated happen many places. UK already still increasing.

The problem need 85% _immunity_ vaccine reduces transmission ~80% means need 106% vaccine coverage herd immunity (aka, happen without natural infections). Absouletely, whole large number politicians care people. want votes, money, again. reason fighting global warming. good, would better sooner. really surprised 5 us friend group tested positive, including me. 3 us gnarly symptoms. I‚Äôm steroids right now. Even vaccination, it‚Äôs cold. pretty bad. literally nothing else, wearing mask reminds touch face. Surely agree that. would worth me. mask chain around ankles grow kiddo. clearly never experienced loss life seems like statistic behind keyboard  vaccine: incredibly minute chance getting side effects might affect performance.

Side effects go away days. Right. saying need distance less time around others incur likelihood infection Delta original strain. one ever think that. best go back 6' 15 min rule thumb assuming ""just safe."" 

Yea heard case. always occurrence someone walks right infected persons plume right time infectious air stays face etc. symptoms initial infection, started showing damage later. cardiologist said lot patients experience. There's basically way full outbreak happen Olympic Village.

Based consistently hearing many condoms get used Olympic Village every Olympics, high list diseases paired ""outbreak"" regarding Village.  Basically **"" know covid numbers going up, week gonna ravage warehouses, we're gonna change thing government demands ""**  


Remember Bezos believe work-life balance thinks harmonious circle live Amazon die Amazon. world away Indiana now. Indiana GOP tolerates IU beyond me. This. Family member went ER yesterday afternoon broken foot, waited 5 hours leaving. someone next even longer much serious injuries. nuts.

Also, taking shutting elective surgeries again. selfish fucks get vaccinated.  Please ELI5 results. US PCR tests even travel covered lot insurance plans (I didn‚Äôt pay got mine) Hospitalizations really take much, patients spend lot time strained healthcare everywhere, average death 16 days infection, I'm pretty sure average admission hospital less week Shocking. people know refuse vaxed used termed ""hard shell"". reasons religious antagonistic authority. One showed article one person die J&amp;J recently news. officious beliefs. 

The problem becoming ill societal price resources wealth. 

Facetiously, hand 12 pack hydroxychloroquine like vaccine came last week though. move arm couple days due pain, back April. Athletes plenty time valid excuse. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed; tested positive along 4 friends (all vaxxed). gnarly symptoms steroids nasty cough I‚Äôve week. Sucks man. B cells aren‚Äôt thing memory, cells exist well. immune system robust studies keep coming pointing toward long lasting natural immunity. 

As turns out, antibodies vaccine natural immunity differ well. antibodies slightly different that‚Äôs use blood transfusions help critical COVID patients, use blood recovered people need antibody produced natural infection. 

How one argue getting vaccine emulates COVID spike protein somehow robust body actually fighting virus. world really make sense? Aren‚Äôt vaccines actually meant help body recognize virus, take easier? Haven‚Äôt already taken own? 

If natural antibodies, going react vaccine spike protein? It‚Äôs valid asking questions. I‚Äôm anti vax, I‚Äôve taken every vaccine besides one pretty much. actual doctor advised don‚Äôt take it. Yet public seems scream take it, despite doctor saying otherwise. Someone actually told he‚Äôs wrong lmao. 

Completely unrelated, though really, Moderna profitable quarter 2021, makes think there‚Äôs reasons massive push. It‚Äôs ludicrous people know push get vaccine actual doctor said wait on. Absolutely bonkers. comment political know bot. Sigh.

But look Virginia, Utah, Maryland. severe infection fully vaccinated people also two weeks time immunity build getting infected?  Olympics coming up? I‚Äôd prepared wait That's correct absolute state that.

There single definition efficacy, multiple. one talk efficacy hospitalization. commonly used efficacy symptomatic infection. 

This much confusion comes from.

The Oxford-AZ vaccine efficacy \~60% preventing infection (Delta Variant, England Scotland data) \~90% hospitalization.

MIL even died ""she old anyway"" callous. One company's customers, large publicly traded software company, sent blast email yesterday stating anyone working one sites would required proof vaccination, including vendor employees, effective September 1.

I think we're going see policies faster realized. This. one wants mandate emergency authorization.  thing lot people stopped coming here, raises negativity percentage.  Seasonal coronaviruses peak winter months.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs evidence‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing published‚Äù different saying can‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôd point rising case numbers‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs spreading it?

Israel‚Äôs case growth nothing like UKs this. It‚Äôs incredibly important see difference current situation otherwise hopeless one last year. Vaccines job. Poland - actual fuck? Well title bollocks - 60% vaccinated Vallance simply damage control ridiculous backtracking. good news  children. Tell thousands long covid. new variants landing children hospital more. Well thats different discussion however comparison worth remembering older likely adversely affected Covid catch it. likely develop symptoms young person. vaccines reduce dont eliminate it.

In UK almost older people given AZ majority Pfizer gone 40s. Therefore people lest likely develop symptoms vaccinated given mRNA vaccine likely given Adenovirus based one.

PHE reports also estimate reduced transmission 35-50% one dose either type vaccine effect R rate broadly same.  American, bequeath people ‚Äúeven ignorant cringe US‚Äù award Let guess injected much sht covid problem check year now....feeling like 1939 again.

Also, range bars seem overlap, majority claims statistically significant, think study could improved improved sample size. What‚Äôs also sad group project need cooperate order least get passing grade. Lmao. Masking 3 year olds? That's insane clearly benefit children. US far crazy country pandemic. Neither ECDC recommend masks children 12. European country uneducated regarding vaccines. People around want learn think like that.why people afraid vaccines?

But hey keep going caps lock definitely makes sound rational Quick question: infections rise European countries. sure countries, guess better.

This we've vaccinating lot. course, vaccine outright prevent infection, prevents seriously ill.

Yet still hear rising hospital admissions. know hospital admissions mainly unvaccinated people? data that? Asking thought vaccine supposed protect hospitalization. We're 4-6 weeks behind UK comes delta variant. end June 95% UK cases Delta. US 60% cases Delta. simply much widespread delta June means less people hospitalized less people sample size looking breakthrough cases. 

Israel another country we're weeks behind terms Delta. They're beating us vaccination rates offer Pfizer J&amp;J vaccines. Take look news reports Israel see US might fair Delta spreads throughout US. They're offering third shot Pfizer immunocompromised people. Mandatory vaccinations necessary stop spread virus begin with. COVID-19 stay symptoms manageable vaccinated people.

I'm vaccinated still wear mask stores go back teach person 2 weeks will. Why? 18 month old son's pediatrician told decrease anyway potential exposure cases shit show. Someone made guesstimate, direction people hoping hear, that's good enough lot people. 

That's happened many topics pandemic. mean billions?  Hell, literally read news India last 2 months arrive conclusion. Modi (sp) really enemy people would seem. Every country idiots charge dictatorial scoffs purposefully counted dead dying Covid... good look. Seeing variants risen places Brazil India, seems unlikely vaccins preventing new variants appear.

It possible immunity due prior infection slow cases outside first world, may slow doen new variants rearing ugly hearld.

But wont know Covid-19, variant ZZ comes about. Covid-19 finally dies worldwide.

For next 12 months fully clear. Fauci lying cover Clintons baby eating lizard people!! need know reasons!  Thank comment. parent unvaccinated 9 year old type fear mongering articles scare me, even look objectively see there's really data presented article. statistics posted really help put things perspective. thought would clear comment commiseration situation. question one seems able answer *how mask top vaccine preventative vaccine own*. me, least, struggle see that's case given vaccines incredibly impressive preventing infection first place viral loads lowered impressive degree shed (because asymptomatic mildly symptomatic) seems like much additional value mask up. Love this! live Florida. CDC also post daily cases (randomly seems). four days. There‚Äôs lot things life could extra 1% protection something I‚Äôm already enormously protected against, choose to.

What life protect communicable diseases prior covid? Let guess, vaccines, good hygiene, healthy lifestyle? someone also lives area low vaccination rates, lot people wearing masks. feel you. Especially since keep reading articles indications Delta variant could putting kids risk previous variants. Cute attempt minimize impact Covid body, dice. Pre-covid walked 7 12 miles per day, regularly ran multiple flights stairs daily. took month work walking 30ft, 2 months get back walking mile day take flight stairs. felt like would imagine breathing wet gravel would feel like, occasional bouts feeling like airways closing gasping breath.

It also took 5'3"" 130lb body, knocked 20lbs 2 weeks bedridden. kept coming back span hundreds years I'm arguing that. I'm saying majority breakthrough cases asymptomatic unable spread.  think drug companies want ensure enough data told son's pediatrician, rules guidelines kids strict. son 18 months pediatrician says doesnt expect one 2022. 

With said, kids really got left behind this. parents. got shafted. absolute risk pretty unknowable changes. know it, would know things like likely close contact infected person, immune system responds vaccine, etc. things like local spread changes time. 

In general, though, 90% 95% efficacy hospitalization means vaccinated person 10 20 times less likely end hospital unvaccinated person else equal. again, else equal really huge caveat. wish data separated partially vaccinated we'd see one dose effectiveness it.  shoes, shirt, vax, service. I'm curious country like France going do.

They're apparently quite anti-vax (Not sure exactly true i've heard people getting vaccine expected that's good hear), delta variant obviously starting hit. take England approach open adults vaccinated, lock back down, stay state stuff locked stuff isn't. I'm thinking specifically legal precedence indoor smoking. Specifically, customer really legal way say business needs ban smoking, employees places legal foothold smoking ban.

That said, really wish people food prep forced wear masks job. generally get paid sick leave anyway, would good way stop spread lot airborne diseases.  Wow that's mindbogglingly wrong.  title makes sound people shot danger. bad. Real world data leaving doubt vaccinated people get ill infect people, particularly Delta variant.

However much fewer cases, get less ill, consequently attribute less new cases think things ‚Äònormal-ish‚Äô. like 2018 normal certainly way things middle virus peaks. Delta variant cautious people starting react little, think majority people going regular life largest extent.  Florida reports cases weekly Friday. This. OP recognize ptsd trauma associated moms decision, also recognize immense privilege able afford retire age.

I‚Äôm 31 it‚Äôs pipe dream (and generation) able retire 60.
She‚Äôs celebrating education work put dream job, she‚Äôs proud got finish terms. know US end everything? whatever US consolation? bigger Germany parts better others much worse. Makes wonder many people ACTUALLY vaccinated.  passed ridiculous laws restricting women rights.  excellent! information needed make informed decisions concerning personal risk risk tolerance. dont think thats correct.

In country Netherlands six weeks doses, afaik.  'could be', ARE.

Let's dance around it. Goodness messed up! 99% survival rate. look recorded cases compared deaths, worldwide locally, maths lmao im making crazy. discussions regarding vaccinated people wearing masks doesn‚Äôt matter. 

If vaccine 100% efficient, matter. not, lower spread wearing mask vaccinated. Whether that's necessary discussion, I'd personally lean towards no, pretending mask offer protection vaccinated wrong. definitely people go overboard, direction better. I'm Newfoundland Labrador. numbers weird right one 3 ships covid cases sent here. 49 cases 3 ships 3 people hospital. 1 active cases related ships new cases since beginning July. absolutely done. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I tell definitively Canadian US noticeably right everything compared rest west, extends media. don‚Äôt need look way CNN treated Bernie Sanders campaigns. dude bog standard social democrat (a term never seen used US media), he‚Äôs made second coming Karl Marx. 

Anyways, isn‚Äôt forum that, I‚Äôll stop there. Sorry mods. See say that, part reason data likely coming timely way almost definitely Israel deal Pfizer regarding vaccine data doses. would stand reason Israel thought vaccine working well data show it, come forward fully data tied deal Pfizer. 

The UK Canada reason lie, hide data make things obtuse. knew something they'd say it. Israel may know something lack ability come forward fully. Correct, likely discussions several years come. Mostly instead mandating vaccine, something guaranteed work, instead engage debates like little make antivaxxers laugh us more. scary. question may settled bunch fully vaccinated people long Covid 12 months now. know many long Covid patients initially mild cases Covid. Today: 2/3 UK adults vaccinated.

Also Today: highest daily covid death count.

Edit: I‚Äôm trying make sense story Serious question: could virus mutate point MRNA vaccines become ineffective?  several local lock downs China past year. It‚Äôs usually limited city part province. Daegu - Korea last year, cultist group deliberately spread virus. different time, Delta variant.

Also, economy suffering hard gov afraid go time, thus made everything worse. lot people want stamp feet complain fair, lot options slowing spread.

The rate fully vaccinated Delta cases admitted inpatients ~15% (173 1,165), unvaccinated ‚ÄúHighest daily total since March‚Äù. I‚Äôm trying understand highest daily death total happened today 2/3 folks vaccinated. Weird number seem similar 0 vaccinations I‚Äôm sure mask mandates 

The people don‚Äôt get vaccinated also socializing traveling dumb stuff

It seem worth Meanwhile Florida weekly numbers, anyone without permanent residency excluded hospitalizations reported, they‚Äôve deleted database. fucking state. I'm big bank. month ago confirmed returns August September, people (especially unvaccinated kids) really spoke division-wide meeting, execs budging. big thing employers want liable breakouts - JPM cases last year amongst traders looked bad. bank, hand, explicitly said want lead ""return office trend,"" fully office soon safe.

No updates yet things postponed. I'm New York office though, I'm closely tied tech world. clients office... we? 

My big worry public transport packed like sardines. Even though I'm vaccinated, likely fine, pass someone unvaccinated child compromised immune system? someone complications? *I'm* one gets sick?

My favorite argument.

50 people USA die lightning strikes every year.

These people banning weather and/or never leaving homes logic. read ridiculous headline again.

Why Asia's 'Zero Covid' strategy could zero-tolerance approach helped control Covid-19, time exit long Australia's zero-COVID strategy strategy!

Why journalists new organisation want paint countries succeeded clamping virus lacking something?

Is ashamed horrible toll allowed take countries?

It's logical human strategy country take. Short lockdown quarantines borders everyone vaccinated. quarantines lifted.

Minimal economic damage, minimal death toll, minimal mutations. Everybody wins. (except covid19)

And real news India actually suffered 4 million dead instead 400 thousand nowhere seen.  Yeah it‚Äôs odd Israel keeps putting things there, over, failing provide actual data, substance, little context. can‚Äôt help feel like there‚Äôs something going on, especially say stands stark contrast info UK, Scotland, Canada, Italy, Singapore, more. really choice spread keeps increasing. need mandatory vaccinations, that's tricky. 

Hopefully get vaccine requirements gets approval. I‚Äôm sure think traveling abroad need sort proof, whether it‚Äôs negative Covid test 10-15% hardcore antivax, loud fuck. people get vaxxed eventually. Thing didnt leave enough time everybody get shots quite lot thought may compromise summer vacations, government lifting restrictions. 4 weeks later, surprise, there's delta variant, hurry get vaxxed. totally agree. would add CDC mostly made staff former administration, put place Koch brothers, overtly stated want see drastic reduction population.  first day SEC Media Days Monday, commissioner Greg Sankey made clear teams need get players vaccinated. don't, could cost win. 

""They've [vaccines] proven highly effective people fully vaccinated ability to...maximize chances returning normal college football experience, normal life."" 90% doses Canada Pfizer Moderna. UK efficacy Pfizer found higher AZ, like original trials.

Israeli data seriously puzzling. USA doesn‚Äôt monopoly stupidity. Truly research humanity needs darkest hour. Yet proof Fox immoral propaganda outlet run hypocrites trying make buck matter cost.   Pfizer performs worse AZ delta isn‚Äôt Israel‚Äôs cases growing similar rate UK. Theoretically cases even worse UK then. think bad actors fall line. enough regular people taking extra precautions help reduce community spread. 

Covid feel like it. Antisemitism rise accounts majority hate crimes  *sighs ‚ÄòMurican* Every country!!! Unfortunately, really see solution though. going do, try encourage people continue wear masks social distance eternity? always going possibility mutation. Consider fact people likely actually follow mask/social distance orders ones actually vaccinated, see that's really solving anything. 

The solution mandated vaccines. Hopefully FDA approve thing soon workforces feel compelled mandate vaccinations. don‚Äôt card since you‚Äôve fully vaccinated 4 months? absolutely work well. 

Which still need people masked places less 70% vaccination rates. 

Local mask mandates re-instituted people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. 

It‚Äôs well vaccines work. It‚Äôs stupid stubborn humans are. repackaging material data.gouv.fr, *actual* source. Awfully misleading headline, trash article. Yes does, many ob/gyns offices go great lengths inform pregnant women risks.

How seen great co sleeping debate? mean, dude. could make much better argument never dropping mandates anywhere first place, even maybe. really think bad actors causing going suddenly fall line told SECOND time, happening.

The people listen people causing infinitesimal amount problem first place. *Hospitalized children count grows 2 4*

The media: ""KID HOSPITALIZATIONS INCREASE 100%!""

The article provides raw number cases children hospitalizations/deaths know they're trying mislead headline. first day SEC Media Days Monday, commissioner Greg Sankey made clear teams need get players vaccinated. don't, could cost win. 

As stands, six 14 football teams SEC reached 80% vaccinated threshold better. Teams 85% vaccinated required test regularly wear masks inside school facilities. 
""That number needs grow needs grow rapidly,"" Sankey said.
""They've [vaccines] proven highly effective people fully vaccinated ability to...maximize chances returning normal college football experience, normal life."" 

‚Äî‚Äî-

This good news push teams players may hesitant getting vaccine finally get one. Hopefully extends students well. last call make unavailable refused along. anyone wants one window closed, would pay absurd amount pocket.

Let chips fall may. Mask mandates travel restrictions can't last forever. long unvaccinated people area international travel, coming back.  Procedural.

Even efficacy known short would still make sense require right now.  Keep mind UK isn‚Äôt lot Pfizer 

What happening Israel predictive USA UK since majority vaccinations Pfizer similar Moderna (not sure Moderna also struggle Delta it‚Äôs possible) Exactly. summer surge likely, actually happened quite bit later many states' mask mandates ending. Sick listening emotional comments like one replying to. surge going occur, masks not. Otherwise explain Texas' low case numbers mid-March onwards?  ""Scalise, No. 2 Republican House"" 
 
""Scalise said politics vaccination factor decision inoculated""

Yeah right... record deaths today spike infection?  read upload via app website, vaccine card get getting shots. example I‚Äôm heading Puerto Rico today (I‚Äôm US citizen) tourism website said got shots make sure upload document bring actual card   I‚Äôm time release new efficacy rate without supporting data get skeptical. certain point it‚Äôs time back claims even data ‚Äúpreliminary‚Äù

Also drop significant aren‚Äôt seeing explosion cases UK seeing? Yes cases going slope much gradual. what‚Äôs explanation vaccine nearly effective think 60% population vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt add up.      headline indicates opposite. vaccine effective variants. Hospitalization reduced presently least 80% deaths 95%. many people taking precautions able keep getting disease Delta's higher transmissibility got past defenses. Well cheat statistics cannot cheat death    probably don‚Äôt really like hypothetical person begin with. different moral values, likely political beliefs. good know! link details? work university South, SEC school, though. cannot require students vaccinate Corona, cannot require wear masks, can't require socially distance... can't even require mask they're private offices. faculty option virtual office hours, us staff sort hope best.

It's students care about.  Open mobile browser ""desktop mode"" mention King County (Seattle, Eastside, Shoreline) 80% one dose 12+ 74.1% fully vaccinated 12+.

I see significant spike much like fall happen high rates like that.

I'm dreading possibility another shutdown lockdown later year. Last year, November 2020 February 2021, hell worst I've felt mentally. cannot fathom go another hell time period like that, really hope happen vaccines prevent significant jump. That‚Äôs super bizarre. Cant imagine it‚Äôs super accurate given huge difference state state. one day

Back Unvaccinated people give shit mandate, means zilch stop spread serve piss vaccinated people begrudgingly wear masks protect unvaxxed Darwined. no, would dumb. pessimistic sarcastic, meant serious lol Consult doctor get tested.  Genuinely, understand vaccines work? build natural immune system body prepared fight virus infection develops deadly disease. massive headstart recovery, blanket immunity. month quotes?  doubt manufacturers going make tweaks make vaccine effective mutations, make cause fewer side effects. here, really hoping studies come specific conditions/meds efficacy Breakthrough cases happen. infected person typically either symptoms cold like symptoms. Extremely rare vaccinated person hospitalized/die. like hurricanes... they'll start different alphabet lol. So, rule removing mask indoors all, want mandates businesses, business inherently involves activities precluded mask, like, say, eating, business aid also gone, restaurant owner do? understand, virus would change almost completely stop vaccines working all. won‚Äôt ever happen lifetimes, always benefit vaccinated. Please someone correct I‚Äôm wrong. 54% population fully vaccinated. call vast majority.  Vaccinated people lot safer forced interact unvaccinated people order earn living. Normally, would right‚Ä¶. buy express pass. Lock down. Go Scotland! bosses realize stock market risk again. think matters mRNA point view maybe grouped together. Good you!

Nobody make sense gets side effects doesn't.   I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad idea, I‚Äôm saying that, someone working hospital, people getting Covid close friends, family, co-workers. People aren‚Äôt going mask around friends family spread occurring. Imposing mask mandates might mitigate much one would think. prioritise vaccinated include cases end hospitalization death? IHME University Washington updated COVID forecast showing massive, massive spike cases WA Fall. It‚Äôs larger rise spike last Fall, basically exponential starting now. Oregon, CA NY, etc.

Anyone idea that‚Äôs about? WA 70% vaccinated adults 16+. Given IHME based state WA, one would imagine closely-watched COVID forecast would carefully crafted home kids 12 likely can't get vaccinated till midwinter. get choice. many letters left? /s That's Alpha, longer relevant. COVID delta, delta numbers basically need look new data since early July. seen US numbers recent though.

Good luck comrade, still bumpy road ahead! beautiful moment mid December mid May rest developed world briefly envied US' handling pandemic, returning stable equilibrium shaking heads.

Hoping best. best rundown comes directly CDC: clinical trials involved tens thousands people, millions people taken since then, intensive monitoring. Side effects vaccine historically seen within six weeks vaccination, many months since first people vaccinated. something bad, we'd know now.

That's we've got. prove them, nothing ever will. believe terrible effects waiting year show up, can't wait another year, another that? believe bad things happening, cleverly hidden us worldwide conspiracy, evidence matters, conspiracy arranged all.

This I've skeptical COVID-Zero. got whole world buy in, may work. that's gunna happen Vaccines sitting shelves people avoid clearly relevant variants spreading, since refusing vaccination worsens issue. Neither would I. feel terrible kids school subjected zoom class wearing masks. understand necessary first feels like theatre. Suppose someone tell opinion Sun revolves around Earth. keep open mind listen them?

There concept subject matter expertise, types understand respect. think ""opinions"" vaccination, race, economics, history, astronomy etc carry weight actual experts say ""you wrong"" respond ""I'm keeping opinion anyway"". following mostly‚Ä¶ Duh. done. rather overall past 7/30/90 days vaccination hit critical mass past months. hope states this(at least states believe vaccination). wait *for FDA approval allow vaccine mandated*. thought agreed? Seems like Australia widespread civil disobedience measures, completely understandable. Congrats! Feel better soon - take easy now.

Nobody said otherwise. arguing yourself. 5.5% new cases within period detected among people fully vaccinated

That's right.   hell anything people suffering dying Covid.

Your comment absolutely disgusting hateful. works enough people together. Look companies dominate bully employees. many employees cave hard ball employer BS job needing done office usually not. also lot easier stable financial position. going office. know lot already back hadnt even vaccine. makes convinced employer care die covid not. matter probability dying covid fact care die transmissable disease.  think that's correct 

It mean antibodies helping though. current variants much easily spread original one though. 

Without prior levels immunity, spikes would much much much steeper original waves. Instead though, waves pretty comparable previous ones. 

Places like Brazil maybe India achieved herd immunity earlier variants. bar gets raised new variants. 

It looks like vaccinated countries might even achieved herd immunity alpha. that's enough prevent Delta. 

As example - R 3, go 1 100 cases time R 8 would go 1 6200 cases. work construction prior lock instructed employer mandatory test every 3 days..

But reliable figures actual residents ? residents + non residential workers ? Thank you, Scotland! frustrates much.

I'm glad agree wait FDA approves vaccine mandated :) sounds like complete utter bullshit tbh. Hoosiers!! ""Let's win game small schools never chance get here.""

Hopefully small schools, schools country, follow suit! I'd say huge fan understatement. FIFA WC going November 2022, summer anyone know verifying vaccine status . . . honor system?

Considering pressure open border almost entirely US side Canadian tourists could return Northeast, Americans allowed across border freely. strange played out.  ...it 48 hours proven correct. I'm gonna go buy weed. I'm baseball fan entire teams got vaccine played baseball next day earlier year.

What silly excuse, especially since months it. valid points. Guess talking people intentionally don‚Äôt get vaccinated. struggle sympathy them. It‚Äôs self inflicted wound point. 
Even niece &amp; nephew refuse get it. don‚Äôt even want talk anymore. can't make up? understand expression something feel would pretty easy make up. True, much see pans out! individual what's right. shouldn‚Äôt theory, might practice. think nurse association America actually issued condemnation CDC it.

Saying insane track cases among vaccinated people.

Just looked yep, condemned fair amount actions CDC back may, almost like saw 11?  Honestly, I‚Äôve avoided lot interiors last couple days deal yet. went weekend went grocery shopping stocked Costco, get masks came back. work home know one gym class doesn‚Äôt care masks I‚Äôve gone last couple days.

I‚Äôll find week‚Ä¶ might take desert gtfo little while. WTAF??? screwed scientists...deny science.  vast majority breakthrough cases symptomatic enough cause someone feel sick get tested. 3474 people relatively serious cases, naturally going elderly immunocompromised group, people outcomes tend bad regardless vaccination. sadly correct. try avoid allowing thoughts path, completely on-point. 

Vaccination really choice - (or least should-be regarded-as) one's responsibility order part society he/she born.

Edit: need elaborate - try let thoughts travel path I'm server beer wings establishment south (southern USA) takes considerable amount energy able agree people clock. choice - wage $2.13/hr customer pays bills.  parents idiots, proof C's get degrees There‚Äôs virus causes 200000 cases cancer every year. one?

Good question. data released murky. (Infections lumped large age group instead sectioned were.) Hospitalization data hard come by. end result know unless hospital releases info media. incredibly frustrating thing. literally decades research mRNA technology. Synthetic mRNA first created 1960s. companies created current mRNA vaccines working tech 10 years. 

And even ignore side affects would apparent within two months dosage. vaccines long term hidden effects pop later that. People (rightfully) wanted convince others go get vaccinated. part that, lot people using selling point ""if get vaccinated, back normal.""

So people understandably upset turns quite case. 

The problem many people unable unwilling understand nuance, like vaccines wonderful helpful, situations arise temporarily need additional measures. well, i'm nonstop diarrhea guess i'm good. Sorry, I¬¥m tired make sense...

On impf website linked, show region highest number fully vaccinated people rate 51% (represented dark blue). I'm going guess total pop (100% people DE) rather total eligible (84% people DE).

This speculation part, based decrease demand mention design perspective, seems like dark blue ""highest"" color (unless change scale add extra tier different color), would say perhaps gov counting total vaccination rate end low, around 50-65% (100% - 16% - 20?%). definitely lower I'm conformable with. speculation part.

I know government made declarations expect numbers actions take make sure reach highest numbers, rather blindly focusing supply. I'm gunna need Olympics watch party. group passionate armchair quarterback every event though none us followed anything Olympics 4 previous years First study cited says 8 per 100,000 kids, 64% underlying health condition, plus  15% obese (not sure overlap )

For countries, well coordinated lockdowns strict border policies still best bet ending virus. 

Following China, New Zealand Australia example may better option many others. 

The problem is, world hill two sides. high cases high vaccination. cases low vaccinations. 

And travel two would incredibly inconvenient. 

I really think part global strategy focus lowering case numbers, lowering deaths. hope British people start travelling low risk countries. put back mandates? say let everything open mask nothing. unvaccinated want way. like warned. want risk death beliefs. judge. Let natural selection run course. Maybe region dont end ER doesnt make okay. Huh. That's actually subreddit.

I think patients treated COVID units. Id assume obesity think anti vaxx stupid. Bill gates nothing  Nobody really sure make Israel case data. hospital data still shows 90+% protection. math wrong. 

Possibilities:
1) high proportion unvaccinated previously infected. 
2) unvaccinated insular community interacting much outside community. 
3) vaccine begins wear significantly starting 6 months (but anywhere except Israel) 
4) three week dosing schedule provide durable antibodies. 

1 2 data issue. 3 4 vaccine issue.

Another possibility vaccine great protecting people small amounts exposure (i.e. masks distancing). opening virus easily able break through, still cause cold. Florida better lot states took precautions you‚Äôre clamoring for, nevertheless.  Makes curious fraction Louisiana nursing home residents vaccinated. smh. Social pressure, gentle, relentless.

Closing schools? Canceling Halloween? sure worth it.  thank antivaxxers way verify vaccination that. Agree this. people aren‚Äôt douchebags there. wear mask asked courtesy anyhow. friend told there. Plus really monitor anyone entering country strict quarantine upon arrival. help understand mild death? vaccinated, higher chance dying car accident getting Covid dying it. vaccine extremely effective.

So world care someone else's vaccination status? bearing health. 

Most people sub masking vaccination even realize mask protect catching virus, limits transmission, even evidence limited degree much might limit transmission. Masks hardly limited transmission anywhere US comparing data mask mandates versus after. deductive reasoning skills.

Take advice. People seem forgotten that, several weeks ago, scientists UK experiment proving clubs perfectly safe long patrons fully vaccinated/negative. England also seemed forgotten this, seeing they've made almost effort prioritize vaccinations among youth. 

I hope goes better expected, not, achieves making people think clubs concerts problem people unvaccinated. vaccinated done job. mind blown thinking many commenters Reddit talked Long Covid sufferer find made heads?!?! young still helps, given reason needed transplant. majority young transplant patients likely dealt extreme pulmonary issues lives. That‚Äôs huge burden body organs make massive difference. There‚Äôs also future infections- rejection meds halt immune system recipients, older double lung transplant patients three times likely die infections, viruses, etc. younger 45.

I‚Äôd also add, there‚Äôs someone‚Äôs numerical age, there‚Äôs biological age. Someone maybe 21 years old, biological age akin someone closer 50. Someone who‚Äôs suffered severe COPD, constant infections, etc. majority youth likely much higher biological age peers.

It‚Äôs really going come much damage covid done rest body. He‚Äôs still going severely reduced lifespan, assuming he‚Äôs otherwise moderate health recovery, he‚Äôs much better position vast majority double lung transplant patients.

It‚Äôs also going depend seriously takes health going forward. personally, think pressing issue.

Bergamo Brescia excess mortality: Bergamo province 0.5-6% population die ~3 weeks March 2020, areas nearly untouched others 1-2% range.

These places also quite urban. Generally 80% population urban/suburban, spread rural areas basically inconsequential comparison. certainly possible rural areas would much lower attack rates. Urban areas get problems spread *so* fast occasion delay infection hospitalization (2-3 weeks) means hospitals overwhelmed people panic, already 2-3 weeks late many care.

In above, age distribution infected important factor end result. everyone 40 vaccinated (as UK now) mitigation essentially complete hospital capacity danger.

Literally one thing like watch gymnastics. It‚Äôs fucking cool. girls work hard. ok, also wore one work anytime house got vaccinated. complain wear one.

Our even semi-vaccinated population fare better past. 
Still need 2+2 weeks see numbers pan though. lot hospital workers getting vaccinated so... Risk COVID death certainly low fully vaccinated point. knows next winter brings, far they're effective. I‚Äôm guessing haven‚Äôt taken look prices weights last year Well mention previously covid according South African study mean whole lot new variants. know demographics UK quick google see 36m people 2 doses. 2/3rds eligible population vaccinated means 18m unvaccinated people.

I saw currently 4100 hospitalized patients COVID. 40% 2 dose vaccinated that's 1640 people (2460 vaccinated).

How many COVID positive cases among vaccinated people? could find half current cases among people least 1 dose. approx 1m active COVID cases UK, say half vaccinated, that's 500k.

1640/500000 actually way 99% effective, considering 500k vaccinated people 36m even got COVID first place, that's pretty damn good actually. can‚Äôt things, they‚Äôre probably US. know things US, don‚Äôt need remind us. makes nervous large festivals happening upcoming weeks SoCal.... requirement vaccinations seems like gonna shit show Thanks!

(and no, close, I'm Spain, speak Spanish catalan hahaha (even I'm Osaka now) ) Long haul children pretty rare tbh. People definitely talking delta more. fully vaxed Republican mom even asked start wearing mask again.  Considering we‚Äôre 48% fully immunization country don‚Äôt follow bullshit point?  Certainly old people.  younger unvaxxed sections population. 

I asked question elsewhere US's experience different. Many (possibly most) states reporting unvaccinated people hospitalized. I'm glad puzzles me. Like wtf, want live dystopian world can't even see friends family?

Believe not, lot Redditors want ache days return. Sad. Right, asked US it‚Äôs dangerous kids.   mean like 69% increase week week overall US hospitalizations? mean honestly we‚Äôre year in. Cases followed hospitalizations weeks later followed deaths weeks later. Good luck... :)

(Are francophone?)  want people go along vaccine passports maybe perpetuate idea vaccine proof leads result overall. types articles hurt vaccine effort. US exceptional completely reopened back normal. It‚Äôs still 2020 many countries. I'm trying understand (understandably, think) concerning read. 40% hospitalizations fully vaccinated people really, really scary me. concern me, Dad (fully vaccinated Pfizer), 70 Diabetes Parkinson's. safe still given news? missing something would make lot less scary sounds (that's I'm really hoping hear someone, least)? Interesting. actual buildings, like tarps tents something?  mom palliative care nurse. turned 60 week ago retired birthday. pandemic completely broke her. beyond fortunate never caught covid even working hospital since began. line work many patients help die comfortably. couldn‚Äôt anymore.

She plans gardening, baking, getting back hobbies quit nurse. She‚Äôs noticeably suffering ptsd private. encourage find therapist hope gets help.

I friends going nursing right now. know far established nurses straight quit.. don‚Äôt think nation, prepared shortages await medical field. people US allowed work hospital setting without vaccine ???  Proof vaccines aren‚Äôt terribly effective :) Going back lockdowns admission getting vaccinated pointless ineffective. county SNFs also recovered nurses CNAs lost death, ill health, burnout, quitting, etc Threats leave lot empty bluster, especially mandate industry wide. Im interested seeing studies years try uncover asyptomatic symptomatic ratio. number hard know asymptotics probably never checked in.

And would say hesitants stupid, seem really skills taking clearly seems better side bad bet currently take. persist here: forgoing vaccine worst side bet. side keeps economy closure going, makes last year become new normal.

Yeah, vaccine 10 years runway like would love, like tech based upon created yesterday either. good decade testing research things.

The risks could there. think maybe face certitude, low maybe that. people vaccine hesitant stupid. many stupid articles regurgitating thing going written? It‚Äôs technically untrue, I‚Äôd worried billions around world access vaccines comes mutations. Yes, however apparently rained couple hours time many participants took shelter together poorly ventilated areas, likely transmission took place. Yes. People can't seem get heads fact 90% efficacy severe cases, means 10 unvaccinated people would gotten severe case, instead 1 vaccinated person would have. 

That's great efficacy, still means COVID running totally rampant, lot vaccinated people.will.still get severe cases. simply sustainable reasonable continue years-long shutdown normal life indefinitely theoretical possibility bad mutation could occur. That‚Äôs good enough reason preoccupied cases. remember still need negative PCR test enter Canada must quarantine plan travelers coming Canada, regardless vaccine status, need negative PCR molecular test within 72 hours requesting must still provide quarantine plan prepared quarantine, case determined border meet necessary requirements. There‚Äôs way would legal, though. Yeah, man. 2020 stressful year life. Let's say COVID might stolen time. mentals nowhere near strong 2018. want talk 2019. accurate statement hard swallow. Evidence moves slowly. 

It logical think vaccinated folks spreading fewer germs fight infection reliably evidence yet prove serve petri dishes build deadly virus. unlikely conclusive evidence. 

I came say something along line of: ""don't all"". support statement mainly think better ignore anti-vaxx crowd try fight words logic. particularly large crowd amplify message.  ...I literally gave example ratio deaths cases never pre vaccines Yup sounds like wasn‚Äôt going try get vaccine give timeline barely opportunity get one got sick  JOKE

USA fitness centers per capita anywhere developed world. USA spends per capita educating kids same.

Poor choices Good China?

Or bad US stalled early lead?
Are remaining unvaccinated hesitant antivax? states Montana ‚Äúat will‚Äù employment laws. anti-masker types I've interacted even acknowledge long-haul covid. We've seen headlines confirming months months ago. nothing new. Regardless, basis wearing masks remains ""there's nothing afraid 1% death rate.""

You bring permanently damage you, they'll come assuming damage occurs people hospitalized. low percentage people get hospitalized. nothing worry about.

When clarify damage even never feel flu symptoms, might jump onto different argument. Like masks keep newborns seeing mother's face immediately birth, hurts babies.

The anti-mask platform ""aren't giving Covid fear."" think facts science would objective enough, good enough anti-maskers start. never be. heard someone point despite touting afraid Covid, anti-maskers really seem come people *terrified* wearing mask. One would even say truly believe wearing mask carries higher death rate wearing one.

Having another good argument belt going address existential threat anti-maskers feeling told wear mask. Trying get Covid less important first trying get irrational fear masks.

Edit: I'm lumping anti-maskers anti-vaxxers there's large overlap. believe finding correct approach one will, turn, find correct approach other. never even question. Anyone genuinely thought last year would ever rid covid fooling themselves. Influenza still killing tens thousands year, would covid different even higher r0? immunocompromised? Best wishes success. miss cousin, learn wear Kevlar needed. lend open arm occasion moment kindness others. risks vaccine small nearly impossible measure.

You people getting sick COVID everyday.

You thr math. Yea think it‚Äôs faulty tests. things accurate whatsoever. Covid going around forever, need get life god, he'd killed queen giving covid things would gotten really... Interesting. üò¨ Hospital data usually near real time. least state. hospitals report numbers daily worst it‚Äôs one day behind. 
 
Or talking time contracting disease symptoms bad enough admitted?  Yes. Make sure contagious though. works 100%. Latest data Israel shows vaccine 60% effective delta variant, vaccinated people spreading it. I'm (personally) at. concerns regarding Covid 17 month old,, things I'm worried about, thats I'm focusing energy. constant state panic sustainable long-term. 

I'm lucky live area decent vax rates. important adults daughter's life vaccinated. daycare shared they'll keeping nearly safety procedures next year (but returning extended hours, thank goodness!). know lot people fortunate enough similar situation. Obviously may reevaluate risk tolerance things change, right works family. 

That said, I'm really dreading teaching wear mask. Canada require negative PCR test arrivals regardless vaccination travelers coming Canada, regardless vaccine status, need negative PCR molecular test within 72 hours requesting entry. truly scary since seems like much greater demand far future. mind talking it, illnesses brother-in-law have? Government needs grow balls recommend reimplement (if power to) national mask mandates. 

If covid classic even Alpha variant thing vaccines alone probably could end pandemic. Unfortunately Delta mother transmissible variants vaccines alone aren‚Äôt enough prevent infection. Masks absolutely needed.  90%+ older population comorbidities vaccinated.

So fact younger healthier people 60% hospitalizations (instead maybe 10% vaccine scenario) means vaccines working well. No, need upload negative PCR test results that's within 72hrs entry though  I‚Äôm that. That‚Äôs scares anything long term disability able enjoy life like want to. 8.3M eligible people LA County, 5.1M fully vaccinated. Probably pre existing condition

Oh, may well be, though still think underestimate much contact goes much virus spread masks (and gloves make much difference one way other). lot people delivery drivers, supermarket workers medical workers work keep society running even lockdown, think that's one reason lockdowns successful hoped world.

As said, might denial, find people over-optimistic much policy stop virus, China's apparent success gave world false idea almost deaths avoidable. 1918-style ""we can't stop it, let's go lives"" approach would better country like U.S., hard border closures ""real"" lockdowns never politically possible.

I mean literally top head. don‚Äôt understand things happen lose massive legitimacy trust levels public institutions, rightly honest. Well funny, that's problem. Maybe ones higher vaccination rate ones easing restrictions?

And 40%, look demographic hospital, let's say 95% people 60+ (this might totally accurate work argument) double vaccination rate age group, probably around 90-95% too, see infact success. take 1000 people 100 hospital corona, 1000 people 900 vaccinated 40 100 60 100 arent see vaccine clearly effective.  There's also countries around world population unvaccinated due supply... country perfectly shut borders. really hope covid vaccines get full approval (versus emergency approval), hospitals nursing homes make mandatory. Israel data-sgaring agreement Pfizer (which condition agreement get vaccines early). countries that. one reasons Israeli data comprehensive. expect it‚Äôs something like (note: real numbers):

High-risk Population X, 1000 infected individuals, would normally hospitalized 200/1000 cases. vaccines prevent 90% hospitalizations, bringing total hospitalizations 20.

 Lower-risk Population Y, vaccinated, hospitalized 20/1000 cases. vaccination, would hospitalizations. However, since vaccinated, 20 end admitted.

When numbers released hospital, 50% 40 hospitalizations fully vaccinated people. statistic sounds scary without context. context would 220 hospitalizations without vaccination. 

Israel UK‚Äôs numbers seem supporting - they‚Äôve large number cases without corresponding rise hospitalizations deaths. 11 day non-stop migraine Moderna. I‚Äôve heard others get migraines similar.  It‚Äôs realm possibility athlete migraines- Serena Williams outspoken hers.

Not that, athletes could easily pre-existing conditions make severe symptoms likely. Eler Danlos Syndrome autoimmune disease causes hyper mobility, wouldn‚Äôt surprised least one gymnast swimmer has. autoimmune disorders don‚Äôt effect athleticism could ‚Äúset off‚Äù immune response vaccine. Another thing helped took many years approved trusted organization rushed without proper testing r different groups blame, mostly people travel taking variants across globe (vacinated unvaccinated). sure obsession people vaccinated anti maskers, arent moving variants across globe.  Yeah, they‚Äôre people perpetually want victim. victimization literally head.

I‚Äôm regulating news. fact kind deep misinformation permitted ridiculous ruining lives killing people. fact matter people fight tooth nail ‚Äúright‚Äù misinformed. They‚Äôre going allow actual regulation. 

Had done something 20 years ago, sure, misinformation era strong regulate right now. It‚Äôs going happen nearly half voting population actively wants this. akhamjoe14, would 3 vaccinated people, total 5 8 unvaccinated = Imagine group 1000 people, 950 vaccinated 50 unvaccinated. Imagine 5 50 got hospitalised. would mean 10% chance hospitalisations unvaccinated. imagine 3 950 got hospitalised. would mean approximately 0.3% chance getting hospitalised vaccinated. total number people hospitalised 8, 3 8 vaccinated. 5 8 unvaccinated (62.5%). Thus almost 40% people hospitalised vaccinated, yet change fact chance vaccinated person hospitalised 30 times less unvaccinated person. Hopefully information supporting finding! Fingers crossed. read survey can't help question validity. people? ""pro-lockdown"" person know, million years would support know anyone would. estimating 25%-33% people get covid form long covid, including asymptomatic actual infection. sounds like majority time thise symptoms dont go away first month two still ongoing, many people finding relief get vaccinated. 34 million us cases even 10% long haul still symptoms year later would talking million people far US. UK apparently going release new data long term Covid vaccines next week two. Texas checking in. Governor already said jail anyone trying mandate flew head. Stay strong Tennessee. Lead us back 14th Century. Yup criss cross coming. Others saying us shortly.   seen Sir Patrick Vallance's statistic gave press conference today, 19 July. 60% hospitalisations covid double vaccinated people, rather 60% hospitalisations covid currently unvaccinated people.

Antivaxxers like youself despair central belief (that vaccines work) proved wrong...  Thanks. 15% population providing 60% hospitalizations. Good luck explaining people.  I'm sure messaging required get currently unvaccinated take it. I'm getting point think virus become scarier vaccine them. say someone deep unvaccinated South. people insane. right 40 percent kind vaccination exactly low. athletes depend lungs dumb act like taking extra precautions.

Naturally vaccine *process* whole evade immune system all, since entire point activate it. sneak around bit first. vaccine mRNA altered viral sequence least 3 substantive ways: 

1. substitution synthetic methylpseudouracil uracil (evades immediate destruction immune defenses)
2. substitution nucleosides within equivalent codons (encodes amino acid produces larger amounts protein) 
3. substitution non-equivalent proline codons key points sequence (prevents isolated spike protein rearranging structurally compared way folded attached surface intact virus) Yep. healthcare workers scientists.

Fun fact: bears actually wipe Charmin. Therapy literally based science. need, assuming troll. That‚Äôs problem need avoid, variations mutating &amp; possibly becoming deadly. holding breath Yeah, saw myself. Delta produced 1000x increase viral load IIRC? Aint truth read comments carefully and/or reply carefully.

""None"" really leave much room interpretation, told vaccines reduce likelihood death.

Good job, ya played yourself.

And, yes, young healthy also greatly reduces one's chances death.

i found live battling depression 5 years dont wanna lose fucking body hard long covid never happy again.

and studies show even double vaccination doesnt prevent long covid.

thats dont want it. circumstances try stay safe possible. Usually viruses get less deadly mutate. opinion deadly one could emerge. virus keep mutating updated vaccines given later anyways. Kind waste lungs then. May well give smoker. still big long hospital stay (esp. respiratory disease drop weight pretty quickly) almost certainly obese before, technically video. 

""no diabetes, hypertension"" polite way skirt around implications simply fat risk disease, since something like half america is.  Fuck haters, comply. never safer fully vaxxed. Covid never going away. fully vaxxed, risk serious Illness hospitalization basically nil. Large freq well written posts means job., major part job. side act career....his career medical media. 

Doesnt make bad...just caution  like first instinct assume voted trump. Nope, republican, don‚Äôt watch fox news certainly don‚Äôt like buffon trump fucking politician matter. Never did. knew going response though. red blue right? Congrats programmed false dichotomy rep vs dem. Probably hard pill swallow lot people population's perception (including Reddit's) long COVID joke. definitely exists, lung organ tissue damage, particularly who've hospitalised. vast majority cases long COVID symptoms physiologically measurable they're emotional symptoms - anxiety, trauma, fatigue (can physiological too), insomnia, depression etc. They're doubt challenge health authorities unlikely multi-faceted multiple causes. would speculate children suffering long COVID reason tend less worries adults every year. republican hatechristians something?  Yeah numbers low-ish, approaching seasonal flu, ... need classes, friends! frustrating clarity serious infection risks. School's coming fast. I'm inclined think there's *some* really long COVID stuff. kids? bad? are. majority cases unvaccinated. vaccinated? Congrats gonna ok  horseshoe theory Ah hell nah. antivaccers got vaccine misinformed point view, society wants endanger themselves. Perhaps society learn better let people accept misinformation truth. Hey, anti-vax still people disposable income.

Anti-vax share, get page views reading headline go home happy made-up world still making sense.

Vaccinated, educated people also get page views stick around read whole article, also go happy understanding numbers percentages.

It's win win serve ads everyone. asking something science based. something helpful. something dont know of. maybe knowledge wrong, maybe tests gotten better, maybe smart strategies havent thought dont know anything helpful.

and ""just dont worry 4head"" Covid doesn‚Äôt care politics. ravaged liberal areas too, hard. record I‚Äôm liberal short patience doomsayers sub Build wall around antivax states, make pay it. /s Yes, except know risk also vaccinated UK. need lot analysis back efficacy number. humanity favor remove worthless contributions intelligent conversation. I'm sure liar moron, bullshit greater pox humanity covid, that's saying something. current graphic show cases per capita since beginning last 7 days. Select ""Cases"" ""Current 7 day average"" get picture state new cases.

Only per capita data gives meaningful comparison states. Delta care vaccinated, still infect you. vaccinated people stay alive/out hospital. Dude, I'm sure even replaying to, said nothing conversation comment. say this. one knows immune system ""so strong could never die covid"" bloody people going around saying ""have immune system reason"" ""I' eat clean exercise, covid can't touch me"" stupidest humans alive. Every single person died gotten seriously ill covid immune system!!! one. many quiet undiagnosed autoimmune diseases could immune compromised know it. could happen 18 80! what, immune system. I'm happy you. one too. people died, everyone else. Taking approach rolling dice know odds. Because... know... 100% know, immune system going fight off? don't. 

Vaccines obviously better choice winging it. cares much vaccine helped person survive vs immune system? Like bloody cares? care fact vaccinated people tend get sick enough fill ICUs put us lockdown. care, double vaxxed means less risk family, coworkers, community. That's matters. Well that‚Äôs first called conservative. won‚Äôt long numbers become disinformation fuel antivax: ‚Äúsee, chances infection higher vaccine!‚Äù US almost never uses alternates well could year need to, losing one rough. 

I think read another article even could train again, due Tokyo protocols she‚Äôll quarantine 10 days fly home. chance potential competition, even she‚Äôs asymptomatic, unfortunately. Sorry think Alabama west due bad education system horrible equality. I'm surprised California absolutely ravaged Covid 10th time. want us tell you?

If you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre protected. I‚Äôm honestly sure you‚Äôre still worried you‚Äôre even asking for. believing case numbers dumb fully reopened 2 years whenever there's even one case somewhere area shut something would happen numbers made Yawn. Thank definition reinfected, already tried explaining. I‚Äôll post you

In general, reinfection means person infected (got sick) once, recovered, later became infected again. Based know similar viruses, reinfections expected. still learning COVID-19. Ongoing COVID-19 studies help us understand:

It says infected again. sick again. symptomatic. infected. happen anything. recover chicken pox exposed daily. Congrats infected daily basis. sick though. sorry coming across rude insanely naive insanely dumb. cant tell is. probably american. sorry insulting style holy shit helpful all. thanks. news works kids eligible vaccines yet? many Americans waiting news travel Canada. trip booked late August I'm thrilled see wonder much potential income lose cancelled events. Back day option view turning NBC, less events wouldnt change anything. would fill time different event move on. every single event money grab. lose even one major event huge loss. Heaven forbid... I'm still surprised Olympics going ahead. easiest 'I told so' planet offered date. still hope anyone gets sick turns okay suffer avoidable. Let guess. voted Yellow Boy Trump. üòÇ never really happened first place tbh. never like people arrested standing line home Depot anything. even deadlier variant develops selfish idiots, I'm leaving house. I'm going stay hermit. Genuine question--is wife encouraged get flu shot every year? I'm thinking guy can't afford hesitant towards vaccines masks more. mention compliant he'll medications out. Yeah find weird especially considering places like New York City seem fine hard needle thread. Delta serious variant dangerous also people straight lying vaccines working want tell better people vaccinated wearing masks. big problem. Yup. snagged lungs transplant list someone didn‚Äôt bring could used. deny alcoholics liver transplant, least delay hopefully get healthier. 

I don‚Äôt wish kid die, man‚Äînone necessary. 3 days cold-like symptoms. got tested using home test buy CVS. Came back positive. Next day got PCR test confirm it. 1 day true flu-like symptoms (slept day, achey, etc etc), fever, made extremely manageable. day ‚Äúflu day‚Äù, immediately back feeling like common cold another 3 days. essentially it. So...vaccines 95% effective real world setting. swear heard somewhere before... I've heard September application approval, I've also seen mid winter. Fingers crossed ready soon safe Wait‚Ä¶ catch covid even fully vaccinated ? agree. saying vaxx mandate next best would masks again. agree really know exactly ballance masking masking implemented. That's difficult issue. point mask clearly doable. Stores etc. Office characters perhaps. Starting Creed, ending Dwight. Phyllis would middle. she‚Äôs one I‚Äôd medium suspect. Nope. athletes refused get vaccinated IOC requiring it. tl;dr version. Breakthrough infections possible extremely rare mostly people underlying conditions. people said, ""vaccines fully protect anymore"" liars. vast majority you, take vaccine worry covid. Great info. Thanks, gayfetus. happened LA I'm California, feels like part issue people sorting social circles vaccination status. seeing friends vaccinated. presume friends vaccinated seeing other. instead single social circle 50% people vaccinated, two social circles, one 100% vaccinated one almost 0% vaccinated. 

Herd immunity thresholds assume people mix evenly, reality move big herd, move small packs, plenty packs one protected vaccinated friends packs.  called yet. would say it‚Äôs important study situations lot learned them. 

If read article provide examples could improved restrictions.
They approved positive tests 40 hours old, person could gotten infected elsewhere time festival.

Some people barely gotten first vaccine week fully vaccinated. 

It‚Äôs 1,000 infected people spread however many people fact. Rare unheard of. pisses off- ‚Äúsmall percentage‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean nobody. small percentage still people refused want risk side effects competition. paper might interest you. Delta changed lot past assumptions.

I wonder fast gov act changes update advice. Vaccines evenly distributed. areas near 90, others stunningly low. someone explain Japan low vax rate? agree instead talking COVID showed hospital footage would different spot make living without vaccine impossibly difficult basically untenable. can't send kids school unvaccinated, can't get denied health insurance without vaccine, fired vaccinated, denied entry without proof vaccination case count high enough. France made semi-mandatory record amount people sign up. naming convention would use Greek reaches end? Maybe Star names proximity? Alfa Centauri Variant sound pretty ominous. false. Israel 56% population fully vaccinated. Source : hope find peaceful rest night. sorry done family. HAHAHA please say thousands behavioral health scientists work there..This first pandemic us &amp; dealt with. mention lack funding. That's really awesome they're that! least numbers getting lost... link? I'd like read it. 7 minutes mask record I've broken 2 year old. Let's see hit 7 min 30 seconds next trip grocery store. wondered, used ""assist"" would use ""attend"". :) (""assister"" French ""to attend"", go something... ""attendre"" French ""to wait"", pass time something happens... languages confusing!). definitely big problem fake experts telling people vaccines good enough anymore basically 0 evidence repeatedly using timesofisrael article. said, board representative people. one thing cases control implement mask mandate people wearing masks fully vaccinated underlying conditions basically left version people buy 600 firearms protect gubmint invasion. Moderna, Sanofi TranslateBio independently working thing.  Unfortunately Delta mother transmissible variants vaccines alone aren‚Äôt enough prevent infection. Masks absolutely needed.

...so what's proposed end-game? need lot PSA‚Äôs TV showing dying people saying make mistake did, get vaccinated ASAP. strongly dislike stupid people! Oh no!

Anyway.... Also LA. I‚Äôve 5 fully-vaccinated friends test positive Covid last two weeks. 4 symptomatic. Three said nurse gave results didn‚Äôt ask vaccinated. told another thread don‚Äôt ask, reporting happens automatically? states well vaccinations actually well followed mandates?


I'm Indiana functionally real mask mandate since last fall.  read article, actually talks needs improve far requiring vaccination passports proof negative test result. 

There mistakes could avoided hopefully lead cautious action future festivals.  Thanks done. Hope find peace. us think vaccines work vaccines less common others?

I trying get vaccine appointment. noticed places seem Moderna vaccine. places Moderna JnJ vaccine. Basically nowhere Pfizer vaccine.

Why discrepancy? produced amount? Yes actually. N95s allow 5% penetration. takes less % viral load become infected. know amount viral load determine get infected not. takes less get infected. 1,000 infections 20,000 attendees....so infection rate like 5%? Yawn. even story? 

The vaccine 100% effective one ever said was, yes, big gathering going lead spread infections. Without requiring proof vaccination probably would lot 1,000 infections lot people might wound hospital. 

Sometimes feel like media done much damage anti-vaxxers treating every little outbreak like huge event.  much immediate, long term, vote.  replying person (who replied question) said ‚ÄúAll team would eligible‚Äù.   

Eligible? guess technically yes. Able actually get it? depends stuff wrote helping essentially arguing vaccines work Possibly, isn‚Äôt proof vaccine? says vaccine, negative test, recent infection. You‚Äôre probably getting downvotes zero-risk life impossible always been. need rediscover concept acceptable risk. yes absolutely jobs. Stop downplaying problematic is. certain cases (pre-vaccine) benefits clearly outweighed costs. theres free vaccine. Make everyone get vaccine, stop fucking masks. He's way risk delta variants. 

The kind astonishing thing mass media done face earlier pandemic narratives said ""only"" vaccinated risk people hospitalized high rates vaccinated low risk people fine. Like what? always knew risk people risk. much safer vaccine? None articles really explain efficacy risk folks miss opinion. amount people density India, I'm worried India breeding ground COVID. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. It‚Äôs hard pass me. done need wear mask. loved ones either fully vaccinated already infected antibodies. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Anybody ‚Äúchokes death‚Äù unvaccinated, well made choice. wacko conspiracy theorist make said hard understand. Flattening curve permanently getting vaccinated. get unflattened. Theres conspiracy theory lock everyone down. even make sense businesses losing money lockdown. whole theory nonsense. many athletes wont able compete. fair. cancel games‚Ä¶ feel bad healthcare workers go could avoided. athletes...not vaccinated?   Government officials politicians blatantly told everyone they‚Äôd get normal lives back following vaccination.

Probably grossly underestimated number morons living US. tell people got laid employer bar restaurant. worry piece cloth right!? FYI lot people getting super ill getting fully vaccinated. 12 people retest positives caught mass testing individually confirm cases.
Mass testing conducted pooling multiple samples one test, multiplying speed catch potentially infected individuals. (Ex. Testing X people high sensitivity test, positive, test separately high accuracy test)

China's ""oriental"" neighbours largely societal roots Chinese societal traditions community individual, common factor could sway it. Additionally direct experience SARS definitely cautious prepared us. (My province actually stockpiled PPE first SARS outbreak, left expire instead rotating out) still underplaying bad mask mandate people. example bars/restaurants cant open mask mandate lay people off. ""nothing"" vaccines better masks mandate masks vaccination. gain denying science?

Votes. Plain simple. 

But that's really discussion [another 12 hour ban sadly agree thinking. that's said ""knowing"" people U.S. hint lifting masking ANYONE means minds ""okay cool I'll act like I'm vaxxed also. Who's gonna check?"" Sad  tell Republican hospital there's horse running loose it.  make vaccine mandatory. Masks needed people get vaccinated. UK‚Äôs peak cases occurred exactly two weeks peak hospitalizations. We‚Äôve talking 2-week hospitalization lag year now. Stop making things don‚Äôt know. RSV also going nuts New Zealand.

For people, better analogy would Stanley Cup champions playing game bunch five year olds. suppose chance five year olds manage score Stanley Cup champions, highly unlikely something would live fear of.  clearly people want it. public social media do. big part reason people get vaccinated. mum warrior. watched video mid-pandemic ICU ward losing patients every day. hope heals enjoys retirement fullest username tho, lol difference might rates vaccinations two cases.

That's exactly why. low vaccination rates, Delta hitting hard. Yeah, much something like Delta make near impossible? I'm seeing numbers around 95% people need fully vaccinated get boosters. see happening. probably [EU Digital COVID rolling month. looks like effictivity current dominant strains pretty mediocre first dose robust second. true AZ mRNA vaccines. I‚Äôd treat unvaccinated one shot. problem country applies states. counties states high vaccination rates others don't. logic applies counties. towns given county high vaccination rates others don't.

Which gets worse smaller go people local areas.

Really, persisted. Worth considering though almost infections unvaccinated people including countries. Israel example 60% country least one dose; 5.5 million people got dose hundred contracted COVID that's society pretty much restrictions excepta restrictedd national border. Honestly give shit DV. Instead leaving negativity would rather explain increasing visitation rights good thing hospitals.   course are. continue selfish gits hellbent destroying reasonable society. We've gone full anti-vax. Bible belt big Q buckle. üòî That‚Äôs cool you. I‚Äôm exactly situation. Rural unvaccinated kids. get angry community caring kids. Maybe I‚Äôm naive would remove ""could be"" title add ""are"" instead. virus care fda hasn‚Äôt approved vaccine lol guess talking herd immunity?

That's really hard line. 50% enough? No, better 49%. closer get 100% safer everyone be. understand going get votes they're dead. Edit: oh wait. vaccine gave covid... Damn people ignorant  Uh‚Ä¶. Ok üëå seems bueno full blown horse shit, 20 governors different states claiming 33 cases each.  know spike seeing lot patients ineligible demographic though? Measles never ‚Äúgone‚Äù US. Measle still despite outbreaks ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù US. means it‚Äôs endemic circulating country. 


The polio virus that‚Äôs still circulating vaccine derived. comes oral polio vaccine. 

Here‚Äôs link also noted vast majority population immune diseases eradication programs started. 

Small pox vaccines different give disease, cow pox. It‚Äôs modern vaccine. kind like getting cold immune Covid life. Also took 180 years eradication. Nah delta higher. Newer studies pointing high 8.5 Haha yea many best photo ‚Ä¶ though hopefully he‚Äôs getting SECOND dose lol.

Ugh stupid people ruining society! What‚Äôs point get vaccinated still wear mask. look if, fine it‚Äôs choice get vaccinated suffer consequences decision. stupid people (well LA county least) wear masks again. 

Thank god I‚Äôm next door LA county choice wear mask choose. 

Which flu (not Covid) wore mask help minimize spreading viral load others. 

Asia waaaay ahead us mask wearing you‚Äôd get sick. It‚Äôs practice still want use even long COVID COVID 2.0 aka delta variant leave us! floor shower pool!  Oh, found bottom bottomless pit bullshit asked excavator. nothing segregated neighborhoods. disinterest getting vaccinated. live predominantly black neighborhood mask usage low drop. vaccinations, brought distribution centers neighborhood sent people around encourage signing up, vaccination rates still super low here. People want blame charge, certain point there‚Äôs personal responsibility protect yourself. Good read. I'm fully vaccinated I'm scared I'm still going get it. Might bad form personally still want chance googled ‚ÄúUK Covid cases‚Äù got graphs Google. I‚Äôll let type Google link absurdly long. top graph cases third graph hospitalizations. two-week trend pretty evident. global pandemic multiple vaccines virus variants wild ultimate real-time experiment‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre even bothering collect data???

**cries data science**  yet seen. Many pandemics burned time. probably won‚Äôt vaccinate it, however. link?

But seriously, wanted give info Kara, put face story, speak. going go biographical detail, realized actually know much that, what's really interesting gymnastics career. thought that'd better way illuminate background, also meant least somewhat explain Great Ring SNAFU! 'Are'. got vaccinated would over. dumb. understand data would bad. Definitely help trust either. clean poop minimum wage? think meant transmissible, virulent. Cases adverse effects exceedingly rare.

Exactly point. cases 24 year olds getting double lung transplants covid. vaccinated people, took vaccine protection, required re-mask others incalculable risk? unsound supported science. Thank well. read table noticed didn‚Äôt state time length post 2nd dose. would think ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù would require time time period post second dose. Maybe refused necessary casting couch wise coaches vendetta. I'm dual boarded internal medicine pediatrics. certainly true less kids die direct covid infection, I've seen fair share COVID patient populations. mean kids free complications. Probably biggest complication see kids MIS-C multiorgan inflammatory syndrome lethal comes COVID infection. common enough see times per month like unheard of, kids get pretty sick get MIS-C. Otherwise age 10 kids pretty well, seen occasional case myopericarditis (heart inflammation) times cold symptoms. 

Honestly worry smaller long haul symptoms frequently overlooked, roughly 10% kids age 10-20 years still lose sense taste smell, younger kids seem less affected wonder much inability report symptoms appropriately. regardless.... permanently even partially lose sense taste smell age 10....well, fuck. Plenty athletes see lingering shortness breath exertion. There's also less common pathology that's described, heart failure, stroke. Extraordinarily uncommon there. know worth dancing devil to; like swimming thunderstorm. Yeah, risk getting struck lightening high....but risk avoid ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[you read MIS-C Please get vaccinated every body.  business indirectly. know hospitals 50-60% icu nurses leave jobs numbers went back within last two/three weeks due avoidable. account back tho    know doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs pretend. Love every time. also find especially worrisome, based numbers bulletin least. Wow interesting. work Amazon shipping warehouse Northeast Ohio. testing completely voluntary people can‚Äôt bothered it. one point guy ran daily testing was, don‚Äôt want say begging, asking people get tested could meet quota. They've already solved problems. nearly hard thing second time. point already working solution applying lessons learned. murica No? would give impression? go much technical details (I hope), tried convey gymnastics judging generally codified exact.

But like sport, judges/referee/umpire choose hardass enforcing certain rules. Think constitutes traveling basketball, gets penalty call soccer, tennis player gets time warning. often, even individual officials, governing organization issuing memo telling harsher enforcing certain rules.

In Kara's case, always extremely vulnerable harsher enforcement one particular rule. coaches never fixed vulnerability, multiple ways so!

It's tough fair part gymnastics officials, face-palm-inducing part coaches. judicial precedent vaccination, like [Jacobson v. (1905), friendly would endanger others.

I suspect even conservative justice upset established precedent, perhaps claims bodily autonomy, would also upset generational intent make abortion illegal.

No one requires citizens go college. something choose do. Colleges asking applicants vaccination records novel issue. least surprised colleges required smallpox vaccinations polio vaccinations past. Good point. Like Spanish flu guess It‚Äôs summer break, buddy. superintendent said mask mandate. refuses stand vocal idiots area. 6 year old homeschooled again, sadly. say zero risk? Zero risk 40% population refusing get simple vaccine two different things. Facts. Nature gonna nature, regardless inconvenient species.  already bought tickets hotel reservations. It‚Äôs tricky get days wanted literally said great. Everyone checking viewpoints. 
Also therapy everyone. also great. Check tough guy. Guarantee dude listens Joe Rogan. I'd vote that. Halloween might longer one night fall  Neither lying ignoring breakthrough cases. It‚Äôs absolutely going undermine faith vaccine don‚Äôt count cases level people. unvaccinated neighbor laughed face today unvaccinated hasn‚Äôt (yet) contracted covid, yet I‚Äôm fully vaccinated did. 

My testing place data intake saying got vaccinated, symptoms, tested positive. CDC stop counting? doesn‚Äôt fit narrative (and you) want. 

Just reiterate, agree - everyone get vaccinated, really wear mask too, exposed COVID, could still get sick, even vaccinated. I‚Äôm gonna lie people off-chance might panic. Panic what? sure received dislikes fair sentiment also share.  Early pandemic, unknown would affect children, know, 8 deaths 100,000. adults like 230 100,000. 

School protocol protect adults. 85% adults fully vaccinated, would eliminate need put measures slow community spread, would epidemiologists think herd immunity reached

Sad truth never happen, probably anywhere world, vaccine resistance.   Hang there, hope quittin time soon! Vaccinate ones educated parents early, hope catch rest they're hitting college walkup clinic meningitis flu hpv shots...and tell parents. school active cases covid, sure shit they'd better chance dying school car. people wearing masks allowing live gray line reality think correct. Again, metrics translate literally, extra cautious good idea. 

As aside, cases delta variant transmitted incidental contact, person walked past another person caught way. think Trump factor definitely contributing, also, swine flu reported kill otherwise healthy young people. endanger able get vaccine

Then people take unnecessary virus continue spread mutate could render vaccines less effective ineffective

Putting aside fact very, unlikely, every human going get vaccinated. That's reality. There's always going new variant. Plus current vaccines become ineffective, we'll make new ones. understand right? made COVID vaccine like 6 months, making new one every year insurmountable task. calculator see wearing tinfoil hat. things mention don‚Äôt change fact measures proposed longer likely never backed science. can‚Äôt provide evidence mask mandates work. certainly necessary % vaccinated population.

Just stop. understand anger here. situation none us dealt before. really shocking understanding, thus medical mandate, changes? covid's bullshit done us. Ok, lets look beginning wave. 

Between 10/3 10/10, 7-day average cases gone 7,249 15,832 (up 118%)

Meanwhile, 2 weeks later 10/17 - 10/24 7 days average hospitalizations went 5,301 8,087 (up 53%).

Again, Fauci said (for deaths applies hospitalizations ‚ÄúOne 20-year-old infects another 20-year-old infects another 20-year-old infects Grandma. eight 10 weeks,‚Äù Fauci said.

I.e get protection original virus original guide lines Delta 100% contagious measures need double also get theoretical protection. Asymptotic ‚Äúdisease‚Äù doesn‚Äôt spread virus close contacts.

Seriously stop spreading nonsense. That's completely wrong.  Asymptomatic exactly nothing contagious someone is. literally means exactly says - experiencing symptoms. Nothing more.  contagious nothing symptomatic, infection itself.

Also edit disingenuous - asymptomatic also nothing ""affected spreading"".  asymptomatic person covid-19 affected spreading.  covid-19, contagious, unvaccinated, experiencing symptoms time.  I‚Äôm bashing anyone child 16. We‚Äôre talking CNA‚Äôs getting vaccinated, that‚Äôs trend. Mostly doesn‚Äôt take science degree become one, don‚Äôt understand vaccines well. Admittedly, OP used adjectives describing experiences, doesn‚Äôt portray CNA‚Äôs accurately. Basically see vaccines offers society short cut eliminate virus way Australia/New Zealand trying do.

If get 95% population vaccinated, including children, continue social distancing masking 2-3 months, would eliminated virus. Vaccines allow eliminate virus without lockdowns. vaccine really effective preventing infection. somewhat effective preventing severe outcomes infected, nearly much. divide deaths cases looking second effect, first. 

Also, vaccines over-repeesented vulnerable, among CFR much higher 1%.  fact article says. didnt actually require proof vaccination, required proof vaccination negative test covid. thing.  Oklahoma. passed law saying can't pass mask mandates schools death certificate data government's globally using might flawed. Countries may declare death heart attack. However, underlying cause heart attack might covid. Hence might get recorded covid death. people, want speculate who, made mask wearing specifically (and ""it's flu"" general) shibboleth show political affinity. Again, want speculate who, even contrived wedge issue costs many thousands lives. know worry health decisions, tune tucker Carlson ‚ÄúStudies across medical social sciences routinely show lose parents elevated risks depression related mental health challenges, higher risks criminal justice system involvement higher rates substance use, likely drop schooling less likely attend college,‚Äù Verdery said. ‚ÄúFurther line, know factors place individuals greater risk lower earnings, unemployment, poor physical health, relationship strains. extent, though literature tenuous here, likely greater risk early death.‚Äù

The long-term effects loss parent children basically another kind ‚Äúlong-haul Covid‚Äù ripple effects (both financial &amp; emotional) could last decades. US?

Firstly delta infections lagging behind UK 2-3 months. currently building steam takes time. 

The US focused heavily mrna vaccines offer slightly better protection symptomatic infection. theory would provide slight delay spreading asymptomatic spread much lower. Astrazeneca holds severe infections &amp; death really matters. UK Israel's experience 

But biggest reason bar none population density. Americans outside major cities fewer encounters covid daily basis. major cities high uptake tend lean ""liberal"" &amp; vaccination slightly political. never 
 US far ahead UK... Thoughts?

Yes states, others. adults right get jabs back April May 1st latest. absolutely age brackets 12+ right vacinated since May 26th. less age based demograpgic vulnerability things slowed people tend group age groups social settings.

Since know states lied number cases, certainly could correct. 

To honest, occurred me. trials looked 3 weeks, chose short time sake speeding trials speeding vaccine rollout. general, vaccines require multiple doses usually much longer periods time doses, usually months sometimes years. 

When comes vaccines, 3 week gap definitely good, extremely good fact. know that's studies looked at. Increasing gap probably makes either little better and/or longer lasting. would say know good 3 week gap, best thing get second shot soon possible (as long past 3 weeks) full protection present soon possible.  Masks help. Well, demonstrates head heights, confidence knot tying ability lack concern personal safety

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  love straight rooting virus lmao. Anyway single well regarded virologist thinks correct. Sorry come basement. Nothing statement ""incivile"". underlying conditions going around public yet. Another red herring.  red herring. one 100% safe anything. mask measles thats 95% effective? See stupid is? wrong. anyone know wait 4 weeks (UK) COVID get second vaccine (Pfizer)? COVID I‚Äôm scheduled second dose two weeks NHS recommends waiting 4 weeks ? Hi /u/kc44135, percentages misleading context population vaccinated adults much, much higher unvaccinated population adults, without context, comparison two percentages meaningless.

Imagine 100 blue sweets 10 red sweets. eat 1 blue sweet 1 red sweet. percentage consumed blue sweets 1% (1/100), percentage comsumed red sweets 10% (1/10). someone looked consumed sweets (2 sweets total), 50% consumed sweets red 50% blue.

So what's happening percentages. 'consumed sweets' hospitalisations looks like lot people vaccinated hospitalised especially context unvaccinated people. **However,** almost 90% population received least 1 dose (\~70% received doses), \~10% unvaccinated. words, population vaccinated individuals (blue sweets) lot greater unvaccinated (red sweets). see percentage hospitilations amongst vaccinated lot small unvaccinated, hence '40%' figure meaningless really provide much context effective vaccines are.

Hope clears things bit you; let know want go anything quite make sense you. 100% back said even used completely different country using different vaccines actually disprove point. good god. think CDC exaggerating encourage vaccination uptake. look forward seeing facebook feed. Yikes. Incentives? Suspicious. No. 40% 1 jab more. based sister , mother niece. cases, corrected number, people double jabbed, 

It's 60% unvaccinated 40% single double dosed individuals.  misunderstood said. claim vaccine acceptance would get rid variants, rather refusing make problem worse. article quotes experts argue this. misunderstood said. claim vaccine acceptance would get rid variants, rather refusing make problem worse. article quotes experts argue this. Well herd Immunity seems like utopia, starts feel like SotF steroids Travel UK banned since March 2020. all, vaccines working great, situation complicated that.

Delta seems R0 least 5, possibly 8. rough calculation herd immunity 1/R0 - sterilising immunity 80% population (possibly higher), whether acquired vaccination infection.

At moment Scotland 10% unvaccinated adults, 17% unvaccinated children 18% single dose. Single dose 30% effective preventing illness, two doses 80%. numbers improve course, fair proportion unvaccinated immune already Covid.

So we're still going see spike numbers people susceptible infection well 1/R0, given seem better we've fair chance better mitigation England. still expect shite hitting fan numbers, absolute disaster that's stalking English.

Of course vaccines work infection profile younger going like last couple times, still think 20,000 UK dead consequence awful lot young people debilitated post viral syndrome. could avoided holding back everyone second jab keeping place measures control infections meantime. Covid hasn‚Äôt stolen time. It‚Äôs like sent prison. Make you‚Äôve got.  comment asinine arguing something headline say. states anti-vaxxers could contribute problem, possible vaccinate everyone right now. Back you, Diane Well pisses far likely get sick COVID rare reaction vaccine.  Haha Whoosh.  Yet talk bringing mask mandate back in... Imagine new worst deadly variant comes Israel. unluckily possible, good luck explaining comes unvaccinated kids.

I'm totally pro vaccines let's honest moment concrete reason pro vaccines high vaccinated zones delta much surge cases, indonesia, tunisia, russia india disaster. already enormous fact. Funny vaccine. Sorry life Reducing symptoms? hell smoking. Sorry, misread then. wording bit awkward.  Unicron variant Vaccines protecting vaccinated disease death. That's it!

Vaccines definitely stop infections. Vaccines may stop transmission either (good data lacking).

Since know much virus shed vaccinated people asymptomatic infections, asking tested perhaps worst public health decision. Throwing caution wind clearly working Netherlands right now. That's extremely charitable take federal judiciary. also misreading comment. I'm simply saying he's appointee conservative. I'm pasting post wrote yesterday (using deaths hospitalisations point there). ratio vaccinated unvaccinated misleading almost meaningless own.

Your dad exactly safe expected would vaccine programme rolled - risk death hospitalisation completely eliminated reduced drastically.

\--

Some quick back envelope calculations involving hypothetical disease:

You invent vaccine 90% effective preventing death (pretty bloody good efficacy) persuade 90% people take (ruddy good uptake too).

What proportion people dying would expect vaccinated?

Well every 100 people would died pre-vaccination wave:

- 10 vaccinated still die

- 9 remaining 90 die

- 81 survive.

So deaths decline 81%, almost half die vaccinated people (9/19).

Stats like one headline keep getting thrown around manner likely lead vaccine hesitant people interpret headline suggesting vaccines best ineffective, worse, deadly. aren't. people say okay getting covid shot every year even though covid mutate years basis scientists ahead  Yes, disaster government formally apologized. shot required months. difference point people would reacted fear terror told numbers advance, justified not.

And now, pandemic certain define lives entire generation, instead asking ""How mitigate this?"" many people asking ""How define close enough normal anything it?"" terrible us parents put situation. little appreciation left humanity. Nah really? wonder changes fact statistically going severe symptoms covid least 95%? telling unvaccinated people get vaccinated. goals right now? resorting personal attacks, written communication, strong suit...? would make bad (arguably worse) parent anti-vaxxer.

Thanks. want make sure understand. U.S./CDC, time get ahead variant. ball court. Whoops...   Damn, numbers lie. That's crazy asians twice vaccinated blacks. mean, expected highest number, that's ridiculous. Exactly. think people really understand contagious virus is. good visual think people smoking/vaping. aerosol plumes cover lot area several feet away person infected. like think like smelling neighbors bbq aroma. don‚Äôt understand they‚Äôre reading mask lol. I'm saying stay home 24/7 40% cases, corrected number, people double jabbed, recovering home needed hospitalization, cases serious enough require attention away home Yep. argument also used way around anti-vaxxers helping create milder version virus. 

The truth know first Pfizer shot 04/24, get second shot 07/23? waited long? I've reading conflicting things online idk what's accurate Peoples option get vaccinated months ago, point. hate west coast part country ffs. people working quantum engineering integrated fucking circuits cattle fuckers Louisiana fuck all. Suburbs vs cities. actually less True. trends 30%, number, kids impacted, eventually scale cases going again. information we‚Äôre hoping for. Although wonder get still get kinds sick even vaccinated? remember someone posted saying lost sense smell numbers example compute. describe vaccine ‚Äúbetter 95% effective preventing hospitalization.‚Äù 950 vaccinated, 4 hospitalized, would 99.6% effectiveness. I‚Äôm double vaccinated I‚Äôm done masks. It‚Äôs still mandatory work unfortunately don‚Äôt wear mask I‚Äôm putting on. Population density huge effect well. county densely populated others? say bit long lasting effect arm received mine. shoulder extremely sore/stiff week shot, even still hurts pickup kids find favoring shoulder (although getting better 2+ months later).

I‚Äôm fairly certain injected joint muscle. got shot hurt particularly bad (and never minded shots before), noted guy put awfully high arm/shoulder. I‚Äôve read bit fluids shot administered sorta hang joint taking time work area surrounding muscle (which noticed I‚Äôve using it, less pain noticing).

I would absolutely get shot heartbeat though! would make sure inject little bit away joint, haha. 

If athlete got side effect could see would debilitating‚Ä¶ said, probably would best trained staff perform injection would pretty much negate risk contracting particular side effect. Man anything make seem better sticks. FALSE!!! CDC GUIDELINES RECOMMENDED 10 days far back december 2020.  Damn plague keeps giving... seems psychological thought found almost anti-vaxers expected consequence loss. want feel empowered. So, common, easy reject perceived risk. Yes, irrational, them, rational.

To me, appear simple cognitive dissonance. want empowerment.

IMO approach cannot one scientific claims, accepted facts anti-vaxers. tell vaccinated circle know, one's going restaurants recent weeks. Everyone already watching Delta. Back take outs, delivery, home cooking, outdoor picnics. get it, anti vaxxers taking vaccine, telling unvaccinated people get vaccine. anti vaxxers care. somehow care, yet friends told 95% chance hospitalized vaccinated. Something add up. say unvaccinated people need vaccinated, care, affect you? want anti vaxers vaccinated bad? make sense now? example showing 95% vaccination likely hospitalized, 40% hospitalizations vaccinated means high effectiveness.

More 95% population 65 fully vaccinated, 65 made overwhelming majority hospitalizations:  Thanks support! pretty great Damn hospital rate 16% Covid vaccine, basically states vaccine close completely ineffective Thank you! Indeed! want paranoid rest life, guest. huge numbers laughable face 20-fold higher numbers.

If 20x less deadly would treated like flu. Put flu comparison slide deck away already. covid before, guys think new delta variant still kill extreme get it? Ok, sperm don‚Äôt swim well, less likely meet egg. Fewer pregnancies. means? funny thing I'm sure masked people vaccinated, unvaccinated masking. anyone back ""stay home"", ""only go groceries curbside"" ""back virtual gatherings"" mode due prevalence Delta variant? Misinformation, conspiracy theories sociopathy one comment? Well I'd never expected coincide! would like know aswell $20/hr??? Damn! ask kidding? Literally 40% hospitalized patients UK double vaccinated *those* comorbidities elderly. front center news story increased case rates UK imagine worried sick loved ones. Somewhat good reason covid around tbh. Same. Worst December. asymptomatic butNever want go even worse. fear parents getting We've pandemic year half. going away own. We've already employed lockdowns social distancing we're still half million new cases/day. Global vaccination viable strategy. Mmmm....most understaffed YEARS! I‚Äôm sorry VACCINATED Missourians I‚Äôm sorry go this. Vulnerable ppl hardest protect. used post Gene Tierney pregnancy story FB page time time. thought ppl would read think ‚Äúoh! take precautions ppl! get now!!!‚Äù. dumb. üòÇ üòÇ üòÜ  says they're investigating cause. could plenty things cause symptoms lifting like that. Especially young. Certainly interesting proof yet 24 year old guy w/o kids wear cloth mask minimum inside shared spaces. Located NW Chicago Suburbs. vaxxed since early May.

Maybe values German parents taught wearing mask part good citizen imo. different voting paying taxes shoveling snow sidewalk front house. understand wearing protects others germs somewhat protects others germs. understand helping protect neighbors can't get vaxxed vaccines effective for. 

That's part society me. Japanese athletes testing positive?  yes, stabilized again. Netherlands thorough demonstration opening early. need way higher vaccination numbers open up. entire office 35 people got Pfizer months ago, two people refusing get vaccinated Japanese person (he's allergic mRNA vaccines apparently manufactured Japan) Russian woman waiting ""safe.""

""You can't trust government,"" assures us. Even though... wait it... government. Pfizer isn't.

ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£üòÇ Indiana gotta Indiana... Except good analogy. wearing seatbelt primarily safety, choice. transmissible disease affects people too, **not everyone wants vaccinated can.** Kids 12 years old make 17% population. We've never real mask mandate. minute Holcomb announced mandate fines criminal penalties, legislature threatened take emergency powers away, took penalties. basically strongly-worded recommendation.

Plus, think single police department country actually enforcing mask mandates, unless already arresting someone something else. here‚Äôs weekly post changes rhetoric vaccine. motility, motivity. sperm people :D I‚Äôm fully maskinated, I‚Äôm always wearing mask. based Sunday's testing  kids 12 don‚Äôt matter reddit :( thousand old people. 950 vaccinated. 4 got put hospital. 50 unvaccinated, 6 got put hospital.

Where getting numbers from? make sense. ‚ÄúRalphie... get stage sweetheart!‚Äù Nope. gladly offer good PR government compensation. I'm glad putting information there. know multiple vaccinated people who've got sick. Luckily young ride unpleasant 2 weeks home, many people seem think they're fully protected true. 

Personally find mask small price pay getting sick, even mild. distancing go full lockdown avoiding bars/concerts/trains/gatherings.  like shoving commercials inside throat last year, need shove vaccine commercials throat  much this, also what‚Äôs ‚Äúso vaccinated people wear
masks again??‚Äù dumb shit, like ok antimaskers never wore responsible people still did, sure wearing mask outside huge burden brings everyone collectively down. let stupid people stupid, doesn‚Äôt mean be, especially hard lol think all
Could avoided people gotten vaccinated. Skip checks offer tax credit hospital, 65.5% unvaccinated.

You final numbers flipped. matches earlier estimates vaccine efficacy hospitalization, right? CDC jumped gun forgot, America done masking. matter CDC said ok mask not, people already beginning unmask. Old Testament guidelines disease control? I‚Äôm sure people don‚Äôt care vaccinated moment would right messaging (this would probably good majority unvaccinated young people), maybe wouldn‚Äôt futile. However feel like key addressing find get confirmation vaccine reduces Long COVID risk

I also agree vaccinating Third World unused Western Vaccines would probably prove beneficial fight new variants goading unvaccinated Western Countries ever pet names hats pull numbers of?

There's countries delta variant spread along they're certainly seeing significant hospitalization rate (40%) vaccinated partially vaccinated far cry 97% admissions unvaccinated. delta variant still getting started expected become dominant strain. Current vaccines 70-80% effective delta variant. noted people Pfizer vaccine vaccine still heavily protected severe symptoms Covid related complications mortality. key. protects death/severe upper respiratory issues. doesn‚Äôt overload health care system fuck supply chain up. get infection show side effects theyre 95%ish mild. 10 days course disease person little symptoms. 

It recommended wait 24 hours symptoms disappear considered safe. Forms produce harder symptoms take bit clear. 

14 days used metric beginning 72 hours disease run course way prevent outliers. trust numbers coming US without scrutiny. know here, unlike UK Israel, patients getting tested asked vaccination status protocol? would useful information, right? CDC want count vaccinated infections. hospitalizations death. Why? weekend immune system much different weekday one. Drink beer weekends! I‚Äôm vaccinated, vaccines better defense Covid compared masks. Well that‚Äôs fucking great!  Advice. chances likely higher getting severe complications long hauler even death acquiring Covid vs supposed Dysreflexia. laugh see people STILL wearing wrong mask mandates gone. Why? could understand insufferable ass bag wear it, even required? working. vaccinated older people health problems mostly. Think way, population 100% vaccinated, 100% hospitalized would vaccinated too, mean effective reducing hospitalizations 1000 10 per unit time though. 

All data saying young, healthy unvaccinated better protection old/vulnerable vaccinated, current status UK young people largely unvaccinated. american, I'm going recommend that. Thoughts family, sounds awful. hope able somehow support mother many unvaccinated? WE. ALREADY. KNEW. THIS.

But, thank information. anybody know organizations pushing return mitigations US (mandatory masks, gathering size limits, etc.)? frustrated watching situation. like watching train crash see coming hundred miles many care. half country going get vaccinated putting even vaccinated risk, would least like advocate mitigations know go so. would like join sort cause people want eradicate virus extent possible stop dilly-dallying. I'm informed enough know everything would involve obviously pushing get vaccines countries enough US, since many get vaccinated, push mitigations. groups like minded people? seems like government level tolerance harm much higher. Right seems like Israel country taking seriously. Hoping Greyhound starts running soon!  Indeed I'm getting 2nd dose upcoming weekend (unless doctor recommends given first reaction joint pain 2 weeks went away I'm pretty sure lol. (Pfizer)

Speaking tomorrow. 

She said inflammatory response possibly due previously covid Nov 2020 hard say 

I first dose May 28th I'm getting 2nd July 23th 

I've seen people experience big first reaction much 2nd almost opposite people experience.

My mom reactions 2nd worse bit symptoms 2 days.

 (She basically asymptomatic covid lost smell taste 2 days that's it) may waited long get 2nd doses go around recommended wait 4 months time.

Here still 8 weeks got text saying book 7 weeks. 

My girlfriend sore arm first dose (also covid)

The people immediate family getting dad (believes previous infection good enough)

And younger brother never caught hesitant abd trust it. he's anti vax thinks immune system fine fight despite autoimmune condition recently going immuno suppressant drug.

But know said might get needs travel Mexico next year. Please give one clear example CDC actually giving sound timely advice since beginning pandemic. I‚Äôd love hear it.

""get vaccine die"" fuel suspicion. baseline comfortably bearable death risk established previous peaks, people bother exceeded. things turned right before, they?

It's still normalcy bias, way around. even worse many ones going hospital unvaccinated potentially unhinged. know several nurses quit looking different work due stress treated patients. Yes. That's crazy! Except enact sort revenge.

I'm saying would beyond something Johnson would say, perfectly plausible, man proven can't trusted. shipping faster testing‚Ä¶  Don‚Äôt Fauci federal resources. covid jabs, vaccine too. looks like special info campaign stop people vaccinating. Everybody afraid getting autism vaccines. Even medical staff. going decades. He's way risk delta variants.

Source this? don‚Äôt remember seeing definitive proof delta lethal, contagious  mask socially distance eternity, enough people vaccinated slows community spread. longer people wait get vaccinated, variants though, thanks screwing us, vaccine ""hesitant"" people. anybody know rest world sees United States half population take vaccine spite BS information.

There lot people take they're waiting see, seems normal me. month two assume large mass people get vaccine.

I spinal cord injury I'm waiting get vaccine link spinal cord injuries side effect Dysreflexia, causes extremely high blood pressure getting vaccine.

I can't find information percentage people spinal cord injuries gotten j reflexia, already slightly high blood pressure, people spinal cord injuries get walking around. Especially called lies admits lying, basically says time I'm telling truth, honest.

Very credible. Thank link. sure hope happens? UK, update us going. literally proven transmissible cause hospitalization. Texas, governor (in May?) forbid schools requiring masks. county 33% vaccination rate steady number months. think vacc numbers 12-18 year Olds roughly 15% county - (adults teens) much lower surrounding counties.

The times I've store lately I've seen maybe one two people wearing masks.  ""a lot people"" scientific term. 100 people lot, depending context. think *a lot people* think *a lot people* think pandemic simply following CDC guidelines going beyond that. wear mask anywhere indoors, think vaccinated aren't, believe pandemic over.

We sensationalize everything, time. People different risk assessments, that's all. feel perfectly OK potential breakthrough case. terrified mind. company (a well known fortune 50 company) particularly risk adverse, done *anything* encourage people get vaccinated. got covid let take much time needed, didn‚Äôt count sick time vacation time. 

I love working here. culture great, benefits top notch, pay good, can‚Äôt believe didn‚Äôt even send ‚Äúplease get vaccinated‚Äù email. Waiting school districts mandate vaccine teachers staff. Won‚Äôt happen upcoming school year expect FDA fully approves, required fall 2022. Read here, good redditors: this:

PARIS, July 18 (Reuters) - France reported 12,500 new coronavirus cases Sunday, third day tally held 10,000, quick spread contagious Delta variant COVID-19 led jump new infections.

The health ministry, however, said 12,532 new cases reported Sunday, took total 5.87 million, included data published day before.

""The daily figure published today (+12,532) therefore interpreted exceptional increase number daily cases, context nonetheless strong dynamics evolution number cases,"" said note posted website.

The ministry reported 10,949 cases Saturday 10,908 Friday.

France also reported 891 people intensive care units new coronavirus Sunday, one previous day, total number deaths hospitals rose five 111,472.  AFAIK Israel also count asymptomatic cases citing lower efficacy rate. efficacy symptomatic disease likely higher, especially using longer dose intervals 3 weeks.

We know Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines less effective delta, certain loss efficacy great Israeli claim. good place buy n95's make sure they're actually legitimate fake? Getting plane couple weeks even though I'm vaccinated kids want take best precautions can. Thanks. tell sick. expect fraction cases vaccinated go time anyway, vaccination rates increasing. instance, everybody vaccinated, 100% cases would vaccinated people, even highly effective vaccines. It‚Äôs simply tied political identities view virus. poster boy hero called hoax day one, held maskless rallies insinuating people don‚Äôt really need things like masks distancing. It‚Äôs like cult. programmed front it‚Äôs almost impossible reevaluate reassess. example, Fauci painted enemy. Fauci do? pleads people get vaccine. people‚Äôs minds, sticking evil liar Fauci refusing get vaccinated. Last least, let‚Äôs forget Tucker Carlson Fox News hosts waged daily smear campaign vaccine. purpose outcome? knows. Maybe it‚Äôs pure evil. Yep thought process. excellent theory. Sadly enough information since CDC really track breakthrough cases difficult say what's actually happening. That's lot better! true. recent week data effectiveness infection/hospitalization footnote denominator total hospitalizations undercounted, meaning actual hospitalization efficacy even higher. treated such

What suggest? know that. say policies RCFs. work separate mental health agency, every one RCFs privately owned operated. Hopefully eye opening folks. know lot already entrenched ideas won‚Äôt change, could get reporting like federal level, could help. They‚Äôve jabbed far many people approved. Imagine backlash legal claims turn round say aren‚Äôt safe.

Not chance that‚Äôll happen, might well pass Love VA need right. aducanumab debacle, amount scrutiny COVID vaccines facing, work must unimpeachable. ""over age 12"" 2 Let's hope HL3 variant... arrive never January like final deadline approval expected next 1-2 Scoot G believes late August possibility Pfizer. business say ""get vaccine longer work here"" without legal repercussion.

And stores say ""no vaccine, entry"" like already signs ""no shirt, shoes, service."" Every vaccine consenting recipient. find 1 person want it, there's 10 desperately want rejected dose. vaccine prevent infection seriously ill, effective protection 100% either.

With said, rise effections seems driven unvaccinated partially vaccinated young people. Hospitalizations deaths rise probably anywhere near previous waves. agree although increased testing gives us idea community spread whereas time hospitalizations soar it‚Äôs already late. Essentially, yes, Gov ended lifting mandate week early clear essentially new people getting vaccinated going create absolute feces show month school sets open. Like issues country, sh*t flying. mortality getting Delta vaccinated significantly lower regular flu? conservative areas 100% require masks. Bank it.  Yes long covid vaccinated people get breakout infection previously long covid? People wearing mask 30% vaccination rate county sucks. don‚Äôt want 4.5 mos able anything again. That‚Äôs year data iirc‚Ä¶hopefully passes  Eastern bloc countries never fail disappoint  new worst deadly variant comes Israel. unluckily possible, good luck explaining comes unvaccinated kids.

Yep, many ways virus mutate many directions. might co-infection MERS SARS-CoV-2 via recombination get worst two (highly pathogenic highly transmissible). infect particular animal get attenuated virus (this process used produce live vaccines). totally pro vaccines let's honest moment concrete reason pro vaccines high vaccinated zones delta much surge cases, indonesia, tunisia, russia india disaster. already enormous fact.

Completely right here. Let's hope ugly mutations show up. need beneficial ones. get glares Trader Joe‚Äôs wearing mask people chin do.   supposed do? got vaccine. encourage people it. weak masks (only required)

Less 15% fully vaccinated, Today 784 new deaths, compared last weeks time high 799. Everyone going get vaccinated, either tested, safe effective vaccine, dangerous natural immunization variable efficacy high rate side effects. compared children tested positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies October November 2020 tested negative. excluded children seronegative October November 2020 seroconverted retested March April 2021. March May 2021, parents reported symptoms children occurring since October 2020 lasting least 4 weeks, well whether symptoms persisted 12 weeks. questionnaire contained list predefined symptoms free-text October November 2020 March April 2021, 4 109 seropositive children (4%) vs 28 1246 seronegative ones (2%) reported least 1 symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks (see Table symptoms lasting beyond 4 12 weeks). frequently reported symptoms lasting 12 weeks among seropositive children tiredness (3/109, 3%), difficulty concentrating (2/109, 2%), increased need sleep (2/109, 2%). None seropositive children reported hospitalization October 2020. Similar proportions seropositive seronegative children reported excellent good study reports distribution symptoms compatible long COVID population level; capture severe SARS-CoV-2 infections rare children. strength study population-based seronegative control group. Limitations include relatively small number seropositive children, lack information exact time SARS-CoV-2 infection, possible misclassification children false seropositive results, potential recall bias, parental report child‚Äôs symptoms, lack information symptom severity, noncompletion questionnaire. Also, systematic differences existed children included vs included analysis, possibly affecting representativeness sample.  insignificant Well, speaks volumes! Hope see states countries displaying data way.  many age groups vaccination high 90%, guess expected 40%. is. 95% long haulers test PCR negative. Masks aren‚Äôt magic. you‚Äôre actually concerned, stay home. 100% seems highly unlikely. 99.9% maybe, 100% feels like made-up number general. Real numbers perfect.  illegal sanctions blockade imposed Trump let buy medicine, equipment vaccine frozen another clear example sanctions hurt kill innocent people far government. 

Biden not. He's vicious Trump international stage, see. seems crazy kids school aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Stricktest border control bit lies help lot.
In packed country like China contagious virus is, outbreak believe control it.

Thanks advance downvote CCP bots. :) glad did, us too. many here. safe. Indeed. There's lot variables taken account. Another fewer unvaccinated people would likely die person would otherwise infected vaccinated catch it.

However, meant model mirrors reality. simply show point ratio vaccinated unvaccinated people good measure people look at.

I keep seeing thrown around people concerned suggests vaccines working, truth.  really. run June 19 - July 9 effectiveness infection 97% effectiveness hospitalization/death 93% criminal offense, could kept lot things.  hypothetical disease assumes likelihood getting hypothetical disease change people get vaccine. practice people get vaccine might less cautious (because think immune) would shift numbers even towards vaccinated people dying. one arguing pandemic going go away ""on own,"" pursue strategy involves vaccinating many people possible. 

My point energetically everything else think well, since vaccinations multi-year strategy may may work given rapid constant emergence new variants virus difficulties vaccinating enough population achieve herd immunity. many drugs successful vitro, noticeable effect real treatment. surprised? Eastern bloc friend.  Sounds like another ""magic cure"".  One. father one closest friends. absolutely terrible health and, honestly, surprised lived long did. care home advanced cirrhosis dementia felt like years. caught covid hospitalized something unrelated. 89.

Outside that, I've know many people caught covid, one person minor symptoms days. Ages range 26 62. one hospitalized group. worse symptoms vaccine covid. say this, better job could. excuse adults vaccinated US. held hostage idiots. That‚Äôs life. saying it‚Äôs right wrong we‚Äôre products influence. She‚Äôs entitled free pass parents made believe, heavily influenced free will, vaccine wasn‚Äôt good time. Flash forward she‚Äôs got whole thing going on. risk, didn‚Äôt play well. 

At end day, virus spreads, protecting fellow athletes inconsiderate everyone else put work qualified. It‚Äôs world, consequences. drive across States, don‚Äôt need anything. Coming back Canada, need PCR NAAT test within 72 hours entry, whether fully vaccinated not. difference is, don‚Äôt quarantine vaccinated. 

If fly across, need least antigen test fly States. PCR NAAT test coming back. 3 day hotel quarantine fully vaccinated, still need another test airport flying August 9. don‚Äôt need quarantine waiting result 8 day test since fully vax. 

Either way, need show proof vaccination test results via ArriveCAN app. also need quarantine plan case come back positive. May 1st July 9th, 1 50 people died fully vaccinated. amazing, especially considering assume vulnerable vaccinated.

Also would include time range delta likely becoming dominant. [A universities case hospital work at, 80% staff vaccinated restrictions eased. we're back restrictions.


I Florida though, specified that. effectiveness going narrow closer present day. data July 9 kind worrying. It‚Äôs business‚Äôs personal choice mandate Im sorry, point?

Did admit vaccines aren‚Äôt effective? sounds like factors make severe illness extremely rare  would feel safe, like hanging idiots. honestly time problem it. fact hang small groups mostly people trust (ie: Wouldn‚Äôt conceal fact tested positive felt sick) may play role that. jammed packed large group people largely didn‚Äôt know like concert party good chunk people unvaccinated probably would feel little uneased know things take time can't rush science, really hope FDA working overtime get vaccines fully approved still maintaining safety standards.  current headline still less perfect. missing ""from covid"" portion. Stay away people don‚Äôt wear masks voluntarily  that's pretty far child services coming house. way dems this. End illegal sanctions blockade imposed Trump let buy medicine, equipment vaccine frozen assets.

This another clear example sanctions hurt kill innocent people far government. Wow awesome. Every state (federal level too!) something like this! graphic useless doesn‚Äôt take supply consideration. Pfizer deliveries ~40% lower July compared June, obviously vaccination rates going lower consequence. 

This notion everyone Europe wants vaccine gotten one simply bullshit. country expects offered everyone first jab September. Given number emails sent Floyd protests‚Ä¶I seriously doubt it. Like others said, data amazing. suggests vaccine lost almost efficacy delta (either infections, hospitalization death). Much better whats reported Uk Israel. People close to: Three. Two grandparents great aunt.

Lots people either acquaintances know someone knows someone (e.g. yesterday told older brother kid's godfather died COVID, one wife's second cousins 40's healthy died it.)

It's anecdotal asked for, given many people vaccinated seem like deaths gone mainly older people last year early year much younger people getting deaths recent months. Order Grainger. get 3M brand. might check places like Home Depot. criminal offense all, would barred lots places want liability covid outbreak. area, places like restaurants small businesses requiring vaccines, universities. come I'm sure. what's solution? stimulus happening, banning indoor businesses operating lead spike unemployment shutdowns. top that, two interlinked. *is* acceptable level get running? would go back period lockdown? herd immunity natural infection vaccines long boosters ready (if needed all). Currently evidence anyone 60 who‚Äôs immune compromised need booster quiet while. New mask mandates make - less - likely lockdowns move overton window. vaccinated people fight back re-instating mask mandates, governments go-ahead start lock-downs again. it‚Äôs IOC cares money anything else heaven earth. comes cost. One even willing acknowledge. &amp;#x200B;

great point Yeah don‚Äôt even pay attention anymore. Got sick getting hopes  1st question doesnt make sense people want indoor mask mandates want *effective* mask mandates, rules removing masks indoors.

Personally, dont care mandates. I'm gonna wear mask feel danger, know unscientific are, told want smell someone elses stink. something worse Delta comes along. Covid kills low percentage kills slowly (well host infected others)
So would selection pressure favor even less deadly variants? Kill ratio kill speed never impeded variants far There's country called Israel, Holocaust museums, countless amounts award-winning works literature art that's widely celebrated. 17% population practical purposes immune covid. Oh thanks. didn‚Äôt realize Reuters paywall maybe it‚Äôs sign in? &amp;#x200B;

Our university already mandated pushback Maine.  Yes, think understand. relatively unvaccinated UK, huge majority are. fact unvaccinated vaccinated sick hospital, percentage sick vaccinated people low relative massive amount people received vaccine means vaccines still working really well, even risk populations, correct? Dad likely still pretty safe given then? chance states. GA FL even reporting case data day anymore. think answered question. Believe plenty people live fear virus likely need much medical care infected. intentionally hang people dumb frankly. adults know vaccinated, one immune disorder, relatives dumb. know people like make political too, people know political opinions got vaccinated even anti-maskers.  restaurants thing always security theater part. argument would make mask mandates implemented protect people working buildings (e.g. restaurants) forced (e.g. schools.) point, places could see strong case mask mandate would schools, hospitals, etc.

But that's kind impossible case restaurants bars, unless mean making servers wear them, still illogical they're vaccinated. One big reason vaccines safe stop using ones safe enough.

""Safe"" measured relative level threat disease well current safest vaccine; levels serious adverse events we're seeing covid vaccines higher we'd tolerate non-pandemic context.

A years road surprised covid vaccines retired less safe alternatives. CEO probably watches Fox News think surpassed US first doses. there's that... It‚Äôs weird Jews always draw short end stick centuries. #Jews life matter wonder indoor mask mandate makes sense go restaurant bar take mask off. different security theatre?

The restaurants thing always security theater part. argument would make mask mandates implemented protect people working buildings (e.g. restaurants) forced (e.g. schools.) point, places could see strong case mask mandate would schools, hospitals, threshold getting rid is. People comply unless there's specific end goal.

I agree 100%, politician charge something I'd set target get certain percentage population vaccinated, see case numbers drop certain level tie ""reopening"" that. However, pretty much everywhere either open entire pandemic reopened long ago, work now. result, think clear threshold based case numbers sort lockdown mandated preventative measures. Like x% number positive tests result mask mandate, much higher y% positive tests result drastic things like school closures such. Unfortunately, nobody could really agree numbers never happened would even harder come now. else?! Chinese?!   unite all! 

The Chinese secretly converted Judaism! strain contagious virulent currently excellent vaccines work, masks certainly what's gonna keep controlled. year, significant reduction contagion we've vaccination efforts, stay home orders mask mandates came even close level control provided vaccinations alone.


It's absolutely pointless talk reinstating mask mandates roughly 50% people take vaccine wear masks anyway. Let's stop punishing people put effort far wearing masks year taking vaccines supposed to. question public health safety. Buddy, us children people think of. supposed put children risk want hurt feelings someone scared vaccine? Sorry, unless vaccinated welcome around me, shame selfish person are. 

People like holding society back. saw screen night game thinking wtf. could literally see mist, presumably yelling, hovering crowd. 

Wtf wrong people? Goes say number children hospitalized.

A number? number? anti-vax slogan, vaccines safe usual benefits vaccinating children outweigh risks Implying should. Learn speak political, lawyer. I‚Äôm talking daily thread. 

Every post variants top comment ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fully vaccinated, yet still wearing N-95 Whole Foods compassionate human being‚Äù followed thirty comments patting person back. saying 40% fully vaccinated?  thought hospitalizations fully vaccinated? isn‚Äôt Israel mostly vaccinated mRNA vaccines? effective delta others? cases people usually seem mild asymptotic. I‚Äôm pretty sure 1% hospitalizations deaths occur vaccinated people. That's fantastic, must feel like getting second chance normal life. relief. great trying hard. But, lest forget common petri dish claims pan out:  Feels like 1350 said would say are? There's data suggests 100% effective. 

Are astronaut? become one would jump right thinking know one throwing caution wind? 

Or experiencing brand new phenomenon knowledge can't make predictions would cautious take step step knowing probably make mistakes along way? 

Humans vector spreads Covid-19. solution stop spread modify behavior vector. Wearing masks, social distancing, restrictions gatherings, restrictions travel etc. way know reduce spread. true 98.9% people catch Covid-19 survive population 7 billion people equals nearly 100 million people died. Like analogy astronaut, Covid-19 new, people make mistakes, might overly cautious, save lives they're going Leroy Jenkins run wild throwing caution wind. expecting instant results good luck that. ever known time human history big problem presented fixed instantly? also visited Pinochet still dictator Chile. NO! defined 90% effective completely wrong! quote website ""With vaccine 90% effective, 9 10 people expected protected vaccine. 10% could still become infected could get sick."" think ‚Äútrusted science‚Äù vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread virus much. said, risk spread stuff patients? That's wonderful, I'm glad you! Well since I‚Äôm vaccinated, wouldn‚Äôt concerned health. wouldn‚Äôt really enjoy around people like that. lot great replies here, wanted say thank everyone taking time reply help understand going better. relieving know vaccines still working well, Dad still much better chances without. scientific guidance imploring us wear masks outdoors we're vaccinated time. said, personally think still good idea avoid large crowds whether masked not.  Perhaps partly bc unvaxxed bolder US maybe mostly mingle other? wild speculation true, would massively spike cases among unvaxxed. find horrible ongoing problem year now.

It's absolutely crews fault, affecting crew families, also global trade.

Someone needs light fire asses get things working again. someone explain numbers calculated?

Aside operating various equipment giving medicines patients, ICU nurses also take care patients‚Äô personal hygiene feed them.

""We carefully keep close track indicators order alert doctors immediately anything abnormal. Patients constant dialysis heart rate blood pressure change easily,"" said Phuong, another ICU nurse.

Doctor Linh checks patient order decide course action situation gets worse better.

How many people posted social media loved one severely effected Covid? Probably whole lot say get vaccine complication   one making claim zero evidence, even references ""many immunologists"" could colouring applied faded .... Also Google mehandi .... kinda temp colour India  went lot some. mean bacteria btw? that, idk Apple anything vaccine passport. paradox people seem taking covid delta variant seriously people fully vaccinated, fully vaccinated people genuinely worry anymore documented severe cases non-elderly non-immunocompromised fully vaccinated person.  Ha state doesn‚Äôt even post new cases one weekends anymore.  UK 45%/45%/10% AZ/Pfizer/Moderna.

The data shows decernable different data AZ/Pfizer.

So nah, that's it.

Probably testing. UK plenty friends get tested 5 times week various reasons. middle century pandemic, think much ask even vaccinated people keep wearing masks - especially data countries (that US) suggesting vaccinated people spreading Delta variant degree. 

We taking precious restaurants vacation outings away. asking damn mask. 

The tone discussing immunocompromised people/kids always ""sucks you.....buuuut...too bad (p.s. really care situation all)."" asking much.  know people truly vaccinated? Interesting data. also idiots large followings Efficacy infection function level exposure accounted either measure. anecdotal, wife parents breakthrough cases recently. felt like bad cold they're mostly better. even gotten tested except mom lost sense taste.    CCP shown opague uncooperative basic level comes investigating covid origins. destroyed/hid evidence unresponsive, outright antagonistic, attempts international community investigate WIV.

Yes esteemable, good-faith scientists research China government real problem. 

We responsibility end collaboration unaccountable, censorious authoritarian regimes.  Guillan Barre also likely come autoimmune response illness opposed vaccine.  Nobody wants vaccine anymore, politicians already talked possible lockdown.

And rest Europe almost certainly follow. Even uptake increased, still end lockdown ultimately even matter. Can't believe people surprised uptake decreased pretty obvious nothing change better.  would concerned proving vaccine date birth card doesn‚Äôt match actual dob.

Scottish people likely say 'jag' 'jab'. injections called UK. can't reason people position reason into. 

We however, keep requiring vaccines businesses, schools, military service etc. 

Most people can't afford lose job home school kid. unprecedented rise Delta variant 1000 times present infected people, compared COVID base. Kubrick secretly Jew duh! vaccinated won‚Äôt comply. Sorry  Got it! Thank you!  really hypocritical sounds.

The core belief modern conservatism corporations free please. private corporation deciding require employees vaccinated come office completely different government deciding going restaurant, even though effect similar.

As happens restrictions cold weather: knows. isn‚Äôt true Israel got Delta first. Also Australia, past record success, difficulties getting virus control (to zero) seems less likely still happening. know several people caught vaccinated guess know months OP article says Good commissioner  data seriously puzzling.

You'd think would transparent arrived conclusions now; haven't. Also puzzling almost always politicians making claims public health. 

More studies coming showing Delta legitimate concern unvaccinated, I'm really starting lean toward substantial flaws Israel's methodology. think Canada best real-world example expect; Delta running rampant provinces like Ontario, yet every day report slightly lower case count day before; hospitalizations increasing either. virus may able without losing advantage. hospitalisations/deaths followed. less vulnerable people vaccinated. agree. think insurance companies probably going charge higher premiums unvaxxed eventually. going cost lot. Page exist. interesting point! I‚Äôm going hope explains it.  mean... really surprised this? 10 million people die yearly cancer, one really gives damn.

According local health authorities 8 hours around 80000 appointments set.

The population range around 260000 people 19000 already vaccinated due work (teachers, health worker...). means around 1/3 took appointment first day option Half point requiring universal masking (behind breakthrough) give lying vaccine status exemption hide in.

When store managers local authorities board, universal compliance actually achievable - hardly ever saw anyone unmasked store last year.

But self identified masking? Nope, that's going work except adherents. I'm vaccinated smaller site Netherlands describe. imagine bit efficient way (until idiots gonna idiot course).

Fingers crossed country (Ireland) beats it. like taking kid school free consequences. Lambda Lamda Lambda Ah ok. hope makes quick recovery. appreciate reply also still questions really similar person replying to.

With UK reporting 50-60k infections DAILY right now, suppose is? actually presenting testing diagnosed COVID-positive? assume vast majority fully vaccinated, vast majority UK fully vaccinated.

If majority people UK's daily case count right vaccinated, know/are classifying cases according vaccine received? I.E. Pfizer vs. AZ, mRNA vs. adenovirus?

Are hospitals also getting overrun again?

Thanks. It‚Äôs original vaccines. There‚Äôs various arms study, get dose, get less.  lot health problems muddying waters takes vast amounts data find correlations research find causations. study seem account variants specifically. delta spreads interesting see impact. one prove vaccinated? certainly cleared couple days lmao. people wait far longer risk might asymptomatic.

Also, way Olympics tries risk everything letting someone tested positive days prior compete. kinda like Japan Dejima Tokugawa era?  Scotts stupid free shot. valid way look it.

The 933 breakthrough cases people severe enough symptoms wonder infected get tested, people serious medical conditions getting tested every time clear throat.

Most breakthroughs extremely mild never counted. don‚Äôt think thats accurate all. stories refuting numbers. Mexico's excess deaths since beginning pandemic, see country like India 10x population least 5x deaths. [No, literally fact, transmissibility experiments performed _at variant_. Correct. patients get zero care already. Point still stands.  It‚Äôs sub right entire issue revolves around low vaccination rate Japan. yes worried. Bringing back mask mandates punishment completely misplaced self-own. happen vaccinated population put back actual group causing problem, unvaccinated ones, going to.

Nobody running around unvaccinated right suddenly decide ""Welp guys time put mask back LOL"" - grounded reality, period.

You're punishing people everything right. Thank part help us all. Fox News news? Exactly.

Israel extreme outlier vaccine efficacy studies I'm starting think kind major structural flaw research. could understand *some* reduction efficacy, way I'd realistically expect.

We know UK Canada vaccine efficacy 80% **infection tout court** Delta also know studies world vaccine-induced immunity, like infection-induced immunity, persists long time (6 months *at least*, likely far longer, general consensus guess).

And Israel telling us Pfizer completely shit vaccine barely lasts 4 months, less normal flu vaccine (and flu mutates far far quickly covid). goes basically know vaccines covid. perfect virus immediately escapes vaccine nearly 100% protective. Something seriously adding here. I'm shitty mid-size tech company CEO (a wee little man Napolean complex) wants everyone partially November technically teams decide.

I got new job offer much bigger company also wants go back November feels strict back-to-office plan.

Unsure take offer hope best regarding lockdowns. I'm SF city US re-locks first it'll probably us. Cries American asked question, supposed say never bring back mask mandates?, course proper answer will. gotcha question, way someone put headline saying Governor considering mask mandates awesome. bit upsetting needs done state level given CDC's decision track extremely important data. seeing this? So, takeaway get 
1. vaccines effective 
 
2. Anti-vaxxers look breakthrough numbers conclude vaccines worthless. 

In words, they'll see want see. Familiarity breeds contempt give vaccination card injection, they'd need another queue another whole row staffed desks (or could considerably fewer vaccinations per day staff level).

Banks already started going back office (at least JPMC people office since June, depending location). Yes, soon resurrections unlocked.  makes want scream. going get vaccinated! matter say them, matter incentives/penalties are, matter long vaccines studied, matter many friends die, simply happening many, many people. put gun head told take shot, many would tell pull trigger rather submit. China? aren‚Äôt long term lockdowns since mid 2020. Probably know much kind thing years.  You‚Äôre allowed charge interest religion members. Banking doesn‚Äôt sustain without charging interest. Christians go Jews vice versa. Christianity spread, balance skewed. Sen Paul lying lips moving. Ultimately delta would hit point. I'm sure federal government could done anything short completely stopping international travel closing borders military.

Israel UK shown us high vaccination rates lead reductions delta cases point restrictions required. NI always conservative there's probably anti-vaxxers there.

I also think government bit disappointed overall uptake England, particularly amongst younger people probably major part reasoning behind choice require covid passes nightclubs. US case numbers much worse said US less tests per capita Malaysia nearly Indonesia there's almost complete correlation cases hospitalizations suggesting unlike UK there's almost tracing community spread. also protects vaccinated individuals. unvaccinated get infected, higher chances unfavorable mutation. guy's post would mean patients would get zero care. Yes less likely. Best source information French Speaking audience. Lots hard data thinking too.... mean got really sick would certainly get tested, symptoms like sniffles, sore throat, etc- probably wouldn't. course, ability work home helps, office would probably get tested regardless.

""Covid variants"" thing. There's variant disease, variants virus. ""SARS-CoV-2 variants"".

It's ""Covid-19 vaccine"", ""SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"", Google gives number results both, reputable organizations use both. could argued ways, (right?) vaccines named disease rather virus. prefer ""Covid vaccine"". 

""The Pfizer"", ""The J&amp;J"", etc., bother me, ""The Pfizer vaccine"" doesn't. ""Pfizer"" ""Moderna"" alone pretty clear. 

And we're topic, ""Pfizer"", following: Pfyzer, Phizer, Pfiser, Phiser. I've seen four used threads.

Creston? watched video recently speculated saw whole thing play press (including Wakefield's fall disgrace struck off), saw end story well, part revealed scam. countries heard said and, citizen, hear much downfall work discredited. Thus people UK come back around vaccines greater numbers elsewhere. seems plausible me. statistics show deaths reported since previous day, that's thing deaths *occurred* since previous day. effect significant. 

If look daily deaths, see pretty clear wave, lowest weekends highest mid-week.

If tried compare deaths christmas per-day basis, example, results would depend heavily whether christmas break fell weekend year not. 

The cases data thing. 5 days high, 2 days much lower. july 5 broke trend; super low monday, likely many americans day off.

I'm far international law expert, understanding countries waive immunity consent suit. There's underlying contract here. would presume Japan waive immunity. trying help gains Hey! None reasonable math. here! Comeon angry scared mad us! children actually get vaccine lifting restrictions. Regardless correction, kind stats always fail provide context many vaxxed population. Can't make inference without that. way, would closer 0.5% 1% world‚Äôs population, still massive horrifying number. Um, uninfected people? vaccines helps with? Maybe? mind explain little since article say much? many people talking about, risk group? who's part 40%? ""See? told vaccines work!""

* Anti-vaxxer dying Omega variant say based exactly? country this? Absolutely true. RN pretty decent one that. I‚Äôve always loved geriatric care - applied work nursing home. Offered 20 hour (ridiculously low), 3 days orientation, care 20+ patients time.

And that‚Äôs better lot places‚Ä¶ Show data proves it. we're middle pandemic obvious statistics gyms breeding ground right? work common sense?  information.

You whatever personality following pulled your/their rear end.

And even informed enough tell clever lie. 31 deaths 5 million vaccinated 1% chance dying Well important part ""and then"" completely skipped Vaccines aren‚Äôt equally distributed. Los Angeles incredibly racially segregated despite supposed progressivism, many it‚Äôs racial communities low vaccination rate. It‚Äôs spreading there.

A bet many people Manhattan Beach, West Hollywood, Santa Monica got Covid last week. TL, DR ""It theoretically possible, experts say, occur. doctors treating Covid-19 patients across country contend appear significant risk."" 335 deaths world mask mandates largely place children school online. 

I wonder numbers look like fall schools open. AAP recommended masks schools children 2 up, knows going guidance everyone follows... 2020 talk wanted 60-70% vaccinated everything would fine  Thanks! Don‚Äôt feel bad physically, missing important family events. Don‚Äôt want kill mom. 

Thanks anti-vaxers keeping virus around! Let‚Äôs bring back polio next! /s Doubtful. mandatory flu vaccines coworkers mine still get doctors notes get every year. Nothing would happen gave patient flu. 

If could even prove one investigate whether people go clubbing hookup? equal immunity, described immunity? What? delta transmissible is, two options: Get vaccinated, get Covid. You‚Äôre FAR likely die complications covid vaccine. Seems like easy choice me. Maybe visit England. vaccine grants 95% chance getting hospitalized covid, aka serious. Kids totally LEAST ones getting hospitalized. That's they're getting vaccinated first first place. Mutations thing maybe, Delta variant aka ""D Delta 4th"" still covered current vaccines, meaning mutating enough. lastly, goes back first point is, people vaccinated back normal. like dude please get along it, CARE die BELIEVE it. Yet vaccinated people SOOO worried them. Sorry, universal way works. protection vaccinated selves children, even want write refusers. Get high horse. achieve want, zero covid, life would stop indefinitely. thank you. Help understand this. Covid poses almost risk anyone 15. So, rationale seems protect unvaccinated, point choice many people taking. instead trying requiring adults vaccine rates, going take kids? I'm going need popcorn IV lot flu infections asymptomatic. yes common occurrence  name delta variant Covid-21? athlete, Kara Eaker, vaccinated. ""Your performance par"" data bit old anyways, Japan currently 33% total population vaccinated least 1 dose 21% fully vaccinated. course, Japan instead started vaccinating couple months earlier did, vaccination rates would probably 50% least 1 shot. would similar US is, terms overall population. county 62.7% fully vaccinated 81% adults least 1 dose, yet 2.4% positivity rate yesterday, one highest state. makes sense. I'm living nightmare now. father likely die tomorrow. mother scoffing everything covid point. went hospital 1 week ago today, (probably 4-5 days later have) insisted mother get vaccinated. tested negative, got 1st shot, 3 days later sick fuck.

They're Florida, though tell, I'm 14 hours away. though I'm fully vaccinated know resistant variant done them, can't risk family come offer support help. I'm constantly fighting urge yell, ""I told trust science, NOOOO, trusted Donald fucking Trump!! Goddammit!""

 Daily hospitalizations: 7,328



[Current Hospitalizations \(07/19\): 528](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/data/index.htm) fucking stupid person wrote headline? 

UNKNOWN ?!?! KIDDING US ?!?!? one said would rise level previous waves. rise, levels still kill 100s people per day almost entirely avoidable. Deaths already 7 day average 41, bottom 6 2 months ago. Even cases peak today, deaths rising ~150 per day middle August already baked in. Again, nowhere near 1st 2nd waves, rise levels significantly even worst flu seasons. Depending are, able according laws 3985 Louisiana period. definitely said someone never worked healthcare. We‚Äôre already understaffed daily testing Trump‚Äôs White House still got it. attended show QR code demonstrated vaccinated, recently Covid infection negative Covid test.

Curious QR code came from. Almost nobody know early 20s vaccinated doubt isn‚Äôt consistent festival population. imagine people get QR code people get MDMA from. ...but UK 95% fully vaccinated. waaay lower that. would make sense consider ‚Äúwillful refusal vaccination‚Äù factor deciding receives lung transplants point mean vaccinated still get infected. Well they're open am, no. That's mean, people saying dude, CARE stupid vaccine, people saying DIE NEED SAVE YOU, people CARE. Uh hello? going clubbing? disagree. really know vaccine status athletes. guess lot get vaccinated makes sense. hesitancy mess training real issue level.  Yes is. lot nurses refusing. Strange know Anybody knows average/expected incubation time developing Covid symptoms least 1 dose?

I read Delta variant 4 days incubation time unvaccinated individuals, opposed 5‚Äì7 days previous variants. what's actually vaccinated?

My throat bit sore 10-11 days theoretical exposure (went doctor's office, FFP3, patient far tested positive doctor), maybe I'm anxiety. get 2nd dose week (5 weeks first). make sense rapid test vaccinated? less accurate possible lower viral charge? absolutely mandatory healthcare workers students, like every major vaccination.

Instead, we're going normalize Americans suffering yet another preventable problem. God forbid ""cancel"" ""censor"" people actively harming others. you‚Äôre vaccinated US eligible basically fact antivax crusade deserve get  deadly infectious. hospitals filling millions unvaccinated people cocky wearing mask   disagree - although every feels sick shots. point lifetime event athletes worked years get point. People hesitant, point superstition, anything might jeopardize training way.

I competed world championship level people bring suitcases food avoid eating \*anything\* 100% familiar them. want put \*bottled water\* bodies might used to. quite obsessive.

I happen think required vaccines Olympic committee could insured available athletes 3-4 months ago. Despite collection agency might say debt pass loved ones person dies. 

So case person pay anything. point. Brain damage brain disorders? believe I'm looking [the right now. course unfortunate side affects largest categories study far ""Mood, anxiety, psychotic disorder"", representing 24% participants, ""Substance use disorder"" ""Insomnia"" following behind respectively, compared 34% participants negative outcome. who've hospitalisation particular largely reporting three side affects listed above. what‚Äôs calculation knowing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs actually 40% (or less)? general, reinfection means person infected (got sick) once, recovered, later became infected again.

From liked page

Notice (got sick) infected? That's defining \`infected\` 


They choose repeat second 63 reinfected, 2 died. 


Sounds like big. 3% chance death, oh wells. 1 31.5 terrible right? That's only.... 10 million 315 million US population. 40% immunosuppressed, 71% hypertensive, 48% diabetic Yes, disinformation FB, Twitter social media platforms dangerous. companies take action remove ban users post shit. That's true too... probably ICU staff witnessed death death, seen elderly nursing home patients could rationalize different themselves.

Parts health care system basically business worst it, usefully repurposed. think Great Aunt Arlene's ignorance defense? Also, assume attempting persuade others? entire point posting anything social media inform others. Oh, country pretty normal (but then, Florida, Ron DeSantis power censor case numbers probably would). explanations able stay normal always make go, ""that's it?"" reaction Taiwan, Vietnam pre-Delta, even South Korea, Zero-COVID policy never lost control. concluded must kind regional factor understand makes outbreaks easier get control.

To get back subject, one thing China done right unlike zero-COVID countries, they've made sure get lot people vaccinated try combat kind vaccine hesitancy saw lot countries low spread. amount vaccination enough herd immunity, least make zero-tolerance policy sustainable face new variants. feel like that's main issue here. me, seems like debate believe variants eventually defeat vaccines versus believe efficacy mRNA vaccines remain high. former want restrictions come back, latter want restrictions come back clear vaccines longer work. waste healthy organs could gone someone brain doesn‚Äôt also require transplanting. even says second link ""my musings inferential"". one say sure whether risk vaccine escape variants exists, risk increased single dosing vaccinating half many people.  become Olympic athlete without making important choices health? Based quality I've seen come mouth already, I'm going go ahead care say me. I'm sure comes much thought spent covid -- zero -- that's opinion worth. Probably nothing, return Less worried what? You‚Äôre avoiding said kids *spreading* virus adults. Kids die have‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs rare. mean, there‚Äôs point even hypothesize. We‚Äôre going go back adult life. We‚Äôll see work full swing kids back school verdict communities. wait. day before? hotel lined up, I'd rather know good cancellation window. vaccinated CDC cards still, it'd good able confirm ahead time. FFS, careful vaccinated resumed many activities. travel yet, dining indoors sharing respiratory droplets fairly confidently fully vaccinated protected. I'm really trying analyze latest data, damn getting husband's buy-in social distancing going like putting toothpaste back tube. think falls ""those cases"". Honestly, great fully-vaccinated person well. feel 0 sympathy chose get vaccinated miss out. people say ‚ÄúyOu sTiLl gEt CoViD‚Äù let‚Äôs real here. Multiple people US team including Coco caught Covid I‚Äôm sure chosen get vaccinated.

Edit: see vaccinated. seems Coco however not. unvaccinated, yes. vaccinated (lest immunocompromised) fine. think fretting though. what's comfortable you. means masking everywhere staying home time, go it.  I've done like 5 times today Hahaha therapeutic Western countries fucked up, everybody. would believe one country one else world possible exception New Zealand? make sense me. 

I sometimes nightmares maybe China's exceptional status due something nefarious. would stupid thing believe, see ""only China right policy"" making sense ""only China antidote.""

Your question ""how think virus would spread"" sort answered ""food delivered."" Even hardest lockdowns, many people working virus able spread certain extent. outbreaks produce tiny handful cases, believe China zero-tolerance policy, spread even lockdown. 

I'm glad able live mostly normal way, see possible one country exception entire world. think fair say one million vs one thousand (as said) varies wildly depending age condition. I'm guessing 'one thousand' apply people higher risk, correct?

We also know long term effects vaccine either though. Let introduce Florida Man They're willing sacrifice public safety preservation freedoms People think like brick wall. virus still gets in, body able get rid spreads enough transmit show symptoms We're already seeing side effects vaccines kids ie myocarditis. wait needed proceeding. Esp kids least impacted covid. emphasis adults. Yes, anyone leadership position actually values people political careers stock markets already adopted measures successful covid. reality US failed state. risk vaccine negligible compared risk COVID. math you. ignore math, people everyday, make right. ok go gym got Covid recently? got infected even vaccine good feeling might Delta Variant. I'm negative now, ok next months since antibodies right? point continual spread. takes continual non impacting spread hospitalize kill does. Every one small part chain infection kills next person. behavior many problem. spread unvaccinated roommate, really covid? anything remotely like winter measure come back. Capacity limits may imposed won‚Äôt followed strictly vaccinated isolating vaccinated friends family still personal gatherings home anything shut down.

It‚Äôs going happen barring sort jarring new evidence agreed experts vaccines literally offer protection. Fire replace sane people. Please stay healthy Simone Biles! else think could creating it? Regardless, good anecdotes. Hopefully solid data soon enough. spread less, basically get impacted compared many dangers exposed to, think less worried. People need understand vaccines equal immunity. may well get covid vaccinated symptoms lessened odds hospitalization death substantially lower. know coming - also bit worried vaccines initially. rare extreme reaction MMR vaccination younger. bad. However, reasoned known risks catching Covid far, far greater potential unknown risks new vaccine. I've vaccinations now, I'm totally fine. worried, means go doctor concerns. Maybe could get shots office, supervision. Please let fears limit future. rate we're going watching mario sonic Olympics Twitch. Masks you‚Äôre indoors, there‚Äôs probably air conditioning. agree, pipe dream. next year going nightmare... again.  want faint even climbing stairs, please get vaccine health. fact death rate low age either mean gonna die suffer ways it. 

Yes, vaccinated individuals sometimes become positive. especially young, get pneumonia faint, recover mostly common cold. ICU stats many countries well prove (under 40s unvaccinated end ICU 40s practically never do) They‚Äôve nearly 100,000 isn‚Äôt means, numbers underreported early still seems like country pretty normal. say ‚Äúno one could be‚Äù look NZ, Taiwan VN (up delta month ago) curious, symptoms really bad, barely enough felt like get tested? others pointed out, Kara Eaker, athlete tested positive, fully vaccinated. roommate, Leanne Wong (who quarantining), get vaccine specifically parents worried would affect training would miss time gym. mother said worried COVID ""how careful health.""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Alright agree that. Although rare individual would subject high viral dose real life, amount protection would diminish viral dose increases. wonder there's ideal condition vaccine scientists aim Phase 3 trials. Like done somewhere sufficient number cases get enough data, maybe somewhere completely overwhelmed. Sounds like character CEOs mid size tech companies Already New Jersey believe. Free admission state parks incentives well known WTF read article even tiny anyone's head. They're real,"" said Dr. Bruce Patterson, CEO founder IncellDx San Carlos. ""They're due real immunological abnormalities, ways treating them.""  love Dr. Fauci goes Tony F mode  Although unfortunate 90% worried family vaccinated get boosters 

The virus ripping much world vaccinated it‚Äôs going happen anyway bound possible mutations maybe evade vaccine better doubt get much contagious virulent 

Can worry much. Also anti-vaxers ambivalent aren‚Äôt going listen it‚Äôs wasted breath many months allowed discuss reality. Politics played integral role pandemic handled, public told, public asked react respond, simply blanket-banned discussing somehow political figures contradicting science causing pandemic worsen nothing pandemic. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Dumb people don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre dumb I‚Äôm terrified September. I‚Äôm going get dragged back work; I‚Äôve wfh 10 months. let happen already. poor, poor individual. Life must impossibly hard you. Rest easy. wouldn‚Äôt want wear mask kid school.  would feelings hurt agreeing me? Calling liers stupid nothing, needs consequences lying incompetent. long consequences nothing change. Unfortunately people power impose consequences Rand constituents leadership party. Neither cares. I'll wait FDA approval per standards set scientists :) 

It's aggressive hurts feelings.  No. might even deadly unvaccinated higher viral loads. Since pre-symptomatic spread low death rate billions potential hosts, almost selective pressure become less deadly. ever become less deadly probably due random mutation.  That's true. state (Maine) 78%, New England region highly vaccinated. think Applebee‚Äôs great food, able taste isn‚Äôt big deal‚Ä¶ there's certain country made COVID political issue. wrong are, part story. said made seem like did, that‚Äôs came across would argue vaccinated people symptomatic would first tested. They‚Äôre obviously worried. non expert thought could vaccine really really really good stopping symptomatic covid  Scott Gottlieb mentioned still 25% population vulnerable meaning haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine infected. thinks pass wave better spot lot immunity.

One interviews last weekend. Sadly, long reservoir virus keep spreading evolving, likely get worse.

I'm still wearing mask fully-vaxxed. decided love masks- saves fortune make-up , longer wear 3 layered varieties offer SERIOUS protection- wear neoprene ones, awesome. 

I can't get sick. Even really bad cold...I can't afford point.  correlates pretty much directly education.

not stupid people degrees.... Yes, wait because. Exactly said. love keep aggressively agreeing me. Agreed, people forget NJ elects republican governors time time. don‚Äôt think Murphy trouble November republicans running absolutely suck, still don‚Äôt think wants go direction. don‚Äôt understand need masks again? got vaccine. problem people got vaccine dolts didn‚Äôt get vaccine? 

I know it‚Äôs complicated don‚Äôt get vaccine, go hospital / die..... I‚Äôm really sorry don‚Äôt feel bad you. That's point. Compare level US testing advanced economies, namely UK, higher rate vaccinations. US really concerned travel United Kingdom maybe government/CDC start testing/tracing somewhere near level, especially considering massive regional discrepancies within country (deep south dangerous situation due poor vaccination No, I'll wait approval that's FDA approval process for. okay mandated vaccines without FDA approval. exactly said first response. Lol.  schools open 0% students vaccinated. really simple. Scotland schools closed, cases plummeting. Lol. possible something make things look worse may (either purpose maybe accidental side effect purposefully leaving mess)? sure downvoted. Many vaxxed people getting continue catch covid. Granted symptoms likely less severe, planning ""getting back normal"" cases high, likely get covid, whether vaccinated not. Sure, that's understandable, know myocarditis bad enough cause problem, right? Given widespread distrust vaccines among general public well distrust media (on sides), anybody point good resources help alleviate fears vaccines? Specifically medical safety like. true tinfoil hatters won‚Äôt swayed I‚Äôd like help colleagues becoming stressed pending vaccine mandates within industry company.

I read faqs great along cited sources seem eschew detailed safety reinforcement concentration efficacy. PART 2

 
Let's put positive case numbers context vaccines. made assumption reply me, people vaccinated. I'm guessing made assumption based news hit 90% folks getting 1st dose. Ok, well let's look data see vaccines. top go vaccinations tab. see top 89.3% people 1 dose, 67.3% 2 doses. page see % coverage age group Scotland. Look categories 50 years age. know info MSUT vaccines real chance getting sick. age groups 50 lagging 2nd doses (because started oldest worked way down).  Specifically, add % people still needing first dose still needing second dose age groups know testing positive, pretty clearly see people vaccinated yet, definitely fully vaccinated yet.  
What tell us?  Well make educated guesses here. know people 25-44 testing positive most. I'd say, likely vaccinated , fully vaccinated. also see 45-64 age group also high positive testing rates largely fully vaccinated. Based know delta variant believe likely breakthrough infections seeing know Delta variant capable of.  
Why age groups testing positive more? Well stretch wonder look news, pubs, football matches, speculation none less younger people likely partying enjoying life lockdown. also travelling 45-64s summer holidays etc... 2 groups social interactions travel thus putting higher risk less protected context difficult variant control.  
Ok what? know vaccinated people still spread virus. know every time someone spreads increase chances mutation overcome vaccines treatments even continue become infective pathogenic. good.  
My understanding previous looks UK whole data similar Scotland, England NI behind Scotland even problematic age groups. entire world furious UK, specifically Boris, whole Freedom bullshit. wait grand opening weeks could ensured sacrifices made would protected. pretty big gamble make people's lives.  
Additionally, break infections still continue deaths Covid. I'm sorry, disagree notion accept deaths.  stay locked alone last year see bunch fucking people die.  note trends demographic tab deaths still largely older people. really sad, especially people dying younger age groups close getting vaccinated.  
  
Can hospitals still get overwhelmed? Yes. 23 Intensive Care Units 41 High Dependency Units Scotland. 173 ICU beds total pandemic, additional 585 ventilators (this mean, room, staff, oxygen supply)  exceeded baseline capacity March April.  47 covid patients Scotland yesterday 159 hospital. virus mutates similar way Delta variant anywhere else world could see number go sky high again. unlikely continue aggressive vaccinations restrictions, particularly travel place.   
Scottish Healthcare Audits | Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) | Critical Care | Health Topics | ISD Scotland  
As always, think critically said data I've presented. forget scientist. Look things skeptically presented appropriate level quality evidence, change mind. want critically appraise papers find tools help CASP.  also SIGN.  
And all...keep questioning everything!!!!!  
Hope helps understand. people specifically specialize virology infectious disease, please feel free correct chime in. Input discourse always appreciated. :) conflating inherent characteristics (race, sexuality, gender, familial origin) chosen characteristics (political affiliation, religion, online messageboard activity). also issue inconsequential Covid many people. know probably ~40 people Covid, two hospitalized none died suffering long term effects. know compared cold.

I'm way downplaying severity, think many people disconnect seeing many recover ease, witnessing extreme case people hospitalized die. PART 1

Hi, I'll best answer questions point information. I'm based Scotland familiar data here, answer best can. Please remember papers preprint. means passed peer review process completely. ones posting findings generally supported scientific knowledge peer reviewed feel stretch relatively safe consider. 50-60k infections UK per day?

The current variant prevalent UK infections Delta variant. variant mutations make significantly easier spread, even wearing masks. much higher affinity cell receptors bind much easily replicate quickly. means smaller exposure necessary catch higher viral loads sick people means get sicker also likely pass (larger viral load = chances spread another person) scientific paper discusses mutations. preprint means yet finished peer review process. also looked virus lab animals humans, however still applies gives us idea human testing. also supports already know see Delta variant.

See: SARS-CoV-2 spike P681R mutation, hallmark Delta variant, enhances viral fusogenicity pathogenicity | bioRxiv virus easier catch replicates more. studies also indicate ability evade immunity (from vaccines ill).

See: Mutation-induced Changes Receptor-binding Interface SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant B.1.617.2 Implications Immune Evasion | well variant easier catch, replicates more, makes people sick, also evade immune system effectively. lets look current context. Strict lockdown measures ensuring social distancing masks disappeared. England even requiring masks trains places literally enclosed tight space others. Sporting events mass people enclosed tight spaces already happening too. Even outdoors put enough people close together catch it. Especially singing shouting. preprint article suggests singing shouting cause virons emitted thus passed on.

See: Viral Load SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Aerosols Emitted COVID-19 Patients Breathing, Talking, Singing | man. That's good. virus easier catch rest PLUS making easier virus (which already evading social distancing masking measures) infect others relaxing protections. What's even worse people pass virus quite easily without ever symptoms, non-descript symptoms. sequence events major part many cases.  put mildly, we've put cart horse relaxing restrictions without 100% close vaccinated rate.

But there's more.... Delta variant escape natural immunity well vaccine induced immunity. numerous reports world supporting paper listed above. matter fact, someone know got double vaccinated. get vaccinated, spread too. (see info posted original comment) vaccine protection virus/spreading it. protection dying.

&amp;#x200B;

It difficult give nice sweeping round rosy numbers everyone wants vaccine effectiveness. nuanced highly dependent definitions illness, etc... According UK gov vaccine surveillance page 6: alpha variant (not infective pathogenic current delta) pretty high confidence AZ vaccine protected symptomatic illness 55-70% time single dose. Well Delta variant turned head reasons above. page 7 see new figures starting come together Delta. 14% absolute reduction vaccine effectiveness 1 dose. means 1 dose AZ vaccine protect symptomatic illness less half time half time! That's largely threshold consider therapeutic drug. However, absolute risk 10% less dose number

&amp;#x200B;

This means 2 doses offers significantly better protection symptomatic illness Delta. effectiveness drops 55-70% 40-60%. issue rookie numbers disease getting easier transmit making people sicker!  Pfizer slightly better according numbers report though. Remember though, symptomatic infection. still pretty well hospitalizations deaths.

COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report - week 28 (publishing.service.gov.uk)I believe combination factors causing high case load, need address questions answer well. need understand testing positive, getting sick, vaccinated doses 1 2.

The current testing figures Scotland are:  COVID-19 Daily Dashboard | Tableau Public trends demographics see following: week 12 July- right hand chart bars going lists cases sex age group. clearly see vast majority positive cases 25 44 year old group. Males Females close, slightly males females. next highest group list 45 64 males females nearly even. switch drop menu view negative cases reported see 2 age groups also highest reporting negative tests. tells us answer question, getting tested? 25-44 45-64 highest 2 group rates testing negative test results positive test results.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 posted reply post percentage still remarkably high. 5.5% new cases fully vaccinated means vaccine used terribly effective twice effective partially vaccinated folks. Still great results. /s bidets great! Highly suggest getting one. hope medical training paying üòâ Folks crazy honestly think go work. job home, trust likely throw bs come excuses work home like children don‚Äôt want expose etc etc.

i work utility super backwards new team leader said come 2-3 days week want come 0 days want. work home don‚Äôt take advantage it. sure companies wouldn‚Äôt follow suit type guideline everything home without office. State mandate vaccines school-aged children full approval. Federal government cannot.

States retain right curtail rights reasons safety public health. Federal Government cannot.  It'd interesting see comparison American major city vax rates vs rural vax rates.  going full base rate errors, still useful. Vaccinated people without symptoms aren‚Äôt getting tested, it‚Äôs good see prevalent among unvaccinated. many states (27 think?) localities collecting data. aren‚Äôt data vacuum. Also, think CDC may forced change position. Congrats everyone! got second dose yesterday feel like shat today. Glad fully vaxxed though :)

Edit: thought r/Canada. Sorry!! saw couldn‚Äôt roll eyes hard enough. Anti vax crazies tend get pretty stirred scientific data nut job. Look graph, 3 parts similar steepness within 1.5 years. Hardly unprecedented article talks delta ""Recommended"" taken ""Yes, come without mask.""  Right, stated reason. wait approval sake it. exactly said first response. Lol. also slowed considerably. need boosters. talk functional illiteracy, still 1-2% really can't read. (well, might higher US since [4.2% people taking 2013 PIAAC test refused answer literacy I'm guessing one reasons discussed more, US average far behind OECD average. fact US average significantly ahead average France, Spain Italy (and ex aequo Germany).

Maybe it'll get lot worse, maybe won't.

[most recent remember big push recently portion recently received vaccine dose (first second)

Delta different beast entirely, expect infections rise rapidly light opening yesterday. Shit said 2 doses hit clubs people started injecting like heron addicts bridge. May RIP agree sentiment, hard people identify truth. think name calling make easier - think demand sources effing research, lies easier spot struggling find better answers. Meanwhile USA..... We've got stop pushing people. never going get vaccinated, matter anyone said, never will. that's choice free make, whether like not. We've done them. Time leave alone. don't, going violence. guarantee people right planning mass shootings vaccination clinics pushed far enough. Yeah, understand part, fact happens months end comparable viruses? say that? Isn‚Äôt secondary microbial infection rare covid patients ? No. People find jobs schools. one goes jail vaccinated. can‚Äôt engage world rest us spreading disease well dying themselves.

It‚Äôs insane people required take vaccine help others. selfish people be? aggressively proud selfish? article nothing quantify anything delta. Deaths since January doesn‚Äôt account delta. Vaccine effective delta MUCH less alpha wild type. 

A mRNA vaccinated person 20-34% risk unvaccinated person infection delta‚Ä¶ number 5% alpha. basic objection vaccine altogether serious one. ""experimental.""  FDA grants full approval, anti-vaxxers shift goal posts something else. one first states get brunt virus last June treatment, vaccine years away far knew, health experts still trying figure best course action was.

While there's doubt two points, people also forget high population density northeast NJ, close proximity NY. short jaunt bridge tunnel city makes prime real estate NY's workers. There's high likelihood many infected NY workers considered NJ cases due live. Also, lockdown, areas boom foot traffic hit pretty hard resource-wise. Couple large anti-mask movement Northeast got outbreak heaven. I'm getting vaccines around world people willing take that's separate matter constant fear-mongering hypothetical doomsday variants. You‚Äôre making seem like less effective aren‚Äôt effective not? Flanders (Dutch speaking Belgium), 89% adults gotten first shot already 63% fully vaccinated. We're getting despite slow start EU. I'm fully vaxxed already too. ~~[most recent replied wrong post Florida public health organization told call doctor, doctor told wait Friday see get 'real' symptoms. thing is, know much known yet vaccinated people symptoms get. wondering anyone experienced thing before.

üé∂ gonna get butt naked bangin bathroom floor üéµ US?

The UK Israel's experience similar places like Maryland, 100% hospitalized unvaccinated. Similar stats states.  thankfully see old people hospital like UK.

Could vaxxed? US far ahead UK... Thoughts? Take chances, bet it‚Äôs flu. Killed cousin, 21.

Plus Aunt almost wiped uncle. Plus took 14 friends family. Wish could warn more. fired refuse get vaccinated. Huh, good point.

Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre getting upvoted that. travel to? count cases, cross-reference vaccination status? Even vaccinated, think it‚Äôs great idea go back masks social distancing. It‚Äôs early tell effective vaccination be. good friend‚Äôs husband got Pfizer April he‚Äôs sick right now. Got lungs scanned last night ED it‚Äôs Covid pneumonia. Even breakthrough infections rough monitoring home. 

I work weekends hospital exploded Covid admissions floor. Luckily far unvaccinated exception one allegedly Johnson vaccine. She‚Äôs near intubation. Currently full bipap support confused. Every nurse work vacationing going business Covid isn‚Äôt thing months Look demographic. elephant room. I'm tired everyone willfully ignoring this. wonder anti-vaxxers view covid ""survival fittest"" hoping people view inferior die off. course, like short-sighted idiots self-awareness, anti-vaxxers assume they'll fine get covid nothing bad happen them, they're special like people. greatest mistake anyone make life looking something horrific like catching virus lead death permanent physical damage thinking ""that could never happen me."" always happen you. hate articles like this. Statistically, fine 24 year old even unvaccinated. looking edge cases, vaccine side effects? got Pfizer vaccine soon able (which back March me). I'm simply stating know COVID vaccine. guess really agree people try exaggerate dangers COVID and/or downplay risks vaccine. people vaccine hesitant stupid, they'll see right really convince anyone get vaccine telling likely think they'll end hospital compared shit sandwich vaccine is, getting covid shit cake dirahea frosting.

If asymptomatic (which lot people were), simply true. anecdotal, reading many threads fully vaccinated people caught COVID sub /r/COVID19Positive, seems people still develop lingering symptoms spite vaccination. 
 
I'd assume risk would less, since antibodies elicited vaccine help clear virus faster, people noted issues weeks acute infection post-vaccination. really making realize COVID going anyway anytime soon. We're going dealing years. mild flu pandemic officially now, case least 2023. complying. selflessness part. do? always people like leech rest us. Fucking parasites. Well, unvaccinated patients least start. I'm interested partially vaccinated individuals well discourse Well shit lot people received Pfizer, right? Even breakthrough rates, would people Pfizer breakthroughs. Look demographics. People want talk leading demographic refuses get vaccinated, historical prejudices... saying right now. believe delta variant came vaccinated people ‚Äúshedding‚Äù virus.

People know taught high school said trying contact trace case nightmare high school level. least elementary one group kids one room together quarantine class. mandated vaccine would make logistics lot easier. Maybe US set forth covid vaccination requirement incoming international travel now.

So technically, would major shift current policy. Nonetheless, interesting see turns out. covid vaccine helped mom's asthma resolve. ( ever covid) should‚Äôve allowed vaccines take effect two weeks first. heard let people even first dose earlier day. Singapore also advising receiving jab exercise 2 weeks after. problem vaccinated people spreading virus too.  lot states firing. absolutely feel comfortable getting vaccinated, least update beneficiaries. people Japan even opportunity vaccinated. Olympics global event. [This top science journal (Nature) cites meta-analysis showed that:

""asymptomatic individuals 42% less likely transmit virus symptomatic people.""

So asymptomatic spread seems less likely, *that* *much* less likely. Hangman may beg differ. vaccines probably failing delta variant. validity claims people making India using Ivermectin treat covid? Except daughters Even people still contact people (pretty much delivery drivers, supermarket workers, medical workers) would precautions eg always wear masks gloves, leaving food outside, mobile payments, tissues press elevator buttons etc. many infections start easy isolate it. one took many measures China did, seems like living denial Agreed wholeheartedly. recently tried submit op-ed touches upon say here: article popular whatsoever, bombarded downvotes deleted (presumably via mass reports) within 30 minutes. tried appeal repost sure allowed. 

 wish would less controversial topic talk maturely, there's much FUD media around (and amplified social media), much emotion involved extremely difficult try constructively talk right now, there's hivemind sorts work- point seems get considered 'its flu bro' bro expressing kind skepticism toward spectre long covid (e.g implied prevalence, possibility valid biological mechanism smaller subset people know post viral conditions entirely possible) correction poorly worded could believe intentional Ah would quite relief! Still 33% 3x higher month two ago hope God everyone stays safe giant superspreader could avoided. Certainly interesting, may correlation choice get vaccinated choice/opportunity frequent testing.

Also keep mind ""interesting"" policy move mild break cases officially tallied all, even seeing representative actual conditions rather selection bias, looking different statistic one officially counted. modern concept, rather purely cultural. 

The stereotypical African village (or pre-industrial tribe) struggled survival. Getting enough food survive winter dry season yearly challenge, bad weather could spell disaster end lives. Children resource-intensive, contribute immediate well-being tribe.

With modernity - lacking struggle survive - reason consider children expendable. good. scared stay box. ü§∑ viral load low show test, it‚Äôs also low infect another vaccinated person. Freely socialize vaccinated friends. Kills people claim they'll fight die country yet even wear tissue face holes 15 minutes walmart others. Infuriating Due shortages. Canada Pfizer shipments delayed, Moderna accelerated. This, combined Pfizer approved vaccine 12-17 age range, meant Moderna much available second doses many people.  worried. Got second rapid pcr negative. Scheduled pcr tomorrow afternoon doctor prescribed antibiotics cause thinks it‚Äôs probably covid given two negative rapid pcr. uh, delta leak here, give us minutes lock down. Uh large leak, dangerous. Very. serious condition unvaccinated, 37 fully vaccinated. 

**BUT**, huge BUT, one vaccinated 60. one exception among unvaccinated, 14 people age 50 serious condition, two younger 40. I'm disagreeing you, public opinion currently dictates nothing pandemic policy change get proof vaccines work. seen reductions efficacy, yes, point mRNA vaccines totally ineffective. set policy see point worrying get point. 

I think worrying things outside control bit unhealthy TBH. Trust me, wish things different too. politics dictates otherwise. Perhaps true smaller suburban areas. think it‚Äôs overstatement say ‚Äúa lot hospital workers‚Äù aren‚Äôt getting jabbed, especially us huge metro areas. us first line others followed us frankly scared fears alleviated saw fine. proudly display ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vaccinated‚Äù pin badge I‚Äôll proudly defend colleagues done same. Even ones weren‚Äôt got vaccine saw us it. politicians constituents want? them. U.S., U.K., Spain, Italy, never *hurts* get test. 10 days would well outside expected time frame. It‚Äôs much likely you‚Äôre experiencing seasonal allergies cold. Cold season got moved bit, definitely there. test positive Covid, wait symptoms subside getting second dose. it‚Äôs cold, ask doctor. don‚Äôt want vaccines you‚Äôre sick, immune system basically distracted active virus, may reschedule feel better. outdoor festival?  Well let's hope 20‚Äì40k *severe* happened pre-vaccinations rare disorder, covid potential bad. I'd felt pretty bulletproof getting fully vaccinated, I'm wondering situation scale back socializing. will, wish could assist classes remotely... moment make person... :/ mortality also pretty high back um

That definitely part it.

There also fact children consume resources contribute survival village. societies struggling survive, parents would go far kill children times hard take care them.

It seems greater value place children modernity regional culture. AAP believes that, point pandemic, given know low rates in-school transmission proper prevention measures used, together availability effective vaccines age 12 years up, benefits in-person school outweigh risks circumstances,"" guidance says.

The AAP says students wear masks school. experts disagree (including [those advising European None saying kids masked, send kids [online mockery instead. That's child neglect disguised concern public health. regional answer: many pandemics last decade originated China, China neighbors vigilant stamping epidemics. People Asia compliant wearing masks even coronavirus - air pollution terrible - reduces spread lot. pretty fascinating China sneezes, world catches cold China quick shake serious illness. Better hope another variant higher breakthrough rate healthy, younger, vaccinated individuals. letting unvaccinated remain so, setting perfect conditions that. Like idiom says bird hand better two bush.

We know covid kills. lot. know good amount cases long covid. know logic spending week hospital plugged machines fun.

But case MAYBE would long term effects vaccine well skip it?

Look, seem think taking vaccine like eating shit sandwich. dont agree, thats opinion. compared shit sandwich vaccine is, getting covid shit cake dirahea frosting. vaccinated? seems pretty crazy going on. guess add rare disorder elevates risk severe outcome caught covid. thanks well written reasonable response instead others rude telling get ASAP.  begun. though? I‚Äôll wear one already work, would say friends ‚Äúvaxxed going back group‚Äù mean, they‚Äôre right. data shows opening fine. need strong evidence otherwise sue.  hand society invested less children

Just carrying child around nine months ins serious investment mother, especially third trimester. Similarly, raising young child serious investment resources, time, energy. 

From utilitarian pint view, allowing investment killed maimed start 'paying off' poor choice. senior populations do. UK 2/3rd's adult population 2 doses. 

If 40% hospitalizations double-dosed, that's good would vaccine high 90%'s terms efficacy severe cases. didn‚Äôt describe immunity. Immunity means wouldn‚Äôt pop positive test ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Well, exactly. vaccine available 12-16 right Pfizer. teen Olympian (gymnast, swimmer‚Ä¶) allergy anything one wouldn‚Äôt eligible get vaccine. know Pfizer ‚Äúextra‚Äù stuff got mine- Moderna less filler stuff it, likely ingredients allergic reaction to.

There also diseases don‚Äôt necessarily effect athletic performance might flare immune response vaccines. autoimmune diseases don‚Äôt necessarily effect physical health unless active flare. Maybe different scenario, unfortunately personally know case covid infection (with original strain) got reinfected Delta British variant (dont know sure), bit ago trip southeast asia, exhibiting long covid symptoms 4 weeks getting better. didnt original covid infection.

Even worse, due covid infection, isnt allowed vaccinate. Outside mild overweight, underlying (known) medical conditions, female, early 30s.

I afraid indeed risk letting Delta burn population, vaccinated not, going see lot long covid. mention biggest problem long-haul covid affect children, cant get vaccine. I'm familiar Kubler-Ross model, I'm sure escape anger phase simple fact. poor mother deal sister (who kept, intentionally, dark) immediately, upon hearing critical, started sending nearly endless list doctors actually kill him, ask do. fucking nightmare. needs peace, bullshit. isn‚Äôt really helpful conversation. want promote vaccination. reason use various statistical tricks. example, Los Angeles county claims county hospitals filled unvaccinated patients, three county-run hospitals total. happening hospitals - nobody knows that. asked % vaccinated total number positive cases, claim hard trace. (Imagine hard ask one question testing person covid). Totally agree, seems CDC thinks plan makes much sense... 

As May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. shift help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health importance.  Good luck that! Let us know goes you. Good point. *Properly* key! Chin straps nose hangers cut it. üò£ Right, lags two weeks. math you. Submit article instead lamenting comments. Super sorry hear that. hope things much safer us vaccinated making progress. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre religious I‚Äôm praying counts anything! CDC ‚Äì Possible Side Effects Getting COVID-19 Vaccine ‚Äì Updated June 24, 2021:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* viruses get less deadly mutate. 

I think that's possible less deadly provides big enough competitive advantage spread virus.

SARS-COV-2 already quite good spreading given asymptomatic pre-symptomatic spread. cases fatal, there's still plenty time spread. layperson wtf know seems like may take years mutations get less harmful that's even possible given kind receptor targets.

Maybe think I'd assume will. Unknown anyone IQ &lt; 20 Well maybe someone love choking death covid different perspective. There's still work done. Least cover faces Wal-Mart 15 mins. Come one man. Olympics going lame year without crowd. even going opening ceremony? opening ceremony without crowd? Or, know, vaccinations     too, boy Asia going tough time Ok, two weeks ago UK 41% case peak occurred January two weeks later (today) they‚Äôre 9% hospitalization rate. Either way parse it, hospitalizations reduced least 75% current rate vaccinations UK. think real test whether eradicate covid fast escapes vaccines.

Influenza rapidly evolving significant number strains impact humans. stands cannot effectively vaccinate strains influenza. 

Covid still proven escape vaccines we're lucky there's still chance may able get covid controlled possibly eliminated. China unique combined political societal systems.
Is another country structures values? Maybe Vietnam comes close, also performed well recently.

Virtually one else responded exact way natural different results.

They much considered enemy nation got everybody board stamping completely.

Meanwhile here, debated weeks months long restrictions lockdown continued spread, enacting highest levels lockdown (still weaker China's) medical systems collapse.

Perhaps quite understand difference China's lockdowns ours. even put suspected infected people close contacts monitoring centers rather letting roam free continue chain infections. take chances containment, control within weeks stamped completely like 2 months.

From saw, even airport staff better equipped PPE medical staff here. even look recent vaccination drives, personnel fully equipped PPE suits staff vaccination location surgical masks on.

Nowadays whenever detect local transmission, mass testing levels envy everyone else. Literally tens millions tests within days.

Is expensive take precautions? Sort of, much less expensive letting run rampant like everyone else has. ‚ÄúBut long Covid!‚Äù

/s   remember days ‚Äúwhen vaccines available general public.‚Äù people moving ‚Äúwhen anti-vaxxers get vaccinations.‚Äù see leads conclusion. comparison Alpha Delta here. I'm aware. Point still stands Thanks Captain Obvious  It‚Äôs time live shit man. Like, wtf else point. Unless people faking negative tests vaccination status? Sounds like would good masks forever then. great point. outdoors + vax + n95, maybe dangerous i'm thinking I'd stop calling healthcare kills people saves. Glad wife got vaccines,as things becoming messy Japan.

Have safe trip! interesting see translates states high higher vaccination rates. wonder fourth location/comparison be. prepared wear one rest life? dealing covid rest lives.

People stopped wearing masks two years 1918 pandemic; influenza still exists hundred years later, humanity moved on.

It‚Äôs important remember viruses natural part biological life. vaccinated, covid poses even less health risk common flu. wasn‚Äôt masking flu before, don‚Äôt plan wear mask rest life risk poses vaccinated minimal. Closing schools protection unvaccinated adults. kids, although gets misconstrued. do, used properly, otherwise would infections healthcare workers. Unless immune system compromised, likely quite robustly protected symptomatic worse covid. Right worst heard post-vaccination covid Israel data, even people getting sick old, comorbid, impaired immune systems.

Wear mask public, especially indoors, worried, OK husband doesn't. likely inhale virus particles, give boost immune system increase level protection. No, preventable can't fix stupid.

Exactly. hard time calling people stupid last 5 years. problem anymore. talking vaccinated people. I'm clearly talking half America that's vaccinated. millions people filling hospitals soon deadly infectious someone pointed opens anyone lies connected outbreak damages expulsion violating University policy. I'd already said before. ratio new, smaller, constant value. US appears around 1% 100:1, UK directly measured around 0.2% 500:1 (but that's 28 days positive tests, true mortality rate could twice high). 4th wave crashing Missouri. makes feel better, thanks. Like explicitly stated: vaccines help temper inevitable rise hospitalizations. 

That said, always like beginning waves hospitalizations lag. Yeah lifespan middle aged. I'm starting think news US suggesting vaccinated hospitalizations unvaccinated ones would utterly destroy faith vaccines, regardless whether science suggests vaccination helps. Yeah really recently lot parents kids autism get shit antivaxers. family friend gets sorts homeopathic ideas help kid. Israel report Pfizer's efficacy around 60% Delta?

Which outlier pretty much countries reporting Israeli data looked raised eyebrows.  Compare Canadian study found, mind pre-print numbers line countries besides Israel coming I‚Äôm glad see this. I‚Äôve telling family friends go back masks. I‚Äôll admit got comfortable since vaccinated started going without one. week changed that. That's efficacy measured. 

Efficacy ratio vaccinated unvaccinated. ratio hospitalizations total cases vaccinated people. 

The reason isolate effects vaccine. Comparing total cases cases, even among unvaccinated, end hospitalizations. protection hospitalizations dependent vaccination. attempting count normal unvaccinated protection part protection vaccine.  use rabbits. Vaccinated 95% hospitalized sure point except able read articles studies done vs listening Joe Rogan Alex Jones? don‚Äôt trust subreddit one bit That‚Äôs sterilizing immunity. Immunity general infinitely broader certainly includes described. happens run Greek alphabet? THANK YOU.

Also, feel there‚Äôs still bit stigma around getting COVID? socially distanced, wore mask got vaccinated JNJ literally right could March. legit teared bus ride home knew life going normal* again. overnight, it‚Äôs first step.

Since I‚Äôve gone couple trips (Including CDC mask mandate lifted, wild) another one planned September. Even though I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm flying comply mask mandates.

I guess I‚Äôve mentally prepared fairly early COVID endemic consequences come that. Don‚Äôt get wrong, admire theory Aussies others trying constant lockdowns trying eradicate COVID, massive consequences, especially mental health related, I‚Äôm sure people unpacked starting to.  ‚ÄúHe wanted wait years see, know, there‚Äôs side effects anything it,‚Äù told WSB-TV. 

Idiot. Average life expectancy someone double-lung transplant believe 10 years. idiot dead 10.

He stupid stupidity killed him.

Idiot. second option. 

I wish still it, great info graphic showing mean time infection death. 
It things like days infection hospitalization correlated death risk. 
Fairly grim data, telling serious disease is, results predictable proper analysis data. question young vaccinate teens USA - answer 12yrs. 

The mRNA vaccines little extras chance truly allergic component rare. Literally one asking extra stuff wrote. US needs another stimulus check tied vaccinated.  friend mine go fund sisters medical bills accumulated month hospital past Jan covid. insurance, it‚Äôs fucking car payment essentially. 

And know without doubt many go fund me‚Äùs pop thousands covid survivors. able lay medical bills percent mean much now. millions unvaccinated people hospital filling making new record high numbers deadly infectious. hard. Everything opening doubt inside wearing mask.  UK‚Äôs current case average 75% peak last January 9% peak hospitalizations occurred roughly time. I'm sure, imagine combination both. based one Reddit commenter seemed knowledge. repeat first major outdoor event I've heard cause outbreak, definitely worth looking carefully jumping conclusions.  need spend lot education. I'm looking sort peer-reviewed data backs claims people frequently reinfected.  Neither links really supported that.  



It difficult produce evidence countries like US, UK, France, Germany many countries gone tens millions confirmed cases millions hospitalizations.  Logic bears reinfection sort significant issue, seeing sizable amount previously infected showing hospitals second third infections evidence simply knowledge. people talking risks vaccinating mass populations midst pandemic dangers creating selection forces. I've super hard time weighing words deciding antivax ones willing stick neck question narrative. lean towards latter days. Globalization hit antivax movement. growing every country. Well then, question becomes ""does firing someone getting vaccine"" qualify ""illegal reason"" at-will employment? Nothing covid statement ""it like athletes going compete both"" made google, athletes actually medaled winter summer Olympics. Though seems like one person year.

[Christa two medals 1988 winter Olympics held February 1988 Calgary -- gold 1000 meter speed-skating silver 500 meter speed-skating. 1988 summer Olympics held Seoul September 1988, silver 1000 meter sprint track cycling. like ""coerce"" people drink drive harms others. disagree. simply trust leaders world, rightfully so. sure question is. phase 3 trials. 

If looked link scrolled down, literally check dates. follows:

Estimated Primary Completion Date :November 2, 2021 

Estimated Study Completion Date :May 2, 2023

There ""extension."" Phase 3 Trial study running like designed do. No, described immunity.

You described sterilizing immunity. RSV also disease chronically underappreciated. super common disease increases chances asthma order magnitude.

And course big ass false equivalency first place. greoup effected least disease mile. (no matter introverted/extroverted are)

Not mention ""I actually know introvert is"" crowd. Y'know, ones go ""Oh glad lockdown I'm introvert lol"". pretty well known - CDC spelled page Flu, think lay people (other fellow germaphobes possibly) really paid attention viruses spread pandemic: Yes. point vaccines. stop getting seriously ill dying. you‚Äôre vaccinated catch COVID, worst you‚Äôll feel like crap days (like cold flu) fine. \*They\* die. Tories send people frontlines drinking g&amp;ts bunker. Old people likely vaccinated. worry much metric. humor? also seeing public figures (i.e. professional athletes, etc) Surge country? No. 60% cases unvaccinated. 40%, many 1 dose. also know nothing sever cases, icu, death. Spare random wrong analytic shared Waiting evidence based.

I've never seen put clearly. I'm going use this. download official government app &amp; upload vaccination documents day trip. It‚Äôll either approved denied confirmation number verified border. read someone else's comment here, summed perfectly:

People wear masks like good luck charm/amulet, really understand how, why, supposed protect.

They basically use rosary, strange mind they'll safe long them; whether chin, head, nose out, extremely loose, neck.

Don't matter doggies, I'm protected long - somehow.  guys actually real?! wtf

thanks help guess would know safe meet friends tests sensitive enough?

You don‚Äôt know. point, understand science enough (or enough faith understand better do) know fully vaccinated, safe you‚Äôre going get. Yes, breakthrough infections, generally speaking get one end symptomatic, fine. Odds things happening greatly reduced even encounter Delta variant.

If immunocompromised, living immune compromised person, living someone cannot get vaxxed (children)‚Äîyour risk calculation differ. assuming reasonably healthy comorbidities age 65, two weeks second vaccination, resume normal activities unless public health authorities area say otherwise. Trying get tested every social occasion waste time tests, unless someone social group unvaccinated due medical issues/age.

If still nervous, wear mask. simply adds another layer protection. *will Good! US track infections vaccinated people. US could seeing breakthrough rates Delta Israel know. 

The UK gave second doses later. you‚Äôre vaccinated, young healthy, better chance dying car crash struck lightning dying COVID. Stop worrying much. Could redo math 60% unvaccinated? That‚Äôs correction article is. Notice put tried best quotations. reason beat thing half americans still take seriously. haven't, getting put back lockdown mandates again. America it. saying give let overrun, never actually BEAT COVID now. 

Americans said, welp tried. ""lockdown"" thing work. vaccine people either take won't. reality hardly tried hard way get people cooperate second time around. people spread covid potentially kill someone‚Äôs loved ones too.

Someone doesn‚Äôt get pass selfishness someone loves them. choosing danger society. Geo Stigma Variant mostly older people hospitalized COVID. 95% 65 people UK vaccinated. 40% hospitalizations coming vaccinated old people 60% unvaccinated, would mean vaccination better 95% effective preventing hospitalization.

You thousand old people. 950 vaccinated. 4 got put hospital. 50 unvaccinated, 6 got put hospital.  Here's latest technical briefing English deaths page 17. agree many wear correctly. even % partial masking others reduction nonetheless. need concerted effort get. position inherently weak-minded one. looks like work really well. Everything‚Äôs control, situation normal. 

We slight novel virus outbreak uh everything‚Äôs perfectly alright now, we‚Äôre fine. We‚Äôre fine here, thank you. you? Low infected SARS-CoV-2 contact surfaces. However, based available epidemiological data studies environmental transmission factors, surface transmission main route SARS-CoV-2 spreads, risk considered low.  turn implies delta isn‚Äôt much effect efficacy infections it‚Äôs made state? thought deaths among fully vaccinated v rare? I'm comforted long COVID symptoms seem start within weeks months infection. I'd like think issue breakthrough cases post vaccination we'd seeing now.

Edit: Uh, no, California known covid west, lol. I‚Äôve lived west coast never heard that. Even 60% good. 60% hospitalizations vaccinated people, means vaccine 85% effective. also: child parents, field, abstaining she‚Äôs also surrounded whole country MANY loudly saying vaccine bad.  absolutely wish everybody else vaccinated, blaming kid life experience knowledge get anyway pretty harsh Might work weak minded, selfishness good thing. work anti vaxxers don‚Äôt mask reverse also true. athletes supposed vaccinated? ???  Hmm.. doctors treating covid patients across country also took like full year even admit long haul covid thing. guarantee easiest way associate unvaccinated people. UK data uses lot questionable assumptions models, fro. ones I've seen. course, even data Israeli one, IDK sound.

But here's another idea - article says Israel thinks vaccines' protection starting wear off. Well, true, mKes q lot sense would happen Israel UK/Canada, people getting second doses later.   There's one replace them. Gf works elder care facility would love require vaccinations staff literally keep place open did.  UK adult population: 85% least one dose, 65% two doses mid-July. shots AZ., People get shamed selfishness damn time. Case fatality rates across variants comparable according article cited. Maybe. lot us you. mainly hitting unvaccinated. That‚Äôs true. Quit dramatic. love called hero living like hermit, something even pandemic, longer feel ashamed body temple - know someone like getting bc worried side effects - told life precious get point Olympics dumb. Ugh, none matters.. people still quoting garbage? mean, crazy thought, chances understanding risks new form vaccine better talking news heads Reddit posts? totally understand point would probably pass something like tetanus shot even flu shot....however knowing could miss competition whole even symptoms seems way worse risk missing one two days training couple months event. Yes. think Israel's data trusted anymore. remember Pfizer cancelled shipment Israel demanding payment? ever since then, Israel releasing data poking holes efficacy Pfizer beta variant delta variant. pretty much politicized garbage now.

FWIW He's reelection year. leaning way.  I'm sorry deny science

Says guy worried relatively highly vaccinated young, healthy, relatively small cohort fatalities. California considered many Florida west I'm surprised people went disobeyed covid restrictions caught it. ""because I've accepted entire world copied lockdowns 2020, pandemic never really end China reopens borders signals world OK.""

Lol  This. studies done (I never save sources, sorry) even infected, vaccine kills virus serious symptoms arise etc, also means vaccinated people shed less virus making harder around catch it. also cases cruise ship required passengers vaccinated. 2 people tested positive cruise (a couple sharing cabin) one else. 2 people probably infected cruise unvaccinated transmit virus anyone board...

For every article I've read stated above, contradicting article. still go ""I think anyone really knows sure"" Well sort one thread talking athlete question.  Except fact healthcare facilities *already* understaffed since Covid started. honor system, must show proof  hope story least blows enough maybe help young people understand consequences getting sick. safe go nightclubs now, protective measures, September require double jab status? makes sense.‚Äù

Why option negative test well?  wrong later corrected 40%. Twitter! called press conference correct huge error. wouldnt surprise certain organizations trying spread intentionally.  loved ones okay they're vaccinated? comment someone clueless Well it‚Äôs young crowd getting covid now. surprising hospitalization/death high. people likely hospitalized, people 65, 95% vaccinated. vaccination reduces high risk hospitalization low risk experienced much younger people. consider fully vaccinated day got it. title misleading? Mississippi 34% fully vaccinated, tying dead last Alabama. Mississippi also fattest, poorest, diabetic state.

A lot people Mississippi going around Christmas. odds happening, vaccines 66-95% effective (and sounds like, wasn‚Äôt J&amp;J two jabs), that‚Äôs good, right?

I understand vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective, taking population 100% vaccinated 60% test positive COVID, doesn‚Äôt hinder efficacy vaccines? Less deadly versions- know, like article talking about, reverse. Mind blowing got downvoted. cautioned lack observed post-Covid-19 cases vaccinated people ""just might lag time issue."" is, Covid-19 vaccinations started rolling en masse within past three four months, possible enough time passed identify long-haul patients following Natasha Altman, cardiologist UCHealth University Colorado Hospital Aurora, agreed may soon understand vaccines' effects long-term Covid-19 think trends going really going start bearing next six months,"" vaccines proven dramatically cut risk Covid-19 infection general, shots remain ""one best ways lower risk getting post-Covid syndrome,"" Vanichkachorn estimated third Covid-19 cases may result long-term illness. suggests nearly 34 million people diagnosed Covid-19 United States, 11 million may endure consequences illness months years.

Summary - know vaccines reduce death miniscule number. that's great news! think reduce long covid, also great news! but, know months get data. : ( Got upvote required full vaccinations every participant.  theory ever going proven never know. Chinese authorities destroyed whatever evidence long time ago bet. obsession saving face precludes admitting blunder would bring upon worldwide contempt shame. Missouri Arkansas providing opposite observation right now. Hospitals around hotspots way worse previous waves.

The difference might rates vaccinations two cases. science clear then. end devastating 100 year pandemic, death, lifelong disabilities causing, trillions dollars lost economic activity, need make vaccines mandatory. don‚Äôt want vaccine, OK, can‚Äôt live society anymore. many reasons already  like media scared everyone silly called ""highly transmissible Delta variant"", scaring everyone silly ""breakthrough infections"". concept idiotic, rocket fuel antivax movement. asymptomatic

I feel like that‚Äôs wrong word someone getting heart damage virus  Helping* Same, cant handle another winter fearing COVID 24/7. ended getting it. want again.  Kids haven‚Äôt even schools.

Kids lot places attending in-person school since September.  There's sizable enough number across various US states European nations draw conclusions from. guess spend much time sub area changed classes normal last year, masks required much distancing possible. year still planned. Less quarter teens gotten vaccinated. several clusters schools, spread mostly bad last year. I‚Äôm worried delta low vaccination rates, year could see spread don‚Äôt mandate masks. Happened here. felt weird dripping feeling lungs sore months months went away like week Pfizer shots  analogy perfect, one simple enough people visualize it. current context, enemy team striked goal yet, chance shooting starting increase they're getting closer goal. makes sense goalie would decrease enemy's chance scoring shoot. gap 1st 2nd dose 5 weeks recommended gap 3 weeks Pfizer. 5 week gap okay? yes, people dumb   level immunity 1st vaccine dose?  think last sentence makes sense, I'll wait hear case researched more. Olympics aren‚Äôt happening, they?  They're Olympic athletes, Rhodes scholars lol. Run Forrest run! Yes main issue seems be... people would rather catch covid instead getting vaccine.

I actually hope future would mRNA flu chance even flu eradicated (provided people grown accustomed mRNA vaccines) Ohhh myyyyy. thought brings tears eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

^(Tears of) **^(joy)**^(, is.) Whenever see that, please, please report remove ban! No, misunderstood me. 

I'm saying said DOING. do, doing. 

If vaccinated person gets positive test, counted overall case count numbers. monitoring investigating see vaccinated not, unless hospitalized (in case are). long keep schools open follow whatever restrictions want. cannot handle another year distance learning. mean to, might need ship loony bin after. Bingo. like dealing children. people complaining people keeping going. Making ""us"" work much harder. Smh Finally!

What yet understand is...what gain denying science? got pandering. I‚Äôm sorry. parent Florida right thankfully hasn‚Äôt gotten sick yet refuses get vaccinated. also watches lot Tucker Carlson, unfortunately. Thanks clarification!! states really well vaccinations could lift them, whole country? people actually locked two weeks really flattened curve, might much better numbers. people social distanced masked, might better numbers. people would get vaccinated, would better numbers.

We know things work. point countries tried sorts different strategies managed much better outcomes. 

The real goalpost mattered ""When new cases level manage, pounce minor outbreaks appear."" Unfortunately, we've never gotten country whole managed reach goalposts. 

The goalposts moving piss people off. They're moving become next goal actually chance get us situation. We're failing them. vaccinated people catch covid recover also gain natural immunity? Hospitalizations lag that. always have. 

Anyway, look increases percentages, hospitalizations going high rate. 2 weeks ago, sure now. 18 months solutions really working due ""compliance issues"".  


we get flatter curve last year July. screwed winter holidays pretty bad though. 


[Da Please Simone Biles Please Simone Biles difference US UK younger age group wait longer get shots, used AstraZeneca, less effective Delta, longer delay doses vs US anyone 12 older walk get shots time. 

It's going interesting see plays US vs UK. know prediction would hot spots, especially less vaccinated areas, starting play now. people saying focus less cases hospitalization deaths time around. I‚Äôm responding cause browns helmet, play devils advocate, also don‚Äôt know long term complications vaccines may either. I‚Äôm suggesting Might all, argument made. outbreak 1k people one event stay true. *WELL MUNDANE DETAIL, PATRICK!* bottomless pit bullshit. number die hard anti vaxxers highly doubt ever happen. wonder anti-vaxxers view covid ""survival fittest"" hoping people view inferior die off. 

100% this. Part reason ignored national level hitting poor minorities hardest. Could different vaccines? *said* testing daily, including president, responses followup questions made unclear true. Also, president encountered many people besides would treated daily. Long Covid big part vaccine trials hospitalization deaths unknown vaccines sure it. 

Suffering year-long full blown Long COVID chronical fatigue syndromes (brain fog, fatigue) considered \*MILD\* disease COVID vaccine trials (AZ, Moderna, JnJ, Pfizer, Novavax), long hospitalization (usually low oxygen). understand design study. question general differences/similarities tracking phase 3 subjects past primary endpoints vs post marketing surveillance/phase 4 trials. suspending horrible person traitor? Cardboard not, want fuck they‚Äôre gonna find way fuck. Yeah feel like implementing safe areas would unfair thoses actually took care got vaccinated Thank you. 

I know...Japan scaring lately. Hopefully manoeuvre delta leave!  mean?  everyone would required vaccine one would care. :/ 10 days typical quarantine, daughter Covid April year. way worked secondary schools (middle high school QC) stay one class like primary school. 
In QC, teenagers 79% getting vaccinated. That‚Äôs awesome hope works normal school year. realize confirmed vaccinated people transmit virus. Thank you. think going get anything! also happy fully 12 days leaving.

So...SOME protection 0 protection. Yeah point linking op Ed- especially wsj- little sus . It‚Äôs objective thing

Quick googling reveals author written times - Covid classic order R0 2-3. Alpha closer 4, Delta like 6 IIRC. linear scale either, R0 exponential term. Delta pretty crazy. We're lucky happening vaccines earlier. 

Here's article graph showing difference covid classic delta: area high vaccination low cases? fine. toxic hellstorm virus 20% people vaxxed? Scale back. That's works. sure getting downvoted saying what's obviously true Depends ask. I've seen lot subreddit share sentiment everything right follow rules convince someone covid get vaccine?

They show try convince current rate vaccination state, would hit 70% vaccination March... people actually got vaccine. I'm sure Missouri provide breeding ground covid years future. Ok buddy. Tell that. LMAO!!! seen immunologists suggests mutation caliber would likely big enough mutation make Covid dangerous us. mrna vaccines also lot effective flu vaccines. don‚Äôt know better rate airport it‚Äôs $150 CAD testing documentation major pharmacies city.  Yeah? don‚Äôt care.

Shit like isn‚Äôt pushing get vaccinated. Start running articles people regretting getting vaccinated dying. Run articles kids don‚Äôt mom dad anymore Covid killed them.

Run articles otherwise healthy people needing double lung transplants.

Telling reservoir sever Covid like badge honour them. insurance companies charge lower monthly premiums fully vaccinated person odds death COVID-19 much less fully vaccinated person? actually well known. dramatically reduces transmission believe him. He‚Äôs credible interviews. carries 5x viral load grab onto cells lot better.

The vaccines tested something like   least they‚Äôre fully vaccinated expect basically none come severe form virus.   Well huge numbers unvaccinated want Biden succeed. vaccinated invalidate beliefs Trump Biden same. Yes outdoors king! even say upwind lol. family also situation. great aunt Alabama boat. Instead never got vaccinated ventilator.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* take VAERS grain salt consider every self-reported long COVID account gospel? though natural immunity better vaccine?  think real test whether eradicate covid fast escapes vaccines.

It's worth pointing South African variant (B.1.351 / Beta) escapes antibodies much better B.1.617.2 / Delta. looks like evolutionary trend optimizing speed/infectiousness rather immune-evasion.   source claim sentiment genuine real facts?  case observable difference.

That said, I'm going disdain regular medication favour essential oils. useful supplement, miraculous cure-all. It‚Äôs anecdotal govt initially told us wear masks decided stop tracking ‚Äúnon-serious‚Äù breakthrough cases. fast-tracking booster don‚Äôt even need it? hot take age like milk.   Covid misinformation spreading like Covid.  Something tells lot receipts vaccination fake.

Why create bar codes Picture scanned. way fake cards would flagged, people cited breaking (new law). long event survey happen? stock market today certainly thinks ""Statistical anomaly! happen me."" - young educated idiots Time physically separate good? job course wants make money. Problem thing Media made look like black plague lot people jumped bandwagon. 

Getting sick fun exaggeration happening especially new variant something else. ran across COVID-19 School Response Dashboard (US); data seems suggest mask wearing little effect spreading Coronavirus. correct misinterpreting /r/unexpectedmullaney Agree everything, also monitoring admissions anecdotal evidence. would double check status antigen test‚Ä¶ thought considered valid proof negative COVID status.

I'm currently working 5 different facilities every one, 9 10 staff unvaccinated. Every RCF Springfield/Greene County reinstitute lockdowns rise cases, damn staff refuse get vaccinated...

At least residents vaccinated. One facility 3 staff test positive week, residents (a testament success vaccines).

Last year, covid ravaged facility (caring primarily elderly ALF well RCF), killing residents, incapacitating them, caused **all** isolated rooms served food meds 100% could leave. even allowed open windows months....

You'd think staff would vaccinated that... nope, Missery. hate age ignorance scientifically illiterate citizens we're living right now. conned profit-seeking attention whores media online. religious health exemptions, hospitals health care facilities understaffed, supposed screened everyday, I‚Äôm back wearing mask indoors.

Hold beer. denying horrific child face ICU care, reason release actual hard numbers. so?   could still fathom GOP could lockdowns mask mandates worst still haven‚Äôt understood anti-vax sentiment. Trump literally trying get credit vaccines. Heck November December Democrats criticizing Trump pushing vaccine ahead political agenda said wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine. don‚Äôt even know GOP become anti-vax. Anti-vaccine one movements didn‚Äôt actually begin right coopted do, buddy.  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm longer wearing mask. No. Health insurance companies relatively limited set personal data use discriminate costs policies, certainly isn‚Äôt granular whether someone vaccine.

In states may able offer rebate bonus people get vaccine, might act functional discount though. got  issue vaccinated pcr tests non vaccinated.  Maybe loop back around start Alpha-1. Boring, though, might suggest relation between, example, Alpha Alpha-1 variants even though none. Yep covid Nov 2020 1st shot wrecked I'm getting 2nd later week hope bad worse hey better getting covid twice orders worse it.

I somewhat mild times almost considered going hospital anxiety super bad tike I'm sure help.

and I'm would consider healthy 26 year old yeah virus care healthy not.

But im sure know wish experience consider lucky get debilitating long term symptoms 

(I fatigue, body aches weeks infection chest wall inflammation.

Also shortness breath eventually went away. Well, covid risk better wording it. Concerns makes sound like head, COVID absolutely spreading medical centers killing weakened people. really. leave subreddit pulls back ""The common cold"" actually variety different virus families, generally extremely contagious. Basically everyone know started getting colds soon started relaxing things post-vaccination. mean, significantly transmissible version Covid pretty fucking bad, even deadlier. ThEyRe CeNsOrInG uS!!!

-buy freedom phone Jesus Christ like every single comment got removed‚Ä¶ fuck happened think Israel used Pfizer, no? They're 100% focused midterms building momentum. MTGs comments Trump coming back August cements that.   Ban permanently. She‚Äôs going obnoxious repeat offender save us poison spews  media 4 days symptoms hospitalization aged 60+ study (see section 3.1). imagine takes 4 14 days symptoms emerge, infection-hospitalization lag 8 18 days.

Also, wasted time feed something should‚Äôve looked Phase III trial data shows effect 2 weeks, start get immunity. mean seldom get stds right maybe genetically superior? Don‚Äôt Fauci ventilators! Got months ago üòÄ  shitty sounds it‚Äôs accurate, least anecdotal personal experiences. Startup costs club fairly low though. it‚Äôs actually safe, within months decent number clubs. Lol get vaccine dude based calculation ~54% UK population fully vaccinated might biased younger unvaccinated less likely hospitalised.

Another way splicing data like zuma15 suggested based age groups. give different results. revenue getting anyways. Pfizer lead US.  J&amp;J trouble ramping production approved last started behind stayed behind US.

Pfizer ships larger lots, tighter constraints storage temperatures, must diluted thawing, shelf life measured hours that; talk Pfizer would allocated large vaccination sites could deal better high maintenance nature, Moderna J&amp;J steered smaller sites. 

CDC dose stats (doses delivered, doses administered people vaccinated) found towards bottom There‚Äôs much unpack I‚Äôm even going begin try start it. Good luck future. Ah! thing spanish, ""asistir"", definitely slip hahaha 
My head mess lately, speak english work, spanish family, japanese streets lol fear. hope get point, we're 50% US still possibility.  cheaper chaos caused anti-vaxxers new strain comes along locks us (or worse). small window time fix don't, going disastrous. Outbreaks heavily vaccinated countries means it‚Äôs stay.

Countries like Israel, UAE, UK best compliance far, they‚Äôre still seeing case numbers rise.

It‚Äôs going mitigation, eradication point. Australia must stolen mean weird prancy horse stuff called sport. Yeah see reason would get 12 hour ban Trump permabanned. Yep, going continue living like forever? get certain oils something.

UK may set world back months anything worse Delta spreads there. found bc curious. article others made seem like CDC wasn‚Äôt tracking breakthrough infections took mean positive results post vaccination. call Yeah, heard implied today Columbus Ohio talk radio station switching channels. even watching Olympics point?  Unfortunately fear US see large divergence cases deaths UK seeing older populations US refused vaccine. someone vaccinated get COVID, nothing really changed compared start pandemic. US counties seeing spikes vaccination rates low 30%. good. really huge difference US vaccination rates, unfortunately populations low vaccine uptake seem clump together. give liberty give death bullshit got stop. virus might outright kill don‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt fuk ways. People playing Russian roulette what? gymnast usually gets one chance Olympics since changed age rules sport. I'm sure devastating thing trained since toddler never get compete.

Gymnasts usually done 20, that's ""old"" gymnast.  Distribution Logistics Always challenge. uh they‚Äôll leave bedside. personally know 15+ nurses left bedside year. I‚Äôm way too. It‚Äôs bunch bullshit constantly happened long time ago.

Great it, MTG posting misinformation COVID pretty much since beginning pandemic. take long take action? Twitter complicit vaccine hesitancy problem. I've places seem dangerously close outright banning masks. I've store clerks tell thieves would wear ""fake virus BS"" finally past. completely agree fact strong disincentives towards getting vaccine. Unfortunately isn‚Äôt reality in. one seems political so. 

Which think frustrates many people suggesting ‚Äúhey require masks make people get shots.‚Äù second part clearly isn‚Äôt happening real world time soon, masks haven‚Äôt worn last 6+ months (or have, minimally) areas low vaccine uptake. George Romero presents dawn anti Vaxxer. harsh shit show happening. ‚ÄúThere 19‚Äâ543 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections period interest, 377 admitted hospital COVID-19; 7723 (39¬∑5%) cases 134 (35¬∑5%) hospital admissions gene-positive (appendix p 3).‚Äù

Pretty small sample size study. article give even single number statistic regarding children health department said children ages 5 17 making 30% new COVID-19 cases county.

Cases /= hospitalizations Hurricane names? Ironic gynnastics totally rigged? Got there, lieutenant Even someone like still confused never ending mixed public health messaging. wonder general population doesn‚Äôt even care anymore. 18 year old offered it. 16-17 years olds vulnerable offered months ago part earlier cohorts. Government scientists recommended vulnerable 12-15 year olds (cancer, syndrome etc) live vulnerable adults. won‚Äôt approve vaccinating healthy 12+ kids evidence comes benefits outweigh risks. 17yos months away 18th birthday offered fully vaccinated hit 18. Yeah. support Brazil strong call ""Fura fila"". Persons basically trying fake requirements get vaccine.

Like, men people pretending woman pregnant get vaccine right now, 2.822 ""pregnant men"" applied doses. ü§∑ Half people vaccinated Delta variant twice contagious compared original strain. Since restrictions much looser compared last summer, surprising cases spiking much, more. shit Sherlock. 

Tell firefighters servicemen coal miners. much risk everyday life. 

If covid shot means .0097% chance getting covid even smaller chance developing moderate severe systems even smaller chance dying I'M gonna take chance. Anyone vaccinated gets sick them. vaccine becomes FDA approved likely. rather charging theyre far likely refuse coverage covid hospitalization entirely unvaxd. mid-state fair coming up... wonder that's gonna go.... Getting angry people wearing masks makes fucking sense. Anti-maskers incredibly brainwashed. think expecting get worse last last year US unlikely, delta variant far, far infectious. easily enough parts US lower vaccination rates get hit harder. Get Rt 1 keep there. Masks absolutely necessary that. need put strong disincentives vaccinated. Disincentives severe it‚Äôll take country 50% vaccinated 90% vaccinated. need look pharmaceutical companies see figure vaccine even better efficacy delta understand already working on. Vaping short term wouldnt fry lungs. We'd know already. dont know long term effects perhaps short term effects actively vaping. all, simply day smoking cessation lungs begin rebuild. assumed vapor similar sort active damper lungs even short term could fade shortly immediately cessation.

But ultimately dont research say one way another. guess got edited. missing ‚Äúh‚Äù would result interpretation random visual images think want avoid. thanks saving day. missing ‚Äúh‚Äù understand that. I‚Äôm simply pointing hospitalizations deaths aren‚Äôt important numbers need focus here. anyone loved ones age 60 made respect prior covid? end humanity know I'd it. without precedent: CDC ripped Tips Former Smokers campaign NYC pretty well [against I'd compile survivors COVID, straight PSA campaign. sounds awesome. doesn‚Äôt government give free money medicine? get vaccine great, I‚Äôd rather make insulin cheaper pay people thousands dollars take covid vaccine. huge part dispersed infection is. Getting super spreader events chained together cause enormous long term increases cases. compare infection rates communities similar vaccination rates, population densities, masking, contact etc. place gets hit random. Where's Omnipotent variant? Maybe less cheesburgers then? Vaccines absolutely needed, that‚Äôs it. Masks help point. help delay inevitable unless everyone gets vaccinated. Well, happen. vaccine didn‚Äôt fully protect me. I‚Äôm dead, didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfully protect‚Äù me. What‚Äôs point here? Obviously people get vaccinated, many breakthrough cases there, look covid positive sub. Florida Florida help push through, true. many supporters interested getting it, information mind? Interesting observation, really far-off. Hard prove grander social science scale good theory presented. link ever seen someone confused before. I've never seen anybody write article anything. 

But case count numbers positive tests. always way. positive tests never excluded case counts. idea would think otherwise. Damn can‚Äôt read German! Cursed born America! Jokes aside, thanks. jfc Get vaccine? Could be? think meant say ""definitely are"". really. India used some, cases went down. proves exactly nothing, since we've seen cases go places use too.  Grift. Sadly, coffers pretty full.   someone help clarify things?

My family 4 (2 US &amp; CAD duel citizens + 2 CAD citizens) travelling Toronto, New Rochelle, NY urgent family + business trip us received 1st dose. second dose scheduled August 1st US (3 week timeframe) need cross rhe border prior that. going get rapid antigen test 72 hrs prior crossing border besides that, anything worried about? 

Do think they'll allow us cross border problem? verify vaccination status? fairness, Covid mutates slower influenza, vaccines much effective flu vaccines. Moot points though enough people get vaccinated. Unfit: Donald Trump documentary explains perfectly. Recommended watch. really unfortunate. I'm rooting unvaccinated reality checks responsible people losing opportunity fun. Question please. non vaccinated person class covid, point 10 days stop shedding? Sorry bother you. seems like knowledgeable. I‚Äôm vaccinated happy read strength Moderna/Pfizer delta variant long 2 weeks past second shot. Thanks great day/night. great, probably nice people spend time with.

Oh, mean terms safety severe disease? quite safe. Cite please. ""Struggling"" defend Delta stretch. We're still looking efficacy rates scientists would've delighted earliest phase vaccine development.

Plus protection severe/fatal COVID still incredibly high. virus slips vaccine COVID day mild affair, mean vaccine ""failed"", still made infection hell lot manageable would've vaccine. almost 60 percent, that's sobering I'm one putting words others' mouths.

But, nice strawman.

Why invested point? real.

Because seem able leave alone. months Centers Disease Control Prevention said vaccinated individuals didn‚Äôt need wear masks settings, growing number experts warning it‚Äôs time put back Los Angeles County, rising menace posed delta variant coronavirus prompted health officials reimpose mask mandate. Then, Bay Area health officers Friday recommended residents seven counties city Berkeley, Calif., resume wearing masks indoors. Mask mandates discussed, too, coronavirus hot spots Arkansas Missouri, cases sharply increased recent weeks many residents remain unvaccinated.  sub everything catastrophe, name better duo [archive link anyone trouble accessing article yes. fine. Experts mostly recommend trying take things like Advil right get vaccine way prevent symptoms mutations could also make masks less effective, since often masks decrease viral load amount transmission Ironically mistake made press conference. US related, would assume applies Europe. Hopefully slow Bezo‚Äôs rocket too. Lex Luther mfer doesn‚Äôt deserve reach space try escape news. 10 year old left school halfway third grade March 2020. homeschooled since. need send back how? worse last year afraid miss another year return new school 6th grader isolated 2 years...I can't deal anymore. antivaxxers te bullshit. Sorry losses, broh.  reported cases 2 days? Clearly cases, they're reporting based see worldometers Google IOC ridiculous. know isn‚Äôt right mindset but, get it. invested lot money something would upset too. Although, money-hungry. care surpassing explosiveness Beijing 2008 games brought. People getting sick Olympics cares ‚Äútradition‚Äù. people don‚Äôt care tradition anymore. Japan doesn‚Äôt even want happen anymore. wouldn‚Äôt surprised another variant born. (I pray I‚Äôm wrong.) understand completely majority elderly Japan would vaccinated well athletes. vaccinated go abroad, right? need protect vaccinated? expect over?    shut country someone flu?

That stop going work?

Your argument doesn‚Äôt hold validity That's false, far I'm aware. least FFP2 whatever US equivalent is. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  think least partially largely true. what's fudging analysis actually know sure quickly new strain moving among even mostly vaccinated populations. Thanks large part CDC actively *not* reporting breakthrough cases. 
 
 
I suspect difference really vaccinated populations much slower daily-cases growth curve. positive, appears. last one realize point testing protect Japanese public spread Covid well athletes. It‚Äôs keep safe get medical attention needs it. Opening borders perhaps worst time delta spreading like wildfire states. understand professions potentially getting pass damn stupid overall.  advanced? proven greater tendency mutate viruses? Furthermore anything suggest likely mutate deadlier variant viruses? Otherwise care taken forms virus.

We would also distance mask animals enforce globally. seems completely nuts. ""I got Pfizer need nothin' else"" people bad anti vaxers cult thinking.

I hate say trope but.. *both sides*.. 
 
Shouldn't surprise anyone though. would character disposition (political leaning) universally correct other? course fools sides. difference leadership, autonomous figures, direct control permits fools. 
 
Fortunately one half country sane pandemic other. seems leadership gone all-in foolery become unyielding position (vax &amp; done) half (let 'er rip masks). sides hard-headed immune facts. Same. 18 month old. getting shitter shitter go freaking grocery store without someone space. School starts 2 weeks cant ask college students wear masks. like ""hell ya! HHN"" I'm like ""fuck even go work expose kid"". Right said? Covid preventing anything. positive test government guidelines preventing participating. completely fine.  easily get tested free countries.   don‚Äôt know assume would want previous administration policing speech putting people jail social media post. That‚Äôs really arrest Arlene anyone else doubles quackery. It‚Äôs bad precedent. former fencer wielded diplomacy guile drag Games across finish line, even pandemic, like not. fair suggestions. unfortunately there's stomach moves right now.

I completely understand healthy disposition acknowledging limits control. There's sense getting frustrated whether rains shine, that's power. 
 
But applying sort resignation *our will* things productive good.. that's healthy. That's loser mentality. like saying sounds crass else describe it? 
 
We're incompetent civil body right apparently everyone okay that. 
Smart phones food delivery, bread circus guess.   I'm south know lot healthcare workers vaccinated. also saw TikTok (not best source) friend sent video nurse trying organize hospital protests vaccine mandates hospitals implementing. feel bad healthcare workers (my mom works healthcare) hurts know believe vaccine here.  Looks like we‚Äôre go worldwide rolling lockdowns coming months. unfortunate couldn‚Äôt pin sooner. She‚Äôs isolated Japan unable participate Olympics she‚Äôs trained attend life.  know this, vaccinated. want too. fact asshole always involved math. assholes get vaccinated and/or believe contagious others not.

A fourth wave always seemed inevitable based immutable fact.

Also would like point sustainability economy uncontrollable force caught wake of. Ponzi scheme forced ignore avoid falling depression. record profits 2020. stock market soaking while, yet none ""trickled down"". IOC FIFA might lot account for, even governments.  Covid factory everyone vaccinated tested negative people vaccinated allowed take Jansen vaccine immediatly go party without wait 2 weeks works. ""dancing jansen"" campaign get young people vaccinate themselves. Minister health even said get young people vaccinate numbers low enough handle spread. Pretty much vaccinated cause huge infections. Keep relying US data ‚ÄúThe number breakthrough cases largely unknown CDC shifted tracking breakthrough infections resulted hospitalization death starting May 1.‚Äù 

72% efficacy vs Delta infection means breakthrough infections rather common. 

Severe breakthrough still rare. mild/asymptomatic breakthrough infections common. 

Singapore uses Pfizer Moderna, Covid vaccines approved yet. Additionally, I'd like add huge number ""breakthrough"" infections asymptomatic. good data evidence suggest asymptomatic carriers lower viral dose less likely spread virus. % vaccinated among hospitalized doesn‚Äôt really say anything. Consider last year 100% hospitalized unvaccinated. vaccinated everyone we‚Äôd see 100% vaccinated among hospitalized. Many countries strict border controls - Korea Vietnam name two region - many cases China and/or serious trouble bringing outbreaks control.

China's success *incredibly* pervasive surveillance network. government ability track individual movement extreme. Still, figures quite puzzling - doubt cases low, life pretty much back 2019 China anyway, surprised numbers cooked bit. one ever said vaccines aren‚Äôt good anything. they‚Äôre supposed do, prevent death, doesn‚Äôt prevent spread. 

You still want wear mask avoid getting even mildly sick especially pass someone else. 

Just legally don‚Äôt wear mask anymore doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt. Link doesn‚Äôt work, thread virologist:

The you. short frolic history shows active topic seeming get much headway.

Your confidence matching I'm seeing. I'm measuring success whether I'm hospitalized, I'm measuring ability work every day. completely agree you. People sub basically pretending vaccines ineffective. science back that. no, nothing 100% effective. Seatbelts 100% effective still drive car. half country said ""1% mortality rate, psh that's nothing. let's get lives masks"" half country saying "".5% mortality rate (for vaccinated people contract it), psh that's nothing. let's get lives masks"" - reasonable people getting flanked. 
 
There incidents virus managing (slowly) run [entirely vaccinated *both* halves country dont NPI regulations. pretty sure sperm quality declines wake fever... inevitable collision politics public health. happen time anyone fever? talking 'standard' postviral fatigue malaise, creative manifestations (anosmia, myocarditis, etc) spike protein gets cells. gets easier, faster, consistently, would make less dangerous?  drive stubborn assholes control resistance narrative.

The problem people can't get exceptionalist egos.  would devastating anyone. J&amp;J‚Äôs early numbers hold may one effective Delta variant. would bother comment understanding statistic means all? Could please stop articles like this? morons looking articles like purposes. crazy part actually got vaccine, actually paid attention golden calf, they'd vaccinated safe now. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Israel - 2,091.95   European travel ban Spring 2020. Trump given hard time said travel bans work I'm you! feel like island sanity amongst sea ignorance selfishness. I'm 1% still masking. maddening 99% think nutter. people also coming communities lower vaccination rates. 7-day average COVID deaths 2. fuck 2 deaths day result headline says ""deaths rise""? always going new variant.

True slow rate appear means fewer deaths period time effective vaccine. Since current variant crushing Missouri India, things would still pretty bad even everyone vaccinated. complaining selfish third worlders shouting ""DARWINISM!"" ""idc die reap sow"" seems distasteful huh?

Just watch happening UK Isreal vaccinated numbers way higher (pushing high 70%) let guess, anti vaxxer south US directly related uptick infections hospitalizations right?

Oh yeah since need say it, I've got moderna shots, got months ago. Exactly  Doubtful unlike USA vaccine uptake vulnerable groups pretty good. time around NHS may well barely notice. 86 ‚ÄúMainland China recorded 65 new confirmed cases 19 July, compared 31 day earlier, National Health Commission said statement Tuesday. since 30 January, 92 new cases reported.‚Äù  50% Israel's 9 million people vaccinated, 33 serious cases 4.5 million fully vaxxed people also proof vaccines working IMO.

this sentence completely false reverse say unvaccinated holds even weight... So, fully vaccinate people wear mask, go restaurant friends? bar? music concert sporting event? simply wearing mask supermarket enough destroy COVID? It‚Äôs one life‚Äôs greater pleasures. Maybe reach preschool ask handle children still getting used wearing masks?

Over 2 year olds supposed wear masks school understand it‚Äôs like instant turn 2 kid put mask perfectly. new children ages joining time, they‚Äôre new preschool it‚Äôs understandable they‚Äôre used wearing mask yet. work kids, like another commenter mentioned - sometimes comes teacher, kid reacts differently. Plus peer pressure seeing kids wear masks might help! 

In meantime, kiddo going you, maybe practice wearing mask then? you‚Äôre getting ready idea attending preschool maybe throw ‚Äúand wear masks go school‚Äù try putting wearing mask. 

Good luck, hope works kiddo.  guys masked 70%+ vaxxed? Yes is. Bro im double vaxxed lmao They‚Äôre obnoxious make harder communicate. Damn, Adam Vaughan seems like biggest douche bag, sorry deal him. Montreal sounds decent, Vancouver? thought action happening West Coast. Talking mask mandates unvaxxed. mandate vaxx minimum mandate masks them. Even half put masks reduction spread/mutations etc. I'm though mandate vaxx preferably via insurance companies, vaxx passports etc. saying also applies someone presenting nightmarish anecdotal experience. people morons. sheer amount huberus sides discussion frankly astounding. Everybody seems screaming things never stopping consider may know every single fucking thing know. There's high horses tall they'd dwarf Eiffel tower. Soap boxes stacked ten miles high thousand miles deep.

So maybe need step fuck back second make sure indeed answers start forming angry fucking mobs. Masks pain impede communication.  Oregon go well. could potentially choke mask freak accident. Yeah it‚Äôs fucking crazy statistics work large sample sizes, isn‚Äôt it? Anyone doesn‚Äôt damn good reason gotten vaccinated doesn‚Äôt deserve protecting. No. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed. Could be? That‚Äôs selling softly. Pick pick up! Standing crowds listen music together. Everybody enough intelligence party *in middle pandemic*

Sorry it‚Äôs inconvenient get near people you‚Äôre listening music. Must really nice able stand near again. Good thing pretend *fucking pandemic* isn‚Äôt going otherwise would enjoy music without people standing close us? Nice Avi sound *excited* that? federal judge he‚Äôs expected impartial. haven‚Äôt seen anything judge conservative, liberal otherwise. CoV2 is, sadly, really dastardly virus. Much advanced given Adenovirus. probably distancing masking forever least extent, least seasonally. kind thing recover would permanently damaged? feel like people like willfully ignorant delta variants ability escape neutralization. Yeah likely wont need much medical care infected even risk shit body risk long covid. dad needs continue avoid groups people especially indoor setting. continue wear mask out. 

I'm 67 looks like delta variant spread rapidly decent data hard find. best plan keep exposure minimum make sure viral load pick minimal exposed. We‚Äôve requiring masks 2 year olds since close start pandemic I‚Äôve gotten see little ones adapt wearing masks school. 

Yeah, gonna take wearing masks first. practice time (and maybe experimenting different masks), little ones get used wearing them. 

And drooling mask? Bring spare two change it. Thanks! comment section article whole lot yikes. can't make something nothing employees. sum people required certification (and willing work) add people needed staff existing facilities... do? world talking masks unvaccinated (in area available vaccines)?

If vaccinated give shit masks either, none matters you.

(Not actually ""you"" course).  vaccines tested Delta. think vaccine trials stopped something? They're ongoing. Data suggests still effective. kids generally mild symptoms.  one people consensus since point everyone either test positive protected prior antibodies whether previous infection vaccine? seems. even better fun that. you. Get vaccine Yes appreciate enthusiasm it‚Äôs actually worse that. truth every single American could page regarding vaccination public health. always third world country can‚Äôt keep covid country like Brazil who‚Äôs government absolutely refuses even try. variant cook population eventually spread vaccinated.

That said, I'm wearing mask anymore situations either, unless place I'm tells I'm relatively high traffic area. people certainly risk kind choice. safe, free, effective vaccine taking. point problem.  I‚Äôm assuming thats enough 

There‚Äôs reason rude someone asks good-faith question. Precautions help everyone, person using them. Fauci: Yes, think people vaccinated go area infection, unvaccinated people vulnerable home even people might vaccinated, immunosuppressed, may good response vaccine vaccine, That's reason extra mile care.

**If folks vaccinated, wouldn‚Äôt discussions.** Nice study.

Statistically speaking, spread covid vaccinated person end hospital. 

Stop worry vaccinated people Trader Joe‚Äôs without mask! Start calling companies industries mandate vaccines. Masks aren‚Äôt magic, way. 

And frankly, CDC making right call. wanted extra cautious, would advise everyone still social distance unnecessary activities. Judge risk wear mask stay home, don‚Äôt give fuck. country Virginia, giving people mostly Pziser Moderna. 

UK mostly AZ. Yeah last week tone shifted backwards unsettling way study excess deaths shows insignificant, virtually countries undercounting. Some, like India, undercounting order magnitude. Unlike US Canada, UK hasn‚Äôt given younger people chance get fully vaccinated. Even got first dose soon possible chance get second dose early August, fully vaccinated late August. I'm Canada fully vaccinated, young person UK I'd pretty pissed opportunity fully vaccinated everything opened completely. still know enough long term effects disease, they're gambling long-term health young adults instead giving chance fully protected. ‚ÄúYeah huge numbers young people infected, they‚Äôre young probably won‚Äôt die, cares?‚Äù  John Paul II inspiring Testing rates among fully vaccinated probably low, likely missing lot asymptomatic positives. hypothesis maybe US early stages wave.

My work requires non vaccinated people get tested twice week. Amount time passed probably. Also uk primarily used astra Zeneca less effective mRNA vaccines We're 70% adults they're still talking re-implementing mask mandates.

It's impossible win. I'm fucking furious.  Love see it. I‚Äôm Ontario though numbers getting really good, people starting tire masks. I‚Äôm cool wearing one months yet. It‚Äôs tiny inconvenience public places. good conspiracy theory complete without blaming Jews. article doctored headline posted days back, deleted blatantly false. approval expected within months, think self-imposed deadline January notion came from. vaccine effective, misinformation. Safer fewer even workers workers workers actively kill numbers different ones UK Israel? numbers Virginia amazing, ones UK Israel good, great. could causing discrepancy?   Seriously curious, always Jews? opposite true too. Raw numbers without percentages total population worthless well. vaccine prevent ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù photo from? People strange, I'm sorry.

If someone came in, sick, coughing, etc... I'd make wear mask kick out.

It's disappointing see medicine become political thing USA. :( People want mask mandates re-implemented indoors ""even vaccinated people transmit it"" need able answer two things:

1) indoor mask mandate makes sense go restaurant bar take mask off. different security theatre?

2) threshold getting rid is. People comply unless there's specific end goal. measures cannot indefinite. Last heard winter, Dec/Jan maybe ‚ÄúFully vaccinated people resume activities without wearing mask physically distancing, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace guidance.‚Äù

Sorry, I‚Äôve listening science entire time. I‚Äôm going ignore part CDC‚Äôs advice ‚Äúfeels‚Äù weird. What? Yesterday Chinese, Jews?

Can please decide narrative first, attend rally? UK recording vaccinated hospitalizations dodgey including single doses group. Single dose past two weeks listing.


The problem circular hospitalizations uncontrolled spread. AZ less controlling spread compared MRNA. option get death count control quickly. Compounded lack financial support covid need isolate. get covid fully vaccinated likely ignore minor symptoms. 


The entire issue complicated terrible handling situation. opinion plans let rip burns annual fall / winter crush. 


Don't get wrong 35 got Astrazeneca would still gotten it. got back blood clots serious threat regret it. fully accept need vigilant testing minor cold ""allergies"" sure infecting others. number unvaccinated Virginia going (only 28% adults received least one dose) makes sense percentages eventually change like this.

I'm 16 (17 10 days) went DMV morning get driver's license 40-50% people wearing masks. includes workers numerous hours day. completely shocked many people even bare minimum, especially since new variant contagious, resulting breakthrough infections. parents high risk can't afford get infected all. many people think themselves. 

I'm Delaware too, everything fine mask compliance 100% weeks CDC made announcement. can't tell vaccinated need treat everyone unmasked like threat. lives people care important me, want protect them. means get tested exposure even though I‚Äôm vaccinated, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm going do.

When subs like Mask4all.

When people suggesting vaccinated people wear masks always immunocompromised.

When people suggest others wear masks children can‚Äôt get vaccine even though least vulnerable population statistic. 

When people suggest masks social distancing type end game.

It‚Äôs prevalent sub now.

It sucks others can‚Äôt move immunocompromised. shouldn‚Äôt base societal standards though. escalated quickly. Right, like second turn 12, vaccine suddenly goes unsafe safe. understand cutoff somewhere, blame anyone vaccinating child who's turning 12 months school starts. 37% Mississippi vaccinated, know statistic means. means vaccines UK 90% efficacy preventing serious diseases hospitalizations. means 10% people going hospitals vaccinated. number goes 6% equaling hospitalization rate vaccine would mean vaccine actually nothing, seems idea talking partisan hack actual scientist like  MOTHER GOD WAKE 4+YEAR NIGHTMARE!!!!

Besides, people choosing wear masks vaccines 100% effective, others appreciating that? Absolutely nothing. affect you. all. Period. truly ""don't care people choose wear masks"" made comments.

This reason hostility wearing masks. Religion paved way ignorance take hold, fucked peoples brains point faith whatever want okay. people exiled society yet voting power since congregation votes together. AstraZeneca shown reduce risk hospitalisation 90% two doses, even Delta variant, according data published Public Health England recently month ago.

Dystopian. irony. likely big companies know people going sue vaccine mandates. guaranteed. considering OP (of thread) mentioned company risk averse, they're probably intentionally avoiding risk dragged multi year court case could go supreme court. expensive, depending brand could disastrous.

I'm thinking company like apple Disney, publicity valuable gold. even screenshot email could damage brand among anti vaxxers. Comfy couch snacks ready. Better swim otherwise. export doses, great. not, cost vaccination program fewer takers day. government's work vaccine perhaps one right things did. contract tracing guidelines VA push people get tested vaccinated, wearing mask, person exposed wearing mask. tell kids get tested symptomatic. Prior Alpha Delta variants kids symptoms. counties School years ended Alpha Delta variants made rounds. New School years start, mid August, andvthe day labor day. Kinda. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, health benefit minuscule best. Masks hot uncomfortable, also make communication difficult. 

Is wrong admit wearing mask sucks? it, still wear one required.  US Army preparing mandatory vaccines September.  talking banning businesses operating masks? No-one.

You're fighting straw man argument reason? Oh think hospitalizations percentage overall infections previous waves. muted vaccines percentage lower. never meant imply otherwise. 

It still lot though, cases go roof, even lower percentage ending hospitalizations. Delta much contagious, that's real worry. knows many people effected similar way.

You absolutely certain magnitudes less serious illness/death related COVID - know vaccinating millions people led hospitals overwhelmed - unlike occurred COVID wave (bar far recent one).

No one disputes rare side effects, fact reported led decisions like AZ vaccine used people 30.  Lol, true Several state health departments told STAT repeatedly asked federal government redistribute supply countries, many facing third wave Covid-19 pandemic. Officials Washington rejected requests, citing legal logistical challenges. love üòé Oh they‚Äôre even vaccinated, yikes.

Even left, still weird exercise, nutrition, know-more-health-than-the-masses sort people. Seemingly word. Anyways, let's patiently wait next worse variant. got popcorn ready.  expect unvaccinated people people actually listen mask advisories? clear care anymore, probably much less vaccinated people days.

I'm sorry hear underlying condition might make vulnerable coronavirus, vaccinated not. 

Unfortunately got lot vaccine skeptics country lot pandemic denialism generally. why? afraid needles Wear don‚Äôt wear them, really don‚Äôt care. long run it‚Äôll gets vaccinated. People like charters follow rules. Teachers qualified, pay staff horrible wages, follow state standards, etc wearing mask bother much?  opinion people still posting heard news variants gotten anxious again. people longer care here. people anti-vax posting here, oftentimes concerned enough pandemic generally. Virginia fixing figures.  It‚Äôs something would do, also totally don‚Äôt blame someone it. It‚Äôs crappy situation around. people chose listen donald trump science death warrant already signed book couldn‚Äôt care less happens  say thing you. would become deadly? Well, vaccines ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried health‚Äù people largely selfish. people undoubtedly contributing spread. 

Now? get covid seriously sick, 99% chance didn‚Äôt get vaccine. That‚Äôs you. Covid turned collective problem individual problem. Needs 85 percent Delta. Reading comprehension basic math skills. 

Basically education system country totally fucked. Gf got Sinopharm vaccine today. Can't really find much info it. someone tell may feel like next day two? Send country- better wasting them. I've aunt uncle die.  Sauce please! Thanks ***thaaaat's*** local Chinese food place Pork Fried Rice!  US big, truly national waves, tend regional. Virginia well last summer, seems like well summer too. Virginia particular, numbers telling fall winter.

And course, Virginia's population mostly concentrated areas highest vaccination rates world (e.g. Northern Virginia). Care cite info ‚Äúvaccine longer working‚Äù coming from?? implementing health pass go restaurants public places, need show full vaccination tested negative last 48 hours. also charging tests future make harder people go get tested every 2 days simply avoid vaccination. measures announced, 2 million signed first shot first hours. often using stats include timeframes relatively people fully vaccinated, course, Delta variant pretty misleading. damage done kids school probably much larger risk Covid schools proper precautions areas community spread.

It becoming hard argue Covid affects kids anymore flu RSV, neither school ever shut for. Give us week we'll take back prize. Fair article. doctors acknowledge risk small, say probably won‚Äôt know breakthrough cases (which delta us now).

Long haul syndrome mild infection (not damage done severe infection) already rare. would enough data see virus recently punching vaccines? rarest rare.  remember sub filled certain subset population anti-mask anti-lockdown. constantly said ""I care choose wear one, yadda yadda.""

That clearly lie, based comment. Seems people care quite bit people choosing cautious health pandemic.  seem familiar church I'll defer expert. never set foot church life. FDA needs fully approve vaccines asap mandate them. Enough this. think point convinced hospitalizations par prior waves despite vaccines believe want believe passes us undisputable evidence. point, everyone kind scientific authority (Fauci, Scott G, scientists /r/COVID19), saying link cases hospitalizations largely broken vaccinated. bit misleading universities mandated requiring disclose vaccination status. mandated paper really cases. 100% people fully vaccinated, might NOBODY hospital COVID part, since spreading around. don‚Äôt care. 

They probably want say vaccines don‚Äôt work.

Canada opened prematurely February causing spring wave. Intended trepidation. never sure America.  think get bit crazier everytime try understand ""scary long covid kids"" thing, like, tens millions kids US alone get infected 6-8 months ago? know lot still suffering covid?  Speak yourself...... Getting vaccinated would preferable. someone doesn't, get immunity (or death) infection. won‚Äôt open new variants still infect vaccinated people. would collapse zero COVID promise enrage citizens. It‚Äôs happening.

Literally delusion think would ‚Äúslowly open up‚Äù Olympics Beijing well.  Pun intended, hope says. provides marginal extra protection much think. Bringing mask mandate back great way get people say well get vaccinated still wear mask wont get vaccinated, whats point? Jews affect Stanley Kubrick faking moon landing? Can‚Äôt speak whole county town, two weeks restrictions lifted saw mostly masks stores. work, people problem masking. Overall though, must great since high transmission rate right now. sure since mandate since put effect Saturday.  cares? Fuck em. I'm tired country letting bar set worst us. Five six years ago idea antisemitism seemed quaint. Im pro vaccine get - think lot parents rightfully concerned vaccine effects kids covid poses low risk them. I‚Äôm saying wouldn‚Äôt vaccinate kid saying going much cautious parents there. They're mutually exclusive. Masks mandates temporary control increasing spread.

Mandatory vaccines popping many institutions countries vaccine access, probably popular gets full FDA approval. seven months past.

Less actually. mid-February 30% Israel's population fully vaccinated, means immunity kick around late February. even 5 months. vaccine even last long would probably worst vaccine ever history, would subpar even flu vaccine standards (at least last whole winter season usually). I'm gonna stay skeptical proven wrong. make mistake, China poor, US funding, occurred, would never sole funding even important funding source.

US funding lab via NIH helps ensure US least access researchers lab work that's funded (because joint research)

Cut funding, China - quite reasonably - shut US access lab.

And elected political heros whine cry China's increased lack transparency inability NIH determine what's happening lab. Fully vaccinated reduces risk. still get covid. 

Vaccination + social distancing + mitigation efforts working home helps ending pandemic. Dropping mask mandate ultimately punished vaccinated, breakthrough cases occur, there's literally public indoor location that's safe. least everyone wearing masks pre-vax, guaranteed level safety. free all, even getting groceries fraught proposition.  Probably. manufacturers public health agencies still want numbers show case approve anything children. you‚Äôve chance get vaccine haven‚Äôt, rest us responsible virus longer responsible safety.  sympathetic racial issues, even addressed recent uptick Asian hate crimes.  hope stops giving money church. 

Why go people berate her. 

Clearly care demagogue that's longer office god claim worship says take care body given you.  Despite PBS headline, actually discuss children all. low-vax places, gaf they're living normally too. Impossible. parents voted Trump double vaccinated. mom keen get booster offered too. 


Both them, especially Dad remember society pre-vaccinations. Dad 85 remembers polio, people manner parasites viruses.  No, answered saying wait FDA approves medicine government *forces everyone* get it. anything, mandate vaccine. mask mandates gonna piss people already got vaccinated. isn‚Äôt even real solution. problem percentage population without immunity never got vaccinated. issue since Covid spreading throughout world. Even mask mandate ends lowers cases acceptable levels, we‚Äôll still population country without immunity global virus. problem we‚Äôre going keep encountering without increased vaccination. 

We need legally mandated vaccines, mask mandate. makes much scientific sense. get can‚Äôt visually see someone vaccinated can‚Äôt determine whether care pandemic like people wear mask, really matter compared policies quantifiably bring us better place? I'm vaxxed living like 2019. Traveled two different major cities month. Going restaurants, bars, shows, museums. Covid gonna endemic disease I'm gonna exposed life. Vaccine reduces risk acceptable level. mask mandates going solve anything ever virus. R0 potentially 4x higher original virus. vaccine mandates.  kids? vaccinated people start turning refusing comply. omg  Agreed.  

Tremendous, great, wonderful would make quote seem like words. Something simple going work school shouldn‚Äôt classified ‚Äúhigh risk things‚Äù could easily expose someone covid. vaccine fact shield virus. understand vaccine does? 100% mean work all. I'm impressed. know well getting vaccine. Nice job UK! completely misunderstood point.

I meant ""You still die vaccinated"" stupid phrase ""You still die seatbelt on"". It‚Äôs likely accurate samples respective country looking at. pretty much methodology Israel can‚Äôt know sample viewing, UK seems tracking population representative sample weekly stats.

I don‚Äôt know even compare Israel UK ‚Äúdata‚Äù yet, one context data points robust comprehensive report. general population ""generally"" okay vaccine, mean take steps mitigate damage. I'm sorry Grandma deal garbage humans, deserves better that.  UK Canada still restrictions place patchwork fashion. 

The UK (had) basically restrictions except masks indoors barely anyone could bothered wearing UK population-level immunity infection

Unlikely. Israel cases/population also test historically less, plus population younger, anything I'd expect Israel natural immunity. vaccinated wearing mask. fact better.

Absolutely. one denying Wearing mask top vaccinated actually provide much protection. someone vaccinated doesnt wear mask completely safe.

That's article says /u/SelfHatingPhillyFan posted example experts sharing point view. Fuck kind data mining social control. Tremendous I‚Äôm crazy person household. üò¨ Maastricht person giving vaccine cross check passport something guess system try stopping fraud. would reduce gun violence, increase vaccination rates. think probably function FDA approval. tech companies collude lot things behind scene punished it, think exception vaccine mandates. Basically (the big ones) need mandate prevent poaching.    think shot's efficacy wanes time. got second dose back March used fake ID college get single follow-up dosage twice since then. Better safe sorry. Plus travel unvaccinated infected kids coming back. Many Israelis unfortunately fully quarantine.

Eran Segal, scientist Weizmann Institute advisor government, said Israel herd immunity Delta. Follow @sailorrooscout Twitter. one scientists worked development Moderna vaccine continues post trends vaccine coverage Covid news Twitter. super insightful. think enjoying oneself means putting others risk, part problem.  expect do? Lie say delta contagious alpha? OP even arguing virus dangerous delta serious...just vaccines work extremely well people get wear masks. However, people claim pro-vaccine really desperate argue vaccines actually work. sounds expensive.  That‚Äôs super interesting never knew it‚Äôs past. TLC ‚Äú600 lb life‚Äù ‚Äú90 day fianc√©e‚Äù. people learning besides bad habits lol Wouldn‚Äôt also make people spend money? Ok everyone! Go get covid time cuz guys says so. I‚Äôm gonna go get immediately. Thank advice. Problem solved tomorrow.   Don‚Äôt sure. lot young, smart, educated people think vaccine troublesome covid, especially since heart inflammation (Pfizer, Moderna) blood clots (JJ) information came out. 

There anti vaccine people across entire political spectrum too. them?  stats include everyone, vaccinated not.

The vaccines never claimed 100 per cent effective stopping people catching coronavirus (although make big dent). strength reducing chances someone becoming seriously ill dying, important thing, certainly UK emphasis much eradicating covid entirely (likely impossible) ensuring overwhelm health service. 

On note, yesterday Chief Scientific Advisor confirmed 60 per cent hospitalisations covid currently unvaccinated people, showing vaccines job. see reason get high eventually. pretty high vaccines like MMR. take time institutions demanding it. FOS News... Full SH\*\*\* News! really good step. naturally something Tennessee NEVER do. I‚Äôm even fucking American hate Rand Paul. Goodie That‚Äôs, still, headline says.  hand, plenty unvax people infected didn‚Äôt bother get tested too, didn‚Äôt get sick enough. Half covid infected don‚Äôt get sick show symptoms, light symptoms. you‚Äôre favor mask usage, yet problem restaurants vacation spots open?

You realize masks restaurants 100% pointless right? logic requires believe likely get covid 30 second walk bathroom wear mask, rather sitting maskless table two hours. SEC schools south, state governments don‚Äôt seem care vaccinations. think Florida even passing laws prohibit schools requiring vaccines. least may push vaccinate more. won‚Äôt care students get sick die, they‚Äôll anything forfeit football game. right point people didnt lie vaccination status would safe unmasked. Imposing vaccine mandate would better mask mandate. Reminds civet pooped coffee - civet animals would pick eat tastiest coffee beans pooped beans would collected make hipster coffee...

um...I shit not! Could be? what? that's group need protect can't imagine come pass maybe. Thank you! Final boss one sticks groceries Sure does. Probably gotten maybe shouldn't. got lots good reasons to. Good luck that. positive outlook see American, hope negatively happens UK help fight stupidity US. especially worried parent back school plans. Ohio requiring masks even 12 unvaccinated group. youngest remote learning that‚Äôs case seeing able fully vaccinated late December January here. Maybe FDA approved force everyone get it.

As long vaccinated, big risk. Maybe walk section that's crowded.  See link  people caught infected yet fully vaccinated. seem think whole country either vaccinated infected -- that's case. still lots vulnerable hosts there. Michael Osterholm said yesterday 1 5 kids infected delta variant get long covid. 

The whole ""kids fine"" narrative going change quick school starts fall. Still better LA, talking nyc New York fully vaccinated teens grocery Atlanta yesterday. woman walks mask says ‚ÄúWe back masks, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù said, ‚ÄúWe never stopped‚Äù Cope.

You clearly seem know copy-paste button, unfortunately seem able read.

Question. vaccinated politicians testing covid despite CDC guidelines say vaccinated people don‚Äôt need worry exposed covid positive people?

Our vaccinated Vice President meeting vaccinated politicians tested positive following days. tested covid. Why? CDC saying vaccinated don‚Äôt need tested even exposed covid positive people.

And answer two fold. First, plenty important social distancing rules ended exactly time. city dropped reduced capacity bars restaurants time. People started big parties. social distancing ended. masks. 

Second, delta variant rose prominence. UK gov report vaccine effectiveness surveillance mind technical language.  35% still [does math] better 0%, plus variants still need protection from.

Israel also people vaccinated longer waning media outlets? booster shot tweaked covers delta well? majority cases 30s though, group time mostly yet first dose. Cases falling age groups, highest (unvaccinated) teens. Unfortnutaly vaccine regulator decided vaccinate teens, see happens.  deleted re-posted it: places story: used vaccinate kids school return so. People take virus back though unvaccinated kids vaccinated-but-still-vulnerable elderly family members. cases still high work home productive, wait numbers go returning office? There‚Äôs winning point. Get vaxxed get Covid. either case, subsequent infection likely won‚Äôt significant. Compelling argument, risk infection spinal tap system due micro processing tracker mind control unit installed vaccine?? We'll lucky *only* scream. Far many see excuse something serious &amp; escalate. restrict data certain dates. Here's data June 20th July 9th:

breakthrough hospitalizations: 9, total hospitalizations: 196

breakthrough death: 1, total deaths: 15

really good numbers things considered Omega¬≥  Damn people. Better stock masks again. Maybe countries don‚Äôt access like us US? even supposed react new deaths announced every day past 16 months? callous, grim part reality we're living in. Cheaper closing whole office due outbreak Cases rising US overall, think taken delta longer get spread widely. According rumors messed everything leaving mess new government misspoke, also think given shots every person going made required.

The abysmal vaccination rates general absolutely due entitlement, including sense entitled yell opinion loud actual facts regard fallout. Also Karen‚Äôs throwing tantrums protesting streets couldn‚Äôt get nails done, people dying around them. result loud people also lot others don‚Äôt know getting wrong info, don‚Äôt know news sources bullshit propaganda, don‚Äôt realize echo chamber, make decisions based nonsense thinking it‚Äôs informed decision. yes blame Alex Jones situation lot blame somebody‚Äôs grandma would never knowingly hurt fly lived life news get trustworthy info news says everybody else lying going die believe them.

I apply well. kid lives bubble filled people, including parents loves trusts supposed experts field, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs choice personally don‚Äôt trust it‚Äù. grandma gets blame she‚Äôs still adult making decisions it‚Äôs kid literally groomed moment adults telling what‚Äôs right. Canada behind Israel soon started mass 2nd doses overrun delta yet.

If get overrun delta, may start seeing reduced efficacy got 2 shots 6+ months ago would elderly 

They need release better data though significant mutations spike protein Delta Alpha variants.

Lol live NJ.

A lot people live just... compliant anything... put nicely.

I vaccinated.

If mandate masks again, I'm in.

WEARING MASK BIG DEAL...FFS.

I feel like punishment all.

I'd like crush thing push morons wear masks want before, well it.

There's logistical nightmare everyone fully vaccinated get covid. literally people used working home want go back office. evidence claim viruses reached ""optimal"" form mutation would make worse transmission? Thank you, really good news.  Indian, less confirm this. bodies floating ganga, almost thousands cremated banks due rise cost wood many labelled non Covid deaths. already excess death reports coming 2-3 states show almost 10-20x undercounting. Sadly none ever come mainstream media outlets totally bought bu govt. Long haul syndrome mild infection uncommon Wait, what? telling i'm social media *right now???* GOOD  Hope get better!    Yasssss. needs widely spread I'm trying say there's lot progress tolerance Jewish people, there's still lot hatred, antisemitism widely denounced today. wonder USA ever achieve this. Happy Scotland, depressed us stuck USA. aren‚Äôt UK friends getting vaccinated? done make sure EVERY British citizen gets jab? good thing? Sorry, already require them. meant continuing fall session  example, suppose bunch vaccinated test subjects inject certain amount virus test two days later infection. compare unvaccinated test subjects given dose also measured infection two days later. viral dose high enough efficacy vaccine zero everyone groups test positive. Therefore, efficacy infection function level exposure.

The description given website sufficient convey general idea people whose eyes glaze thought computing percentage. Lots people way. return office complex potentially costly maneuver. company spent lot time effort planning out, included plans potential upticks virus cases potential send everyone home again. Last March chaos sent everyone home.

For large companies like Apple even logistical productivity nightmare.  vaccinated still wear masks stores. 

My calculation still wearing masks stores simple one. What's cost wearing mask? Zero since already masks perfectly comfortable wearing one 30 minutes. 

What's benefit wearing mask? Low since vaccinated, non-zero since vaccine 100% effective prevent infections. Getting sick sucks, I'd prefer get sick all. 

So calculation simple, non-zero benefits zero cost. wear mask? wear masks make feel superior people. can't control people worry it. wear masks myself. going do? Seeing it‚Äôs going fully vaccinated people coming in, whatever happens delta south impact date. include caveat statement, case.  Ooo okay. known day become carrier/transmitter virus ?  Meanwhile Philippines shortage vaccines manpower, people line lining 8 hours get vaccinated. There's enough go around. article makes seem fairly Terrible idea refer mask mandates threat punishment, especially NJ people went got vaccine.

Nobody vaccinated yet going go bc threatens bring back mask mandate. Haha thumbnail One, stepfather-in-law, quite ill already got pretty much chance. MIL caught asymptomatic, quite relief since 90. live crazy (or immunocompromised children) people no. already I'm upset. work require office setting. Numbers also show productive office...  ‚ÄúHowever, people vaccinated early stage vaccine drive appear age 65 findings may reflect vaccine's efficacy among age groups.‚Äù

So it‚Äôs looking like elderly immune compromised ones fairing well. think America take look boosters demographics ASAP. Florida data Worldometer recently?  Yup. They'll claim Fox News ""too liberal.""  early talk exit strategy.

China vaccination coverage 52%, according Bloomberg tracker.  1) That's enough herd immunity.  2) even though China similar vaccination rate US, much lower infection (i.e. much lower natural immunity). guess China needs another 20+% vaccination number match US community immunity 3) big difference immunization rate big city village. cities 90+% coverage lot villages much lower number.

China change zero covid strategy 80 85% population full vaccines. take least end year. slowly open that. agree that, honestly even cases general without context pretty useless point, brings us back VA tracker pretty awesome. power electrical engineers working designing megawatt level tranformers, making sure grid frequency voltage don‚Äôt shift. linesmen couldn‚Äôt hope fix cable.

I'm vaccinated could still pick virus transfer somebody? I‚Äôm one thinks that‚Äôs reason you‚Äôve phrased like considering karma comment. Maybe edit rephrase, can‚Äôt see anything else.

In middle ages Christianity forbade people loan money, call banking today. Jewish people restrictions, quite often became involved financial businesses.

Problem that's popular occupation have. That's one ways anti-semitism started.

It also help Jewish people basically foreigners where-ever went. tended look slightly different, language, religion customs.

And yes Christianity found easy scapegoat Jewish people. Mask mandates probably useless Delta it‚Äôs contagious everyone gonna get vaccinated. definitely vaccinate 12's approved yet. would also like point view kids school regardless vaccination status opinion official guidance CDC. zero COVID strategy possible many countries they're impoverished hold extended lockdowns would necessary completely eliminate virus. example, two main reasons cited Peru's attempted lockdown disaster 62% households access banking 40% lack refrigerator meant government easily provide financial assistance people get stay home people go food frequently. Even first world countries attempt zero COVID strategy, they're still going dealing endless stream cases poor areas lack resources infrastructure lockdown. Locally hospitals started requiring Covid vaccine. quite literally protests street state capital requiring hospital workers. think figured wasn‚Äôt government capital protests apparently yesterday morons blocked roads near hospitals protesting. apparently completely neglected effect blocking roads ambulances use get ER‚Ä¶ Exactly :) Since dad fully vaccinated, statistic want look percentage hospitalisations within vaccinated population since relevant statistic , ratio vaccinated unvaccinated hospitalisations presented thread. I‚Äôm home moment it‚Äôs difficult find data phone, I‚Äôll try update better idea number soon can, assuringly it‚Äôs small percentage hospitalised, even smaller percentage admitted ITU extraordinarily smaller percentage demised within fully vaccinated population. obviously say there‚Äôs reason careful; example fully vaccinated young, still wear mask can, keep distance use hand sanitiser/wash hands frequently. What‚Äôs promising top current vaccine effectiveness, boosters provided within months they‚Äôre working adjusting future vaccines prevalent variants even protection still provided dad :) areas may able avoid fall surge high enough vaccination rate. 

NJ unique position, densely populated state US. result many people close together, may need higher vaccination rate states really avoid surge, even though NJ fairly well compared many states vaccination rate. Yeah, let‚Äôs! could go wrong?   Great Scot! compliance LA since new mandate? TLC ""The Learning Channel"" back day funded NASA.

There‚Äôs big difference critiquing Chinese handling virus, wasn‚Äôt even bad we‚Äôre fair standards (people expect unreasonable standards conclude China bad), chanting something like ‚Äúthe government China behind pandemic‚Äù lot assholes do, little purpose, definitely motivated furthers racism.  impressive. Sadly country (Germany) never reach that. Yes, Wales already reached 90% England close behind. know what's going Northern Ireland letting team 83% adults vaccinated really disheartening living Florida time. happy mask usage guidance vaccinated people wear masks came every store dropped mask policy. Now, might see one two people wearing masks grocery stores. vaccination rate nowhere near needs be.

My sister law doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated she‚Äôs heavily pregnant doesn‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs enough research pregnant people regarding vaccines. understand that, honestly, it‚Äôs hard you‚Äôre responsible another life something happen you‚Äôd always wonder something did. she‚Äôs large parties specifically going places don‚Äôt require masks! go certain popular covid conspiracy subreddit you‚Äôll see people saying vaccine killing people actual covid. disconnect reality insane. always inevitable. vaccinated like getting cold, usually pretty mild one. think people fail realize case numbers go mean pandemic bad vaccines. Case numbers raw data. reflect severity, hospitalizations, deaths. play aren‚Äôt numbers extremely skewed talking unvaccinated? Like course ages 50 least vaccinated that‚Äôs who‚Äôs going fill hospitals. put analogy, vaccine makes defending 10 swords 9 shields. mutation includes higher total surface spike proteins would make vaccine defending 15 swords 9 shields. virus get deadly, gets past vaccinations we're back old spot November 2020. Okie dokes, I'm discrediting we're going never questioned excess deaths caused Covid. once.

Everybody's nerves must tatters they've taken way. day long. really care someone tested positive asymptomatic barely viral load. meant vaccine worked.    Yes, really vaccinated (extremely large, almost 30% 18) underage population approved yet. many cases around world, reported infections fraction actual infections. hand, I'm sure testing everyone involved assiduously. 71 likely tip iceberg, know big berg yet.

Feel bad athletes. going sidelined events. work crapper.  I've returned social activities enjoy (dining out, hanging vaccinated friends, etc) without mask, definitely still wear one shopping like. hate wearing also really liked getting sick past 1.5yr, even covid related. well said, man. well functioning society product participants. hope altruism makes come back society, unity way beat pandemic. us still waiting first... still come. preface get trouble immediately following story woman required get vaccine bad. efficacy found? don't. crisis measured intelligence society there's solid third us literally can't even paid take life-saving miracle vaccine they're enthralled bullshit peddlers dank memes. illusion collective ability come together time crisis rudely shattered. 70% us blunder way right answer. rest us can't find asses hands flashlight. sad state affairs. Didn‚Äôt know actually people still believe masks don‚Äôt protect you. lived rock past months countless studies?

Combine political figures constantly spewing bullshit, who‚Äôs really fault? actually held accountable? right thing, I'm talking point saying individual problem. even though individuals making wrong choices willing spreading it, actions still going affect us whole. 

We'll still pick collectively group move forward. US, there's still young kids can't get vaccinated. Around world countries still little access vaccines.

We're going dealing increased premiums Healthcare costs industry recouping financial losses well. can't shipped elsewhere due logistical issues, might well offer voluntary 3rd dose people.

Getting numbers lower school starts also crucial actually school year. know everyone fully vaccinated. Even 100% effective, unfortunately. Big companies make business decisions like lightly. 

This asking 15 people laptops drive office tomorrow. ""Variant mutation JOKE JIM. Millions people die every year""  10 % 70 % larger 20% 30%.   Nike's shoes finally going get expensive.  works fine region gets locked down. relatives experienced regional lock early year, pleasant, especially small business owners. Same-ish friends LA. Delta variant still back minds, still acknowledge risk us relatively minimal (young vaccinated). still masked work, despite order saying could go without (until past weekend least). Seems that‚Äôs source lot COVID information lately...  religion misogynistic too. also poland secular state Again, seems going way travel. do, seem issue governments literal gatekeepers respective borders comes protecting citizens others travelling country unvaccinated.

So reasonable course action enact measures borders reasonable within?

I get point slippery slope, employer rights regarding this? ran restaurant would want ensure safety myself, employees patrons requiring this. Historically, medical conditions considered paramount regards individual's privacy, consider someone underlying medical condition afforded right privacy. change would substantially increase amount staff required vaccination site.

The way worked one mega vaccination sites Amsterdam:

1. Person door checks wearing mask, asks right paperwork appointment. Directs queue.
2. brief wait, go desk check ID health questionnaire order appointment day.
3. directed different queue based vaccine getting, medical indication.
4. head queue, staffer directs one dozen open desks.
5. person final desk takes BSN (social security number) looks computer. check id confirm name date birth. review health questionnaire. everything good, print vaccination card, stamp yellow book one, mark computer vaccinated. direct injection area.
6. walk first open injection booth hand vaccination card nurse. ask confirm name date birth, give injection.
7. go area bunch chairs set wait 15 minutes make sure allergic reaction, leave.

If give vaccination card injection, they'd need another queue another whole row staffed desks (or could considerably fewer vaccinations per day staff level).

In configuration, first desk, they'd check id eligibility vaccine. get vaccine. go second desk, they'd put info computer print card register vaccination. Meanwhile, they'd police new queue make sure one slipped getting vaccine getting registered computer.

If large number people trying get vaccine proof without getting vaccine, might make sense use before-and-after system checks (in computer science, call ""two-phase commit""). pretty rare thing, makes far sense, logistically economically, way they've already set up, keep eye fraudsters, cancel vaccine registration fact.

Think Starbucks things. take order, start making drink, get queue pay. drink done, call name. happens can't pay? toss drink leave thirsty. take payment first make drink? slows things down, almost one orders something can't/won't pay it.  already see writing wall killing voters. Even Hannity apparently telling people get vaccinated now. Bring back masks. time stop pretending Covid control.  One thing consider numbers NJ cases coming from. According bulletins county health department we‚Äôve getting work new cases currently clustered urban areas (Newark, Camden) shore counties incredibly busy year. suburban rural parts state seeing much slower growth. 

Will change fall? Probably moment NJ okay compared states similar population size. Damn. freaking bloodbath... lot human misery.

Terrible.   Simply comparing past peaks today's numbers cases, hospitalizations, death.

It's crude, far off. try ‚Äúcitation‚Äù somewhere deep within ass pulled from. vaccine shown effective variants thus far.  I'm saying top 100% re-infections possible. measure necessarily break groups fully infected, there's still difference number infections group well long took group fully infected. Clickbait last time France recorded 18,000 new daily infections May 13,

[Cases - Well, exposure virus inevitable. vaccinated people never feel significant symptoms ever know infected subject routine testing.  levels serious adverse events we're seeing covid vaccines higher we'd tolerate non-pandemic context

Source this? responding comments never made, I'll leave talk while. New Zealand woefully behind vaccine rollout though?    Almost 90% people 18+ UK first shot. problem never uptake. using 95% efficacy example explain concept efficacy. yeah know theory, later changed ‚Äòcultural marxists‚Äô. work ‚Äöhalf‚Äò ‚Äöhalf‚Äò?  Man, stats non-poke poke-poke crazy. Hopefully it'll help.

So vaccinated people concerned personal safety? Probably not, going get safer COVID-19 likely remain endemic. Unvaccinated folks immunocompromised individuals take precautions feel safe them. Risk kids low, parents use best judgement risk assessment advice medical professionals. Car crashes also hurt kids. going stop driving?

Edit: also fun fact - blood vessel damage inflammation also occurs regular flu. funny many people finally understanding fevers sicknesses body attribute 'damage' COVID. much true, especially Delta age well.

Most experts believe India‚Äôs official toll 414,000 dead vast undercount, government dismissed concerns exaggerated misleading. 
 
The report released Tuesday estimated excess deaths ‚Äî gap recorded would expected ‚Äî 3.4 million 4.7 million since pandemic began last month. said accurate figure may ‚Äúprove elusive,‚Äù true death toll ‚Äúis likely order magnitude greater official count.‚Äù 
 
The report published Arvind Subramanian, Indian government‚Äôs former chief economic adviser, two researchers Center Global Development, nonprofit think tank based Washington, Harvard University. 
 
It said count could missed deaths occurred overwhelmed hospitals health care disrupted, particularly devastating virus surge earlier year. 
 
‚ÄúTrue deaths likely several millions hundreds thousands, making arguably India‚Äôs worst human tragedy since Partition independence,‚Äù report said. 
 
The Partition British-ruled Indian subcontinent independent India Pakistan 1947 led killing 1 million people gangs Hindus Muslims slaughtered other. 
 
The report India‚Äôs virus toll used three calculation methods: data civil registration system records births deaths across seven states, blood tests showing prevalence virus India alongside global COVID-19 fatality rates, economic survey nearly 900,000 people done three times year. 
 
Researchers cautioned method weaknesses, economic survey omitting causes death. 
 
Instead, researchers looked deaths causes compared data mortality previous years ‚Äî method widely considered accurate metric. 
 
Researchers also cautioned virus prevalence COVID-19 deaths seven states studied may translate India, since virus could spread urban versus rural states since health care quality varies greatly around India. 
 
Other nations also believed undercounted deaths pandemic. India thought greater gap due world‚Äôs second-highest population 1.4 billion deaths recorded even pandemic.

This going now. Scott talking months. Pfizer already filed one. thinking this. covid fake! /s educated person basic grasp statistics thinks that, pseudo intellectuals reddit social media repeat others misinformation. mean, public transit still requires masks from. honestly, don‚Äôt think mandating masks grocery store Target going mitigate much.

Luckily vaccines work. Alma matter Philly too, heard pushback many events one zero participants within week? said 10% doubling every two weeks. late May/early June. Sounds like right. Wow, flashback (not back 25 years). Getting BCG jag punching arm PE :) wonder many variants take get Zeta Hey , smokers. unvaccinated cut profits, going make changes. third arm thing stupidest shit I've seen while. company already ""returned office"".

By that, mean they're letting people work office. poked head briefly badge old side I'd gotten email saying, ""hey, RIFD chip badge going wear soon, come get new one"", found proverbial ghost town: maybe 6 people whole building janitors there.

Is true? Sounds kind fishy me, would've factored variants vaccine production. ""What, even willing die preventable disease us??"" Awesome! Every state needs this, well CDC. Let liars right dumb followers see anti-vaccine/anti-mask rhetoric worked them. elderly start getting 2nd shots Ontario?

That‚Äôll trick This

Over 99% covid deaths unvaccinated people. That's debate opinion. I'm starting see traces pattern here. Israel's data keeps diverting everyone else's, wonder methodology influence this. NYT showing percentage **all** people UK including people 18 that's number lower. UK gov't numbers (88% first, 68.8% second) counts people 18+.  Never late change mind. Good job. make good point think necessarily parallel. pick comments see one example jobs, entertainment venues, etc requiring test unvaccinated vaccinated. totally reasonable policy, mean asymptomatic unvaxxed people going get tested far often asymptomatic vaxxed people. So, numbers little higher.

And probably happens voluntarily too. Someone without vaccination might get test make sure spreading unintentionally, help someone would like spend time feel comfortable Schools shut plenty Swine Flu pandemic, albeit temporary basis still. think UK Israel proved vaccine isn‚Äôt exit strategy. exit strategy survival. is, keeping new cases zero waiting end pandemic countries. test accuracy package.

Keep us posted. \*hope\* post-vaccination long covid rare maybe less severe (ie, little fatigue instead disabling fatigue, etc). many healthcare workers vaccinated months, regularly exposed covid working age women (since working age women vulnerable long covid). long covid vaccination common long covid without vaccination, would expect instead seeing one story vaccinated nurse long covid, we'd seeing \*lot\* stories vaccinated healthcare workers long covid. mean, obviously, data, promising \*not\* seeing stories. Agreed. 
Including immunocompromised children. vaccinated person putting mask back either. I‚Äôm teacher, sounds like district Oklahoma. got heckled TEACHERS wearing mask last year. almost quit came back assured certain precautions (that eventually abandoned). anyone provide hard numbers chances getting long covid even fully vaccinated? Absolutely, led thoughts original question regarding breakthrough cases various outcomes enough time exposure given one may probably still get covid post-vaccination. They're likely know many sick dying.

I remember channels reporting lives lost, seems stopped months ago. UK conducting numerous studies?  Army talking like expect approval September  Like change anyone's mind. Vaccines never stockpiled states. stayed Pfizer Moderna freezers They‚Äôre saying January granted expedited approval six month deadline normally, think September. based things military said around 4 months submission they‚Äôll six months stability data started vaccinations. someone Pfizer 10% chance developing severe illness, 60% increased chance would increase 16%. looking decrease 90% even isolate heavily vaccinated north poorly vaccinated regions get political ten months Trump pandemic response, would really risk Republican elected state pandemic mask mandate sooner? said tweet MO 50% vaccine rate, true?

‚ÄúThat job,‚Äù Kilmeade said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs job protect anybody.‚Äù


Holy shit, lol. What's role military, again? Yeah, VA tracker going godsend. Really wish PA (where am) would something similar, VA close enough similar enough I‚Äôll take it. world universal masking going push cases much bars, restaurants, clubs open 100%. bizarre projection know published. Booster shots required anyway. could modified effective new variants. need new shots flu virus variants too. employer (google) still Sept 1 RTO people still coming office optionally now.  opted Astrazeneca hopefully month.  people's world view going flip upside news. bed 4 days cold &amp; flu-like symptoms. started feel better that, lingering cough, shortness breath, tiredness still 2 weeks later. Definitely end world, I‚Äôm thankful ‚Äúmild.‚Äù Hopefully vaccine played part that. ""Full vaccination appears significantly protective partial vaccination prior infection, tested vaccines showed diminished effectiveness Delta, compared versions virus."" we've come stage tonight,

To show you! üé∂ efficacy vaccines, i'd think infections without vaccines pose much greater risk COVID-19 vaccinated individuals. ""save lives"" statements make sense me, considering small portion population vaccinated risk COVID-19 complications. Anti Vaxers scum feel bad Japan, nearly everyone involved, going good fun time Olympics, like be, whilst legacy Olympics often debated, good legacy here.

However world still pandemic, cant expect put big events like these, expect go without hitch, it. Plus every person dies covid, many die every day causes. fretting too?

I need know many people died covid last week know get vaccinated. Whoa....Delta much everything, going wild fall semester them. put TV's behind treadmills, OAN would effective motivator. Welcome biotech. There's lots really cool promising technology fails many reasons - funding, lack partnering, scalability, differences get vivo (animals humans).  Yeah, areas need mask already weren‚Äôt. Missouri never mask mandate bet counties won‚Äôt implement again. KC Saint Louis don‚Äôt really need mandate. Covid patients KC hospital rural parts Missouri none KC. district CA I've heard statewide, exposed 15 minutes within 6 feet, stay home ten days get PCR test school negative, stay. positive, 10 days quarantine, going sports activities school. Masks indoors only, optional outside. know Moderna Pfizer coming require different doses attain resistance, even tracking false single dose rollout? Science told us %50 best single dose. constitute resistant population consideration openings herd immunity etc. That's good idea. hospitalization icu status, too. Putting career public safety. truly politician. Hope get appointment soon! Gonna gerrymander harder! state stopped months ago, get twice weekly updates   level protection get first shot alone. say fell sick, long? reality get vaccinated every year. treat like it‚Äôs dangerous flu. get flu shot every year, get COVID shot every year.

To understanding COVID stay forever. vaccines effective alpha/delta.  thought issue come different conclusion did, that's all.

Nope. Im expert field. Theyre contrarian imbeciles like scream ""that proven safety countermeasure would never work here!!!!"" Well enough J&amp;J go around, registered HSE. kind way prevent getting disease

Damn 98%. Huh, number wildly matches effectiveness phizer vaccine. Gee, woulda thought! real way enforce mask mandates first place. remember hearing fines early on, handful actually given out.

Anyways, they're going beg bring back mandate. high school level philosophy class ""thought experiment"" feel immune compromised people need rely herd immunity it‚Äôs clearly coming anytime soon.   care others. anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt care others.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Put way, viruses child likely encounter, much likely put hospital probably never even consider eg. RSV

Each year United States, RSV leads, average, approximately 58,000 hospitalizations among children younger 5 years old. year half, Covid hospitalized far fewer this. 25 year old‚Ä¶damn high age? üò≥ month two late UK 4-5 months late India. Unless wearing respirator, masks protect others, yourself. 

The problem CDC decision was, admission, data whatsoever time vaccinated people spread variants wild type. know vaccinated people **can** spread dominant variants US mask indoors avoid infecting children unvaccinated.

Lambda (the variant burning Peru Chile) Texas (right one patient Houston), well understood delta. might somewhat vaccine resistant, least Chinese vaccine given South America.

I think 6 months optimistic hope end right.  That's unlikely, particularly accounting future proofing.

As low estimate, delta needs 85% vaccination rates within population get herd immunity. practice higher vaccination prevent infection, drop transmission rates people get infected much. younger people even higher R number higher due contacts. want even higher account new variants.

The lower age groups, really 50, lagging behind vaccination rates despite easy access doses. 18-29 alone another couple million first doses go hit herd immunity within respective age ranges, current rate would two months first doses capacity week.

How statistic get media coverage? already subject multiple documentaries, books, studies, etc. like wondering problem many areas whole time staring right face. 80% adult population Israel vaccinated. sure giving 18 yet. think recent outbreak linked unvaccinated school children.  Yep - states dont supply numbers allow bad apples spread false news based ""totally true"" social media posts theres way combat information.   Lucky you. great spot. parents COVID got vaccine later.

Malaysia much cases deaths time past, US 90% lower time high due vaccine figure, person willfully unvaccinated time reason be, decided stance. shy wearing mask? you‚Äôre independent enough make decisions, hide? (Not directing ‚Äú you‚Äù OP). also possible virus mutate less dangerous version Covid well. Alongside vaccination rates increasing, ideal scenario I'm hoping for. Seems one remembers ""unprecedented"" means. hard time sympathetic time around anti-vax folks, they‚Äôve months right thing, also serve whole bunch immunocompromised people community. 20% breakthrough rate means us *did* right thing whole time put back spot knowing contagion rate, regardless whether die not. even though throw hands whole Personal Responsibility thing, still don‚Äôt want see people get sick and/or die.

So monocytes poking dying covid-infected cells get reaction immune system see finish off?

I'm confused. possible implement vaccine passes, get push back that, friends NJ mentioned vaccine app NJ commissioned use terrible. July data - 6 Breakthrough hospitalizations 47 Breakthrough cases. 1:8, that's really high ratio. ratio unvaccinated 1:26 (80:2130).

Either 1) missing whole lot breakthrough cases, way 3x assertion vaccines protect severe outcomes. 2) develop, outcome actually way severe Let‚Äôs go!! Lambda variant detected Texas. might effective evading vaccines (too soon tell yet, hopefully not). bet Delta burning unvaccinated covid yet. Hopefully Lambda become problem like Peru Chile close woods yet. anecdotal, 4 friends, fully vaccinated, caught Covid gathering 13 another person unvaccinated. 10 13 fully vaccinated antibodies earlier Infections.

The unvaccinated person believed contact tracing ""patient zero"" gathering recent antibodies December 2020, negative PCR days gathering, negative rapid test day of. days gathering person begin testing positive, symptoms all.

Of 4 caught it, 3 experienced shortness breath, coughing, brain fog, fatigue, fevers. 2 passed onto spouses 1 infant.

The 2 unvaccinated people gathering wore masks whole time distanced catch it.

For anyone immunosuppressive drugs immune compromised, 2 positives immune compromised. 1 better far monoclonal antibodies, rough go trying get antibodies.

Obviously big conclusions drawn specific event situation anyone anticipated CDC communicating lately. Yes, comes avoided increase deaths hospitalizations? think long-term goal start acquiring robust herd immunity virus eventually fizzle out. point, virus easily find good hosts anymore, R0 value begins plummet, win game. Well sound options case. first kids mask send school. Obviously nerve wracking situation I'm also aware health issues concerns could make truly risky. According science though, even kids around kids wear masks, vaccinated yourself, fine. merely assuming kids compromises immune system I'm aware of.

Your second option find cyberschool absolutely recommend. kids getting authentic education social skills need cyberschool someone went one year, whole thing absolute joke. Kids need person teacher get proper education cyberschool provide that.

Your third option homeschooling them, may may feasible depending work situation. would also recommend since miss actively engaging students building friendships, would better cyberschool sure.

Your fourth option would find private school mandates masks students. Again, sure equipped would kind transition since private school pricey, first option something absolutely want avoid, would best shot. 

Those choices currently have. me, I'd suggest going first option. I've working hybrid school mandates year tell firsthand matter much tell students socially distance, much recommend wearing masks, exposures happen. far know, exposure happened either fluke student returned school healthy fine. matter kind school send exposure take place sending cyberschool rob education need grow.

My personal advice? Calm down, breathe, accept things alright. get vaccinated, please would help lot. kids fine, even end students wear masks. Transmission rates among children low we're point school start freely safely. skeptical that, well alternatives consider. people fully vaccinated seem died Covid, 1157 total breakthrough cases. That's around 1.5%

It's similar problem earlier pandemic calculating 5-7% fatality rate virus - capturing nearly cases confirmed case count. discouraged vaccinated people get tested - vaccinated people getting tested ones sick enough suspect COVID ones get tested job (healthcare workers, etc.). likely we're undercounting number mild asymptomatic cases among vaccinated groups large number (the applied unvaccinated people, lesser degree they're likely significant symptoms overall). vaccine receives FDA Approval, happen across country businesses. want healthcare costs skyrocket already have.  husband full blown Covid January got vaxxed late April. Pfizer side effects. First shot, mildly sore arm, second shot one full day tiredness. husband Moderna lucky second shot. chills, body aches, exhaustion said lasted like one full day miraculously gone. One difference drank ton water shot, husband ignored advice not. clue actually made difference go. good. know working marketed admit hurt vaccination effort

Maybe marketing went rogue circles see it. distinctly remember trials early roll-out stages, sensible people talking neutralising behaviour therefore protection infection expected decline, protection disease serious outcomes expected last longer.

No-one expected permanently neutralising vaccine? expert field?  Get test? yeah, tried give people benefit doubt, took advantage it, time start enforcing vaccines else world never going recover. mean sound like symptoms one day symptoms would really strange. Sounds like migraine me. may detest policies politics, encourages hesitant people get shots, great. Glad it. Excellent article!! Several studies shown immunity waning older vaccinated people vs younger people. one study somewhat ""extreme"" level, since compared elderly nursing home vs staff. Median age 86.5 vs 44. surprise results.

[Antibody cell memory immune response two doses BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine older adults without prior SARS-CoV-2 conclude, results demonstrate that, recommended vaccination scheme (ie, 2 doses BNT162b2), antibody cellular responses impaired COVID-19 naive older population compared younger group. work also shows post COVID19 memory response boosted two doses BNT162b2, 3-dose instead 2-dose strategy may relevant among COVID-19 naive older population.`

It also compared ""COVID Recovered"" immunity vs vaccine, found COVID likely gives better immunity vaccine.

Parts Canada opened prematurely. Even statistic accurate, cares? tracking hospitalizations deaths anyways. COVID years. point, say accept it. UK highest daily death toll yesterday since March. still near beginning 4th wave. yet. 

It interesting see bad gets decent portion population vaccinated. seem 4-6 weeks ahead us, goes well there, could good sign expect here. Hard say right now. Ah northwest Iowa. land worse Steve king Oh yeah, always people like that. üòñ I'm really sorry schools allow precautions. Best wishes hope everything works okay! LAUSD mandating masks students outcry, think parents okay it. I'm glad youngest graduated last year make difficult decisions anymore. feel terrible parents school-age kids going (and teachers, like you!). I‚Äôm breaking ‚Äòdon‚Äôt debate baby accounts‚Äô rule this.

We also don‚Äôt know COVID-19 infections affect us long term accepted true today may years now. curious, opinion effective vaccine look like? standard Right, among senior citizens, typically make vast majority hospitalizations, 95% vaccination rate. Looking full population vaccination rate stupid, kids rarely get hospitalized also unvaccinated. look vaccination rate population likely hospitalized. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, nothing worry all? phobia. Look data UK today, 40% people hospital covid vaccines, stat means vaccines reduce hospitalisation 90%+ (AZ/mRNA mix). better chance passing genes die 30. No. teams set. 4 total alternates Covid. even going about? live maryland despite stats news, boss still focuses breakthrough cases. thinks it‚Äôs proof vaccine doesn‚Äôt work even tho nobody ever said 100% effective. Literally nothing get Good luck finding Wasn‚Äôt Israel mostly Pfizer. Everything I‚Äôve read moderna stronger effectiveness variants due higher dosage. July 19 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared impose lockdown restrictions stop spread COVID-19 save elderly denied National Health Service would overwhelmed, former top adviser said interview aired Monday. Cummings also claimed Johnson wanted meet Queen Elizabeth, 95, despite signs virus spreading office start pandemic public told avoid unnecessary contact, particularly elderly. Despite questioning Johnson's fitness role prime minister castigating government's fight COVID-19, Cummings' criticism yet seriously puncture British leader's ratings opinion polls. Sure... full 74% people self diagnosed long covid seemingly never actually infected covid first place

There's proof never infected covid first place - self-diagnosed. real number people study never tested positive covid 72.9%. think need test result get across (unless missed something) yoy give cite? vaccine primes immune system pathogen. way react much quickly keep suffering worst disease. Probably general, restoring mask mandate halting large indoor events clearly warranted vaccine numbers least things trending again

That's kind happens abandon field halftime... Sounds reckless claiming [vaccine 100% whether protecting teens preventing hospitalization. would mix Pfizer something else? good known effects (the wanted ones side ones) Risk assessment matrices taught high school non ending stream $40k (or more) hospitalization costs per patient admitted can't pass genes lock away world meet anyone. know nightclubs far cry best place meet someone social interaction social species, survive coming together. unvaccinated ones choosing risk problem ours. Yup. Viruses mutate. saw coming. hello missouri? True point work that.
I hate British. Hating humans truly inexcusable. happens think speak. 
Pointing someone horrible, like horrible generalizations, make one good person indeed. 
Learning actions go.  big conclusions drawn specific event situation anyone anticipated CDC communicating lately.

Remember CDC said safest vaccinated people associate freely (maskless, close proximity) *vaccinated* people? Remember CDC said *vaccinated* people feel free wear masks? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

On serious note, immunocompromised person associating maskless someone also vaccinated. hope friends recover speedily. Cool! Thanks thorough explanation. next 10 years Jesus. Imagine 83% considered letdown. states like 30%...   Q: America...how many ijiots ewe got? 
A: Moar enough...2nds fur sure...3rds even... People talking boosters long vaccine even developed. lot research showing that, variety coronaviruses, body develop long-lasting immunity. That's get cold year-after-year. Israel data may simply manifestation long-suspected outcome. mention flu mutates covid, mutation sole reason vaccines decline efficacy time. Probably twisted sorts muddy ways. Immigrants example easily shrugged ""*that's fault*,"" handicapped also numbers, etc.

The illiterate also generally supported others enough visible like traveling place speak language, get see often one wiser.

Personal anecdotes: kid working construction summers often read blueprints many (6/\~30), got life spouses took care everything. took hunter safety course years ago, read test aloud teenager read (which absolutely terrifying). Two students high school class year graduated without able read despite disabilities - classmates probably even know it.  standard/tired whataboutism argument? media like Democratic party (as bad) Republicans party. argument merit.  think EU mostly BioNtech. Nothing I've said *attempted* prove ""a compelling argument contrary"". That's quite straw man built up.

I'm merely accepting fact FDA-approved vaccination. fact, debate. *is* FDA approved, support government mandate. Nope. going to. Israel vaccinated earlier though - rolled first doses back December almost 8 months dealing new variant (Delta) - could combination factors.  know waited little long this...but jackass started 'dont fauci FL' shit exact moment decided get vaccine. crashes also hurt kids. going stop driving?

No, ask kids wear seat belts, wear ourselves, we? write Click-it-or-ticket laws, we? 

Masks (seat belts) save lives. need start calling liars liars stupid stupid much more. intense desire polite people empathy respect public health dangerous counterproductive.  


We need stop letting brats stomp throw tantrums attempting respect .  Residents Spain work Gibraltar eligible vaccinated there, I'm 120% sure last time heard discussed vaccine rate 118% population. NIH fund nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance assisted research bat coronaviruses Wuhan lab, Fauci maintains qualified experts examined study ‚Äúup down‚Äù concluded constitute gain function research.

The article fails link name study. anyone know study talking about? Yes, Delta Variant concerning. transmissible viruses ever. least comes steps.... 100% certain COVID endemic think it‚Äôs still unlikely could mutate way restarts pandemic. expert though.  questions asked walk centres require information all. Takes quick google find. anyone reading live one states people really resisting vaccine? vaccinated? changed mind getting vaccinated? concerned?

I live Washington state, think around 70% vaccinated here. last weeks I've restrictions lifted. vaccinated completely comfortable walking around unvaccinated people. I'm still much avoiding people unless out.

I think biggest asshole move unvaccinated spreading shit choice. mention stupid logic spew pandemic, vaccine, election ever else makes want gag.

Covid, Delta, ever next never want around people again. everything fine world tomorrow would change mind. ""Full vaccination appears significantly protective partial vaccination prior infection, tested vaccines showed diminished effectiveness Delta, compared versions virus."" Also, can't equate asymptomatic mild cases naive individual asymptomatic mild cases vaccinated individual. Two completely different situations.   vaccine used there?  Canadian rural area, entirely correct. good caring lead action? cared, joined vaccine trial. cared, continued wearing mask public. else doing? important remark. Unfortunately we're left guessing Israeli government unable clearly express themselves. time alive!!  wonder elefants think react caffeine? follow post, here's first quality study I've seen kids ""long covid"".

The good news, ""long covid"" seems incredibly rare, quite mild  Alpha-Delta (and couple that) first discovered 2020, still extremely small numbers time wouldn‚Äôt quite say ‚Äúalready happened‚Äù prior first declared outbreaks thought researchers concluded Brazil herd immunity study like one described here? sadly proven completely wrong. risk permanent brain damage, losing tastes smells, worth $$$ working sure. Staying indooors vaccination rate like area? lambda, passed zeta already, apparently variant P.2 first detected Brazil. would suggest keep eye EU, mostly using Pfizer/Moderna. Netherlands delta likely dominant prevalence. Less 10% cases among fully vaccinated 40% fully vaccinated. agree. think major disconnect pandemic cancer deaths acknowledge latter cannot always helped, former, we've decided every death respiratory virus entirely preventable, that's incredible hubris level ordinary people indefinite amount time. far tell, data exist yet. Probably need months know. Mostly seen people sick enough need hospitalization, since people hospitalized unvaccinated, low. Vaccinated people hospitalized might awhile good data them.

The biggest risk fully vaccinated probably people also immunocompromised. again, would hard say right now. Looks like immunocompromised people probably approved third dose, help. right there, want 9 year old 4 year old vaccinated YESTERDAY.  He's brilliant man. No, isn't. Yessssss +++ Often suffering something, it‚Äôs ‚Äúthing‚Äù (virus, bacteria, etc) causing feel like shit, it‚Äôs bodies response cause. That‚Äôs way always understood it.  Hydrate hydrate hydrate. Electrolytes (pedialyte cheap stuff) get started. Hmm I'm sure data proves point. fact people describe exists true, sure. even data, proportion people would ""not get vaccine circumstance"" 60% higher CPC voters Green voters. there's fact 10x CPC voters Green voters overall (based last election). 

So math, every Green-supporting anti-vaxxer Canada, 16 CPC-supporting anti-vaxxers. 

Anyway trying pick fight, definitely right pockets ultra-hippy anti-vaxxers exist. They're probably small minority Canada's anti-vaxxers. Thank goodness pop year earlier. Yes pay price. agreed paying failed protect intellectually vulnerable population misinformation. UK shit show. feel like vaccinated don‚Äôt need self isolate pinged. going end everybody uninstalling app available needed. don‚Äôt answers maybe know American way would say F want anyway. course true. known vaccine efficacy new lineage lineage already widely spreading, many months originated.

We know vaccines incredibly effective Alpha though, still solidly Delta. ability make booster shots targeting Delta, choose so. definitely ""too late"" sense. also recommend immunocompromised people take caution. 'You continue take precautions recommended unvaccinated people advised otherwise health care provider' Haven‚Äôt always been?l

He‚Äôs still complaining rich nations vaccines, he‚Äôs person people follow sort plan distribute vaccines. authority compelling leadership briefing today, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, warned variants winning race vaccines, due inequitable vaccine distribution‚Äîfactors threaten global economic countries high vaccination coverage planning rollout booster vaccine doses dropping public health measures, pandemic over, said. However, notes sharp spikes cases hospitalizations parts world leading oxygen treatment shortages driving deaths higher Africa, Asia, Latin America. ""At stage pandemic, fact millions health care workers still vaccinated abhorrent,"" said vaccine nationalism occurring parts world ""We forced implement vaccine passports restaurants, bars, indoor public businesses want require masks all"".

That's it. That's message conveying. Definitely close, prolonged exposure case. Hope feel better soon. Thank you, that's worried about. continue lockdown fianc√©e never symptoms live together. didn‚Äôt lose taste smell either. Outside countries still people want vaccine

No country vaccinating everyone, delta certainly *some* concern kids.

I assume talking US, we're going pay price 25% anti-sciencers children catch COVID once, hospitals unavailable month, tax dollars pay all. hospital situation probably highly regional, everyone's paying taxes.   still good remember virus *some* headroom mutate spike protein well. See [this [old Nature shows older D614G variant spike protein mutated open form latch easily. Good. also work large tech company outside faang (UK based). initially told returning office next year, said October :/ I‚Äôm sorry friend still struggling, hoping get better soon. CDC say immune suppressed people still risk vaccines 100% seems accurate sadly.

Like said, big conclusions, 8 vaccinated people immunodeficiency, say 1 got symptoms, seems line told. seems sadly unlucky gathering‚Ä¶ First detected April India. four months later, nearly cases here.

Yup. spread real fast. Interesting, I'm sorry went that. yes experience vaccinated, probably safe say would much, much worse vaccinated immune system primed fight infection.

What exposure level mind asking? know. Sounds like pretty large exposure weather.

I've sore throat stuffy congested nose past days. However, ozone levels high could sore throat. MD/PA infection rates pretty low doubt I've exposed. way! TBH typing think around 80-85%. truth government mandated shit violates ""MAH FREEDOM!"" Knocked made eat dirt  looks like Delta causes lots death runs unvaccinated population living close quarters also appears hit peak couple weeks initial infections burns though UK/US/all vaxed nations see rise next 3-4 weeks come crashing down. 

I noticed UK cases dropped lot recently, surprised me. might right. Makes sense. That's probably ""no snags"" expected date, something. imagine that's readiness thing them, too. thinking give three months Sky get vaccine encourage folk get stay indoors Faucci convinced Geo W Bush African AIDS crisis threat US (Price Loyalty Paul O‚ÄôNeil) - certainly saved lives millions people. continue mask public? vaccinated individuals like you, still-unvaccinated otherwise vulnerable family members, extra caution makes lot sense. But, says Medical Director Cecilia Stuopis, dealing new variant may demand extra caution us. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need panic,‚Äù says, ‚Äúbut need take personal responsibility what‚Äôs necessary protect ourselves, families, communities.‚Äù starts getting vaccinated, emphasizes, doesn‚Äôt end there. ‚ÄúYou still wear mask,‚Äù says. ‚ÄúYou still avoid crowded indoor situations. still avoid eating large groups.‚Äù  ""Unprecedented"" meaning ""exactly thing happened four France's immediate neighbours past couple months.

It's odd expecting this.

I blame Boris Johnson, rather ""Boris Johnson moron"" meme, become pervasive no-one thinks UK representative example.

So Delta started take UK *two months ago* (so plenty warning, plenty), started providing world detailed data transmission advantages, rather taking advance warning taking appropriate actions, everyone dismissed ""well obviously happen here"".

And course caught UK first place no-one believed evidence India. weird snobbery way down.

It's still happening now, practically every thread sub someone Canada saying ""well we're handling OK"". Yeah... wait month see...  symptom know, however.

As pretty dedicated trail runner, would certainly careful exercising couple weeks viral infection. 16 months ago idea risky all, apparently is. I‚Äôm vaxxed got :(

So far, it‚Äôs like really bad cold - hoping doesn‚Äôt get worse. One contributing factor massive number tests done. delta arrived spiked areas surge testing-literally teams going door door mass test. Many employers regular testing staff, walk test centres over, school kids testing well. Basically lots testing everywhere free. Plus delta much virulent spreads easily. good news hospitalisations deaths risen way last years spikes, vaccines reducing serious cases death rates.  Article rounded down. Actual percentage 16.9%:

*Just 5.5% new cases within period detected among people fully vaccinated, Darias said, adding 11.4% partially vaccinated 83.1% unvaccinated.* Sean Connery would proud. would also curious well. would interesting see widespread COVID actually was.

I know think stupid, talking though. reality leaders world simply lost trust people years instead owning fact taking steps earn people's trust back, simply vilifying people immediately jump chance inject new vaccine bodies.

The government keeps economy closed, vaccine disease.   countries (like US) testing tracking people non-severe infections. unreasonable lift mask mandates *knowing* people states. bad call. üò£ mean? sure seems like said. specific subreddit asking questions covid? couldnt find meaningful amount members swarm-intelligently answer it.

anyway question is: socialize safely vaccinated twice? 

as far know rapid anti-gen tests dont work anymore vaccinated (twice) virusload carry goes much test work. question is, since delta variant still infect healthy, young, double vaccinated people - stay safe wanting meet friends? could test chances extremely high tests accurate. knowledge, much anymore.

i havent gone met friends anyway past 16 months scared got second shot today, would like try stay safe possible. do? news read say delta even infectious enough infect someone outdoors slight social contact. 

so would know safe meet friends tests sensitive enough? 

thanks helping answering &lt;3  ""Hey instead giving everyone clear headline let's give statistics problem implies opposite mean people, especially uneducated anti-vaxxers."" studies showing deadly. 

Also, study citing literally guessed variant based profiles variant different percentages different areas. assuming heck lot. Unfortunately doubt you‚Äôd find 12 jurors willing convict least third country believes anti-vax bullshit. fair point.

I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm expert. I‚Äôm pointing overall age health make difference regarding mitigating factors. otherwise healthy, young individual likely longer life span, they‚Äôre less likely die die reasons. Many recipients die due infections even organ failures. ultimate life expectancy lungs themselves. also dependent donor lungs too.

Only ~80% percent people even survive year transplant. 32% patients make 10 years. current median survival rate [5.8 point say assuredly survive next 20 years, assuming he‚Äôs otherwise good health he‚Äôs unlikely die issues better chance survival some. Instead, it‚Äôs combination health going forward donor lungs themselves. Given age, likely matched younger donor, available, affect chances. 

His new lungs may still give tomorrow. six months. Maybe he‚Äôll make couple years. absolutely may make 10 years too, longer lives, likely life expectancy continue improve. 10 years long time comes medical advancements. Regular vaping cause lung problems. thinking black market THC products caused problems years ago. They're different. How? people know kids die flocks. However, loved ones spread without single symptom. required vaccinations participate. Come Japan. friendly reminder everyone reasoning way data long-term effects vaccines long-term effects novel Delta variant. asshole, comment clarify anything significant? saying, all.  issue brand new. Kids haven‚Äôt even schools. ‚Äúhard evidence‚Äù. However, many people believe might be, OP stating study test it. Hospitals filling cases up. Jist great thanks people like that. really thought coming nope another round thanks idiots certain point, may safer fewer workers workers walking disease bombs. ""I must've put prefix wrong place something. always that. always mess mundane detail."" Thanks!! That's good question. anything worry fully vaccinated? far I've great success following local governments health restrictions, recently canned altogether. protecting vaccine. hope works us all.  think that? mean, static say that? arguing air travel good.. 

Well, no, aren't. We're arguing people turn blind eye railing cruises.

And, proceeded double triple that. Like, still can't get initial comparison said ships massive hotels constantly polluting weeks/months end 24/7 aircraft polute hours time people go destinations Normal housing/activities

Like, hilarious. single flight months months cruises thought: ""Yeah, that's good going stop travelling, reduce damage should.

Which would involve people travel air. Something admitted doing. Something willing bet large sums money little curb probably going increase get older income travel still bad environment far better c02 released cruise ships propulsion

Oh, shown links regarding much energy cruise ships emit ""just propulsion?"" Yeah, think shown those. did, missed analysis eliminated portion used HVAC interior spaces, energy used lights, energy used cooking food, etc. etc. Sure, pretty cheeky complaint, think shows intellectually dishonest (or, worse, think it) carbon comparison.

Your links ignored thing told first reply: ""Cruise ships massive hotels.""

I think either us time inclination full analysis comparing carbon emissions two accounting sorts things including cruise ship passengers, also houses crew, end day, they're big carbon emitters one wants dime cruise ships pollution, really avoiding flights well. 

Bottom line: hypocrite stop flying well. keep flying, can't really shame others choice travel. get it. pandemic still going strong rest world, certainly US either good chunk population vaccinated (either young, immunocompromised/allergy concerns, sadly vaccination). certainly time stop measuring/acquiring data, need information see need alter responses/determine things working.

And think back college working viruses &amp; thought coolest thing ever actually considered trying work CDC... Vaping negligible effect lungs barely worth mentioning.  would think. makes certain governors large, penis-shaped States conservative. military wants, takes. people survive what's left. That's way works Myanmar. organs prioritized based medical urgency proximity donor hospital. Kidney transplants use waiting time instead medical urgency probably kidney dialysis option. I'm kidney transplant waiting list 5 years. Well, we‚Äôre *global pandemic*. suspect times people less happy. also blame social media. also faced reality many people (MANY!) don‚Äôt friends beyond associates school work. social outlet co-workers classmates. Isolation set people immensely. Mandatory vaccine programs work. people can't afford lose job conspiracy. 

I hope employers start mandating it. wants part club! 
She get pass soon! one leadership position values political career adopt measures. That's reality. lives area low vaccinated everyone running around mask risk low think. People like cases   That's simply true. Hospitalizations started going there. 

Just like every wave before, lagged sharp increases cases. Vaccines helping temper effect, like every wave cases ends hospitalizations deaths. Go read study he's misquoting Especially considering seems like testing went down.  Think want 10 days recommended quarantine anyone testing positive now, afaik. Coworker mine got recently (not vaxxed) clear work 11th day symptoms began. 

Was still sick though returned. hospital setting US  Happy cake day! üç∞   I‚Äôve seen multiple health agencies across globe predict well since last year virtually non existent due measures taken covid. Also way flu shots created generally based prevailing flu strains opposite side world different flu seasons.


However, think also starting see cultural shift western world. Masks lot normalized. People spent year half taking extra precautions. may see benefits this. someone light asthma Ohio forced back office week CEO demands it, I‚Äôm scared. know least one person got delta variant already vaccinated Pfizer died. Capitalism may literally death me.  necessarily children. also adults. need spread slower hit herd immunity. never understand people say this.

""Well, eradicated, ever anything mitigate ourbreaks"" basically saying makes sense. 

Why hard people understand even smallest nuances rather kind black-and-white thinking? here. youngest (10) remains unvaccinated it‚Äôs source stress her. I'm sure getting pint pub worth lungs turn blood pudding. matter people understand statistics anyways fair enough, intuitive. headline serves confuse people embolden anti-vaxxers. Know audience, case average person. probably got even though vaxxed live conservative state vast majority people maskless unvaccinated. uk here, 17 years old, full time education work part time job hospitality. cant get vaccinated despite fact covid spreading extremely fast among people age. im scared lol   ""Living COVID"" may mean masking local outbreaks. don‚Äôt understand see little guidance students aged 12 though eligible vaccine. think masking makes perfect sense 2-12 school vaccine gets approved them, high schools going requiring mask fall, I‚Äôm skeptical they‚Äôll ever remove mask rule even full FDA approval. kids reacted well safety mesures spent school year person. much big deal. 
But vaccinated, would much like normal teenager‚Äôs life. 
We‚Äôll see. It‚Äôs like much choices situation. Cases conservative states people think like you. interview actual bear claimed seen another bear shit woods. info regarding Delta variant likely spread via surface touching? Like food packages, door handles, etc.

Thanks really get works We‚Äôre heading right direction. hit right park Vaccines help prevent (or least significantly reduce) odds Long COVID occuring we‚Äôll another argument belt. Even Delta increasing odds (or seems), appears ‚Äúprotects hospitalization death‚Äù isn‚Äôt cutting argument persuade young people get vaccinated. However tell vaccine helps prevent virus long term damage bodies may inclined Wearing mask actually helped get rid acne. never realized often touching face past So, two alternates going replaced alternates? tought little reached remember it‚Äôs US, people don‚Äôt really get vaccinated.

Delta 225% better hospitals filling millions unvaccinated people cocky wearing mask

Uh, are. keeping news? Check happened India currently happening Indonesia. Missouri, matter.

And, since vaccines work reduce spread, reduce chance infection, reduce chance hospitalization, according scientific studies real world efficacy, places greater percentage vaccinated people experiencing quick increase hospitalizations.  know downvoted. articles seem keep popping easy karma they're mostly nonsense approach logically. 

There's billions unvaccinated people planet. mention animals virus shown trouble spreading in. New variants appears anytime place. virus going spreading coming new variants years decades come vaccinate much planet new variant pop literally anywhere.  


Yes, people absolutely getting vaccinated. even US, UK Europe 100% vaccination compliance, new variants would still continue appearing around globe. viruses do.

There's good research showing Ivermectin works, countries using almost universally worst covid outcomes. Ivermectin extremely safe cheap might slightly improve outcomes given right exposure (especially vaccinated well), cure. Delta behaves like countries we're getting lot breakthrough cases. CDC track cases vaccinated. would right incentive! would cultivated social pressure ""get vaxxed!"" problem, probably hammered wrote fault unclear Hospitalizations gone rapidly recent weeks.

Maybe ~70% *eligible* people received *one* vaccine dose. barely 50% state's population fully vaccinated. Indeed, delta caused many reinfections previous lineages, importantly really contagious everyone likely exposed.

Search /r/covid19 ""previous"" recent hits phase 1 studies type. really lot show thing: vaccination natural infection gives incredibly high level measurable immunity. I'm confused comment. left took cyber charters, republicans fault? explain? No, really honestly.

Our numbers started rise, opened ton stuff kept decreasing long while. Vaccines 99.99% heavy lifting keeping safe. mask maybe adds couple hundredths protection, even that.

Then had, use hell them, like like 386 computer had. wildly substantially better stuff? I'm keeping Ryzen 3090, leaving 386 off. 12 hour only? Ban forever. Goes show shit doesn‚Äôt sink. Damn, I've got Pfizer cocky talking shit moderna folks. nature virus makes easy lot people get ""sick of"" disregard safety measures. invisible may directly affect people sickness-and-death sort way, yet disrupted everyone's lives way feels interminable. right, surprising people want shut ignore it. kept saying would way smarter explicitly state lifting mask mandates would happen soon approximately 70-75% state vaccinated. Yeah let anyone even 1 shot day covid tests accepted 40 hours event, that‚Äôs plenty time people go put risk, specially people willing go huge event.  SF Bay Area, parts PNW, northeast keep numbers low bonkers hear. Canada wore mask, even everyone else wasn't, we'd patting back. mean, wearing mask protect US (maybe even covid, maybe regular old flu cold). 

It's crazy think people would get upset caring enough protect safety. still mostly working vaccine mutates, need edit vaccine little bit really dislike Cummings I'm loving every moment laundry-airing.

The shit Hancock especially gold. Every additional exposure improves hones immune response. may identical immunity get caught covid vaccinated, though. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre smoking‚Ä¶ amount countries athletes involved Olympics makes Euro 2020 look like high school football championship. Euro 2020 hosted across like 20 European countries? faster vaccinations Japan? less countries, locations, open space less crowded cities. Tokyo crowded, slow vaccinations way fucking athletes countries involved. Whatever implying, it‚Äôs stupid wrong.  üéµ Hate say told so...Alright! üé∂ Dangling carrot work anymore.

[these break deaths, hospitalizations, age, partial vacccination, etc MD uncle dismissive March '20. think there's something medical profession requires halfway forgetting also creature biology order deal around many bodies breaking eyes.

(Uncle came around weeks things became clearer) Fuck UK government, honestly. 

They disobey tested dosing interval half cocked plan cover people single dose dubious best, delta elsewhere rips single vax dose people. 

And real reason say fuck UK gov say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre reopening!‚Äù it, there‚Äôs genuinely almost penetration vax people 30.

Possibly missing chance compete due cancelation would probably suck well. pace run people infect, import illegal aliens extra statistics. US far unvaccinated elderly people. numbers same, be, percentages ""look"" better respect vaccination.

Unvaccinated elderly risk. Vaccinated Elderly. unvaccinated young people. Due high uptake, englands demographics startlingly bifurcated, close people unvaccinated 30 (almost none die), 50 95+ percent vaccinated.

In USA, like third people 30, 80% vaccinated elderly. majority deaths come unvaccinated set elderly people, much bigger pool. Yeah people losing money. anti Covid vaccines crowd going lose. stalling, potentially kicking themselves.  Goes say number children hospitalized.

Even small number, still horrifying happens families involved medical staff trying treat child severe covid. pretty bad disease reaches point hospitalization. think hard, politically speaking, reimplement many restrictions point. lot people kind seem think pandemic behind us. They're wrong, regardless, outrage there's another shutdown, power might go it. Please afraid. 3 people household test positive taken first shot. first person sore throat cough, second fever, third symptoms. None lasting issues. 

Both Night fine. responsible, happen get - fight it! really issue feel bad Japanese people. Canadian whose county easy access vaccine, couldn‚Äôt imagine angry would selfish unvaxxed Canadian athletes went Japan spread disease. athletes actions cause death innocent people scared go get vaccine. like athletes Euro 2020 died COVID-19. see misleading either even good title, lol. anecdote, sister nurse working ICU covid patients pandemic. resisted getting vaccine recently employer forced (or lose job, assume). 

I really understand why. That's happened friend boyfriend. pfizer vaxxed got nasty runny nose, headaches, mild cough kept week. second week mild body aches symptoms, fine. boyfriend mostly asymptomatic. loss taste smell slight runny nose. fine week stayed lockdown.  Hieroglyphics? privately owned campground said, show wearing mask, shot sight assume rob us. last summer!! Wtf requirement vaccinations seems like gonna shit show

I mean, yeah. COVID going absolutely rip unvaccinated populations US. Canada higher vaccination rates still rising. Epidemiologists predicting everyone country either vaccinated contract COVID within year. imagine timeline quite bit shorter US. Forced vaccination answer either side border, roller coaster Honestly, something crowd funded? keep saying happen, matter finding right group, starting go fund me, buying many ad spaces possible? call made principle ""punish"" vaccinated.

Being principled good thing. lawfully stupid.  Lol I‚Äôm that! dunno much truth someone else thread saying also people getting shot day able attend.

How one ""stumble upon"" subreddit?
You came see people think, that's great, one good things reddit spare us ""stumbled upon"" narrative. feel compelled mask point? Canadians fly US anytime. US requires negative test, doesn‚Äôt need proof vaccination. US also mix mRNA vaccines doses fully immunized way Canada did. write anti-vax cosnpiracy stuff wet dream. Incomplete data sets allow lots BS. CDC thinking....we handle science right?  study Delta. next variant may show effect. heard confirmed COVID cases China got free medical care, job protection paid sick leave guarantees government.

I actually think would 9:1 ratio, probably like 99:1 ratio.

The societal norms China, Japan, Korea quite well known family community focused.

We saw even overseas communities like Richmond, Canada, Chinese population caught spread much less neighbors. first voluntarily stay home avoid gatherings, take protective precautions, mandated government. 56% full population, mentioned article linked above, 80% adults. even 30% vaccinated, reckon worse last year? 30% isn‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs lot better 0% vaccinated last year. Yeah... never mind 1.4 million Boomers drafted Vietnam War. problems trifling compared woes Millennials Boomers.

Whoever decided let people around world come together unvaccinated is, rightfully, politically fucked. sub heavily skewed towards people rough Covid. Lol better rate airport? federal government blame that. Federal government cut funding 20 years ago tell exactly many hours type staff based acuity patients. also reimbursement rate staff have. paid would get better staff. Many (possibly most) states reporting unvaccinated people hospitalized.

Most hospitalizations likely still Alpha, since Delta passed case counts weeks ago. know severe disease Alpha vaccination nearly impossible. 

This change Real Soon Now, we'll see. US much less age-specific vaccinations - lot older unvaccinated people countries, quickly fill hospitals.  Red Rocks fully capacity, masks, almost month heard outbreak look outbreak list weekly. story seems off. doubt could happen nothing place concerts almost eveynight 10k people? seems weird. access N95s?

Beetlejuice

Beetlejuice im assuming thats last hear this. take guess think next spring things done with. Next summer normal throughout world.

It's still taking time countries around world get vaccinated. think could well one cycle fall winter.

The cycle fall/winter might bad happen, think surveillance period one important watch remain little concerned with.

The cycle fall winter probably take place children going back school, also possibility colder weather combined children getting infected could lead spikes. Also possibility double whammy Flu Covid variant, though never happened last year flu infections way down. something watch respiratory illness historically higher fall/winter things supposed going back normal.

Afterwards spring think enough immunity vaccines natural infection. Even newer variant, vaccines seem effective think booster shots possible hard distribute.

Not think go away, point vaccines natural immunity cases, hospitalizations deaths lower remain lower.

All said think contraversy remain though kids currently cannot get vaccine debate whether need many effected bad. Can't blame parents concerened. Likewise variants stay around cause new problems. economy demands even obviously isn't.

Before vaccines, virus scary random. experiencing symptoms, yes.

If aren't, know. think answer no, sure.  would .95*.4 allowed play vaccinated? provides marginal extra protection much think.

How much extra protection think provides know Bringing mask mandate back great way get people say well get vaccinated still wear mask wont get vaccinated, whats point?

Now that's completely different discussion think want you. Thankfully, area required masks since April so. even carry mine anymore. lets recap: lied guidelines. (yes, lied). lied durability immunity. Maybe sit one out. someone please explain something me? 
I'm anti vaxxer, means, got shot (waiting second one). numbers look great, definitely show vaccine works.

But I'm seeing something slightly worrying numbers. Granted, sample sooo small might meaningless, today, 18 people fully vaccinated seem died Covid, 1157 total breakthrough cases. That's around 1.5%. thought vaccine supposed also reduce mortality case breakthrough case, numbers (again, really small N), make look like people Virginia breakthrough cases slightly higher chance dying. 


I'm almost definitely seeing things wrong, someone please explain I'm misunderstanding?  Apparently immune systems stopped working somewhere along road antibodies produced naturally anymore. Maybe get one hazmat suits. last lot longer 6 months. Please stop misinforming people. vaccines made Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna set persistent immune reaction body may protect coronavirus years, scientists reported Monday. Hospitalisations per case fallen 2.4% compared 8% January/February. That's 70% decrease note data includes hospitalisations (not among vaccinated) number well excess 70%. PHE estimates 92% AZ 96%  Super curious well, think know answer... adults choosing vaccinate, that's one thing. I'm worried children folks medically can't vaccinated. 

Masks suck I'll still wear GIVE SHIT. Wearing mask takes zero effort. They‚Äôve struggling now. would happily give vaccines. Let anti-vaxxers without save lives around world. 99.4 percent cases unvaccinated people. 

""they even know vaccine works yet!""  mom‚Äôs work requires everyone tested 3x week, vaccinated not. works ltc home Ontario. anyone point good articles data risk severe illness kids Delta? kid young get vaccine, adults close contact fully vaxxed.

Pfizer said months ago need booster, CDC said No. know working marketed admit hurt vaccination effort. 100% adult population vaccinated we'd planning booster yesterday. One least favorite brands ableism. I'm seriously asking alternative here. Remain aghast forever? hedonic treadmill runs ways reason. curb things stayed family friends groups then? we're masking public transit crowded public spaces walking around (not seated restaurant). Geographically, agree majority residents live high vaccination areas. 63% Virginia‚Äôs population live either Northern Virginia (DC burbs), Hampton Roads, Richmond Metro. also suspect Venn diagram people living deep red Va like Lynchburg hanging out/visiting Fairfax County low low vaccinations rates wouldn‚Äôt even make difference given high vaccination rates NOVA. truly like two different states.  lol neutral question, look numbers. telling someone indefinitely put (social) life hold despite vaccinated, I'm guessing good reason I'm unaware of. Thank you, took load trick! Yea, I'm hoping I'm Sunday. second shot took day off. We'll see goes üëç Better constant BS insane rules here. I'd gladly lock two three weeks knew afterwards everything normal. 

Yes, China's strategy (and NZ's, Taiwan's, etc) constant jeopardy rest world. followed example March 2020, would better shape afraid open up. 

We exit strategy either lockdowns looming winter many countries despite vaccines. Masks mandates reinstated. Travel restrictions continue. Etc. win one! Yeah uhm comment said either lot breakthroughs make facts known vaccine vastly improves odds.

95-99% Covid hospitalizations unvaccinated patients. love idea making mandatory airline travel. 

I think public schools get board make part existing vaccine requirements it'd also help lot toward vaccination rates. Unvaccinated parents would likely get alongside kids. 

My 13 year old vaccine (2nd shot Pfizer yesterday) I'd feel lot better friends well. one friends second dose too, they've already scheduled first post vaccine sleepover. really looking forward multi person sleepovers again, I'm pretty firm requiring anyone sleeping fully vaccinated whole household double vaxxed spending night off.

One friends also coming second dose end summer least 3 person sleepover. Hopefully need hear parents. 

I wish schools would require friends would vaxxed. I've read somewhere around 66%-68%.....which would qualify vast majority would say.

I'm assuming Guardian's figure 54% based old data. blog. Use reputable source, please. kind figured much. Thought I‚Äôd put least positive spin it! :) fair, CDC‚Äôs guidance *vaccinated* people, everyone. understand social science behind faulty CDC supposed provide accurate medical advice, social science advice. probably mad states lifting them. Amen. One wonders. That‚Äôs awesome! reiterate poster said, seems like one predict symptoms. me, ‚Äúpre-gamed‚Äù sick vaccine, made sure hydrated days before, pre-made easy meals, took day work, made sure sleep, picked bunch movies watch. However turned one fortunate ones mild side effects. 39 well. Hope helps! heard viruses trade deadliness contageousness, general. data supports delta less deadly previous strains? Among unvaccinated course  Even someone breaks Barney style believe want understand it. Lmfao vaccine rules make slow mandate result bureaucracy it‚Äôs inefficiency, there‚Äôs real practical reason take long circumstance. words government made problem I‚Äôm expected remask can‚Äôt unfuck policies? Ridiculous, winning war dependent getting people vaccinated they‚Äôd get done, now. could correct. sad, say least. Tested negative symptoms personally go bars unmasked one vaccine, think top careful. pointing silly say masks add anything top vaccines. 5G tho  Also, quality education effects well, believe. IvErMeCtIN MiRaClE DrUg Well, booster think we'll okay..just matter when.. promising. Everyone honestly. Especially israel report. want know vaccine agree need vaccinations Missouri 60% pop vaccinated masking help think wont happen them.

Or people consider reduced risk worth expense inconvenience safer infrastructure new laws. people different priorities risk calculations mean thought issue. thought issue come different conclusion did, that's all. what‚Äôs vaccination rate?   major superpowers world would never let happen reposted  dad thinks got someone work, mom got dad, wife got mom. tested negative twice never got symptoms may lucked out.

If everyone gets vaccinated covid becomes much worse cold, I'm pretty happy outcome. Oh, takes serious. Cats? Mr.Whiskers variant, Fluffy variant, Chairman Meow variant

Dogs? Bark Ruffalo variant, Kareem Abdum Jabark variant

Owls? Hootie Blowfish variant  Again, lack transparency Chinese government becomes huge embarrassment Chinese people. local council 770K+ area major Chinese city failed fool mother homeowners non-covid issue, wonder long Beijing continue fool international society. Dead kids. still waiting jab? 3 friends 27 got Johnson jabs last week pharmacy dublin. lol @ Men‚Äôs Health. Look comments article though - calling ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù. don‚Äôt understand many right-wingers calling that. guess case, federal gov need pass laws (I know happen) would give authority cdc scenarios like these. past 30 days 26 deaths 5641 cases unvaxxed, 0 deaths 173 cases vaxxed. vaccine absolutely works, also chance unvaxxed dying extremely low. point stands same. thinking this. Given three vaccinated yet three breakthrough cases makes wonder prolonged exposure (assuming one initially gave two) becoming greater greater chance get covid whether vaccinated not. Obviously lowering severe outcomes makes worth friends vaccinated act like practically impervious getting it.  funny minds work. train plane crashes today hundreds die, see lot impact news society. People feel afraid.

However, Covid kills close one thousand day country, became regular number nobody really feels like tragedy care anymore. Isra√´l often unexpected results Yeah, highly infectious delta making rural social distancing less helpful factor. time people ""unsure"" coddle feelings society collapses around us.

When plane falling sky, sit dialogue person blocking door they're scared skydiving. strap parachute kick door, rest us get alive too.   Keep mind go state state, much better compare going whole country, America 1 state 85 3 80 23/50 states 70%. know everyone loves shitting America many states large population centers well Europe. fair, CDC says unvaccinated need mask. happen here? anyone masked? sorry hear. talking people (with rare exception) people unwilling something will: 
1. Cost nothing
2. Possibly save life
3. Possibly make major health problems rest lives
4. Possibly save live others
5. Make life easier better society
....

We talking (with rare exception) selfish, misinformed people. eligible. entire UK population closer 54%. would lol. really, staying careful, utilizing masks feel needed. elderly person family probably extra What‚Äôs criteria tocilizumab? I‚Äôm curious standard care days.  what‚Äôll next excuse getting vaccinated‚Ä¶? Traffic safety. problem see otherwise excellent suggestion: people idea people pulled together WW II. do? Target age group COVID 19, half society resoundingly demonstrated give rat's ass killing 'em off. CA's population higher though, need normalize population. Critical Care Unit I‚Äôve working week SC (I clinical staff, policy guy) converted back COVID unit end July.

Would like send s/o mouth breathing geniuses graduates YouTube University causing us backslide putting healthcare professionals back harms way. 

I assure every single nurse unit pissed you. I‚Äôm jealous American France would theoretically work, given vaccine certificate getting second jab.

However, hand paper getting jab, cross-referencing, would probably found tried sneak out. Plus contact details. would probably contacted explain myself. view hybrid work best yes roles work fine fully remote. Vaccines extremely effective Delta real world studies:  actually got worse difference getting vaccinated ‚Äúsniffles versus suffocation,‚Äù Colfax said.  Context. 

The recent surge cases seen young people 18-30.

Due UK's policy rolling vaccine age condition, young healthy people started getting invited take first vaccine months back, people aged 30 getting late early June.

Many people getting covid moment spreading therefore:

* vaccinated all, or
* vaccinated thus best possible protection 

This news bad news vaccine, fact opposite: someone posted above, last time 7 day average cases high (on 1 Jan 2021) 7 day average daily deaths 600. Right now, thanks vaccines, 42.  need check bank blasts classic rock.  think sides thing right now, left immune (no pun intended) cult thinking. 

Also, huge deza component. see language echoes last year's hard right response: ""Well, stay home then"" ""go hide bed."" We're seeing supposedly fully vaccinated people say people ready return normal. I'm guessing half troll farm accounts half rubes pick messaging repeat it. 

Leadership acting like hostage situation whole mask thing, although suspect nearly left leaning pretend be.  40,000 people die ‚Äúmonth‚Äù due obesity related health problems, that‚Äôs something within control Tucker Carlson using rhetoric get people take vaccines. Congratulations! Private community. Take screenshots. fucked I'm surprised. GOP/anti-vax grift either vaccinated, quietly pushing behind closed doors, and/or best healthcare available things go south.

But they'll push grift everyone else. fit narrative certain subset seem quite active sub. support point Yep. gets there, eventually. believe FL publishes stats Fridays.  know US we're tracking severe cases. data countries starting understand long covid, still much unknown. 

Long covid seen ~ 30% cases including asymptomatic mild cases, would include vaccinated.

One study April found 34% Covid-19 survivors received diagnosis neurological psychological condition within six months office national statistics saying 7-9% kids experiencing long covid symptoms according Guardian - Aus estimate apparently 8% according MIT technology review - links - long covid kids: lawyer argued along lines defamation case tucker carlson, ""im democrat but..."" usually tip person fact democrat. Also IQ potato. Keep mind due lag associated cases resulting hospitalization/death, sharper rise cases underscore number hospitalizations/deaths, methodology. 

The January 1 date came sort small wave+plateu. know much means current hospitalizations underscored by, some. go get third dose, then? Seems better wasting it.  40k Americans killed every year car crashes, incredibly difficult get safer infrastructure built laws passed. People think wont happen them. wearing helmet car top wearing seatbelt would safer too, don‚Äôt efficacy original COVID. That‚Äôs irrelevant mutation 

Did read wrote?

Both Uk Canada tested Pfizer's efficacy Delta found around 80%, slightly lower original strain. Protection hospitalisation death even higher closer previous strains well. us talked policy employer implementing way taking heads Fox‚Äôs we‚Äôd fired. Yes, spike protein mutates mrna vaccines won‚Äôt effective. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre concerned rampant community spread delta. Scary times :/ I'm wondering many athletes impacted getting covid, quarantine due close contact. Olympic villages usually pretty crowded. Honestly could get kids vaccinated anti vax people go hell care put things perspective, vaccinated 300 million Americans, 15 million (5%) could still potentially get Covid, based 95% efficacy. need stop worrying breakthrough cases. expected would see breakthrough cases people get vaccinated. Good. don‚Äôt agree forcing someone get vaccine, I‚Äôm totally okay shaming make right decision. much. 

Remember, U.S. severe shortage tests first 6-8 months pandemic, regions still shortage lab capacity process tests. 

That testing deficit still shapes testing policy US. attitude vaccinated people going spread virus, testing waste scarce resources. 

As time passes, evidence policy needs change, CDC taken action yet.  Others removed re-posts, stays primary source reported elsewhere. lol bet believe lab leak theory Meat.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 60% decrease efficacy vs severe disease would mean 35% efficacy

Does it? talk 60% increase contagiousness, multiply original number .6; logically, that's well.

.95 \* .6 = .57 sounds think regional thing. highest daily death total since March 2021. highest daily death total whole pandemic 1,725 January, vaccines introduced.

For comparison, last time infections reached 45,000 one day 600 deaths average. 45, reduction 90%. Canadian well, agree. suspect largely related insular much American society is, say, that's whole discussion. Cheers! would guess would dramatically reduced vaccination, still possible mean, accurate Israel. Based UK numbers, accurate UK. Based Canada numbers, accurate Canada. Haha doesn‚Äôt fit narrative it‚Äôs def misinformation! Thank tuning dismissing things don‚Äôt agree believe! anything harm you. either help work, anything.

Not really anything fear. assuming indeed ensuring safety vaccines, which, again, fully tested.

There big assumption nothing bad come based little data, that‚Äôs level guarantee happy mandated businesses government, hope stand fight next thing try mandate, may late. doubt slows anything still fly Florida BBQ yard think true variety reasons, especially:

1. Less people go back regardless whether it‚Äôs mandated

2. Yes delta way contagious maybe people wear mask grocery store Walgreens whatever stop cases, large virus spreads people getting together indoors talking, eating, drinking together. There‚Äôs way mitigate stuff without people taking actions own, don‚Äôt see happening way again. Friendly reminder please judge Poles behavior ""anti - vax"" few. Hurry up.

The CDC dragged feet this. knew would happen dropped mask mandate (unvaxxed people would drop masks without getting vaccinated). tell immunocompromised people ""behave vaccinated.""

Immunocompromised people much protect one else around wearing mask. much quote believe attributed Stalin death one man tragedy. death millions statistic. certain point becomes impossible understand meaningful way, another negative headline. white race. little late dick wad still Spotify? Love this. wish states adapted it. bad misinformation ""news networks"" broadcast data.

Hospital networks across nation study study showing 98+% COVID hospitalizations non-vaccinated now. There's nary whisper false facts channels. guys think safe say draw conclusions VA state data % reported break cases vs overall cases apply states similar vaccination rates?

From tell, around 2-3% cases reported breakthrough VA. 54% full vaccination rate.

Safe assume state like NY, 56% vaccination rate, would see roughly 2-3% breakthrough case rate?


Of course wouldnt guess states got ass actually posted helpful data like VA Yeah data interesting imperfect- vaccinated really tested course going many cases. 

Of course perfect data would certainly large gap, would quite large numbers suggest? likely not.    Jews also allowed hold many jobs."
