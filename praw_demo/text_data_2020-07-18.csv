0,2020-07-18," gonna call CPS? that's another problem children going school. lose important safety net. ""Yesterday standing edge cliff- today, today one step further!"" exactly helping religion's image.

 get trump led example took seriously, would way better chance getting re-elected. people would support credit saving lives. could stroke ego knowing alot country favorable opinions him. could boast prime example America greatest country world. Literally nothing negative could've came it. thing goes people taking seriously, positives massively outweigh negatives.

But nope, he'd rather fucking dumbass ignore it, potentially ruin chances elections, make America global laughing stock, let hundreds thousands die. people claiming ""infraction freedom"" shit. Fuck them. really can't even force feel bad people get sick. America looks like currently joke, guarantee 6 months future, countries long since moved on, America still struggles many people care, neither government. People still die cancer. COVID deaths (mostly) added top. influence election? fuck people get info? See, playing 4d chess. What's best way increase GDP per capita? Get rid capita! That’s even close thing. filters 3M mask huge expensive. mask small $1 filters. proving half Americans won’t care government we’re put camps well. 

Speak demand change die already, ffs numbers get better go thru CDC anymore sounds like county work.... weeks ago went 1 case like 250 nowhere... one church. people care.

Actually, that’s true all. people ones wearing masks, distancing, generally part get virus control. That’s needs happen in-person learning resume safely. It’s anti-mask, viral hoax, “just flu” crowd doesn’t care working parents supposed manage child’s education home working. care, would done everything power keep viral spread control allow schools reopen. Unfortunately there’s pretty much one way make monoclonal antibodies. get B cell originally produced antibody fuse cancer cell. creates immortal cell line called hybridoma crank antibody forever. secrete liquid media they’re growing purify there. Monoclonal antibodies already fairly useful treatments diseases cornerstone molecular biology research, people trying figure make less money basically long they’ve around. good news large-scale, medical-grade production protocols already exist. bad news probably aren’t going new, massive breakthroughs anytime soon COVID. insane hope feel better soon  Everyone needs take science class! wearing every cold flu season already, bar, saves single life? mean, good enough job spreading it, that's certainly one way get house prices sensible level. democratic party tell Bernie's ideas impossible even though great examples healthcare education nations Think learned lesson impeachment yet? UCP United Conservative Party. They're right wing party Alberta. NDP New Democratic Party. One american philosophy is: get something, deserve it.

This main way thinking there. everyone got virus (assuming accept virus hoax), deserved it. also full think catch (because *more better* rest population). change nothing kind people.

If take ones think god punishment well... change nothing either.

And ones saying hoax? even believe images real.

You need change way people think make acknowledge virus danger represents. can't seem find info changes elementary middle school.  would elementary kids spread less?  Lower lung capacity? big kids?  son going 4th grade sitting 5'7 140lbs, he's already bigger kids middle school..... Good luck Home Depot. Good luck megacorps.  actually enjoyed wearing mask. make eye contact smile. one recognizes me. Everyone leaves fuck alone. glorious thing. Anti-maskers know missing! Wait, missing staying alive. don’t care.... brain washed minds made Fellow person done this. I'm ditching lot people Facebook right second pandemic total idiocy. Proud antimaskers sharing fake news gross things like comparing mask wearing ww2 bringing ""I can't breathe"" 

I'm done idiots. using lockdown good clear house, mind people associate with. Quality quantity People naturally criticize Russia ethics, works they'll shut fast. strange one profits anti mask propaganda. literally win win situation everyone involved. (Wookie roar) Don’t worry, next Democrat office held account, lol. Yeah, makes sense. It’s similar midwest. Interesting read  think still job? he's unwilling it, that's worldview. Remember, Fauci managed AIDS crisis too. exact argument. health care workers, clinical evidence always proof one needs follow guidelines. first good news months! Thats really cool, congrats! No. Miami governor initially said going reclose things got push back closed indoor dining. Miami fucking mess. live healthcare worker point, think HMOs US want people get sick make money years post covid. Ron DeSantis. think we'll hit 200k election. Ah yes waiver responsibility. fault making go potential Covid break out. American way full effect....pass blame.  assist school nurse. trained look kids want say they’re sick go home. refuse that. said “who say someone else feels? don’t feel well, I’m letting go home!”

Unfortunately, much pressure students. They’re afraid they’ll fall behind go home. Many times they’re sick begging go class. pandemic could likely kill me. ""1 death tragedy. 1 million deaths statistic."" masks. Wash hands. Socially distance (6 feet). 

You can't open bars tell people socially distance themselves. Close bars. Close restaurants. crystal ball neither you. slow down, helps SAVES LIVES I'm willing go along ""intrusion"". really smallest inconveniences. Vietnam death everyone tickle stay home work, leading complete collapse society not?

Yes, sane society would prioritize health people profit-making needs businesses. Ope looks like time open phase for! Vermont cured weeeee.. 
*4 weeks later* 
Whaaat?! arent going back phase 2 forget hoax masks lockdowns protecting others, back work slaves! colossal failure leadership. many people must die President give shit. thought masks supposed prevent wearer spreading it, getting it. science denial? It’s street outdoor bars. It’s organized event. hasn't.  Little kids left alone. Hell, 6-year-old nephew still sometimes needs help wiping going bathroom, he's going microwaving lunch himself. way district. meant absolutely every day. believe change. 

It might seem pointless attendance correlated better performance better grades. Schools really push attendance best performing students. understand schools want think means tweaked teaching students wrong thing. teaching listen bodies force work even need rest. lol Oh boy. I’m glad got everything need month people start getting stabby shootie. Ok Christian coworker come _strep throat_. gotten corporate dystopian nightmare retail management deprogram her. 

She like, “I’m sorry. sure? can...” all, ”Go home!” According worldometer, looks like US death rate 8% Quick, somebody go back March show Fauci! Oh wait, known him. It’s SaFE OpEN sChoOls. KiDs CaNt CaTcH mean, isn’t collapse civilization then?

Maybe profits need keep increasing year year. shocked.  doubt it, tbh. Everyone would get desensitized, people would either quit watching keep ""won't happen me!"" mentality. I'm fairly certain she'd signed go ER without calling, nothing would happened her.

I'm also fairly certain pretty easy call go ER, even things bad. kids get it!!!! - sarcasm Move France, actual human beings instead feral sociopaths. Damn, getting annoyed seeing snaps gatherings friends posting.

Activated snap map mine seeing post. Goddamn.  anyone find odd one side adopted masks side anti-mask? sometimes human stupid things dies say?  says lot Sweden, much US. That's good place avoid then.  used go sub everyday virus first broke convinced going die. Turns agenda play bamboozled surprise, government want help us want what’s best us. remember well, must admit 'clean everything' train awhile myself.

It seems first directions given sticking power. plenty evidence replies shown, people still sticking original ideas. said masks.

The lesson - careful instructions given public, hard change tracks things start going certain direction. Agreed. Time local municipalities refund taxes related school systems though right? Can't see reason paying school systems open. Thanks sharing stories! Unfortunately jabronis ruin things rest us. Depends whether want happy ending.  think brilliant idea. also think people, couple included, know Faraday cage bit ankle. Ive always wanted live Vermont. moving country instead, still would live there. 

Congrats, Vermont! Hurt followers first. already hate them, ignorant cows. Put policy things make worse rich arrogant Southern white man: reparations blacks, caps much environmental damage industries do. Tax them, shut tax exemption churches. Enforce learning history minorities. Enshrine protecting abortion law.

They'll fucking die things. They'll hurt bad they'll stroke become massive burden new socialised medicine platform sounds like communism everything Jesus stood for.

You'll learn enjoy pain, one day, someday, genocidal campaign wipe out. feel good. understand households difficult implement parents work. ""Not picking up"" free food excuse let child starve, however--that point CPS called. also adequate justification death toll result sending children school convenient option certain families. 

Do understand suggesting going result tens hundreds thousands additional infections (of children, parents, teachers) thousands additional deaths? explain feel tradeoff justified? neither it, matter close are. think masks stop it, like believe wear masks eradicate virus everybody end getting end? slow down. aNgElS nOow.  ""Do attempt stop chainsaw genitals"" _not_ dare bluff Wisconsin!!!! 6feet arbitrary. less 6ft that's used many countries. much power corporations companies get laws changed Germany? I'm curious, long lived China? Source? be....when half staff infected. New York paid dearly knowledge handle Covid-19.

Learn maybe states see number deaths. Yea handed election win silver platter threw away. It’s baffling. poll numbers highest ever first weeks this. he’s simply let cdc thing lead, could sat ass way easy re-election win. Oh sure knows call lose job ability effect anything. Weird mother law cancer best covid perfectly fine feels great. “3 good reasons” perfect attendance culture, unavailable alternative options child care (specially sick), lack workplace schedule flexibility. case you’re wanting TL/DR. fucking high?

Cuomo's executive order mandated nursing homes refuse Covid-positive patients. Straight hospitals, back nursing home infect everyone there. fact, even allowed TEST residents coming in. 

The bulk death NY Cuomo's pen.

But correctly?

If Cuomo Republican would facing charges right now.

Lol. Fauci political hack even funny. Judging Instagram ""models"" taking suggestive photos States, including LV, spike could young adults simply care anymore. fair, masks available dont protect person wearing them. helps minimize spread. N95s proven protect virus prioritize healthcare workers. wont, cares? Monthly injections. disease, Three weeks covid

Trying stop demons dancing head still visit get test first. niece family Boston. Quick easy results 24 hours. America joke. Can't wait ends finally move country working in. EDIT; create paragraphs. brutal friend. 🙂 ok People sleep DPRK’s science tech capacity.

A significant section populace works horticulture agriculture, it’s like lack tech capacity. well [memory able develop nukes.

They’re poor they’re stupid oppressive; they’re poor rest world refused trade fall USSR. could also different strains. got antibody test person took blood said multiple strains even got positive needed continue wearing mask distancing California didn’t let bunch old people die obviously bad move. Absolutely worth reading Ah man. Well put perspective company (in med sales ) put high risk alert get covid. Meaning layoffs will
Be first go. won’t even close location work home. “Only way close someone gets covid office”. 60% us ever sick will
Show up. severe bronchitis October went prove sick since one believed me! Corporate america baby! stock invest hospitals full, plenty available beds. Cuomo sent risk covid positive patients nursing homes without care doctor let alone ICU. usually bunch tourism fall leaf peepers come. actually fortunate happened mud season, rather dreary time year VT standards.  think it’s time halt protests I've stayed home alone since 7. hard attend virtual school make simple sandwich/burrito lunch. 90% people know united administration. drive trump flags almost every farm field pass daily. joke?

Because we're reddit, site leans overwhelmingly leftist. large gatherings beach huge impact. Restaurants bars nearby, sure. thousand people beach spread virus much. exactly right. It’s sad disgusting That's honestly interesting way test workload appropriate employees. What? course handled well. bumpy start figure everything own. Whatever dumbass state following lead. probably common know. rules “if you’re kid sent home fever can’t come back next day”, working parents get desperate. Love Barnard General Store Well yea officials encouraging mass protest June. would care now? district sounds like act together. That's great. think tutoring become important too, even hours/days bit non-standard. Hope students well, things considered, hope parents stay well. won't. 

We learned H1N1, Obama creating whole pandemic task force, shut 2018. Lol let guess, it’s bullet head Books cooked likely sure Biden's inauguration draw lot Trump's 

Unfortunately, probably happen covid. state far ahead NY, oh noble wise guinea pig? He...he didn't. New York disaster entire way basically became 'epicenter' thing long China shut information output regarding it. Cuomo's handling nothing less disastrous, media treating Florida, much higher at-risk population population, ridiculous. positivity percentage based test results received day. 61,988 tests waiting results. So, could entirely plausible percentage positive reported 16th tests done week two ago given backlog working First First tests. 40k dead state 20 mil people. Riots looting murders every day. right. mention economy speak biggest drop NYC real estate prices history rest nation's prices hold well. Good job. Fake news

SARCASM. ffs Well, US sure felt like singular entity flew around world bombing crap countries, right ask world change way see us, now?

In seriousness though, it’s true US vast country 50 states actually good job containing virus, doesn’t change fact one fucked state going fuck states short amount time. resident California, hate see Arizona fuck badly even though things handled relatively better here, point things go south easily unless critical decisions made Washington DC take necessary precautions. lazy change that. Via Wikipedia campaign, Stitt called ""the job creator proven business experience"" running governor emphasized business background. called state become ""top 10 job growth, top 10 education top 10 infrastructure.""

How ""successful"" people served ""important positions industry"" ***be stone-cold stupid?*** report post? look gets reported. someone reported yours. Right on. seem currently sitting pretty Covid situation time start taking risks. moment Trump administration fighting Senate's insistence testing tracing funds provided.

I cannot make imagine asymptomatic cases overall. People 18 likely asymptomatic, reducing risk spread coughing (obviously risk zero). Adults asymptomatic also reduced chance transmitting (again, still chance, smaller someone who's coughing duration illness)  Personally vast majority young people see wear masks. people see aren’t wearing masks older, 40s-60s freezing take IMO. hate people. Glad hear Doctor survived Covid 19 say? PM AutoMod deletes it, pls personally think Oxford Vaccine could silver bullet results seem promising enough I'd (almost) willing get day one available. 


But know sure August Phase 3 trials conclude. I'm much less confident vaccines now, Oxford one fails, may deeper trouble. hope vote massive numbers large suppress get guy people office. you’re right, it’s hard see faster solution scares too. first time life, vote republican candidate. Fuck twat. Well written article also apply US schools not? curve large mimicked countries

It's not. I'm writing this.

It went 1800 daily cases 120 12 days. another week get 4. That's complete BS.

Show country went ton almost nothing less 2 weeks?

This theoretically possible suddenly everyone, mean EVERYONE absolutely anything except stay balloon. can't happen people still need eat.

Literally every country seeing mild slope new cases day go lower lower, according model predicts new cases based modified R, existing active cases. Everything do, eventually changes R number. get steep slope downwards need reduce R practical zero, can't place people live isolated produce food isolation. possible. Plus everyone inside breathing recycled air conditioned air pretty much states peaking, AZ, TX, FL Yep. It’s hard times. I’m struggling sheer state US right now. went coastal NC Oklahoma it’s insane see difference virus handled. Plus grandmother sick Oklahoma. high risk can’t get rapid test supposedly aren’t available. It’s scary situation people small towns get false sense security. literal propaganda people’s local news paper telling nothing worry about. look grandmother could covid can’t get rapid test without going ER. bad idea due autoimmune issues slew medical problems. It’s incredibly frustrating see.

Sorry ramble I’m feeling so.. really word. Just. Ugh. lo, shall so, Stoners spared thrive! Disease doesn’t stop spreading. report confirms studies kids ten spread disease less others. headline reverses results dumb way. wanna tell said going continue liar? i’ve mild symptoms (nausea, headache, fatigue) days i’m getting tested tomorrow. test takes 6-10 days—should self isolate family get results? really don’t feel sick anything i’m teenager parents 50s really don’t want give them. would really appreciate advice!!  $5 really believe much thought put inaction seeing. party actively engaging moronic behavior getting people killed going punished politically. think party, shall remain nameless mods ban me, going annihilated cycle next one fantasy. black?
He's probably black, right? Im dumbass I'm 3rd year PhD program pharmacology, emphasis bioinformatics. Let know questions. skills relevant ever before... here! taking day trips week wife three year old...keeps us sane. legit don’t come within like 50 yards anyone else. are. bit much times. many horror stories ot enough good ones taxing. 

My wife got psoriatic arthritis 24. watched feet turn balls swollen flesh got biologics. battles chronic pain. draw fight her. strength inspires keep going. 

I wish great luck. Keep fighting. do. New York leads nation deaths... exactly model?

Furthermore, mayor governor encouraged mass protests Yea could give 2 shits summers thinks. everyone problem. Disease stop spreading feelings agree existence.

I curious well would medical personnel started telling things personal problem. closer $3000 month gross now? Jesus christ. family still Ohio. smart things, sensing slowly getting brain washed crazy ideas hoax. know water isn’t best side Lake Erie what’s going on? we've gone full banana Along DSL internet? Aw, sucks. 

/s bullshit. trying get Republicans anything AIDS easy! ""Believe in"" 

WHAT MEAN. cant BELIEVE believe. nothing belief. PURE, OBJECTIVE FACT. Im looking wording closely thinking read right Hes yet ANOTHER tRump tower

Of incompetence 

Stupidity 

And bullshit Probably doctors getting better keeping people alive. lots people left long-term disabilities. even require lung transplants. stories people released 90, 100 days hospital. death rate one small factor, means indicates go party COVID. ***Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho 2020!*** Well might moving Vermont! I'll try say way way get banned again, Deeeee Jay Teeeee Russian agent. assignment kill many Americans possible destroy country. Outside less risky. Huge crowds congregate people released No, actually, last year cut everything except water. quite challenge! might (rarely) make occasional slip up, part able stick it. Without doubt. opinion best practice would semester entirely online. reason rush risk it. Let’s shut much can, get vaccinations rolling, ready safely return Spring. Agreed. But, think factors going too...like air conditioning hvac units. That's example, could several others. anyone change Wikipedia articles, they’re heavily moderated. Go try change something without source anti-maskers know one going enforce shit it. Sad, true website from? realize 7 day trend still up. Numbers fluctuate days. Come back week. Hope it’s going work out, say. “However, source cautioned results, ""extremely promising"", yet prove Oxford vaccine provides long-lasting immunity deadly virus.”

So probably temper enthusiasm bit prepare worst. US means ramping bar openings. Yeah shit, run restaurant lot high schoolers working night shift every time school function sports etc. test far every kid goes school football camp club meetup test positive taken schedule. It’s honestly alarming acknowledging this. OK, accept correction. I'll sure warn really verge vaccine, would much bigger news. I'll believe see it. what! comment still then. bad mod concerned 4th grader going back elementary school. Smaller kids way likely forget touch face mask, fiddle masks &amp; pull down, properly wash hands, get close others, etc. least older kids, capable remembering &amp; executing proper safe practices. really want option continue home learning, Zoom Meetings teacher &amp; classmates. higher risk category different reasons. seem worth risk, even though know misses friends. would devastating lost family member though! kids would bounce back temporary changes, they're young...as long get live.

*Wow! copied send school &amp; found fact offered everyone option! Online traditional. (Just checked email) hope everyone everywhere least given options. Although believe keeping learning home til crisis passed entirely. entirely unfair force teachers unnecessary risky situation. I've idea would keep kids away much less enforce things mentioned. heart goes all. may expert PPE INHALING, make expert anything viral EXHALING. Completely different things. 

Why making shit me, someone know nothing about?

I ran west coast ALFS cable retermination lab (class 100 clean room) well performed audits/inspections gauge instrument lab (class 10 cleanroom).

Do know means?

And again, possibly think hole blowing unfiltered air respirator hole? 

That question need answer. copy advertising swill meant keep people buying products. Products tell use matters whether things escaping mask not. know nagging doubt. know cough year long due digestive issue, every time do, wonder that's it, I've finally caught _it_...

I hope find thing bothers process high false result percent. people know tested false 3 times getting positive result every symptom checklist.

I remember early articles (February-March?) fact test extremely reliable (something like 3% false results, remember whether false positives false negatives), getting samples much harder looked (something like 30% samples received labs unusable). might related.

Of course, procedure may changed since then, data might stale. problem said “the smart thing”

If you’re US, isn’t what’s important WHY?!?! would wrong this? 

Here Brooklyn half people wearing masks one wearing mask eating outside big groups people without masks walk them. Meanwhile, get pushback trolls defending eating outside like ok. Hey, there’s reason we’re supposed wearing masks eating without one doesn’t negate likely good catching transferring virus. incredible selfish dumb. There's post cholesterol drugs also showing promise. Hopefully new treatments low cost widely available continue come out. Cite first requested first comment maybe reasonable conversation.   True. Listen actual scientists. None says something like ""we never going back normal"". I'd happy see day worry parents catching it. follow social media Disney various forums seems mixed bag. lot people go are, course, Disney enthusiasts, lot believe though different magical still nice temporary return normalcy day two. Others, however, felt much changed restrictions go back. read one report family like 7-day trip reserved left two days magical, worried social distancing (some parks worse others, Hollywood Studios seems problematic), wearing masks heat rough, decided worth it. incorrect, pulse oximeter uses light hooks finger. accurate. *meth believe it’s coping mechanism. think get really scared beginning it’s bad thought, they’re mad scared. That’s mantra “if you’re scared, stay home.” Called it. Dude drunk calling death. Happy POS community. tried make Dems look bad deep beliefs. also stay Facebook Twitter. No, PEOPLE need help others moment. virus discriminate, neither you. Selectively helping people based race instead helping people explicitly need plain simple racist. People choose race, deprioritized they're different race you. results damn thing people fighting first place. Guy horrible transphobic views social media. meme'd death. I'm going miss guy, hopefully take many people him. far know zero studies showing numbers. one, please share it. one hamsters I've seen 66% mask, 33% healthy wearer mask 17% healthy infected mask, things halved step.

Good luck Defiance... Stupidity

Potato Potahhhto. somehow highly doubtful. Sep 40 days away. Please prove wrong. different explanation observed? Sound's like eutopia VT!  Neat. Vote people want increase pay benefits workers. mean, bartending job, can't collect unemployment job open. want starve homeless?

He may covid already too. back March, I'm going stay home alone apartment. we've still got humans *choosing* get sick (and die) coronavirus. vaccine development longer (since MERS days) also started phase 3 trials soonest vaccine candidates I'm mistaken. 

They publishing phase 1 results Lancet (which peer reviewed medical journal) tomorrow. team aiming release September say track goal.

All signs point one first available vaccine. bad. meant, source(s) Yeah humans right. worried restaurant begin with... USA catch Chile. Peru Brazil likely push America top ten anyway. No, that’s Florida.
Edit: Texas gets second. problem we’re point people feel comfortable saying anything fake science, tragically going received people need see it. That's simple exercise believing everything read. Face shields $2.50 eBay they’re ones they’re using Covid testing sites typically enjoy vacationing there. Took wife Valentine’s Day. We’ll lucky go back 2022 rate. No, I'm actually not. see, facts (you zero) logical fallacies used. sex every day.

As junior (HS) South Carolina friends going back school fall, I'm really, really hoping best :(  believe AstraZeneca partnered different labs different countries produce vaccine. US lab making 300 million doses one India making Yeah, I'll agree crazy enough go theme park hardest hit state middle global pandemic, Disney one want go to. NY hard hard lockdown early on. Also mostly everyone wearing masks. Let’s start zoom, majority time lectures ineffective didn’t grasp student attention way. indeed fortunate must recognize great minority. people district one laptop average 3 children. skill teaching online greatly lack luster teacher age 35 I’ve seen. say want there’s ways it’s won’t ever equivalent.

No. simple device goes onto finger. Oximeter. blood draw. anyone else surprised learn Alabama schools? makes sense. Thank you.

Can say, annoying thing people say “If see someone wearing mask, kind.” “be kind” mean “keep mouth shut let want.” 

THEY kind, selfish don’t want called it. hypocrisy real. 🙄  Family lineage really “interesting” electorate. someone warned him. Remember newspaper India. 


They tend far positive third world countries pandemic far worse impacts first world countries people need hope. 


India imposed one strictest lockdowns world, look cases death curves. hope teachers that's Faux Flu anti-masker hoaxers.

Treatments save lives bring mortality moot hospitals room production capacity. Again, im quoting study referenced. Chill! moved AZ. last week, ordered 3 bags grandma kettle chips, ones cooked lard. Prior it’s 2 years.

HEAVEN!!!! kinda creepy

It’s watch scream... Karen I’ve never heard actually doesn’t sound like bad idea. That’s helpful clarification, likely cultural best. PA, nearly churches abiding large gathering restrictions whatnot, aren’t seeing here. people using masks right.  Someone owns ad agency get paid. wrong doomers reddit? know, represent demographic.

Are wrong me? Yes. want people refuse wear mask die. would silly. want people understand places like Walmart safe, lying asses appear safe. Stay alert, stay protected, shop elsewhere unless literally options. problem understand seriousness virus overestimated infectivity. hired Johan Giesecke consultant listened him. simply admit wrong time.

Here Giesecke said late March:

""By end May. sure end date, worst may already over.

Former state epidemiologist Johan Giesecke believes rapid spread rapid herd immunity coronavirus, looks hopefully healthcare's opportunities cope virus epidemic.
A large part population immune achieve herd immunity. seem reached Wuhan, already sort facit ship Diamond Princess IFR Giesecke FHM could belive Wuhan reached herd immunity strange. thread: people saying duh kids spread it.

This science. didn’t “know” studies it. multiple studies done show smaller children don’t spread easily counter “booger flinging” filthy little human “common sense” idea spreading like wildfire.

We science make science based decisions whether open schools. (Yes politics problem I’m appalled anyone politics anything it) common was, scoffed (by posts like would sentiment) suggested COVID related. accepted fact is, months people saying enough ""proof"", yet abundance anecdotal evidence ground reports.

I'm much pro data pro science, see trend heading. 2 3 months, reinfection accepted fact. I'm happy set reminder I'm indeed wrong this, really hope am. News Flash: Children Humans!  This.

I many stores, masked there's plenty people wearing masks. company say whatever want media good PR employees stores going enforce jack shit they're afraid might get shot.

This good PR. That's is. need get excited. Move along. change fact lot parents treat school way, even kids sick. Isn’t one simple question? afraid dying covid? say definitely not. even would catch it. Even though taking risk stand close people party. Though mostly getting elderly person infected. know people (also close relatives friends). I’m lucky know anyone died it. So, understand people concerned. risk limited around them. stupid people. One argue sure. definitely massive waste resources. said nobody would bother, meant almost nobody. Obviously always exceptions anything. ""not secret"" part really big factor plausibility program. would say that's less moving goalposts comparing two totally different countries governments. 

It takes already massive cost drives roof. public get away governments much attractive. even work US. president tried run mass surveillance program like would shut house voters next election. 

China nobody can/will stop them. Short starting war making things worse, exactly would stop china's actions? checks place, elections essentially way revolt civil war citizens stop them. Yes, recently Tulane University revealed study shows virus survive indoors air conditioning 16 hours. 

I seen study like indoors heater on, since that's also dry air surprise same.

South/Southwest = bad summer

North/Midwest/Northwest = bad winter in: ice cold! bullshit, horrible job New York. case thanks long convoluted explanation. Based explanation argue fair comparison find new hobby bro. really think making strong point dismissing comparison. never two countries, states, cities make comparison meet criteria ""highly similar."" opinion New York Sweden highly similar. ""Highly similar"" extremely subjective who's qualified say data similar enough, definitely I'm guessing. Btw stop playing smart. dork browsing Reddit weekend pretentious dbag. And, making valid argument waste time. Thankfully parents never see teenagers come home go straight room, locking door behind them. reached tiktok, Animal Crossing, zoom bomb them, right parent.

/s  Thanks. used snapchat feels like million years, really know anything current capabilities. 100%. know want believe SOMETHING bring back humanity truth literally around them. Exactly understand...why earth would spread less? Children even considered super spreaders due high probability asymptomatic. general view. Get shot least probably eliminates one variable problems winter. Many companies insurances pay it. Note infection reducing measure COVID-19 help reduce spread influenza. Pretty much past couple months. willing chalk blunders incompetence, gotten point clear certain Republicans trying destroy system care people all. get voted November, say lock actions. satanic miracle win, people take action own. every medical professional. Perhaps perfect time deal inter-generational injustices. Nothing exemplifies fighting virus like sending infected patients nursing homes.

That brilliant. wise Yes. state Conclusion section study. Arizona fucking train wreck. buddy, literally nurse, coronavirus symptoms quarantine 14 days get tested.


He got results back day 14 better saying yes covid. older severe case would've dead hospitalized coronavirus test came back saying it. state garbage. certainly possible, though deaths per capita NY currently 10x Texas, 8x Florida.

I suspect density NY compared better treatment understanding end NY still higher, though probably 2x.  hope gets super duper sick sick enough intubation wouldn’t want take away someone deserves it. However, wouldn’t object well places blood clots. nasty disease people. Trump cant accept people make mistakes. never admits ever made mistake. hes trying say ""well told us wear masks"" wants accept responsibility says people made mistake. real 1980's business bullshit tactics people use anymore. Trump businessman stepped everyone way up. never served anything sure history serving US. family obviously sick 5G, fake virus... Iiooo OOOOO OK ooo ok ooo ioiooooooook right means you’ll fit here. ;) selfish asshats Canadians believe common good. There's really nothing pisses people trying use ADA want wear mask. First ADA says make reasonable accommodation (hint curbside pickup). Second ADA direct threat defense basically means store accommodate pose health threat. Third all, harming disabled community this. grow wear mask instead acting like adult toddler. Rant over.  always malevolence, it’s fewer steps Foh every illness around long enough humans whole immunity, least semblance immunity. illnesses long term immunity, even all, common contagious diseases viruses do.

That vaccine said illness.

Both create herd immunity... covid-19 neither. It’s also incredibly contagious, normal.

So fucking shit doesn’t work same. area strict criteria reopening schools close surpassing support decision taken open schools also support decision open stay targets

It’s based data. listen public heath officials Blasting course land lords happily evict leave domicile empty months months, rather give renters break ever rent 

Uh, I'm landlord know makes damn bit sense. I'd rather someone paying partial rent sitting empty. still mortgage pay along building maintenance costs. empty apartment help pay rent price drops demand goes shit rentals remain vacant. 

Oh give break. Stop commenting stuff know nothing about. That's works all.

Right there's undersupply housing. major number millions getting evicted, landlord likely accept someone evicted, either let sit empty lower rent/take someone worse credit. scenario mass evictions across country landlords somehow receive consequences it. public freak videos people losing shit masks usually people 35. don’t think it’s young people don’t care. getting parents don’t care job essential business it’s hard get it. face shield instead? knows numbers aren’t looking good. guess decisions based bribes saying FU US giving higher approval.  Trump want give raises dishonest organization 

His entire business political career says otherwise. I'm sure new Post Master General earned $700 million America tax payers $70 million trucking company. bootstraps shit. payment fuck slow mail ballots.

Fuck, know many Trump organizations projects charge fraud sorts dishonesty?! Even ""charities"". There's reason still seen tax returns. 29 14 year old son? century from? certainly true elementary/daycare age children spread less (both study studies looked different ways indicate this), still spread it. headline says, high 

I ""loved"" article (liberal) sister sent 1000 kids California got infected day care. dig underlying study used article, 38,000+ day cares California. Assuming 12 people (prob undercount) day care, that's infection rate 0.2%. “I’ve got access best healthcare planet turned fine! millions unemployed people lost health coverage worried about?” /r/yourjokebutworse Let spice flow No, isn’t obvious. isn’t like gunpowder gunpowder around since ancient china. Coronavirus vaccines around since today. Again, whole point placebo compare results something with. rates going Louisiana, bars opened flocked tourists Florida Texas bars closed.   tried get download vimeo app like ""no ill wing it""

There probably lesson me

Consolation silver rude  course would never hurt force anything, realize getting vaccine could help protect wife kids rest community virus.

When results vaccine trials published would recommend looking comparing risks associated COVID-19. risks way comparable (and would know, vaccines still getting tested many thousands people) wouldn’t get it, highly doubt vaccine would approved. Oklahomans say ""He's representation us! always make us look bad!"" Oklahoman myself, confirm vast majority us fucking morons.

Obviously included, least I'll wear mask public story Bourbons would tell you. Western Cape leading way. 

 pandemic really tough world.

Considering SA 5th articles us. fucking infuriating scroll-through. couldnt even find one comment im top 50ish stopped wasnt batshit insane denier. gg. must one edumacated college types BIG city.

BURN HIM!!! works 5Gs! keep wondering go back old style internet could visit sites, particularly interactive. went view things, conversations. 

I hate stifle communication, seems like internet fertile breeding ground hate disinformation allowed casual use. Maybe would best could talk easily. believe Trump damaging society many people think. 

So part people drank bleach Trump said miracle cure fault? time Trump started hyping hydroxychloroquine magic covid-19 treatment despite fact drug dangerous side effects positive effects covid-19? prognostication virus would gone churches would packed Easter? could go on. hundreds examples. Anecdotes probably.

Guess he's trying explain cases might high black community. refusal efficient pooling insane. Pooled samples absolutely required containment, allow get large number negative results per test, letting test exponentially many people number positives find.

4-pooling ridiculous limit.  Thoughts fucking prayers.  point, studies I’ll need kids disease many done kids around nation weeks. Right now, feels inevitable. I’m ready stories beloved teachers/professors getting sick teaching class class day. won’t surprised stories arise schools literally shut due teachers getting sick. 

Makes wonder schools deadset in-class learning deal scenario like that. Keep throwing substitute teachers? sub gets sick? Throw janitor? principal? Someone’s parent? Give change online learning? Give school resume later month/year? far 

Numbers NY falling apst weeks, numbers everywhere else rising. It'll get much worse places, possibly worse NY picture makes look like alien.  Could real aliens really wearing masks? people need rush white house overthrow them. thing get. know deadly, cause serious illness (potentially long term) die, people may asymptomatic completely. knowing that, knowing spreads easily rapidly, would try protect family. That's important thing.

I get new job. someday fix damage economically. survive cheap food, food banks. roof, food, family safe, I'm pandemic right. Everything else replaceable. loved ones not.

Why everyone feel this? family, own. Florida America's wang. CDC page linked:

""Number deaths reported page total number deaths received coded date analysis represent deaths occurred period. Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week **8 weeks more**, depending jurisdiction cause death.""

So data less 8 weeks (56 days) old incomplete subject change. Bahahahahah even think glorious voluntary contributions via social media. Touché! ... triggered people may even know infected . . .

You mean like. . . clueless? like sample size question polls. 2,000 people get margin error 2% 95% confidence. 9,000 gets margin error 1% confidence (which scientific standard). diminishing returns increasing sample size, reason poll test 30,000 people money limited better spent elsewhere. Bruh lmao Brave browser (Firefox good enough though).

Not sure platforms sadly. Everything’s get data. hope get it. prefer reference Green Day, can't argue accuracy. Well, count one hand amount times I’ve read “reinfection.” every one cases I’ve looked I’ve heard thing — viral RNA fragment remnants trigger positive actually infectious. no, cannot “certain,” I’ll go overwhelming data contrary, 15 million confirmed cases, I’ve read approximately 4 reports “reinfection.” Lol what, talking weed, blow champ. virus, knowledge constantly evolving. I'm liberal going ""children spread less"". best data time. days ago, modified ""children 9 spread less"". better strong opinion that's based nothing feeling. want afford food shelter work.

Money unfortunately necessary survival. mean, point people probably feeling things result virus, job, seeing friends, flip side working nonstop around fucking assholes yell face freedom. joke post =\ click link see $15 could used 100 times! paid Etsy masks. 

They setting company need FDA approval. read today FDA approvals going record pace. 

This promising although perhaps imminent. PCR antigen tests non-zero false negative rate. usually much higher (5-10%) antigen tests though. veil lifted US. politicians longer need fake good, held accountable anymore. pushed pushed boundaries years, found level evil enough change tribalism US. Republican base lower level education exposure world, plays right it. 1/4 nations COVID deaths happened New York. 3x amount deaths Texas. New York run murders crime. Innocent children bystanders dying violence poor policy decisions government. New York banning every single gather aside Blm riots. Wtf. New York absolute nightmare right now. Finally, good fucking news! Rural Oregon largely ignoring precautions COVID. large church gathering led huge spread eastern Oregon became r/leopardsatemyface moment. 

They warned Governor Brown trying help them, get mad restrictions. Mass graves due overflowing morgues correct way dealing this? Okay ;) Great job New York! put infected people senior citizens higher death rate countries world! Keep up! Every day takes actions fully knowing result dead Americans.

And everyone collectively decided allow it. directly responsible death toll is. we're letting it. We've decided wait 2021 let watch virus tear country next half-year. fuck America sound like china Moron shocked moronic action leads moronic result “F”ink stupid. understand people love him. .. fear friend. fearful. Fear push stay inside, away people wear mask. .. may save life.

There reason fear exists. Evolution gave us fear ... result ""survival fittest"". Quick somebody call Guinness World Records... JK... Sorry failing non USA redditors. voting there’s difference voting guy doesn’t know exist vs one that’s hitting balls hammer Spray air freshener Meanwhile Texas great hope helps understand mean wait two weeks. 100,000 people died. countries around world minimized death totals gotten back semblance normal life. Yet continue fail. Florida failing. wait two weeks see right now.

There plenty countries 1/10 per capita death rate handful cases, we're increasing. 

We wait two weeks. failed. really didn’t check, suggest mom take different doctor specifically check vein. fake. It’s girl mask. mask got back Taco Surf Surfside couple tables got masks. Fuck you. die \*and\* I'm going infect anyone else.

\*You\* may things. Hey! statistically small number people managed, odds incredible amount luck, overcome systemic poverty bigotry achieve wealth material success, could it, totally fair hold everybody standard can't also it, deserve basic amenities life despite manual labor essential work necessary keep top comfortable rich. even. He’s got symptoms eyes solidified Covid real problem. They’re giving vaccine 15k people placebo 15k. Everyone told go live lives normally (still social distance, wear mask, etc).

So happens none 15k people, got actual vaccine, contract virus exposure (they properly social distance wear mask enough exposed)? confirm vaccine working vs people exposed? Dr. bewildered public care survived Covid. Amazing Formula 1's entire circus running two weeks thousands tests weekend whilst every traditional American sport can't even get two teams play other. think strategy relied ot testing much compliant populace falling apart. probably they'd follow scientific advice rather stuff dropout uncle posted facebook. Tell me, many countries got first hundred coronavirus cases land transport, opposed sea transport air transport. That's good point. really case become visible next year. seen dark side. Thank you, informative good points :)

Edit: let's forget, death price pay contracting virus. may ultimate price, short term effects well potential long term effects, yet pknow full extent of. 7-10 days behind Italy. Yeah, screwed, got hit hard little known virus, public taking seriously either. south whole stratosphere incompetence denial , continuous willful. That’s pretty big assumption.

Yes...because everyone vulnerable dead VT strong wear mask I'm going vacation!""


-Floridians Blackjack dealer here, 100% agree million healthy people take 99% accurate test twice, 100 test positive twice. Amazing.

Ignore/ Deny problem, get sick, end hospital, receive priority treatment, drugs become unavailable, indirectly responsible death someone fact careful unlucky. Nice. 

Nice one USA. 

Fucking disgusting. vaccine never comes around? secret election already guaranteed win vis fixing interference that’s he’s he’s doing? generarions reason care pandemic? buy blanket simplification moment. likely young people acting irresponsibly venues inhabit remain open due inept leadership local, state federal level.  what’s called syllogism, it’s form logical reasoning, probably wouldn’t understand Prayers positive vibes coming way!!! think point, mean say wrong factors, addressing term rural.

I live year large town/small city western Kentucky. downtown pretty rundown, folks seemed live huge farmland areas outer part county. 

This personal experience, thing struck different that, Kentucky, many fewer shops businesses (since much area farmland) relatively ended waaaay crowded given day similar place VT would be. maybe that's part it? dunno, lot younger could 100% talking outta ass tbh  knows voted vindictive way screwing American people. handling virus bad point explained malice, incompetence  Heroes March/April, antagonists May/June/July. Arizona's usual daily death toll (irrespective ""crisis"")? folk oughta get downvoted idiotic, facile idea rural what's protecting us virus.

we safe. going ravage us, sooner later. Oooh even realize. winters lack jobs keep people away. get wrong. Vermont rocks. lacks several key aspects drive people coming cities/states. Third wave? happened second wave? sort ""masks"" talking here? appear double (or even triple) meaning! Looking back Italy’s numbers, reached 10,000 total cases March vast majority cases north. NY 7-10 days look Italy prepare, president openly dismissed threat offered next zero federal assistance. 

By contrast, southern states witnessed far worse outbreak country, 3 months prepare, implemented weak lockdowns reopened despite meeting CDC protocols. 

There equivalent. Whatabout New York false comparison. Ha. Looks type. like vermont's population density. ton people around, fucking depopulated like western parts country. 

and obviously there's nothing wrong local businesses &amp; sustainability lol. city boy can't grow tomato? teach, unions illegal striking/quoting cause lose license absolutely would. I’m counting people stick us I’ve hope ever despite loud bashing teachers, news actually reporting facts actually control educational system, funding, function - I’m seeing people listening! It’s relief. need help. tired, haha. remember 3000. said myself, omg, another 911! 

I'm numb now. numbers. can't process real people anymore. Sad could always go back sub later extra money teach again. Schools always looking good subs. 20 years rarely known trivia ""hindsight 2020"" *actually* gets origins eyesight tests. Waiting time finally say
That wonderful I'm way
But think time leave covid behind
I try find way there's nothing say make stop must Phish Food ice cream flavor comes from? didn’t wish anything, simply stated governor would begin fear virus one kids ended ER. 

And still don’t understand long term effects disease. Needlessly subjecting kids possibility lifelong debilitation moronic article says specifically moving filter placement receiving feedback make easier patients see healthcare worker's face. Americans ones shove bullshit throat most. ones make kids swear fealty flag every day like sort regime.

Other countries even half much America, funny watch image they're trying convince everyone (no one ever believed way) fall apart Highly educated folks also tend critical strong executive brain function. Highly educated folk type (or shouldn't) believe everything read hear. Besides Wyoming least populated state entire country. Can't pandemic know catches it! you’re looking something different Oregon may disappointed. I’m sure Oregon live grew Vermont I’ve spent lot time Oregon (Ashland Portland mostly). I’ve always thought incredibly similar, terms landscape culture.

For record say good thing, really like places. mean pay $2.25 order much much greater magnitude protection whenever go out, vs using current home made mask?

That sounds like absolute bargain. one said reason Vermont better they're rural. 

I'm saying anyone's said that. eyes, see ""rural"" mentioned damn near every top They're saying helps addition population better educated, likely follow health guidelines, better health system, etc. course population centers factor.

yeah, reason i've got bug ass false sense security. abso-fucking-lute worst thing get ego, tell we're safer we're smarter, writing's wall: we're heading disaster fall, tourists come, schools open, still mask mandate. 

this whole thread like US patting back italy got ravaged. going get here, too. already here, really. going get *a lot* worse.  Freedom Breath Agency.......that fucking creative thing could come with? love everything holy haha.

Oh...The DOJ logo too, that's assume hospitals won’t take $1 turn $1,000. seen price bandaid? Californian, see rest country way. so? even coders literally people making videos know algorithm pick many crazy videos youtube aimed kids still does, likes winning that's sure. think really showed everyone country still runs OK even without competent leader. times crisis. point mostly conspiracy theories trying deflect. real metric point anymore, hoaxes antidotes real impact. cling anything can. Everything done perfectly one person ever misdiagnosed, everything lie spreads everywhere far right websites. Happy cake day! entire shit show over, going want nurse teacher?

It shows lip-service praising teachers nurses that, empty lip-service actual care. Trying appease society continues abuse exploit compassion.

Just like troops sent hot-zones without body-armor. Weekend data garbage states. use worldometer stats page use 7-day average display graph, clearly see 7-day frequency variation. Numbers “down”over weekends general. W. T. A. F. Why? Wherever ""mask mandate"", signifies location American free place law-abiding citizenry.

So, states, cities countries ""mask mandates""?  truly believe want reelected, everything sabotage it. Everyone convinced wants win. think wants see much shit get away leaves office. 

I even think wanted president first place. Germany. think even catch it, think chance almost existing, harm them, since young healthy. bit ill that's it. believe, older people die suffer consequences.

It unreal ignorant are.  Reminds years ago Louisiana Governors election. KKK grand wizard vs convicted felon. Bumper stickers around town “Vote Crook”. did. 2020: Exposing stupidity selfhisness. I've always stressed deaths per capita pretty meaningless total population actually becomes bound cases/deaths.

You can't spontaneously develop COVID like cancer, get someone it, absolute numbers matter per capita numbers. DeSatan 

DeSanitize

DeSpicable

DeStructive

Oh yeah nickname list keeps growing fellas

p.s live Florida smh Well then, spread complacency? I'm looking comment. top comments thread cite ruralness reason Vermont's well.

and, frankly, deserve praise. we're going get brutalized fall. whole suck-off thread like trump patting back italy late march. also strong third party, Vermont Progressive Party. I'm interested - many people die day Vermont regardless (because people die everyday around world whatever reason remember)? 50 people die yesterday Vermont? 100? Actually, (else recover). real question whether one become re-infectious observed occur.

Live science, die science. See social media. People care till (or someone care about) get work airport Burlington. got asked someone today one states wear mask. Uhh yes, yes is. People need start seeing this.

The media needs start putting active patients front center finding ways convince allow footage there. needs become real. Haha. Dotard. Haha exactly, barely anything left pay monthly (veryyyy minimal) bills spend groceries. thanks [Largest average lot size Vermont issues too. happened opening back up.

Apparently one issue security guards quarantine buildings sex people quarantine.

Good luck. need bit atm VT- important .. bring brain powers rest us suffering haphazard fools GA, FL, TX, AZ, etc etc. Cleary real intellectual fairly rural, sure. need tell that. I've lived one rural counties life. know what? I'm still close enough someone, right now, I'm getting pissed late night fireworks scaring dog. can't drive 5 minutes anywhere without passing another person house. There's always someone walking around town. There's always another car road. always *people* around, even I'm literally living downtown Manhattan. Manhattan mean middle-of-nowhere Wyoming. dichotomy making head spin.

Our rural ***NOTHING*** like ""rural"" Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Alaska, etc. That's fucking fact. what's protecting us covid19. that's mind went it, says lot you. Unfortunately it’s looking virus similar HIV it, forever. God knows future. Huge chance shut immune system like AIDS. 6 fig salary (with 4 weeks annual leave, 2 weeks annually accrued personal/sick leave) employer based 12% super contribution, last financial years tax paid 26c dollar tax (that included 1.5% Medicare levy earn 85k).

Why, pay?

Edit; oh annual payment local Ambulance Victoria - $85 covers whole family Ambulance trip (including air ambulance). Normal ambulance covered public health costs private health. long indoor bars, restaurants, gyms closed, sounds like y’all going okay then.

In liberal areas lots people freaking people walking sidewalk sitting park without masks. that’s causing problem FL/TX/AZ/etc. states life looks like pre-covid, it’s nuts. 1. recent wave started young adults, likely survive. Average upon diagnosis age full 10 years younger before. already changing group infects vulnerable people

2. Faster, accessible tests mean people know positive earlier illness, meaning lag cases deaths greater before. Unfortunately sharp increase deaths expected thought hoax before, believe it’s real virus post. douche-canoe douche-nozzle? Oh florida memes? Well, 63 cases, cross immunity seems doubtful. Sounds like smarter, organized, efficient countries like U.S. smoke joint this? still air whether get twice? shit. bears shit pope’s hat woods? hope got expression correctly. end day shut hurts poor people most. idea long recover? know probably millennial know much life business really hurt country. millions people dying course would say shut millions aren't. July?  Military 100% get first test subjects. matter level job always team effort. Always appreciate everyone evenly. took hand... He's stupid. indeed much much worse Inject sweet succulent nectar. body ready. sure singling NY point.

Is product already ways testing simply repurposed COVID-19? Thats like 10 years pandemic time :/ group first line, sure. needs n95 better

A simple surgical mask would suffice. everyone Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam N95 yet they’ve crushed virus simply 95%+ compliance Weren’t cases coronavirus attacking T-cells though? remember two months ago people saying like HIV something. Lol talking about? close 1-3% entire country's population dead? I'm almost sorry replied you, that's literally insane. What's wrong fine millions people dying make rich fucks extra bucks? I'm shocked! Shocked tell you! Can't wait anti-mask people make switch anti-vaccine... Yea...the science guys/gals /r/covid19 argued articles. 350k cases handled wholly overwhelmed medical system FL someone bitching misclassification? 

Where put world's tiniest violin...I must play... Sadly 2020 think you’ll qualify statement /s somebody think you’re serious. keep safe. one needs yell anything rooftops follow crowd order so. every healthcare worker, member military, politician, essential worker, government worker.

So... February? Maybe? Hopefully peddled President like ""cure"". real men it. Agreed. pointlessly aggressive automod I've ever encountered sub. Normally I'd ask mod anything better do, really apply bot lol Freedumb! People virus asymptomatic spread dudes could making people sick.

I never hopeful future. Gotta love country! God Bless USA! /s state. definitely ones epicenter now. thing is. rushed, cutting unnecessary red tape safely trials rushed. besides oxford one based mers vaccine 5 years testing behind it. could see become available oct, least healthcare workers.

the reason take long time, go though phase, bc take awhile gather volunteers, approval trials whatnot, bc they're studying data years. Ah yes. Depression weakness, personal failing.

Sadly, ludicrously naive. one sell's mortuary trucks, see problem is. Imagine 14 year old finding brought illness gave 10 kids class, kids parents get mom dies. real scenario would happen world start sending kids back willy nilly. Obviously 3rd world country starting feel like one, dictators charge, care regard people, ""do whatever fuck want dime"" kinda attitude fucking 'leaders'

Also yeah really third world country places across America, running water, living slum huts paycheck paycheck, 3rd world west think Fauci may stated outright. People spend time other. surprised. numbers reported Sunday; cases deaths Sunday perhaps Saturday.  already decided go, ask?  theory, trials go well, could start seeing deployed targeted ways August. hasn’t seen early, intense ramp-up efforts vaccines have, slow, steady increase availability throughout rest year. Wow really

What area? It’s baseless, agree, it’s possible Covid. think assuming COVID also irresponsible right now. symptoms could attributed diseases well negative test. Yes, know false negatives happen. 

They’re going autopsy answered then. body going check back autopsy results.

Yeah, knew coming. Agreed. article mentions nothing symptoms. doctor experiencing significant symptoms due supposed reinfection, doubt detail would omitted article. get frustrating everyone dogpile country ways strictly fair.

I'm UK press comparing us city-sized countries letting Spain get away less making figures. go. Gotta sell papers. What's amount paid sick leave, much need? know working alongside parents run sick leave using kids (because parent take work kid stays home school sick, got multiple kids actually follow school policy staying home well 24 hours burning relatively common two weeks fairly quickly), come work sick themselves. know US companies officially unlimited sick even vacation time (and even unofficially frowned upon use it). That’s real human spirit right fair, national guard also emergency support, defense. life line within US times crisis trained variety non combative roles, well traditional training.

Sadly, time now. disease surging across Rural America - south particular newest hotspot; Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas Florida. weeks, hospitalizations catch new infection rates - rural hospitals overrun, death rate likely explode. “Surge 1” might nothing compared 60 days....

I pray COVID miraculously go away like president said would. 🙏🏻 I’m ma, we’re taking seriously. I’m proud thankful god born here. Even trump people wearing masks Infecting people would violation sabbath factual nformation provided CDC directly contradict lies spun Donald cronies. coincidence. Bruh That's something Bangladesh, Vietnam et Al need address. also misled think Cubans can't buy buying Nike products.

Also money relative. worker China making $1000 month much better life someone USA making $2000 month. I'm sorry seemed ranting you, intent all. way. understood saying people pushing put kids school, advice medical experts, using ""but little kids spread it"" argument. 

I trying point seem credible evidence small children spread covid. pisses see covid deniers using sketchy data, basically anecdotal scientific all, support political agenda ""Ignorance Bliss"".

As far feelings, links articles referencing ""studies"" found, judge whether seem exhaustive scientifically It’s pointless you’re trying train children enter work world unlikely get paid sick leave or, do, employers would much prefer don’t use it. spend formative years learning staying home they’re ill good thing, something rewarded (with meaningless awards value, also handy thing train people accept compensation work place.) It’s like sort dystopian nightmare

Where live attendance awards don’t exist. outsider looking much seems like yet another absurd system America setup benefit government and/or rich business owners lieu something would actually benefit normal people. That's easy. Many Americans care believe. Im still curious dont see that. watched horrific videos china started havent seen pictures videos morgues hospitals overwhelmed videos people dying doctors freaking out. see almost nothing news numbers stories... Lol happens forget sarcasm disclaimer. vast majority are, credit debt lowest since 2011. People paying things holding money, saying ""oPeN EcOnOmY"" make sense. Absolutely. due respect, people outside education understand realities classroom. appreciate people looking solutions, say realistic, believe us. Well, clear present danger?  hope same, sake hope believe same. 10/10 Wendy Byrde pushed Every individual death made news adults first, too. feel like school openings going give us lot information happens children. kids probably large gatherings kids rooms day several months. selective quoting comment? clearly wrote lucky **and** making good life choices. Two things: luck good life choices. 

There people might made good life choices unlucky. people right made shitty life choices. pretend nobody suffering made shitty life choices? read comment open localized lockdowns outbreak (trying appease ones anti lockdown leaving options open like good politician) I've saying every day.

Countries universal health care much trouble COVID-19 compadres US. We're set surgeons, drug companies, medical supply companies bro maximum profits.

We set healthy.

We paying premium prices terrible service. makes sense economically, incentives chronically ill population. 

Nixon fucked us healthcare legacy. idea supposed people would incentive use medical care system lightly. turns early prevention fuck lot cheaper treatment, companies sell treatment money buy regulatory capture lobby aggressively system would foster better health cut profits margins. one options discussed Newsom stepped in. Good luck, model enough convince safe Democrats make Trump look bad

Trump makes look bad. need Democrats help so. Close friend moved there. Sold 2 BR NYC apt, bought house 7 acres stream. 

It sure pretty, Confederate flags, 40 minute drive nearest hospital, pay live there. pretty sure article posted here. contact tracing even possible point?

Crazy think established virus likes rest Sundays? Technically vacate office Jan 2021. Giving time even damage he's done. SARS fizzled quickly unable level clinical testing needed pass vaccine. basically disappeared, need vaccine.  case virus. 


My mental health already taken huge hit. vaccine one things keeping going point. Wait ball drops midnight December 31st instead 2021 popping says 2020 2. Well, seeing Vermont exactly 56 confirmed deaths... frugal netherlands? /s article actually says “in case” they’re needed, headline doesn’t highlight. Still, fact they’re preparing need good sign shit’s gone wrong. mom dad work? business worked closed, something happening? Yeah - wonder separate regions could hold school different times year. Canada, weather lovely May-November. even gets cold, bars patios would give guests blankets turn heat lamps outside- could use open air tents invest heating - get creative. Southern States could hold school colder months avoid heat. would Saturday numbers no? Sunday happened yet. Hopefully even conservative friends stopped posting trump nonsense Yea. live Quebec, Canada even though numbers went low amounts, right 2 week holiday (known Construction holiday, whole construction industry pauses) doubled mandated mask use indoor areas, gatherings public transport. Holidays super spreading events results predictable. reading post, agreeing, realized really need fix Recall question. official anywhere cannot recalled. think also important point number countries never make list, least over. Iran, India Russia listed. i'm sure enough 3rd world countries going releasing numbers makes list less relevant. *I* sound stupid? pointing getting tested bearing whether someone sick go hospital? you, kind stable genius? I'm happy happening city Thank too.

Stay safe friend I'm great man thanks asking ""Than"" Well, you’re leaving I’m going stay fight country. people are, every public polling measure, minority voices country. They’re spotlighted, amplified, platformed normalized media, social media, politicians electoral suppression look like “default” country, they’re - they’re ones given disproportionate amount power systems. 

And subreddit places like r/politics part enabling system endlessly gawking people enabling circus.

In middle Trump administration, managed see unimaginable strides fight police abolition, changes never thought I’d see lifetime. Trump administration.

When feel powerless alone, that’s systemic order trying make voices isolated.

I mean, really, put shoes gay man 1978-1992 imagine political realities face. 

Just walking away very, very, privileged mentality take quite people can’t leave mean need emergency room generally position calling ahead lmao wtf

Yeah, like people either call 911 someone call 911 behalf....calling emergency rooms ahead totally unheard /s Thats really good news    error initial comment! I’m totally agreement you. It’s absolutely absurd receive mass emails administrators following “why aren’t getting bites?” Well exact reason actual staff doesn’t want come back. happens pandemic driven science facts instead driven rambling orange lunatic/sadist smh  Michigan, Missouri... Totally agree. many ppl ignorant reckless :/ anyone going come back check this? Doubt it. think really American thing point. I've basically lost faith liberals, conservatives, everyone general. 

And think. could Yang. Google cares money much else. Chile surpassed USA, you’re wrong there.

USA likely catch France, doesn’t change point all. Europeans getting congratulatory badge different New York getting one... remember isn’t over. one woods. It’s almost preordianed. sizable minority, majority, get endorphin rushes drama goes here. positive step welcome. UV light kills microbes, coronavirus included. There’s multiple studies showing link vitamin deficiency &amp; worse case outcomes, nothing conclusive; it’s likely background factor (like vitamin C) helps body recover better, otherwise preventative curative effect.  Yes. assumes hiccups like Ade. Tbh past week I've noticed 10% people wearing masks places like Walmart, Walgreens, etc. Went home depot week least 60% wearing them. know many people think nothing worry MS residents still really part can't say expected much. interesting idea never going happen. combination Muh Freedumb, financial hits atrocious leadership would stop it.

It's stupid America's size strength. government coordinating moving resources areas virus disappearing gaining ground. Instead, lovely capitalistic way, every state themselves. Huh? Source what. mean news watching aspect that's pretty obvious said countless times pretty much anywhere even here, even J Stewart others shows. people home day watching hours news non stop. Don’t think so. one hyped mostly stay are. Hamptons space greenery you’re wealthy LA home already that. There’s desire escape density sense.  remember school 

you're assuming taught school. people represent wages. reddit way pandemic would never end could free UBI everyone Cackle away want deliberately obtuse put fucking thing stupid little face. cells produce antibodies. I'll believe see it; hope vaccine. seriously, 54 families? sample 54, parents go children? 

come on...

Let ask you, schools reopen int scientific advice, obtained Guardian, says effective reproduction rate epidemic less one Netherlands since 15 March. means one person disease infects fewer one person place low transmission virus int eh first place, people go (i.e. store get food) young children alone, without parents. COURSE young children likely one brought virus home family. Life already turned semi normal me. Minus masks. exactly state NY handling virus well? Taking reopening seriously people wearing masks places? sound like amazing teacher! Good luck! Well hope doesn’t happen day found lol  even jewelry, know alterations place, pet store, gas station, bike shop locked door doorbell work back people come store unannounced well getting good shot camera door opened. I've always understood exactly done I've never thought negatively it, anything seemed well thought secure. Settle Reggie allowed? It’s always allowed wear mask. There’s need mandated encouraged covid, bad idea people actively sick, like said. Otherwise drawbacks far far outweigh benefits. People like need stop trying contribute conversation willfully misrepresent sources make point.

No one's impressed edgy cynical contrarian. Except they've got people starving there's that. Right there’s gas station fire someone needs turn pumps. governor saying essentially “we’ve got really good firefighters incoming, let’s hold shutting pumps bit longer.” citizens Texas nodding heads. you’d better pray get universal healthcare whole debacle. Bruh dumb af. Well, talking nonsense. No, one needs help moment.  vaccine available vulnerable healthcare workers, military first, frontline workers finally everyone, yearlong approach provide vaccines 70+% population. However third phase success shouldn’t roll back reopening phase anymore. Hopefully it’s like flu vaccine it’s preventing dangerous strains covid. One study says covid dangerous strains 10x likely cause severe symptoms hope vaccine target those. money. comes money. would imagine differences opinion COVID related precautions major factor well. Leadership send place without type real unifying message leaving lot speculation there. wife one biggest fights ever whether send daughter small daycare summer. something would ever argued before. either us taking seriously either, we're mostly page. could imagine couples major differences opinion. Hopefully nasal version follow suit pretty quickly.... I'd really happy see vaccine then, I'd anyone else wondering long protection lasts? Antibodies fade sometimes within three months. Would need quarterly booster shots?

Some protection better none, I'd like see get vaccine protection 12 weeks. vaccine partially protective, keep mind prevent spread. 

I want wet blanket, impossible they'd know long lasts point, effective months. Disney pretty robust system dealing troublemakers. major function schools - childcare. families “using” schools “day care” well academic education socialization decades. Especially households require two incomes survive US, access low cost childcare. fact, schools after-school programs parents pick child end workday instead end classes.

But second point, yes wouldn’t surprised people sent kids school sick, though hopefully parents cautious usual. coworker admitted frequently dosing toddler Tylenol right school ran fever night temp would enough might get call high temp end workday. likely infected every kid class whatever virus had. got limited time husband’s job male-heavy policies made impossible call child sick. left mothers sacrifice careers PTO. Unfairness around. worry too. god-forbid loses November he's going pump brakes let country suffer. Thank you. went back get tested second time, changed lot things. lot reports people's tests lost, results, lot errors process.

This time, instead looking DL writing down, write sheet paper, verify, use sticker maker print double check.

The first time gave website check foe results, time gave paper said would call within x amount days, notified within time, two websites, one email, phone number contact.

The thing bothers process high false result percent. people know tested false 3 times getting positive result every symptom checklist.

I've taking care guy who's sick (awaiting results), feeling kind crummy know cold covid point. Ordered groceries intsacart yesterday drop door. I'm going take chances try keep everyone else safe.

We still know could've gotten did; gone public places, grocery shop separately (one other) need wear masks/use sanitizer wipe everything (door handle, keys, credit card). use cash. wipe groceries get rid bags.


I'm sure still possible catch - regular masks disposable type ones either left somewhere.

I feel safe using sides open, I'm worried one us may gone grocery used one those. That's explanation come with.


We may come something normal, one things back head - every yawn, sneeze etc think it. leadership Americans look for! test positive 14 days go hospital think recovered? thought least need negative test.. Yeah... Black brown communities disproportionately affected white communities. isn’t saying white people don’t need help. It’s giving directly communities overwhelmingly need help. sons! also keep windows wide open day. sure much probably can’t hurt. that's usually there's clear winner election point mailed ballots make dent. testing children April May Netherlands? Agreed

But seems reasonable assume school staff put highest risk. 

Teachers always feel frame every argument around what's best kids situation work. 

School staff (probably) danger kids. make sure districts right thing. tried make rhetoric point, namely lowest mortality rate zero deaths countries that. formulated indirectly want another post removed Automoderator. literally ""alternative graduation"" last week town. fucking bizarre, graduation last thing I'd cared cancelled senior year. I'll also right eventually say everyone's going die. keep printing money without addressing underlying issue, going put hole wont climb generation.

This much complex keeping money flowing. friend friend rather mild illness back March. collapsed going run brain dead hospital. healthy underlying conditions illness, 38 years old. Probably kinda like happened [this belgian 20 year old amateur Damn. borderline terrifying. 250k worse worse case saw assuming people bare minimum poor compliance. said that's grim revised 140k looked like people taking precautions 90k lockdowns happened 

Now half year, 140k. new lockdowns winter coming, 300k would bet Deja vu.
Didn't already different (american) vaccine months back? anti-maskers also anti-vaxers? matter vaccine people get it..... Bill Gates invented super AIDS going inject children make super gay /s (HATE put /s sentence someone writes sort seriousness). clearly haven’t read source provided I’ll spell you. 

Children 1,3% total infections 20,7% population.

In June (with open schools) 16500 children 1-12 tested, 0,3% positive. 4800 children 13-18 tested, 1,4% positive. 54 infected families followed April, 0% source child 12. spread less environment adults go work previously, kids going back school. Moreover, testing children much. 

Again, bogus.   ...

During Black Plague, customary accuse Jews poisoning pits.

So... maybe take pinch salt. forget rumors kill.

**edit** Clarified. closed March, didn’t go anywhere work opened back mid June. feel like 3 months absolute waste time. Disney open upon seeing safety measures they've taken, severely limiting park capacity, strictly enforcing masks, adding physical barriers rides, spraying disinfectant every rider, I'm convinced they're going safely. 

That said, I'm still concerned people traveling state Disney plane. Cite points please

Got feeling wont replying back topic locked, hey atleast tried. first point isnt even President talking about. U.S. conducted COVID-19 tests country. However, expert consensus recommended target raw number tests even rate tests per capita – graph demonstrates using statistics alone misleading.   Yep. seem recall recent study double layer cotton, well-fitted, 90% reduction inbound. course details matter, that's pretty dang good news. “Being immune doesn’t last herd immunity doesn’t work!!!”

So tired partial science I'm working new theories.

1. Obviously lockdown delayed hit coronavirus country. saw charts showed curve flattened...to right...of page curve starting back lockdown ended.
2. People areas hit, general think like cold conspiracy theory. Pennsylvania, cases hitting around 1000...the Governor imposed restrictions. Almost universally, see post county 150-200 new cases, people talk warrant action Governor did.
3. areas hit really hard, people want lockdown generally. But, exponential growth, ICU's filled, late.
4. Part discussion schools opening Fall essentially serve babysitter kids. Locking schools puts parents tough spot, especially return work.
5. Higher Ed (colleges) face similar conundrum. lot bad shape financially covid, they're worse. Instead focusing hw make online classes good possible, they're buying plexiglass trying figure open person.
6. fee like south hit hard hot people indoors 6 feet social distancing may enough. Also, air conditioning may blow virus around large areas. doubt people South totally negligent. factors play, know northern states people lax habits too...and infections bad South. I'm correct, Fall really bad North.  Sorry didnt realize missed signature. worries. going Newsweek headline 3 weeks. Wow. sure kids school. Im luckily KY though much better TN. Texas populated led dumbest people face earth. No, claimed quarantining refused sign paper saying would quarantine they'd contact health department break quarantine. dipshits wasting public resources public keep safe.  We're running Darwin Awards. Yeah one come September, people won’t see December. first months, order priority, Healthcare, Essential Workers, Politicians get it. everyone else based random lottery, depending much available given time. Could mean open everything slightly earlier UK? Sounds bit selfish due married mid August would really want reception 30 people. get good results tomorrow chance could see people allowed? Especially seeing schools also opening two weeks later. currently working retail NC. I’m glad workplace one places still closed now, dread day reopen. Thanks reacting like reasonably kind human. always wondered bc used thing worke automation company. good lord.. OSHA that.. dude. actually feel kind relieved now.  deliberately obtuse enjoy putting words people's mouths?? ""proposing scenario"" here, telling pandemic community spread works collaborative tools online facilitate small group interactions (ZOOM, instance, feature assign students smaller breakout rooms.) able get live, interactive help Teacher online, too, right. fortunate taught campus heavily digitally integrated pandemic. students laptops, paper assignments discouraged, received ongoing training effective use technology. classes went remote stronger position meet demand.

I would never put blame high school students. job teachers meet needs, period. I'm saying digital teaching skill. skill lot teachers lacked March, especially. skilled year, either. large percentage peers spent summer working hard get better. focus entire academic community issue. learning curve fast furious. awful. Poor kid. think countries continue faith dollar keep printing plan stop deal underlying issue?

That trouble. Everyone thinks special always be. change course soon, end empire looks like. thought apparently people trial similar behaviour patterns - eg mainly health care workers similar days - around 30 40 people enough make results statistically significant.

*And I'm sure multiple tests make sure results false +/- Lol look upset old us acquaintance online lockdown, argued jobs equally vital unfair pick choose.

Now radio silence read opinions treat “research”? 

It's this. People lot trouble differentiating scientific articles opinion pieces, especially there's quote (usually context) doctor. well social distancing fact article even thing fucking disgraceful. thought Oxford mRNA Actually “the federal government giving fuck” politicised pandemic 😣 Inpatient hospitalizations want watch. I'll get soooooo drunk compensate accumulated anxiety 
seriously, liver work double-shifts week  halfmasks I've used made silicone. wash mine hot soapy water gets grubby. It'd probably survive oven I'm sure that's necessary. vaccines decrease effectiveness elderly think 25 persons upvoted probably supports us Bigot implies hes racist towards Chinese people, people problem. CCP (Chinese communist party) absolute snakes especially erratic past year particularly. Hong kong, constant information jacking, suppression speech places right enforce things, use concentration camps torture certain Muslims, waving dick around American/Worldwide media. Theyre really pushing luck. love people attach “reinfection” story say fucked. It’s quite humorous actually. Usually type people storm thread decent good news treatments vaccines say “we need research.”

You know, need research reinfection claims, would seeing fuck load reinfections stage actually thing. Instead “reinfection” news worthy tells isn’t common. He's commiting genocide American people.

No fucking way that? never successful corona virus vaccine, scares me. but, don’t know could trust vaccine rushed existence. People trying downplay virus prefer assume evidence isn’t available (wasn’t collected), best case scenario could assumed. Someone arguing ago everything still closed daycares safe weren’t outbreaks them, 1) daycares closed, 2) testing unlikely point children unlikely sick enough tested, 3) actually two outbreaks noted US/Canada daycares kids essential workers knowing doesn’t mean didn’t happen Time tell. That's exactly people said response children, happening everywhere find outbreaks. Happy Cake Day! comment come prefer Reddit Facebook. see comments like numerous times day state's health dept posts. Rural areas hot spot states getting hammered. It’s likely VTers followed mandates closely, still part.

I live tourist zone VT spot people CT, NY wear masks social distance. People VT social distancing forever though, that’s cultural here. basic respect like give everyone wide berth possible Covid ever came along. all. Seriously walks life. doesn’t matter support wearing mask hard people yet used it. lot people dont it’s uncomfortable. also large number young adults infected. bars opened free all. beach packed people parting towel jumping. It’s different go beach keeping selves. kinda nuts continue wear mine order. worth it. two tests negative. Due possible contact.  moved goalposts, buddy. ""massive waste resources, nobody would bother"" ""china benefits secret""  another upvote BSG reference! People like Rick Desantis, Trump, Mitch McConnell others fucking enemy. 2021, 2020 part 2: Saga Continues Right? feel bad dudes kids... (Assuming any) comment age well lol buy it. statistics show deaths everything else way down. Almost people dying elderly already near death. would dying anyway. admit anyone Covid gets automatically counted covid death.

Also, almost almost noone dying now. county roughly 700 new cases past month. Would like guess many deaths past month? ZERO. Yeah, great eventually comes market couple years. lot healthcare system testing infrastructure. People US tend flexibility want well, many wear masks, many don’t. Many think hoax cold. US also weird lane politically complicated response that’s entirely different topic.

I think Europe areas done better administration countries taken serious degree public compliance varied US. Consistent remediation coupled consistent behaviors alongside public healthcare infrastructure yields optimal results pandemic. first half, gonna lie  headlines? ridiculously dumb said loud.

Oh turns age group aliens manatees? Thought knew one already..... gross misunderstanding earlier recommendations. Wow, shit, thanks informative article find evidence urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth three weeks following protest  better fascist country people like youngest employee losing husband cancer able hospital months treatment eventual death

Yes opposed restrictions continuing well.  don't. wear gloves à doctor said : better clean hands dirty gloves. I'm car alone, wear mask, useless gonna say, almost everyone St Albans area wearing masks see, adamant taking seriously. Burlington months, can't speak there, I'd imagine locals taking seriously well Oh good, I'm one. It’s almost like homogenous least populated states find easy get people work together. 

Same true dakotas. It’s almost like diversity may.... strength. fuck about? Vaccines, most, administered year. Treatments shoved throat monthly. universe vaccines profitable treatments? I'm really interacting anyone there. want banned forced quarantine. guys handle living amongst selfish people? friends hangout, go large gatherings, sports practice like nothing. straightup tell reason people dying, ignore it. cant process people lack care respect others times. seriously understand. come havent gotten yet? Literally summer theyve (i live southern cali) Pre-existing conditions. fat. diabetic. 
And yet morons think they’re immune ALSO fat &amp; diabetic. people, even affects personally, unfortunately. 

I coworkers think worldwide conspiracy get rid current usa president.

Let's say true millisecond. know many moving parts would stay sync make happen, say nothing lots nations able keep secrets - yet alone something would require worldwide coordination?  say...""I can't even...."" days ago, Meijer go Ohio new sign saying “face covering required entry” front door. Although wasn’t really enforced mac get latest American coronavirus cases right menu bar. need constantly check online latest numbers: Fast forward July Fir real.

Though pine laying law mf'ers nowadays. said anything single life?

Just look responses, literally bar people setting, mask order every year forever even coronavirus magically disappears, would still save least lives regular cold flu season even dispute true. completely uneducated conjecture, think spend much military, literally could afford provide services citizens without astronomical tax rates state needs catch then, never entered discussion. think mix epidemiological incompetence, blind trust authorities, Swedish exceptionalism.

Many people suspend critical thinking moment someone degree (and think they're incredibly rational it), amount misjudgments poor outcomes lower trust. ""These guys *experts*! Surely can't make mistakes *mere mortals* could pick on! think are?""

Add Swedish exceptionalism get around problem experts world. Swedish experts matter. differently, we're bit sensible like that.

A common narrative within country foreign experts *brutally politically steamrolled*, presumably would done like Sweden otherwise. Seriously. *Surprised pikachu face* Articles explaining individual scenarios still anecdotes. point still considered fringe case considering 12 million people infected reinfected. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's waaay many ignore though Best write articles support opinions get clicks. said, probably that. said really high stress cause it. I'm doctor anything, say heard doctor say things wrong here:

1.	You didn’t read article, you’d know that
2.	This didn’t happen America, happened Israel where
3.	This explicitly *against* law, per article didn’t bother reading writing comment, yet
4.	Almost 20 people didn’t bother read article decided upvote entirely wrong comment, said families discounted government's rules isolation contain coronavirus. Israeli law requires anyone close contact patient confirmed case COVID-19, anyone respiratory symptoms isolate home 14 days last day contact patient. violate law fined, according Israeli Ministry Health.

These people positive corona case *in homes*, yet still sent kids school. monsters deserve charged breaking isolation rules. think schools shot foot ""optional participation"" spring. I've heard students ready something do! 

As teacher, I'm also able tailor content individual students interests online. time energy spent getting 40 kids page directed individualization one one support. kids struggled year flourish much support lack stress feeling like always step behind compared peers. It’s easy. people sides fighting whether open not, downsides upsides both. Along influences political figures levels government. 
  Time tell schools chose do, I’m sure it’s going throughout country. saying months now. sound like broken record. possibly biggest collective threat US right now, outside delusional conspiracies. big ones, along investment growth population changes. Kids lean bit realize talking drugs system medicine one. ""So mean, like weed too?"" would require people thinking would actually happen them. Thank wonderful link subscribing :) True, cant take total pretend happening every day either accept us never pay amount emergency room visit. way works hospital bills outrageous amount expecting insurance company lowball negotiate payment. bill 15k, insurance offers $20.00, settle $250.00.  individual went hospital $20 copay nothing all. 

It gets crazy people insurance. hospital bills outrageous price insurance companies individual billing department set negotiate them. really seem consistent data, though. media focusing states reopened spikes cases, many states reopened spikes, strictly locked-down states, like CA, still seeing spikes.

It's also worth noting new cases stopped correlating deaths well month ago: Stop throwing massive parties weekends! Last night neighbors full mariachi band people showing throughout night. sympathy gone. hours working matters too. go much except get food limited trips gas station/grocery store, almost 100% compliance (the person saw wearing one gas station clerk people) around live (west Madison). think Milwaukee almost half state's deaths occurred, people would take seriously. ""look"" like stereotypical Agent Orange supporter basically everyone following mandate? Greed human trait built DNA help propagate species. American patent greed. issue rule law. Countries create laws maintain version civilization. Different countries different feelings that. create laws say person wealth $10million. don't. thread itself. one born country allows one rich humanly possible, like USA, someone will.

Social economics, economic system puts caring and/or material sharing first, needs completely different way create money much different accounting rules accounting circulation money. folks charge change capitalist economic system... period, since truly give fuck human suffering and/or lives. Lots outbreaks caused religious gatherings/services, staying away religion maybe also safer choice right Yeah, actual prediction 215k deaths election day. think 200k like 99% certain point. rich going anywhere. money politics, hope American democracy. one bit. don’t believe Harvard Law known that, though. 

DeSantis evil corrupt, stupid. free pass him. Trapped inside parents months time, never seeing friends, never going anywhere,

considering literally childhood, enjoy. Yet somehow prepared life like better majority population. turned severely introverted person trust people like society large. sympathy always lie children situations. I'm sure trying best, unfortunately talking someone grew listening message. Like said below, kids, say ""don't know raise children"" like young helping raise siblings. Changed first diaper teenager. understand frustration people must feeling, words still hurt length duration far true.

However, **novel** coronavirus far common biologically SARS MERS coronaviruses speak of. vaccination development able evolve quickly; progress candidates SARS MERS used sped process case.

And know cases, immunity lasts far longer three months. point, little reason alarmed. 100 million doses enough normalcy IMO least time people need vaccinated vulnerable front line workers would guess hover around number total wonder that's schools closed kids gathering large groups like adults lately. chance spread yet. people tell there's nothing wrong way news media write headlines.

Was teacher issued warning person/group? live VT, currently work supermarket, almost everyone see town store wearing mask. There's mask mandate, people always tell be. Dont get wrong, people I'll see adamant wearing one, there's large percentage people taking seriously America use FMLA. I'm rallying behind system place means, lot people understand systems place protect taking days off. never required doctor's note employees unless excessively, none business sick, sick. understand point view, surely take extreme precaution sure, take days sick leave contractor don’t get paid leave, Medicare don’t pay week bills gets piled top hospital bills yes got choice. Maybe change mentality companies hiring contractors give benefits full time employee! Indiana. Even though large signs it’s mandatory, management doesn’t give shit people adhering not.

Edit: spelling grammar corrections century I'd totally agree (although great lakes 3rd coast, provided keeps open access relations whatever entity contains New York). 

I liked Civ III loved Civ IV, especially Caveman2Cosmos mod (unfortunately computer handle past Antiquity). One gripes base game though, modeled 21st century problems poorly. 

A mod factors catastrophic climate change, depletes human productivity higher temps CO2, mass non renewable resource depletion, increasing floods droughts leading famine, mass refugee movements, societal breakdown, models actually happens nations/empires population goes things, basically collapse global civilization struggles regional civilizations hang on, collapse global population, ultimately loss human habitability across planet starts cool down... nightmare future humanity hanging thread. game IMO would awesome. time talent, would really like design mod, something runs least another 1000 years. think there's room interesting mad max tech tree also, something compelling ""future tech 1"", ""future tech 2"", etc.

Why essential workers fight greedy corporation government handing $600 checks people even working. Maybe money go essential workers unemployed unionize demand money previous employers. Sounds like great idea me, fun that. Duh immediate release - Hey everyone protest Main 4th street last Saturday, 15 individuals tested positive COVID-19 week. advise get tested immediately self- quarantine receive results. got email Dept Ed loans coming back. way read...big sigh. sure whether species learn. need develop social sciences lot find ways get people comply. can't wear mask medical reasons, terrified get covid. Pretty much. makes 0 sense surprising one position authority enforcing it, even though could theoretically fined complying. I'm Rancho yesterday neighbors throw birthday party waterslide jumper neighborhood kids attending. People care. let get straight then, since saying I’m misinterpreting you. university asked create hybrid curriculum intro classes train 40 professors deliver them. Instead best deliver quality education safely parameters school states health guidelines, would like quit job 20 years. I’m “sheep” “brave?” 

So onus falls change system? people elected? students won’t enroll go online? parents pushing us go face face won’t pay tuition? It’s responsibility? made lot assumptions telling ""fuck off""?? Lol. OK, buddy. keep assuming everything people know. terrible look Exactly - know three couples far proceeding divorce soon things open up, another friend drove today alone go walk SO, pretty sure might 4 couples... 

If fractures (and couples know) bet they’re amplified. It’s stressful couples, lacked healthy communication mutual respect this, absolutely see shits hitting fan It’ll probably downvoted buried yo bottom page knowing sub they’ll like damn live lives God-damned right did. daughter lost best friend 3rd grade. She’s barely pulling back together she’s entering 6th. teacher die fourth grade affected deeply even though didn’t really like him. agree wholeheartedly. know can't. similar access vaccine, too. countries don’t seem many selfish dumb citizens US, accomplish masks, distancing care yo

Also goes show shit leaders are. literally can’t think worse place spread bars. least indoor concerts sporting events, you’re mostly focused ahead there’s lot airflow.


The point bar go enclosed space people live conduct close-quarters socializing hours. Everything virus needs spread.

Letting bars part early reopening political economic reasons probably singlehandedly derailed first round reopenings. I'm divorce everyone dog. frustrated now, wait happens again. Empathy lacking greatly US. Yeah, advanced American hospitals even enough PPE healthcare employees. smh Gun violence claims 87 lives one day. Meh. can't helped.

Disease claims 87 lives one day. Meh. can't helped.

Terrorist plane crash claims 87 lives one day. OMG NEED GO WAR COUNTRY NOW! SOMEONE GIVES US COUNTRY, BAD GUY DO!

I honestly know disease kill count would high enough elicit even half response scenario 3. Except main component Oxford vaccine (Chimpanzee inactivated adenovirus) tested safety years now, namely vaccine ebola. Google chimpanzee adenovirus vector information Eventually...just give couple thousand deaths. 

🙄 study. Please note study done **surgical masks**. Cloth masks effective protecting one wearing (they're good protecting others). Trump way. No. Fucking. Way. great study. Petri dishes people drinking spreading virus around.

I can't see indoor bars able open, yet public transport wear mask social distance.

In UK they've open bars summer, yet believe close gets colder virus comes back. wonder much advertising directed people live St. Louis Kansas City. Come visit Lake Ozarks again! Hopefully happens Republican Party certainly adding anything system. like putting n95 straps cut neck gaiters type face shield.

Holds firmly place around good seal, much comfortable straps, exhalation valve, covers it. P.R. stupid stupid. No, mean even country ass shit, they'd proud it, *and* proud pride. Still Trumps fault Wisconsin 140,000 dead Americans. True lol. help it, maybe try die non painful way you’ve lived old age! one week ago moved ""the death rate low"" ""mask man bad"". they're ""Cuomo worse"".

I wonder next.  embers tiny flare ups - potus GOP said would extending unemployment benefits likely probably pay $400 week instead $600 get access charity money I’m
Brown? got tested. test negative. asked said gave date. say change it, assumed knew changed it... lol? ask question get mad answered lmao Uhh.. everyone die. right. Eventually. /s absolutely shocking news, water wet Hell yeah! fighter! Best luck Dad! appreciate it! wholeheartedly agree getting info there. trying best always. really tough right due virus actually people's bodies. 

And... course get hit n-95's unavailable reuse PPE, learning get pay raise year, increasing patient load, patients sicker we've seen, take duties normal like housekeeping, complete patient care, etc. Also knowing going find jobs much different us right now. Everyone healthcare saturated right stuff Covid. good work/life balance I'm keeping family safe (by visiting them) making sure days relaxation, although I'm feeling like drink much decompress. I’m point even seeing name triggers me. simple ‘Ugh’ it’s full internal screaming. school district offering different options based age. There’s option sending middle high schoolers back full-time, ones allowed back even part-time building ages kids 504s, IEPs, free/reduced lunch. California banned indoor protests, closed indoor businesses. pulled number ass huh? send last hope humanity back time, fend threat future. 

*Florida Man* Oh there's conspiracy origin perfect little bug real, believe accident, bugger escaped. Lets stay positive! makes feel better know many smart people working solution! Probably rationale “it can’t live take-out food containers”.. though virus like “nah, I’ll skip surface”. 

Here’s key deciphering clusterfuck: someone rich get richer telling it’s safe, will. Question EVERYTHING. Cuomo disgusting. He's praising handled Corona virus. He's blaming thousands deaths he's responsible Trump he's one made nursing homes take infected patients killed thousands senior citizens. Cuomo shut late let thousands New Yorkers travel states spread virus. There's thirty thousand deaths NY, state long shot, he's victory tour facing murder charges. Disgusting. think new dust settled people get immune, even temporarily immune, virus find hard believe vaccine work. finish Phase III trial get approved - need prove safety efficacy emergency approval. safety looks fine efficacy done matter weeks. think people's ignorance different titles within field, included - everyone who's doctor ""nurse"" variety. distinction noted, I'll sure use proper lingo on. rough right per pandemic Some.  know someone kicked husband thinking hoax putting family risk. see figure inbound. That's proper meta-study either, gimme sec rediscover read it.

Edit:  Considering sheer amount people read article, space time continuum split past changed actually happened America. Could teach us Italy got control, please? American, desperately need learn you. sadly none us want learn China. government paying people $20/hr work, Walmart would pay least $40/hr give Proteins bind spiky parts virus prevent infecting cells, similar antibodies work. Paris Hilton always seemed bit legit ""my daddy rich"" famous gals. Supernatural Repo! Genetic Opera actually like actress! can't remember music ""career"" sing Repo terrible. Assuming reinfection rates remain insignificant long timescales, least, sure. important homeless support is, bad time in-person photo ops at-risk population. could easily learn efforts video conference could make video telling us it. $55 per day district. $65 certified teacher.  Excellent. need hire 2-3 people nobody applying. used trouble. People may willing work since get paid to. no, source saying CDC march 2nd recommend it. see, asked question, ""WHEN"" cdc stated... ""WHEN"" means point time, provided source think know look things yourself. many sources would like provided? cdc since changed recommendation, know.

 

good luck condition Honestly, ppl dont change behavior pandemic, likely wont after. 848 day? That's 9/11 every 4 days .... found lot typical symptoms. 

There article came yesterday breaking FIVE separate COVID symptom clusters relative mortality risk. three mentioned clusters. symptom - loss smell taste. 

The day another group released rash present ~20% cases, 10% time rash symptom.

Not mention, kid fever cough. You’re likely get virus staying inside going outside stuff safely feel scratching nose looking study rate spread, deaths.

Kids surviving mean they're gonna infect parents members community.  depend type mask? heard surgical masks protective cloth masks KN95 masks effective. feel like he'd find scapegoat health department say influenced decision makes major ones. become clear he's spineless. ""I'll right eventually,"" president responded.

Holy fuck balls. Whatever. know trying make excuses guy. could saved thousands lives simply saying ""Wear facial covering."" That's it. it. Why? ""didn't think would get bad."" Yea. Ok.  started reopening there’s lot money doesn’t like sit. Plenty people though, die? Haul more! also places like Dixie Bea...we uh Huntington Beach. *the OC* general (I born I’m allowed say every while). huge, 50k upvotes.. Dining seems like stupidest thing trying push for.

There zero benefit society, tons risk.  would algae based thing help let alone HIV? Florida counting every negative test person, first positive test person. 

Sometimes people (correctly) counting tests. 

So depending one seeing, rate jumps down. He's trying Roosevelt play. skeptical. job people hundreds days sick time saved years. still come in. Flu? Rushed recovery surgery.

One guy group heart attack Saturday came next week right released hospital. said minor heart attack. 

There culture come work. We're profit I've never seen supervisor deny leave.  [This take went wrong Sweden. Folkhälsomyndigheten (Swedish CDC) likely assumed impractical long-term draconian measures would needed suppress virus, countries delaying inevitable.

In reality, seems virus suppressed mostly [contact isolation local measures long relatively infected. highly successful Norway, Denmark, Finland far. Norway opened bars amusement parks June 1 (amusement parks remain closed summer Sweden), 200 people gather since June 15 (compared 50 Sweden). [VG great stats page also includes timeline restrictions (under *tiltak*).

Kåre Mølbak, who's charge handling Denmark, [doesn't believe Denmark second Frode Forland Norway [doesn't believe Norway (larger) second wave stats Denmark, [Institutet för hälsa och stats Finland. good answer. candidates vote destroyed torn country apart. 3 kids 29 one 15. Maybe American dream; young mother incredibly hard. Anything kids young easy. quote always look articles there: “Nobody thinks worries hits home.” people still keep saying this?! made US, would happen shortage US due global demand. would say then? Damned damned dont shut country, no, spend millions anti-slip surfaces, building codes incline limit pedestrian pathways, codes stair step dimensions, codes guardrails. Nuff said, everything could reduce death injury falling. scoff use strategy another public health problem? Trump big baby hope enjoy kebab soon :) us empathy already know act accordingly. rest incapable this. matter ignorance. denial sky high guy, knows bounds. Yet another republican administration

Republicans cannot govern. make every situation worse. Spouse wears N95  honestly give shit ""believe"". scientific evidence showing work. really got? Nah, kids district perfect attendance meant everyday, doctors notes excuse absence earn award. totally pointless award, standard showing... ireland sick sign moral failure don’t want failure, you? /s Still here, governor done better would expected enforcement follow rules employers giving shit/ 40% population still calling “a hoax”... yeah it’s crap shoot I’m surprised aren’t place Ohio right now. alternative is... eradicate virus? happening. live perpetual cyclical state lockdown? want. I'm political scientist approve message. luck, help hide first month two.

You knew since January, anything till March we're approaching August yet half country still thinks conspiracy theory. really think two weeks lost due Hubei government would made difference? Melbourne, Australia, want second lockdown either, happened. think kid going school puking coughing like crazy actually learns anything day? Except maybe get humiliated everyone stares scoots little farther away them? correctly?!

They’ve what? 34,000 deaths?! sending old folks known positive back nursing homes! Didn’t clean subways, allowed lots protests purposely didn’t ask people tested positive protests, screamed needing vents told wouldn’t need didn’t need. 

Wtf... I’m starting take seriously. First don’t need masks do. tells us said didn’t need wouldn’t go buy all.

No one knows fuck they’re talking Red blood cells liver cells. Red blood cells lack mitochondria. liver lacks enzyme β-ketoacyl-CoA transferase. I've seen several comments Instagram people saying kids low infection rates transmit low transmission rates. want believe bad. I've place laptop gonna kindergartner? lots people live poor cell coverage. america huge country. tons places hotspot useless school. First force wear mask. come guns. /s  ...welp. Moar ppl gunna diez. uneducated? Ohio pretty wishy washy mask policies. Governor won’t make statewide even stores signs “requiring” I’ve yet see enforced.  Society learn.

Those position sign names documents change things may not.

Vote change want. Ha love movie Look Keisha Bottoms (the ATL mayor) Instagram. posted paperwork sent. He’s also trying “restrain” speaking 🤯 think it’s whether done political system. Even huge margins popular support policies, instance, 70%+ higher taxes wealthy, even “liberal” politicians don’t support act like it’s communist plot. Paid time off, minimum wage increases inflation, healthcare, infrastructure, public goods don’t chance. list neglected governance gets longer every year. isn’t don’t know needs done don’t want it, it’s even basic functions government hijacked. 

We don’t functioning democracy. I’m charging $78,322.93 looking post. Reading would require specialist consultant, that’s extra. showing hundreds people painfully dying everyday news, yes things would change. already struggling businesses expected pay two weeks paid time sick employees? sounds good paper think economically unviable many small businesses. 

Edit: downvotes, I'd favor policies funding them. dont see viable. going cause stores shut fewer jobs result.
Source: I'm economist. believe able stop spread virus.

Will help us lose battle slightly slowly? Sure wear masks stores next five years, people, believe makes difference end.

In 5, 10 years fully expect we're going fight people demanding mask orders every time flu season rolls around, like intrusion. Reminds L? M? Even evidence, downside wearing mask tiny upside huge. think might extinction mankind maybe. mean maps reality.  get send nurse, nurse says “you lay 15 min there’s nothing do,” come right back class.

Edit: School lucky nurse tech RN, RN really time manager paperwork medications. must hate guy since are. Typing phone drawbacks, however. true number much higher that. look deaths baseline deaths last 10 years. 

I haven’t seen recent data, around 100k confirmed deaths, actually 200k deaths average last 10 years. 

I would love see recent statistics this. understand? child free lunch breakfast family already food stamps programs. problem parents/guardians care enough time enough make food kids. offering food pickup doens't help cuz pick up. 

&amp;#x200B;

again offline learning. sure hand book kid nobody home make learn going to. 

&amp;#x200B;

and good Chromebook kid can't read? children k-12. hand chromebook kindergartner gonna learn anything. guess that's get put law enforcement charge mental health reason can't expect 13 14 year old deep understanding mortality, whether family's. Would one safe put oven though? must protect Bernie!  Ohio pick hell lot vegetables hour, difference $5-10 per hour translates pennies per vegetable.  United States Medical Bills.

It probably cost somewhere 0£ 0£ Come UK cities 1,800 people:  I'm hard brolonged periods, too. N95 HCPs right now? talking about, that's gonna do, walk morgue ask manager show every one's file? nonsense corpses line? think what, pose? Hey, look Luke Skywalker... ""But took precautions"", said. ""I understand"", said. Human beings 12 seem spread virus much though. 

It’s definitely worth figuring cutoff exactly. Dear God 2 million already! hear Iran 25 million cases!!! considered act terrorism. Amazes often someone makes ignorant comment end something like ""lmao wtf"" paints picture teenage kid clearly dumb people making comment laughing think much witty smart really are.

Here's goes, clearly even think two seconds:

1. case something immediately life threatening, simply call ahead let know. hard.

2. event something actually life threatening, someone else calls 911 effectively thing properly handling it.

See? hard, would require actually think blurting first dumb thing comes head. part problem. doctors similar professions understood, virus cause meningitis. 

All doctors similar professions understood, meningitis may cause permanent braindamage. 

But many people overlook something:

When one compares skeletons native americans died smallpox imported europeans, skeletons europeans died smallpox, clear natives much worse cases smallpox. 

If human population several layers **generational** exposure pathogen, DNA ability combat disease.

We can't reach degree normalised immunity pathogen within *one* generation. governors need charged crimes humanity waiting issue mask mandates. deaths hands. does? news? Riiight, almost like actually existed bad fellow. ""civilized"" mean ""~~western~~ non-russian"" yeah, sure...

ftfy too, comrade. US things bad businesses ones creating mask mandates many state governments won’t act. We’ve gone completely rails. Speak yourself! Sex main way people made afaik... sure IVF fap cup get baby batter. moment humans knew. fucked up. People offended word retarded might retarded. Nah popular sentiment lol Chinese everyday, week elementary school most. delayed

Oh really?

""...perhaps importantly children, opportunity cost brain forming access information help brain form optimally."" - Dr. Fauci school system closed last week last year horrible gastroenteritis outbreak last year, too. didnt film proving bad first though. reopened couple weeks shut Corona, too. dont want answer understand Midwest chance? Tell us bad thing. agree help stop spread virus? easy enough loan cheap laptops portable hotspots kids need them. Funding relief money would inexpensive way save lot lives. spent week Burlington ""highly educated"" word would use lol. Hardly anybody wearing masks, actually shocked much less people wearing masks New York State. lucky arent densely populated idiots close enough spread it. say businesses taking seriously, Vermont citizens all. Masks reduce spread masks alone probably enough eradicate completely. !RemindMe 1 year ""full trust people right thing""

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

Funniest thing Ive read today! Thanks that, needed laugh! they’re poor that, able afford thousands dollars hospital costs get virus? Blame game. Bold choice. /s I’m going first :/ stork may bring baby, swallow never will...  Since facts based Facebook newsfeed, could even time science reality? 27 year old dude waiting gig worker unemployment 3 months without single check. driving car dirt working doordash pay bills (and coming contact 150+ strangers restaurants every shift), blaming younger generations beyond frustrating. Yes, bars contributing spread ton, fact 40% Americans never $400 savings account one time work service jobs customers refuse wear masks. 

We're thrown wolves amidst worst pandemic 100 years, blamed virus continuing spread. absurd. Especially older wealthier generation getting along fine, refuses accept shutdown government assistance 401ks might take TEMPORARY hit. Florida Fair enough. guess peculiar situation granted pandemic, odd (or least feels odd, Scandinavian) unions seem anything say right police unions, that's entirely different reasons work groups. Shocked. dollar amount. driving work Westchester Queens April. complete lack traffic good disconcerting.   I'm going to!!!! When's best time get it? social distance living. Dont fucking come near basically state motto. Man think shouldn’t go jail giving somebody aids?

Why mad bro 😂 r/liminalspace fact is, check come instructions stipulations. money would far better stimulated economy targeted meaningful ways. reason individual people 

And honestly, I've given entirely supporting local economy. stores businesses employees even wearing masks (never mind customers). give damn health, sure caring financial future. right - one child transmits virus educator(s)/janitor dies result. don’t care you? /s  really hope find way make remote learning happen longer things control vaccine. Going back school insane gamble. normal times. trying everything normally would. could ravaging believes country rejecting (given abysmal poll numbers) failed rally. Hitler exactly early 1945, blaming impending loss war German people weak: ""If war lost,"" Hitler told Minister Armaments, Albert Speer, ""the nation also perish. fate inevitable. necessity take consideration basis people need continue even primitive existence. contrary, better destroy things ourselves, nation proved weaker one future belong solely stronger eastern nation. Besides, remain battle inferior ones, good ones killed."" saying ignore pandemic, it’s coincidence ICUs capacity it’s reported acknowledged virus spreading rampantly doctors nurse staff ICUs dying Covid patients? 

What’s point here? quote year, courtesy r/leopardsatemyface. really sucks. hope comes soon. numbers lie

No, don't.

Highest per capita death far large margin.  is. Trump gets pleasure harm others, especially gets away it. Hahhah! Thanks Keep great work! Fuck NFL. kids spread amongst unwittingly bring back home risk parents grandparents. might well gather whole community together get point. Trump roughly toddler intellectual scale achieved object permanence yet. Close eyes, stick fingers ears, Corona magically go away. Yup, day declared global pandemic, De Basio saying schools stay open, variety reasons, like someone could watch kids: worry. There’s going baseball US either. Forget 2020. Morons literally polite Cool, Japan one dense countries earth, less 1,000 deaths. lockdown, mandatory stay-at-home order, barely testing. do....not send sick patients nursing homes.

California led flu deaths last year, NY. NJ. Why? largest state population. Population density explain spread quickly, excuse NY/NJ leading deaths disproportionate think people don’t see standard conservative dumbass behavior.

Holding **all** government accountable conservative. rational mature adults address failures professional way. condemn Cuomo’s initial handling virus ultimately led NY become worse epicenter far, also praising subsequent reactions decisions. hope able see eventually, fall back personal attacks. great night. raging pandemic spurred school park openings make election difficult carry out. could plan along   mean literally live it, it’s bad, least compared vast majority rural America. feel it’s really poor say it’s stupid here. issues also there’s lot people trying good. There’s several liberal cities too. umm spoilsport arnt friday weekends underreported? Lmao state killed 20,000 people tossing covid patients nursing homes right...

Fauci lost credibility. Walmart hiring bunch bouncers too. violate rule 5? That's exactly reputable web site... Here's atricle happened Israel. One expert, Mohammad Khatib, talks middle watch he’s post office

I can’t. I’m distracted bean photo ops. I've never heard anything positive guy. thing remotely positive he's Mary Fallin. Hi, American here. send Italy file blood ship across Atlantic? Y’all call get results. still faster it... virus arrived first Western Europe, New York deaths France, despite third population work museum Nashville. Today, one close friends/coworkers working doors we’re using exclusively exits now. two sets doors nearby other. saw guy (just random guy mask) putting sticker handle one doors. walked around door, opened said, “Can help you?” ran away, got car left. sticker he’d placed door said antibacterial door american flag it. (I didn’t see myself, manager pulled off). I’m wondering anyone seen heard something similar, could think reason this. I’m assuming prank, time I’m sure would funny entertaining. Great summary public transport 50% since introduction mandatory masks I'M SHOCKED! Can't compare Holland (a region Netherlands) US general. 

A Hollander likely ride bike work generally spend time outdoors (natural social distancing) healthier higher vitamin levels. Team Fauci!! Someone tell test, lower mortality rate be. really close vaccine right? Well America good run. Short craziest fuckers there. going say akin Springfield tire fire much artistic exactly chilling think. revision date document 6/12, knowledge activated week that. 2020 shall forever known year Hindsight. goddamn shame Cuomo nursing home fuck up. could really *perfect* example. they're really, really good example. entire administration needs removed. It’s astonishing continue get ignorant they’ve already proven be. Fucking mind boggling  family lives California houses people. Rental properties, main houses, vacation homes. Doesn’t come like every 10 years so? last person Jesse Ventura?

My favorite difficult make explain think going obvious answer right face tunnel vision. Great testing problem solved, let’s p sister virus (I'm 20 18 okay mild symptoms suck we'll live) wondering safe hangout cat. parents house also hangout cat. Could spread cat parents? they’re smart they’ll follow Canada EU close borders rest us. Sorry kiddo. initial outbreaks concentrated spread places like nursing homes, “younger” fauci means like 60 years old. say 95% Asians, 65% black, 15% white. What's point? Yes, surely handling pandemic shows much cares citizens.  Clean up? wait another stimulus check coming? Agreed. sucks us actually follow guidelines suffer too. still. Humans cancer majority us deserve what's coming us. live lack data transparency overall understanding poor beginning, corrupt federal administration clouds even uncertainty. Absolutely. population lot it, governor truly shut immediately reopened slowly; hope trend continues. I've getting &amp; used wearing msk. Plus...it's *so* incredibly rude spit flying people. state giving list every single COVID positive person city every single EMS, dispatcher, fire department, going cause people get tested. understand patient, need know names + addresses everyone city COVID. would love if, fuckwit leaves office, every time photo pops online, merry pranksters edit turn face Shocked Pikachu  XD feel like whole international community shocked won, basically decided treat like kid adults table. 

Basically engage try use/distract wait next ""real"" US president elected rollback/renegotiate finger painting office.

My job shit. boss seems like everyone thinks fake and/or chemical warfare thats intentional weird shit.

About 12 us work there, one guys sister tested positive covid yesterday boss text us said masks mandatory work serious.

Not mention masks mandatory businesses whole time ohio... one wore mask time, bars restaurants go daily. 

I'm fucking anxious hell now. South Carolina: 'Can access data?'

Federal Government : 'What data?' reopening regard science already failed miserably want push fail forcing schools open. beyond me. Masks work, virus particles permeates mask. Masks also induce hypoxia injury, restricting air flow breathing carbon dioxide. Cortisol goes suppresses immune system. go called sympathetic memetic drive, causes fight flight. Wearing masks never established prevent disease. body stressed need oxygen. noticed recent days, leaders wearing mask, Fauci started month ago. ask why. Masks symbolic form globalist leaders say “ shut mouth obey” masks virtue signaler ignorant. ""The report shows death rate among elderly Sweden increased sharply spring compared period 2019. Sweden also significantly higher number elderly people died compared Norway, Finland Denmark.""


?  probably care kids right however, deaths seem rise quickly anymore. looks like almost stabilizing. Let's hope hospitals cope load, go much further. I’ve summed this, it’s politician’s mouth it’s wrong information, usually opinion it’s scientists mouth it’s financially driven back specific drug go politics. everyone Lucifer killed he'd made bet god. think lowering 0 work :)  state wide mask order, state R get. really sure wtf states thinking. got 3 times shingles 17. fun. That’s great, isn’t important metric “no new cases?” 

It’s nice Vermonters aren’t dying, infected? *Narrator: Human. Human never changes.* Pardon ignorance, use data way cheat election? Perhaps add votes people who've died COVID-19?  Sensory overload resulting desensitization. rough man sane countries. Mask mandate everywhere once, forced home office essential, contract tracing quarantine.

When right steps testing best way get control. Every time cluster flares contain region, two three weeks later dies down.

My country (Austria) already removed mask mandate (Except doctor visits pharmacies), feels like pre Corona times already getting lockdown. Lolwut?

Reddit wants see receipts information match want think. Anything negative Trump? receipts needed. Anything pro-US? Receipts required. page Data period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death.

The weekly number indeed one look at, that's used 7 day running average worldometer. Containment 100% possible implement widespread free testing, contact tracing, quarantine infected travelers, mandate mask wearing heavily fine refuse, early on, like let's say Feb/March. allow margin error. Sky news, shit.

They're really grasping straws fake lineup biggest scandal find. like Michael already mentioned, keep distance 1,5 - 2m. stores still Mask = Service Policy. I've seen handful stores Mask = Service policy. last six months taught us anything it’s this; we’ll probably back lockdown within fortnight.

Every single time Johnson said something won’t happen, it’s happened. record vegas Orlando made call, orlando lowering cases mayor vegas fighting reopen Since doctors know treat blood thinners carefully timed steroids.  Yeah imagine lot older teachers retire request leave absence schools open. current state Americans even panic knowing nuke flying towards them. Well older children young adults soooo... Floridians way Vermont. USA needs keep states closed visitors/tourists curve flat. Agree. wants win. likes title power. 

I dont think likes actual work. Fox Fake News folks, nothing see WHO'S WATCHING SKY WATCHERS WATCHING SKIES? It’s wild. don’t even know anymore. I’ve begging everyone around take seriously. brother wife tested positive. one “not gonna let affect life people” he’s like “don’t gloat man feel bad enough already”. want gloat? put entire family risk. mention restaurants area absolutely fuck even try follow guidelines. Indoor dining happening nobody held accountable. I’m loss words. truly am. County 2000 cases past two days. test ~3000 day. definitely know it’s going get worse county next LA, 4 hours southwest Vegas. least would kind decisive action.  Extremely exciting news. However wonder means take multiple times seeing cure covid-19 rather treatment. Also seeing we're hearing discussions immunity may last months. Looking forward results clinical studies. guys morons. Even kids fine (which won’t be), kids still going pass adults. means 40% individuals whose blood samples tested check antibodies virus containment zone city contracted disease recovered quietly. 

Well.....darn. Masks necessary people keep wash hands.  statements gave brain cancer. 

He believes masks... everyone saying wear one, wear one. 

And problem that? Um, science changes. learn new information might alter planning. 'good job' ""**now**"" Actually nonsense eclipses conjunctions tip off. easier contact trace chunks time alternating schedules. Better 1 week 1 week off, mon-tues weds-thurs different teachers. vacuum thing used years, absolutely nothing covid19 looking delayed news virus, gave misleading information. use to, I’ve got older realised number work places longer care. don’t take piss it’s worth risk I’m poorly longer feel guilt phoning sick, weather cover not. I’ve seen people take piss end something serious happen forces go sick last warning end losing job trust side said much masks safe standard mask simply holes it. 

she cant breath well. anything covers nose causes panic starts thrashing. main reason get go anywhere WFH thing get deliveries everything else need.


she supposed wear cpap mask night well cant freaks cant breathe. made cloth face coverings little looser around nostril area tight along bridge make feel less like something covering nose. 

the nurses seem problem cloth masks. 

i posed question argue valve made unsfafe rather new silicone masks start rolling may take minute places like CA allow them, especially places like hospitals everyone aware silicone masks actually filters one-way valves. 

i imagine videos people arguing professionals one-way valves rather actual n95 filters. wait fall-winter happen next chapter controllable surges tidal waves. fuckin USA-sized tsunami Dolts elect dolts. feel we’re living Idiocracy. Yeah it’s leaving 50% people fucked months according Spain.
LOL china done wear “I COVID” t-shirt. mask goggles. Nobody blinks eye. /s *insert famous Stalin quote deaths statistics here* cost much promoting black beans golfing, priorities. Yep... :/ Sad hear understandable. county. work hotel, y’all see insane there. distancing, barely masks. None people care. need “vacations” know.

I’ve never horrified work life. Maybe people read good news vaccine gonna release end year need worry especially purpose ignoring wear mask Yeeeeeeeeeah, inlaws rural. I've *seen* things. wow.. appreciate honesty

But again, im USA, would know. volunteers working polls retired people. who's going show replace them?  Fauci basically first god redditors lol. Saw poker vlog half hour ago Vegas busy casinos Strip seemed trading normal. knew post-pandemic video giant plastic screens fact - maybe 25% most, wearing masks.

Also true across river NH.  feed kid Chrissy Tiegen punishment. jk feel better. [excess deaths currently 5 years Yeah bet usual idiot. Holy shit thats like 4 dollars hour.

Now he's trying implement similar policy staters coming NY. (Insert idiotic comment photo Ron DeSantis hands gesticulating here) Isnt Vermont trees anyways?

Like gj lack Corona, think expected. one expecting record numbers Wyoming either

You ain't tx, cali, Florida, ny. I’d think wasn’t one thermometer even went got new one :/  listen me, listen experts quote. Unbelievable fear propaganda going on. different opinion get removed. Luckily banned yet, censoring opposing views need new account again. lot that. Currently, summer, means kids would home anyways. 55% parents working now? Highly unlikely. many people still clinging life unless vaccine, thinking long kids back school, things ""normal"" again. Putting kids back school reduce efficacy virus, I'm frustrated people saying things like ""kids get virus"" ""we data kids spread virus"", school age children basically removed equation almost immediately spring. experiment running fall. random alienation everyone happens named Karen, smells like Vodka me. like drugs - fault - mental health drugs make good companions. Hollywood advertises them.  sell take them, cause whole incarceration thing.  Also consumer society, poverty good mental health. Refer drugs. Many dumb - misled propaganda. ;-) I'll try again: 

No. there's lot selfish bad people think get silly stuff chosen god.

And catch it, god wanted (so nobody could anything anyway).

And die it, god wanted (so nobody could anything anyway).

There's also denials still think hoax would pointless make know since believe anyway.

And go on, covid-unintelligent-people country. long story short: no. wouldn't. (God swear bot stupid sometimes) lockdown worked great situation. bought tore foreclosure years ago. first started happening, grabbed bunch supplies. work month, ripped closet drywalled it. made good use time.  Really didnt affect much. start pandemic said black people die lower rate white people Africa reported lower death/million pop. black people America started dying even higher rate, people swallowed words. 

The reason likely skin colour. Indian population younger much less overweight. likely reason.

But underreporting deaths prevalent everywhere, Indian population size willing bet lot underreported deaths. lot early cases almost entirely staters bringing here.

No shit. first mask issue today. local grocery store, security guards basically seem responsible making people wear masks. guy wandering around without one, security told put on, guy said would come back later “take care” guard.

People actually wearing masks seemed concept social distancing, kept getting absurdly close me.

It’s important mention, juncture, take anti-anxiety meds. However, due national shortage, can’t get them, I’m completely out.

With nonsense store, plus mask face, started really feeling like couldn’t breathe, like smothered. know anxiety episode (won’t go far panic attack), mask certainly helping things. Managed get groceries get out. Practically ripped mask face got car. 

And know what? still absolutely wear mask next time go out. sure uncomfortable, would rather uncomfortable risk bringing harm someone else. often wonder raised people, respect fellow man. Mostly, good word it. stubborn almost 6k active cases get 300 500 new cases per day almost exactly number get discharged per day.

The good news daily death numbers single digits days. Armpit little lower oral, range armpit measurement looks suspicious. think either armpit thermometer broken calibration wrong somehow.  Latest research suggests catch once. Experts confident could not, including novel Laureate [Peter that's another advantage flattening curve: better understanding virus.

Here's July:

John Ioannidis: said emerging data support prediction lockdowns would wide-ranging social consequences mathematical models lockdowns based horribly also said comprehensive review medical literature suggests COVID-19 far widespread people already 50 studies presented results many people different countries locations developed antibodies virus,” Ioannidis, Greek-American physician, told Greek Reporter. “Of course none studies perfect, cumulatively provide useful composite evidence. crude estimate might suggest 150-300 million people already infected around world, far 10 million documented said medical data suggest fatality risk far lower earlier estimates led policymakers believe “is almost 0%” individuals 45 years old. median fatality rate roughly 0.25 percent, however, risk “escalates substantially” individuals 85 high 25 percent debilitated people nursing death rate given country depends lot age-structure, people infected, managed,” Ioannidis said. “For people younger 45, infection fatality rate almost 0%. 45 70, probably 0.05-0.3%. 70, escalates this, Ioannidis sees mass lockdowns entire populations mistake, though says may made sense experts believed fatality rate COVID-19 high 3-5 percent.

Sucharit Bhakdi (German): 


Sunetra Gupta: Levitt: France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, reaching levels saturation going very, close herd immunity — that’s good thing. think policy herd immunity right policy. think Britain exactly right track — fed wrong numbers made huge mistake. I'm sorry feel way. Preventive measures always better reactive, nobody allowed hide everything bar eyes public, creates feeling unease around, especially threat terrorism still high. 

It 100% security. French people may quite chauvinistic Catholic dominant society, one open countries I've seen religion-wise, largest Muslim community outside Muslim dominant countries, making-up 10% population. understand hinting banning niqab hijab racially motivated, I'm sorry feel way, think it'd allowed group Catholics walk around giant crosses backs Alger either...

Anywho, debate. Masks health nothing Niqab religion, end story. I’m genuinely asking see unanimous consensus threads this, don’t masks protect people, wearer? respirators provide considerable protection wearer, regular masks provide marginal protection, that’s everyone’s saying right? Honest question KILLER advertising marketing angle! gets tricky Public Health England numbers definitely overcount methods, also still probably undercount overall? 

The government organisation, ONS, tracking deaths, infinite-cutoff glitch, place figures around 50000, higher PHE’s 45000. PHE use death positive test, ONS use metric death certificates listing COVID cause death all, including confirmed positive doctor suspected strongly enough based symptoms add death certificates.

[The King’s considers ONS data likely ‘more complete’, make will. 

I think review PHE counting method absolute right thing do, data get confusing time goes otherwise, PHE figures likely still miss many deaths (particularly earlier pandemic tests really scarce UK). Death statistics much Area perhaps misread part, worry used distraction. GOP could win Presidency everyone voted. entirely dependent swinging handful states every election GOP use voter suppression tactics so. mostly aim urban centers mostly rural states try make hard possible people areas vote. deathly afraid mail-in voting, we've already seen elections done via mail-in covid, easier access voting always helps Democrat candidates. Republicans popular vote Presidency 2 times last 32 years, put perspective many Americans overall vote Democrat. another 2 Presidency terms via electoral college following voter suppression gameplan. go back 1800's find last cases candidates lost popular vote winning Presidency GWB Trump it.

They force poor people, particularly poor POC urban areas, choose going work able afford live, going vote potentially losing day's pay. enough voting centers handle voting population, opening hours make people can't realistically go vote work, making can't vote via mail, GOP tactics used supress vote. need skew thousand votes places per area give GOP candidates votes need win rural areas vote heavily GOP. math? random guy reddit 8 days ago, said data looked like Corona USA deliberate act ethnic cleansing? Yeah, seems like real reliable source. studied statistics years, skeptical claim random guy ""did math"" 5 minutes. quality information forum deteriorated substantially point embarrassing. remember sub young, smaller, really smart people figuring things out. would post qualifications explain data.. awful. really fair comparison. Masks still basically impossible come early days NY's pandemic, really testing besides critically ill, generally greater lack information, well misinformation. months later, masks abundant cheap, literally every medical facility tests anyone wants one, know risk factors virus spreads fastest. Yet states still refusing fully leverage lessons learned, wearing masks even though cheaper easier find ever, generally taking seriously all. Coflu-21!  Wait...Kmart still exists? stupid questions? Find next episode 2020, stay tuned... sad comment... Chy-nah: wasn’t meeee, aMEriCAH

i also noticed metro/RER lines mostly respected otherwise.. 

also live would say 50% people wear go stores. really depends town town (went Versailles far me, difference staggering, everyone wore mask there) interesting comment. heard called gazebo effect person said lockdowns make people crazy lockdowns lifted everyone goes deep end. Big difference we've learned better methods treatment, NY first big Hotspot pretty much testing ground effective ineffective treatments. FL able capitalize effective treatments get less deaths. 

Another big flaw NY dense population compared FL. 

NY : 27,000 people per SQ mile

FL : 353 people per SQ mile wary. Almost ""3M"" filters Amazon right listings restricted professionals counterfeits. occ health?  Shh tell anyone. people going come fuck up. Thanks, too. Las vegas looks like damn sun thing. Wait, that’s Vermont like? Shit thinking moving Vancouver, Vermont looking like good choice. don’t ever let employer make feel guilty anything, expendable them, it’s best remember act accordingly. Don’t go beyond unless there’s something YOU! Dam young people thinking invincible huh. anyone know survive covid, rate long term effects? Congrats, killed teacher. that's wanting eat stuff government took away COVID backstops. Masters education here. Research shown recordings actually good idea. allow students stop pause, rewatch content forgot didn’t understand, it’s equitable international students different time zones students need extra time general. It’s better professors turn cameras, increases students feeling connectedness. It’s also better use visuals addition text slides. Finally, big issue recordings need 5-9 minutes less, else there’s big drop engagement. 

Again, based research. entire thread bunch folks talking preferences, preferences aren’t always equitable, always pedagogically effective. Keep safe mate, hopefully mask requirements people wisening-up help us harsh winter/automn. Pay bars stay closed actually ""Paul"" wonderyears.  Ford buck-a-beer populist crook, ex drug dealer. part says getting murdered racists also problem too. I've got vacation planned October 1st see fiery forests. banning people Texas yet, right? blame em fucking shame world right still really want go. hospitals solely treating covid patients since March? elective procedures started back May/June?

Meaning 2 numbers

The total number beds available

The total number beds available covid

Once elective surgery allowed again, hospitals filled back goal 90% capacity beds. 


So see hospital 100% covid capacity. It’s important know hospital treating covid not. 


Many both. 


So 2 numbers Maybe lockdown wasnt strict,

It strict, barely lockdown. Italy confined people homes pretty much entirely. China welded people apartments. Vietnam quarantined 500 people every infection.

Here maskless yokels hanging Home Depots massive parties woods, shit would shut fast Europe Asia. quote *dumb stubborn* Covid19 victim Reminds family Freehold, New Jersey lost 5 loved ones think 11 12 year olds. kids teens. wearing P100 respirator, going catch covid can't spread it.

Most people contract family member. Considering live alone, wear around house too? Im getting tired PR trump. vote quit playing blame game... it’s almost like everywhere go it’s Trump’s fault. need redirect energy towards 1%... he’s puppet stake game agree more. fear future “I don’t really second guess anything.” 

Yeah, that's lead... death. sight, mind. difference:

*Prison rights Africa contagious.* make seem like compromise struck. Wear mask, stay distant. Yep, change needs done though oh agree, went hometown like 10km away live 100% people transports stores wore them.. town noone took seriously.
i also see people respecting rules insides RER/Train buses. don’t - every state country instituted lockdown exactly curves regardless amount infection. would pretty big coincidence say curves due lockdowns one two selectively due herd immunity kicking in.

That said even twenty percent act dampener if, without immunity, R effective 1.1 20 percent antibodies would bring effective R 1.

NY one stricter lockdowns best adoption masks. Subways still half full white collar workers still home.

When weather cools schools go back, chance test theory either way.

I think south avoided first wave nicer weather (70-80 degrees) spring. weather warmed North got benefits outside south went inside air conditioning. wave make brief run north heat wave probably sustained wave October schools go back temperatures cool.

It would amazing think 20 percent enough bad flu years, pretty broad vaccinations, almost hit 20 percent. know version article posted week comment...this beyond amazing - it’s like prez told America wear mask. Hope national chain stores like Kmart Sams McDonalds especially Taco Bell thing!! Interesting completely ignore evidence proves claims vaccine totally wrong, government literally opposite suggested might. 

Corbyn one presented documents media motivations obviously relevant considered. document states initial US position, UK going give them. yes, much easier refuse discuss it.  Detroit Blue Jays Excess deaths Mexico versus official counts makes disparity US UK look small comparison. Really awful what's happening there. Precisely  reason NYC plateau, whole goal this, millions infections NYC. current death rate .3%? Given better treatments death rate certainly higher. Let’s call 1% NY. 3 million people virus NYC get now. many people it, risky population already died. harder virus take hold NYC again. 


Look trends. It’s drop off. thing didn’t want. huge peak little. 

Take look celebration poster. mountain DEAD people. celebrating. tweens? way start, complain improvement. case Mumbai Delhi last month. wave travelled tier 2 cities states. Stay put - things get better. Andrew Cuomo Governor New York contracted coronavirus far


Chris Cuomo CNN anchor younger brother New York Governor. one contracted virus months back practically living mans ideological project  actively procreate. state better?

Are somewhere else? subway optional. Like Tokyo London, NYC cannot function without subway. simply cannot. None hospital workers would able work, example. heard confirmed reports, would still take precautions. unwrap food, go wash hands, eat. way packaging contaminated I'm handling I've washed hands. main reason people getting infected food virus needs latch ACE-2 receptors, cells nose/respiratory system.  Yeah, putting corona positive people nursing homes caused deaths tens thousands elderly people surely something model of. 

The problem we’re seeing today cases, deaths. good.  Global warming, like cranking heat 95 house? Cause bad think Trump mid life crisis

Also let’s folks watch COVID-19 Bourbon Bowl college football starts again.

I saw article Nevada, Arizona, Florida highest rates people wearing masks ignoring guidelines... Nevada almost bad Arizona, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, etc, numbers lower lower population.

Nevada less 3 million people 1,447 new cases Thursday, 1,380 yesterday, 1,182 today. Florida 20 million 10,000 new cases less per day.

Many similar symptoms coronavirus, too...sweating, becoming dehydrated, gastrointestinal distress... worse that, weaponized stupidity. get 'regular' flu, increase chances getting covid 19 weaken immune system? everyone fucking vaccinated. stupid assholes like were, flu would gone like 10 years ago. try clever actually Yeah right. definitely better best company lay us lose health insurance middle pandemic, anything sooner.

Took risk, behaved like good little capitalist servants, still lost all. phrase always reminds [this Falling Down. think America stop calling coronavirus instead call trumpvirus. especially US new infectious strain 

A definitely puts spotlight world see. Yikes, thanks! Fortunately, I’ve minimized contact outside world halfway decent state (for now). guess clarify- lottery $$$ lol! Florida 29k deaths, they’ll Catch NY! hospital work at? wanna check don’t mind. fiancé works hospital didn’t know mainly work 12 hour shifts? Seems little odd. Looks like still head ass that’s talking bullshit I'm starting believe human nature. parent try advise kids experiences kids know everything eventually learn hard way. view states now. least USA. pancakes guy. Seriously.  China different. infrastructure track people mass scale, laws designed around giving government massive amounts power, also even try hide it. Imagine hard would hide system tracks builds database 350 million people. hard enough openly let alone secret. remotely true, whistleblowers would brought light already. hell, even case China, limits. plenty things even chinese citizen make hard even near impossible effectively track you. brought Seattle bc place got hit early fared far better NY. CA New Orleans Calforna mean, saying even politicians take seriously, people will, I'm really following work. 
 
They're awful, without politicians would months-long closure even work? Actually.. political issues here

The regional government authority set hard lockdown. asked central government.


Since administrations get along, regional government set recommendation stay home, actual lockdown. alternative asking central government help... pride strong one.  wrong conclusion. demonstrated.

The Beder et al study non-comparative, therefore can't demonstrate anything, though may generate hypotheses. authors' conclusion states changes time might due ""operational stress"" rather mask. Also, data abstract, possible interpret study all.

The second study far robust. Roberge et al (the full manuscript free online), absolutely difference blood O2 CO2 levels unmasked controls, two N95 masked groups. Look Table 7 manuscript shows 1 hour timepoint. [Table 7 

The difference mention post Filtering Facepiece Respirator (FFR) space, i.e. space mask face. Yes, levels change, Table 7 (and everything else manuscript) demonstrates, zero impact actual blood gases. human body compensated quite successfully. isn’t putting bullshit that’s drive way way shop there.

We small bullshit Tops town, we'll drive extra 30 min hit Weggies myriad reasons... I'm thinking, two different similar strains. Lol nothing Canada realtime data great, eventually people go home, sleep, fuck, generally go insane. Weekend data already regarded skepticism across board. outright baked Monday's reporting numbers, least creates new constant batching Mondays rather Monday+what could get done half man power weekend. 

And really, data *useful* moment. Shit's fire, super matter whether fire 2000° 2048°. risk getting COVID much measure many people arent wearing masks around you... though wearing one certainly helps. shut T_D?  assume may call medications send oxygen. won’t admit though; think hospitals point though. triage plan, required administer comfort care everyone.

Obviously, save everyone can, aren’t enough beds staff everyone. Came find Chicago/Illinois comment. Im suburbs extremely proud Illinois Chicago. hope continue improve  things fear fear Ron deSantis State killed 10s thousands sending sick people Nursing homes

It's already addressed shit job Deblasio Cuomo did. Shutting late, encouraging people attend Chinese New Year fear looking racist leaving subway open prime examples shit job. Ah yes, another senile president. bad there's purple option vote for. Nice strawman. Every non-liberal saying thing. New York Michigan forced nursing homes take Covid-positive people. saying that's true? mandate internet weeks removed, saw myself.  Local strip club open upstate NY, yeah outdoor service idk that's legal okay. say ""the government""... government? think everything lie also think every government world agree manage coordinated effort pull pandemic conspiracy. still don’t understand hell many Americans think whole thing fake. Someone please enlightens me. Right ya, pal. Take day two news Word. I'll look it! #SO BRONZE ⭐️ ‘S REALLY MEAN SHIT. distancing usually can't afford to, won't. Karens could wanted give fuck. poverty forces work, probably figure fucked already anyway. wants shape people morgue? joke right? Jimmie Johnson's wife got tested due allergy symptoms came positive wouldnt say safe rule comment replied literally incivility lol I'm sorry. difficult lose people way. hope comes around someday. Nope borrowed time. hope suffer gets it. think government happy rate sickness death. weren’t would something. Regardless, you’ll seeing LOT headlines while. It’s vogue message atm. *8 minute 20 seconds Guessing numbers guy. Water wet lol observed

Right ""some people say"" evidence. 

thanks, seen actual solid evidence this. Anecdotal evidence isn’t well researched topic peer reviewed paper.

I wouldn’t take value, honestly. CDC knows situation desperate. recommended open classroom windows HVAC outdoor air dampers dilute virus air. [The White House subsequently banned CDC testifying reopening US coronavirus data go [directly White massaged.

The virus droplet nuclei contain float air hours. [Here latest recommendations using American Society Heating, Refrigeration Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Indoor Air Quality Procedure. That's makes easier get. Outdoor surfaces mostly safe due intense, frequent sunlight. go 15 9 hours daylight crank intensity virus going stick around surfaces outside lot longer. bar literally started making everyone buy ""Cuomo chips"" $1. Good bot cute, dammit. support NY then? mask mandate, indoors outdoors(when social distancing possible). They've intentionally kept indoor dining bars closed NYC watching Florida, Arizona, Texas, etc fuck states allowing it, well keeping places like gyms closed state wide. weird flex dump NY we're one states actually good numbers.  That’s important observation. Correct I’m wrong, seems like evidence role cell mediated immunity growing parent swear kid fever (brought thermometer) fever caused kids birth control. norther excuses worked sure slammed door classroom, scaring students. shit, Einstein! air leaking around sides respirator, wearing one fit you. 

Find one fit - problem solved.

An n95 mask (or even n100) certainly 'too thick breathe through.' Plenty people wear them, properly fitted leaking, day long. China bar trying clear that's sad. Weekend always light. Sorry, didnt mean “lol religious people stupid”, practically speaking since Vermont least religious state country means far fewer people sitting enclosed buildings hour+ time, gathering prayer groups even churches closed. It’s significant source transmission states it’s likely one several reasons Vermont well (and goes Maine). 

cc: /u/mike24jd /u/RestrictedAccount said: coronavirus common, also leads DNA extremely long exposure it.

But said, europeans brought diseases americas native americans **generational** exposure to, natives **much worse** cases diseases european would. 

Like survive infection coronavirus &amp; children &amp; children survive infection coronavirus &amp; children &amp; children survive infection coronavirus, grandchildren inherit DNA set nice blueprints deal pathogen. 

You theoreticize want compare skeletons natives died smallpox, europeans died smallpox, reality show native americans lacked generational exposure european diseases.

I guess expected grow gills flood coming evolution happens generations us wanting ""get back normal"". Honestly! constant digital communication person, staying super connected home. I'm 5' 2. I'd visit kids' elementary school various ceremonies/awards days, multiple kids *way* bigger taller (3rd graders up). Kangaroos go somewhere. absolutely right, wishful thinking end. think happening deaths reported ""today"" fact deaths occurred ~10 days ago. new cases mixture lag 24 hours - 10 days. tough correlate, think deaths 17th correlate cases 10th so. Definitely fuzzyness.

There's course also lag testing positive hospitalization death. there's 3 varying lags going making really hard assess correlations. Id wager personell scale F1 larger popular sport, except racing series. moving hundreds people minimum - least 30 people per team (with 10 teams), almost certainly least 20 camera operators (maybe far more, I've idea), probably minimum 50-100 logistical admin staff (probably far - includes scrutineers race directors, safety car drivers, tire fuel representatives, crew cameras broadcast equipment (F1 filming TV editing, networks get live feed announcers talk cut people), management whatever paper-pushers need site), probably another 20-50 people broadcast networks still allowed site (announcers analysts, etc). least hundred hundred track safety marshalls, probably local area. 

It BIG crew need move around, set take people throughout Europe, week two time. they're working arranging overseas races - Vietnam supposed first ever race year, would unfortunate lose maiden race. would great find way hold it, would give track local officials something much dry run much damp run, ability hold race without needing organize many people trackside handle tens thousands fans. 

Baseball hand, needs teams, coaches, broadcast staff (not many them, many cameras), umpires, ground maintenance crew, small handful security guards mostly ensure people sneak in. concessions staff definitely need there, usually significant part staffing. Yes, especially since I've seen Fox news interview. Exactly. might love idea leaving highschool kids home alone, impossible. something like that, could use empty high schools space younger students. literally LA/OC border might well border believe (OC = Completely Misinformed) beyond frustrating see people ignoring severity situation, less 30-40% people wear masks, LA refuses fully in-person school Fall OC forcing kids go school in-person.

Even state love California dealing tidal wave misinformed, emboldened ignorant citizens destroying progress made since lockdown, blatantly everything spread diseas holeding packed prayers beach, essentially masks allowed...

That beach 10ish miles at, pissed, fucks get fuck country cant handle piece cloth face RemindMe! 1 year lot contacts trump? Totally agree. think harm gave parents poor impression online learning, kids needed break. wanted distraction took advantage it. mention, time build courses would grading work kind thrown poorly organized way. word I've noticed people understand reality of

This. jackass dad thinks shortening vacation side country ""sacrifice."" Canadian here.
I feel bad millions Americans assholes deal dishonest self-serving govt. note well prior pandemic, employer definitely office culture employer. I'm longtime top performer there, knock wood, already wrangled way home office environment. exception. 95% 40,000 employees cubicle office building location.

The company quickly moved everyone essential employees, three quarters employees, work home first week March. plans longer reopen office space. I'm manager, circulated survey people managers late May asking overall team productivity. work space, particularly supplying large critical infrastructure elements, incredibly busy trying quickly expand critical infrastructure large customers also abruptly moved work home. words, increase demand provide, productive ever since office shutdown started early March.

They giving employees option specify whether want permanently work home whether would like office cubicle space. 20% non-essential employees specifying would like cubicle. company assembling information, going start consolidating office space letting go many expensive leases. anticipate office space going overwhelming exception, norm.

I say FTO something rarely gets used, we're managing workload working home small team group environment. culture company take pandemic seriously, overwhelming majority employees taking seriously. there's lot working lot time since one risking going office location, customer company's. 

Many folks used travel lot customer locations you, right now, kind travel requires VP level approval. determined travel absolutely essential conduct business continuity operations, denied. running large publicly traded business pretty much exclusively zoom Microsoft teams. Um, apply unemployment online, every state. Hey least one person Alabama following guidelines right here. trying come troll here:

...as we’ve good CT mass testing far? Agree. I've said media blame majority panic. people share go viral social media
 w/o even reading article (ever read comments something posted lol). people side pissed adds fuel fire, agree it, bs news spreading Corona false info.

I think big issue well people sitting home months months, watching news. entire lives, durring time frame, like straight brainwashing point.

Media what's turned ridiculous shit show. watch even interviews, can't even get facts straight make clear point, sides, like chickens running around heads cut gibberish spewing every direction. death rate jump moderate cases delaying care becoming severe cases.

This lesson Wuhan. treat Covid early easier. 

We made every mistake Wuhan did. 

- narrow testing criteria (china visitors only)
- limited tests 
- lack PPE dying nurses docs (new york) 
- contact tracing
- isolating mild. asymptomatic cases spread further
- big events (Trump rallies, protests)
- delayed care (mild cases waiting can't breathe delayed testing results tests) 

It's perfect storm.  Cause full? Lmaoo soo protester spread virus didnt spread home state. Look bars spread virus give answers. u think texas closed bars down? Even governor said bars spreading virus .All states open early suffering now. Virus spread rapidly doors. ask herman caine went indoor trump rally. know u want connected protest not. Like original point, states massive protest would spiking like arizona , florida texas. know 3 states common? open everything early ignored science Mainly, pandemic shown young people without jobs unemployment party non-stop die virus run money. dad died June. Diagnosed Thursday, sent home fever, died Monday morning. phone Monday morning stopped responding stayed phone EMT got house. suffering noises made haunt rest life. Yes, make matters worse, appears people darker skin lower levels Vitamin D; appears linked higher death rates.

 

 Damn man there’s whole comic devoted I’ve trying haha good fucking catch man that’s great right there. [Not sky rocketing? Everyone else going down. prefer society like China's ours? realize failed 79% 21% right? I’m sub, I’m going working fall. It’s worth risk pay. can’t imagine I’m minority substitutes either. Soo.. make middle high school distance learning, make elementary school optional spread using empty campuses extra middle/high school teachers, giving hazard pay proper PPE (n95, mask w/ face shields)? Yes! school teach huge interdisciplinary focus subject areas focusing topic time looking different elements it. example, science covering biology diabetes hypertension, health pe teachers covering macro/micro nutrients balanced eating, English look socioeconomic political elements food production availability. kids love unified focus. regular school 5-8 completely different classes much focus switching think really ineffective. surprised new year, one female crewmembers, ended knocked March, gave birth kid still stranded ship, poor kid becomes center citizenship crisis. data proven younger folks far less likely affected virus, there's plenty people wish fear monger, sounds awful lot like ""HOLY SHIT KILLING KIDS EN MASSE!"".

It's clickbait. Weaponized stir fear. Narrator: “It didn’t.” man, putting peaches can, concur. Lol funny cause made mask like this. n95 masks, tested materials (I work hospital labs), converted materials circular filters used silicon ring molds create seal. surprisingly effective aerosolized S.Aureus pulled air mask using vacuum pump. took swab inside grew alpha hemolytic strep probably came handling.

When took bitter spray thing practically penetration. double filters practically impenetrable makes tiny bit harder breathe. someone mass produce it'll game changer sure. think calling 911 counts calling ahead :)

I think everyone thinking circumstances, people show ER's driven family. That's allowed people carrying covid, moment step foot hospital exposing people, come entrance prepared covid...  [Why Second Wave 1918 Spanish Flu Reported cases Spanish flu dropped summer 1918, hope beginning August virus run course. retrospect, calm storm. 


* Somewhere Europe, mutated strain Spanish flu virus emerged power kill perfectly healthy young man woman within 24 hours showing first signs infection.


* shocking healthy young men women dying millions worldwide, also dying. **Struck blistering fevers, nasal hemorrhaging pneumonia, patients would drown fluid-filled lungs.**


* decades later scientists able explain phenomenon known “cytokine explosion.” human body attacked virus, immune system sends messenger proteins called cytokines promote helpful inflammation. strains of the flu, particularly H1N1 strain responsible Spanish flu outbreak, **can trigger dangerous immune overreaction healthy individuals. cases, body overloaded cytokines leading severe inflammation fatal buildup fluid lungs.** disease would burned people spent almost time outdoors wore masks 
Yeah got hit hard beginning long struggle get outbreak control, i'm happy we're managing reopening country go, mix bit: starts around 03:00. Clearly. hell cares attendance records outside local public school system? KOA v. point, court stated, “Requiring necessary protective equipment worn engage certain public activities simply equivalent mandating expressive conduct.” Face-covering requirements regulate conduct, speech.

Jacobson v. Massachusetts principle self-defense, paramount necessity, community right protect epidemic disease threatens safety members.” current hospital capacity like?

Seems like vital question whether good news bad news. Remembering hospitalizations Bergamo plateaued capacity. eat like pre covid19 times.

There plastic barriers separating tables anything like that.

And crowded well. Better look vaccines work conveniently omit parts go point, then.

Ftfy Here's great refresher hot day. course working lines loading trucks, think slaps sticker packages too? name GingerDomination11, hope disappointing click. feel 50/50 it

Nice butt hole btw. hoping BDSM. Butt lot sharpies. guessing O.C.D way colors arranged. \-Trump says charge. tyrannical government policy. Stop nonsense freedoms.

You cant drive drunk.
You cant leave kids hot car.
You cant doctor without proper license.
You cant sell prescriptions street.
....thousands examples....

These restrictions absolute freedom like wearing mask. one designed protect health safety people.

The freedom argument making fake intellectual argument pushed extreme right Fox News like. fake intellectualism. pure emotion wrapped academic language. fast universal healthcare, won’t happening anytime soon CO. already came 2016 voters shot hard:

*...voters also rejected ballot measure enact state-based single-payer system astounding margin 79 percent 21 Yup, useful research, useful controlling transmission. il est superflu Yup, people dont seem give shit numbers rising. would guesstimate half people see stores masked (usually older folks younger ones too). half sail around like care less, probably don't.  embarrassing. ... far doesn’t seem common.

The vast majority infections, world wide within last couple months. 

I would invite wear mask, stick around next stage. Plus use lockdown wisely. Secure PPE mask production etc. Educate people consistent messages safe behavior. Extend sick leave prevent people going work sick. Hire train contact tracers lab testers. Make sure supply raw materials chemicals available. providing PPE.  Yeah, pretty much textbook competent government do. Even summer camps closed. ones opened 5 9 kids one adult that’s summer camp pod summer. summer camp employee didn’t work summer, attest open camps aren’t taking many kids hiring adults. Socialization important development mental well being. However, keep mind youth stay bubble. biggest threat people connected concerning covid 19.

 thing know students react go school new circumstances. happens one favorite teachers die? necessarily gonna great children's mental health. 

What happens child's mental health brings covid 19 home parents one parents die? happens child finds spread Coronavirus grandparent dies? necessarily good either.

This say keep schools closed. truth matter going 2019 negative repercussions opening schools also hard students themselves. 

I'm sure student handling way many suffering asked best friend teenaged daughter felt pity her. said ""how sad going teenage years."" friend said daughter pretty great managing adjusting pretty well. Youth pretty resilient adjust happens unpredictable situations probably better us adults... IMO. 

 17 definitely concerned matters health. might represented average teenager many feel invincible think would wanted go back school situation. probably would given anxiety stress forced go back. 

Anyway, there's lot consider. data isolation misleading. Arizona moving patients states sending people home quite ill ""aren't sick enough"", current plateau would valid sign stabilization. IMHO- testing backlog selective hospital admissions responsible ""good news"". I've seen reports say antibody levels drop 3 months. long term immunity isnt conveyed antibodies, conveyed memory cells capable making antibodies case reintroduction pathogen.  They're best trucks. Huge great. big. Quite nice really. brother Rob crackhead. Rob mayor Toronto, died cancer years back. Singapore heat humidity. 30c 80%rh *should* nuke virus particles exterior surfaces. course, loads a/c too.... Trump social virus infects people wrecks social programming, like computer virus wrecks computer. 2 kids. said before. overly concerned personal health. followed virus beginning. concerned teachers employees. Talking long term effects virus without real evidence basically fear mongering extent saying children can’t spread it. It’s extremes sides. 

I also recognize fact kids go home give families. would arguably accessible vector virus spread encountered since introduction US. would gtfo right Missouri, ranked Midwest's #1 tourist destination working class midwesterners 1993-1998! r trying Leicester lockdown.

Wonder that's going... Yes, it’s constitution states open borders Americans free travel anywhere country please. tons masks silicone use HEPA filters switch out. several. save filters bought vacuum cleaner bags cut make filters. N95 better simple cloth mask. could done lockdown properly past months essential workers even risk right now. Germany healthy form capitalism industrialized world.

The U.S. suffering self inflicted “hypercapitalism” capitalism expense morality. come value property transactions higher human lives. become close minded purist religion, one deviation well, without using automod trigger words, guess pretty easily. ability travel, ability buy homes, see loved ones etc. don’t class suppression? 

Even tested negative got tested many times height lockdown i’m allowed see dad? say get shit. 

Obviously something want do, like said spooked bad journalism opposition - nearly every government around world has. people Oklahoma agree everything comes mouth.

Oklahoma disappointing place live. Also NY Can't wait till states war state they've cut Covid funding, state different views virus choose disregard others forced protect closing borders. RemindMe! July 31 Hoomans created equal funny bring Phish Burlington father law actually noticed Mike Gordon walking street (Church Street market). went said hi highlight week. personally seen Phish concert several times bored mind music atmosphere nice. 

For record, Mike Gordon wearing mask friendly all, FIL seem care. dead also results loss teaching license pension. sure bend take it. Hope use lube! hope god children. 35k deaths nation since May 25th due Covid? mean that's good clearly there's reason deaths used key data point anymore  wall Vermont split rail fence. Headline fine. value information. fundamental understanfing stats, going perceive massive increase cases, understanding actual significance. understand need hold exclaim broke new record cases mentioning relevant information many tests performed day positive rate changed. beyond anyone would ever think couldn't. “Teacher dies weak immune system” Except sumo wrestlers. it, I'm done eating sewage! see comment certain words banned including certain political talk believe. Maybe certain words too. He's probably using bargaining chip something wants. He's lowlife scumbag. Thank god I've running insane Karen cringe videos watch. Oh sure, I'd like inconvenient fellow coworker showing up, moment literally can't afford single day off. Even pandemic make decision go work fever 40 bucks make shift grocery money two weeks. problem new mask design exposed filters virus bacteria deposited make easier accidentally contaminate yourself.

That's first thing spotted mask well. looks bit fiddly, requiring fair amount touching potentially contaminated surfaces remove/replace filters. 3M P100 filters/cartridges half- full-mask respirators far easier remove minimal contact filter materials. explained point concisely first response. halfwit understand expanded subsequent post. someone explain without insulting another, mean should. 

Idiots called idiocy. Like want tell sending CVD positive patients nursing homes good idea, CVD disproportionately kills elderly, anything say 'scientifically' debunk

I never said anyone reading comprehension skills fifth grade level would able understand that. Saabs made anymore, everyone switch Subaru Jeep reliability issues. caught dead New England winter without wheel drive.  mean anything?

Do think closing bars working home makes difference COVID transmission rates? hate hope. stupid thing. ""A feeling desire certain thing happen"" Reality give fuck pathetic hope. want something happen make happen. realize crew members, guests, right? true. see reports 18 dying. Whats worse kids lifetime COVID related issues. majority people pay price things. crazy numbers seem charge usually towards insurance companies. might send bill cut quarter original amount single phone call paying yourself. terrible system needs extensive reworking, works fine enough people there's universal push change it. time infection death reporting. people died March/April infected least Feb/March probably realistically Jan/Feb. get testing started around first March capacity test sickest people. can't compare numbers say apples apples. believe doctors lowered death rate better treatment better job protecting vulnerable populations look numbers say virus drastically less deadly now. look states spiking deaths increasing too. That’s interesting tidbit. Muh Rightz!!! I'm pretty pissed find happening now.  Wtf waiting for? wonder we're still terrible. This. get tested unless want rights taken away without due process. real, people wanna say everyone responsible actions, say it’s Trumps fault. Yeah, lot fault, also everyone individual individually responsible actions. White House isn’t forcing go bars parties walk around without mask. people make choice ignorant every day. best thing test us head back work. know companies chartering private plans crew change employees seas quarantining hotel days weeks send out. first days harrowing take temps see anyone develops symptoms use face coverings best can. share place eat (even grab food try eat secluded) limited berthing need share rooms, tight working quarters. one useless attempts quantify emotional suffering ever seen.

Also really useful number unless see compared bereavement multiplier types deaths rising result reaction virus, like drug overdoses, alcoholism, suicides, cancer, stress induced cardio myopathy, starvation, loss health care, etc. crew members, guests. horrible side effects even 40 years ago haven’t found better drug hits receptor sites body keep using it. Personally I’ve discontinue use hydroxychloriquine multiple patients due side effects using treat autoimmune disorders.  things closed ships. None venues open. understand rationale. way clear people non-covid carriers. So, walk ER gunshot wound. gonna wait 7 days test results treating them? treated UK, fear socialism lead medical field bankrupting families. Treatment free.    Damn dude ready talk shit sarcasm flew right head... I’m TX unfortunately almost every single person know (even claiming social distance, wear masks, etc) regularly getting together family friends, less people time. Since bars closed people bored, people actually getting together others home often normally would. husband don’t trust getting together them, even outside. one actually distancing even claim are. see social media often they’re exposing others, getting together another group people next weekend on. It’s ridiculous. that's court system rich. poor $400 hour insane. That's probably make week. instead fighting plead out, get record prevents getting job, back months. America virtually cities, especially large ones, governed Democrats rural areas governed Republicans. Whether state Democratic Republican governor less function percentage state's population lives cities (i.e., urbanized state is, likely Democratic governor). states like New York California, majority population lives cities states solidly Democratic, Midwest (except Illinois), people live outside cities, states tend vote Republican. 

A slight complication people live suburbs, majority Americans live, might vote either party. really, America, whether vote Democrats Republicans simple population density: closer neighbors you, likely vote Democrat. crew members, guests. test hundreds thousands people day now. didn’t capability April. think regular eye glasses would work? usually wear Trump Flu One popular sayings 1914 war would ‘over Christmas’.  find incredibly frustrating POS want reopen country back normalcy every step that, refuse do! 
There's absolutely reason reject increase spending testing importantly contact tracing unless corrupt care US leads COVID cases deaths....I hate administration much. decency thrown window people What’s point even teachers union aren’t willing strike unsafe working conditions. Especially online teaching temporary viable solution. Might helpful include ""since March"" headline convey fear-porny outrage looking must live Burlington area hardly anyone wearing masks... already know lesson, minority never learn it, weirdly politicized national health crisis, ultimately get lot us killed virus care feel it. ""It's masks work""

""Check article""

""Nah, facts change views"" Yeah seriously, I’m gaslit fronts every fucking day. One minute think I’m right thing cautious, next feel stupid afraid look Snapchat everyone party, next read case counts know distancing right thing, next friend tells masks shouldn’t mandatory matter principle, next see Dr. Fauci recommending become mandatory, next feel like idiot keeping virus, next feel like genius see absolutely nobody else safe, next feel dumb realize I’m one it.

I hate problem US current storm snowflakes bitching ‘flu’. problem. People. Die. obviously proud *that.* else proud admit even themselves. Florida's population 21 million, 16% Floridians infected, means 3,840 COVID 19 related deaths reported CDC equates 0.1% mortality rate. beginning mortality rates quoted five 10%, scary numbers, sick people tested virus. testing widely available, see truth. take drastic measures flu. right hope disease would burn summer, despite contemporaneous reality Singapore getting massacred it.

People seem prefer comfortable lies truth. want move badly lol, even happened wait till schools open Let us clear here, years come people going need psychiatric help. 

I want point out, Karens, non mask wearing populous Anti-Vax crowd .. time reach ""herd immunity"" going 250k dead .. going 2.5 million 

Be ready .. *Cries Floridian* Edit: would downvote too. find horrendous public servants play loose facts.This made longer trust snopes. rate mixture. wrote Truth. said it. later said accept Trump says something wrong corrects later mixture well. Trump right’: President claims pandemic proved economic Goodbye would buy mask/filters emergency room instead CVS? gonna sack *all* teachers? There’s nothing someone far gone. got back spending week Vermont find Vermont praise hilarious! Burlington area mask usage like 10x less see New York State. Businesses seemed taking seriously, citizens Vermont not. Burlington probably mask usage saw around 40% maybe. Several smaller Vermont towns went probably around 5%. saw several large parties people wearing masks well. can't speak entire state, Lake Champlain/Burlington area indication Vermont got lucky anything. Oh another funny story.....we actually ran one members Phish (I recognize father law big fan) guess what....no mask. seem thrilled FIL came say hi either might gets time.

Oh Vermont drivers terrible well known thing? believe terrible drivers there. see movie Arachnophobia? like that, virus really. mask, treatment Covid infections get sick. putting Drs, nurses, others risk.

No meds you. (Soup Nazi) Embarrassing? *terrified*. realize response address point made voter fraud. first response first post thread nothing said either. wish thorough investigation. South Korea, bulge infected demographics 20s age group Shincheonji cult, secondary bulge 50s age group cult members spread parents. would therefore surprised index cases found 10-19 age group predominantly late teens already involved cult, likewise infected parents (household contacts).

If everything's distorted cult activities, data reflect transmission schools useful countries.  Yes, ignored president listened scientists &amp; doctors instead. pretty sure would way this, although might difficult right now.......but impossible. Moisture clogs mask find hard breathe change it. hours, always carry backup masks. put ziploc bags, one per bag.

If gonna rain, take umbrella. Unions? Can't everyone refuse en masse? Bruh ur disgusting creepy

Either liar troll take temp, say, three times row thermometer, varies 2 degrees, something wrong measurement.  least people stopped insisting comparing 2018 flu numbers? Doesn’t mean anything Kids go daycare sitters. Aka high school kids staying home.

If everyone stays home everyone still needs schoolwork. kids arent available babysit parents cant work educate kids. mask look small, illustrator drew model different angle. Lol end pay it? Whoever told wouldn’t charged fought waived. message tone people changed since 2016. guarantee they'll turn (unfortunately), people repeating correct message now.

What many also fail understand many states already put hurdles voting make difficult young. Fewer polling locations, work schedules make leaving vote challenge, stringent registration requirements earlier deadlines. Texas effectively locks full month election, may seem like plenty time, often period many casual voters first learn candidates issues. state big moving counties also quite common, easy way get locked voter registration.

The difference today news much danger we're register vote much widespread obvious now. sad took bad situation lead it, is. People registering much sooner aware dangers voter apathy.

Again, can't predict future. speak things I've seen locally, we're best here. A/C say AC uncommon. useful maybe 10-15 days year alot people use window / portable unit needed reason. 

Yesterday high 68, today high 86. far 1-2 days hit 90. Night temps usually drop 60-70. another month things start cool off. give Gov Kemp call, think knows whole mask thing either. Even worse: older people tend management positions forcing younger workers go back front lines work force. Notice said nothing working poor original comment? parents community's forums would rather subject teacher ill health can't bothered spend time kids. make arguments single parent jobs. Merely can't bothered spend time kids. without empathy. recognize schools often placed positions also distributing social services like free food essentially free childcare. would ask families try band together alternate days childcare possible. Netherlands called double bubble parents time kids (think: date night) allow kids playmates. US done fuck help anyone this. Teachers already give lot job. last thing give life. Agreed. Hopefully it’s tiny tiny fraction hopefully find happens few. He's troll. He's got pals cruising around threads backpatting nonsense shitting Fauci, Reddit liberal hive minds, justifying black van arrests Portland. data back up? much less effective inbound? thought mask supposed protecting people sick. least that’s latest regurgitated talking point heard said. another narrative shift protect missed? Fauci boomers destroying McDonald's masking. ""the young"" ya dick. top comment.  oh, changes things, must trust everything says. lot impatience. certain subset governors literally care said things essentially amounting ""old people want economy suffer lives"". feel bad workers. Tourism strong part economy work scary conditions... work lot conservatives.... they’ll scoff this. According media outlets watch NY handling poorly.

Edit: worded poorly. don’t think conservatives bad dumb. guys I’m talking hardcore Fox News/Brietbart/One America News viewers automatically equate everything California New York bad dumb, matter what. Young people work service jobs come contact large amounts people pay rent savings. F Fauci. dont blame upper class systematically letting working people die thousands want quarterly profits. work never actually specified date, mean think March started said 2 weeks thats everyone thought deal going be. it’s “when it’s safe”. I’m similar field you, basically work office vs home think company still offices us cultural standpoint. company never issue letting us WFH needed remote employees, think we’re basically home it’s over.    *actively* killing Georgia natives...  hope election result second term Trump. situation been/is set massive scene vote suppression coupled international interference.

Well one ER docs decided bill anyway 90 minute ER visit nothing done IV fluids cost $1600 Basically could anyone know COVID-19 early claimed...way (like September)WHO reported late December early January Why? purpose serve??? mention deaths, simply stated protests increased infection rates substantial amount.

Serious question/potential argument want get better facts possible solutions (and im saying wear masks):
So excessively sweat. Like summer drench shirt pretty short period time. wear mask, within minute usually (expecially hot more) mask soaked sweat. I've read bunch articles saying mask gets wet need put new one wet mask actually likely attract bacteria virus. pretty unreasonable replace mask like 30 times shopping trip head would seem mask wet attracting bacteria such, wearing mask likely get sick. get wearing mask people I'm walking around wet mask that's attracting bacteria, risk others well even mask? Also, sweat much, get severe headaches. Definitely enjoying every day.

For awhile used argument anxiety anything covering face increases anxiety exponentially also healthy, anxiety going quitting guess that's selfish thing. affects disease disproportionately felt among Latino Black communities. broadcast news, watches.

This also way covid19 started. simpler time 5g making birds spontaneously combust zapping cancer random people. know yet whether vanishingly rare? takes 3 months lose immunity point re-infection possible, we'd talking 200K cases. would started losing immunity last handful weeks. would 0.15% chance re-infection per week current conditions US. 

So would **be** small handful far, even loss immunity likely.

I'm saying loss immunity likely (and I'd bet forced choose), saying great deal confidence (because math) cannot certain yet, statistically. Thats good news. However, flu common cold mutations? would herd immunity affect mutation corona virus?

But I'm sure going blame 100,000 dead Americans protest ever took place black people. Invade Iran? good, satellite pictures help use chemical weapons efficiently.

Invade Kuwait? bad! War time!

Thanks! pretty nice normal times (politics aside). come make sure visit Sedona already!  reddit dnc asset! comments shills. Look, I'm fan conspiracy theories hate flat-earthers Anti-Vaxx people logical science behind 5g causing Covid-19 far off.

[Here leading scientist proof summarize:

Low-band 5G uses similar frequency range current 4G cellphones, 600 - 700 MHz giving download speeds little higher 4G: 30-250 megabits per second (Mbps).[3] Low-band cell towers similar range coverage area current 4G towers. Mid-band 5G uses microwaves 2.5-3.7 GHz, currently allowing speeds 100-900 Mbps, cell tower providing service several miles radius. level service widely deployed, available metropolitan areas 2020. countries implementing low-band, making minimum service level. High-band 5G uses frequencies 25 - 39 GHz, near bottom millimeter wave band, achieve download speeds 1 - 3 gigabits per second (Gbps), comparable cable internet. However millimeter waves (mmWave mmW) range 1 mile (1.6 km), requiring many small cells, trouble passing types building walls. Due higher costs, current plans deploy cells dense urban environments, areas crowds people congregate sports stadiums convention centers. speeds achieved actual tests 2020, speeds expected increase rollout. possible false negative, never really recovered initial infection? guys call ""long haulers"".

I wonder PCR tests sensitive enough determine kind thing? Everyone connected... easy Fair enough I'd still rather live norm wear mask much am. effective could lock state state Yeah filters it’s like could lip read something transparency advantage. he's not, think. Hopefully replaced book-smart, data-driven, backed_by_science governor respects math bow Trump altar. Can’t even imagine hospital employee right now. add long list unforgivable American sins. rhetorical.

This thing over. long shot. Ridiculous high US cases got it’s shame government quick reopen  Yes, good point. He’s hypocrite. went down, yay Looking forward election Covid “old news” Dude didn’t get Memo, pray aids away. friend. tough right now. Jam on! PCR test means lab test Jesus christ thats heart breaking Seems like comments shitting guy dumb catching it, guys realize bc got doesn’t feel bad symptoms it’s gonna strengthen belief Covid bad need masks overblown? I’d rather guys get get symptom free 10 million half 8 million?

Please play silly games. worse airport game count LAX forget NYC three international airports.

If count city itself, LA 4 million NYC 8.4M. want use entire metro area, NYC's equivalent metro area closer 18M.

NYC *by far* largest US city, densest US city, one international travelers entered closure, even close. 

And considering LA sprawl car culture's natural way social distancing NYC full-transit system everyone homeless movie stars use subways infectious. deadlier

You happy talk ""cases"" fit preferred conclusion. Curious. we're going argue ""deadlier"" means, simultaneously want convince NYC suffered death incompetence also less deadly virus time. 

You're arguing honestly. transparent worth time.  wouldn’t fail treat DVT, don’t worried part. suspicious DVT caused otherwise asymptotic COVID. treat DVT either way, probably also take precautions treating give test.

Blood clotting major symptom.

You family mask isolate home test comes back. good chance DVT caused COVID. Clotting otherwise rare age. Y’all never fail make laugh. accept premise fighting invisible enemy, must also accept high percentage certain major political party chosen openly side enemy. Yeah, would ideal, people need money survive... many people would lose healthcare lose job.

It’s simple striking not. read rest it, learn viral load goes time regardless clinical outcome. re-emergence possibility never contagious all. also possibility are. 

I read paper pretty thoroughly last night. really absolutely nothing particular situation. enough information right now. Taking research context help. Anti-Mask League 1918, too, came back. Smh. I’m 100% sure, I’d guess answer unless patient minor. 

I read somewhere someone’s family member taken ventilator wouldn’t make it, got go two people time 10min say goodbye. 100,000 dead Americans single protest ever took place. deflecting blame black people failure GOP leadership long protest disgusting.  never laughed hard Reddit comment section tonight. thank all. number cases spread out. March April cases heavily concentrated NYC made harder hospitals treat patients. exactly like see pile gunpowder, yeah dropping lit match make explode otherwise. obvious. whole concept completely redundant. know I'm thinking, I'm saying making good guesses compared actually something, good guesses based realistic outcomes. need anything already know happen.

Like get water, hydrate body. need first take little sip see giving someone else. I'm American progressive, since study seen thorough one large study. Playing devil's advocate, relevant 10-19 ages, represents 2.2% index patients? (Conservative) critics attacking saying study determine direction transmission (but thought addressed via ""equation"" confidence interval. RemindMe! 8 weeks ""Florida Texas death rate higher NY?"" think born certain race held someone, born certain family held someone. scary dont understand hypocrite...

The reality is, someone penalized born certain race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, even, god forbid, certain family.

edit: elaborate stance ridiculous, since isnt obvious you, consider long think someone able x activity born y? end children able something? grandchildren? anyone ever born family barred x activity? would completely utterly ridiculous, obviously.  Greatest live band time. Unfortunately summer tour got canceled (along everyone else) otherwise would recommend go show. One MANY downsides COVID death pretty much live music. Really wish competent leadership country Like couples shocked find they’re pregnant even though don’t wear condoms. “Do coronavirus Oklahoma? Absolutely,” Stitt said Wednesday. added: “I don’t think Americans, Oklahomans particularly, want bunker place next 24 months.”

Listen motherfucker, you’re right, one wants bunker place next 24 months

THAT’S WANT REQUIRED WEAR FUCKING MASK good fortune spared us, good leadership. scott vetoed paid family leave january, beating candidate ran updating internet infrastructure (which desperately need), totally botched marijuana legalization process. he's refused mask mandate, wants reopen schools fall... right get flooded tourists. think reason people give much credit want seen partisan, scott plays fucking games republican plays. occasionally naysays trump. whoop-dee-fucking-doo.

we're gonna hit 10k cases end year. train wreck slow motion. person gave COVID wore mask it’s much likely wouldn’t infected others. Soooo everyone wears mask ... happen?

I’m spoon feeding answer man. It’s really hard understand. backwards, danger rapid antigen test false *negative*. That's enough virus sample may detect antigen. PCR (as high of) risk like amplifying whatever RNA there.  combined fact republicans ones refusing wear masks socially distance actually leads perfect storm self destruction people blindly following leader causing deaths droves delivering entire country hands democrats.

Cause ya know, Dead people cant vote. FDR know one seems considering opening elementary schools keeping middle high schools online

Most us realize pretty fucked insist teachers go *still unsafe* classrooms. creating lot transmission vectors: staff, parents, kids (even lower chance spread virus). *Kids still spread virus*. Period.

This considered communities virus already much control. America.  2020 would suddenly make sense North Korea ends developing vaccine truly works zero side effects administrated life long immunity.

And keep themselves. thing doesn’t make sense don’t seem understand viruses work. Viruses need hosts continue survive. Either host kills virus virus kills host. everyone completely bunker (instead half ass shit we’re doing) would gone 3-4 weeks. Would people die? Yes. beginning would way less 140k deaths. 

Proof: see South Korea. shut everything down, delivered food citizens wouldn’t go out, easily accessible testing. they’re even wearing masks things back normal.  It’s confusing shit I’ve literally forgotten numbers US UK peaked, remember looking thinking oh arnt bad, I’m wondering US peak look like can’t see 110 million. mean, really easy tell REALITY TV STAR experience politics bad choice. thing Trump cares election. Covid-19 losing issue, he's going fudge numbers, focus law order.    
He's going tossing endless initiatives order take news coverage Covid. Portland example. Bolton covered strategy book.    
*""Trump said. “If read statement person, take Ivanka thing.” (The “Ivanka thing” flood stories Ivanka’s extensive use  personal e-mail  government business...)*    
Well, Trump going stuff take Covid-19 thing. Calm fuck down. typically go outside fear struck lightning? avoid travel car highway? Get grip get Reddit echo chamber.  I'm starting think might turning generation assholes. 11 days Florida 🤦🏼‍♀️ Honestly think would’ve better Joe Exotic election. marketing/branding acumen Hillary Clinton campaign manager *Because stopped testing, duh!!*

**-Idiot** Awesome. Love new innovations fighting Covid. 

One thing though, don’t like it’s clear. Seems kinda creepy. Make opaque I’ll buy one right away. SurprisedPikachu.jpg work banquets Vegas. mind right now. worked since mid March. work 2021 people pull heads collective asses transmission slows, I'm fine that. best people take pull speak others... level dumb...   drone lol It’s young people everyone leave reddit group.  think asked covid Lmao yes!!

 I'm sorry experience positive. can't expect every student , every district, entire country either experiences. Hence debate. believe safe slightest return person education. 

You also failing look beyond fact teachers spent months working hard improve curriculum issues. struggling learn ask help. Watch videos related topic. possible model topic home. 

You're shitting teaching methods understanding death serious disability could outcome great many go back traditionally. possibility probability. can't put forth better ideas furthering conversation.  Probably shoulda said beginning rather letting run completely wild first 3 months pandemic. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Yes. Unless want cake gay wedding.  ""Don't worry, want believe can!"" Trump claim credit best COVID response world vaccine ready. Never mind based Oxford's research.

(Though, fair US efforts, mRNA vaccine [was developed less week sequence published according interview Fauci. think that's groundwork Moderna vaccine proposal. course, Trump input this, Fauci's department job.)  Ok? Well I’m not. link saw 2 giving Trump higher chance winning, made mistake polls model predict presidential winners accurate 8 last 10 elections.

Another one said Bidden would end fracking gave Trump edge, people want lose livelihoods, however Trump handled Covid could literally end lives. suggest read article entire thread on. risk death teachers students way acceptable online learning available? many dead teacher would acceptable you?

1:04:00 - remove hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) ?

you asking cosmic question difficult answer

HCQ gone beyond science - become political, economic - become religion


we need focus science

the first thing HCQ pharmokinetics extremely unusual interesting

when take HCQ quite well absorbed gets taken red blood cells (RBCs) - high concentrations, rapidly

and gets released RBCs serum

the half-life exceedingly long - 50 days

it takes 6 months reach steady state blood levels

(what mean - mean constantly taking level rises input matches output via 50 day half-life ?)

rheumatoid arthritis/lupus patients tell takes 6 months see therapeutic effect ..


it takes 5 days maybe even 10 days get adequate HCQ levels lung

just taken RBCs, released serum, taken tissues

and kinetics really important understand

what means acutely ill now, going work


----

1:07:00 - think HCQ may role taken early symptomatic phase

within first 2-3 days symptoms - that's it

because pulmonary phase begins day 9-10


by time progress pulmonary adequate lung levels HCQ


so dont think HCQ role hospitalized patient

i think missed boat takes long (to reach adequate lung levels)


----

1:08:00 - think HCQ role early - may even role prophylaxis

in south africa used take HCQ week prevent malaria

because long half-life



----

1:08:20 - second thing think taken zinc

zinc HCQ go hand hand

HCQ zinc ionophore, think zinc makes much potent drug

thats problem many studies HCQ using zinc



----

1:09:00 - dose important - study used ridiculously toxic dose

if give toxic levels, going toxic

i think study designed kill people

so bottom line is, theoretically works

the problem science today really good


----

1:09:40 - look papers - Dr Raoult - science bad - papers good papers

the science bad difficult make strong recommendations based really poor studies

(should asked poorer countries lacking medicines, advisable would take HCQ prophylactically ?)


----

1:10:00 - Dr - add observation early phase

i treat patients aggressively HCQ soon feel patient going covid19 route

and today whatever patients managed never ended serious situations

so point making - place early on, zinc, hospitalized patients


----

1:10:30 - also think dose important - Dr Zelenko used 200mg x2 per day

i think good dose

once start using 800mg (per day) 1000mg/day start getting cardaic issues

i think use low dose HCQ (200mg x 2 per day) - zinc - safe


----

1:10:50 - Dr - same

and way Dr Zelenko us tomorrow


----

1:11:20 - recommend weekly testing healthcare workers ?

i think answer - endpoint ? goal ?

Firstly test (RT-PCR) accurate

Secondly patients negative test positive

so patients carriers long time

workers need diligent wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) - wearing masks



if develop symptoms - self-isolate get tested

i dont think cost effective test every health care worker interval



prophylactically could interesting - would recommend:

- vitamin d

- vitamin c

- zinc

and course question arises take HCQ prophylactically healthcare workers - really interesting question

and may role - think still prove it



Dr - India using success (?) - still waiting data india



----

1:13:00 - believe rushed intubate making patients worse ?

yes absolutely - think lessons learned Italy, Spain New York intubated quickly - treated patients like ARDS

this ARDS - think big mistake intubate early

you need delay intubation - intubation curative damage lung



----

1:14:00 - dont doctors know protocol - might hesitating use ?

there tremendous pushback
that simple
that good science behind it

i think got tremendous pushback steroids

we recommending steroids since beginning March 2020

mainly got pushback said dont use steroids

now RECOVERY study showing significant mortality reduction steroids

now cant question it

there definitive data corticosteroids reduce risk death


----

1:16:00 - Dr Bean - discussing doctor friend - made mess - stuck HCQ early steroids MATH+ protocol initially recommended - simple protocol - would saved lot lives

and (complicated landscape drugs) - antiviral immune suppressant

this become mess - could saved lives - save lives now


Dr Paul Marik - absolutely - think good science - got covid19, HCQ home waiting - going hesitate

so think got sensible

so agree - things prophylactically

when get symptoms got take HCQ zinc prevent deteriorating first

patients get worse - get MATH+ - think simple

make simple

take politics it

take economics it

i think moral duty humanity right thing


----

1:18:30 - Dr - think complicated - politics, economics, big pharma - big mess


i agree you

worst thing vulnerable people never protected - people long term care facilities - nursing homes

i think shocking whats happened them


they given

- vitamin d

- vitamin c

- prophylactic HCQ probably 

and protected them


----

1:19:30 - well MATH+ protocol evolving document - guided science - evidence progresses protocol evolve



----

1:20:20 - mask mask

i dont wear mask sleep

we need socially responsible - need wear masks interact people

if - masks - social distancing - preventing massive collection people - would situation Yeah don’t think much gets taught Alabama. true, do. confirm i'm saying. Tbf, they’ve vaccine years. They’ve worked effective COVID. way get attention money. long stock market going CEOs making money sitting lavish homes, NOBODY going care lives lost sacrifices healthcare workers. won’t take seriously unless starts affecting pockets &amp; political contributions right, I'm going consider random redditor's ""peer review"".  happen live downtown? small percentage them, all. even close. travel part scares feel like Disney done reasonable job. everything around fire, matter time catch fire regardless many protections place. Well fair, that's you. There's plenty cases - Korean study got lot attention would kill gathering 4-5 friends right US. Part 2/3:

----

42:00 - NAC quercetin - prophylactically

a lot make sense theoretically

so careful making suggestions

we take example - melatonin

we quite emphatic using melatonin prophylaxis treatment - surprisingly 2 weeks ago paper came out

that taking melatonin really low risk SARS-COV-2



perhaps referring Inhibits COVID-19-induced Cytokine Storm Reversing Aerobic Glycolysis Immune Cells: Mechanistic Inhibits COVID-19-induced Cytokine Storm Reversing Aerobic Glycolysis Immune Cells: Mechanistic Analysis




so example expect theoretically good clinical/biological data melatonin prevent getting SARS-COV-2

(does mean prevents worst ?)


Quercetin cheap safe zinc ionophore
so heck lose

it makes lot sense - safe

do lot evidence - dont

but little lose


what like give vitamin c zinc
because work together

quercetin zinc ionophore allows zinc get cell

(is quercetin better zinc ionophore HCQ ?)


vitamin c - quercetin - zinc - go together package

very cheap safe


NAC - interesting question - data sepsis
looking NAC - hasnt really panned out

NAC strong antioxidant vitamin c - vitamin c potent antioxidant

extracellular, intracellular - vitamin c actually gets mitochondria dihydro-ascorbate (?) - anti-oxidant

it acts anti-oxidant directly increases production anti-oxidants

so potent anti-oxidant


NAC obviously works glutathione etc.

but seems less potent


NAC safe

but taking melatonin - potent anti-mitochondrial anti-oxidant - truly astonishing molecule

all organisms make melatonin

mitochondria makes melatonin

it gets point taking

- melatonin

- vitamin c

- quercetin

you taking good antioxidants

and gets point diminishing returns

so add add - gets point beneficial


----

46:20 - opinion happy hypoxia ?

interesting phenomenon
can hypoxic activating central respiratory centers
and hyperventilating (?)

and probably reasons this

ventilation perfusion matching

some data involvement brain stem
so directly indirectly brain stem responding adequately low O2 levels


this makes dangerous need monitor pulse oximeter



----

50:20 - melatonin

we dont know optimal dose

is individualized .. majority goes liver

can vary 100x 1000x

you want take slow release form - mirrors body's production - pineal gland circadian rhythm

over counter melatonin gives spike

you want slow release

one things cause increase REM sleep

so take high dose, patients complain vivid dreams hyper REM sleep

these vivid unpleasant dreams

so take high enough dose get vivid dreams cut dose

(could hallucinations fever etc. due higher melatonin production body ?)


for prophylaxis take 1-5 mg night

for therapy sick patients dose 6-12mg night

what optimal dose nobody really knows


you obviously take antioxidants ie vitamin c etc.

so powerful antioxidant

but resets circadian clocks well


in recent paper people taking melatonin - ie massive doses - protective effect covid19


people take melatonin slow release closer body would release it

(does body release constantly certain times ?)

and take night


53:30 - dr says taken higher usual dose accidentally dreams vivid trouble distinguishing dream dream



----

53:40 - aspirin - anticoagulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral
is recommendation ..

aspirin makes good theoretical sense, good biological sense

but dont strong data

so unless contraindication aspirin few, would recommend aspirin - cant see harm do


----

54:50 - methylpredisolone (?)

we know RECOVERY trial use dexamethasone

they used wrong steroid wrong dose

very important

we recommend patients give loading dose 80mg methylpredisolone

that occupy glucocorticoid (?) receptors

we recommend dose 40mg every 12 hours

every patient different - monitor - CRP

some patients respond dramatically reduce dose within 5-7 days

in others CRP sits - increase dose

have adjust steroids clinical response - patient's pulmonary status CRP


some patients stop 4-5 days get rebound inflammation worsening oxygenation

i think give 7 days - reevaluate - CRP still high need continue dose - dont want drop quickly

this different bacterial sespis - usually wean steroids 4 days - covid19 completely different animal

it tiger bite you


----

57:45 - protocol says avoid nebulization - reason ?

RECOVERY study helped us - prior got enormous pushback - people said cannot use corticosteroids treat disease - would medical malpractice

now think data clear medical malpractice use corticosteroids - data overwhelming

show data

we effective therapy save lives need challenge studies rager Houston Phoenix. wonder many people take out. nothing working well Florida. lock unless start seeing 500 deaths per day. finally enough pressure Governor finally something. hope least. link thread links around 70 studies showing masks work varying degrees

I posted end comment dozen links studies I’ve read myself.

Basically data mixed overwhelmingly points towards masks reducing ambient viral particles. magic 100% effective mask, seems people want, plenty effective masks materials. 

Some data I’ve posted indicate masks effective, not, show mask efficacy varies material, construction adherence proper use, makes sense scientifically. 

(Scientifically illiterate people get tripped see news headlines medical data speak absolutes think science looks like)

The severity infection virus apparently varies based 3 main factors: 

Age, Presence absence underlying health issues/vulnerabilities, Dosage, meaning volume viral particles infiltrate tissues immune system begins respond. 

A greater load infiltrating particles detection increases chances immune system kick overdrive kill host cytokine storm drown lung fluid build up. also increases chances significant tissue damage whatever tissue system virus infects first.

Reasonably healthy people exposed fewer particles overall stand better chance kicking virus without much damage dying. 

Given information, anti-mask people ask themselves:

Doesn’t stand reason then, even general public wearing masks range effectiveness stopping say, 15-25% virus particles 45% 75-90% particles, 

If everyone wearing masks, everyone reducing overall ambient viral load, everyone increasing other’s chance surviving get it? 

A Sources studies: Thank God this. COVID beaten. Good luck, COVID. can't infect anyone. Dumb virus. don’t believe mythical way thinking. accept that, even world infected, less 3% entire world population die based mortality rates currently available. governor keeps making comparisons, yet anything stop happening. like “I need someone watch employees’ kids year essential workers can’t come work lack childcare, qualify unemployment.” 

Nobody listening parents. They’re concerned corporations suffer either in-person-work-necessary employees won’t show legally, corporate type employees allowed work home watch kids. rational world you’d right, low expectations would come fruition. live Florida governor talking heads blaming New Yorkers (you know, Democrats) bringing here. reading something wrong?

By looks study, first I’ve seen sufficiently large sample size, almost people covid never even sick enough go hospital disabled life. 

A little cough fever mean highly likely suffer debilitating symptoms leave crippled die. 

This seems like worst news ever come virus. last months, tons hopeful reports covid patients fully recovering. reports premature? odds fully recovering actually much less likely virus disabeling life??? 
So true! I’m physical therapist treated post covid infections many people need recondition get breathing walking improved hospitalization. wear full PPE get tested retested it’s definitely high risk position  hasn’t done before, doesn’t mean can’t done all. ask someone 60s computer powerful entire Apollo mission could fit pocket, wouldn’t believe either. speech**

Sorry, smart think are. trying funny though, I'd give 4/10. punchline needs work. I’m reading articles now. read first one depth. 

It ends However, new spate infections, government re-evaluating current COVID-19 school shutdown announced Friday certainly setback society trying return normal, Hong Kong yet see coronavirus outbreaks within schools.

It sounds like closed schools preventative measure community outbreak outside school. enough argument warrant school closures. can't say non-infectious debris since sure. That's poor assumption since missing information here. 
Also hear one symptoms times states? Check link... fever spiked higher 101F 2nd time, tested positive again.  
We hearing reports colleagues primary care patients getting symptoms times testing positive around 3 month mark. Could outliers bad testing. Could immunity thing fucking sucks. Could ADE. Guess we'll find out, let's dismiss possibility. ZERO idea recovery looks like thing.  Plague states America LMFAOF shit sherlock could - great news well.

But Oxford much ahead trials production It'll massive vaccine works mean that’s fine, logic reasoning points clearly mistake. never ever support government officials lying public health issues. getting outside lot, I'd reccomend taking vitamin suppliments. [there link vitamin mental gonna short stocks hedge Wish could upvoted once. keep seeing much criticism heaped parents, exactly society built - children go school day, therefore workplaces get away family-unfriendly leave work policies. parent wants risk kid’s health anyone else’s. already risking health going work. parents can’t pay rent mortgage without 2 incomes. Many kids whose parents position already daycare congregant settings summer parents working. one bad guy (except covid). *Vaccine comes out, millions people get vaccinated* 

This subreddit: Man really hope so. Fingers crossed. course can. Two three nephews COVID came within week attending two different parties. 

Opening schools going total disaster.

Right now, roughly 1% population infected there’s 140,000 deaths. happens infection rate jumps 10, 20 30%? 
There could million people dead. that, still knock hand person. always masks though it’s two second interaction, doesn’t worry me. Lol, AZ here, strange looks shopping must universal. I'm totally fine others back - weird others think masked people may sick? Like eff would sick person shopping? 😳 agree need data, something back mind ever since heard ADE Sars-1 back February. scientists pointed potential problem early pandemic.

But say reports worthless. Dr Griffin, one recent weekly clinical updates Week Virology, also mentioned patient second infection. patient even donated plasma treat Covid first infection considerably worse second run.

Most people chance exposed twice yet since places large outbreaks shut brought infection rates control.

It's important issue aware of, would foolish let guard catching Covid understand risk. bad changed reddit gold. Back really meant something wake see 80 Gold post.

Anyways I'll disappointed 2000 awards. !remindme 1 month Fingers crossed Abdominal symptoms common associated severe course infection. top three, list.

That said mean tiny part honestly really. I’m drunk maybe bought savini autographed half Jason mask like $80, (it's reusable) hell yeah ima keep using it. bring freezer trucks hurricane season you’ll overwhelmed need grid capability. 

It’s another sensationalized headline. application mask wearing general public tricky discuss isn’t really much evidence available. 

Masks medical settings generally worn protect user, different grades available- depends kind medical procedures doing. Lots evidence that. 

As far aware studies regarding efficacy masks vs disposable tissues respiratory etiquette (which usually recommended similar type infections). There’s lot debate regarding airborne transmission it’s really changing definitions infection transmission. moment it’s still ‘coughs sneezes spread diseases’. 

The best advice regarding masks offer going wear one get one protects you. really best ways protect general settings practice good hand hygiene, personal cleanliness, open window ventilation avoid noisy crowds. That’s next quarters ceos problem. anecdotes, called ""cases"" medicine used time produce ""case reports"" influence treatment strategies, justify inspire research help better document different presentations illnesses. whole host medical journals publish them. Here's case report Italy discussing possible reactivation virus person tested negative got sick month later worrying, yes, mean sensible downplay significance we're seeing. immunity lasts months, right around would start see reinfections/reactivation (whichever is). likely ask debt forgiveness and/or file bankruptcy.

The death curve NY says otherwise.

We may need 10-20% reach herd immunity real mystery got me. president Xi could recognize massive flaws US capitalist system. Going back original reasoning though - Even true, happens infrequently really worth even considering making policies virus.

This, agree with. know dude lying, least feasible aren't. yeah, policy perspective, enough outlier really considered. Insane US cases entirety Europe U.S government police agencies weld people’s doors shut considering assists lockdowns? Thats going Wuhan way early on. Aiming perfection get way good solution.

Ok, inferior, badly fitted masks stop droplets, that's point. mitigations aim reduce R. R depends many factors, essentially boil likelihood transmitting sufficient virus person person.

Washing hands reduces R.

Social distancing reduces R.

Being outside reduces R.

Wearing mask, reduces R stopping portion viral load getting next person.

When combine factors, hopefully reduce R &lt;1. That’s still pretty good. stop cycle 2 simple steps:

Of almost 2,000 samples, 12 antibodies, said Reinhard Berner University Hospital Dresden, adding first results gave evidence school children play role spreading virus particularly quickly.

## Abstract

There current debate concerning use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), hypertension management, COVID-19 infection. Specifically, suggestion made ACE inhibitors ARBs could theoretically contribute infection via increasing ACE2 receptor expression hence increase viral load. ACE2 receptor responsible binding SAR-CoV2 viral spike causing COVID-19 infection. makes argument somewhat obtuse ACE inhibitors ARBs ACE2 receptor expression increased compounds activate increase expression SIRT1. Henceforth common dietary interventions, vitamins nutrients may directly indirectly influence cellular expression ACE2 receptor. many common compounds increase expression ACE2 receptor including Vitamin C, Metformin, Resveratrol, Vitamin B3 Vitamin D. important acknowledge down-regulation blocking cellular ACE2 receptor likely pro-inflammatory may contribute end organ pathology mortality COVID-19. conclusion perspective ACE2 receptor, COVID-19 prevention treatment distinctly different. letter reflects current debate suggests angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ARBs likely beneficial COVID-19 infection hypertensive normotensive patients.

**Keywords:** ACE2 receptor, COVID-19, SIRT1, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, Vitamin C, Metformin, Resveratrol, Coronavirus, SAR-CoV2 Teachers literally writing wills they're afraid uncertain what's going happen everyone goes back school. Serious respect teachers... They're already underpaid, under-appreciated , overworked, risk lives? specific source, I've reading lots articles reports it. think google something like ""2020 flu deaths"" ""2020 pneumonia deaths"" may bring articles it. wish possible area! pay tested without doctor note I've addressed before, again, simply contact tracing issue whereby children tested/traced much. 

There's extra problem sutides like one linked focus whether ""index"" case family: (can't) properly control fact time periods studies, young children far less likely things outside family without family members parents were. 

Yes, young children never go anywhere without parents unlikely proven family member brought home virus infect rest family. shows absolutely nothing whether young children pass virus around easily adults. spend money testing give away billionaires. Yes is. picture also clear behind big ass face shield.

""Wagoner put shield register protect virus."" mean... always possibility would behave like common cold.  Something catch multiple times.  half colds due coronaviruses.  one tackled vaccine colds irritant anything deadly disabling.  

Now cold kills patients disables others. Ehhhh, yeah never managed make SARS vaccine worked.

So thats big fat no. Sure is. cannot whatever reason, rest America afford type treatment go without? make sense? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* +1 understanding works leading science emotion since early days. Ha, worries, I’m right you, google responding ensure wasn’t confusing two myself. Lol, parroting Trump communist. Sad.  guessed 500K minimum 2 million max start people thought nuts. people gonna realize Americans actually malicious.  77,000 cases per day mid-July, looking good fall/winter. Kinda feel like ship sailed one.... Conservatives constantly putting spark Dems constantly trying extend fuse... 

Does anybody outside American people actually want universal healthcare? think so, majority electorate already see acceptable healthcare vote believe that.

Healthcare forever tied employment America. hail corporate overlords. 

(I hope I'm wrong... hope hope hope) Monday. signs noted local mandate started last week Well looked retweeting video contained guy saying ""white power"". Trump said it, someone supports him, happened video two minutes long. Seems like bit stretch consider someone racist racist asshole happened video containing stuff hey, that's me. don’t want teach school isn’t offer isn’t offering distance learning get new job. plenty unemployed people ready replace you. real number probably probably
Higher think realistically speaking we're going get 0 deaths, look like big European countries even trying. might able get Wales, NI Scotland larger English regions, big city regions always one two. Germany went war country. Look now.

If response ""they okay *if* consider xxxxxx"" great model platform.

Norway Germany significantly better models. There's reason capitalism used pretty much everywhere, that's better. Wow ok thank you! Water isnt wet. Things needs dry order get wet. Water perpetual state wetness therefore wet. Basically sums exactly felt. optimism beginning might bring people together make people focus what’s important etc. Now? I’m completely defeated strongly considering moving country. still unable explain. provided concrete real world examples China capitalist. respond empty slogans post links can't even explain. Sad. Stonk line go tho  Lol like care capitalist apologist wants argue. comments working masses getting fucked capitalism.

I’m quite sure follow links read. fair brave men. Texas dug whole, let fill in. Yes people need understand US conservatism rest world.

On side coin, world's standards US liberals would considered moderate. bit conservative.

I gotta imagine world hears calling US democrats ""far left socialists"" thinking how?! even healthcare?! counties mask mandate others not, like Jake Tapper said, 1 side pool allowed pee in. It’s ever evolving situation. can’t declare
Victory, one can. 

But right now, oh Europe done well USA trash isn’t substantiated actual numbers.

Then look place like California.

Almost 400k identified cases, 7700 deaths. Compare EU country that’s phenomenal ratio detecting cases relatively minimal deaths. 

For instance UK identified less 300k cases 45k deaths. 6x many dead CA 100k fewer cases... make sense all? course not. England’s outbreak way severe. true number cases well millions. completely obvious anyone grasp numbers. I'm advocating deaths, clearly herd immunity possible, costly reasonably implement. Also would assuming 100% infection rate, 30% people losing immunity remaining 70% sufficient herd immunity I’m lazy Conservative news: Convincing assholes they're patriotic assholes. revised statement. Everyone knows school better kids, expense lives hurting long time, unique corona. make masks. bought one thought others might like know them. profit financially sale all. don’t even know seller. 

I tell you’re angry. lot us angry. USA might agree federal government failed us. beauty country American flag doesn’t represent government. represents us, people. flag coopted bad government, rise take back control. 

I meant inspire fellow Americans express patriotism wearing masks.

Yes, lot nuance lost, good science. Everyone read study internalize data. 

I would council consider many folks get it, they're exasperated people power politicized forcefully sold misinformation topic. hard continue patient measured country consumed scorched earth political tactics.

This study feels like baby step absurd anyone would change policy ii. confirms default assumption proven otherwise. part virus generally pretty well understood. Even though fully quantified effect masks spread virus still know wearing masks lot stop spread respiratory infections general. Well it’s controlling spread deadly virus. It’s lazy teachers. 

My favorite part bit social distancing schools. clearly haven’t school lately. Smaller class sizes? Really? gonna get teachers from? Everyone stay 6 feet apart? How?! building new schools?  Some*

Woohoo! Let's get party started! :D mask mandate, lockdown. Idiots. Seems like every population center didn’t high death rate start thing getting hit hard now. Meanwhile places got destroyed initially seeing deaths level decrease. Maybe virus run roughshod population decline. 😂😂😂

Edit- words. 127 (saved click) One reasons Great Depression bad Hoover fuck help people financial turmoil. looks lot like what’s happening now. sounds unbelievable look stakes. Everyone wants this- big business, politicians, medical industry,- everyone except Kyle thinks bill gates trying mind control him. also could destroyed meteor. That’s point, holding hope safe bet. us “doomers” labeled living known factors.  can't say certain, since body would resistant it, would assume would spread lot less. Haha easier where. Online teaching waaaay work. miss interactions student miss able assess understanding person. trust gut here. something happen would get people ""in charge"" would thoughts prayers, like problem telling people stick them.

Your family, decision. Fair points, would rather could stay home weeks wait thing out. right, ok put folks caring younger kids risk too. wish financial backing families right. would cost lot, everyone complies could knock relatively fast. Everyone points economic cost shutting down, going cost much we're last country still dealing want make inconvenient choices. 

I throwing idea splitting age u feel like truly rational arguments shutting extensively right fallen deaf ears.  Numbers tell whole story. first North America close schools, limit gatherings start WFH. First close borders provinces. think great whole. Way better rest Canada anyways.

We got hit hard old folks home spreads healthcare workers.

Also Quebec Spring break different time everybody else: Right covid picked serious coverage awareness. whole, Quebec great job flattening curve.

Edit: noticed username. Classic Quebec hate. disagree mandating masks indoor areas? looking shit Quebec. originally close schools reason? wrong live NH. bought window units second floor brutal without a/c  5% still 5%. I'll take it. Hold onto conspiracy hat please. Highly doubt ABA would pay story Canadian divorces... metal part syringe produced easily enough, glass part harder.

Saaaaame. first day go dinner friends packed restaurant...can’t wait. even little stuff like strolling bookstore going Sephora. Truly wait.   “It is” 😦 something written clearly first second half article seems buried you, must read much. Lmaoooooo went entire post history find race, business, education like something said post??? Well that's plain scary. Again, race baiting, proven loser. Carry profile research. not. point good arguement UBI extra hazard pay. Id love see maintenance grocery store clerks paid hazard pay top base minimum.

That still line past things like saving dollar hyper-inflation getting pandemic control.

Major sacrifices going required get this. think people idea store depression kicks still near dealing pandemic. see lot people coming testing positive attended protests somewhere, maybe would help us stop spreading stupid concept protesting spreading COVID.  actually went Sedona last trip, went Soldiers Pass trail! Absolutely. Stunning. I'm Louisiana, I'm used beauty areas like St. Charles St., seeing Sedona? Entirely different sort beauty know existed AZ. Felt like top world, love it! agreed, politics aside (considering Louisiana too) stunning state, can't wait make Arizona home! I'll give shot. Thanks! Winning! Thanks Trump!  Trump’s ability always say exact opposite swing voters want hear COVID-19 simply amazing. nearly every developed nation able significantly lower rates? 

Not able stop spread pretty unique us failure leadership. sub needs modification no-edited-headlines rule headline clickbait. underestimated stupidity people.  alluding inevitable heat death universe? Sounds pretty nihilistic.  September? Why, that's whole month earlier October I've told would soonest vaccine would available! :D paper said “case fatality rate”. don’t get continue say things blatantly false, like even close factually true. It’s baffling. Oh nice nice nice!!! least fucking Queen even diseases follow logic? Easy spread among adults, spread among children? can't understand anyone would think this, unless maybe I'm ignorant one room know adultsonly-itis Disney CMs trained de-escalate contact security. TON security there. CM Disneyland dealt fair share combative guests. really double system. would play clueless cm going get manager assist concern. manager would go play point called security. managers job (which ended well) keep guest calm feel like listening concerns security showed up. seams like indication Kentucky Supreme Court recognizing possibility health care rules decided county county county judges would insane. would be. Nobody would know rules applied.

There indication yet Kentucky Supreme Court side Beshear. One hope people Kentucky does. every industry. That’s exactly thinking, too. Yeah understanding they’re already producing get ahead production. US gave $1.2 billion start producing vaccines instead waiting. think targeting four-hundred million vaccines end year. enough vaccinate entire world, I’d bet resurgence might get additional funding produce more. There’s reasonable quick alternative sanitizer, Clorox wipes, TP, etc. 

If Fauci said “Masks important, however medical providers need every available mask time being. believe even fabric masks, made simple t-shirt help significantly reduce transmission” bet many many others would’ve made masks day. done study would make product less valuable? Say ain't so!

No idea science deniers think acceptable hole cut mask make breathing easier. people know joke? genuinely believe nonsense? real question long vaccine effective. 3 months? Megadeaths. purported unit measure atomic weapons.

Many colleagues friends tried get tested. April, situation describing sound like anything recent.

""Recent"" even relevant. What's relevant 150000 people got sick Germany nothing prevent long run not, no

Then South Korea it? New Zealand it? actually advocating whole population get sick? realize 10% hospitalized people end long-term damage that's basically disability? realize people disease people get it

that idiotic. offense, proposing insane scenario millions die. That's insanely develop proper vaccine people also use.

So let's millions die option exists despite countries it? death rate less half percent though? comes deeply valid question is, colleges/universities (and adult-learning programmes) running interactive online learning modules two decades now, public/high schools struggling even figure it? school boards trying reinvent wheel instead leveraging work already done post-secondary institutions?  #Trump: nothing see here, folks  VN good job. lot open Swedish schools also spending 50% sometimes day outside.

Nooooo! don’t want go back outside! wanna stay pillow fort forever! Idk man, November presidential elections, I'm voting party put pandemic plans place, ones removed plans ignored pandemic. 

- ""We best testing world"". Per capita, even top twenty. Never mind fact states taking week get results back, making test next useless.

- ""Our testing skewing numbers"". ridiculous positivity rate currently exhibited many states shows transmission pacing testing long shot. We're missing ridiculous amount cases compared rest world. 

- ""We're creating problem..."" true. sufficiently prepared, especially comes testing, things would largely control now. likely accounts made spread misinformation, report it, time stop tolerating Nope. done without mask orders.

Im one people affected teaching methods went end last year, maybe taken like student input all. cause we’re teenagers doesn’t mean aren’t aware what’s going world around us. idk gonna argue highschool student developed college student either don’t find colleges able valid argument I’ve seen lot people bring up.  There’s huge difference party proposals. One party proposing direct assistance workers, families, small businesses, state/local governments. advocates “trickle down” policies even principle directed first megacorps finance (the euphemistically titled “job creators”). That's staggering number. used go bar almost every weekend one since March. seemed obvious bars would place virus spreads. agree least awhile. childhood vaccines somewhere 85-95 percent effective rate usually enough prevent spread vaccination rates high enough lot people opting getting vaccinated might continue spread longer. Even vaccinated I'll wear mask infection rates drop negligible amount. (Note anyone may say flu shot effective rate often far lower lower guessing strains circulating upcoming flu season vs designed covid 19 specifically certainly hope higher effective rate) Don’t become part problem. think happen capable citizens move another country? vulnerable us that’s left behind countries don’t let older, less educated, disabled people immigrate without substantial wealth. We’ll unable much anything fight horrible conditions remain. 

Is responsibility save everyone else? No. simply abandon ship, knowing weakens us collectively, better people refusing wear masks? 

I guarantee positive impact stick around look ways help. America make it. yea worked smoking PSAs...  Well least ya know expect 😳  Uh oh, mean virus never disappear? Considering he's wrong literally everything covid-19 related far... think that’s really good news. people stores. feel bad people work tho. Time quit. Thought saw something news lot primary votes mail counted. That's primary buy oximeter eBay like $20 dont owe anything, seeing nothing said truthful.  Covid symptoms match hundreds diseases. boy tested negative symptoms. still understand put covid headline good know. Around people mask store go bbq friends family, someone’s house watch soccer, another’s house graduation party. interactions masks. (At least Facebook photos masks). sucks man. People want stay home. ""Because 'murica muh freedumb!""

The sad part is...no one knows long-term effects people assume nothing worry about. one states highest mask animosity, governor following presidents lead fudging numbers putting fingers ears. No, weasel, “overdone regulations” bringing Littleton economy ashes? Remdesivir effective given within first 24 hours infection - similar anti-virals, Tamiflu. 

The time makes sense give patient high risk category, tests positive, recent exposure.

If ran out, probably giving way many people. love sweden, cannot figure behind slow motion fuck-up corona response. swedish friends would even defend recently.


but sweden UK, US, brazil, india russia - countries populist/nationalist governments unable deal actual crisis, clever, well-educated people known planning ahead. happened? wait places reopen Schools. something cultural variations. ordinary social culture Sweden Finland seems encourage personal space Asian countries, especially comes multigenerational living tighter conditions.  went mall yesterday Canadian city Alberta-- people vocally resistant hesitant covid protections-- even despite unpopularity conditions, people wore mask. Everyone abided capacities stores lined taped lines 2m apart. Everyone used sanitizer walking stores everyone seemed conscious around them, maintaining personal space finding alternative route narrow spots. pretty positive experience.

But this, example: russians flu shots contains 3 (!) times less antigens recommends.
And ever given flu shot Russia, know even doctors clinics offer Influvac first all, local vaccine.
But I'm sure take proof, you? :) Lol  Kids get spread it. Look Daycare’s reopened virus spread via kids. Young kids protected group around world haven’t chance spread like adults yet. go back school Fall virus way US, see conclusively spread everybody else. might severe symptoms answer isn’t understood yet. WaPo article referenced CNBC indicated republicans split 25 billion funds used. get good sense precisely split are. sounds like least two republicans favor dropping allocation testing zero upcoming bill. article said republicans (again, vague) believed already approved 25 billion towards testing (which happen) funds exhausted yet. could valid point; however, know much left unspent versus much money US would need adequately cover testing contact tracing needs. suspect US needs funds thrown available currently... 

As far Trump administration wants spend money new FBI building instead, another WaPo article linked first WaPo article said, ""The GSA inspector general found Trump administration plan could cost hundreds millions dollars accommodate 2,300 fewer employees"". plan build new FBI building began 10 years prior Trump's presidency made case build outside downtown, Trump, evidently FBI leadership, want keep downtown. Plus, sketchy case conflict interest given statements Trump stake company related building new building downtown money original plan, less capacity people.   doubting get numbers from? worldometer 169 new cases for:2 days ago.

For me, getting flu coronavirus would pretty bad, I'm young, healthy male works daily, eats healthy, know probably ok It, spread someone else vulnerable, die. U.S system sucks young people.

In fact, one relative told experiences UK “fake news.” 

I think goes beyond mentality it’s “too extreme” etc.—it’s foreign. We’ve become isolationist model country can’t possibly work us (as perceive) entity need structure, even structure doesn’t work.

How many people US even passports? say I've smoking constantly since pandemic started gotten covid.

Coincidence? think not. still person see wearing mask outside (and go mail box Apt laundry room)

The FUCK, Texas Religion. know several exact problem choose vote Republican due stances abortion. understand young teacher high risk, primary care provider father high risk. see weekly. gets could easily die. 

Also, get sick (seems inevitable) going watch students? subs anymore high risk. mention 1/4 staff school age 50 come back. 

I know like .25% end ventilator, sure ill take chance family? risk? make 35k year, spend 900$ month student loans, im risking familys live still struggling financially. Normally work summer job possible anymore. 

Right school asking donations buy masks students dont one, buy sanitizer extra cleaning supplies, continue feeding kids year free like summer. Im completely opposed opening, believe educating students no1 priority NEED federal state funding work. people cut corners people die. least we’ll know oxford vaccine works school school weeks shutdown months that?

Fuck you, Fauci, fuck garbage subreddit. Well already Imask, created sicilian startup since 3 months... N99 FFP3 PS, UPS, USPS, Amazon, many major shipping companies still dont require masks worn correctly working factories, mask around chin, fine.

Every institution wrong job, poorly! Well, people aren’t getting it, easier meet demand. don’t predict Trump denying US vaccine altogether - seems little radical even him, weirdly say. I’d like think doesn’t matter fringe people don’t get enough traction cut spread... However, AFAIK vaccine isn’t likely super efficacious elderly, really need herd protection. would way it? also spend SOO much money military probably can't afford provide things citizens. educated people move useful things, like invent better toaster wage slaves sell Walmart. similar story anti-virals. effective peak viral replication phase - beginning infection. Tamiflu same.

When people ventilated, suffering virus, suffering immune response (hence steroids sometimes prescribed).

My source TWIV podcast - search Remdesivir updates.

This dilemma. administer recently exposed patients, even know whether end serious case. ...but administering post ventilation worthless they've already mostly cleared virus struggling inflammatory immune response - actually virus.

...so worthwhile course action administer highest risk newly exposed patients - few. ...and hence drug super useful. Doctors prescribing alternative better drug desperate say tried something patient died. bought chunk Filti decided I'll use removable filter layer. learning make things (for myself). think both. enrollment also days count three hours. strongly strongly encourage student miss school appointments make early late come three hours least counted.

There also story [a woman coughed baby mother ~~wearing mask~~ social see one almost everyday now. possible never really eradicated coronavirus bodies??

I’d like hear thoughts future look. suspect definitely new “normal” small embers covid flare-ups persist planet. Right everyone focused 2020 finding vaccine/prophylactics Covid but.. pharmaceutical interventions follow us next several years? imagine since handful people decline vaccine don’t access consistent medical care (especially vaccine requires boosters keep immunity consistent). hard disagree there. though somehow live Texas now, trusted Walmart employee can’t afford call sick don’t care. good ride 2016 shit bed. Yeah, declining percentage younger people living VT, people highschool/college move state reasons Nope, employer doesnt give shit fire zero repercussions refuses take basic safety precautions. Real men don’t get sick gay virus! usually kills old people. know, old people likely get something. ask stupid questions, god given right wear mask! forgot young people think one 60 dies. Cloth face masks fairly (far perfect) effective. Raw viruses get p99 masks well (they fall low-efficacy size band).

The point cloth masks trap globs mucus saliva viruses within them. purpose, even simple cloth masks fairly effective. effective real mask, much better nothing. Going online also allows wider range options choose terms classes interests. kids interests outside what’s offered grade level supplementing regular school work online courses since elementary. works motivation key. Unfortunately, lot people (kids adults) lack motivation. ahahahahaa love snuck hairpin turn! one favorite types humor. half time guess punchline right delivered, rug pulled joke special! know that, although possibility.  Many possibilities besides covid. Unfortunately going happening lot coming months Republicans ignoring science care people. Yeah, know, middle school high school students good social distancing 18-35 crowd. article says Israeli law requires 14 day quarantines family member close contact covid, explicitly following law. may Israeli law strong enough employee protections, may enforced school administration authorities. latter, big problem. can't rely social pressure everything. law meaningless enforced, either direct force (physically barring removing school) incentives consequences. smart pretend could explain terms 99% people could understand. one understands saying. Based logic real world datasets useless many variables. That’s mainly due companies’ terrible attendance and/or paid sick leave policies. someone please explain Europe little COVID19 deaths right now?

I live Europe many people wear masks, go clubbing, bars etc Europe fares far better US. Why? 

Italy, Spain, Uk France hit hard couple months ago since May trend going down. see quarantines fewer people streets.

I really know think it. used elementary teacher. would often go sick substitutes available, ones available awful would work undo things screwed room. mention time responsible making plans entire day. Well, definitely come toxic personality honestly.

I’m sorry nobody bothered raise well, don’t see that’s problem. Thank you, Mr. Data. Noted March/April. America decided care.

Whats really frustrating Americans appear worried refuse hold fellow citizens account. say banquets rare work thousands guests around world. I'm working, banquets. OK, tested negative covid. actually diagnosed with? family seek actual diagnosis test came back negative? symptoms could hundred things...some deadly covid, not. TREATMENT receiving? important questions. 35 thousand BENGHAZIS. Buttery mails! God hope lowest point. can't imagine lower point know sure fuck get worse.
I'm holding onto hope doesn't. 

Going meds crazy idea get sometimes feel like emotionless robot right better sickening mix despair rage.

We're definitely eachother's light right now. father died case still unsolved yet goes work every day busts ass spend time mom time left.
He's angel, make without ❤️ totally knew and, fact, invented it. Hey. people too. definitely different things based age. Every county around different plan older kids involves less school time.   censorship difficult handle truth direct result Vietnam War.

That conflict happened news media would embed reporters combat units show mostly true depiction horrors war, watching evening bloody evening, American people turned war.

America’s leaders saw unacceptable began demanding “standards” slowly surely pushed news organizations restrict content more. 

This dovetailed advent 24/7 news networks. name game keep viewers watching much possible, content needs frightening / outrageous, distressing enough make viewer turn away. Keep hooked, keep watching (most importantly ads make nice returns selling ad spots), don’t ever give reason turn away, catch fear outrage confrontation comfort cycle keep reliably seeking comfort payoff yank away next pre-commercial bumper binge watch day.

It became unprofitable inform public truthfully, it’s worth much money pump people never ending emotional Skinner box big pharma sell pills help people suddenly anxious. ""Google already bans ad network websites publishing medical misinformation harm others. new policy expands include broader COVID-19 conspiracies, ones spreading misinfo possible vaccines."" say takes away rights. usually people talk gun ownership due 2nd amendment. Either looking stir things school returns building don’t think it’s properly safe leaving high school job keeping two elementary kids home. safety ease # kids back building. everyone help literally choice return building.
I want say I’m lucky able husband sacrificed lot past 20 years lifestyle put kids first it’s really coming worth it.
I work suits us don’t doesn’t. 
This paying right now. ever wondered right thing know now! sadly, every area seen surge expressed sympathies ""Come see see"".  Healthcare workers seeing horrible disease going home, seeing people 1) state government conspiracy 2) refuse wear masks god country 3) state like cold flu sheep wearing masks 4) care get sick, I'm young state affected. arguments present March Covid ravaged across Northeast cried ""come see see""!! listened across Midwest South ""Come see see"".  disheartening listen cycle continues continues.

‘Those cannot remember past **condemned repeat it**.’ capable country learning mistakes made. say see ICU's overwhelmed death rates rising exactly areas experienced yet instead preparing, lies denials repeating cycle learn. heart breaks 140K dead loved ones shattered lives disease leaving wake.

Edit: typo wondered really needed put /S not

I figured I'd wait couple hours let up/downvotes show me. f\*cked there's many morons legit hard sarcastic enough obvious?? going put others position in. There's lack empathy Americans rich in.

I worked closely lot young employees (sometimes old ones) building financial literacy put kind position. I'm going explain specific cases, numbers I've seen. claiming one study true not, stating significance report middle high school students. bet old Calc professor field day. loved using medical examples teach. used disease spread demonstrate exponentials medicine dosage demonstrate curve peak decline. USA 200-250k deaths already, aren’t good counting. lot young people ground death certificates likely say MI, stroke, aneurysm. Ohio 13x many confirmed COVID deaths among people 45. sad thing studies efficacy masks. NIH, published, peer-reviewed studies. them.

I went rabbit hole CDC first lying masks obvious bullshit. wife started wearing masks early March. friend always struggling money wanted smoke pot constantly. used let come make dinner, give spare things didnt need, even let 3 loads laundry using laundry card place. drove around went way pick didnt car. one day wanted hang told busy blocked never heard again. Afterwards realized narcissist man crazy people act like they're friend times get tough still them. Yep Muslim,LGBT,Satanist...and NWO? Yeah I’m far south summer opposite affect northern states. Well I’m US, Trump GOP certainly make sure money get first. Agree, non-specific symptoms relatively uncommon COVID. could dozens illnesses E Coli poisoning appendicitis. must also admit ask people social also unhealthy

Why not? poster said, virus give fuck. taken seriously day 1, we'd much better place didn't. now, long months bullshit, still deal like beginning.

This 1960. technology. Use Zoom/Meet, play MMORPGs. online board game sessions. There's plenty safe ways social without endangering anyone.

Or think way ""socially healthy"" drink bar awkwardly sit rocking chair grandma talks good old days?

If take seriously, we're going state vaccine comes some. That's ""not healthy"" either.

Let following sink sec: We. Could. Have. Been. Almost. Done. believe Lowe’s near well another large store (not national chain) PA system. announce social distance due Covid-19, sanitize every often, please wear mask safety safety others, talk public county health alert. Feels bit apocalyptic times, appreciate effort. everyone wearing masks stores. stopped going Home Depot months ago masks worn anyone including employees. go Lowe’s instead. wish lol Nah. ain’t opening schools truth actually self evident? Even Jefferson held slaves declaring self evident truths. People die day infected, day tested. average, die it, die 3-5 weeks first symptoms tested. 

So assure you, see deaths shoot 3-5 weeks.

Also, there's thing ""over-testing"". Anything Trump calls ""over-testing"" countries (South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc"" call ""insufficient testing"" testing far higher proportion sick exposed people. 

Testing one tools (along masks distancing) limit spread save lives. ability test every American week get result back within day (the US process tests quickly, many nations do), we'd nail pandemic within month. 

So time see hear someone say words ""over-testing"", know either fool themselves, trying fool you. trying convince stop using least-disruptive best-targetted tool. understand correctly really difficult stay home US, even sick. doctor's note help you.
And supposed US, child sick? Skip work? Many places even give vacation short notice.

In Germany get doctor's note stay home. small child, gets sick, also stay home (up 10 days per year per parent). prevents people sending clearly ill children school.
I mean, parents supposed do? Lose jobs? Even 1-2 days without pay difficult parents tight budget. right here. putting scale context crises responded to, add flavor personal engagement resolution. 9/11 every American obsessed situation eager whatever needed contribute. there's hurricane thousand die, mobilize nation help recovery.

But are. 140,000 dead far, perhaps several times many end, can't even get people put mask. changes message 'use mask protect others' 'use mask protect yourself'. sister teacher first year teaching always cold kids. Colds spread way covid is- don’t really believe this. Teachers young kids always bent level. Hahahaha say keep putting pressure, give bullies. reject 10 times time keeping making go process I'm sure tedious annoying. also months and/or disease resurgence areas large numbers known cases systematically test positives. 

The ""prior"" ""people cannot reinfected within months."" SARS MERS patients demonstrate antibodies argue that. (a) diseases never hit people either driven extinct rare, (b) diseases cause known non-severe cases. extent MERS does, lose antibodies quickly.

Meanwhile human coronaviruses reinfect easily frequently. Hope helps see options action. there's hope situation changed, effort toward change wasted. never fit ocean bucket - try. injustices changed, hope possibility give us motivation change them. knew people would ask that, used different source.

This article talks middle I'm next county that, taking seriously, wearing masks half-assedly. Bastards....  Yeah right 150,000 excess deaths far year many taking fall damage ""this dangerous"" self evidently lie.

.2% death rate bud Press F doubt Good news, source reliable? truly hope so! 12,020 Holocene calendar. Can't see immunizations would (at best) happen winter would help August event, sorry. 
 
Are even confident school opening go ahead? walk ten paces turn wearing raccoon skin cap throwing machete opponents, guns. #noduh High levels cope detected “report” 979

That many new cases KY reporting. highest case # 625 May one long term care facility reported 300 cases. time, though, community spread. rate, become like FL AZ matter weeks.   Honestly, amount crazies around region alone whole state, phrase often use line ""florida man"" vaccum, rate doesn’t mean anything. better look day day see whats happening local populations  wins, yeah, fully expect claim credit. loses, it'll ""covid truther"" bullshit. got one Walgreens. Hearing much people’s oxygen levels crashing outwardly sign fucking scary. go sleep never wake up, never knowing oxygen dangerously low looked felt fine. virus sneaky enough, take whatever weapon away can. question come vaccine something mutates? 6 month effectiveness would good, even 3 months would good. We're national crisis every year distribute flu shot (though far fewer people get that); pharmacies administer enough people frequently enough. 

A longer vaccine would better, months protection - especially help reduce exponential spread - would great help. That’s good coombya type world economy driving factor worldwide. saying agree world works entire nation think VTs cases severe he'd act accordingly. VT done well things may appropriate.

All state restrictions alone leagues states. [Trump wonders injecting bleach kills coronavirus, Cristina Cuomo bathes doomed I'm fully ready fulfill promises lol. Nic Cage! get pharmacy like do, problem mean, stupid, let bleach. actually disease, coronavirus cure. Oh gosh  big deal body stops producing antibodies (this conserving resources) three months seeing disease already fought off? anyone data flu deaths? CDC site doesn’t seem right... totally see headline ""Oxford vaccine approved distribution general population"" ""we moment"" 200 awards such.

Though also agree statement. Wear. A. Fucking. Mask.. says like he's innocent bystander power. completely bowed republican pressure gave early advantage got firm action. Disgusting. coronavirus outbreak wearing plastic visors infected, Swiss government said plastic shields inadequate protection worn __in combination face mask.__ Hopefully we’ve learnt lessons

we people reddit intentionally trying catch covid think real, president telling that. year?! September year?! get Coronavirus hoax, ""Q'd"" conspiracy, overblown, ""just"" flu. fuck explain away dead overflowing hospital rooms?

Well would start looking article right here. mean .. first glance certainly *seems* ""morgue trucks needed many Covid bodies"".

But actually read past headline article find - Christensen, Texas Division Emergency Management spokesman, said trucks **aren’t immediately needed**, agency **wanted prepared case** COVID-19 deaths continue 14 way purely planning purposes**,” Christensen told American-Statesman Friday, adding state requested trucks July 11. “These trucks coming state, stage regions throughout state case they’re needed local government partners.”

So .. that's would respond. article *think* ""trucks needed bodies"" actually that.

So would ask point article ""overflowing hospitals"" bet able find kind inconsistencies headline actually said article. one 8x sub. Read rules people! experiencing something similar. husband thinks Covid hoax. like flu, everyone hyping, masks unconstitutional, numbers fake, etc. hand feel threat real &amp; must follow social distancing &amp; safety protocols. disagreements. keep quiet want another fight us passionately arguing opposite ends issue. argue anymore, since husband go work, &amp; behaves pandemic around, anxious &amp; edge lot. help live state high number cases, poor management government, &amp; inadequate facilities hospitals. sincerely hope someone find vaccine medicine Covid soon. wish us get alive. LOL, think schools ate going open (they stay open fall). Bright expert meeting rooms. [The syringe companies guarantee anything beyond fact they're working great Oxford people believe this, simply realistic. fact, went looking source 300m October. agreement US Oxford 300m ""will beging delivered"" October. delivered full mass inoculation.

I'd like live dream land magically comes together, clear people room issues. 

And Trump Admin say ""It's good, contracts!"" think vaccine hurt you. think worst ineffective covid. know harmful effects beyond that? Appreciate it, thanks linking that. Article said wasn’t recognized symptom gathering data something like that.  least different masks, people killing *are* vaccinated. study also shows Covid sized droplets tested different masks fabrics. homemade ones seem effective. According r/FloridaCoronavirus theme park workers testing positive.

 realize posting taking major risk losing job, need get chest health safety public. virus wreaked havoc far many lives thus far, information saves life even one guest, worthy disclosing.  work major theme park Orlando. Upon opening, hopeful new sanitary precautions taken integrity company keep us safe informed. However, come unfortunate realization optimism resulted devastating disappointment. forbidding employees news sources disclosing:  staff sick. mean really, really sick. could put number exactly many employees currently virus say department park immune pandemic. departments upwards fifty people positive COVID, others 12-20 per attraction. number give take recent COVID leaves taken coming week. HR forbids disclosure employee testing results anyone, seems advise departments tell remaining staff employee ""on vacation."" (A two week random/unplanned vacation, right opening. think situation obvious.) employee also forbidden disclose public whether tested positive upon experiencing symptoms. found ironic, guests visiting take ""vacation"" well? know literally paying possibly infected themselves? Furthermore, could unknowingly paying life?  get wrong, understand parks stated via websites disclaimer COVID exposure inherent risk upon visiting. Yet, time Governor state officials keep emphasizing faith theme parks safest place be. Upon reading this, felt draw line...because completely false. Neither park work for, sister park, testing employees temperature checks. checks often done cars AC blasting faces, temperature check forehead cannot confirm accuracy even much. Across board employees deemed ""safe"" based temperature check alone, yet still falling obviously ill end shift. beginning, tremendously sad.  vouch whether attend theme park point time. provide facts heavily hidden public eye. believe ""good"" decision person make one fully informed. choose based information ultimately hands. human guests visit, shoe foot would like know things deciding take family visit. Silence guest service, apologize visited thus far without knowing ""inherent risk"" truly entails.  safe. silence voluntary, enough enough. masks may cover previously shown faces, believe fear rages beneath one seen.

Here's link post:  Still ⅕ felt, always best eliminate risk take pinch salt, means checking sources quoted properly(a common problem academia) potential bias(particularly history politics). wiki said something issue know about, first thing would looking range sources say it. Maybe IQ test... risk going morons wear masks respect stay home orders. think would wrong response need improve healthcare, get rid it. administration absolutely removed though.  would awesome...winter northern states/Canada gonna suck usual without one stopped trying make SARS vaccine able essentially eliminate need contact trading quarantine. 

Once happened enthusiasm money dried research moved elsewhere. ""main component vaccine."" sounds like familiar vaccines work.

Like told commenter, vaccines plug play. vaccine vector already developed (that correct term looking for) mean plug new virus expect work. Additionally, mean vaccine automatically safer another vaccine different vector. arguing vector already development means vaccine safe despite breakneck fast-tracked research process indicative really understanding vaccines work. actually nothing subsequent approval vaccine widespread use.

Once again, I'm cautiously optimistic, y'all spreading real misinformation regarding vaccines, development, testing, approval.   Knew Bullshit soon saw Fox investigates good million dollars get virus? always make money get another life. far far far problems opening schools keeping closed. plenty ways work around still keeping high enough education keeping socializing option. there’s lot going behind scenes wanting keep schools closed ever know Um. think point wife antibodies show *had* rather *currently have* it, opposed comment longer term immunity. shit Luckily Oxford US. Still, licensed one company distribution. good news want elections possible, least red swing states. Part New York bad virus infected nursing homes though Florida definitely New York does. Florida allows happen deaths skyrocket.

Part ""DeSantis nothing wrong"" crowd like say bolstered preemptively protected Florida nursing homes. I'm sure persist widespread population. Sweden tried something similar work planned them. K-12 get school when?? Around December 10th schools winter break? I’m thinking schools it’d easier commit syllabuses schedules online instead trying like, bring everyone back last two weeks vaccine comes out.

I think it’d less tumultuous. Indeed. feel like virus spread conditions reopening - indoor, air conditioning, etc. ppl wearing masks, etc.

But masks arent 100% sitting desk, may take mask air blow you.

If look north, states 1-2k infections day. lot restaurants. Many offices still working home. Bad Bot.

This auto-mod subreddit place I've ever seen ""Hope best, prepare worst"" mocked given cutesy nicknames like ""d\*\*mer""

I assume last word got moderated, really needs examined recalibrated. get divorced then? joke that, given number idiots tried use bleach inappropriate manner...  long country position administer vaccine. things. everywhere. Especially US... Yep Exactly Chinese ""standard"" held Chinese standards...   I'm super pumped data tomorrow, extremely optimistic, breathe sigh relief passes Phase III. I'm fortunate AstraZeneca good foothold Canada, thaty government already ordered enough give every Canadian two doses.

It's going weird getting vaccine, knowing it'll over. TwO wEeKs article business insider talks little near middle article, wanted source talked availability would one greatest achievements human history marvel modern medicine. vaccine year mind boggling fast. honestly bit stupid point betting vaccine, leads defeatism people abandoning practices (mask wearing, etc) designed lessen spread, giving up.

The question many vaccines going have, ones going safest, ones going able mass produced quickly enough, ones going efficacious. There's secondary question booster shots necessary severe disease caused future strains (again, though, safe money humans either exposed virus vaccine(s) future disease look like common cold COVID symptoms we're seeing completely naive immune systems).

We're going essentially back normal time next year.

The question there's going political fallout waters successfully muddied massive propaganda campaigns everyone acts like 100,000s people die 2020 to. Don’t listen people telling vote, research verify sources make informed decision. can’t n95 masks mandatory teachers? they’re good enough front line doctors first responders, won’t good enough teachers? N95, sort eye protection (I use wrap around safety glasses) gloves/sanitation/or hand washing. Everyone ready inject themselves. Dumb people haven’t gone 100 miles city they’re born in, must right everything. 100 degree weather fried brains I’m guessing first wave 80+ people severe health issues. maybe ten year gapes age. 0-40 healthy range clearly last get it. 

The fact matter mass production starts world going go back complete normality matter what. hardly blame either.. started thought already pretty low opinion people, yet i've consistently shown fact, far generous opinion. like we're human right? mean? scientific institutions corporate interests actively hiding withholding viable vaccine worlds population nefarious means? 

This pandemic hamstrung worlds economy. country escaped massive losses financially. think companies, institutions, politicians, financial heads would purposely want occur absurd. mayer think we'd notice replacement protests month, 100% positive people crowding restaurants nightclubs outnumbered protesters 10 1. even counting house parties rich kids threw warehouse raves saw advertised. Get yourself. Bleach?

/s check out, thanks. fucking sad entire world laughing us. Yet New Zealand. example do. Yet fucking get, one check Uncle Sam. $1,200 going last 4 months. want data sent directly keep truth citizens, really want testing slowed? like Mr. President.Uniformed, unengaged self obsessed? want us put kids harms way sick evil reelection.Fuck administration. I’m Oklahoma. thought ok first. officially dead me. Okie funeral coming up! think it’s far civil war America rational people take arms remove crazies constantly endanger great nation. Beloved killed anyways parents. Updated publication date 7/16 Mine smells like shit. Colorado 
- First state legalize recreational weed 
- Decriminalized mushrooms
- Ended qualified immunity 
- economy jobs thriving
- smart pandemic 

What’s next universal healthcare stimulus residents? mention great skiing locations. They’re really making hard people want move Colorado. 10.7 L = 1070000 20% still lot, what’s point here?  nursing home issue baffling, New York's reopening metrics world class. state phase 4, besides indoor dining NYC, rise transmission rate, plus safe plan reopen schools. remarkable. nursing home mandate basically murder, rest excellent. know sounds macabre, we're middle major crisis. Canada virus somewhat control still takes extra precaution. US rushing Disney World set new records daily basis. deal need use laundry facility live. Also local grocery store, stopped going there. Even pharmacists masks chins last time get prescription. need get mailed prescriptions going...   like clear worry would look breathing week. what's alternative right? trap two party system. doesn’t actually exist

What doesn’t actually exist? They're gonna migrate drinking friends houses. going major problem teachers fall. likely required use sick leave asked self quarantine, still expected lesson plan post assignments time. Since teachers aren’t allowed hold many sick days, asked isolate 3 times year completely deplete sick days.  Redditor Barcelona here.

It's complete clusterfuck. article said, Ferrovial tasked contact tracing here, unlike rest country healthcare system deals it. means that, population 8 million, less 100 people dealing contact tracing, people call center operators absolutely background healthcare even training.

Since part healthcare system, dont access medical records kind confidential information, means everything recieve revised aproved first. leads delays 20 days call citizens contact positive case. Many times people already displaying symptoms highly contagious, completely invalidating contact tracing suposed do.

In case actually contact someone time, repeat prewritten message. cant wont solve doubts give additional info, tell visit doctor everything else.

Oh, marvelous system costing us 8m €. Eight millions workforce less 100 ppl absolutely nothing.

TLDR: people medical knowledge authority providing 0 help way late use. f ing morons place power straight Idiocracy. amount stupid United States politicians world. Adapted? Haha, people died faster pace short period time NY still holds biggest rate death people per 100,000 (178 put NY NYC together)... news makes sense.

THE DEATHS per 100,000 inhabitants... great example LOL!  Yah totally screwed...this resolved greatest richest country world slowly going back normal life NO...just saddened turned out... could get hundred million us DC, Congress might pay attention. Ultimately, ones holding power, aren’t they? Especially now. even us called/wrote first went. 

But still disagree well. trust data China tbh know, uses n95 January. Medical settings regular basis, construction mafia ran dry cleaning racket Cleveland 70's current day market prices reflect that. seen US military? know Trump would definitely pull troops Americans. even haves, ""We going make work"" group. sending kids back. means next school year paying pocket speech therapy x 2, 60 additional meals per week, occupational therapy 1, therapy coping skills de-escalation training typically provided schools. also attend paperless district, can't run paperless home, fully, paying supplies. sold one cars, reduced insurance others, crossing fingers 16 year old van holds another year, cancelled subscription services school related. depending second stimulus payroll tax cut get us rest way need go able finance second half year. it. to. Astro-turfing worst name ever.

Let’s call really is.

Cyber-espionage. Might sounded like joke it’s plain day now. New York extremely terribly, deaths state, also recent antibodies test hardest hit areas showing people go April peak 60%+ positivity rate, go virus anyway. Crime rate surging well, soon reopen economy stimulus runs out, cases certainly rise hasn’t gone much travel out. new reporting guidelines finished excellent podcast “rabbit hole” deep dive subject. Includes algorithm architect’s regret... illuminating. Exactly this. last time saw someone refer grocery store worker hero? give shit all? 3 months ago shining beacons strength amidst pandemic, we're back largely looking them. learn nothing improve. Honestly, fuck us, deserve get point. Florida, option Andrew Gillum; former mayor Tallahassee. busted drugs male escort. Take pick.  listened another large Denver suburban school district teleconference superintendent teachers staff Friday (Cherry Creek School District). impressed data driven mindset superintendent, explaining various metrics looks evaluating decision make. He’s hoping better guidance state, governor somewhat abdicated responsibility keeping schools open closed district. made point explaining there’s political weight decision: left versus right issue. It’s pure numbers science. would expect nothing less educated man running large school district, gratifying hear nonetheless.

Spoiler alert: local positivity rate doesn’t drop, sounds unlikely district start year person well. “solution” children teaching children. cousin attended junior college junior senior year high school (while earning credit both) teaching algebra next class following year. exceptionally bright, adept teaching. Saturday testing bottleneck. strongly disagree. personality would never self sabotage. Losing would make actual loser, one favorite generic insults hurl people. cannot lose. lose. lose, definitely fell favor centrists could stomach first time around, deep state, rigged election. 

Hell, called rigged election. 

If tired president, would step down, declaring succeeded making America great again, mission accomplished something something important Trump business related. check youtube  Question is, *who allowed supported that?* here, wasn’t bullied, wanted play computer pajamas. is...SPARTA!!! Uhh, no. SC also rural.  also go without shaving. People need stop saying “recovered”. Instead say “survived”. lose leg Covid didn’t recover. Also long lasting nerve/lung/heart damage, blood clots, strokes, exhaustion..... “recovered” ass New York State DEATHS per 100,000 inhabitants... great example LOL! Keep wearing masks. Keep social distancing. Keep border closed. woods yet. things right track looking up. Vermont is, like, Canadian province U.S. thing missing universal healthcare. I'm surprised Bernie brought yet.

Alberta opposite. U.S. state Canada. Jesus christ, mask arent protect yourselfs fucking idiots, dont spread virus around everybody.

is astonishing amount retarads believe mask protect yourselfs. pretty stupid Let guess, (D)? Smart! really hoping Wisconsin follows path, not, gotta figure homeschooling vaccinations zero deaths month. Didn’t fauci come say knew sub, call masks initially keep masks healthcare workers maybe mistake. Oh UGH! young people we’re depending show polls droves November vote Trump? Missed /s? feel bad this. honestly never thought would ever reaction people general fight greater good. would like think leadership expresses firmly guidelines would follow them. HOWEVER, know reality asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”-Nice guessing won’t get first place gonna eat stuff....be safe wear mask etc think everyone overreacting. like anyone DYING anything. Oh, wait... LOL lives? even serious right now? debt loan sharks? Even going bankrupt land ahead lot Americans student loan debt. yet, drive pick prescription passed bar excess 300 people, Detroit Ave area Lakewood looked like Bourbon Street. fucked. started rise power 1785 dad died, yes started artillery, rose quickly ranks.

The press secretary denounced/debunked shit weeks ago. sorry, can't take anybody says seriously. fundamentally wrong. He's also shocked daily sun still warm there's that. Fucking moron. here. Shucks. part though weve recovered well take seriously, mom works grocery store never seen ""MUH FREEDOM"" people people wear without nose covered even remove talk her. Otherwise, weve great always idiots Interesting comments say actual cases much higher may 10x confirmed cases always downvoted. Almost like want people come information know that. religion cremation. pro-birthers care birth. baby born give shit mother baby anything else. governing official could lead states everyone would page. Success lives? Get grip reality dude. mean yeah, given information should’ve totally looked NY travel Europe, that’s looking past current information. inexcusable total number deaths sending sick patients nursing homes. something never done made situation lot worse needed lockdowns same... Florida locked like NY again. Serious brain damage one. Amazing article. It’s painful read though. Makes clear government corrupt case anyone doubts. Little everyone know (some did) swamp brought in.

It’s going take miracle get us tailspin in, 100% caused corrupt failed leadership 100% focused reelection.

“...perhaps one greatest failures presidential leadership generations.”

This spot on. God, people Government need held liable. done (is done, still) criminal. knowingly allow citizens country die, know full well potentially hundreds thousands come fall/winter... still nothing - punishment big enough, he’ll cannot hot enough make done. It’s funny educated certain level prove skills jobs qualifies idiots like govern us? serious re-evaluation political system promotes/elects people like governor. edit original comment still amazes we're still basic level trying convince people fake ... stage pandemic. telling people day. brainwashed supporting country blindly. invaded iraq nothing 9/11 nothing never wmd. turn country shit show million dead civilians didnt blink eye. manipulated thinking 140 thousand dead Americans acceptable. forget Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, think Malaysia handful others also able keep numbers down/low. 🎵 beautiful

No matter say

Words can't bring 🎶 last week crucial feel like local leaders failed us allowing NY stay open apparent watching Italy heading. DiBlasio refusing close schools, Cuomo delaying shut down... costs many lives. personally know handful people got sick week alone. How's virus NY now? Give Big Gretch Whitmer $20 bill. couldn’t prouder her. going happen still enough GOP members prevent that. could literally break every law books damnedest prevent it. deadly disease kills people? Wow. knew? Oh! No! I’m NYC think completely page. There's chance vaccine result worse reaction versus nothing all. real chance. 

that's true, long chance, *any* chance it'll grant protection matter else might you, chance getting protection increases vs taking it. logic math.Even 90% chance something bad 5% chance protecting chances protection still increased +5% taking it, cancel out. Even end protecting all, even ends making susceptible virus *chances* protection still improved. Increasing odds gaurntee outcome. mask usage absolutely correlation covid case count. proven all.

Places like Africa, Eastern Europe, Middle East low mask usage, also low covid cases.

Covid obviously correlated dense urban populationd, eventually goes major city world matter restrictions mask usage. musing concept today, really feel censor much reality. terrible would be, it'd probably help combat virus deniers made thing visible. example, showing actual bodies loaded refrigerated trucks... hide death effectively. makes unimaginable people see eyes, another beautiful sunny day.

But we'd probably get people blubbering crisis actors family. Ugh. reading much heavily paid articles Western dailies anti Modi journalists, Lux? born Beijing, 35 years old, lived 35 years.
You think meet Chinese guy, you?  I’m things “Gov announces fuck-all” Time close hospitals then! *Impossible* first step good liar believe lies. Confidence key. shit can't smell like roses wholeheartedly believe that's roses smell like.  Ok, know NDP super left party Canada what’s UCP? stand Alberta? American i’m trying learn politics countries anything would appreciated! deserve it, suck specie I'm fan gotta admit right call. live VT, definitely say we've handled quite well. Despite lowest number cases country, almost everyone see still wears mask indoors, businesses still require it. Phill Scott, governor, done excellent job managing it. happens Republican I've ever voted for, he's well known working across aisle. We've expanded free COVID testing, open entire public easy sign online. 

I however worried colleges reopening fall. lot flatlanders going coming up, difficult enforce quarantine. Damn, covid-19 goin viral! I'm young person care, problem fucking power, old c*nt office cronies trying spin rainbow get re-elected, young person thing, sure get dumb fucks go party, put strict lockdown fines disobeying it'll fine, put restrictions place? older generations fucking charge.



 Fuck AMERICA SUCKS ASS 3RD WORLD COUNTRY 1ST WORLD SHELL call Oklahoma! disturbed America go complete shit quick one anything it. thought built little sturdy things like happen Ideally, people ought staying away people \*don't\* wear masks, unless think wearing mask indicator someone likely infected. I'm sympathetic this, 'surviving' COVID relative term. pleasant many 'survive.' list permanent injuries disabilities neither short pleasant. boring shit Vermont. Lived 8 years family lives still.

Beautiful, duuuuuuuuull. cost living insane rural is--I currently live major city west way cheaper VT. hard find jobs well lack cities major manufacturing. Food sucks (the good things dairy beer, get literally ethnic food quality go state), though least that's getting better slowly.

VT looks good paper unless already pretty wealthy fun place live. poor actually terrible place live (my mom social worker low-income clients ROUGH there). Live NY go visit every then.

Interestingly, city live TON transplants VT every one I've spoken desperate get Vermont live someplace could actually find job enjoy Thai food occasionally. Vermont really place young people. North Korea? Yep. That’s NY teachers did. Oh god see Applebee’s commercial one time. “Welcome back America. missed you”. Yeah, it’s missed. It’s money. think Arizona cases country per capita pretty shortly I've read COVID-19 antibodies wear months infection. mean developing vaccine likely futile?

I'm genuinely worried pandemic might permanent, current way life—social distancing, wearing mask, complete isolation infected—will become intermittent reality rest lives. chance finding definitive cure? Unless you’re FL/TX/AZ lol Fucking idiot gov don’t sacrifice goat it. Look comments thread; top comments attribute ""success"" fighting covid19 far ruralness... really rural. *are* rural, braindead morons thinking I'm challenging quality, ruralness *nothing* like Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Alaska, etc. look states, see *highest* concentration covid19 population centers, thoe areas.

People thread developing dangerous attitude, rural areas safe covid19. needs corrected, pretty much matter cost is. Vermont *not* safe covid19 we're rural. We're safe all. fact, we're high-speed rail disaster. regulations? ran numbers Minnesota someone outside cities told cities problem.

About 37% cases state outside MSP metro area. That's roughly population state lives outside MSP area. means virus affecting areas same. Here's thing, though, Trump literally threaten martial law NY. Cuomo literally called act war. end March.

Let's real. Americans source dumb conspiracy Tell much, doesn’t carry bill smaller $50 somehow still owes state $50,000 lot cowards. [This Rolling Stone week ago serveral Republican consultants spoke record includes one particularly startling “There practical realities — ran bunch red district primaries, would come back number one issue 80+% Republican primary voters loyalty Donald Trump.

North Umatilla County Washington they've protesting local sheriff gave impassioned speech wearing masks, telling crowd sheep.

They need help. want help. want help go away. Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan using face mask since day 1, experts, researchers, doctors vouch benefits covid19 spreading there? Spoilers: did. West brushed away.

Edit: Let put comparison.

\- 9/11 happened 3k casualties public names *biggest intelligence failure*.

\- COVID19 wreck havoc US 142k deaths, despite 2 months head start, public calls *lack government leadership*.

\- CDC/Head surgeon/Trump made wrong bet, failed recommend face masks/covers, actively bad mouthed months despite vast amounts intelligence multiple countries East; causing unknown amounts preventable deaths people excuses *it's okay ""we got information"" now--that's life*.

I'm American, find baffling. think 95% humans, empathy fellow humans pushes self isolation irrespective government policy negates stupidity 5%. 5% usually young mortality stats reflect behaviour.

In saying that, 5% allowed keep spreading virus, virus go away quickly explode rest population relaxes.

We seen first hand Australia dam thing control singular lapse 1 month ago restrictions lifted caused spread like wildfire Melbourne. city hard lockdown again. spread another city single truck driver visiting pub there, city likely going lockdown too. effectively place close 40% population back lockdown cripple 50% economy.

Nobody wants get sick way nobody wants die car crash yet people still drive cars seatbelts order minimize risk death.

As long people wear masks wash hands, life able resume way opposite, nation turmoil control pandemic, we’re distracted, watching bullshit they’re goes Trump thinks suppress voter turn states haven’t gained “herd immunity” Election Day. Bonus, meanwhile, much harder protest we’re various versions lockdown.

Or hey maybe standing orders Putin decimate country whatever means. know, Trump racking massive brownie points Moscow assfucks Divided States oblivion.

At juncture, Trump resorted claiming coronavirus isn’t actually bad: “Many cases young people would heal day. sniffles put test. Many — forget, guess like 99.7 percent, people going get better many cases they’re going get better quickly.”

Aka fake news get tested? Nashville!  Ding ding ding. summed pretty perfect right there. pretty much caveman logic. Democracy good. Communism bad. know capitalism is. 

It's bit harsh seriously. Ever since pandemic whole ""I wanna pay lazy. Go get job"" rhetoric sky high. think saw every dime taxes went unemployed taking all. would likely military spending one ready talk. 

I actually become understanding unemployment fault own. unemployed months. Yes make people work harder pay portion back taxes. without health insurance.

Sidenote that's unrelated..I also understand people abuse system here. took months get approved. without extra money government given us. would homeless. wild. pandemic really made question every aspect u.s. stank face Huh, didn’t cross mind I’d like read personal accounts happening.

What suppliments on? 

I got vitamin C, zinc, fish oil there...  melatonine, vitamin (when felt safe tske doses, due possible cytokine aspect want get immune system hyped up) make sure got sunbathing window morning. ginger tea there, chamomille lavender relax. CBD helping lot lately physical psychological relief, managed get anxiety order CBD almost flatlines bit that's nice. plenty people; they're NEK. NEK fairly isolated, geographically: closed border canada north, sparsely populated white mountains east, major roads directly connecting Burlington.

Most importantly, governor republican plays dumb games republican plays. mask mandate. schools reopening. literally vetoed paid family/medical leave vermont. idea people give much benefit doubt. figure lot rationalize desire appear partisan. feel confident debunking ostensible intelligence scott charge.

opposite NEK north, Burlington small, still fairly dense, 256 people per sq. mile. protected north canada's border, west giant lake, east lack roads.

NEK Burlington vulnerability; south, indeed rural part state, Bennington &amp; Windham counties. Bennington, southwestern corner, protected well green mountains lack important roads. Brattleboro, right southeastern corner southeastern Windham, right next Keene right I91. means covid19 really one effective vector Vermont... slows virus. stopped virus.

... case, discussion vermont's ""rural"" quality goes straight fucking window tourism season starts, compounded lack mask mandate, compounded schools reopening, compounded workers lacking paid family/medical leave. people thread know much vermont think do. ChilDRen IMmunE! Yep. It’s uniquely weird dynamic isn’t it? Closest feeling getting Covid-19 breathing pure CO2. pain, confusion/fear, inability breath, near death experience experience get severe form symptoms. I've experienced this, panic immediate. Never want experience again. UC Davis:  Duh. Hospitals get paid admit everyone ICU covid. know people broken bone stayed hospital weeks ICU Covid. Hospital got free government money. /S isn’t Trump said. Trump ignored Fauci many others calling hoax well Fauci others learned virus. Trump completely given Fauci desperately trying save lives. Always  many states (I honestly thought them) lose unemployment refuse go back without good reason like cut pay/hours half offered different job can’t physically etc. cities still bars open? Crazy. Trump taken side coronavirus. What? Kanye spent already?  parents fault. schools really pressure making sure kids school time. Always rallying behind attendance numbers. sick days need doctor's note even tho needed days get better. reinfection due patient’s Covid antibodies disappearing, would assume case ADE wouldn’t concern. understand ADE antibodies remain, reinfection actually due slightly different strain virus antibodies bind unable fully neutralize. 

Of course, I’m expert I’d love someone knows stuff chime in!  get it. slippery slope, obligations. Old habits slide easily. There's doubt another round stimulus, unemployment borrower protections need happen ASAP. looks like GOP pretty determined force people unhealthy situations instead protecting though, control 2.5 3 branches federal government. terrible, existential crisis type feeling zero credible leadership White House. We're experiencing unofficial second Civil War rich vs. poors --- pretty one-sided. essential rest. Without you, literally cannot jobs

Well.. without them, they'll hire someone else job.

Far fewer people could doctor, means valued more. here. Don’t get wrong, rarely argued quarantine arguments pretty petty lol that, we’re happily home together. still separate hobbies, meals together watch shows together, etc. I’m happy say we’ve enjoying time together. 

But also important factor, think. Dealing depression person one supporting hard. I’m surprised that’s taking toll relationships well time. everything Russia, probably fake, researchers pressure issue vaccine soon possible. putting countries military risk disease? refuse job? acts traitor. Haha keep making excuses can't improve. came trailer court, I've chosen future living family trash successful it. talking wrong person, I've done it. anyone doubted negative test results? convinced 3 4 months ago accessible testing US. people fiancé’s work got recently got tested. waiting results extremely mild symptoms. Nausea, fatigue, throat feels swollen. convinced test results came back negative. guess I’m worried maybe got like smallest intake small won’t show tests, maybe fact I’m 99% sure I’ve wonder it’s body body used fighting maybe effected test somehow.

I don’t go work three days I’m paranoid test wrong don’t really know do. wrong thinking way? ever question? think kids tend asymptomatic often ever thought spread it? wish info virus, safe. Essentially yes... IMO wanted help people needed wanted donate white charity see problem.

That said—if high profile person like Kaepernick—you would likely face strong backlash, even worse Kaepernick facing here. It’s clear Kaepernick made donation ‘black brown’ communities thinks need hundreds years racism held communities back (which supported many figures meant gauge quality life e.g. income).

Would make decision Kaepernick? Probably not. good he’s outweigh bad? Assuredly, opinion. managed it? stuff stay closed lot longer US? mask use? people think education inequality now, wait till feel full effect shit. 

As soon shit went wife hired private tutor work son. school would assign work via email tutor would work lessons son via discord.

My son fortunate means ensure gets quality education, kids parents give shit much less means hire private tutor. kids fucked.

Liberals smashing Trump head issue, yet see assholes offer viable solution. Fucking duh. expand further, NYC arguably super city US metro population 20 million definitely going get hit hard pandemic. Even LA 13 million distant second. I'd agree NY initially slow react, react took significant action get cases deaths down. good position continue re-opening. state large outbreak look states reigned spread virus learn control it. Deaths dont magically stop happening own.  Probably also cheaters discovered it’s harder use excuses work trips nights guys hide affairs. Dewine refused make wearing face mask mandatory. Dewine turned coward would take radical right. put hopes reelection safety Ohio citizens. Went Walmart today... 100% masks.

Next door bass pro shop. 66% masks.

Fuck Desantis, fuck anyone wear mask. Keep saying enough people get idea, even gets deleted least :) like golden showers hold Covid Party.. mean he's right. Nobody sick everyone's dead. Yea, hospitals hot spots maxed out. don’t know solution though, like ship NH patients 5 states away either ambulance corps overwhelmed too. I’m nurse NYC don’t think hospitals even upstate (way upstate) would want take bunch NYC covid patients put communities risk. easy solution easy feat. Vote mail literally heard every one things listed! don’t get comparison, JFK Jr didn’t go Harvard Law. point Harvard Law produces lot quality lawyers, undergraduate program. DeSantis probably least book smart. earth would compare JFK Jr? think administrations lived anything lawless really paying attention... I'm actually glad Trump woken people like horrible things become country. I'm scared might go back sleep Biden gets elected though. boss gave approval create hybrid course. 

Yeah, ok, troll. honestly can’t believe stakeholders university education blaming teachers.

Good know put virtual words mouth. watch interview Sarah Gilbert (Professor virology Oxford vaccine creator) nearly two weeks ago, says need see minimum 30 infected got either vaccine meningitis vaccine Oxford. happens, look see virus effective based many people got placebo tested positive compared many people got real vaccine. really, Brazil could happen fast. Big thing here: prove effective first distributed. It’s already proven safe it’s using viral vector already shown safe.
What mean say is... could ready late August thanks testing Brazil. won’t say 50 healthcare workers phase III participants get COVID-19 50 given meningitis vaccine able see quickly works. seem remember 10 days story published, sent work home returned. wonder changed advice? right, probably not. gave view matter change new information comes light would contradictory, hypocritical frankly un-American. 130,000x times many deaths published mean change habits. Sometimes brand new disease happens twice death toll Vietnam 7 months. happens. deserve hobbies demand luxurious comfort. right American. that's website [the Austin major newspaper Austin TX, form other, nearly 150 years

unlike Dallas Morning News Houston Chronicle, AA-S rarely breaks big news itself; sure cover Legislature Governor's press briefings, every major paper Texas plus TV stations &amp; web-only publications like Texas Tribune Texas Observer. 

among locals, paper's common nickname ""the Austin Real Estatesman"" often &amp; enthusiastically paper rolls local business interests come play Well seems pretty fucking shortsighted. ""We think would get bad, want cause mass panic."" Um, ok, yea. That's exactly Trump said, absolutely ripped apart. also almost 50 years ago. Tell listening professionals!? decision kill kids made individual ... ""EXPERT"" washington, state, city, another country.

&amp;#x200B;

I want damn kids house. NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

/s nit picking statement, think narrowed incubation period 5 days now.  Yes. elephants bungled last opportunity wash orange dust trunks. need opportunities make right. confirm. Daughter got measles despite immunized. sickest seen (and compromised immune system I’ve seen sick lot). Well makes feel better county California highest amount cases we’re even LA. *Riverside, dead pile high!* 

Also hometown Huntington? Basically South Pacific. I-I- can’t break dude.  governor California them. made masks mandatory made social distancing mandatory. locked entire state again. 

Which it? masks social distancing work, need lockdown? lockdowns work, need masks? 

For moment I'm leaving aside fact governor coward anything anyone says long shove tit mouth. someone tells me, aware vaccine released September doesn’t mean pandemic ends September. 

Just know, vaccine released Septmeber MEAN pandemic ends September!!!

/s “It shown employees plastic visors infected. single infection among employees mask.” 

What type mask wearing? Cloth, surgical, KN95? masks protect person wearing mask. goes education sector. run department school district. technicians probably encounter students daily basis teachers. classrooms schools day every day. wear face face shield enough. Another person replied already this. Holland study linked good science specific, small part world, match studies show children contracting spreading it.

I read study yesterday CDC saying 12-19 year olds susceptible getting spreading Covid adults are. Holland study stating high school students don’t need 1.5 meters distancing doesn’t apply areas world lack strong humble national leadership. Inconsistent policy federal government, finger pointing federal state local government. Arrogent leaders thought pandemic going happen third world countries still refused admit reality US handling worse third world countries learn mistakes.

Lack community level unity guidance. many Karens neighborhood. contact tracing. China's Europe's fault gets better worse put people respirators. Smokers experience COVID better worse non-smokers, according studies. 

Notably, New York City, worst outbreak country far, also best handling virus, according Dr. Fauci.

The virus stay, need flatten curve spread infections overwhelm healthcare system we've reached herd immunity. new cases every day, need stay lockdown. People literally dying, need stay locked people stop dying.

Russia hacking vaccine. Anonymous sources 17 intelligence agencies confirmed definitely saw Fancy Bears hacking vaccines.  Lol breaking news headline makes sound like middle schoolers achieved something great live one county work another. residence hotspot- mandate. weird thing county work still mandate Somebody works lab press release. 12 weeks late Many others thread line said deliberately lied fired shouldn’t trusted moving forward.

But believe heard say, many others didn’t think would get bad didn’t want cause panic. possible pandemics didn’t require entire nation wear face masks. one clearly different, Fauci also said, “my worst nightmare came true”, something effect. giant swaths nothing balance out. 

the giant swaths nothing ""balance"" out, overwhelmingly topple scale favor ""rural"" density population.

In case; fact population evenly distributed would work us covid19 counts. rural areas rural enough stop virus dead tracks, like deserts Nevada mountains Wyoming. People thread understand ""rural"" vermont ""rural"" nevada two **totally** different things, matter belligerently obvious is.

My real problem argument completely ignores fact covid19 proven *more* capable spreading rural suburban areas. take look state's maps NYT. cities. low cases per capita little ruralness. 

... case, literally anybody knows basically anything vermont knows ton tourism. benefit ruralness gives us, real imagined, obviously fly window leaves change color, towns crowded anywhere else country. I've giving people thread much credit; really know single damn thing state.    don’t use Snapchat googled wow aren’t kidding. Saw party bunch dudes throwing money three strippers Riverside, CA. invoke megachuch Catholic priest pedo, remember Stalin Hitler atheists.

what fuck sentence, religious nuts literally insane lol True, Toulouse also I'm seeing masks everywhere local town (~2k inhabitants) even village - there's small shop owner let anyone without mask. Cities adherence important obviously preferable everybody pulls weight. Hypernormalisation good doc sound knowledge

Like multiple doctors quoted link provided? inevitable result allowing go long. needed strict two-month national lockdown. Instead half-assed “lockdown” businesses closed weeks elected officials downplayed virus undermined precautions.

I know lot introverts able socially distance friends family 18 months. people aren’t wired like that, two months isolation handle. initial (lazy, inadequate, poorly coordinated) lockdown already exhausted patience virus really reached home community. one shot lockdown, blew it. People going keep getting together get sick. I'm sure much innovation. looks like made deleted breathe valve. pointing butt? 2% 330,000,000 6,600,000. used commas could comprehend large numbers needs meme think Hawaii state doesn’t least one Walmart. trump... trump someone be? totally trumping himself. Actual ""leftists"" know (especially live New York) hate Cuomo think awful job.

But probably using leftist shorthand liberal chuds. #unnecessaryracism maybe video record accounts send twitter customer service? put dick toaster shocked came burns seem care much that? difficult seeing that? 99% level stress Clearly open schools ASAP let science stand way. /s Actually low voluntary mask usage boonies, matters little there. thinking there's chance would reach 3 digits anytime soon. think today. Looks like we're nowhere near end. fact still local transmissions means finally beat it. unfortunate, coz think might get cases again.

Also, see lot people wearing masks anymore. masks mandatory, especially public places? Hoping NED next scan. It’s believed picked Covid 3 year cancer scans I’m still cancer free yay. reading Spanish flu pandemic:

No, think humanity get even question, taiwan able control COVID using social distancing masks, shutdown.  specidic examples ""corruption murderous incompetence"" ? 60 million Americans got h1n1 obama nothing. biden follows science sudden? started boring, getting somewhat entertaining. Keep talking... reality elective dictatorship.  Piggly Wiggly hometown since like 1940s something. saw old picture one like ""WTF that?"" Keep testing though! need cases election! wearing N95 prolonged periods HCP appropriately fit-tested it? used wear N95 hours hours, day. annoying (tightness seal, anything) long appropriate size shape, fine breathing.

A CLOTH MASK FINE. Find one comfortable. Wear surgical mask, comfy. Wear Tshirt mask. ideal, work. cover damn droplets best can. N95 appropriate mask people general public, esp. trained sized. why. work service industry job, likely come contact someone covid. Also, likely targeted anti-mask idiots ""don't like look."" 

This literally concept talked public health called health disparities. major falling best friend. still goes parties bartends engages types dangerous, selfish behavior whole experience shown true colors. Right middle pandemic wanting begin defunding? Trump special kind asshole. Theyre already 142,000 old article. come wrong sub fuck still questioned? know works asian data I'm stylist, following story two COVID positive stylists, saw 100 clients getting test results. clients became infected stylist client wore masks. story helped go back work. Yup masks uncomfortable.... unfortunately pandemic need wear them. Also please utilize common sense like don’t wear N95 mask hours car yourself.... doesn’t work anyway Move next disaster USA also cannot handle due detoriation leadership, politics sensibility population. Yes can, don’t come Vermont, learned everything learned school, go there. E z PZ.  Perhaps he's USA 🙂 8 year old kid church asked worried covid. responded ""no, die I'll go live jesus sooner"".

This kid going places!  didn’t life mapped age! Well, acted progressive got rona, technically Pwned lib, still end ? enough people would never use would render useless. sick flu hospitalized. Caught another parent decided send sick kid son’s daycare. felt like dying owed thousands medical bills. Oh, also 7 months pregnant 1-year-old caught too. 

Even it’s corona, stay F home.  bait make us say something racist. far, Covid-19 blessing introverts. God tragedy. mess state.

Here's Florida's latest numbers charts last curves, lot tragedy coming. clear, people aren’t complaining pandemic. They’re complaining culture people leaving houses tickle throat. 

These people aren’t talking now. want everyone houses forever tickle throat. lot people subconsciously want end world.  many old enough stay home without child care. single debate I've seen schools reopening mentioned option different options based age. testing virus, that's part infuriating national trend. lol dumb american Ah yes, study claims net increase social distancing people stayed home. way, even true, there's indication protests *themselves* spread disease.

I mean, seriously, use brain. I'm sure intelligent person. really believe mass gatherings people pandemic spread disease? (X) Doubt One biggest issues is, kids 15 25 close enough immune statistically justified thinking so. people worried something one thousand chance happening. Unfortunately, odds change dramatically increase age. havent spent time friends like since March. wrong child-like people? Grow fuck felt obsession surfaces ridiculous start thing, globally. I'm medical professional. seems ridiculous respiratory virus.

In US, dumb CDC screwed everything focusing everyone hand washing (wtf) saying masks crazy. stupid. Tbh require someone good sound knowledge rather abuse really. explanation. good. fuck em. cruise industry needs die permanently. IFR fluid based age whether outbreaks happened nursing homes, whether hospitals overwhelmed, reliability antibody tests, many factors.

Not organization, study results: 

British data age: (Click IFR tab)

Spanish data age: estimated IFR based seroprevalence 0.38-0.73% males 0.20-0.39% females non-nursing home population (non-NHP), 0.79-1.52% males 0.88-1.31% females entire population. variable I'm sure does, factors he/she mentioned contribute willingness wear School. many big words cult. also much, much densely populated area US whole. 11-year-old boy Miami-Dade County died Covid-19 ... Health, making youngest person state Florida die disease

this 2 weeks ago took 5 seconds google search Soviet Russia, vaccine finds you! post creepiness pledge. alone!  USA pretends democracy.  anyone orange manchild ever claim reopening increase cases? course will. matter whether think reopening indoor masking + hygiene precautions + physically isolating elderly better option staying locked virus statistically unlikely kill people age 65. That’s it’s school... It’s daycare! Math teacher here. Last spring online learning teaching exponential growth used Covid-19 example. showed diagram cases doubling showed happens overall number take people spread early (social distancing). Also explained something look linear early really ends exponential.

I got kids going ""holy crap need stay home"". wish adults could figure out. Title: ""Replaces N95""

Article: ""Uses N95"" ...I've never worked anywhere 100% work force suffering allergies, fine, compromise, change 50% calling 75%.

Eventually, things done properly, spread Covid drop maybe we'll develop vaccine. let ask, would rather able everything fully stock due sick workers dead ones? choice making go completely black white want every worker show tickle throat pandemic common symptoms conditioned ignore thanks decades coming tickles throats. Yes N95s hard breathe through, pretty much everyone. nobody supposed wear public talk “masks”. get it, even regular cloth surgical masks course mask-less. Skinny dipping also 10x better wearing bathing suit. right easy thing ensure parts normal infrastructure operate. 
And following ones can’t bothered wear one because: hard. un-American. principle mask me! 
Too many don’t give shit don’t kids don’t huge dilemma handle school, fall cold/flu season jobs. injected bullets back head? Whoah, hold ~~horses~~ *Hoaxes* That’s serious Alien vs Predator shit right there. see year long horror show nightmare ends... one seasonal viruses holds COVID-19 long enough vaccine.. Biden wins election, Trump carted jail... Ahh, great hear! Yeah, let's hope stays fine :)

(Sorry late reply, suddenly quite busy) Interested see plays Starbucks every Target wearing one since March. Feels like everyone jumped bandwagon late, including myself. Yep yep Facts usually disproven Thanks, American Mapleland. Ok n95 mask use work. probably using surgical masks really. Definitely! look container B&amp;J’s Phish Food, cow wearing mumu like Fishman (the drummer) wears every concert! Don’t go Barre! listen science. *you* see coronavirus situation? Probably 285,000 infections per day three weeks before. missing infections. ~0.7% death rate 2000 x 143 = ~285,000 infections per day. bartender last six years quit industry cold turkey since. can’t get amount selfish behavior I’m seeing around bars right gives serious anxiety.

All want go back school get masters degree, schools closed. happens millions unemployed people around world laid time compete one another significantly less jobs, less customers, less purchasing power? nightmare. interesting stats got religion part. Can’t paint broad brush like that. Thank giving proper information giving tirade abuse. There's shocker. Airborne transmission, stays viable surfaces kids dunna get it. Damn science, damn you. dare spread liberal views. racism right? anti lockdown protesters anti mask [shouting faces police](http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/column/the-screaming-american-patriot-is-a-portrait-of-how-the-individualist-movement-has-failed/) armed, went unchallenged. demonstrate visible bias people treated US, showed politics enabled people act irresponsibly rewarded power.

It’s disingenuous imply attitudes behaviours two groups same, they’re clearly not. anti lockdown protesters anti science, selfish largely self harming. BLM protesters made mandate advocate masks social distancing. that, movement literally compassion consideration fellow humans.

At point read hear anyone tell masks singular defence anything. conversation always revolves around giving people personal space wearing mask protection. Working together closely, yelling, bunking cramped conditions, travelling work together. would put money refrigerated air.

&amp;#x200B;

Many factors much likely role meat itself. Pennsylvania government alright. distressingly large chunk residents hand.... much Lol act like new situation never happened before. Vacuum bags worst breathability needed considering using filtration system. air cannot easily pass material, pulled area surrounding filter. problem Christ.

Christians, hand. Whooo boy! appreciate level headedness wish people would like you. Another study people concluded that, every 60 seconds Africa, minute passes. 

They're track win Nobel prize absolute fucking dumbshit-ness. Lol don’t move here. Life long Vermonter it’s NIGHTMARE trying buy house. Everyone else keeps buying sight unseen since it’s safe here! Jk totally move we’d love :) Theists.. taught whole life simply redefine reality wishful thinking, enemy

People think viruses climate change political opinions.. corporations people.. cutting taxes help economy.. Jesus actually existed.. world end firey judgement -- they're ones ruining rest us Well, suppose good news rest world.

Russia effectively going conduct Phase 3 testing injecting virus millions Russians. Meanwhile, rest us wait see whether works whether terrible side effects. someone willingly try. there's data hopefully next time data influence choices. way look right this. assume flimsy election rigged machines corrupt Putin 2.0 gonna save us potentially live hellish life dictatorship, OR, fight try restore normalcy. virus contained point anyway. current government massive threat. Putin 2.0 destroy election virus chaos said polling centers. intentional. protest, shitty police, police going get violent riot. sucks, that's we're at. Police riots. Welcome 2020. say everyone. We're controlled minority right now. think filthy little disease spreaders. Absolutely Multiple areas already created free low-cost meal services students distance learning. also [options offline students without internet home.

There reason teachers' parents' lives need directly endangered order provide service, suggesting. People absolutely die Trump administrations current, persistent poor decision-making. isn’t going easy - it’s either shitty online education, lots inconvenience school, major outbreaks. Choices suck. BLM protesters? I'm tired people knowing said it. 

He said seen slide showed disinfect/clean surfaces minute decided solution body.

You're idiot railing against. South African, knowing anthem flag colours Bushmen words coat arms mean far get. Bars restaurants open inside dining drinking. Since impossible wear mask drink eat. going take bite, put mask, chew, swallow, pull mask, take another bite, put mask, etc., etc.. citing places mask violations stupid, close indoor dining outright. 

And bar association person saying crack people drinking streets illegally....where think people getting alcohol ""take out"" liquor.

Just close bars, people drink home easily. Close restaurants anything outside dining curbside take out. 

Yes, owners going take hit financially. everyone else. going get worse let thing continue spread.

If we'd close everything self isolate two weeks we'd beat. going anything grocery shopping mask required 100% outside home vehicle. Suck pay everyone Unemployment two weeks. point knocked enough masks social distancing fully gone. 

But US many idiots think hoax conspiracy. much ""Freedom"" wear mask 'Murica.... think it’s because, least us old enough comprehend, 9/11 really caused Americans unite common enemy. COVID response shows fractured country we’ve become. doubt. I'm thinking national mandate asked. people lot closer 6 feet. ""About half company's 253 stores located Michigan, half Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Wisconsin.""

From wiki I'm shocked. Shocked say. big problem imo mainly unequal representation Senate.

But Coronavirus response, comparing us western countries really done things much differently europe? really, many countries still universal mask orders mainly public transport distancing possible. Germany real standout case organized thorough response, they're ones well there. think seasonal patterns behavior, europe northern us summer drives people outside, southern us drives inside. watched guy tell underpaid Meijer manager mask invisible would drag store never wearing muzzle... waiting national unified response. Barring that, want news linked local outbreak. think Burlington handle college kids come back (speaking one them) different state changing. Many based enrollment now, daily attendance seems weird say, ""the math simple"", provide figure actually fall math No, artificially created prejudice dating back late USSR. guy demonstrates that. 1. Dont wish death anyone.

2. economy allowed crash, probably living martial law right death toll would probably 10 times Covid death toll is. Illinois! Shhh. Stop telling us things. stop figuring things true!  S/ Can’t wait today unknown long term harms disease kick in. /s 
Hundreds thousands children health problems parents can’t afford treatment one. Great. Disneyland open again, hooray! problem solved paid sick leave. We'd take lot things seriously understood like die kind death. really sucks, everyone outcome.

It's really lottery people draw short straw.

Most people end hospital ICU.

Two friends, couple, got it. They're late 30s/early 40, guy skinny, woman overweight. symptoms, mainly loss smell taste, recovered lasting effects. fear late anyone thinks ""masks anything"" use new data choose wear one. Americans want learn (and generous), heard late Feb/early March ""Oh effective,"" it. conversation mom day, went ""we keep getting told something different!"" I'm like, course are! BRAND NEW virus, learning almost quickly people researching this. Fucking listen know continue learn thing. love many folk really embraced inner parrot. virus doesn’t care.     
   
You can’t negotiate communicable disease.
    
Hanging groups even small groups gives opportunity find new host pretty well.    
    

     
      
If everyone masks March wouldn’t 140,000+ dead thousands come. (South Korea reported first case day US did. less 300 dead. masked contact traced early on. not).      
Unified leadership needed. Didn’t get it. are.   
    
If want visit family it’s life theirs.   
As long accept risk roll dice together they’re lives.    
   
If want take kids visit grandparents reduce risk could self isolate family group 2 weeks, get test clear safely visit would think?   
How handle risk family group manageable everyone group careful lives regards disease.  
     
This vascular disease understand.   
And long term health issues yet determined.   
God help us long term health issues millions going it.  
Best part experiment possible. Well still think makes sense, least changed ""worse"" ""as bad"" instantly pushed office. Fucking coward. think said people still fighting symptoms even worse 3-4 months initially got infected You’d surprised many people think kids things. people age group willing risk lung damage even death continue vaping. 

I don’t think necessarily concern young people even could cause long term damage. assure hand that, ever see anything like ground occurring. spent close 20 months ground foot patrol every single day. triangle death birthed ISIS Syrian border, Sinjar Mtns, Ports Entry. Never ever see Americans butchering anything. Though fully aware occur bad actors. something would watched allowed either, Iraqis saved life got seperated patrol. would died time. proof that, except officers daughter? Shocker American never thought pledge. something teacher said thought kids pledge flag countries young. observed younger children appear spread readily adults. point force driving schools open. Saying middle high schoolers able spread well adults pushes back upper grades opening. saying Russians, Kazakks, Uzbeks, etc. can't make minds medicines pharmacies instead rely redditors say it? ""None work enough everyone!"" Yeah know else 100% sure living greatest country Earth? North Koreans. also, smart make leader. probably simp bedroom workplace. afraid alone — Would take pandemic seriously understood it’s like die COVID-19 death?

No. Republican party drawn line sand. Covid 19 dangerous. Covid 19 democratic hoax. Covid 19 Chinese bio-weapon. Masks work, gloves work, social distancing wussy libtards.

Short one minder every Republican physically holding mask faces, can't force people believe *the germ theory disease.* Lol, story [been domestic transmission international since early lots Europeans go Florida, it’s cheap safe warm-weather destination, mention theme parks even Europeans like.

[Almost half US deaths linked nursing homes, NY’s contribution suspected bipartisan group lawmakers much higher reported discharge orders like NY saw much higher nursing home death rates states follow NY’s lead States issued orders similar Cuomo’s recorded comparably grim outcomes. Michigan lost 5% roughly 38,000 nursing home residents COVID-19 since outbreak began. New Jersey lost 12% 43,000 Florida, transfers barred, 1.6% 73,000 nursing home residents died virus. California, initially moving toward policy like New York’s, quickly revised it. far, lost 2% 103,000 nursing home residents.


Meanwhile, [Florida’s COVID Daily death toll current surge cases 1/10th New thought given. push people move Vermont work remotely. Southern Vermont pretty cheap homes places specifically looking nicer apartments professionals live small city. he's also concerned healthy diet?? know, learn guy... implying virus check ID? Oh goodness poor thing weak diaphragm can’t breathe tiny piece fabric covering mouth?! gosh maybe you’ll really suffering catch AIRBORNE VIRUS DECIMATES LUNGS KILLS I’m sure it’s shape said nose, get tickled think imagery description nose invokes. Vaccine fell patients.  Education happen remotely. delayed. Funds prioritized towards unable work, improve quality remote learning. sacrifice anyone. young catch , spread it, others. Including elderly. virus care opinions education, infects kills. must necessary stop it. ""civilized"" mean ""western"" yeah, sure, even yet another example true ""western values"" bias sub actually hilarious. 15/hr great wage anymore. Maybe 20 years ago would've easy live on. know Target pays 15/hr? Also im guessing live rural area based housing prices. Makes sense cant find people work lower population areas always though ""leaked"" porn video quite clever. right time history that.

However read Wikipedia seems calculated move her. Oh got it, read title like wait! Coronavirus Trump 2020 going touch first point-but, definitely ways deal second point

again guess kids learn read home alone. Oh God username bonanza episode? Lack education, manipulated propaganda religion, ignorance, fear, stupidity. race, different mental capacity. Likewise. gauge diameter sociopolitical aneurysm that's way. point going school listen educated important? know people Ohio think whole states problem hoax propagated liberals videos hospitals full back stupidity.

So reason states dont take note NYC dont really believe happened. Note hospital bed icu capacity that's changed data routing. case counts part order cells require glucose lack mechanism use ketone bodies fuel

Which cells those? OMG still Youtube comment thread guy said kill 40k people (worldwide) we're 600k! update every month jerk Totally there. 

I also like signage everywhere sick stay home, okay; soon do, management starts going must care lot job, many job applications coming right now. 

The 'we care workers customers health' line, also threatening worker's livelihood try take care others... quite infuriating. sad. minimum schools temperature checks, even 100% foolproof. ""there ways feed teach children"" 

that's easy say, alot difficult do. especially poorer communities. online schooling want gonna help kids computers? even access internet? 

&amp;#x200B;

and children get enough eat home still gonna get enough eat. cuz food. cuz nobody home go pick make them.  They’re saying Denver first district Colorado rule person classes, aren’t saying they’re first country. Everything else makes sense but... “least-religious state?” Relying quite assumptions there. US takes capitalism political practice instead economic theory. like Marx's Communist Manifest again, shit translate well real world. ones get right classroom door puke? kid tells told parent weren’t feeling well morning told, “I don’t time this/you’re fine/go nurse still feel sick later”. 

There doubt mind, covid positive kid sent classroom parent thinking “Let school deal it, things do”. people like post. people though (and still think) western = best. pure prejudice mostly scientific confirmation. best brightest live America.   ridiculous we're half way. feel like I've aged 20 years year. Cause people selfish, stupid ignorant. love pale comparison. Let even paler tomorrow. Love throw competition. Chicago probably 85% compliance, mainly mayor joking know it. 

The burbs wildly variable. ones like Buffalo Grove let someone store without mask, they'll yank business license Orland Park who's mayor actually advertised comply held 4th celebrations music festivals. One 4% positive one 21%. Guess which. C “So even though might actually make virus readily transmissible, appear impact we're vaccines. thank goodness that's case.”- Fauci culture also living elders well lives. fate eyes. Couldn’t tell ya Russian bot talking point. oh god sounds like awful hospital. post got closed.This particular hospital offer translators general Japanese cosmetic clinics arent accommodating foreigners. major surgery.  Holding death mill NY, fucking partisan hack. you, 12? Either truly don’t believe 32,000 people died NY, you’re really bad troll. really hope schools open year keep kids like occupied Reddit lol. heard voice too! ""I WANT QUIT GYM!"" Chandler Bing. Yep, think too. I'm Sacramento hospitals surrounding areas(1hr drive radius) plenty room hospitals. ER week ago kidney stone within 3hrs getting blood drawn, CT scan, diagnosis prescriptions. people dying would died getting point anyway considering healthcare's fault; right least. Seriously, post joke. infected people think would definitive answer already put research better use story sound like happened 50 years ago? Lol, say anything CCP, half-assed probably worst description one make it. would call U.S. government Chinese one ""half-assed""? moving belief he's incompetent selfish belief deliberately trying harm country Oxford vaccine USA already paid large number doses

300 million. deaths. 90% people show symptoms within 1 week. immediately end hospital still takes several days end dying.  past years I’ve REALLY lowered expectations people lmao wish didn’t find necessary hard understand pandemic, see people don’t standard air conditioning might flock beach &amp; tell they’ll stay apart others. don’t know things now, lived Barcelona (~10 yrs ago), apartment buildings could afford airco &amp; windows narrow/vertical wasn’t option window unit like U.S. “cold” water tap lukewarm brutal heat (so cold shower isn’t option), challenge stay cool. Hawaii. Oh yes man said two months ago wearing masks would little nothing curb spread stop people catching it. man reason mandatory masks peddled nationwide. Frauds fauci Everyone stays bundled entire day, simple. Zuckerberg add discussion? Might well Fauci interviewed potted plant. political. Democrat mayor=handled amazingly good news CEO runs company dumbed stocks. holds nothing company. seems like knows pass dumb ass Murica would explain degree comparatively large proportion younger health professionals doctors got severely ill died. agree 100%, need also give shout-out home state NJ well locking down. Thank god indoor dinging. serve tables Brooklyn comfortable yet. necessarily. course PX Tucson sprawling metros, there's plenty cities/towns clumped together thousands people living relatively close proximity other. folks travel neighboring communities often, hard super spreader infect lot people. siding cuomo way get trump's good side. U wise words. Deaths per capita care confirmed cases not.  Sadly, yes. live town 500 can't get air bnb save life. went store today, 6 state plates neither families getting ny cars wearing masks. think that's incredible assumption

The commenter said, ""*most* peoples lives"". ""Most people"" live poverty, hopefully, yes, probably hardest part peoples lives. And, trying diminish cruelty poverty one bit.....nobody live poverty. make great point.........there undoubtedly many many people find pandemic difficult part lives, life poverty hard anyway. never be. learn care far better have. Texas hospital information even public quick Google.  beer, anger. infected outside NY invade NY. game over.     like Walking Dead Last Us. would help spread faster. shame political now. Cuomo handled horribly. media sucking Democrat. sucks! infect anyone else knowledge? I'm sorry feel way. literally dont understand could think cares anyone himself. I’m talking government. Football players reason regular people can’t get tested. institutional failure failure capitalism/for-profit healthcare. capability everyone get tested. ""They correctly""...

Um yeah, let run rampant nursing homes elder care facilities ?  Yeah, ! agree, longer Trump speaks bigger hole gets. gotta postpone there's good vaccine! School postponed fall 2021 least. Yup. work home forced back office one else takes seriously. I’m anxiety meds keep panic attacks. things keep getting worse meds longer keep crying. Ugh. sucks. get know you
She goin' you

I’ll see common cold whole lot viruses. that's catch multiple times per year. vaccine distributed US September/October, would mean would available shortly distributed would take longer? Trump dropped ball, Cuomo dropped daily new cases, damn fool. got control trump claimed hoax. brain don’t believe that, you’re exactly what’s wrong discourse country.

Stadium sized projection. Try learn facts, dont respond do. timeline wrong? getting downvoted? believe Iranians counting deaths? Opens folder

Fumbles find *shocked pikachu face* meme Even mortality rate 2% would mean 500,000 deaths?

My guess ask sanctions eased hope number like help them. course does! alternative would blame incompetence, that's never going happen.  Didn’t guys king once? happened that? see also : frustrating, even liberal news sources pediatricians making claim children spread less. parroted family. Fuck man virus insane, always upsetting us. Fauci experts want contact tracing it. Politicians charge decisions like least listen experts say. live NYC. New York tackle virus perfectly correctly, lock completely reopened/are reopening correctly. states learned- lock open according science. Instead far virus everyone else hardly locked opened way soon. family Georgia terrified them.  inch closer election time get worse.  Im aware Florida still ain't sending young coronavirus patients nursing homes causing several thousand deaths.  ""news"". propaganda mixed facts. difficult part finding facts. New York model rest America New fucking Zealand coming man testing would raise number cases, putting blame entirely China, refusing wear mask now, rushing open country, etc....

this buffoon ran country right ground, i’m sad clearly doesn’t give fuck Americans. Looking 2020 nomination process, could argued looking multiple elections cookie cutter, interchangeable candidates ultimately change nothing name guy power.

I want change progress, want America become good decent country, understand far one zoom see candidates same. Except came Myrtle Beach made us hot spot... Low population density too. 

Only I'm aware CCP's tendency half ass lot stuff given long enough time frame. Seriously, wtf wrong reddit's Hive mind.   virus care money. Well never Or.... bare now.... jobs affected, one qualified bonus money, that, he's making less work. implies low hourly wage?

Where state EITHER us minimum wage? attractive many. think bigger attraction tight knit social circle implicit trust other. extreme us-vs-them community helps form fast tight bonds. superiority bit added perk makes easier believe. what's worse, drink kool-aid, almost always lose social contacts outside circle. ever doubt, *really* alone, scary enough make people double cognitive dissonance. Doesn’t politician also several dozen pending lawsuits well bunch botched surgeries? yeah, checked. NY highest number deaths long shot still. model guy things correctly, there's reason listen him. Thanks detailed reply. think delay reporting deaths creates unfortunate narrative. We’re reactive culture, we’re reacting 10+ day old events. Except see reality restaurants cheap food item buy dollar get around restriction. rule, absolutely pointless easy trivialize it. lot conspiracy theorists even understand GPS itself.

My dashcam GPS receiver log location I'm driving. GPS passive - satellites can't see you, they're like beacons blast signal loud enough everyone surface hear. dashcam picks signals saves SD card without ever transmitting anything back.

I still keep phone Airplane mode try prevent reporting cell towers, come on, stuff Wikipedia. understand enemy never win. Chill. wrong. happened. accept &amp; move on. Oh? fact still crime fact full shit.  Many countries operating ""fine"" system, locking specific situations (local contained outbreaks). recently lot houses area Berlin quarantined (people allowed leave) confirmed 40 new cases religious service.

You got wrong.

* China harsh quarantine measures.
* Many countries imposed fines
* China still produce, ship sell food stuff billion people. everyone home.
* could see exact images everywhere else world - empty streets, people going work staying inside, etc.
* South Korea implemented strict contact tracing strategy, still abrupt fall.

The thing that's different China many states, ruled dictator shuts people controls information flow. stupid think China country world would jump hundreds cases per day, none, week so, every aspect countries.

Think that: single foreign reporter working ""free"" news agency right China. Believing anything coming it, idiotic. company makes us responsible time management and, much business side accommodate, defining timelines. one project starts, pretty much locked in.

Our vacation policy ""at least 10 days year."" beyond that, we're free take much time want long still hit deadlines. We've people take entire months go back India Asia visit families nobody batted eyelash. left enough lead time plan around it.

It's honestly pretty great. often question. course seems frequent news, accounts seems like huge minority individuals. Statue pulling ok! everywhere subreddit, places. people like ""well, takes years make vaccine, they're rushing though phases"" like no, seem realize, reason take long time, go though phase, bc take awhile gather volunteers, approval trials whatnot, bc they're studying data years. terrifying, America world leader anymore. affected misled. worse us happy stood ground. mean probably end getting fired Friday night like everyone else fact stood ground Dr. Nix became window dressing photo shoots, me, kind shows committed helping people rather assuring future. would say soul even know trump going win  know of. time, spreading school badly anyway. remembers running room put dead? photos stacked coffins? initially fucked royally. came back it. huge crowds queens partying cause sick again. shit never end. Except, know, immunity gave nursing home executive. failed pretty miserably, really. impeachment removal, need senate house working good faith American people. Trump performed many impeachable acts, obvious senate convict, house try again.  Waiting end May clean subway...yeah, great job. DeBlasio still job even considered presidential candidate beyond me. Yes.

I seen parents family person months they're old prone illness. would able live went go see ended hospital weeks later, stay away.

What fuck kind question even that? pretty strait thinking expose elderly illnesses. Event flu seasons, people allowed visit nursing homes flu symptoms. Give break.... Socialism me, thee holla ya boi PCR tests rapid test? Teacher living paycheck paycheck, sadly that's option :( Yeah numbers similar everywhere right? Hahaha. seems almost implausible itself. Come guys nobody could predicted would happen. Totally unexpected. I'll take flu shot year. flopped country testing contact tracing. (Remember Google apple going contact tracing?)

But, yeah ppl wont wear masks long term social distance. Heck, deaths feel like cold. totally ignorant.

I suspect play countries great though. states getting hit hard inside AC. suspect thing move around temps drop...including countries. Time tell guess. hope people actually notice. Wait Doctor virus? thought tv character. live NY along Canadian border. somewhere around 8 active cases zero hospitalized. Every time go out, see vast majority people masks stores strictly enforcing them. grew parents extended family live there. unfortunate true. Rural upstate hardworking blue collar lot ""liberal educations indoctrinate people"" mentality. like identity opposed ""prissy educated liberal city folks"". way parts reddit facebook echo chamber ideas fit opinions, small towns even worse. ""facts"" come opinions people repeat like telephone game around town. certainly dont want fruity liberal doesnt agree everyone town. odds owns interest company release drug? people virus, people pay? maybe plans nationalize company drug? I'm trying think he's going profit this. California model, 30k people died NY! Interesting court system America rich. Two weeks ago UCSF Covid Grad Rounds one pediatrician annoyed scientific studies don’t decent age breakdowns allow anything concluded middle schoolers. studies say kids rather safe 0 9 age group risk 10 17. Detailed breakdowns year needed decide whether open middle schools. says impossible catch fake virus sent Bill Gates, fascinated debate. Great minds battling live Ohio can’t believe many people know lost minds. asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

And therein lies problem. Wait. voted sniveling, runny, weak piece shit scorned Bernie Bro? Fuck. You. voted Bernie didn’t get election didn’t turn bitter child vote worst candidate spite. 

There ‘tipping point’. helped elect man polar opposite Sanders blamed Hillary, like child would have. lot us didn’t like common sense know goddamn dumpster fire trump win would hold, fucking fun, it’s far exceeded dismal expectations. 

Where fuck emotional intelligence? cause people get severely ill compared people who’ve never dengue begin with, making sound like I’m antivaxxer absurd. worse naturally getting sick first time abject failure? properly tested large enough sample size found long released made standard immunization kids there. Pointing mildly different strains made people sicker doesn’t change fact made people sicker, fuck make anything half truth? also linked entire article it.

Your insistence defending bad medicine antivaxxers begin with, you’re literally ignoring negatives vaccine appropriately tested wide release. negatives something don’t cover pretend vaccines harm, fuels antivaxxer conspiracies. yes. employers provide it. employer subsidizes it, pay rest premium. 3 choices. ranged $2,000 year $4,000 year. significant expense. 

i sure hope get downvotes telling truth healthcare US, real fun... whatever cause, donny blows Definitely seems done well, though NY-NJ-CT coordinating everything together months. I'll look pre-collaboration timeline.  friday/saturday/sunday schedule cults shared places worship. hate baked in. Stitt fucking moron.   Half voters 2016. sold Russia, he's trying kill Americans, 4 10 still think he's good leader. America trash. Trump voters; people take action Trump less-rotten layer landfill.  Agreed. I’m waiting schools plan it’s 99% homeschooled me. fox news said Florida best. True, we'll like Asian cities. I'd fine that. assumed mask-wearing would stay Western culture now, least sick regular flu seasons, yeah. likely reelect him.

LOL. I'll wager whatever want put even odds trump wont get re-elected. kids part problem say.

Nobody ever asks kids care getting coronavirus.

""I kind low key want die"" said few. “But mr trump says ‘hokes’!” Cool, could please begin wearing masks indoor/crowded spaces cooler months permanently, plese? Everything Trump makes perfect sense assume goal infect many Americans possible. know exact situation guess could well-funded union backing up? I'd like see Quest Arizona clear 60k test backlog declaring improvement. even made slow ass progress's finally phase 4 city next week. know what's great economy? People feeling safe enough go spend everyone taking precautions! well documented women deal autoimmune issues men deal infectious disease. Yeah states really stuffed numbers. refusing acknowledge people die poverty. either monster really stupid. need stats back up. penny each? /s find it’s best continuously declare victory, eventually virus run victims. you’ve ever known real narcissist. thing basically. can’t apply logo reason illogical. Fine, Robert De Niro Leonardo DiCaprio back. That's worth couple hundred million easily. 

We'll hold onto Gulliani 😔 Really? so? giving playing president. knows getting grounded able play next 4 years, bother trying now. Well, wearing mask least could do. Literally least could do. It’s nice plan He’s walking metaphor whole thing.  make difference. people wear masks going swayed science reality. soon states started reopening caution thrown wind lot places. There’s lots YouTube evidence young invincible theme park vloggers wearing masks, even trying distance, influencing audiences same. 

If people platform can’t shamed following safety protocols, hope average Joe Mask? Lol also prob dont wear masks gov told to. Well got dupped, facial recognized. Let's take recent Beijing outbreak example. Looks like outbreak put week without new confirmed cases. Total number confirmed cases little 300.

Given Beijing like foreign media covering it. measures highly visible: 11 million people tested month, big chunk city war time closed managment peak, air road travel city nearly stopped duration outbreak, every confirmed case asymptomatic carrier isolated none ""home isolation"" nonsense.

Given this, seems quite believable me. international media made fuss numbers either.

Keep mind level restriction Beijing still quite drastic measures undertaken Wuhan.

In previous gig commerce China, importing stuff country. China perfectly capable making things high standard would want, price would longer fit ""China makes cheap nasty stuff"" stereotype, although would still cheaper comparative stuff made countries (if one available). cheap, low quality ""value engineered"" stuff indictive market segment targetting importers do, necessily China's capability. going back home one forgets mask 😑 find hard even joke pandemic amounts nothing less planned culling, genocide deemed economically nonviable. Heck, saw comment saying kids future/education important lives families. CDC means coronavirus. Problem solved. Lol. live western NY. matter whether like Cuomo not, basically everyone agrees he's handled Covid incredibly well. question ""do want bunker place 24 months?"" That's false dichotomy.

The question ""why fuck assholes want wear masks?"" can't bare goddamn minimum stop killing millions people? Cuomo Chip thing apparently OK’d far SLA concerned “today”, seems *substantial* food must 7/17, vague notion food choir actually talking made misdemeanor sex tell somebody HIV. I'd argue Hogan better. I'm actually happy he's handled Maryland pandemic. You’re describing view Florida, offense. Whatever going way could run mask on. change blood oxygen effect. think additional information may relevant here, question necessarily apply situation Vietnam way metric countries.

We reported local transmission cases since 16/4 gradually that, country opened step step people returned work school, wide scale testing required more. Atm commercial international flights arebstill suppressed community supposedly clean COVID, people rescue flights specialist delegations etc 100% tested quarantined 14 days. someone known illegally entered border, mostly workers returning Campuchea, standard contact-tracing quarantine/testing protocols would evoked. Apart that, test general population, test ratio surely go time (at least new hotspot flares flights resumed). stupidity tax...I like it. identify misinformation vs satire, parody, etc? money runs state comes state...we mainly tourist state. spent weekend Burlington assumed way people that. I’m shocked. felt like much bigger town Chicago suburb many people. agree. Ain't nobody going convince magic real. ICU RN here. Yup. Technically infection rate could high one died yet. happens bullets start flying. current protests look like tea party. People thought used measurements body parts. Good news Vermonty kiddies, school’s open fall!

Vermonty kiddies: *sigh* Now, know scientist here, experience younger people people caring crazy older farts giving damn. Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists. However risk ADE means phase one trials supposed demonstrate safety antibody response assess safety incompletely. able fully confirm safety alongside efficacy phase 3, trial members exposed virus. fact monkeys given vaccine didn’t die horribly exposed virus like happened one original SARS vaccine candidates reassuring... start something we'll start attending Maybe charge sensible. r/leopardsatemyface future self scared present self. That's crazy metro 2 million. live Vancouver similar population we've averaging 15-30 day last month. INB4 end literally place left doesn’t. don’t even social distance, it’s already like that. That's mind blowing me. year year study done double check hospital cleaning stats? would border remain closed viable vaccine? shithole Positivity rate 25% get real. Yea heard news US bought stock working vaccine yet sharing research rest world . fair? Every country steal research then. Surprise pikachu Thanks guys help yesterday. Update. grandfather getting admitted. Since private ward, allowed inside scared..

I need android app video calling. idea button home screen clicking button directly video call mother. Nothing else. Anything else confuse him. can't remember complicated steps. Please suggest app one touch Wiget anything would help me. help would appreciated Maybe ""Born US"" fitting you. I'm saying economic mobility great pretend is. people born one class die class.

Well, depends define ""best"", define best wealthy intelligent, deprive nations best people? make harder compete global economy US already dominates due years imperialism?

I could also argue borders inherently violent need get that. Yeah, well jokes them, I'm laid 3 days getting lot vaccines, especially flu vaccine. best friend RN covid hospital. know starting face serious fatigue depression. always upset people wear masks even coworkers refuse wear them. know yesterday actual covid patient telling believe virus real. insane doctors nurses deal with.  They're responsible failures. However, China's behavior towards countries criticize stupid. literally demanded praise countries governments, that's pathetic childish. Meanwhile downplaying flooding extreme weather saying internet 'wouldn't things positive?'. Yeah...... no.  pandemic easy control island, countries multiple borders countries hubs challenge whole another level. already said I'm vegetarian avoiding dairy products. chicken ice cream table

My dad vehemently peanut butter, made beliefs Everyone's aware situation Indian government ICMR. I'm sure they'll take press conference minute refute IMA's claim submitting ""world's best recovery rate"" BS I'm calling Walgreens road house asking nurse stick arm pull bike. 

I'm getting flu shot year, I'm 1 10,000 negative reaction it. negative reaction knocks ass full body muscle soreness nausea 3 days, want flu year. Mississippi Alabama still know of. anyone remember spotlight hailed possible next president begging Trump 3,000,0000 ventilators whatever lol..

 
He's politician.. easy makes look good, came time would save lives it.  


The media called Georgia ""human sacrifice"" pilloried Florida also. 


Can imagine Desantis done Cuomo rain death daily?  


The ""republican loves money wants people die"" narrative long assembled would absolutely lose minds. 


It's amazing narrative forced fit, rather lives economy civil liberties vs lives , security theatre , public demand get talked about.  


Nobody going democrats screw ups mainstream media. Barely track 150,000 170,00 deaths August 8th. Seems little slower expected, three weeks then. Vermont like 8 people tops Alabama get one day theres one left die... ""God helps help themselves""... Something like that. mean, like people Toronto attends game anyway. That's depression. seek help, although gut tells won't. remember, like everything else temporary, end. gonna hate human history unions illegal 

That absolutely insane, precisely reason need unions. I'm sorry deal do, teachers important people society comes raising next generation, certainly deserve treated way are. No, can't say agree. all. developed nations done this. trope applauded. bellicose, state country ""greatest"".
 
 Theres prize surviving virus. Life valuable one group another. Americans vast varied.

 people want eradicate mass scale, small skirmishes, people could called gardener's future. could great responders developers better tomorrows. Also raises question didnt implement facemasks start Oh man. Why, people, why. Bennington people backwards AF guess rest state well got ‘.........what?’ really. turns checks balances America basically gentleman's agreements actual teeth politicians acting bad faith. Even outside distancing?

I hope stop people start dying People wore masks without hear politician. ""Coronavirus Cleanup aisles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 everywhere else."" Great movie. much less likely transmitted outside, hence seen zero indication London protests led rise cases. Good news. France test, idea happends scale pandemic. Death per 100 000 US, hospital data. can't detect asymptomatic cases etc. 

We also test tourist excepts overseas place like Guadeloupe Martinique know french government joke buy tests kits US control people came outside islands.

On side spectrum US really accurate view pandemic massive testing. thing keep thinking someone get tested, actually contract COVID time they're wait result result negative tested week(or places) caught it.

Shits crazy. Psh easy survive covid two hearts regenerate. still shocked see ""minimum speed limit"" signs Florida. Ex's mom told sure ever driving slowly ""you might get shot"". Fuck Florida. know I'd want ""Top"" anything Russia. high unreliable windows.... never said young people disproportionately selfish old people. Maybe virus primarily killed young people rather old people like Spanish Flu, would seeing reverse trend. However, that’s case right fact remains virus far deadly old people, moms, dads, grandparents. also know young people continuing primary driving factor spread. 

I don’t care generational group statistically selfish. country crisis however unfair may be, falls everybody, especially least risk, make sacrifice modify behavior greater good. don’t want hear bullshit justifications young people propagating virus older generation somehow ones actually fault. National outlets appalled Texas, Georgia, Florida policies Oklahoma right them. Tulsa shut bit roll opening phases wonder Trump rally anything opening dates. Bynum great beginning republican stepped back line. Also, schools practiced social distancing, I.e avoided field trips, meeting schools etc.. think one. C. R. E. A. M. NY State deaths whole France, months warning. (Edit: third population).

They deal well, better US states maybe. poor 3rd grade school bus told one flu, come school ""studies important""
This literally month schools closed here


Same kid also used tell bus non chalantly mother used whip belt prior Corona . Really hope kid fine Ahh, ol' Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho maneuver taking credit brilliant idea letting experts brilliant ideas. exactly Republican wet dream? actual basis spewing hate like spew hate echo chambers like sub become (to honest reddit become really)?

I tend agree president horrible job start lean towards voting thing Democrats wheeled election, constantly reminded hate filled left Democrats general remember vowed never vote one life way acted treated people like since last election. Yeah, probably run know, stupid idiot brainwashed differently people thread. Right? Pretty sure 1 million cases 26k + dead means ""community spread"" going long time, starting... Thanks thoughtful response. I'm going go #7. Wearing masks DRAMATICALLY cuts transmission disease. need hard evidence know case. simply observe tens thousands people work healthcare exposed COVID patients get disease wear masks (and PPE). Granted, unfortunately, many HCWs gotten sick - small percentage them. 

If would wear masks, chill weeks, continue wear masks, going this. Meanwhile [Community Transmission Covid-19 Started India, Situation Bad: Indian Medical 

And Indian Government's [Thumping wonder average time get test results back state? I’m sure would increase 4th holiday weekend. fair, conspiracy nut, also brain tin foil hat: 

1. decision widely publicized back Jan. 
2. first one minted February.
3. Samoan fruit bat, ya know, American Samoan fruit bat. think really indicates anything, best knowledge really connection all. 
4. ever even 100% confirmed bats damn thing this? ""Oh, look weird thing Asians eat occasionally, must thing!"" millions Mexico American countries would considered low class. Many granted amnesty Reagan Clinton, many coming greatest socioeconomic backgrounds.

I see wrong wanting best immigrants. wrong, done math. I've walked basic math several different comments thread. Live VT every Trumper know pissed Phil Scott taking easy reopening quickly. damn good job opinion, done state well response. weird. time virus migrated China us, mutation. Wtf Amen amen, can't even see tribal are. purely political point.. 


LOOOOL people calling Desantis ""Deathsantis"" circlejerky low effort threads post, others hemming hawing Cuomo saying ""cut slack"" making every kind excuse. 


I'm amazed people think biased hypocritical get surprised MAGA types start rejecting authority altogether. 


They clearly adopted one tribal side yet get surprised people adopt other.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2 years people look back see plainly data, long election. people literally see want see nothing stop them, another guy pointed figures response someone wishing COVID implicitly. singing groups like, highly discouraged risky behavior? don’t know shit fuck. also lot people reject hepatitis treatments. I've talked 3 people told thing, would rather die disease go medications. Cases world except US &amp; Brazil tiny number per capita. immunity _starts_ wane around 3 months follows somewhat normal distribution, potential pool reinfection could low 2-3% confirmed cases end march -- words, 150-250K.

It's simply soon statistically determine handful apparent re-infections significant. Read /r/gainit

You need put caloric surplus. Try eat much sugar bombs even adding couple oily fried chicken, ice cream shakes, peanut butter toasts, scooped avocados make quite dent. . That's it. go create excel something eat start munching. Literally anything better deficit young. Like said - time working regret it. excuses. Also might allow visual inspections blood? stop social gathering? people stopped giving shit Horses courses. Oh guy basically said sympathy generation, authored crime bills got us here, said would veto getting healthcare? 


 
They're hitting balls hammer. Trump bit fashy, thats it. Getting kids school one thing, there’s reason playing football. One hopes flattening real due shortage testing reagents. That's silly argument. Yes, quite frankly. I’m expert, very, much afraid virus, I’ve following vaccine progression research pretty closely. Here’s far:

- leading candidate, seemingly far, Oxford University vaccine. Originally developed MERS back 2013 (I believe, might wrong year there), Oxford vaccine went phase 1 trials previous years, platform already proven safe. Based chimpanzee adenovirus (adenoviruses cause common colds humans), it’s genetically engineered express spike protein SARS-CoV-2, shared roughly 50-70% similarity MERS spike protein. one well phase 3 trials; began back late May/early June memory serves, remember seeing someone /r/COVID19 saying they’d results tomorrow (Monday, June 19th). might misremembering they’d release results that, however, take grain salt.

- CanSino (or Sinovac) vaccine probably next up. Developed Canadian/Chinese biotech firm. It’s based inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. admittedly don’t know much one; evidently they’re phase 2/phase 3 testing believe it’s approved use PLA (China’s military).

- Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech created vaccine based mRNA platform. don’t really understand science work, something viral RNA. Moderna’s caused big stir US back February/March, able come prototype based solely released genome virus. began phase one trials March/April, finished phase 2 trials last month (I think, again, don’t quote that). They’re currently working 30k person phase 3 trial US (which volunteered for, sure I’ll part it). Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine one two they’ve gotten FDA fast track status for, may ultimately beat Moderna market, know even less theirs, they’re working phase 2/phase 3 trial right now.

There’s whole host others still earlier development, four real big ones, understanding. right now, like mentioned, Oxford vaccine seems closest ready population; they’ve partnered AstraZeneca, who’s agreed manufacture cost gotten 100 million dose order UK 400 million dose order US, may available Q4 2020-Q1 2021. 

That’s think of. Understandably, lot people hesitant vaccine pushed quickly, result happened H1N1 back 2009, I’m pretty much set personal risk virus would much worrying risk vaccine. Hopefully, Oxford vaccine pan out, since that’s one personally trust readily available soonest. Trump doesnt want ruin election  Lots India fake credentials, wouldn’t surprised idea do. :( Well never really thought planned out, ego plays padding pockets. starting look like playbook turning country Snow Crash.

Leverage pandemic destroy civil projects protections block powerful commercial interests establishing dominant unassailable territories. 

Most world's top powers countries - would look like established sovereign soils? rights would citizens able claim, freedoms? 

That's road goes.... let's make turn get please. No. big cities too. them, aware. 30.4 percent positive today. public gatherings limited even banned, people expect would happen? telling high risk 75 year old yesterday people need careful. mentioned ""the heat kill it"" look states bad right now. said lockdowns spread it.  said numbers fake. love new Hampshire.

Best state country. I’m disagreeing excess deaths figures need explaining too.  Couple things here. First, news report antibodies last based questionable research, second, antibodies type immunity. coronaviruses studied, SARS1 MERS antibodies lasted two years, would bit surprising (but impossible) SARS2-COVID antibodies lasts months. research bit mixed, seen three papers suggesting antibodies last two suggested do, Wuhan study (saying antibodies fade quickly) poor methodology - based estimated cases actually follow people swabbed positive. three smallish sample sizes. inclined trust New York study nearly 20,000 participants good methodology, found 90% antibody prevelance 3 months follow up, line know coronaviruses. /r/Coronavirus/comments/ht0gtb/sarscov2_infection_induces_robust_neutralizing/

And detectable antibodies mean immunity. already evidence regarding cells, see ""Robust cell immunity convalescent individuals asymptomatic mild addition, body register virus memory cells, even circulating antibodies, body still quickly produce demand (upon re-exposure virus). thing happen Covid, believe studies yet last checked research animals still good levels antibodies immune re-infection attempts. See That's clear. results date vitro may translate. drug question thought potential treatment, cure. ketosis, still glucose metabolism happening (your body still produces glucose via gluconeogenesis blood glucose 60-100 mg/dL range). Many cells require glucose lack mechanism use ketone bodies fuel. 

So (IMO) metabolism sufficiently complex think say keto diet cure. said that, I'm staying keto diet anyway. Nearly 2 million active cases.  People dying streets due lack treatment facilities. Chinese agents got help needed directly white house.  140k, great, terrible.

Edit: lol getting downvoted this? Guess /s really make diference. Yes sarcastic Trump said back 60k numbers would pretty good. many cases across globe, sounds like topic needs get focus. Definitely isn’t 13 OTOH, people refuse vaccines bIlL gAtEs ... looking excuse, article provide it. Bottom line: Indoors bad, outdoors good. want inside anywhere house without either everyone masked 100% mean bandana nose, wearing N95. place think safely unmasked indoors class 100 cleanroom standing front vent hood. shortcuts, folks. airborne person 6 feet away mask nose source infection. true people seem react based emotional impact situation. School shootings, terrorist attacks, scary. disease takes weeks kill you, meh. nearly scared pandemic be. fantastic article. shame post didnt get visibility!  hope right, personal reasons. could stand see assholes take solid hit covid. frontline include beyond healthcare? know lockdowns, anti-lockdown protests protests sure spread virus. ignorant life much worse chances dying much higher covid. Oh god voice reason thank you. None people work hospitals

Also imagine bunch nudist home patients field hospital cots? Everyone’s gonna fall everyone’s skin gonna break down. they’ll “safe” right 🙄 RemindMe! 2 Months “is available yet?” Sounds like paradise. “If pretend went away maybe get confused stop spreading” bullshit? Fatality rate relatively lower compared rest world. 
Recovery rate good sign sense medical team getting things sorted well. Hold bad “press” accountable: Alison Steinbach shit person truly one biggest scandals I’ve ever witnessed. would bet real number less half. media politicians running without slightest bit scrutiny suppress us using justify draconian bullshit wasting small time planet Earth. Literally schools dummies wealth. We're really sure recovery looks like, especially lots people demonstrating post-Covid symptoms, implies recovery necessarily mean woods yet long-term effects may play.

I wonder governments going even able account post-Covid deaths. Unlikely 14 days, check CDC current guidelines person longer considered infectious. lot places restricted eliminated recovery testing conserve supply. Fingers crossed region.  explained person east coast idea we'd ask speed limit 85 ever.

I said ""Have ever gone 4 hours 75 without seeing town bigger 500 people? try old federally mandated 55 mph.""

Not long ago Nevada Utah gas/service stations/towns/rest areas/etc 200 miles. way Las Vegas, obviously popular tourist spot. put ton warning signs prevent people running gas.

I've gone road trips see single car 100 miles before. sort thing happen Vermont - especially since entire length state grand total 160 miles. Cuomo ask things way field hospitals operate doing. stringent guidelines get Javitz center instance...I nurse NYC, patients go javitz center, first go hospital criteria transferred impossibly long one qualified. Comfort operates similarly stringent guidelines. Also putting bunch old people field hospital cots huge fucking risk skin breakdown falls (beds alarmed). Military healthcare trained deal young healthy people getting sick injured, demented grandma Tilly gets bed every 2 minutes forgetting she’s amputee. actually went looking updated prediction 134k august.

Range 95k Nah idts, virus taken mask what’s going 40 years America. American “dream” dead while. Source?  good?  What? wrong? denial what? never understood people pretend right feel right. Like, what's point? statistics clearly show less 50% Reddit traffic US - that's objective fact, 'right' 'wrong'. point? queue? Irvine's fine, probably lot Asian people here. nuts think Irvine's culture anything like Huntington Beach lol. Seems like another testing bottleneck people waiting week results, others symptoms wait week even get tested. weeks ago CDC said estimate 1 10 infections diagnosed. stage, true infection number must charts Japan, South Korea, volunteered Ebola crisis Monrovia, mexico, Brazil, us  reply show assumption batch testing wrong. good clinic normally disinfect between, hard get infected via surface need transfer virus mouth nose, relatively ACE2 receptors. inhaled virus, much riskier, far likely find ACE2 receptor bind to, huge number lungs. virus cannot enter human cells without ACE2 receptor. Therefore current research suggest vast majority infections happen breathing people's droplets, (if any) occur touching surfaces touching face. right cases confirmed occured surface transmission. 

Also see /r/Coronavirus/comments/hltqck/exaggerated_risk_of_transmission_of_covid19_by/ "" Yeah, like yesterday.   Javitz center also bureaucratic disaster. nurse NYC attest fact even transferring patient fit stringent criteria impossible. really big deal wrong, are. Enjoy day. Holy shit , googled rent 1bd 2bd California. Wtf?? You’re wrong, hospitals area started running PCR nasal swabs 30 minutes. decades humans alive, virus infecting us months. data INCREDIBLY insufficient moment assume anything.  also 10s 100s thousands cruisers either stuck sailboats separated boats. Travel restrictions maritime border closures made life difficult. Boats need safe passage crews need travel boats. Like Trump know obscuring data like definitely kind UN level human rights violation? Like win lose 2020 presidency protect forever he's spent last four years pissing off. Like even UN, think US different president, regardless party probably also hate Trump?

Adams Fauci originally saying masks needed buy back March probably biggest impact US.

If rationale shortage masks, surely could suggested homemade masks protection. must previous evidence back use homemade masks, many people pictures 1918 seem cloth masks. Jazz hands. Important note US friends: want keep masks even numbers mask mandates become outlawed numbers go up. Evil empires think alike. did.

Agreed though people go emergency room true emergency call ambulance... aka call ahead... #CRIMINAL#

Not acknowledging/being mindful facts thereby causing deaths, CRIMINAL OFFENCE. did.  states New York, Florida, Texas California one country, would third worst infections (after rest US Brazil). TL;DR idea. could make better, could make worse. slowing long that. Hehe quite mouth breathers. someone whos lived half life Asia half America, i've felt ""weather news"" quite occasions, walks American life. would imply scientific evidence not, not, sufficient support assertion ""face masks matter"".

Because otherwise fact body evidence growing would matter. Trump literally movie villain, he's basis Biff back future 2. Interesting. bring grandmother ER mini stroke last month. main hospital Burlington, VT cannot enter ER. assessed tested outside permitted building. bring 1 person cannot answer questions yourself. one person isnt allowed anywhere hospital except waiting room. Kind shocked SOP right hospitals. Would enough public actually get vaccinated though even things true?  Sounds like it’s good time make ex girlfriend. proven idiot asshole, shouldn’t settle either. feel guilty, that’s you. Stop feeling guilty rightfully calling sick. It’s morally wrong expose others illness, feel way guilty going in. Iran could literally ship 1,000,000 Chinese people day would decrease positivity rate dramatically lol. America verifiably dangerous CoVID-19 seeding country point time, China negligible. sure think one political party really anti-science other. Seeing anti-vaxxers tendency Democrat party, seems party imply pro-science, disappointing would rather imply one party always wrong this.

While may first time CDC's advice match scientific literature (I actually know true not), certainly first time US government organization match scientific literature, last either. best let government choose best everyone.

The children died China wearing standard surgical style mask, much easier breath N95s possible issues could come makeshift mask.

While supporter UBI economic reasons externalities caused automation along horrible market distortions caused social welfare programs simply give people money able spend way see best fit personal needs, actually think real reason children need able go school personal development. Again, looking pediatricians types people make assessments health risks children vs needs proper development lot reasonable people focus virus vacuum.

You make argument government power choose dictate actions everyone sake everyone, like China contained outbreak. again, that, also choosing houses flood ones rainy season. Spoiler alert, choosing flood poorer areas produce many things worth wealthier areas.  less broke, thanks asshole That's good hear. Hopefully we'll vaccine sooner later.

The nurse doesn’t like me. Tell get n95 better protects well too, even basic masks protect wearer least little bit. learned damn lessons. South will, too, bodycount rises high enough. Shame, necessary evil country full idiots. Brazil full antivaxxers. They're going end better US. surprise considering videos watched today people gathering ignoring virus 4th July. Sadly numbers go next couple weeks. sorry, thats GOP, “elected officials“ soviet russia kill covid-19  Called it. Common sense really. - testing every day doesn;t safeguard one. Sounds good though think would also depend President. Yea game chicken, would bet Japan afraid China believing accept disadvantage.  Vibe tried, failed DC ordered bayonets.

The armies much indoctrinated Constitutionalism. 

Thats turned arming DOJ controlled guards  HOLY SHIT, 17 allowed absences?! high school allowed 5! Given ridiculous concept electoral college, vote basically irrelevant live safe state (ex. Alabama). Remember, Trump lost popular vote. I'm updating future references Gov. CoRona Deathsentence seeing that.  son going last semester student teaching. I'm terrified. Bill gates even said coronavirus spread talking breathing. Perhaps loudmouth, uneducated ""me im right shut listen me"" culture coming back bite us. watched show sex education could believe it, heard US really strange (and dangerous) things thought young people.


I even googled it, thought that’s bad propaganda. behold, really people teach kids stay abstinent marriage don’t know use condom, pill,...or contraceptive except „coitus interruptus“. 


That’s dangerous....we sex Ed 13 14, that’s curriculum age. Sure, giggled embarrassing, least knew to. one person know got pregnant finishing school said, fault. knew use contraceptives, it. stepped responsibility. Yes, summer vacation started attended school. confirm, outbreak onboard ship. PUI showed symptoms 4-5 days getting onboard. isolated sent via crew boat. 5-6 days later two individuals developed symptoms, job called boat headed port. Entire crew tested (49 total) 4 additional people tested positive either asymptomatic presymptomatic. CDCs estimated R value fits spread T. crew removed minus legal minimum manning crew. boat professionally decontaminated stay I’m currently ships chief engineer, thankfully tested negative taking another test get home. would also like bring attention fact 200 Mexican offshore oil gas workers died due Covid 19.

I’d also like add mind blowing watching people claiming virus hoax, virus isn’t bad, numbers inflated, whatever wild conspiracy, ones freaking confirmed case. time working offshore never seen sickness (less cruise ships) spread quickly. second two cases needed oxygen taken boat. ever consider might totally wrong people like actual problem? should. 

At certain point one must choose idiot asshole. 2 possibilities. really must assume over. Another death 8 days deaths. active case increased 30 2 weeks? makes great political ad every democratic candidate running office America really pisses health authorities lots countries discouraged mask wearing beginning. understand concern running PPE, created additional level distrust public. Canada, beginning line ‘there’s indication masks shutting borders affect spread virus. I'm picturing Noble Team Halo comprised Cher. anyone who’s read article: aim lock aggressively test _regions_ U.K. start experience local outbreaks (Leicester first example this). National lockdown would (in theory) necessary things got control across whole country again.

IF test trace people well enough pull actually one sensible things Johnson backed, heard huge range things effectiveness U.K. contact tracing system keeping fingers crossed getting hopes high yet. Correct. Many live one state work another example. Hospitals use masks outlet valves. Kinda defeats purpose right now.

Also, silicone instead fabric, make firm fitting less material still comfortable.  end justify means means less deaths. power invisible enemy. People don’t care, even though scariest all. Bruh lived lives year would ok.

Nobody clue works saying that. get disaster far worse saw, deaths millions war Ba Sing Se. DeSantis stated kids old enough go school.

“My kids aren’t school-age yet,” DeSantis said. “I got 3-year-old daughter, 2-year-old son, newborn daughter. tell school-age, would zero concern sending them.” basing on? expert opinion? Please share data us. Yeah there's risk getting trampled. fact stopped explain HS means, instead throwing weird acronyms place expecting everyone else understand, made respect american. take Atorvastatin well. least 10 years. wonder could switch? remember going several types would develop joint pain. know try Tricor. say I'll put bounty strategy soften blow that’s happening since crisis began. “We’ll see 2 weeks” “We’ll see 2 months” people plan endure crises short periods time can’t cope “plan stay indoors 18 months.”

Also model place worst second worst (NY NJ) mortality rates planet used obviously didn’t work think density means much.

It outbreak mostly hitting outer suburbs far less dense.

That's point.

Density matters, we're STILL insane hotspots dense. That’s true! They’ll go great lengths save fetuses!  Stage 2 extremely successful. read 100% test subjects administered vaccine achieved high levels antibodies. China's already administering vaccine military personnel deployed overseas projects.

They're hiding mansions touching little girls part, agree. closely follow Trump says, can't certain, believe Trump damaging society many people think. think he's pretty neutral Corona, advocating things like mask usage, using one himself, advocating everyone wear mask. think could taking role everyone's sake. Personally, follow regulations area/any stores, choose wear mask I'm risk, deal risk people. But, especially areas recommended, people wearing masks directed least. definitely think Trump take stance say, ""listen local gov."" also understand ""make mind"" mindset, allows everyone make choices. think, situation, actively wrong. helpful/effective could be.  Same. 

Blue city, surrounded MAGA counties. less vectors then? ['They = worst deaths per capita country far. FOUR TIMES HIGHER national average. rest country ""correct"" NY, we'd half million deaths.

[Cuomo sent thousands infected old people nursing homes spread COVID like wildfire massively increased It’s time Canadian Baseball League... bigger diamonds return Expo’s! Proud you. I’ve wondered thing. Big guy always get checked every year. Sugar normal blood pressure little high nothing outrageous. Still got ways go me. Dr Ashley Bloomfield.

Any American examples? US could seal island, think might done right, too. 

Sadly, really kind advantage anywhere. Hawaii, maybe, Hawaii handled well, probably coincidentally.

Don't get wrong: like NZ handled things, much, especially transparent public, dealt much better starting position than, example, NYC. No, serious. bragging it.

Even quote evidence clearly suggests rampant manipulations interventions, serious (yet hidden) we're seeing open week.  see front page. Fully paywalled site 👎🏽 I'm aware Puerto Rico, though state, I've work vacation...beautiful place. One additional language equal EU situation, point still stands.

If modify statement “all trump supporting republicans” I’d full agree though. 
The swift drama free death would enormous wonders bringing country back respectable level world stage current joke rest globe. started observation older people arent taking precautions. least NYC, that's impression. Poll says anything likely wear masks.

Some else commented average age retail worker 39yrs old, isnt young. years national average workers, theres gap average age new cases (saw 33yrs florida). obviously lot industries/services stayed adults, classified Centers Disease Control Prevention, likely younger adults say worn mask time past month: 74% ages 65 older say done this, compared 66% ages 50 64 six-in-ten 30 49 (61%) 18 29 Yikes do? guys put man moon 60's... unbelievable. sad USA become. always wanted visit USA make roadtrip east west. im sure. need guys world police instead china russia. need get shit together.

Please do, please adjust population density massive influx travelers NYC forced start with. Agreed, see riots now, imagine conspiracy hold vaccine distribution? would get ugly quickly! F w/o mask mandate? Bender 2020: meatbags chance. point backtracked stance followers head would explode exact reason quoted comment, I’m sure relevant sub. think Fauci saying, good model state manage reopening adjust changing conditions. think anyone US good job initial crush, though. Stockholm maybe certainly across country. 

With said ""half immunity"" helps _a lot_ since make much milder measures. example, Sweden still working home possible. bunch morons still vote including one early 40s underlying conditions

I'm 47 (was 46 caught it).. also underlying/pre-existing conditions. literally best straight kill me. Hospital 38 days (16 days ICU Ventilator). insane. many stories. ICU Delirium nightmares (for 16 days). learn walk (actually took 12 days). Heart racing one night give 6mg Adenosine stop heart allow restart correctly. Man,. battle every day. 

I still feel weird calling ""survivor"". know earned it.. I'm also lucky.  Go live streets, shit worth paper printed Like fucking idea money would spent, dumbass. That's American photo I've ever seen... drive water? Moreover, first coronvirus stimulus package, [CARES cost $2.2 trillion. $25 billion represents 1% that. still shitload money, [more NASA's annual we're **going** spend trillions dollars fighting recovering Covid-19. Testing critical slowing down. 

Cutting 1% budget slow testing going cost thousands lives trillions dollars recovery. inhumane also bad business.  make clearer. sufficient enough increase account 300 cases regular case load across rest country. 

Yes, saying Wuhan mass testing certain baseline...and Wuhan testing large drop (75% so) number asymptomatic cases across country... 

Before 100s, 50s, 20s, 10s. think witnessed something called downtrend. Complicated, Wuhan testing finished, asymptomatic cases rest country doubled previous low.  perfect lockstep? That's amazing.

They double. single digits outbreak Beijing. realize data includes entire country, aware still beginning. 

I aware talking beginning. used beginning example asymptomatic cases could excluded. 

Would like take back point tracing means blanket tests people location. 

Most countries contact tracing. countries contact tracing good need showing symptoms get tested long many places. 

This true China since beginning, yet still found 300 asymptomatic cases Wuhan. doubt countries would able even capable finding 300 asymptomatic cases.

There needs contact tracing, followed mass testing close contacts. Emphasis mass testing. illusion countries well? select few, see still stuck February? Maybe March? 

Says guy that's trouble dynamic numbers based old data. brother law still proudly parading himself, sister, 3 kids around Ocala mask-less. Something something freedom. Something something liberals. Nobody said stops catching virus. absolutely know whether would caught mask, caught it. Speculating sounds really stupid. mention better methods going bring up. Mostly anti-mask supporters New Jersey also did. said since day one damn, Fauci taking kiddie gloves these... well kiddies. feel like I'm living parallel universe somethin Couple things 1) outcomes better done. Medical experience, remdesivir also used believe.

2) Delay. looking numbers repeatedly seems there's 3 week lag case confirmed reported death. we're seeing deaths mid/late june numbers 55-60%. we're 1000 deaths day now, go 1600 day roughly there's chances daily case count (which still going up).

3) NYC missed lot cases. really high % positives per test before, showing missed lot confirmed cases. Realistically total number cases something like double now. Florida lower %, nothing stop spread. NYC worked stop spread flatten curve.

4) Florida's risk populations seem mostly protect far. extent spread probably continue true.

Basically, Florida make changes, there's good chance reach NY levels death. seem anything stop they're taking measure slow things down. go 20k+ cases day see 250-300 dead day, get vulnerable populations could go even higher.

I really hope lockdown admit wrong. Would save lives. Oh yeah, plenty reactions. long term affects worse. took market lawsuits. model everyone avoided mass death used. care Cuomo. 

I'm telling NY strategy Italy/Europe strategy Wuhan/South Korea strategy. places contained it. 

Florida South actively that. claiming ""Magically going fine.""

It's not. I'm sorry all.  That's old news. recent studies shown protect you. fully, better wearing one. shocked point equates close flat IQ (imbecile).  
This disease sadly make dumber.   Vermont majority white, educated, middle class, liberal, irreligious, state. know even worst pandemic NYC, areas Manhattan lower cases country? Imagine entire state people populate West Village Tribeca density Iowa. 

It’s way easier stay safe population tracks every metric already says they’re going healthy smart. 

Meanwhile majority cases states led majority low education, black Latino, low income service workers still go church every week largely deny science don’t get message language/cultural barriers. also live multi generational households. 

It’s harder keep safe don’t know science work fast food restaurant. 

For example Latinos make ~15% San Francisco account 50% cases. Whites Asians 60% city make ~30% cases. It’s almost exactly opposite. safest people around city rich, white Asian tech workers. There'll happy ending, represent reality. History written control. would Satan do?

He would enlighten people. Lucifer literally means ""light-bringer"". Christianity, hand, considers knowledge sinful. current administration Christian thing, Fauci devil's work.

Delicious irony. panhandle Florida them. There's one Milton, FL right near Pensacola. 

I think there's still Piggly Wiggly around well. One big hopes COVID stops thing. Hopefully we’ve learnt lessons   fucking minor US History consider quite learned history never heard Tulsa Massacre saw excellent Watchmen tv series HBO. highly annoyed this. Apparently really taught regularly Oklahoma Black History college courses nationwide. Camps immigrant kids went evil, people chose ignore put cages: True, I'm extremely stressed well change, least I'm able comprehend changes happening. Imagine even able that. Poor kids :( France says hi. Nobody thought would work. look, freed ICU beds normal hospital beds. piling corpses hospital morgue either. Yum? That's lot 9/11s  wish could say AZ, we’re hot mess Thanks Florida man! Love france banned Niqab security threat know person looks like, time changed. guess terrorists bad guys work pandemics.  GA lot offer... Granted there's plenty crazy people here... Including governor 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Kiddo? probably age son ;) really bugs Fauci gets pass this.  I’ve driven past Vermont. I’m move there.  incorrect. CDC wanted enact mask mandate mid-March, White House said No. nowhere article, actually read it, claim mutation makes deadly. actually say may even reverse. talking general, transmissible mean virus lethal - fact opposite often true. There's evidence coronavirus mutated make patients less sick. yet, supporters Trump administration... realize literally linked oped. Sourced opinion. repeating well known fact
 keep going opinion link. Shocker!!! I’m wondering long trump comes it. He’d probably say gets Covid-19 better anyone believe me. wrong

&amp;#x200B;

I usual idiot... try follow me.. go ahead think may different case, holes filter inserts.

Not CA, guidelines place may one-way valves many non-medical masks have. image linked one-way valve. valves make breathing easier, exhaled air passed valve filter material.

The purpose mask protect wearer, also (and main purpose) protect people catching virus wearer filtering air wearer breathes out. Evidence suggests mask actually much effective second purpose. 

This also partly it’s important people community wear mask lower transmission rates, also partly wearing masks aren’t N95 certified, isn’t alternative N95-equivalent mask, still relatively effective.

With valves, masks easier breath won’t filter air wearer exhales don’t suit second purpose, i.e. protect others wearer. look clinical situations operating theatres, masks doctors nurses wear won’t types valves, they’ll expel unfiltered possibly contaminated air otherwise sterile condition.

Although there’s much evidence around surrounding coronavirus, valves may make chance people catching coronavirus higher, hence they’re discouraged banned.

It’s different mask OP linked, holes aren’t one-way valves, actually contain filter material, rest mask silicone, exhaled air filtered like medical-purpose masks. Right wing media sheep care. Foxnews watched ""news"" station country. numbers game snarky fks numbers. choose stay home, die. 

Don't get wrong, masks, simply stating people get sick mask 100% asked it. system way everybody pays. hospitals stay business 1/4 people pay.

We could turn away immigrants poor, we've chosen to. fact pay means should, people less fortunate still get health care.

You convince people overcharged things ER. one, go ER bandaid. #2, refuse it.

I went ER antibiotic resistance bacterial infection turned foot purple 3 weeks hurt like hell. gave IV antibiotic get ER shitty insurance, cost $1000. short nap 45 minute IV, could walk lot less pain. crap, least needed it.   Trumps wants chaos anarchy. wants implement state emergency, leading police state followed dictatorship. Make skin color options like creep people out. r/LeopardsAteMyFace Sorry, what? couple months ago. even ""serology studies"" USA.

you guys amateurs... nothing thats steal technology I'm confused, eating fruits &amp; vegetables actually increase chance dying covid stronger immune system cytokine storm me? Someone still call ahead buy one classroom? I'm glad I'm CA. worse lately, least governor takes seriously. I'm glad I'm one states still catering ""free-dumb"". story topper, Vietnam gone 4.5 billion years without Covid death. Back April, thought Cuomo total failure governor leader New Yorkers acting late.....

Right now, guess worst. US CDC well organizations (such WHO) say Vietnam's statistics accurate. Try living middle it, maddening. question sanity every day.

Most important, — students teacher — safe.

If I’m asked return classroom pandemic rages, walk away. deeply love teaching, risk spreading virus way could hurt child family member child. children make small proportion U.S. coronavirus cases less likely become seriously ill adults, virus might linked “multisystem inflammatory syndrome children.” Plus, many students struggle poverty multigenerational households. risk passing virus might pass vulnerable loved ones. won’t it.

It isn’t fair ask teachers buy school supplies; aren’t government. anyway. isn’t fair ask us stop bullet; aren’t soldiers. go work every day knowing there’s school shooting, we’ll die protecting students.

But draw line: isn’t fair ask part massive, unnecessary science experiment. human research subject. it.

Rebecca Martinson teacher Northwest Career &amp; Technical Academy Mount Vernon, Wash. lol fuck whoever wrote article. Hospitalizations full admit new patients, moron. cases occurring Vermont right now? 56 people live Vermont. Well, deal wrapping piece cloth around exhale valve. P100 exhale filtration efficiency, cloth masks. wrong sub buddy. think searched one r/conspiracy

Stay safe even elected first time around even remote possibility? VPs vetted scricter grounds him, fuck get through??  real joke said anything defend necessity school meals truancy laws. I'm funny, are. took shot people shifting concerns can't defend own. go ad hominem me. Cool. Good luck that. I’m NJ anxiety roof time. NYC worse considering concentrated numbers. part everyone taking seriously. company shut lockdown someone came sick uncontrollably coughing. weren’t enough supplies supply chain actually sanitize office. many governors positive? Oh sound alarm finally affects surging constituency, threatening power?

The ideal called selfishness. 4 greed, cruelty, corruption, deception. ya don’t get vaccine govt takes 200 paycheck every week I’m fucking funding ignorance. know god damn well people don’t get going ones running hospital bills aren’t going pay! that’s it! TLDR version? 2nd highest. NJ higher. Yea, is, say it... live here. Especially 60000 tests backlog ICU's full. flying blind. fear.

*slams monster energy drink, sends dirt bike sweet jump, crashes, spinal job, puts monster energy sticker wheel chair* Hell, even really read headline, skipped right comments. didnt say specifics thought got 2nd time. know? said, either lying complete moron. Every parent ton planet worried kids. aren’t even school age. They’re like 4 under. So, say wants he’d put kids school. means nothing aren’t going school anyway. would work area frigid winters? Normal, tipo de coisa que cérebro normal se recusa acreditar que é verdade... government *is* [comprised of] people.

Companies *are* [comprised of] people.

The entire government people, documents, buildings. Everything else heads. Confirmed [Governor DeSantis Davy would like join immortal slave crew. Yes, state forced people virus nursing homes beacon . . . Yes, hard. locked efficient staying in. don’t trust China, first report cases fatalities first “curve” implemented masking contact tracing.

Their curve large mimicked countries took similar measures, based don’t see reason doubt them. know anywhere anyone would willing able that?

Contact state government -- use state's Rainy Day Fund purpose. Depending source check fund like $8BB $10BB it, that's good fit. 

And would let whole state keep schools closed, maintain best thing (if good thing) Gov. Abbott done whole mess -- close schools &amp; keep em closed first read ""in-prison teaching"" still made sense. please make people go checkout covid wards. choose wear mask not. comes bunch grown ass adults petulant children:

""Don't tell try I'm gonna opposite spite. Fuck you""

#america Change likely caused massive BLM protests people marching mostly younger generations. What’s hospitalization rate 20s bucko? .002%? Well least got deserved. unfortunately doubt stop :( makes sad think people would knowingly destroy peoples' lives name profit. I'm surprised, still sad nonetheless.  set rainwater harvesting store cisterns? grid homes NM get 7-9"" rain year. even less rainfall AZ? interesting diagnosed Covid-19 die anything, death listed Covid-19 death regardless amount time passes.

This interesting odds dying C-19 given age actuary table odds dying given year means would throw numbers considerably.  SLTrib Utah paper  Young people roughly statistical chance GETTING virus. chance severe effects getting it. 

That said, many long terms side effects virus reported even young people little long term studies conducted young person taking chance total moron. considering fact easily get loved ones people seriously ill. 

People stupid.  literally didn’t, places 60-70% people antibodies means virus burned basically entire population petered out. 

The lockdown measures didn’t stop virus, basically everyone could get get least temporary immunity. love clappy comments. Thank you. don’t know what’s going happen. fewer deaths

Pick one. Takes months GOP Senate let again, guaranteed. É, esqueço sempre disso. Obrigado por lembrar! “No R E state bailouts.”

-FTFY, Mitch. America? There's really number high enough. Unless happens family member, matter people. 

They'd start stacking bodies like cordwood streets people notice / give shit. may track though entertainment. ""Look loser!"" add, family members
 Especially Jr. Came type something similar-

Teachers tested daily! JAN. 11

China reported first death.
On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported first known death illness caused virus, infected dozens people. 61-year-old man died regular customer market Wuhan. report death came one China’s biggest holidays, hundreds millions people travel across country. Gotta get state federal funding  agree. Like said lot cities still flailing back then. point say see Seattle anything different LA NY Chicago time, I'm sure different response, biggest employers preemptively sending workers home long state mandated it, maybe. 

(Those cities saw March.) ready apply Oxford commas. could that, CHILDREN !!!! went grab pizza Domino's today. sitting parking lot, see African American employee wearing face-mask white store owner walked around without one. trend seemed valid next couple individuals walked store.

This may well anecdotal purely coincidence, feeling folks starting see masks political issue rather one related COVID, especially Brian Kemp vs Keisha Bottoms going on. real irony here. government need inject us microchips track us, ourselves. Nevermind average protestor age demographic largely asymptomatic carriers get people sick. EVERYBODY made mistakes first, starting top. Point New York actually learned saving lives. Can’t say Trump nearly every state. k fine  close weekends, lack deaths comes monday. True story: brother work pharmacy NYC deliveries, comes back store one day dropping delivery guy hazmat suit comes requesting “the human remains” trucks line outside. like horror movie people outside NYC didn’t see part. Actually he's wrong. Stress cause it. say say sometimes happens really stressed people. Canada wants keep levels low... smart close borders. 

Sad thing Canadians following rules taking seriously Americans are. Canada much better right now. Yet states actual blanket mask requirement. Many ones statewide mask policies turn workplaces, specific workplaces, specific workers, etc. states blanket, ""if indoors outside home, masks required"" policy. I'm even sure state actually gone far. list: simple ""wear mask leave home"" rule could useful. recorded 3.2% growth GDP quarter, coming negative first quarter. literally way besides impeachment House removal Senate stop president. horror show totally exposed massive flaws way government. Trump survived process thanks corrupt party. fears one free whatever hell wants do. one stop him. [pandemic earlier Yup. Trust corrupted CDC FDA. Idk live city 50% people dick nose. People dumb everywhere lot blame go around, sure. Probably better approach somewhere middle. sure. 
Moving sick people nursing homes great idea. 
Thanks dead old people. 
Dr Fraudci. surprised someone ""buy"" opinion. said even necessarily apply me. I, like many people, things would rather keep private. obsession hentai, sex toys buy, fact frequent McDonalds 5x per week completely irrelevant anything government might want me, would bother track put file? 

And well, no, be. think anybody really \*wants\* constantly watched tracked. reality peoples' phones tapped, file every person living country, even significant portion them. restrictions countries, them. best governments anyone else little effort. even then, governments need warrants, approval, many steps so. 13 year old kid hour government could month.

It take much get somebody's gps location history, email account, hell abundance personal information people publicly post Facebook social media. even ""friends only"", literally public anyone see. cry government able track them. reality world things private longer so. claim world's governments conspiring wiretap entire populations databases everyone, want microchip us, brainwash us 5g, nonsense simply absurd. 

Nobody cares enough enough bother building file wiretap phone. worst government might track phone's geotagging even data usually aggregated nearly impossible tell individual people's locations anyway. worried individuals hacking looking blackmail material want get arms tracked. extension that, platforms likely use, phone have, internet provider, tech have, tracks sends data companies design better products. purchase things sign platforms, agreeing let sell data use however wish. I'd much worried Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple rest government is. Well jobs interact public get paid.

Its health care workers. around people covid19 lot general population. ya. Higher rates. Thanks good sport. hope sincerity fix country. Agree completely. Honestly easier read Reddit threads, far reality felt like reading book people’s actual thoughts. Nobody defending that. EVERYBODY made mistakes beginning, starting top. point New York learned got shit together saving lives. Can’t say Trump states. live lot people wear masks; it’s pretty great. personally count one hand amount people I’ve seen without masks one place frequent, grocery store. People pretty responsible part I’ve seen/heard others. place perfect, I’m sure people aren’t taking precautions, Vermont fairly rural well may something it? enemy American lives enemy America. threat American lives threat America. ""If wearing mask, must sick!"" disappointed came across it. practice one largest area lot people trust man's judgement. located? want move. perfectly reasonable disagreement wording terms, instead amending wording it’s electronic anklet time.

From distance, it’s becoming clearer clearer country raging dumpster fire run managed morons. GF shat stomach once. work Home Depot. haven’t stopped hiring Bless Chicago closed two restaurants/brewery first time violated rules capacity limits mask requirements. biggest problem isn’t Americans don’t believe science, plenty do. It’s belief science - like everything else - sharply divided among political lines. One party believes science listening scientific experts. anti-science, extremely proud ignorance gleefully rejects scientists - unless use somehow talking point pushing. I’m sure guess party which. think even schools schools Europe fully open. students come shifts still learning remotely. Maybe 14 hours week they're in-class learning. Even though New York one better states, spread quickly schools--look Israel. 10 cases day decided fully open schools they're worse first wave. China bois. Never attribute stupidity adequately explained Greed. world wrong him?! mean became global epicenter infection? Gee thanks fauci adult son autism spectrum, reason motor skill tying things continued elude despite many years attempts teach him. even though can’t that, still understands Trump followers frighteningly ignorant! Two scenarios:
1. Reinfection general rare possible. One thousand higher..
2. Immunity lasts 4-6 months, maybe bit longer. many places high rates infection twice last 6 months, US states giving us data soon. sound like massive fucking idiot tbh Yeah, like people stopped killing people would murders. That’s worst part man 

I mean kids cages border, loss influence worldwide, turning blind eye KSA's dismemberment Khashoggi, unidentified federal officers taking people Portland custody, 100k COVID deaths like *right there* yea, fact Trump's failures make us likely vote competent civil servants real tragedy. Anyone remember guy claimed end world coming? Harold Camping thought Jesus would return 2011. happen, said ""flabbergasted.""

People believe wild stuff shocked everyone saying whole time actually right. honestly think people detached reality right they’ve forgotten actually means die. act like death doesn’t exist can’t happen anyone know. One dementia one sociopath. Good job, America. clinging another bias called Belief Perseverence.

Maybe read article wait information rather immediately deciding try voice skepticism. 

This doctor voicing anomaly part scientific process well. corona viruses circulation deadly. I'm sorry true. Cholesterol comes animal products, especially fatty ones. saturated fat. natural trans-fats exist dairy meat.

This say saturated fat palm oil coconut oil much better, probably problematic; that's suggested nicecream (banana cream), could find 0 cholesterol ice creams made palm oil coconut oil (they probably marked vegan). That's great. Perhaps area lot tourists lax it. People stores better people outside. Church Street marketplace glaring amount people masks, especially people dining outdoors. comparison...

On day Florida 15000 cases, 100 cases EVERY 10 MINUTES! Ah okay thanks! loved ones die hoax (in minds)? Median age keeps creeping too. 33 last month 41 in: kids disease factories stupid, selfish shit. 


Also: sky blue, water found wet. say testing numbers positive rate wrong. There's article talks ""Florida’s hidden data skews COVID-19 test results"" here's link count positive test once,” Alina Alonso, head Palm Beach County Department Health, told Palm Beach County commissioners July 7. 
“[**We count negative tests reasons people testing negative getting multiple test results. positives name captured once,” said. 
That means person multiple negative tests counted several times. Boy, thought middle-school mean girls couldn’t toxic... Virtually everything unknown point. Going secluded cottage today. Contactless entry. understand needing 4 new walls. I'm bit nervous gas station bathrooms, hopefully gloves, masks, wipes, sanitizer enough momentary brushes. People forget crisis happening, 'normal' sacrifice almost always needed. 

Sacrifice word I've noticed people understand reality of. Literally happened last day Christmas Break last year. One students came door throw jacket. Made immediate u turn nurse, didn’t come back. least two students day threw up. ended flu first week break. 

Like you, I’m positive parents send kid school despite symptoms don’t want deal it. MLS back since July 8th. believe test every day unless someone team tests positive, daily 14 days. ...except ton people can’t even cover basic expenses like housing food let alone pennies left save ninja-editing commented, oops. 

Hard believe Sunday numbers. I've began post ""no shit"" posts / studies

Allows move life minimum level anger going forward. working well me. High cholesterol associated longer life. We're talking multi-decade, multi-ethnicity, multi-country studies prove over, over, again. Could COVID change this? Sure.  sinus infection possibly covid spent month able taste smell anything.

You almost certainly covid. There's proof already spread Europe earlier thought. yeah really involved I'm gonna talk this. Italy live Croatia know geography understand.  I’ve worked teens I’m sure humanity April (I think) worried long term side effects testicles. read follow thats still pote trial issue 1. Mother nature smart fuck, 2. even worse nightmare 20+ years. Fascism loves crisis. Societal controls? We're talking controlling pandemic that's happening RIGHT NOW. get it, like govt telling do. point to! Let's what's right RIGHT, we're told to. question, wearing mask public continues save lives I'll continue long takes. really big deal. debt owe fellow man *living society*. Taking away freedoms suppression. I’m saying evil agenda, I’m saying reaction sensationalised virus unforgivable. There’s loads coronavirus’s already circulation around world deadly constantly mutating - body ever gave shit covid. sensible lockdown would’ve isolated age bracket risk, one size fits approach wasting lives healthy younger people. don’t get live twice. friend high school teacher CT, USA. first plan fall alternating online vs school days school always half capacity. current plan high school students online, they’ll use high school classrooms disperse elementary middle school students greater areas, high school students stay home. least people thinking it. need Frazier. Even Carter respects limits lie.

Hell, call McKay too. could use laugh. probably went waterfront, checked Church, St. right? basically densely populated section state right there.

Due geography area slopes towards lake presents illusion greater density is. driven(or even walked) campus UVM top hill, would able look towards waterfront see ends abruptly; turned around face spine green mountains would seen city sprawl towards Williston south-east scattered pockets housing towards north-east St. Albans. Prove they're skipped over. 

Doesn't matter anyway. said sticks: ANYONE sick deserves get help. Anyone Jeeeez 87 deaths reported Sunday, gonna good week. Name city, I'll go look you. 31% infection rate. 31% kids tested turned positive. tends happen there's reluctance swab kids unless show obvious symptoms obviously exposed. hard swab younger kids. wishful thinking

I get saying, that's funny interpretation ""wishful"" context. protests city attend? statement could truth support protests. could case. know every restaurant saw outside seating, hardly anybody masks on. stores pretty diligent though. seemed top proven points beyond giving ""opinion"". Wapo article follows cited timeline Trump administrations inaction, clearly refuting unsubstantiated personal opinions. Thank making easy, righties alike. There's much point wearing N95s unless also wearing goggles enclosed safety glasses. I'm leaning toward simple lack transmission vector opportunities. Unless we're throwing bunch infected kids room seeing happens, children subject immensely reduced social contact past four months. 

Send infected 5 year old work office eight hours without wearing mask, I'd bet get similar transmission rate adult.  economy!!!! still comfortable amount daily cases New York...it fluctuating 600-900 / day last several weeks. % positive good still concerning numbers sky rocket. Hopefully, indoor dining suspension bars (without food) prevent excess crowding. shit bullshit it? dad's lawyer pissed received letter apparently full incorrect legal information &amp; threatened sue. school district let go happened True, problem people bottom really choice. There's money save rent food take funds. So, work paying enough.

If, example, similar law somehow passed required rainy day fund receiving percentage income, money would come somewhere. Wages would increased.

However, happen. Again, small businesses might better behaved deserving (i honestly know), companies increase wages. Even awesome year, share anyone top-level employees; frankly need gift. countries able open schools don’t epidemic community spread, argument moot.

Also, factors pediatricians consider making recommendation? fail consider harm done non-students increased community spread analysis incomplete flawed. Yeah, I’m Tennessee local plan seems somewhat reasonable. Elementary going back masks social distancing reduced class sizes everyone option go virtual. I’m nurse husband teacher, short hiring nanny, we’re going what’s available 7 year old necessity. I’m super nervous, frankly, given lack clear leadership data telling us safely, I’m kind mercy local districts hope make right choices. Yeah see big jump deaths hospitals start turning people away. simply BS talking point argument gung ho forcing schools reopen. doubt, people die. teacher infant home fall, loss. much shame country right now. studies indicate immunity likely long-lived? fair gofundme America's national healthcare system. long immunity lasts bell curve. know three months long short.

But reports I've seen aveen around 3-4 months. Since seen shorter ( though might also due lack exposure opportunity, ongoing local outbreak, hard tell reinfection long lasting infection ) says perhaps min 3-4 months. coming weeks virus circulating again, seeing reinfection cases 3+ months ago. Americans Disabilities Act, gives specific allowances disabled people. 

There mask exemption. people printing fake cards saying exemptions wearing mask ADA prevents asking specifics, fact committing federal crime impersonating DoJ.  wait till market tanks november blame trump get biden in. thats guess happen. ways anti-mask attitude perplexing ways accurate reflection notsogood side American culture. want virus behind us. matter stance, agree we'll much better virus contained eradicated. 

There's significant logistical issue overcome though. many people want ways meaning want single thing help control eradicate covid want too. Sorry man, can't ways. individual person part this. either part problem part solution. going jack shit help, least honest realize perpetuating problem every single day nothing. source doesn’t really address questions. But... but... can't stand kids home. NEED go back school! /sarcasm hope school award 6th grade graduation day ""Perfect Attendance K - 6"" sinks hellhole whence came, never seen again. salaried employees, option part benefits package elect short-term long-term disability insurance. probably $15 year total both.

We person team diagnosed leukemia. early process, leukemia nonetheless. exhausted short-term disability, even long-term disability insurance approaching would make actually job. high dollar sales people, compensation completely dependent upon commissions.

I say, everyone team management chain rallied around him. ran accounts him, sharing responsibility across 10 salespeople, knowing absolutely would personally make commissions sales made, making could get commissions. addition, absolute worst part treatment really difficult anything let alone procure prepare food, one extended team included 25 people signed night bring food following day.

Our management changed since happened, truly question would now. Sadly. even many rough times I've almost 11 year tenure company, I'm fence staying going, remember happened person compassionate willing step everybody team actually was. core team helped still there. imagine would same. question whether management would support something like lay short-term disability expired. arent done every job. jobs get replacement trained afternoon couple videos training session. Plus, gets harder replace workers would expect relaxing hiring standards would come purchasing PPE emplpyees.

For ones are, business probably gets money back months. employees get scared buy PPE, that's win win owner.

Considering little businesses care employee safety general, combined pictures health care workers garbage bags countless stories retail workers basically left totally unprotected job tell need know free market chosen think things could do. One would eliminate attendance penalties allow kids miss class anytime parents tell school they‘re sick. terms convenience, could make resources available students miss class make easier make missed exam. giving clear messaging students come school feel kind symptoms, right thing do, go long way eliminating peer pressure push sickness. Yes! primarily weather conditions slow spreading virus effect condtions human behavior. That’s exactly worries me. study SK concluded children 10 half likely spread it, didn’t contact trace kids didn’t symptoms, there’s bit gap knowledge.

If turns kids spread fine, haven’t opportunity, reopening schools without strict adherence precautions turn bad super fast. Parents used school system daycare long public schools existed Capitalism things well, like finding efficiencies, innovation, responding supply demand forces far better top-down system ever could. equipped deal things fit paradigms, especially public health. factory dumps waste river saves lot money, since people downstream main customers ""company"" care get sick die. humans try get together form governments (on paper) profit motive exist promote health, happiness, personal freedom.

My original comment started saying government dysfunctional longer fulfill need, we're left hoping corporations right thing us, we're dystopian situation. district CA went online wife discussed quitting best figure asked full return. think addition lot sick teachers going see massive strikes resignations states attempt go full reopening. Ugh worse, little holes went school made life horrible Right, I'll let scientists lead way one, hearsay. Also school requirements academic pressures. Study: humans ages still humans Let tell Tale... actually St. Albans worst town saw. mean people social distancing saw hardly masks. Maybe part day something knows. Ha! one took while. 

[I offer response another upvote. Read comment lol. said 2 numbers. Covid beds. Non covid beds aka elective beds. 

Your source said stopping elective surgeries make room covid. 

The way happen 2 sets beds. 2 numbers. 


Hospitals treating 100% covid patients. Real men ain’t afraid get virus face. Sling face don’t care work one... Wow someone maga name complaining people taking coronavirus seriously. irony hurts. group adults? lumping together? 

Big difference adult behavior 40 minutes house. deads last years garbage

That overstating things. pretty strong way 1993 even 1994 1995 powerful shows.  Dude first 6 words farther truth, EVERY video see BLM recently arent wearing masks except police trying stop tearing cities ruining countless peoples  I’d rather governed complete moron. I’ll take neither move Georgia! possible guy got exposed again. I'm guessing bean counter figured would negatively affect sales compared local stores enforce masks. they're probably saying bad press nothing outweighs that.

This profit optics. Well run companies things(spend money) affect bottom line unless they're forced financially positive them.

It's business decision, ""we care health public"" one. shit,you telling virus age discriminant would though..... Ya I'm current teacher taking pay cut next year due covid budget issues. I'm sure work usual school starts (beyond increased risk family). situation teaching already felt absurd last year everything ""fine” see near future even ""good"" schools can't get staffing.

Smart move daughter's part. feels like teaching dying career. Honestly crazy, employed otherwise, saving right now. Way many unknowns next 6 months never hurts extra cash bank. "" Anne Frank"" / proper call, hard call many similar cases delayed never made.  similar experience elementary student, also Texas. really sick missed multiple days school. told mom legality missing much school blah blah blah. mom frankly told would send sick. TBF There's prolly chance sick student, clearly sick ex. coughing would make first class w/o sent out. could totally wrong here. Yeah, in-person school rough physically go work. know little kid. Glad young kids mess! Or, know, falls line studies indicating immunity likely long lived.

&amp;#x200B;

Outlier immunity lost 3 months.. 6 months. We'll covid/flu season out. Hopefully annual vaccination enough. facts? mother severe bacterial meningitis. yes, I'm well aware damage cause. 

Even though correct that, hypothetically, infection cause meningitis, chances getting meningitis *any* infection near zero. 

Stop hyperbolic this. cases confirmed meningitis related Covid-19, insignificant even start speculating yet. prepare anything, simply know outspread is. Yes is. thought doomers Reddit wanted everyone didn’t wear mask die. wrong? Arizona's latest case/death numbers, plus 7-day promising hard White House declare victory immediately. Give week. It’d like discovered asbestos bad, people went stores sprayed people’s faces good reason.

Or drove road dumped coal fumes hybrid vehicles.

Oh wait... 101 exactly bode well longevity. India going worst hit country over. Republicans never allowed run country again! Fucking monstrosities! Um, duh. Hospitalizations NM pretty flat. Went low 114 174, bit 160 That’s bold strategy, cotton. let’s see plays US even slowing spread. Sweden's daily deaths (and thus, logically, sum confirmed unconfirmed cases) peaked April continuously decreases since, US's graphs still rise. bad article makes sound, one wonder much US left couple years. family seen parents 3 months

Wow whole 3 months! mean dick, concept many people live far families (across country even different countries) can't afford planes? Even COVID seen grandpa 3 years mother 12 months. lot people normal, gonna bit challenge gaining empathy one.

Plus change fact many countries able this, hear people similar ""genes"".

We're going entire country collapse miss grandma 3 months. That's absurd. Thinking that's sadly case.  son IEP last year really synced teachers made massive progress.  know part kids get fine think age would capable bringing home expose higher risk real concern. logic probably says young healthy kids = young healthy parents always case  coronavirus works manner (i.e. long term immunity),



And SARS? Studies show 17 years later still immune it. saying one way another long immune one, that's still determined. saying cannot factually say every coronavirus long term immunity. bad versus countries according Twitter link above. 23÷ increase USA lower compared Spain(+56÷) Italy (+44÷) France (+31÷) etc ... sub incredibly skewed toward US start GoFundMe account. couldn’t bothered wear mask protect us supposed help pay medical bills? 

While railing paying people's bills!  see getting much better foreseeable future. They've 1% positivity rate long time now, even state open month+. oh, sure Chinese people simply concerned virus itself. entire country wants nothing another SARS-like epidemic, whole approach mainland least. slogan late Jan - Feb ""stay home, starve virus"".

This applies Hong Kong too, region hit particularly hard SARS. Hong Kong people intent averting another outbreak well.


Edit: cynical comment insinuate, CCP would really wanted populace that's content ""living virus"". Instead, get population outbreak swiftly properly managed regime-toppling event. epidemic cornered CCP like never can't bloody believe even get enjoy legitimacy horrendously certain reputable countries (*cough* US UK parts EU *cough cough*) done. Swan song catch it, god wanted (so nobody could anything die it, god wanted (so nobody could anything anyway).

I talking District Manager day literally said this. ""If God says time go, time go."" time argue attitude so, dangerous people like using justify taking precautions protect people.

If God always decides time us go, though, surely seen life expectancies increase decades advent modern medicine. alone tells us control fate. like man stranded island waiting God save him, ships pass waves saying - ""God save me."" Astoria entered chat think works. Thank you! Yeah, said thing looked common core math actually is. That’s always way math head made sense teach way. don’t get fuss about, “that’s we’ve always done it”. Good perpetuating “it’s hard” myth kids. They’ll better people way ahead curve get higher level classes. bars without food bullshit. Bars put baloney sandwich menu boom serve food.  also doesn’t mean reinfection anywhere near bad thanks cells. antibodies gone, studies shown cells remain strong. UK, states? Can’t wait start teaching high school Aug 3 school district making masks optional social distancing going happen “when feasible.” kids pediatrician advised moving appointments scheduled Fall/Winter summer predicts they’ll slammed flu season kicks in.

Although said announced schools would start distance learning, fwiw. people barely making rent trouble affording groceries. Dozens millions? 

Careful numbers there. Yes might use presumed undiscovered cases create argument using discover argue find reinfections cases know about... nah that's baloney. evangelical trumper aunt tested positive pretty sick. sisters tried talking sense happened. thought hoax (she doesn’t longer).

Honestly, people may learn hard way. They're real best. states carry them. reluctantly (hopefully temporarily) moved new state recently make final decision knew UTZ state. pennies... stop admitting patients less severe symptoms, tell fight home. I'm afraid lost plot point. single debate I've seen schools reopening mentioned option different options based age

I live Norway older children still home younger children went back school. Teens tweens can't go anywhere without parents permission. blame parents here. understand hard keep kids home, there's bit cold going around maybe parents suck up? use good practices things smart way. can't surrender virus.

156,000 people recovered Texas. pretty big number too. Right mask issue nutshell. Conservatives trained think someone contradicts themselves, they’ve lost argument everything say ignored. It’s easy talk radio hosts get guests contradict themselves. It’s many elections them.

But see happens logic applied toward mask-wearing. Officials said wear masks, contradicted themselves. conservatives, means credibility can’t believed now. It’s killed thousands. Right Right, let fix analogy can't nitpick it.

The entire shirt dirty. needs washed. still stain come single wash. stain needs extra help/attention/effort restore shirt was. 

The country needs support, yes that's true, poor communities need substantially help rich middle income communities. again, everyone needs it. Certain communities need focused support Super disappointed this, thought would today Florida got 20k cases.

u/Governor_DeSantis what's take this? ""But Tuesday afternoon!!! wanna go drink wine shop home goods! take 'em, fair me!""

-97% Karens surveyed exact response.     need **national** lockdown, governments efficient enough detect small outbreaks implement small **localize** lockdown. British government task? bff. tiny part taking seriously. rest simply showing true (mean selfish) personality. Totally bonkers  You’ve seen comments Instagram, studies too. 

What weird way dismiss studies. 

I could say saw comments Instagram study way dismiss it. saying kids won’t can’t spread it, saying people saying leaving comments social media lie. I’m terrified honestly, governor Murphy said we’re 100% going back person fall numbers aren’t low enough feel safe yet. one person gets goes school building small enough literally dozens people catch single day. I've gone first scared, sad, pissed. 

New York gave us chance get ready this, selfish people shitty government blew it.... exactly worries me. Exteriors self cleaning Singapore weather 30c raining every day. Maybe aircon interiors Singaporeans relatively wealthy stupid taking extra precautions there.

So really good news us northern hemisphere winter. really good news anywhere lots people confined space like nightclub, bar tube train. Godspeed Or… hospitals full cannot accept people.

This joke. surprised see shelves visited US!

I remember thinking “that’s stupid made name” watching mad men Random: interesting username. referencing?  think Finland fine. Seems averaging [around seven new confirmed cases per last month, ""[an army contact built handle potential second wave.

Guessing bothered mask mandate yet infected moment, similar Norway.

Just gotta watch Salminen guy, try pull another Sweden. :) Yes, don’t break ribs you’re right.

Edit: I’m kidding it’s always true. People tend scared hurt person need pump hard CPR effective often fractures ribs. You’ve surpassed level knowledge lol

I remember textbooks saying something along lines ‘viruses never 100% removed, suppressed point undetectable’ 

I’ve thought ever since wanna learn symptoms, get tested? hell - get tested since fever? Media best half way there. excuse using common sense. figures didn’t came black hat white rabbit resides. Can’t wait go back work middle school 3 weeks. Yayyyyy. national lockdown beginning. northeast one several months. Sadly, could still re-elected Enjoy 60hz! Fuck yes, Italy. cannot blame Italy one thing would happen *any* European country position.

I'm happy this. aunt told it’s millennials’ fault they’re dirty people don’t shower enough. People want someone blame 1 Megabrazillian Gatherings limited? 

[look week ago thing happening Paris, Berlin, Warsaw. clubs pubs full people without masks. likely miscarriages earlier pregnancy. Covid clotting symptom wreaks havoc placenta. Oh think collapse right. January late change competent leadership. US guys clean mess next years. people bullied going work sick COVID. Nothing change future, especially stuff like cold. FTO stands flexible time off. sick days, vacation days, personal days, whatever days employee needs. could theoretically take month August wanted to. I'm motivated job know would s*** show coming back, could. 1 Million tributes Bernie!!! Haha nope Florida man fights gator eats coronavirus breakfast Oh wow!! way!!! Wow! Lol small reddit world!

Ridiculous. know smarter. work could easily done 100% remote, I'm forced go office every day, packed public transport all. course sit day open space without masks without possibility opening windows change air, air conditioning only. That's riskiest situation possible, knows many people forced without need ""it's always done like this"". Even new decree would force people companies wear masks, colleagues care distancing (which 1 meter here) flaunt partied weekends. nightmare. Working meatpacking plant means lots yelling loud machines workers crammed shoulder shoulder, lots droplets flying around getting inhaled people close by. one worst conditions possible transmission virus. Also, there’s fact people “a tickle throat” almost always allergies such. 

So humans never supposed work again? socialize again? tickle might something much worse? 

I mean, isn’t collapse civilization then? coronavirus terms, happened only, 2/3 time passed since birth universe existed passed since then.  think ""not caring"" ""throwing towel"". student debt servitude, million dollar housing market reach most, well documented projection youngest generation lower standard living previous generation. existed pandemic.

Well, blame since repeatedly see pictures healthcare workers wearing surgical masks underneath disposable N95s. That's terrible way it. much better way wear surgical mask *over* N95, allow surgical masks block bigger droplets coarse dusts ""save"" N95. Man shocked hungry despite eating.

Also, kept dumb, constanly fed propoganda young age freedom, making money ""how be"". Voluntary mask usage really high here, mandate statewide people wearing anyway. 

Note: several towns mandated facial coverings public.

Wrong reference claim? someone link researches? Read comments never saw articles Last year particularly bad flu season Australia; 900 deaths. track much lower year, obvious reasons.  That’s complete total lie, keep telling it. I’m sure makes feel better. Mass testing. NY peak getting 50% testing positive rates. capacity test severe symptoms.

With huge expansion testing there's lot mild asymptomatic cases caught before. Though moment several states hitting 20% positive rates worsening.

If want metric change testing look hospitalisations deaths. Epidemiologists actually use deaths estimate true number cases mass testing available.  I’m sorry. words wisdom advice, wanted know read words ache you. I’m sorry. You’re let everyone right now. Without political, like older generation fucked everything youth give fuck infect them. Kind throwing whole FREEDUMB shit back face. Let guess, looked burlington area? Theres plenty cheap places live Vermont Heat lamps?

No. I’m saying rather selfish forced capitalism, people don’t call sick one extra night shift know others forced work public suffer without it. dimwitted it’s laughable. ignorant you? wearing mask propagating pandemic, words contributing infection chain rather blocking it, mask does.

American media calls them, ""Millennials.""

Goddamn Millennials ruining ability crusty old farts call everyone 50 millennial!  hell country even living in. Fuck pathetic continent.  required couple cities. Also statewide public transport. people wear masks anyway. Even mask mandate city would see couple people without masks grocery store wearing wearing correctly. governor concerned would enforced reached retailers input based feedback said mask mandate possible. We're trying ""educate people need wear mask"" route work we'll probably end mandating masks. Places state zero cases zero deaths well nobody goes either likely meant “children” mean “younger high school.” Teenagers line drawn.

Edit: or, maybe never mind. Doctor article points mainly shows us symptomatic kids spread it. still don’t know asymptomatic kids effectively infect people. Lets see, well known (although important job) health care workers despise Torys pull political stunts time try hurt them. don’t believe ethically capable manipulating figures naive ignorant. cut noses spite faces time.

 Mesa Biotech test proper RT-PCR test. supposedly PCR, end get line-based readout much like pregnancy test, think there's kind lateral flow assay detect yes/no DNA amplification.

Both Mesa Biotech test Abbott ID fast, device analyzing 1 sample time. Whereas RT-PCR tests, testing 96 384 samples time (minus controls) multi-well plate format. RT-PCR see shape amplification curve point amplification crosses threshold, gives superior reliability ability measure viral load.

Nothing good course not. typical unions simply negotiate wages working conditions. Police unions operate like organized crime syndicates, complete intimidation tactics subterfuge say people go crazy lockdown. everything lifted, can't handle go deep end.

**This explains a... LOT.** I've boss trust employees suck well. amazed childish behaviour individuals...

So, I'm pretty much always OK WFH days taking sick days. point, nice assholes always try take advantage situations.

3 examples:
1-this guy; Instagram full pictures getting hammered friends match. Videos going party, really late Tuesday.
Wednesday morning. I'm morning coffee office. late team making jokes pics/videos. point knew smashed day, probably coming... like that, workload ok. need make drama. party party, empathize bit...
But 1hr later receive message telling mom sick needed take care her... FFS

2- girl ask WFH day. needs go doctor whatnot. Obviously goes doctor, working time. gave OK anyway. needs finish 1 task. 2hrs max. decide when, how, where... done day.
The morning receive complains department. material delivered bullshit. renamed old file uploaded new.
Later told guys department happy task needed make amendments. ask 'what amendments?'. goes 5 minutes explaining department people always picky work blabla... failed job, delivered something wrong purpose made people work nothing, talk shit people lying face.
At moment I'm still thinking never went doctor day.

3-girl leaving. team decides put money buy something nice. Company pays lunch working hours. people asks time buy present. can't afford propose go together work leaving bit earlier. say no, things do. offer alone, one replied.
The next morning 2 decide go without permission buy present. arrive work 3 hours late 'the shop open yet'. I'm bad guy strict. complain HR micromanaging. FML That’s fine isn’t necessary Every adult? crazy pill mongering. ever make species without mieaculous drug? Can't decline reelected job? said people go crazy lockdowns lifted, everyone goes deep end. told messaged state health care worker day said hospital full. person talking said numbers fake. Pretty much called liar right face. say e time: everyone die eventually, important part die.  Ever thought see day Bush office would seem like welcome breath sanity? Wait minute. pledge allegiance kid exactly? 

Lol. guys weird.  Teacher here...kids come school sick...ALL TIME! cannot tell many times one HS kids straight told me, ""Yeah strep, mom gave one dose sent school,"" ""I fever morning, can't miss 5th period test, I'll go home.""

This happens time. Either vaccine booster they're anticipating people get Covid shot want flu shot too. company work 50 positive cases interested see affected staff members,I first four get first back work live Canada I'm 100% US poli assuming Trump cant cheat voted mail? don’t even know would change mind point (unless extremely high, people communities dropping dead street).

Back late March talking point “Swine Flue killed 12,000 people didn’t shut down!! Covid hasn’t killed near many people!!”

And COVID killed 140,000, folks still don’t give shit. loved one die take seriously. means nothing unless testing random. people got antibody tests self-selected, tells 16% people *think Covid* tested positive it. also says nothing test type reliability even know 16% actually Covid. got false positive going around thinking immune even worse.  Sounds like everyone know lives Colorado Portland complains people moving state like grow Michigan. Death inevitable everyone. triaging patients simply poor prognosis. triaging elderly elderly. lock would work US. cops something culture put with. 

You dream want, it'll never happen. could limit repercussions acting irresponsibly people it, would great.

The situation have, though, one ignorant/irresponsible people gets virus, there's good chance even show symptoms instead infect ""essential"" (read: disposable) workers choice interact them.

So, worth effort. But.. Sp-

No country would let someone hook something like outside dictatorships. Trump building wall. DHS said huge amount money dumped facial recognition software obsolete widespread mask usage... maybe play masks V Vendetta type thing...?

""Stop *deep state* tracking you""  One guy bucket, ten minutes tops. That's low recovery number compared total infected? 8000+ people still infected well? entire state Florida U.S. averages less 18,000 murders year. Less 50 people day.


Yet many people scared wear mask ones stockpiling guns ammo defend crime, even hiding away safe suburbs. Terrified would happen local police lost funding. believe Ohio’s numbers come Ohio Department Health unaffected federal change. data faulty, inaccurate.

As faulty inaccurate estimates number infections time?  appreciate perspective. guess don’t understand pointing lack transparency data mean we’re purposely undercounting (it could be, discounting). There’s really actual evidence that.

This whole sub really concerns intelligent people accept one viewpoint - corrupt administration purposely undercounting cases deaths, r3d states purposely manipulating data.

Oh didn't. New York learned little Wuhan Lombardy. waited way long lock down, mandate masks recently, home quarantine, deliberately sent infected patients nursing homes. Cuomo talks good game, state still infections deaths. nothing proud NY State government response.

Now rest America learning little Wuhan, Lombardy, New York.

Wuhan six week lockdown successfully suppressed virus. 

After this, daily new cases 930/day NY State rising. that's ""doing correctly"", completely screwed. understand isn't. going set precedence upcoming start NHL playoffs, given hub cities Canada  seen top mask resting bottom lip yet? saw 2 yesterday know that's called. Sounds like teachers need sue district state PTSD. 2 largest states - Texas &amp; Florida - peaked yet. Oh wait, maybe - report death pneumonia. I'm sorry that. think another away put today's numbers perspective entire pandemic. So, think, right business open. think Gov. Cuomo saying ""we're going shut down"" beginning right approach, gets bad NY got kind change know place know corona not. 11m old &amp; seems cold days everything sounds like corona &amp; found idiot work occasions wears mask work &amp; refuses anywhere else. Stupidity. 

My son seems stuffy nose &amp; nasel congestion. seem but, know headache, seems sinus pressure head aches. may fever briefly working thermometer (had like 4 baby bags &amp; hospital according son &amp; fever 58 140... F.... yeah). finally able order two Amazon shipped incorrectly returned &amp; get new ones Wednesday. also sore throat think chemicals sprayed couch clean it. could feel throat burning &amp; coughing night since son bed. 

The main reason I'm asking also can't find anywhere available test &amp; would rather make 11m old go test. though. anyone know sounds like colds corona? read one article criticized New York sending sick people nursing OH GOSH *worst* shortness breath, nausea, aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, etc. late March gave way PAINFUL ear infection pril. kept lingering symptoms returned recently mid-July. Sure's fun knowing severe anxiety mild COVID!!!!!!!!! :D could put light catheter run body! that’s ludicrous claim. extract DNA, set PCR, run PCR thermal cycler, analyze results, get PhD call results, report results physician, reports results patient. 

Just first step extracting DNA takes 20 min. Thank much this! recently came across post someone know said wasn’t going vote November! made upset. 

We vote massive numbers overcome voter suppression happen. Cunt face USA winning fuck this. Sadly I've feeling way while. says ""In Uk"" ""In Britain"" multiple times. makes multiple references UK. pretty much UK. Children MI NY developed kowasaki type infection recovering. all, rare, enough worry. May ask WFM job? people died Sweden. would denial care elderly Sweden compared Nordic countries would seen larger proportion deaths higher ages. public data shows countrymen reported it. Argue them.

And note...just Swedes general died, mean elderly got easy.

Or woods yet.

Good luck stay healthy. Didn’t moving people nursing homes kill thousands people? letting virus spread without regard? 800 people died day month April NYC, month lockdowns went place. improvement NYC doesn’t seem policy related rather herd immunity related. enough show going do? die? ok yet? Queens 3... totally agree here. many people without masks hanging together. But... think March/April hyper aware people wearing masks show rest country attitude needs going forward. keep waiting another spike... especially protests early June. no... they’re part WEARING MASKS!  Thousands people every day month straight keep curve flat. It’s simple insane pretty much rest entire country can’t see goddamn selfish care. 
...Oh look numbers little spike NY. It’s Suffolk county. know, county “Blue lives matter” counter protests couple weeks ago... guess what?!??! idiots weren’t wearing masks. SMH. right...I correct say nothing like happened modern US history, Asian Modern History happened decades. go! Also make good notes states. 

This weekend seems tad messy data can’t pot do? it’s effective treatment state doesn’t immediately make legal really can’t get way. could end pandemic save economy one swoop. think meant bet beans.

Oops. missed one. think Trump extreme personality flaw knowing someone people want something, gets perverse pleasure letting person people it. case, it’s testing. there's line I've heard long time, long time. did, rational conclusion NY absolutely fucking horrible compared every state maybe NJ. Democrat governor. CA well done horrible. PA. anyone else think it’s terrifying don’t know many cases compared knowledgeable? harsh penalties people would never fasten seat belt cars. idiots, one strategy works, fear. That's idiots believe deities, saw lightning bolt chopping trees half, sudden fraud corner makes lot sense talking Gods... humans intelligent animals nothing nothing less. don’t think it’s 9000, think it’s 9000 Brazil, they’ll something countries too. sure 9000 per country maybe got many requests they’ll expand it, it’s probably I’d hard track cases  It’s pretty sad justifications cuomo’s horrible decision. Desantis, he’d pushed office.

And it’s huge shame. Government needs get held accountable horrendous mistakes. Trump needs to, Cuomo needs to. lot officials get keep going affiliation he's still hospital of: why? think part “fuck it” mentality lockdown didn’t work. told 15 days stop spread. didn’t work. shutdowns kept getting pushed back every weeks weeks end. didn’t work. whey “fill blank” different?
Humans aren’t designed isolation especially indefinitely. Thank god everyone except school aged children get corona... Gov. Cuomo tell how, or, watch video library Cuomo left posterity, explains it!

Even idiot able understand it. Yeah sure shipping elderly death intentionally infecting pinnacle ethical medical management. That's true, bad. yeah much chance happening Senate duty. Let spice flow cOvId-19 AiN't ReAl! Something's gonna inflammtor-ing right. Interesting first day numbers must go White House instead independent reporting agencies total number cases 10k fewer yesterday. Part problem CDC kept changing recommendations daily. Initially wear N95 bear minimum. found weren’t enough changed guidelines. said initially surgical masks nothing save health care workers. pandemic shown many weaknesses country. parties suck play blame game agenda nothing ever changes. go one way
Then couple years later go back, keep electing fucking people. one saying _should_ to.

But, choices people have? Perfect opportunity friends, family, financial backers, pastor die hard supporters side, supporting hour need.

Please, show respect he's shown you.

-Dune least 1% Americans confirmed infected (real number look believe me). 50 governors US (again real number). believed 10x cases known (again real number). see least 5 governors infected. yeah, I'd surprised him. fact 4.5 governors likely know. Ah yes golden standard releasing prisoners locking nursing homes.  Embrace couch church now. Louisiana announced release numbers Saturday longer, release days Sunday. We've averaging 2,000 cases last week. Land free, home brave. vaccines take years develop. 

Trump nasty habit overpromising underdelivering. It’s worse ! , hidroxychloroquine it’s known tested drug specific use (not COVID-19) chlorine dioxide widely known false cure HIV, malaria, hepatitis viruses, H1N1 flu virus, common colds, autism, acne, cancer, Covid-19.  preventing spread pandemic satanic, maybe we've sending prayers wrong direction. R read something people saying trump purposefully botching handling crisis avoid getting re-elected. They’re saying first time recent history Texas considered battleground state. Either way it’s shame, countries successfully returned back normal U.S states still first wave. value power money more.

Edit: changed greed money  Vaccine *possible* Summer 2021. Full inoculation put world back to. normal? Maybe Summer 2022. 

It's like flu shot. personally take flu shots, would take COVID shot. imagine many folks take COVID shot.  almost people saying lying... Also, loss immunity would likely normal distribution sort, would expect see tip left tail far. likely cases recovery least 2-3 months ago. So, dozen ""re-infections"" _could_ anomalous, _could_ also statistically consistent general likely loss immunity 1 year less timescale. know are. also think fight family flee Russia avoid prosecution. makes upset many people can’t see this. isn’t even conspiracy theory, it’s stating current events. 
I vodka pool take mind idiots listening husband’s beach playlist. Go one. New York City. 3 friends die insultingto memory rest country learned nothing deaths. Yep, this. want testing would numerical proof uncontrolled outbreak. Yes Obiwan horrible? country shit like this? White house gone looney toones. Lol governor stitt? Hell fuck no! won’t pray scumbag. bite dust clenched jaw fucking care. Fuck republican bastards follow. Thoughts Fucking prayers ass someone living Vietnam witness afar (we've 94 days without case outside quarantine), state learning other, country learning one another. 

At point obvious without getting number cases 0, continuing precaution that, never going end. idea ""flattening curve"" means start rolling back restrictions obvious myth. look around! Bruh what. really fucked april may. Like sorry NYC NYS closed way late, didn’t immediately mandate masks, sig. amount time greater number cases Cali (until newsom bungled it). NYS NYC def models success, especially foreign countries (such south korea) major cities populations millions far less rate infection death. thing made people think Cuomo giving nice presentations simultaneously healthcare austerity. recently cases significantly declines 25k fucking died. Remember Trump said whoever wants test get test? I'm sure cutting funding make happen /s turdsuckingcuntbucket?

Sir, clearly &lt;clears STEPHEN MILLER. end era. 
Top deck 747 always best way cross Atlantic (since Concord ended).  Can’t believe anyone ever believed “I’m business man” “I’ll hire best” “You get tired winning” crap.

Sorry, thanks trying part solution.. New Yorker, we’re well? Weren’t worst Florida flexed us took spot we’re second worst? her, that's like saying East West Fear leadership failures, yes indeed. 100,000 dead Americans single protest ever took place? failed long could blame black people.

This failure GOP leadership. worst response country (or continent matter).   Dr. Fauci said surge driven young people don’t care get it. Omg comments watch MLB games crowds? Personally, I’m interested gameplay. let parents NICU without masks. can't even... Wasnt NY's death rate 4x national average? violently shook Donald Rumsfelds Bob Doles hands. saying future already stated fact might true. live Florida heard would next NY months. Right mortality rate 10% NY way terrible numbers. 

I’ll say NY NJs response virus cuomo’s actions ass, terrible lead highest mortality rates world. 

You can’t pretend like NY good job moving fairy future land Florida worse.  terrible part good reasons dislike 5G, mainly gives even finer location tracking, idiots debate going get shut down. shoving thousands nursing homes together letting explode? It’s 110% handled worst way possible point. could back almost-normal now. 👏👏 say wait month 

You’ve saying months lol. First 2 weeks bro, it’s month. sub control.  Sharpen G U L L N E WMDs!!!!!!

/s nonsense. mayor still telling people go giant gatherings giving movie recommendations knew here. wish New York handled well imagination. would thousands fewer dead. governor handled poorly regardless states doing. doesn’t matter Florida states currently handling poorly, can’t put NY pedestal good example, blundered it. Again, post Fauci saying NY handled correctly. 

They not, you’re delusional think otherwise.    Trump personally making vaccine /s Deaths fact spiking, lag positive testing spikes several weeks. say sure, learned better way treating virus, indeed deaths spiking.

Having said that, again, states need learn New York done last months keep infection rate down.  children risk. know small percentage die. suffer organ damage brain lesions....but it’s obviously acceptable.  could sworn talking Georgia. know why. Long day work.

I'll leave original comment testament failure. Thank correction. likely one imo it’s good they’re cautious prefer term American Idiot. Given current fractured, disorganized Federal Government, I'm confident we'll coherent plan distribute available vaccine. Isn’t New York state deaths, deaths/million? Oh, yeah, can't wait 'til Ohio starts stuffing sick people nursing homes healthy, at-risk patients. surrounding states start barring us entry crematoriums capacity?

Fuckin' coastals. salt water must corrode brain, something. sound nice. misconception people shamed wearing masks though. handful people wear public I’ve never anybody look funny wearing one. I’ve seen videos never seen here. snowbirds coming FL, QUARANTINING CORRECTLY ALL, numbers going soon. Already another confirmed case county last 2 weeks. This. one talking it?
Thousands people died hands hey, let’s hail king cuomo. invade Kuwait though. know iraq war fought oil control? Well actually started gulf war. America allies Kuwait, governments economic understanding.

So didn’t threaten American lives, threaten American economy. that’s worth going war you’re POTUS guess. concerned. Fear mongering article. Masks supposedly protect others infection. stop virus attached water droplets. people realize virus several microns size cloth rah won’t stop shit form inhaling that. finished arguing somebody claimed fatality one actually dying. guess following example support. Stupidity lack sympathy.  Eugenics criminal neglect. Dr. Fauci probably losing much sleep right now, saw happen LGBT community AIDS Reagan administration, happening COVID Black Brown people country. Every day. new record, new outrage. It’s getting regoddamndiculous! Lots crazy folk OK. Somehow guy one biggest republican fields ever barred business multiple states fraud. picked shadiest possible candidate, dems ran guy makes Biden look exciting. look Drew Edmondson speaking, see can’t get anyone elected here.  That's factor. well close proximity first major outbreak encouraging take seriously.

The northeast got punched mouth hard beginning, even managed get things back right track implementing proper response. Reported mumbers usually lower weekends Every single newspaper around country post articles like this. one happens Utah. ignorant selfish human beings everywhere they're coming woodwork feast virus. 'shitshow' everywhere hospitals become overrun, it'll unique (like never happened anywhere else) 'learn us, learn we're going to'. one learns anyone. That's problem.  nursing homes? best options available? Classic gop response  seem way get them, facts mean nothing them. know people high risk (morbidly obese, 70+, cancer survivor types) continue life normal, finding reason think go (even shutdown). know anyone who's actually diagnosed yet, know exposed get tested, seem changed behavior. think people change political stance even someone close died covid. really think people far gone make excuses continue behaving way been. seem reasoning them, disheartening. 

That said, I'm also trying reason them. seems completely pointless try, energy argue them. point I've kind accepted lot people know might end dying sick behavior. know probably sounds awful, true. figure access information do, freely available. choose watch certain ""news"" station beginning F, guess. 

I also know people claim super worried, take kids restaurants, malls indoor places time. One friend vacation 3 times since March, soon restaurants opened dine ate twice day. even went casino opened again. baffling me; worried, take unnecessary risks? Seems crazy, are. Maybe refrigerated trucks become necessary, finally realize things bad. 

The thing take care family. We've stayed home since middle March, go inside stores all. Curbside pickup occasional take delivery, that's it. really feels though that's way stay safe, especially things control. Except whole “putting active cases nursing homes” thing. 10x deaths per capita places. know modern algorithms aren’t even trying determine relevant you? actually trying increase “trust level” platform showing think want, trust high platform takes “mind control” said, feeds content PLATFORM wants see.

If actions suggest don’t want see content platform trust goes down, means won’t spend much time platform goes back tries feed content relevant you, trust high enough again.

How messed that? I'm sure understand fact is. Shutting whole economy without solid justification needs lot courage shoulder blame later. Lets hypothetically say early shut down. ppl saved bcos early shut others may protesting shutdown “too haste early basis”, caused livehood financial ruins. God give u brain used instead acting like selfish idiots could Lesser Stitt really Georgiaed comment bro. complete Georgia-up. Smh bro. Georgia wrong you? 1) lower age groups, go critical care status much older age groups, 2) improvements treatments, especially steroids il-6 inhibitors, 3) hospitals better prepared current influx made preparations, 4) lag. Deaths lag confirmed cases considerably.  fuckery  estimate.  figure schools start back up, help. public schools, colleges, different regions - something start back up. I'm confident government clamp things start getting control. There's point panicking though. Met Elon Musk? certainly hope Elon smart enough wear mask socially distance. not, really care. 

I believe you. believe acendotes representative sample. loved comment section still come road trip east west virus passes. lot idiots, lot great people nation beautiful. travelled lot places world, traveling US favorite. love seeing nature wildlife, personally find Utah California especially beautiful things. clearly don’t work healthcare realize mind boggling amount bureaucracy red tape required almost maneuver. idea field hospitals equipment technology collaboration staff required deal patients  Seeing girls drunken behind hit ground makes think many times heard knew car accident someone died drunken driver went bruises.

Really sad reminded low humans fall... mean, fucks sake LIKE wearing them, obnoxious something face. 

But know what? suck I'm house. 

Part adult things need WANT to. Damn you’re right I’m terribly ashamed hoping one gets new coronavirus. I’ve misguided factored children likely home exposure adults do? going jobs running store sure teenagers are. places still really close NYC, city America reliance mass transit like NYC. 

Texas Florida basically refused take real measures prevent spread, situation would much worse NYC safety measures things NYC did. Good Thanks letting know - noted it! Whoa figured out! Alert National Bureau Economic Research immediately revise nonsense paper! isn’t republican conservative subreddits ? can’t party come terms insanity? Denver acquaintance mine e said 5+ days get results worth I’ve said before, think even world stable enough next summer there’s way games happen many qualifying events supposed happening year. Minister Marco Mendicino said Saturday federal government denied Blue Jays' request play Rogers Centre, confirming official familiar matter told Associated Press ahead team given clearance city provincial governments play home stadium awaiting approval Canada's federal government.

As someone living Ontario I'm glad Feds agree. I'm sure provincial government did. Probably Ford knew would denied, expects people angry, wants able blame PM. 🙄 need wait years. already know poor ethnic minorities contracting disease dying higher rates wealthy white US: 

So far Great Equalizer I've able find age, appears people 70's 80's dying basically rates regardless income/wealth ethnicity. beg anybody provide different data however. 50 percent positive nyc awhile. Lot people infected confirmed sure It... isn’t. whole point placebo compare something effect. reply, read see answers question. going build Faraday Cage house, vanish tracking system, come investigate exactly supposed be. I'm genuinely interested it. documented many super spreader events already, question. evidence backed contact tracing test results showing infections came from. We've done churches, bars, concerts, athletic teams, business conferences, sorts events. want see one protests. People keep saying never showing it. feel guilty keeping daughter (HS junior) least fall semester, whole immediate family risk factors can’t take chance. 

I hope turns I’m overreacting, honestly believe they’ll likely shutting schools around October they’ll serious staff shortages due people quarantine people weeks due illness.  phase 3 testing military, amongst places around world. parents borderline like that. get it. people afraid microchips would anyway? like would really cognizant minds taken lol random me. Sometimes, would every months. Sometimes, would week. ablation done catheter. simple. procedure, trigger episodes XRay identify coming why. Then, based decide do. reason ablation, medication work well me. treat Tachycardia changed recently. seen cardiologist recently problem, would recommend so. treatment options last 20 years changed. Buy heart monitor like one capture episode share doctor: smartwatches also capture EKGs doctors comfortable using. Check smartwatch one them. doctor may recommend wearing heart monitor weeks properly capture rhythm.

Your primary care doctor able order preliminary testing wait appointment cardiologist. Since knew getting procedure, purposely bought insurance plan year would fully cover it. changing plan next year. ask yourself: would Satan do? That's administration except slightly better PR. They'll come across incoherent people think they're stupid reckless instead evil. Fauci says “not caring” meant refer directly behave accordance state mandates guidelines set doctors global health entities. 

I’m currently Texas seeing firsthand Texans living, ACCORDANCE adapt pandemic, ie, social distancing. Texas’ situation hand, right now, according google, housing 319,000 cases. People behaving like prior pandemic pandemic effectively “propagating” it. Maybe don’t care, maybe they’re idiots, don’t give hoot call it. 

I feel like probably get what’s Fauci saying. better. better internet. Don’t contribute dumb shit people see, please. Hope pick I’m putting down. Plus obscene pensions, regular Cost Living Adjustments, insider trading, bribes tons ""freebees"". Totobobo knockoff best explanation I’ve read far, via r/bestof : wearing USA become loyalty test certain groups people. countries dealing COVID-19 crisis, mask wearing simply preventative public health measure. USA, however President Trump initially downplayed significance pandemic criticized this. result doubled signaled followers group treat disease fake people taking disease seriously would enemies. u/Boxboy7 correctly pointed out, Trump explicitly signaled people wearing face masks enemy.  live groups Loyalty Tests important part human social cohesion. Loyalty Test involves kind social signal tells people group belong to. bigger dangerous signal is, valuable in-group. example, Yakuza Japan get extravagant full body tattoos cut pinky demonstrate loyalty group. demonstrate put extreme amounts pain permanently marked part gang. extreme expression loyalty basically stated group forever die, literally cannot leave gang rejoin normal society marked life. return group protect you.  human social groups Loyalty Tests signals one sort another. Sometimes obvious thing like flying flag, speaking recognizable accent language. could also sharing certain articles memes social media. filling posts memes supporting BLM clearly signalling loyalty certain social group. often part rituals, especially seeking admission group. Think hazing college fraternities sororities. Extreme hazing means earned spot.  way, face masks sort ideal expression loyalty certain social groups today's society. Face masks visible marker, literally worn face, seat identity. historical precedent, see Anti-Facemask League formed San Francisco dealt Spanish Flu 1918. general, Loyalty Tests powerful socially visible incur risk. one see action action easy riskless, kind worthless demonstrating loyalty. Refusing wear face mask extremely visible incurs risk getting debilitating disease thus extremely powerful loyalty test.” switched method Ontario hard hit province good think Zombie party. wish people would stop attributing American situation result idiocy. conditions deliberately constructed people benefit them. Extra helping stupid, one. want pay taxes.

Perhaps taxes levied appropriate, since taxes wealthy neutered.

The golden ages father laying house, family, car, etc tax rate went 90% absurdly wealthy.

Now, people like pay taxes uber wealthy.

Taxes allowed survive. country function. Roads. Schools. Fire departments. Police(they're need reform), EPA (we smog like China), etc.

Taxes regulations protect us predatory capitalism. longer child workers. longer extraordinarily dangerous work conditions. *don't* appropriate minimum wage, sadly, roughly 20 dollars compared 1955 minimum wage.

Yet people clamor taxes. realizing utterly *fucked* they'd world corporate supremacy. They'd little serf. Many little now.

A recent report shows minimum wage can't support shelter city. Yet used support whole family, picket fence, car, kids, etc. sub shouldn’t exist.

Attempting stifle people's desire openly discuss something important lives impossible, authoritarian place free society.

If like sub, (Edit: meaning redditors. 'you' read salty, meant be) free leave reason hold opinion virus. 

That ""opinionated discussion"" means. 

Things like potential economic impacts, potential adoption rates vaccine infinite number coronavirus related topics purely scientific objective nature, still worthy sub still exists, spreading misinformation mods refuse crack 

Cite? everyone kept calling Trump pandemic would probably stick. Las Vegas economy still OK, right?

/s 

Leadership US become ghoulish completely opposite doing.    definitely forecasting need start setting field hospitals. Otherwise, looking EMS roadside care leave. Proud NYER rn also made two people eat fruit hey... stop thinking people legitimate political disagreement. cult. They're national security threat. Unfortunately recently trend America avoid personal responsibility blame people. people become even fatter quarantine. dumb post. You’re really judging NYC hit harder states high death rate? understand months ago, knew next nothing COVID treat it, right? months later, healthcare professionals much experience virus treatments work don’t work. There’s one reason right death rate might higher places hit earlier on. yeah, keep acting like NYC somehow blame high death rate. 

Do understand population density is? understand NYC region one most, **the** most, densely population region US? California huge state major cities CA sprawling. People spread out. Population density low. CA problem traffic - everyone drives everywhere things apart, even inside cities. That’s stark contrast NYC people walk take subway get need be. 

Are purposefully ignoring key difference never left town/city live in? dumb? really understand population density contributes spread virus? 

It’s completely absurd criticize NYC getting hit hard virus. time anyone knew COVID threat, already spread people already getting sick. Judge based handled things *after* knew actually problem. That’s CA judged harshly. states already figured combat spread numbers go back up. fact CA needs done order contain virus makes worthy ridicule. Deal put damn mask. know that? Florida 10% mortality rate don’t need one. statements make sense, Europe’s outbreak started NYs yet NY far worse even hardest hit EU country. 

You don’t care facts you’ll never accept NYs response shit, hope next time comes around stupidity won’t cost lives family members. Props Vermont, let's keep good work. Sincerely, New Jersey .. it’s anyone wants post made shit anonymously? Like anon 4chan? funds hospitals? Federal government via Medicare Medicaid

The ship mess bureaucracy red tape. also Cuomo doing. ship made decisions ship going going operate. They're total badasses exposed nose mouth, like weak sheeple wear masks protect others. happened State rights? live New York. remember moment Cuomo sent first order schools needed shut down. heard Covid really threat US yet, maybe cases, would never effect me. college, everyone looking phones showing emails. remember asking professer ""there's way right""?. 

We told days left school cut short. never said goodbye anyone school (I'm transferring another college fall). never knew last day last seems strange me. 

I met friends school happened socially awkward friendships ended pandemic. I'm stuck home now, dont ever go unless necessary. hard anywhere go, watching young son 24/7, dealing family. reality know responsibility stay home. know ending anytime soon. know I'll go without human contact months. hard is, lives important happiness. Unfortunately, low income, minorities especially, getting hit hardest. Plus Vermont pretty sparse sizable population compared states... Stupid stupid listens Trump. says full July 17th, ICU bed configuration staffing phase 1 full. 

Phase 2 converting non-ICU patients stay homes, phase 3 using places like convention center Go ahead captain space monkey! mean Donaldo. annoy you? fuckin embarrassing it’s literally like 6 months since virus shows still aren’t capable containing cases still rising like crazy fuckin Karen anti mask country. excuses considering fact it’s like usa people living slums it’s impossible avoid virus since places close like country like Brazil India. I’m ashamed country respond virus. It’s embarrassment country world. Possibly coincidence cold flu since started taking CBD many years ago. used get sick least year this. Yes, right. never realized saw comment it, late repost another title, note it. idk unpopular feel national news. Makes party throwers feel energized confident Italy. Let's hope get worse autumn! 🙏🙏🙏 live-in boyfriend lost shit one day crowded Walmart. wear masks now, also finally madated public areas state. father ill would likely well. consider boyfriend reasonable individual, think peer pressure gotten hold him. think many men may position, incredibly annoying. Sorry lot people country either incredibly stupid assholes. both. Americans spell realize*

Also, edited headlines ... people think virus doesn’t spread easy depending age? would think that’s common sense holy hell depend sterilizing department much understated. unique battle go doctors intubating multiple times night making sure stylets management. Mad props. Introverts gonna like  love living US, worry may same. Either course correct country brink collapse. don’t know I’m paranoid, worrying. I’m anxious current conditions. Puhleeze...it like they're locked monasteries. phones, TV, internet, gaming, kinds ways reach connect. They're bunch whiny pussies raised helicopter parents. They're weak. RIP, man. Truly good world. Hope name lives forever inspires many people live like did. true all, makes sense live burlington cost much higher think ""that person probably wear seatbelt"" Incredible Democrats started global pandemic hoax countries hurt Trump, also says started China. even consistent hate. ever vax. even 30K Benghazis... Potentially dumb question - normal immune response ceases covid antibody production months, thing happen person introduced pathogen via inoculation? think focus vaccinating President Trump, Jared Kushner, friends. Others go hell. /s Yeah, well, unsavory Governor inviting spread state. Hahahaha beginning end COVID-19


Has anyone seen people


Edit:(by people mean people believe COVID-19 thing) Still attacking something late Feb early March ha e data....sad. yet politicians still doubling stupidity. wonder attacking them... disingenuous much? Dont get hopes Insulting voters spare. like ""AIDS kill you."" Oh cool, young guys getting opportunistic diseases tend affect older men weakened immune system. anyone know sign volunteer? seen forms notices anywhere.   Buckle Ohio. lost good friend Covid yesterday. 40. hoax. real.
Please wear mask. want see loved ones again, wear mask. may get to. pain bad. hurts. wish could said goodbye. sakes, please wear mask. comment teens would incredibly hard time grieving lost loved one hit close home appreciate recognize teacher. lost pastor/mentor way junior year nearly 10 years ago took years able talk without tearing up. 

Grief hard everyone, especially teenagers. know, I’ve experienced it. 

Thank again. students incredibly lucky side. feels like we're right brink Ecuador. first wave March hit Guayaquil brutally hard, scared everyone enough take serious precautions. country get bad, memory fading. Quito right edge, Cuenca, too. see people streets reason, even though mask compliance almost 100%, seems dangerous every day. like everyone needs feel pain directly take seriously...like much ask learn suffering others. I’d love things go back normal too. wanna stop hearing father law fear monger say end world. whoever gets infected 100 percent gonna die. extreme fear needles, god damn im going get vacced asap! (Once vaccine reaches Luxembourg) thought obvious need Gonna lot debt pay said done. provided example drug weird timeline still ignore it. 

Dude providing sources examples still ""I believe you."" lose lose situation matter do. like flu vaccine, may 100% guarantee won’t get it, do, I’ll far less severe? Millions us smart, rational, compassionate human beings!! MILLIONS!!

Unfortunately, also millions dumbasses 😑 although really think voter participation higher, gerrymandering wasn’t severe, immigrants could vote, would led democrats. Sigh. I'm glad write abuse thousand kids Part 1/3:

This long video, covers range issues, viewer questions also answered:

- discusses MATH+ protocol reasons drug choices

- MATH+ steroid use late stage ridiculed, turned correct

- post-recovery issues covid19 patients real treatments fix that

- MATH+ protocol deemphasized HCQ controversy, may role early use interviews Dr Paul Marik (author MATH+ protocol) - (1 hour 20 minutes)

----

Here present rough transcript (basically notes took listening video):


Dr Paul Marik: 2016 developed treatment sepsis


- hydrocortisole

- ascorbic acid (vitamin c)

- thiamine

treated 1600 patients good outcomes

when covid19 arrived realized many similarities bacterial sepsis covid19

there differences too

so adapted protocol


CFR - case fatality rate vs rest US


around world hospital mortality - pretty consistent - 24pct

many patients still hospital number maybe low

(also depending locality hospitals may choosing admit worst patients)

our mortality 6.1pct

fortunately ventilator dependent patients

one problems NY patients gotten lung injury remain ventilator


fortunately patients

why ?

goal prevent patients going ventilator

some need go ventilator - treat aggressively - fortunately manage wean ventilator


----

6:40 - serious disease - flu
once lung issues start treat really aggressively

WHO pushing supportive care (as say ""there known treatment"")
but supportive care damages lungs
people get chronic lung disease

important treat early downregulate inflammation
and decrease risk pulmonary injury (lung)



----

8:30 - Dr Paul Marik - MATH+ protocol PDF Care treatment protocol targeting key pathologic processes achieved near uniform success, begun within 6 hours COVID-19 patients presenting shortness breath and/or arterial desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen. early initiation treatment could systematically achieved, need mechanical ventilators ICU beds decrease dramatically. systematic used MATH+ protocol 2 hospital USA reduced hospital mortality COVID-19 approximately 3.5%


2 page - peak virus patient becomes symptomatic

after day 5-10 innate immunity kicks ln

then virus gets lower respiratory areas
and virus expands more

(so could reduce nasal flushes breathing steam/drugs safe human kill virus ?)

ie patients transition lung/pulmonary phase need go hospital get anti-inflammatory ie corticosteroids ..

ie misleading ie happy hypoxia etc
so pulse oximeter shows lower
then need go hospital


(what guarantee hospital go give - patlent present chart drug want ?)


ie helps get symptomatic 5-10 day period above


so time HCQ - specific IL-6 general immunomodulation


should wait - longer wait harder cytokine storm becomes reverse


----

16:00 - virus becomes quite weak (from upper respiratory tract - usually tested) - within 1 week symptoms

that starts show effects lungs/pulmonary ..

so virus killing
but immune response

""virus gone, dealing inflammatory response""

(but isnt virus lower respiratory tract - like virus gone away body - esp gotten blood vessels due leaky vessels - attacking blood vessel walls etc)


----

17:00 - graph shows virus going upper respiratory tract

but still visible PCR ..

(could virus fragments ?)

antibody production goes 2nd-3rd week slides bit ..


(so outcomes different early/fast specific immune response vs patient slower/later response ?)

(but blood clots supposedly already started happening even hypoxia sets 1 week symptoms - clotting due innate immune response ? - slow HCQ etc ? - HCQ slow innate immune response ? - clotting starting precisely specific immune response starting ramp time ie first week first symptoms going 2nd-3rd week)


----

18:10 - virus immune responses usually IgM happen first IgG happen later, covid19 unique responses starting TOGETHER ..

(the graph shows IgM peaking 1-2 days earlier IgG, IgM going down, IgG going slowly)

IgG going slowly may mean long term immunity may last 6months-12months

(but suggest long term immune response may remain memory T-cells ?)

(by way, IgG go time faster way ? cause/mechanism ?)

SARS-COV-1 shown many IgG remained 2 years started going ..


----

20:00 - graph
viremia goes time inflammatory response goes up

and oxygen saturation going 1 week

but oxygen saturation going means clotting already started - ie inflammatory response going start symptoms ..


so say avoid corticosteroids giving early ..

why problem viremia already decline start symptoms


----

22:30 - questions

host's steroid production completely inadequate downregulate inflammation

so need aggressive corticosteroid treatment

maximal high doses steroids


----

25:40 - recovery people still die stroke

post-sepsis syndrome - significant dysfunction

inflammatory response still active

post-sepsis syndrome - year still inflammatory markers


CRP good marker
still symptoms check CRP
and need short course corticosteroids

or data suggest
statins anti-inflammatory

if give statins high CRP - even normal cholesterol - helps them

need downregulate inflammation

and inflammation causing clotting

another aspirin anti-inflammation

(what doses ?)

another d-dimer

so watch CRP, d-dimer

you decide - patient different

post-covid19 syndrome reality - psychological

patients tell 2-3 months recovery - tired, listless etc.


has individualized - doctor supervision

- short course steroids

- statins

- aspirins


----

30:00 - dr - experience long haul cases - 2-3 day course steroids works like magic



pulse oximeter reading

whole clinical judgement - generally try intubating

earlier tendency intubate

now avoid - high flow cannula (prone positioning)


at home - SpO2 94 esp falls walk around - go hospital


----

33:40 - corticosteroids, vitamin c, thiamine - synergy

people think herbalists
they dont understand science

vitamin c corticosteroid - synergistic anti-inflammatory

vitamin c enhances anti-inflammatory actions glucocorticoids

multiple mechanisms

both act NF-kappaB (?) switch inflammation

vitamin c prevents oxidation glucocorticoid receptor
allowing work

corticosteroids increase uptake vitamin c cell

""its like marriage made heaven""

for viral infection - covid19 switches type 1 interferon

one cool things vitamin c - viral infections

we know type 1 interferon primary antiviral mechanism

what covid19 smart - switches gene transcription type 1 interferon

that wicked virus


vitamin c switches type 1 interferon

so addition anti-inflammatory
properties
enhancing glucocorticoids
it also antiviral effects

so work hand hand

its simple safe


thiamine important many biological processes

you cant make energy - ATP - without thiamine
thiamine has
antioxidant
anti-inflammatory
properties

they go well together

are cheap, safe



----

at 38:30 minute mark - long haulers

almost certainly due virus - virus gone

this due lingering effects host immune response virus switched off

is astonishing thing - see ICUs - inflammatory response goes weeks even therapy

lingering effect host immune response

the way switch with
corticosteroids
statins
aspirin

this tricky - done medical supervision

the CRP really useful biomarker follow patient


40:10 - many general practitioners going shrug patient psychosomatic etc. - think really real physical issues addressed think big deal, crazy many places figured it'd bad CA NYC spread out. really reliable freely changed absolutely anyone? Im convinced. Fact: Neanderthals died longer exist.

Less year ain't even close enough time that. know experience - specifically vaccines. went strict lockdown, economy disaster now... 😱😱😱 strongly hope get pandemic control soon, stay strong USA! I'd love keep many people working remote possible, though. bunch people clogging roads trains every day sit front computer day save capacity people need physically present work? don’t deserve participation trophy


You’re front lines virus fight putting life risk, deserve whole damn trophy really assuming negatives... extrapolating ongoing behavior pattern. ICU beds available 49 Florida hospitals put mask, delivery instructions, ask social distance. habit forgetting time waiting hastily finding shoes etc time. can’t wait afraid getting close others. Even wandering aisles grocery store I’m afraid I’ll get close someone cause uncomfortable. also sucks steer clear others well. sense normalcy would nice. it'll move incrementally, it'll 2023 hits cool million.

That aside, definitely seeing things move price many stores sales less prevalent. think noticed quite much people hunkered buying need taking vacation budget kind staying intact. think get people realize can't go vacation eat much we'll start take notice. 4th July. nice.

Battery powered air mattress made nicer. 100% correct spin false narrative. tried looking news report Oxford vaccine search results dodgy sites think amount people anti vax loud reality minority. Currently 91% children get MMR vaccine. Yes loud minority get it, get 85-90% population vaccinated, herd Spring Summer 2005. Also let virus kill vulnerable population % people refuse get these? honestly think going way higher USA. record, would love get new year. Moderna could say Well, it’s 1.5 now. 1.4 posted originally two days ago. took screenshot  volunteer opened recruiting yet? I'm interested so. Really how? specific? 

Poverty issue. course. poverty social class, race. 

For example, burning city blocks business groumd create food deserts locals. Needing go get food farther say, via public transit likely affect poor. 

Ironically, going mass protests bound infect people, too. see lot black people also see LOT white people hundreds photographs online. qhen talked protesters, seem want risk. So, well, picked fate proudly. 

I would say Vitamin deficient likely likely culprit. academic papers showed steong indicator bad outcomes.

 Along lack education work customer-facing jobs, bit affecta poor general. fluke, dead heat polls [for month saying Biden pull off. Trump probably officially put effort money Texas. looking competitive validated several times over, traditionally apathetic non-voters, 3rd party voters &amp; liberals motivated go vote previous Republican blowout elections motivation vote.

Trump may win find hard believe continued mounting failures he'll able pull away enough Texas point next months feel comfortable. He'll waste time money instead crucial swing states risk suffering probably biggest embarrassment possible modern electoral history: letting Texas flip blue. would like Democrat bad California flipped red. Source? vaccine also creates cells along antibodies. lot vaccines trying increase create COVID antibodies. antibodies aren’t terribly long term. protection, even call that, might months long. 

The Oxford/AZN vaccine creates antibodies cells. cells provide much longer immune responses. similar situation. Ended getting engineering degree studying home, showing tests labs. get great grades, made sure enough. Online classes would made lot sense!


Now run online business. I've working home past 7 years. Coronavirus world catching me. :) symptoms displaying? Kids pretty snotty best times.... imagine corona kid would like. sign up? can't find anything study's website. mayor said Los Angeles “on brink” new widespread stay-at-home orders LA County, quarter California’s population, continued see state’s largest increase confirmed coronavirus cases. 

Just already stop posturing. I've seen enough people around LA acting like self-entitled pricks know getting better take action. Like virus penetrating aveoli. Probably people make point seem part agenda. accurate statement, many times add ellipsis end see it'll filled in.

Perhaps that's unfair, see lot people drawing bad conclusions good data. Thanks Obama

/s people applying jobs pandemic? isn’t yet 5 standard deviations. That'd 0.00006 percent chance true. went ""Everywhere!!!!"" ""it's common was"". moving goalposts. understand this, opposite? know diagnosed hiv cancer faced concept death swallowed pretty well (and put things place prevent via treatment).
Maybe something happen personally first? think im Canadian fundamentally understand lack empathy people suffering, genuinely don't. Yes they're open regularly, mandatory masks tables need 1 meter apart something like I've spotted problem. competent federal leadership, easily could us. Luckily sense, LA likely last county watch list. hope, perhaps ill-founded, Newsom won’t pull back restrictions LA they’re damned sure it’s gonna safe. think great actually happened southern states getting hit harder summer. almost like big f*** people thought warm-weather would kill thing.

Not mention fact hot weather forces people stay indoors Sweet. I’m sick N95 get wet. bought respirator p100 cartridges wear Covid patients. looks apocalyptic isn’t going away anytime soon need change. exactly reconcile people testing positive also symptoms? Ok raises question fuck actually spreading, like assumed main way would happen. literally bars restaurants? think solution refuse service call police complain trespass. may mask police, better damn well enforce customer asked leave business whatever reason. Herd Disability Herd Immunity. understand merely testing people *not* cause people going hospital put ICU? getting test makes sick hospitalized even die.  Remember Team America quote, it? ""It 911x 100... mean 91,100?!"" Ahh, back would deemed catastrophic.. can't believe people see this. first thought fucking joke Trying make excuse open schools also increase 2005. one year compounded 2019 low deaths. start understand drastic far reaching measures cause hundreds thousands casualties worldwide hunger, stress despair worth it.  cool, really really really wish people would stop publishing stuff like peer reviewed. Otherwise person's opinion demonstrated fact yet. think plays part current mistrust ""science"". Even America rehab center, people health insurance willing cover would receive treatment. poor uninsured would fucked like always. Sorry defensive, never tell here. go ""no offense"" mode post source clear opinion. many people take small simple point contort ""you hate asian people"". like shit said dont like mustard hotdogs, get there. magic virus! becomes whatever media needs thwart president. can't cured! can't treated! First going kill grandma going kill grandchildren instead! live surfaces YEARS! first virus human history beat vaccines -- still need vaccine! 

You wear mask. wait-- wear mask protect yourself, wait-- protect others. practice social distancing. wait--you both! wait-- still lock everything again! Wear mask home practice social distancing! 

Mom dad work. kids can't go school. Nobody go outside. Families running money food. stay indoors grandma die! 

And disappear November 4th magic virus! literally replace cashiers computers...

or joke missed it. “It shown employees plastic visors infected. single infection among employees mask.”  fact people arguing kids can't get transmit stupid. Like virus cares age. Asymptomatic spread still provable. Sick people stay home. Move life. getting ridiculous. point, think soccer moms/karens/kyle's *DEMANDING* kid another kid tested COVID.  None tentative plans district address this. admin simply thinks students responsible/empathetic enough follow guidelines. 

I'm curious anyone could say strait face work K- 3rd grade. Super interesting. people spread virus similarly people. Wait, news again? look graphs, many states approaching New York New Jersey's Goten Trunks say did, I? said coroner looking unknown cause unusual.  Look, many banana republic dictators genuine concern people thought enlightened autocracy would truly best countries. smart managed improve conditions people, least time, despite methods.

Can't go equate Trump like that. Nah isn’t. wrong, didn’t lie. risk surface contagion much much lower anything else? mainly spread surfaces groceries food would primary spreader lockdowns showed case. 

It's primarily spread droplets we're kind summer drop people outside.

Here Maryland hot humid Florida yet spike cases. 07/20 effective date US stores. Yes, store instructions. Exactly, disease hit entire world once. there's reason think slight change local weather stop it. 2 year old niece lay sloppy kiss pretty much anyone’s cheek given opportunity. think would cause abnormally low number? data use comes straight AZDHS website. macho, fear, false bravado bullshit crap ruined country years. denier science bravery. Respecting virus kids, cautious cowardice. people say everyone doesn’t live city bumpkin redneck there’s nothing there? Yeah fuck off. made concrete graves lay them. sure right place ask this, it’s place think mostly everyone objective virus. So, live family member immunocompromised pretty much check boxes “at risk.” I’m healthy, I’ve extra careful don’t want spread avoided leaving house unnecessary reasons. don’t work right either, helps that. partner, hand, job puts around lots people family take many precautions. Due reasons, seen while. place live isn’t seeing drop cases % tests positive, knows long for. S/O seemed accepting assures it’s fine, can’t help shake feeling ruining relationship long run. It’s really starting weigh heavily I’m wondering I’m overreacting seeing them. guys think do? family member call, email text virus going lunch friend? need details, damnit. Okay thanks, booo. positive antibody tests also considered positive well? Without breakdown different types results, makes quite difficult analyse. instructions come straight corporate. also tell confidence police alerted extreme cases. wouldnt they?   actually do.... 

I think you’ll find many kids like dropped dead year causes Covid. Lack jobs big one. wouldn’t left, nothing career wanted. Maybe lead charge unionize labor force. Seize means, comrade.  current orders? even hit effective date mask order heard people dying Covid-19 ? number one predictor bad flu season unemployment rate. lower rate worse flu season. People go work sick send kids school kids sick go work. Employers need give people PTO least penalize someone going work sick Agreed. kidding? everyone feels liberated winters, it’s warm sunny people naturally want go places. Winter better half country doesn’t want outside around people. CCP handled wayyyyy better usa. Well, thought legitimate organizations like American Academy Pediatrics specifically state children low infection spread rate school reentry guidance. study know false; crazy Trump people thought this. Total whole life I've spent probably around year life various trips visits family business.

You really feel lackadaisical approach rules interacting people there. even worse family visits 'States. Yeah restaurant doesn’t give shit anymore, stopped throwing away disposable paper menus cause managers said it’s “wasting much toner.” That's suppressive fact. real fact. That's urban areas though. [538 attempted quantify found Vermont 5th least urban state. majority people Vermont fairly spread out.

The problem using density might state there's lot land people live tiny area could state everyone spread evenly across it. They'll give density, one lot rural. matters close people live people. people/land.  reason many middle class wealthy whites want really address racism? upset apple cart full juicy apples. gov ordered stricter guidelines schools follow online LA gets corona watch list. 

Still bad call ADLA, made call online ahead state. still going submit petition Monday admin show community support teachers. would. Saw two people die hospital. Watching one guy choke vomit cause breathe enough make people wear mask. Seeing suffering absolutely change minds. Isn’t one simple question? afraid dying covid?

No, think so. think boil single question; complicated that.

Like you, I'm afraid dying Covid. like you, mask. distance. stay home unless necessary. things believe real, worried others. things understand nature community easily virus spreads one. me. NEVER _me_. _us_. friends. families. love us depend us. clearly understand that, too.

Those believe afraid anyone else. They're afraid believe there's anything afraid of. die there's nothing die from.

That's problem. Truth. kids swapping classrooms high school another major issue.

And governor mentioned eating classrooms cafeterias big enough social distancing. That's horrible idea. Better students eat outside. virus clearly spread air. thing, one comes ""bootstrap bullshit"" flavour. Yes, that's need. also need time. going take data collected many months years confidently assert anything long term immunity. impossible say immune system like 18 months removed initial infection we've looking virus 6 months. One hospital employees talked kids days ago said hopes drive flu shots. feel sorry science illiterate. get sources mainstream media. 

Antibodies type immunity covid-19 produces. misled. 

Also still yet 100% confirmed re-infection. 

The way prove sequence viral infection 2 different sequences. 

What article shared tell is, likely re-infection rather person false positive first time admitted. Sonora Quest states 75% COVID-19 testing reported within 7 days, results may take 10 days. lead contracted tester AZ. Additionally, AZDHS developed consistent pattern last month advising ‘a provider’ missed reporting “deadline” uploading, occurring Monday. Interestingly, reporting cutoff 9a, yet AZDHS takes receive 8a-8:15a that’s facts day. sorry. Forza Italia! great news Love show! Ozark filmed Georgia. conservatives claim constitutional right shop store want absolutely wild me. Like, saying government is/should control store? taught us lot. Thank you. I’m sad everyone believes empirical evidence fact based decisions. many old enough stay home without child care. single debate I've seen schools reopening mentioned option different options based age.

That blows mind too. High School Students could transition fairly easy online education, would free building facilities primary school, kids still learning read write. According vaccine tracker, Sinovac vaccine ahead Oxford vaccine. Imperial College also developing mRNA vaccine doesn’t need inactivated virus, aims reach ‘all billions people world’ infinite booster shots given - unlike Oxford vaccine. Imperial College say there’s ready early next year BioNTech say there’s ready December. Please don’t speak China’s economy without reading least 5 year plans Xi. 

Calling China mixed capitalist gross oversimplification. Give time, feel like going spark change system Thanks. Really interesting. Intense UV light used kill bacteria viruses hard reach spots hospitals. Yes, harmful skin - one goes room used. 

It's solution prevent infection people physically room, rather cleaning patient room next patient, might used depending type infection had. Lauren Ingram Fox News go way downplay one.. “see that?? Kids 10 Half likely spread it! Send back school!!most asymptomatic anyways, don’t know likely spread it, let left fearmongering tactics hold kids back getting education American rights?!” 

- sorry close actually say cared lot. Made sure take many days without getting penalized. That's draw line!!!!!! We're re-exposed sars? Unless challenge reinfection studies can't say immune. Existence cells concur immunity. alternative get completely control like every nation except small handful able do. realize private security instructed corporate remind customers wear masks

I'm fairly certain made up. could true I've read articles coming none say that. wish flight part fight flight, I'm like Polish cavalry; guys attacked tanks horses ones thought would win. never claimed immunity likely long lived. simply know point long lasts. person assertive immunity likely long lived. 

However, least, appears least immunity 3 months. study done almost 20,000 people.

 adhered to. UK, NZ lockdown followed. thought something bad happened nursing homes there? tried murder! Great need much quicker turnaround give contact tracing shot. I've already forgotten Trump OK Putin killing American soldiers. you? idea rural reputation. everyone thread saying exact thing. we're next NY? We're #31 population Oh thanks TIL! sound pretty cool, thought maybe OPs fever making poetic hotels arbnb shut down, tourists nowhere stay. pretty much closes state border. Sry bad, mean introduce new term without forewarning you. But, included definition. may months time chance beat NY individually Unfortunately no. moved Maine hot af. rely window AC units True, we're crowded. Especially since right almost everyone either staying home socially distancing density people way down. Melbourne. 

The main message simply wearing masks, put handled without touching mask. Overall think good call (albeit months late - politicised lot recently) fair policing enforcement joke. really hard care. Also lots people scared virus still need work get food supplies. can't stay home time. Use brain once. They're ""adults."" worry medical benefits time huge worry rest us. still transmit it. school staff adults. understand getting at, since still kill lot people could well cause many school systems collapse teachers get sick many quit stay safe. take extremely small-minded.

Let guess, still think economy would great let virus wash us kill million people? yes united states way behind..completely failing. knew Koffings lol click make sure losing mind smart! Wow. /sarcasm Phish lyrics... modified ... New York &amp; Massachusetts! get Americans. ww2, gladly went war Europe worked together. Rep John Lewis passed today guy always stood black rights. bunch babies now, can't wear mask minutes, saying infringes rights. joke world. everyone, many good people people fight unbearable. No.... think?! Lol  US whole far worse. one living state care taking proper precautions. guys much knowledge treatments, Florida excuse. I've posted elsewhere thread think he's actually tired president trying ensure he'll lose election. personality, would never admit it, take actions towards result. Parent-teacher conferences fun. We're #30 pop. density &amp; ton economy based tourism.

good fortune spared us. we're fucked, VT, schools open back up. Yeah C student go politics B. NJ leads deaths, NY #2... Agreed. believe believe data throw ""fake"". Florida Texas likely easily hit point, advantage learning treat virus better, something New York Italy didn’t have. going blame New York? New York’s problem travel hub Europe, virus hit. hit Florida Texas much later. Florida Texas learned New York, would never problem now.

We country NEVER flattened curve. Hospitals many states fact overrun.

We stop spread. countries fact done that. advice give let people get sick die bad.  No. Children still spread it, school staff *are adults*. Stop reckless nonsense. know wrong re-open schools, unless psychopath care lot people die. policy Cuomo refused publicly acknowledge, taken city's website, led almost quarter deaths country ""correct""? VT rural, surprisingly enough. We're like #30 population density. deep breath

Hehehehe always knew “less smart” people, man, year really brought out. satire?  1. place casket

2. put ground consider kind racism? Muddaskunt Umm what? That's political Yep. company miss 3 consecutive days get medical LOA requiring company approved doctor. 
I’ve sinus infections laid 3 days, find way drag snot dripping self work anyway avoid hassle. tested mice 20 years Good ol G. Carlin Wearing mask isn’t abt politics we're actually pretty much middle pack terms population density. think we're... #30? places like wyoming, new mexico, etc *way* rural. Two breathing holes mask use small N95 filters popped thrown use. using far less material, possible meet demand quickly. also reduces waste. researchers also exploring use different filter material could sterilized reused.

That's pretty cool. Throughout history, privileged elite learn wealth stop steel, poor relearn ones hold power...only forget tiny little slips rights gets picked like stray buffalo, never attaining necessary class consciousness late stop bloodshed. 

Yes, elite due lesson, showing; keep pushing people already brink collapse, unable unwilling believe person nothing left live dangerous ideology. simply cannot stop looting lying even see heading, they've become Little Boy Cried Democrat... 

Or something. Told somebody today messaged health care worker know that's state. said hospital full. person telling said numbers fake lockdowns spread covid.  believed president, that's you. Close enough mean nobody wants virus one wants accident either. Unless that's kink. There's shaming here. close election unless shit really hits fan, think anything. election decided, shall see happens. much this. People need understand 100% calculated purpose. incompetence. negligence. know doing. 

Trump gone deep end. Republicans followed him. There's saving either. 

We way this. honest happening. can't unsee this. dont know anyone therefore doesnt exist?


Do know anyone polio? Lupus?smallpox? dont exist?


Odd logic

Have ever laos? tell dont exist? imagine quickly could took funds dumping stock market buddies instead used coronavirus disease control Thats think. Many eyes watching behind trees.  perfect response  phase works well hoped. Ehhh live work San Diego nearly everyone public wears masks. It’s fault people tourists don’t nuts watching fast narratives change basically day day.

It's one media frenzy other, even completely contradictory saying day before, one cares.  gives shit New York's number would testing available; shut things needed do. think people gyms healthy suffer covid presumptuous obviously, still spread catch it. truly understand people think everything gonna work train clearly heading unfinished bridge. Certainly, learned bit treat deaths lower; unless, course, fucking hospitals full. ""The reason call American Dream asleep believe it."" I’m horny, stupid dammit /r/nottheonion /r/LeopardsAteMyMask still useful? disease bad ever US. needed ever. Name one past pandemic happened. I'll wait. Yeah, it’s combination disgusting, infuriating, scary. best educate people know try push duck duck go everyone. know it’s perfect, it’s better google sure best found. know similar better platforms? What?! Lol. Man... explain that? I'm super curious came conclusion. One first counties covid okay. 

Now, oh over, tripled count headed up. 

Vacation need get back work. want summer fun open up. 

Masks problem long wear chin. 

Social distancing, oh extended family friends. compare Trump ignoring issue two months? Explain. Gates Microsoft supplied computers software schools libraries many used least learned post BS. 
Sadly didnt get critical thinking skill sets. posit he's tired president making sure loses election.

I mean, he's going party now. God, seriously. simple solutions could keep businesses open economy running, discernible reason decided politicize them. implement six-foot distance mask policy, plus outdoor seating applicable possible, could kept largely control limited shutdowns. absolutely reason masks become another thing turned partisan, except demonstrate much anti-science contrarians apparently important basic compassion intelligence. choose strange behaviors virtue signaling. think brave avoid taking simple precautions keep others safe healthy. think wise refuse examine failures try improve yourself. think reckless idiot leader. fact bitching someone unemployment making implies everyone else don’t make much money. part don’t understand? normally? don’t mean age, etc, normally you. people naturally high heart rate.  government going pay administer tests.

30 rich billionaires going buy need keep billions coming in. Pretty simple concept.

Trump stop sale tests NFL. won't.  Bruh think kids invincible something ☠️ wtf foolish anyone believe one man, even good sized group people, ability always make good decisions country 300 million. 

It's gray area yet keep getting 'black white' pushed us, one side undoubtedly correct ignorant. 

Country polarized issue half take Trump's word gospel Fauci. critical thinking ? ""GTFO here"" idiom. in, ""get here, dont know youre talking about"". Im insulted would compare Trump cultists. disagree America without resorting insults  Sans baby Toby one Jareth’s fushigi balls would dishonor died disease. give attention desperately craves. Vegas shot madman casino hotel window. actually see source? much trouble? counties reported

Edit: actually go time zone world meters get info. posted counties orange cases.  Go “yesterday” graph. Lol no. America. test would result behavior change. certainly good country wanting tests citizens help keep alive healthy. think different criteria kindergarten 2nd grade distance learning?

It’s rather pointless kindergarten Reddit. Thanks. Better someone know certain make assumption. hilarious see split teachers parents kid mask compliance. parents go good kids mask wearing easy was....the teachers like, yeah, no, compliance going huge ass pain kids going chew throw other. mean tragic statement still true. extreme outlier case literally made nationwide news. death rate age group still effectively 0.

Edit: fuck math huh? know take vaccine once. Tell it... fucking shit reason referenced user name comment? never seen anything like though, we’ve changed treatments multiple times past 4 months...

Welp, that's cue panic.

Whenever doctor says, ""I've never seen anything like this"", never good sign.  pushing socialism. need 100% immunity get herd immunity, like 70%. Even 30% infected people lose immunity, still herd immunity. remember puking 5+ times 7 mom telling must gotten sent school. shocked Pikachu come pick within hour Illegal mean? know complete travel ban countries? Usually Europe open borders, drive another EU country without even stopping.

During Corona closed borders, everything. Police every border checkpoint, allowed cross important reasons (emergencies, worked across border.. even problematic first weeks). two months work stopped twice day police, show documents I'm allowed go Austria Germany.. came back I'm allowed go back country without 14 day quarantine.

So entirety EU this, US able close least external borders too.. especially getting two warnings, first China, EU (Italy / Spain), plenty time prepare.

All needed lockdown time states, moron chief place called hoax first ""it's going disappear"" let get worse worse. Sometimes articles need written gotta write something. 

In words, shit. Fellow Oklahoman here. Please send help. think opening schools good idea fast spread. Hear out, point Trump admin anything combat virus know it’s due political reasons. People dying amass nothing change mind currently. tens thousands kids go school spreads like crazy effect economy great either something economy crash. 

First it’s kids get it. kids spread teachers parents. teachers stay home sick. Either schools combine classes bring subs. Combining classes cause spread faster. Subs get sick. Within three weeks entire schools infected won’t staff run school. Back parents getting sick. There’s 76 million school aged students. Let’s generous say 10% gets sick. That’s 7 million kids. Let’s assume half parents half single family homes. That’s 3.5million single parents 7 million coparents. 10.5 million parents sick probably spread businesses noticing symptoms can’t afford work. means 7 million sick kids, 10.5 million sick parents, unknown amount sick people parents work with, probably million sick teachers. let’s say conservatively 20 million people corona virus within month. That’s enough population utterly decimate economy. 


We’re already verge civil unrest. many sick tanked economy. see rioting like never before. scary. change area fines attached wearing mask. working part finding ways around it. need essential places opened US take care you. rate death infection accelerated happens community like nursing home. environment general populace lives folks don’t many co-morbiditys. Like cows slaughter house unlikely chance survival.  can’t compare these. Everything named illegal good reason, going school also crime called truancy. Parents arrested it. Last week Texas trouble ordering enough body bags needed parking trailers state used store dead bodies. military sent medics Texas California help many health care workers sick. “empty” beds still warm. mean UK highest deaths EU? go lockdown curb it. works think people would prefer mask lockdown That's really true though, lol. People working Instacart, grocery store clerks, etc., many people poverty working poverty. They're working like work, public good; they're need. goes places Canada.  course. It’s bewildering awareness post-WW2 culture history. People keep bringing WW2 era, none people alive fundamentally changed mid late 20th century rampant corporatism, anti-intellectualism, increasing evangelism, convenience-driven consumerism. general lack true hardship majority Americans period led total lack resilience. cases millions still fringe. proves possible, also low percent chance really huge concern. inflammatory response kids, something like 1/1000 infected kids show response, something reasonably expect happen kids get infected. LAUSD absolutely fucked.  Coming soon thread: Locked political content, despite two largely inseparable. Yeah high schools went online spread resources schools kids can’t stay home. What's going Governor DeathSentence? losing touch. Numbers trending down. /S

No thanks you. 

Are people finally realizing social distancing masks necessary? 

I still think get worse. Opening resorts can't lead anything good. takes one asymptomatic carrier enter park send virus country. Call police people trespassing. Lockdowns terrible work. understand somebody would try avoid (but NY also worked!).

As wearing mask honestly getting used it. Even pandemic ended tomorrow would seriously think wear mask certain situations. example using public transportation. avoid flu cold wearing mask not?

It bad. want go bar wear mask, enter, stay away others, order, drink outside. small annoyance. Even restaurant take mask seated (so distance safe) fir everything else wear it.

It almost impossible find mask lockdown. get one 50 cents. also find fashion masks. Masks rock bands logos. Accessories hurting ears (with emojis!). see girls masks matching color clothes. accessory like scarf. never understand people masks pandemic. Hey aunt asked proof deaths real.  anyone good source send show deaths aren’t made up?  thinking sending one huge New York Times obituary’s long list links people show real people.  wanted check see someone something like already made. promise men much qualified making comparison made get better understanding situation.

Hahahaha. know basics causal research design, think know ""qualified men"" thinking this?

Jesus Christ, joke. beautiful, matter say. let phone posting keep down. Oh is, unless data peer reviewed basically non existent. That's way know doctors really said reasoning behind it. Data peer reviewed level hearsay. Also entire scientific community shows treatment beneficial, crucial. say entire scientific community also mean Sweden's, publication even preprint Swedish scientific community benefits preventing oxygen, refused stating agree governments decision use oxygen therapy patients suffering hypoxia. government decided follow guidelines made non reviewed data world scientific community opposes decision? doctors speak off, even even tried publish reasoning! concern non existent, research. economically better treat vulnerable people. listen it, that's suggested talk doctor importance oxygen therapy severely hypoxic patients, fact vast majority doctors would agree rest world Swedish government decision. Ask doctor, even ask pulmonologist, hematologist, emergency doctor, basically doctor would disagree mysterious GPs Swedish government based decision of. You’re not! district sending mass emails attempting recruit retired teachers substitute. many responses, yet cannot deduce why. mean. Unless get winter anyway. Sane death rate .3 percent (which bad enough is) math around world points much higher flu deadlier 99% us get issues.. becomes long list well accepted horseshit. Common sense.

Americans.

Pick one. NB always stand anthem, always class. difference US need sing it, program messed would shrug say ""no anthem today"" conclusion “entering room AC hour somebody covid19 completely safe” bizarre given facts presented above. would one “completely safe” hour, virus still detectable 16? people say masks work regular breathing. Got something link that? sister teacher OH started really great containing pandemic they've gotten lot worse, partly due dewine bending GOP interests. 


It's really scary sister kidney disease going back classroom filled 20 kids could potentially life threatening. Luckily nephrologist wrote doctor's note saying kids classroom absolutely need wear masks. school doesnt want deal liability litigation they'll least comply making kids wear masks, think absolute bare minimum kids return school anyway whatever.


She go back month ordered n95s (which damn expensive even stock all) I'm afraid even worse shortage schools mandatorily reopened. 2 hours 305, guess not. Man, people talk vaccine order Amazon soon approved. supply chain fucked can't even reliably deliver swabs.

 let's say vaccine approved ready roll out. first tranche doses go government officials, critical federal employees. Next essential workers state level critical staff. finally, that, get yours. That's everything goes swimmingly.

But wait! There's more! double triple quantities turns need booster shot every 6 months year.

Unfortunately, there's already shortage glass vials: we're already hitting snags we're even gate. America, conceivably expect we're going dealing late 2021. symptom modern supply chain contemporary operations management... Zero inventory, max efficiency, on-demand/low lead time global manufacturing, JIT (just time) transportation delivery. reason order entire 2nd season Air Wolf Blu-ray get delivered free 2 days later reason we're terrible times supply chains moment simmer scootch get right Jesus. patient reel expectations touch.

MAGAmorons really thought didnt breathe 1918 pandemic, officials would find decaying bodies homesteads farms months later. I’m things once, pretty much constantly. It’s exhausting. likely, won't.

The truth choice someone's 65-year old nana got despite socially distancing time 21-year old party bro got attending crowded 150-person event, 21-year old getting drugs.

Also good luck substantiating positions. anti-masker lie say got sick despite ""wearing masks observing proper social distancing"". Dude, I'm denying going recession. 

A recession come hard fast, quite possibly catalyst USA's demise.

But going happen within next 5-10 years. actually really like clear. bit tired looking like Darth Vader supermarket.

I miss seeing faces people. forget get sick must something non-related hospitals like make covid cases. news? wouldn’t spread equal rate (given generally much social adults)? Agreed, articles really problematic. ...and news why???? Obviously.. wtf?????? Considering closed 3 weeks spike deaths, doubt it, NYC guess subways thousands positives sent nursing homes primary vectors spread. always assumed inside family unti spread major vector. Reminds hazards assuming. young woman San Antonio, Texas died two weeks ago. supposedly excellent health caught Covid-19 virus. Apparently several hours passed commented nurse thought she'd made big mistake. nurse asked mistake referring to? said I'd heard virus hoax believed it. went without mask. frequented bars stuff like that. kind things young women age would do, naive.
Now hospital can't visit loved ones know I'll live die. 

Unfortunately live 30 years old excellent health. take consideration concern elderly people attending services family's church. right concerned. Unfortunately state Florida like call governor help let alone Supreme Court. American people mislead POTUS care anyone wealth. 

Now know children low risk comes surviving Covid-19. schools necessarily low risk environments churches. think go hurricane season well. besides government employees national guard airlift folks harms way one part large machine. Think volunteers agencies like Redcross, volunteers 60 years age. They're vulnerable age groups. think people honestly understand dealing here. 

Especially man bully pulpit spews lie lie virus. hate say know people call names regardless hurt me. pray want virus care. know care color skin male female. looks good host spread deadly virus. live United States family South France.

They told ever arrived America warned me. XYZ please tell rest extended family buy mask gloves buy. Stock foods mix family's. Keep visit anyone anyone come visit you. Regardless hear media politicians Corona virus real kill you. Stay safe XYZ love all. Since warning know 6 people physically visited years. talking via messenger video chat. 
But 2 6 passed virus. youngest 58 years age. 

I wish people would treat wearing mask like wearing seat belt get vehicle. protects everyone cases vehicle vehicle. unfortunately reason amd maybe mental illness President politicized it. rate we'll never get handle virus. things common sense right America countries well common sense certainly lacking. wish well hope nothing good things come way. Please keep distance family know love care about. follow quarantine guidelines point.
Good luck I’m convinced he’s gotten experimental drug protect it. There’s many close calls WH he’s never gotten it. Can’t wait see comment ages

Edit also don’t know anything lmao Holy hell they're dumb this..

""Now, may thought debate settled conclusively 19th Century banned eight-year-olds working factories sent school.""

Like nothing okay fox. Branson?? Idk   disagree. born NH commutes high paying jobs like 90 min way. Oh yeah don’t mean extent. mean scare tactics helicopters shit.  exactly point trying make now? arguing argue?

Because experience something doesn’t mean eveeybody experiencing way? Saying don’t mean dick actually telling know dick actually don’t care keep talking. Don’t weak minded individual telling somebody don’t mean dick know are.

For us, staying home 3 months without seeing anybody center pandemic country nothing. telling anybody experience different sometimes don’t see family 3 years indeed complete dick. 

Also literally saying ... stayed home 3 months.. that’s good enough you, also easy something?? really don’t get trying get across. even sure read wrote girlfriend sometimes needs work people wear masks get within 6 feet frequently day. mandatory mask rules here. 

 normally wears cloth mask others wearing them, take distance shifts soon, thinking getting better mask (n95) valve protect coworkers also easier time breathing shift since labor intensive.

She's used wearing respirators needed. Oh boy can't wait go back work overcrowded, underfunded, outdated High School weeks! used live I'm really surprised forgot switch accounts? Yeah, that's true. think we're far page. may differ this: hypothesis needs proof. I'm saying acquired immunity untested assertion, seem saying there's proof re-infection. We're right, personal belief perspective prudent, less prone confirmation bias personal hopes wishes infections one done. Anyway...stay safe well there, thanks civil conversation. pretty fucked huh? nihilists must mass orgies right  That's interesting new talking point parents pushing multiple positive tests person count multiple positives Exactly. good chunk population lives dirt road nearest neighbor quarter mile away nearest grocery store 15 minute drive. People social distancing last 200 years. problem way thinking even tell truth, still wouldn’t believe it. come babies aren’t required wear masks?  u ok m8 work grocery store amount black white people wearing masks since see way white people less black people, could see someone misjudge percentages. say though least place work, rarely see Asian person without mask. Usually wear mask I’ve seeing lot less regulars Asian. I’m assuming social distancing more. Even private school teachers abused baby’s sitters wanting go back. Winter coming Missouri loves company....  Good point. multihours closed air classroom massive outbreak = sick kids increased transmission, even &lt;=10 transmit somewhat less fully proven. I’ll hope that’s extreme people see online hear about. sure bit both. maybe really difference countries. people comply. people getting loose things getting better.

From perspective completely insane severely misinformed.

Numbers speak themselves. History speaks itself. coming insanely stupid excuses justify death thousands. get it. That’s low hanging fruit joke. good imaginary internet points.


But yeah. do. And, like many parents across country, I’m trying find safest way best continue children’s education. appreciate OP linking article. 

And boy I’m tired lame old jokes. It’s divisive time country. keep trying stick wedges divide us further? better. better. similar problems dad. one “anti-maskers.” instead asking research, ask help research. got send articles, one way connected talking about. article sent (via text) broken link supposedly showed information hospitals inflating death numbers COVID-19. Yet personally found reliable information hadn’t debunked.

Though method really works someone contact with. matter think effective. various drug approval agencies (FDA US) insisting double-blind, randomzied, demographically representative Phase IIIs *large* scale licensing. 

A *drug* Phase III RCT nowhere near large getting completed two months. Ordinarily take least year. Remdesivir, working breakneck pandemic speed, began Phase III late February published preliminary report 3 months vaccine - care low prevalence side effects, unlike drugs severe disease - sufficient licensing two months ridiculous claim.   shit understanding fought NY solely targeted. wording issue. think legally can't ban state. included sort metric. lot big retailers required mask mandate stores. walmart, target, home depot, many others Mortuary truck races! I've desperately trying catch months. buses every day gone office Lockdown. luck. Every healthy person bit cause get way get back old normal. 

For reason Reddit shut-ins seem ignoring what's going outside dragging long possible. 100% experience well. Every kid failed 4th quarter also failed least 1 previous quarter failed literally every class online instruction. 

During PD looked qualitative analysis compared American class' 3rd 10th grade gradebooks found 90% students identical GPAs. think that's totally indicitive every student group teens, stuck course career. great job (and hope do!), kids get high school decade experience, traumatic, unhelpful led deep maladaptive behaviors. model much considering programming.

That say that, long digital access least generally equitable, see little issue indefinite distance learning, especially considering constant stream good news we're seeing vaccines worldwide (Oxford's looks really strong getting close). No. soon. Garunteed. Sorry. Yeah, wikipedia great starting point first wading researching topic. nothing wikipedia quoted cited accurate. 

I guess rephrase say, ""Wikipedia useful bibliography/reference page topic interest."" Buys shitload time refining treatment well. Nah, went Tahoe Local health department. evidence cyclist Covid-19???
Did miss something here? bunch friends live Orlando/work Disney theme parks they’ve described every business operated like probably wouldn’t nearly bad situation. I’m still personally opening right theme park absolutely luxury item required item, sounds like they’re pretty good job things considered. 25% capacity maybe lines?

I think standing line next someone COVID safe, even masked. needed ramp testing months ago. Sadly family went Florida cause fuck weren’t taking seriously anyway. Missouri represent...  yeah lol agree wikipedia case, clearly airborne unless inventing definition airborne totally are, kind weiner. agree getting pandemic control needs highest priority, whole conversation within context federal pandemic response, portion response. agree money must spent help people stay home, arguing people talking way think should. 

If ever read books community organizing, one common significant points strike cause, look around see else already working issue consider joining group. Organizing new projects goals differ minutiae productive divides important resource - people energy. intubated ventilator sucks lot harder.

Stay safe. best guess hoping kills democrats republicans 😒 scaring democrats away voting republicans. ABC/Disney enough money tell politicians let open up. NBC/Universal, NBA, WWE. Recklessly? I'm Florida, swear every restaurant patio pass upscale community drive way work looks like hosting frat party. 
Generally people wearing masks wait staff actual patrons get closer one another mass orgy. mask thing Plandemic video went around. painful watch Europe (Germany specifically) difficult times def testing relationships CMs trained nearly level security CMs taught basic level security measures told part frontline security. additional eye ears full security be. really great system. clearly said respirator mask, obviously talking masks.

Why trying derail sense instead answering question?

As masks, small ammount accidentally escaping sides far less purposefully blown respirator. claim wise? Science, like everything else USA, primarily profit. trust non-American science ONLY. Cause he's gotten away making stuff entire life. really baffling though. extreme narcissism probably helps feeling shame guilt, too. close whole park wtf big deal  Water wet. ballots always counted.  Yes, lost mail. Things go wromf3 polling place sometimes, too. system whole extremely reliable. unavoidable danger areas like bathrooms. Plexiglass doesn’t protect people directly front behind wait lines. also real lockdowns, proper contact tracing, sufficient testing. We've none that. least easiest thing shown slow virus. Phase 1 test safety vaccine. currently enrolled phase 3, testing efficacy vaccine, currently front runners leading vaccine race. unfortunately won’t know results phase 3 another month unbind trial. meantime, interesting read phase 1 results. already concluded safe considering advanced forward, interesting read specifics. medals meaningless anyway. That's true, Covid-19 [a 0.001% IFR males tested negative it. overwhelmingly likely died something else coronavirus.

The commenter absolutely correct. Articles like encourage deniers. Anyone who's skeptical official stats mainstream media narrative would field day article like this. Humans dumb age? Ok, got it. Trump expected win polls saw, get prepared. mask mandate Alabama lasts two weeks many exceptions. I'm going play bc comment. win, I'll give portion lol. Yep you’ve got figured reliable citable since content changes.

That teachers say.  Hospitals full positivity rate 25 daily must other, top comments praises we'll wishes. Romanians! terrible case disinformation going around major political parties trying politicize pandemic, beware. Lots conspiracy propaganda imported translated directly US Facebook groups (usually religious channels). Also, Supreme Court canceled previous legislation regarding isolation quarantine, so, weeks now, anyone walk quarantine hospitals (even they've tested positive). “Miss guess what? pink eye.” 

I sanitized every single thing kid touched period let keep pencil loaned them. Click bait title fuck BBC, know basic thing evolution? Ofc infectious every person transmits into... Zzz. ONE word - Thalidomide! guys lot concerned three biggest advertising social media platforms filtering content/ads conforms beliefs executives. anybody mentioned much shot cost US?

I'm pretending know answer doubt treatment evolved much 2x daily cases 30% daily deaths. think treatment may account enough drop death case ratio big percentage. I'm US too. Double check insurance. Many big players waiving copays telehealth pandemic Less 18,000 people year get murdered means, reason U.S.



We've 142,000 people die Covid19 four months.



So yeah, may get Covid-19 die, pass family, loved ones, friends, people scared gun toting hillbilly who's scared fellow Americans deadly virus. westernised

Westernization form global spread culture anti-socialist. Spend time Chinese social media, think you’ll surprised find young demographics China aren’t favor they're expanding internationally, happy giving up.

Chinese companies [required partially run employees. private company thing China western capitalism. also subject extreme regulation overseas investment investment must [go National Development Reform longer possible make overseas developments without governmental approval.

China also regularly expropriates private wealth nationalizes private corporations. past week nationalized [several major finance nationalized entire sector rare earth mining.

One major difference private commercial investment China common, majority investment capital comes state owned banks (the world's largest financial institutions). 

Banking capital China controlled state state controlled Property development

Private companies cannot land China, purchase use-leases government CPC limited exceptions direct ownership. notably, farmland required collectively owned.

Chinese capitalism transplantation Western capitalism China, much system still control communist party. dont worry credit card debt keep giving new ones.

Until dont keep taking credit cards.

The U.S. immune real world much thinks is. Look fucked believing special affected pandemic.

The U.S. losing far faith world stage seem realize. worst shape developed nation. nothing fix it. inspire confidence. Lack confidence mean fluctuating currency. fluctuating much, worth businesses deal risk sales U.S. becoming loss president decided print another trillion dollars. happens one sell us anything? Gotta print money government keep buying stuff. Contact tracers? must one fancy states gives fuck trying. live state folks (TX) contact multiple covid positive people. contacted anyone. Lol expect see almost every sub visit....hmm   sad read man, God bless soul Keep holding buddy, remain hopeful America shit Iran got 25 million cases. pass $2200 year per person. 7 people family. would throw friends bus misbehaving keep pass. Thankfully friends know act park me. I'm outside Seattle thirty minutes we're proudly progressive. Capital Hill great well outlying neighborhoods downtown area. Housing costs killing vibe though. forget fact infection spreads. statistic measures long term impact illness survivors.

Schools infection vector full stop. Lol I’m happy didn’t die social flirty part funny! pandemic showed many people kids really seem hate anything them. Nice! Hopefully vaccine shows good. Good you! good luck you! 😁 someone ELI5. know long-term consequenses side effects, short development time? 

Just curious. I'm way :). start mass production hoax? Trump bigliest mask supply ever needed give out. /S Wikipedia great starting point. go find source wikipedia, find sources source, on. 

I never cited wikipedia, cited articles found wikipedia, reading them, course. 

The automatic ""wikipedia reliable source"" argument started teachers/administrators understand internet. use like use source, healthy dose skepticism tracking sources, there's real reason use it. can't wear mask... wear FACE shield! nothing. know. headline awful. shared article seems promising important. You’re still too. greatly appreciate that. I’m immune compromised, wish people would courteous stay home unless they’ve gotta go work/groceries. I'm sorry fail process information comment? Given viruses deleterious side effects may persist life assume one too. 

What kind bullshit thinking use? don’t disagree  socially distancing, hard droplets hit eyes, since eyes suck droplets air like nose/mouth do. still benefit, smaller benefit mask cases. both? we’ll two vaccine manufacturers? ;____; Right replaying thst China’s fault trying deflect responsibility everything happened after. Yes. China fucked up. many countries nothing information came out. us continues fail. Canada failed react quick enough shut us border over.

There lots blame go around sure China isn’t US, Brazil countries still suffering large outbreaks. they're gonna make wear pants, I'm gonna make wear masks! even background security detail, still include part training? Nice! Thank insight. :) Yes, important every single day know exact number infected persons every country Earth four paragraphs data every 1 50,000 chance outlying case.

How else supposed ""stay current"" obsessively watching entire world, right? You’re gonna win lottery tomorrow Uhhhh, shit. thought always know younger people higher risk disease vector. guys ever kid Daycare? motherfuckers sick time. Isn’t common sense? really need study experts in? Thanks impact larger someone else wears mask protect you. 

But wearing mask protect still help, less so. 

So people involved situation wear masks, actually lot prevent spread Wait, breathe too?? ever make woman wear condom whilst wearing one.  People denial reinfection.

Weve seen enough anecdotal evidence since january know true.

That said...the severity doesnt seem everyone get reinfected. bears watching nothing panic about.

Ill propose something controversial biologist buddy told me.

There also strong possibility virus goes latent inside CNS evades immune system. know attacks CNS know viruses definitely go dormant reactivate inside CNS (herpes..is one crawls nerve endings uses nerves shielding kmmune system)

Many viruses bacteria hide central nervous system go latent years randomly emerge. sounds scary, dont know enough. thank you! i'm hoping well likely, student council trying plan zoom events throughout year. exact quote surely said seriousness somewhere country. you’re saying hospitals free tanning beds? It’s populist way. Logic facts disregarded- it’s moral outrage emotion. communist attitude: ""

I realize Scandinavia Germany communist countries. Wow, learn something new every day. well making good life choices.

There plenty RN-BSN's right sick leave whose employers refuse cover days missed COVID-19. Taco Bell meanwhile giving employees sick leave + paid days missed COVID. Amazing. hope holds true. 

And someone tells me, aware vaccine released September doesn’t mean pandemic ends September. get 300 million doses AstraZeneca making US rolled end year, lot reason hope mostly-normal 2021. 

Hopefully countries similar access vaccine, too. countries don’t seem many selfish dumb citizens US, accomplish masks, distancing care fellow citizen, clearly need drug way this.  mean potential vaccine? possible make vaccine-induced immunity last longer illness-caused immunity? don’t....not enough test availability..my state still using protocol determine gets them... Given mode transmission sneezed droplets suspended air short period time, seems obvious. That's also mask openings skin mask. rate, Florida surpass California number two slot total known infections week.

Hell, may surpass NYs known cases two weeks can't get control. I’m sure. people aren’t taking seriously probably people predisposed learn people’s suffering. forged identity afraid virus wearing masks. It’s hard convince somebody believe something identify strongly believing it.  one way reach herd immunity REALLY FAST. This.... still high daily cases. Dude see pictures protesters? Thousands packed like sardines crowd, vs 25 kids least 3ft away time, what's outside going do? Blow virus away? Hes open racist. Maybe that's true real hope vaccine either. left tractor supply...only maybe 10% even employees wearing them. Im going email corporate shortly...no sense that!
Edit: Ohh sent email ignorance advertising large 6 foot tall standing fans blowing wide open around store 80% customers employees walk around masks on. always overestimate intelligence website.

Black brown community = 80%?

If you’re 50% black brown community you’d SKIPPED charity. next mask vs mask argument vaccine vs don’t get vaccine. I’m sure marking way tell got didn’t. 

I yet hear anyone willingly want get covid-19 vaccine. 

I’m wearing mask public stay indoors otherwise 
14 days quarantine wear mask go jail get vaccine die. 

We’re indoctrinated get vaccine hurt/punish don’t. getting pretty intense That's point was. correcting user meant social policy, socialism. trolling? check history. stated race's attack white people Caucasian males multiple times. many years. personally feel like lot hate comes high risk schooling took they, never reached aspirations wanted. see one much younger(24) making lot more. sell insurance Drive Uber eats. going right now. Together stand divided fall. taking Vaccines brought ""White Rural America"" Same. show what's happens smokers. People watch ads cigarette hand no.  help combat-spread Swedens ruling system awful handling crisis actually. country peace long doesnt know handle things going bad.

As example bad is, Swedens goverment litterally cant start state emergency. someone started war Sweden would likley week long debate do. Swedish governing system sluggish.

Idk party would even done differently. wouldnt easy either. party tried stong meassures would likley gotten extreme amount backlash.

Edit: Give reddit gold money people need dont waste shitty ass website. Lol even Fauci thinks open. Costs keeping kids @ home worse still yet hear alternatives. field hospitals didn’t work, hospitals max capacity. federal government dropped ball. else could done? case whites likely negatively effected covid someone donated money available whites would go well. all. Classmate mine several times, name perfect attendance every year school. understand perfect attendance award, basically solid confirmation spread least one disease school year.    yet Texas hosting nascar race today allowing ticket sales 50% capacity... 67,500 people. Unbelievable. dictatorship inherently imperfect Yeah, that's countries outside America though. America rather unique way companies interacting government. Lol dafuq, hears stupid pun played ""teen between"" thinks, ""someone fucking kids""?!

Why head goes?! Fuck man, think says lot western culture lol. No. West ""trajectory"" 90s, early 2000s. 2008 2014 Ukrainian coups anti-russian nature. Let's forget Olympic War Georgia instantly pinned Russia. Baltic counties increasingly russophobic since early 2000s (all USA nato support). Terrorists murderers Chechnya running Russia got political asylum EU - discover many years later indeed terrorists murderers.

2014 open declaration war honestly Putin crew hopelessly delusional attempts restore status quo, whole thing could gone much better much less victims - could repeated Olympic War situation.

Everything else piling Cold War 2.0 rethoric. Like Syria war sanctions? fucking place begin with, waging proxy war got defeated decided fabricate bunch bullshit. Election meddling, give break, controlled government 90s rigged elections puppet. openly fund opposition disinformation campaign every occasion. that's something unthinkable imply is, we'll nuclear war now. mention still zero actual proof anything besides secret reports US ""Iraq Wmds"" intellegence.

Not mention ""sanctions"" fact economical terrorism sanctions ""annexation Crimea"" allegedly ""referendum gunpoint"" targeting ""at gunpoint"" Crimea citizens, allegedly victims aggressive occupation. west sponsors misinformation campaigns trying portrait situation dire apparently make people what? Rise military? Get killed? Try break away join back Ukraine way worse situation? Like what's point?

There point, spending money fuck people hope generate topics used broad internal pro-western propaganda. Fucking people lives increase [party] reelection chances. hey, sure, blame that.

While west exists, peace Earth kids disabilities need therapy? Kids grades pre-k 8th grade? Kods internet computer? Kids terrible home lives school better option? 

They cant sit front computer 8 hours day lucky get 30 mins say 3rd grade lucky hour two beyond that. 

Also parents 100% need kids whole time. kid going sit pay attention without supervision.

What solution this? Abandon education year? hear impractical complaining solutions.

How schools pay substantial amount software hardware need provide tax dollars everywhere fraction normally are?

and next year? substantial amount students going meet requirements advance next grade level. schools going 1/2 class know need know one went school remote learning joke? ripple effect huge.

What's solutions? Oh definitely. teacher get ill pass away years ago, last class know graduating last year. happened 9th grade year still talked graduated. “Americans rise times crisis. Let’s see together.”

Seems like spreadin virus y’all great together. read that? I'm gonna assume downvotes annoyed advertising want discourage people making masks. also super strict keeping everyone besides state besides ""safe"" areas New England. looking go vacation, even less .1% active covid cases per million, makes live red zone according VT. think we're pretty good here. argument kids milder symptoms benefits education outweigh risk opening. Engineers China average make bankers. ""Nobody put final dates... things might go wrong reality working big pharma company, vaccine could fairly widely available around September sort target working on,"" David Carpenter said.  Thank sharing experience! actually reading recent Google reviews last night trying get sense whether people felt handling social distancing well. One person said enforced all, everyone else seemed think handling safety well. I'm gonna think bit more...have stuff get done next days first anyway. mean emphysema? Endometriosis typically uterus... Let Karma deal him, family/relatives people possibly him. One problem know companies organizations never hire enough staff able staff stay home regularly prevent spread illness without seriously screwing staff business organization. 

It's hard call sick knowing others, often individuals fact, job you. I've essential asked doctors, thanks news, they've said elderly responded badly intensive care different care preferred humane reasons. logical go non-Swedish doctor since established counts intensive care differs countries, reason even peer reviewed articles subject become highly irrelevant they're elderly Corona respond Sweden's intensive care. peer reviewed article, I'd happily read it, best information subject seems come Swedish doctors, whose experience *the elderly responded badly intensive care different care preferred humane reasons*. Welding two weeks way better endless case rising. Yet 😏. Sadly level “knowledge” common comes Internet digital ads. People legitimately 0 idea they’re talking about. comment absolutely absurd. Anything economy! Even sacrifice million kids. 🙄 Hopefully anti-science crew pipes get pandemic control time fun year end activities like prom graduation! navy going do? People.need wear masks, self isolate, social distance close public places. probably get worse first student teacher dies. missreading it. negatives counted multiple times day, rather negatives day day removed population get positive test. number subtracting total people per day, total tests per day.

For example. say auditorium 100 people. Day 1 test 50 people get 10 positive. Day 2 test everyone, get 14 positive (yesterday's 10 positive 9 positive, 1 negative). think day 2 reported?

It sounds like would expect report 14%, report total test results DOH State Report (today 99k neg, 16k pos, 14.26%).

But number useful want know fast spreads number skewed retests people already know tracked active cases.

What Florida does, subtracts 10 people tested positive yesterday, 40 tested negative. 40 testing positive today important 50 untested. two populations 10 people know it, 90 people know. Florida would report day 2 number 5 new positive 90 = 5.5%.

Your number subtracting everyone previously tested negative would report 5/50=10%. what's worse everyone tested negative, tomorrows testing would denominator 0 subtract everyone it. fewer people never tested, number exceed 100%. Oh know run 240hz, matter input's locked 60!

No seriously though, plasma accepts higher input?  behind paywall, post content? Good idea. vectors transmission. 

/s one said couldn't. absolutely agree statement. racist good look though reports? No, he's not. Getting 20k cases would require doubling testing capacity. run like 100k tests, likely get 10k positive ones. usually also test people likely covid19. (I mean need test governor's staff regularly, governor catch it, ...). Presymptomatic Trump's favorability rating among Republicans still high 70%s.

If still identifying Republican complicit OK party doing. want hear bullshit excuses.

#~~Republicans~~ want dead. Odd. people airplanes fly still alive. people registering race tracks fine. Etc etc.

I asthma, take precautions, far good. Allahu ackbar. side effect parents whose job wants reopen won’t able go work kids home vs school. 

Hopefully voters start understand potential benefit subsidized childcare 

Turns sometimes shit happens circumstances like make really hard find childcare prohibitively expensive Yeah, thing I've trying tell people near me. Summer here. Viruses suck multiplying hot weather. 4 million cases summer slow looks like us... anybody think coronavirus treats age groups differently? That’s silly. “These fresh raw lungs 10 years old going infect them.” says coronavirus. course government perfect. 

The US used asbestos 40 years much rest world banned it. lost family members mesothelioma government wouldn’t ban even though everyone knew caused disease death.  Hopefully deep correct deep scream people incomprehendibly selfish stupid Agreed. think additionally productive suggest videos debunk shitty theories alongside conspiracy theory videos. EVERYTHING Trump admin involve military? I've heard one times too. Super frustrating.

I taken sarcastically responding ""yeah, China, Japan, Europe, Russia, Iran, even Sinaloa Cartel, everyone got together play little joke."" Everyone sees issue. 

The problem kids go school, many parents can't go work. parents can't go work, corporate overlords keep making money fantastic velocity they've come expect.

So worth condemn kids die keep cogs machine well oiled. Winter? What's that? stopped real winters almost decade ago Austin. generally hibernate deep summer instead. faux winter time become active spend time outdoors. worry, heat spreading north, give 20 years know mean. 

I spent early morning cutting fallen tree 90 degree 85% humidity, that's pleasant weeks. Here's deal. leave house protest. Just stay home work. It's safer week oligarchs get message.

I've already forgotten **Trump OK Putin killing American soldiers.** you? 1% death rate, 70% infection rate, advocating 2.45 million deaths. 30% 70% loses immunity, looking 49% immune, 70%. No, special plastics get hot. wood.

They stay away metal cheap plastics new playgrounds. always easy finding another job. single kids help money situation either. 2 incomes maintaining status quo living means essential. 

Sounds financial literacy borne flat broke dude. One thing always floored people's food budgets much eats savings. make sound financial decisions money. worries :) thanks convo battle ships shell Texas coast, destroying coronavirus. set surpass Chile France next days.

Sweden took fewer precautionary measures European country, it’s surprising high.

The U.S. death count continues climb, euro countries list significantly slowed rates.

The virus started spreading us later Europe. months catch up, U.S. likely crack top 3. Vote republicans office. suck everything besides making rich rich expense poor middle class. 

The things sort known good: economy defense, suck well. 9/11 happened Bush’s watch Osama wasn’t killed Obama’s turn. economy better democrats. Even trump literally said so. Hey let's give NH credit too. longer month. People wearing masks living life usual. still little league baseball tournaments going every weekend. People idiots. scare communism looking attainable world goes shit? 

“But muh state capitalism”. communists continue organizing watch world burn. Vermont 2nd lowest population, little higher Wyoming. entire state less population city Boston. Sorry, no-one going bother work you. actually argue case. look ignorant posting links ability explain. gets back track worth following IMO lol watching lady fall front cruiser 10/10  emergency work city older woman working mask, shield. kept trying stay away kept coming close me. city even offered mask declined send home. Ridiculous!!! thought discussion trump racist, supporters? Check givens assumptions making logical argument, please? recall correctly, reason vaccine coming quickly modified SARS/MERS vaccine developed years ago. proven safe already. likely effective vaccines tailored perfectly covid, save lives.
Edit: mostly correct. (Had wrong previous virus, correct based previous vaccine.) country can’t even figure stop kids literally bringing guns school shooting classmates, totally rely students’ collective sense empathy social responsibility student individually take upon mitigate health risks posed others. 
/s sick shit SARS (hospital), sick right shit blew up... test tell I've it? 3 month old live for. Don’t go bad time travel. American. every country I've people think country best world. That's people are. Get it. Shit..... keep seeing groups middle schoolers walking street. Like damn parents dumb fuck. Seriously every one kids potential spread every family ... Haha true.   Take huge grain salt. Germany cases thankfully low Saxony even fewer cases states Germany[1]. counties Dresden, Bautzen Goerlitz mentioned article total &lt;1500 confirmed cases since start pandemic.

So absolutely cannot compare regions things less control here.

[1] Yeah are, life returned normal Spanish flu much devastating There's good bad sides. Cares- Bush, Obama. fucks given - Clinton, Trump.

Edit: accidentally put Obama categories, meant trump people outside sub already back normal make hot play on? fuckin cool. Really? feel you.

Your right cocktail crowded bar trump right live.

If known positive COVID, refuse isolate.. would okay punishment death penalty. Failing isolate known positive literally killing people.

An eye eye. I'm sure Republicans would stand behind that. This... semblance sort control right Let's infect military. Putin really win. death rate may low young dudes better believe bad job while...  Reinfected even possible? Ignorance bliss one people downvoted, frustrating obvious sheer number cases virus airborne capacity.


That said, there's still cases people getting positive results negative covid tests obviously outliers.

That's say immunity may may fade eventually, really think assume since outbreaks go back far October, there's still big flux people getting twice ... safe say get least 6 8 months immunity. wish luck phobia. muscle injection like flu vaccine is, shaping be, it'll quick painful. like needles either. give blood I've gotten plenty blood draws yearly health checkups. like *at all*. still need do. blood donations help others. blood draws tests help me. Know there's plenty people world profoundly uncomfortable needles reason.

Also careful replied to, downright anti-vaxx sentiment implying we'll ""marked"" biblical mark beast. conspiracy talk. Well world invalidated every piece evidence guess really anything left create little reality. fine surprised nobody takes seriously. story actually accurate. Arizona past peak. 

Your post interesting think highlights main flaw humans. 

You see accurate information propaganda people know truth, fear may act recklessly, true. may. doesn’t make truth propaganda. 

What you’re calling (ignoring truth order get people “do right thing”) actually propaganda. 

And sad part even good intentions negative outcomes. propaganda makes people distrust anything virus. propaganda want run make people “do right thing” it’s visibly wrong person taking ten seconds research see that. 

And see that, they’ll completely disbelieve anything virus, blame them? caught purposely lying them.... articles intended boost stock market. Every time another one comes DOW goes up. Dont pin hopes bc pan mental health take hit. End story. even get one SARS till issue anymore. people know either set tools, want use all. doomers sub always lap negative headlines often completely speculative designed read like fear porn, absolutely refuse accept good news treatments/vaccines like this?

Do people want live lockdown/misery forever impose everyone else or?... saying population people overwhelmingly support progressive candidates also believes science takes simple precautions protect other?

What surprise beat virus. someone lives Missouri agree. hell comes vacations??? reason vacation drive lake ozarks it’s convenient sure anyone would come state! said that, talking Europe less finished first wave. Even worst affected countries seeing three digit infections two digit deaths.

The US months behind even peaked yet. Thats right know what? think know can. know get stabbed back, try solve soften problem Administration made extrem worse could be, risk life, left Familie know this. what? safe lives. 

Sorry bad english maybe get point. Fuck Trump guys good. Uh wtf even talking this. 

Is sky blue?

Do birds fly?

Are reading this?

#Idiocracy moooooom, boys fighting need believe everything God deserved. God strikes virus deserved it. say “like say, I’m pro-vaxx” right repeat anti-vaccine talking points often, might want reconsider actually pro. Lakh common Indian Unit million used rarely India. president isn’t dictator US states rights means president cannot order decree local school system does. Also every state different shouldn’t treated same. 

If issue covid handled local school system direct criticism directly Governor, mayor school board. Blaming president even congress local issues shows complete ignorance government works. honestly debate though? conservatives engage good-faith discussions? scream ""Reopen"" 

Cause thats impression get conservatives. easy playbook them, argue anything repeat point ad nausem. Gun Control? SECOND AMENDMENT. FREEDUM. Global Warming? HAPPENING. Racism America? IMPOSSIBLE. 

Conservatives argue, get smug make argue. work? already teacher shortages? http://www.iberchina.org/files/13-five-year-plan.pdf

Knock out, questions I’m happy answer them.

Of course seem like Bourgeois fuck don’t expect reply good faith. 

I’ll busy organizing masses. could retake tests sick, that’s true. try get take soon got back though often lunch break. essays regular assignments often things still required complete time, although teachers would push back deadlines wrote nice email, sometimes easier go class learn needed learn complete assignments able ask questions. 

Then attendance policies. Typically penalized one 2 unexcused absences 3-5 absences cause. Since kid always sick sometimes problem me. school also required doctor’s note count excused absence, parent’s word, sometimes hard get parents work.

I loved many teachers, never felt like bent backwards help us sick even really encouraged us stay home get others sick. went private school strong work culture though. Come think never problems public elementary school stayed home often that, including 2 whole weeks fifth grade difficult case flu. appreciate efforts try get kids right thing, I’m sure helps even doesn’t seem like it. still u show respect. U r ignoring question: lockdown every year ? cause hundreds thousands casualties worldwide hunger, stress despair worth it.

There zero proof single death caused measures. comparing theoretical deaths recorded deaths proved caused COVID-19. really hope really can’t live like longer. extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts pandemic know I’m one huge decline mental health.

Fingers crossed works out. punch face? admire restraint. weeks, gather family funerals.
Taking number friends losing parents, grandparents. That's highly doubtful reality relying upon mathematical guess policy would still lead even devastating impacts infections anti-response seen throughout Oh mean exactly like New York? Season 1 fire, lost interest start 2 Yeah unemployment approved 166 week taxes well. get paid 14$ hour 38 hours week. add up, considering I'm unpaid medical leave I'm extremely high risk, extension happen ill screwed. process takes years often enough people clinical trials.    case pandemic. say symptoms again. saw SK non-infectious dead virus particles linger. know COVID sheds long time. understand well enough explain support fantasy communist Chinese economy. Good know.  source, doubting you. Would like able share. could show Vietnam deaths againand happened today Republicans would fine it. Leave Fox News: research team politicizing issue? lost morally country. man legally carrying gun means he’s allowed assault asthmatic old ladies trying get leave store we’re living overwrought comic book dystopia.

*someone needs stand justice* Yeah well.. highly contagious virus rippling across earth. Gonna like while. Write new story never going back normal maybe countries like Italy, beginning outbreak, less understanding virus got overwhelmed early stages Thank sharing experience, perhaps give someone taking seriously reconsider decisions go social distance wear mask. like Texas Florida success boasting months ago crashing burning. tragic is. 

Still can't believe locked down. state wide mask order Texas. even many people throwing shit fit them. Near Burlington 16 inches snow schools closed day, roads cleared. wasn’t lying said that. literally doesn’t second guess things. Probably shouldn’t power.  Ah, see now. formed opinion you. impression call ER ahead going covid symptoms anyway. can't open site 'it available European countries'. Would like share contents? Also, cannot believe would change suggested. Although Holland small country, 17,500,000 people crammed together one small place averages probabilities quite well presume. 1 vaccine succeed, well, rollout worldwide level much easier, several already preparing mass produce.

Pfizer Moderna's probably interesting watch similar, phase 1 results also similar. one works, likely works (note: Pfizer multiple production slight variations see effective, also interesting approach). would huge production worked. That's awesome. Somebody give trophy something. ...but call it? Hey, Im actually high school right now, feel thankful school gave us survey choosing want deal school, first option stay home online school, second option two days physical school, three home, last full school days. Mainly survey personalized student, could choose stay home that's I'm going deal school year someone else stay school. I'm unsure high schools, least spend last year high school risking life.  news?  known entire duration pandemic virus spreads amongst groups same. difference risk worse symptoms age infected vary. Thanks that, hadn’t come across info yet. Although I’d still find hard believe didn’t start directly wet market trade, whether actual wet market question neighbor said knows nurse says way overblown hospitals getting paid $40,000 covid-positive death. argue can't argue stupid think paying that? insurance company gets pissy want referral dermatology I'm 900% sure insurance companies shelling $5.6 billion ""fake deaths"" ($40,000x 140,000 deaths). 

My neighbor narcissistic ever asked living, would know ICU (rhymes purse can't say else automod delete this) 1) nurses idea hospitals get reimbursed deal care, billing 2) covid horrible way die call hoax makes callous unempathetic. Herd immunity isn’t people naturally becoming immune... vaccines work eliminate viruses precisely cause herd immunity. 

So yeah, dream still herd immunity. That’s literally vaccines dude. 🤦🏻‍♂️  leaders trying hammer huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan unscheduled third day testy summit Brussels.**  Arizona reported highest death count state Saturday since pandemic began, according Covid Tracking Project data Johns Hopkins University.

A total 147 deaths reported July 18, data shows.

The previous one day record 117 deaths July 7, according Covid Tracking Project.

The positivity rate also remains high blistering 39.04% July 18, according Arizona State University Biodesign Institute. current 7 day average positivity rate 24.24%. Doomscrolling equals checking r/Coronavirus every waking hour. like I'm right now. Ugggghh. I'll admit times beginning, I'm used wearing mask scarf around face skating biking winter keep warm/prevent chapped lips... times habit, like Jesus Christ need stop hahaha

Anyone months shit straight-up jackass too. family much stronger after/while going this. turns love kids, actually like them. can’t imagine much sucks discovered didn’t really like with. planning teaching abroad 2 years stuff lines up, realize urgency would ramp like this. 

As leaving field, I'm sure else would point skills would transfer another field. close friend considering divorce husband isn’t wearing masks, parties, invites people constantly. three young kids doesn’t care. thinks it’s flu. I've defended everything I've needed to. incapable seeing that. great day!!  Yes, make valid point. you. feeling many others upvoting downvoting seem think disagree matter. showing different kinds results similar studies, although indeed different regions world. say US open up, I'm say Amerika adopt Dutch strategies. Like pointed out, may work different region. conclude stuff complicated, things may counter intuitive, order learn solely read RIVM CDC suppose. first though ""September? They'll probably vaccinate whole NFL thinking great PR one misses game."" Yeah, definitely happen US, too. disappointing see relatively simple rule followed. One event lots people moving around, wearing masks, probably short time periods area. question would nebulous would hard nail specifics. 

The specific place, people wearing masks staying stationary long periods time. forgot podcasts...yep started found new game ""merge dragons"" lol Im sure another country, somwhere states, read somewhere place going closing high schools distance learn, using empty high schools space pre k couple grades up. think thought process teenagers better equipped physically mentally study home help mom dad, toddlers really need continue face face interaction, toddlers really needs right now. definitely agree train thought, yes ideal teenagers either, little ones start behavioral social problems long dont prioritize them. So, I've seething lately COVID misinformation allowed spread youtube social media platforms.

For know, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, many social media platforms put kind COVID misinformation policy. say content undermines efforts medical organizations worldwide, regionally, locally regarding symptoms, treatment, diagnosis, transmission allowed.

I reported numerous videos violating policy. yet, seen even one get taken down.

Take prolific nutjob 120,000+ every video makes violates four. believes whole thing hoax, perpetrated Bill Gates NWO, statistics fake, everything actually normal flu, vaccine, one gets produced, designed government mind control/population control. Also, everyone wears mask nazi Bill Gates' payroll (I believe I'm owed wages then).

His idiot minions bombarding nearly every mainstream COVID related news story youtube misinformation.

To add insult injury, videos indeed get taken down... got put back youtube. Why? knows? clearly violation policy.

Meanwhile, platforms, BBC reported flagging 649 different posts Facebook Twitter violated respective policies spreading COVID/5G conspiracy theories. 90% never taken warnings point establishing policy going let idiots like piss well public health regardless?

If want end stupidity people think right divest reality run around like guerilla army Typhoid Marys, need de-platform them. protected speech. equivalent yelling fire crowded theater. Furthermore, private platform, even protected constitution (which isn't) need allowed youtube.

Telling people ignore legal orders take precautions stop spread virus encouraging illegal activity. also puts lives risk.

What stop this? make companies like google listen least enforce EXISTING POLICIES?

At point I'm pretty sure social media big threat COVID, politics, COVID, life general would anywhere near toxic shut down. People != people irl. good bad ways way go blue cyanosis...which way.  sources this? Howdy folks I’m governor Mississippi care bowing God Emperor Donald Trump safety well-being citizens state global pandemic yes  Phase 4 studies long term effects. given rarity, usually get discovered millions vaccinated. first point, think likely see opposite. ""Well, wear mask/wait go Disney/avoid bar couple months, could that.""  

Your second point pretty much likely happen without added pressure since inherent pressure. think adds significant pressure them.

Your final point pretty much conjecture think true. Again, opposite that's likely happen anti-vaxers would use vaccines ""appeared nowhere"" ""vaccine cancelled unsafe"". human spread fucking virus!!! That’s answer right there! wearing mask shouldn’t political disregard virus gets even less emphatic time . really give fuck. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).*  Even 12% already high lockdown required. true number makes necessary. There’s chart that’s circulating around every often that. believe it’s pretty high first couple days false negative. Especially since time develop symptoms exposure usually 2+ days. would call doctor express concern it, would likely tell it’s best get tested. Sure, also 143000 dead. ""all lives matter"" never muttered words succession. I'm saying everyone needs help providing certain skin color wrong. agree, need work yourself. totally agree! many friends want schools open restrictions. convinced parents longer send sick kids school. think even true, many contagious kids school whose parents unaware. Spray water everyone! love fear monger stories solution ads. Mine get awfully foggy, I'm breathing heavily. (I try shaving cream trick, helps bit.) happen tips work you?  get full compliance stated rules, don’t see problem open restrictions. main concern would well enforcing compliance. Wait second... thought lack preparation Obama!

Thanks Obama!

Edit: didn’t read article, it’s Israel. wear Jim Jones shades already! crazy coming government, pure cult insanity. though case clearly even related disease

Clearly? conclude ""*clearly*"" unrelated? Stay strong! constant ""limbo"" personally can't stand ... Teaching hard profession find job for, work tenure. teachers tenure boycott. I'm nurse boycott picketed much pandemic get supplies need better pay. read one quarantine confession, can't remember where, said ""Oh god! teachers school picking child. He/She actually fucking brat disruptive, listen, lies time.""  Duh, humans too. thought good country, seems corrupt. glad live US get then, I'm expecting prioritized waves, common folks high exposure high risk groups getting Spring. Which, I'm fine this. I’m hoping die get real choices Neither Japan, Taiwan South Korea used anything like measures you’re criticizing people US following. There’s “lockdown fatigue” Taiwan never lockdown. relied testing contact tracing. focus anger CDC fucking testIng contaminated reagents February maybe chance corral thing. FDA slow-walking EUAs private testing, shutting Seattle Flu Study consents - where’s testing robot South Korea using? Fauci Adams denouncing masks kind - even cloth homemade - early April. course Trump also states - Massachusetts seems competently handled contact tracing, state responsibility least since polio.

Yeah, idiots there. always - even 100% perfect infection control program.  don’t. what’s harmful? 12 dumb college kids holding Covid party Alabama, *every single test US* first month outbreak come back positive test permitted contaminated manufacturer? I’ve wearing mask since February, honestly think ought fix shit lecture going restaurant, etc. Welcome hotel california :) Agree. NY didnt well.

This thing politicized either way. That's experience. turns friends.

Well, say diamonds girl's best friend, diamonds cold, hard, dead things dogs floppy ears waggy tails little pink tongues maybe I'd rather man, lol.

Casual acquaintances random positive interactions fellow redditors also nice huge improvement faux friends. premature talk.

I think vaccine released going see interesting behavior.

I think corporations going outbid vaccines give workforces get back profitability a.s.a.p. biggest earners get vaccine first bring company value. India agreed big deal Oxford provide many developing countries. Oxford said since beginning priority give countries need need most, rich.  seems long term effects Covid19 ""sniffles"" scientifically unknown. DJT minimizes dangerous pandemic words make sense. always really interesting me, throughout life I've run *soooo* many religious engineers scientists.

 started college going biomedical engineering transferring different school get degree biology, yeah tons religious engineering students many religious bio/chem/physics majors.

 think base mindset, questioning discovering vs told rules building based them? Armchair psychologist haha something interesting I've noticed, yeah mean regardless religious faith, engineers scientists usually always put science first  1. combination honestly perfect. can't really pharmacology (in modern sense) without bioinformatics. ability use computational methods identify genes interest targeted novel therapeutic techniques amazing. use bioinformatics vary depending project work though. example, previous lab rotating using molecular dynamics simulations determine whether ligand could dock protein. want bother going months experiments determine even possible. simulations allowed us determine likely dock could go ahead validate trying get crystal structure two together. 
2. end staying lab, though, since computational based wanted. Instead, joined lab looks gut microbiome genetic makeup individual influence progression diseases (especially Type 2 Diabetes). construct correlation networks genes, microbes, phenotypes host. Then, write scripts analyze huge networks isolate individual genes microbiota targeted. relay information wet lab side lab essentially say ""target gene let know response is."" lucky something like inhibiting gene prevent progression disease, know gene crucial could target medication future. requires good knowledge R Python. Since interested bioinformatics, assume probably know decent amount either R Python, definitely want get familiar them!

Let know questions. happy answer have! spending lots time together inside, really get know someone. many, discover piece shit partner actually is. Precisely. one arguing otherwise... you’re literally “all lives matter”-ing someone donating money demographic dire need help... Oh way young giving away location age reddit. delete post history. numbers graph simpleton. know graph is? true, 140000 dead Americans would make absolutely golden opportunity satirical TV series. 

You've got sane one (Fauci) influence administration, utterly incompetent, narcissist boss, incompetent number 2, attack dogs/young guns absolutely empathy compassion, cast governors. me, major thing even safe. School place could get guaranteed meal free breakfast/lunch. Part reason get angry people want get rid programs. Like, whenever school starts back up, I'd show up, bruised skinny shit. feel 1000% awful kids right now. school went online canceled March, already reading students basically disappeared. Probably seen again. who's going care them? THANK everything kids, I'm sorry country supporting this, truly hero. Germany rightfully getting lot praise 200k official cases 9.1k deaths.

Our main surge started February. California surge start June. catch us, easily. Finally man sense, hopefully shut getting hand identify lol...""refreshing reddit"" lol not, getting shared twitter links husband lol...I never youtube started watching pandemic...then gardening &amp; bike rides &amp; new recipes...a puzzles colder weather. Hang there!!! Quebec absolute shit, 66deaths / 100k , take advice combating corona there. reference Florida 23 / 100k. Thank you. Dumbing humor crap. Uh oh. Soccer practice tonight. still haven’t received unemployment claim month ago. mean? NY's rich assholes fled Hamptons. figured Cali's would hiding Palm Springs. first numbers picked. There’s lots ways hypothesize general loss immunity one-year time scale, reports reinfection still rare point. say believe loss immunity real likely, currently statistically possible rule out.  Literally inject veins. want first person world get this. we're lied much we're trusting good news. think specific reaction due Hispanic community mostly Democrat, rich Hispanic guy goes &amp; says wonderful guy strongly dislike is. reacting betrayal someone supposed part community share values. 

Bill Gates isn’t part community, don’t see response happening. LabCorp antibody testing $99 without insurance. believe $10 $20 insurance. LabCorp nationwide. shitty take. shitty person.

It's clear can't defend stance deflecting. Bye. I'm sure certain Swede soon try counter article feel-good article two older swedish ladies knitting session Zoom.

To create *balance*. realize clicks = advertising money?

You realize fearmongering = clicks?

""Nobody panics things go ""according plan."" Even plan horrifying! If, tomorrow, tell press that, like, gang banger get shot, truckload soldiers blown up, nobody panics ""part plan"". say one little old mayor die, well everyone loses minds."" Christopher Nolan, Dark Knight.

An article old guy dying COVID would get almost clicks, news. article young guy dying COVID? Clickbait = Money money money. long exposure take actually test positive? I’m concerned person close contact yesterday take test tomorrow would even show correct result  worst Ive heard businesses people trying get fired right hired, people dont understand cannot get unemployment firing due cause. going reduce $0. Yeah, one ever thought otherwise. Fitrst I'm course random redditor, asked random redittors opinion thats get.


The air airplane actually filtered circulates. probably risk contracting passengers sitting direct vicinity, well people cross airport itself. friends sit next plane minimize risk. get higher-quality masks (n95, ffp2) whole group specifically flight (and airport) probably good idea. Also carry hand sanitizer.

At location, avoid contact people friends travel with, seem plan do.

When back, assume contracted stay away people, especially risk.

If everyone group able stick precautions, opinion, risk within acceptable limits.

But thats me, course.

Edit: respiratory virus transmission airplanes: http://news.emory.edu/stories/2018/03/airline_disease_transmission_study/ Cute. professorial you. That's misinformation gets circulated, sad part facts contradict believe ignore it. ....But seems proffered conclusion children.  Well Phase 3 trial complete around 12 months starts however emergency approval granted vaccine proves safety efficacy.

According Oxford, able prove efficacy around 40 people trial test positive see many 40 placebo group - lets say 30+ placebo group, suggests vaccine effective emergency approval follow. Breaking News: Coronavirus found seamen !! ??? I’m saying answers blame seriously, deaths inevitable. patients weren’t d/c back NH would even preventable deaths people ERs, medical floors ICUs. still don’t see good resolution. Maybe Trump steadfast initiating action warned countries didn’t take hand approach would turned better. Cuomo acting pressure hospitals themselves, acting independently. working pandemic, went 2-3 patients floor, days later half floor, days later whole floor everyone room themselves, next week entire floor everyone roommates patients dropped hallway ER overflowing people dying left right. There’s literally good solution I’m getting at.



Nursing homes going get slammed regardless fucking shit hell manage get name?! idea, thank you. I'll check that. cloth masks order arrive tomorrow always double up, right? I'd get lot weird looks protect others! Oddly enough, I've actually become optimist since start this. I've realized took granted want let go waste future. That's I've gotten this. definitely miss pandemic I'm vaccinated. Here's Californias' latest case/death charts, running 7-day looking good. Yeah. Like Scream Edvard Munch. look terms later. Interesting stuff become knowledgeable on. Anecdote: Live Upstate SC. exposure kid next door tested positive. drive-up self-service test local CVS (which challenging get scheduled). Still waiting result 12-days... cases. Yes. Thanks that. I'm still hearing bunch us he's great... course not. would make sense. Maybe sharpee Atlantic we're safe. I've saying along. Show uncensored videos people dying streets covid well videos overflowing bodies hospitals (there database tin videos bunch different countries..... play loop 24 7... make.people wake fuck up) stand said. would literally miracle lol *the local sheriff went Facebook said wasn’t going enforce state requirement*

So enforce it, feels need tell everyone going enforce it. would guess first time sheriff chosen laws enforce enforce on. Maybe South Korea's using crappy tests. whole ""covid-19 reinfection"" later explained away false positives. surprised study well. Would able spread period fighting off? old fashion culling /s Next manufacturing, logistics, distribution.  ""I asking, wear mask stay fuck away me""  I'm trying understand. lack compassion feature, bug? dont judge people political opinions stance virus all. friends life left, friends right wing... everything, never care it, decent people. long talking literal nazis extremes like that, dont care stance politics, covid matter.

There always decent people well assholes sides, conservative, socialist pro/contra mascs, social distancing etc say much persons integrity. Would able spread still? You’re right, they’ll spend rent ramen. unemployment type disposable income need get economy moving again. vaccine 100% effective. vaccines take decades tweaking improving 85-95% effective best. vaccine given rapid timeline likely nowhere close that. We're probably looking 60-70% effectiveness would guess. account people take like anti vaxxers people believe rushed, let's say 70% get immunized, 0.7 x 0.7 = 0.49 therefore best case scenario 49% population immunity end day. nonprofit deal indian company produce billion developing nations covid goes away, people continue get sick diseases. Common cold included. allowed wear mask prevent spread would help ease mind bit. girlfriend works summers child carer, works school one room alongside 1-2 others, taking care 5-20 kids, live Iowa, everyone knows governor didn’t anything enforce nothing beginning this, isn’t anything now, opened back schools zoom call teachers officials, wasn’t safe meet person, yet balls open schools day cares, well back story, gf goes back taking care kids, first days 2-4 kids it’s full class, max 20 kids. day. week. said kids coughing sneezing touching kids like game, wtf wrong iowans!?!? Wtf governor nothing fear fear itself....and coronavirus deaths guess. Duh.

This like sort test see much inanity people buy apparently that's pandemic. control America would need like 10000 deaths day supposedly Tying hundreds billions subsidies renewal adherence core philosophies EU worth stalling over.

Handing Oban polish buddy free money without stipulations won’t help citizens. 4 months late! USA! posts comment history UPS subreddit seems pretty legit. 

Or he's really playing long game. Real talk though: Track trace nigh useless current numbers. ER physician working pandemic. husband Constitutional law attorney. mostly agree disagree terms quarantine, masks protests. sometimes go it. Honestly think he's deep denial. proudly boasted fake long died triples down. pathetic sad. disagree. hasn’t studied. authors aware Swiss outbreak. Considering we're still arguing masks, majority change behavior. might though. I've definitely learned lot throughout whole thing. (i.e. people gross.) Maybe could help us live?  Shut down, second third shutdown small businesses left. worth it. places closed construction, hot people using masks makes uncomfortable heatstrokes (we ambulances called past week 6 months 2019).
Some pools allowed X amount guests line sun waiting people leave pool many chill chair hours maybe don’t get enjoy pool waiting day line get in. buffets restaurants (which changing due bad reviews since opened) charging 45 dollars plate can’t stand get food casts allowed get food character restaurants main reason people visit specific ones.

There things moment dealt with.  hope survive 4 months.  Apart community effort needed wear mask much possible practice social distancing, think we're handling perfectly. people wanting wear masks people attending big illegal parties. think one thing saving us strict lockdown lasted months, reopening postponed less 500-600 daily cases, allowed easier contact tracing.

So there's really way masks + social distancing + lockdown + testing tracing... Wish guys well! dont know long last virus, particular vaccine supposedly produces cells well stick around defending years true would amazing! Instead saying doctors nurses start saying healthcare workers? know implied, technologist sees patients COVID everyday honestly feel like vast majority healthcare employees disregarded frontline. 

💯💯💯 enough people stop spending money entirely. damages brain organs

I'd love nothing know long term effects, know them. Stop pouring imagination onto You’d rather one day mild sickness

same above, fastest vaccine ever like 5x margin know shit side effects regardless anyone ever claim Would hypertension account high resting heart rate? Yea, treated MANY people 3 negative tests (ie. purely clinical suspicion alone) hypoxic classic CT chest findings. many things cause SOB, know diagnose rule vast majority quite quickly days...

And I'm glad did, many ones treated ""empirically"" ended positive 4th 5th test. gonna let gorillas know you’re toughest gorilla you’re wearing mask? miss too. But, He's still here, looking us. He'd surely inspired current mess we're in. He'd definitely great new material it. understand aggressive responses you, appreciate able change mind. Seems many Trump bubble anything rationalize decision vote him. son’s 3 year old well child check supposed January, feel like may happen scheduled, depending things gonna look like. confounds story. seems tested once? got tested exposed, given three types couple days make sure results reliable everybody *else* strikes/stops buying anything teachers exposed unsafe working conditions still hits corporations wallet. hope highest hopes. Oxford please bail US even though deserve it, many appalled handled anything uncivil comment? agreed heavily OP says it’s bluff. people Los Angeles would get behind full shutdown again. Lockdown, pretty easy. ???? bet 11.1% work force keeps spending money food, utilities, etc money still getting.

Spending drop considerably, stop. Ok, liar too.

It's good know I'm dealing with. Fellas I’ve scrolled far comments yw higher younger couples (under 30)? likely they'll financial stress causes arguments Oh mean people walking around stoop drinks, expect still see lot   wait seem difficult. mask, ring register. They've always right refuse service.

I guess could still walk around gardening aisle calling everyone sheeple retail workers able much. seems like waste time probably ends call police nuisance mask worn. Stupid people, stupid country. empathy. answer this?

I keep hearing people say ones getting hospitalized mostly overweight, elderly. 

Is false stereotype here? fair? link data showing trend? No. great health insurance 'good enough' others don't. Same, relationship really strengthened 2020. mean pretty well anyway pandemic really focussed priorities, opportunity spend time together safe home.

With doubt one lucky ones though. country covid control, provided financial support small business, job security, families healthy, mental health ok atm. strict budget still pay mtge. see eye eye pandemic response even though different political leanings.

For many highlighted longer want, job they've grinding away 10 years, city longer want live in, relationship run course. I've seen numerous people say stay home bring death home. I've used dish soap trick (Dawn specifically). Works well, forever. Need reapply every time go out. windshield anti-fog stuff I've meaning try, keep forgetting. Amazing pay 75% rent. Dickiness aside, seems like dumb political move. contact net 140k-and-counting people massive, many might take well death someone know dismissed sniffles. Remember people joking ""corona babies"" 9 months quarantine? Nurse here. ABSOLUTELY counts. Thanks much keep us patients safe. Infections kill. Remember. spray tan man data sent directly WHouse..... stay there, obviously meddled with, sent CDC.......... numbers fudged.... going see mysterious slow yet sure flattening curve regardless much risky behaviors getting.... numbers since days ago considered unreliable.... tyrant open schools. open economy. Children learn, parents work. sustainable. We’ve flattened curve, that’s plan was. never prevent people exposed virus, delay exposure order overload healthcare system. can’t stay closed past fall, can’t. possible die don’t open relating poverty crime. can’t get applications open position, doesn’t mean nobody wants work. means you’re offering isn’t attractive. South Africa masks compulsory public since start, tough lockdown lifted stages, numbers skyrocketing. also banned cigarettes alcahol. think simple that. know Oregon districts planning least high school stay distance learning. K-8 splitting kids two groups, one group school Monday Tuesday, another school Thursday Friday, Wednesday weekends “wipe sanitize everything” days. sure plan stay place schools don’t open Labor Day, that’s plan right now. Pure genius, sir! additional non FDA-approved, insufficiently-researched, otherwise hair-brained ideas welcome here. Ah gotcha! Thanks clarification! effectively, Phase 3 studies done, that's vaccines start getting put public? misunderstanding something? fall category? coming soon look like this:

 Vaccine Declared Safe Effective blame pandemic breakup girlfriend. mean, furloughed nothing else besides text day want house. nothing sit house stare other. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

I see easy would burn even stable relationship nothing do. Ah get saying. That's exactly they're doing. point prime minister premiers said stay inside 24/7. Yes, many things closed beginning control outbreak, people always allowed go outside long gather groups. things open group (to limit) want people cautious. cautious social gatherings, pubs bars,” never really know you’re close person might infected said messaging maintain safe social distancing frequent handwashing, wear mask get together small groups outdoors remains best way avoid infection.

So lockdown fatigue mean people become complacent things open, warning us continue stay vigilant. Pretending asleep. demonstrably false Covid killed 600,000 people. medical issues include death, aneurysm, blood clots, kidney, heart, liver lung damage, immune system storms, lungs filling fluid “recognizable” lung according pulmonary specialists. “early” reports medical professionals dealing physical repercussions. Trump lies, arguably thing honest presidency money making endeavor him, grifter Barbie, I’m Eric Con, jr. Conventional wisdom life says kids spread disease adults. Kids fuckin nasty. go birthday party chuckecheese get sick. Yeah, Christians abandoned Christ favor hyper-materialism never changed name. idea, nowhere near following example Christ U.S. local Stop &amp; Shop mask policy start store rep directing people wear mask door.

The store also backed ensuring local police officer always front lot.

The store representative sure would ask people wear mask leave. refused assume would tap glass informing officer store asking leave.

I understand stores can’t officer always front. possible downsides could outweigh pro directly preventing possible deaths thousands people, indirectly preventing spread virus, possibly preventing hundreds thousands deaths long term? seems like pretty easy choice me. could lower R0 free spamming ""don't meet friends inside, outside"" TV media 24/7. ""Masked protests"" yet see that, photos BLM protests mask wearers cops  know nothing support Trump not... work midsize company. unsung heros remote workers moment. works, one bats eye says thank you. breaks....

So thank you! Nope. right wrong personally long follow law, say something wrong wrong information causes someone commit crime -- violating lawful quarantine mask order, protected speech. explicitly encouraging people violate law thereby endanger public health? Give break. protected speech country ever.

Furthermore, social media protected precepts free speech. allowed rules regarding acceptable content.

Also, BBC rates higher factual reporting lower editorial bias vast majority media America, context free speech actually works, please see:

Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969)

The supreme court held speech protected ""directed inciting producing imminent lawless action likely incite produce action.""

There lawful orders many places take precautions including mask wearing, social distancing, etc. places violating orders misdemeanor -- crime. telling people violate orders. protected.  Joke. must not. countries never teach kids read fine! great plan. Excuse me, part comment invokes violence??? I’m TN surrounded people think I’m overreacting going bars parties.

With masks make money majority Florida flock also test vaccine country (Chile), 3k people. Recruitment testing start next month. “masks” people wearing ineffective. would wear N95 properly fitted face one several layers cotton ones made home. study shows ones people mostly wearing ineffective. Bandanas, single layer cloth, ones made tshirts single layer surgical masks gaps sides won’t stop transmission. 

The way stop would fit everybody proper N95’s. I’ve worked hospital ER 14 years. hospital N95 mask fit test put mask fit properly, stick head plastic container spray scented spray you. smell spray, it’s fitted right start over. people see wearing N95s public aren’t wearing right size gaps face. cough breath virus basically like they’re wearing mask free space airflow.  would manufacture them. pack 50 filters p100 higher rating n95. able find price getting jacked due covid. 

But could manufacture cheaper simpler n95 one. This. Apples oranges really, deads last years garbage Phish good quality years end imo. GD prime, I'd give back 150 Ph shows one summer those. Yup moron. There’s 333 million people US. simple sake say 3.3 million tested. That’s 1% population. 1% population 140,000 people died. 

So say everyone gets Covid? Multiply 140,000 100. 

Hell even say half us get tested get it. number (if trend lines remain, lower point remains) thats 7 million dead. 

Obviously numbers trends change, use raw statistical data 3 million infected 140,000 died good measure. Like said it’s different state state changing. Illinois switched past year city, definitely 30-50 range caring lot less. rarely see someone 20s ain't wearing mask they're about. mostly ""I can't breathe mask"" Karen's galavanting like there's issue. elderly always wearing masks. One 3000 people US died covid agree you. People tend think business owners rich. case all. ever use Obamacare? marginally better insurance local doctor cash visits common mostly immigrant communities.  GOOD. talk school board. Even keep kid home think teachers can’t stay home. Gotta give credit recently(ish) inaugurated governor. Dude working tail off. Openly gay too!

Sorry dude, place. want misconceptions cleared forums go educate yourself. means please continue fight local ordinances governor. fix problem.  Anyone even enters damn hospital wearing mask. don’t think that’s mistake. imagine everyone hoarded masks like toilet paper March New York breaking out. none healthcare workers ones coming country protection. still shortage PPE. best move tell people buy masks stay home.

This young person problem, people looking scapegoat media tagging along. They’re age group literally cannot find jobs outside food service retail. would blame black Latino community higher rates infection, blame young people. Nice. I’m VT.  suggest wasn’t wearing mask? suggest wearing mask unnecessary? You’re fucking idiot failed 4th grade reading comprehension. 3999 hours go, baby. reject masks willful ignorance convinced peer reviewed paper anyway. find counter opinion site called realinfonews.ru run can’t speak everywhere, I’m from, school moving completely online. know what’s great that?

You’re one conscience kids. headlines use effectively jarring literally asking lives Fauci potentially impact. gave answer. said “well never said 0”. it’s implying entire time.

Trump totally screwed terms support. Every reasonable person issue way Trump handled this. issue Trump secondary source should’ve taking advice experts. Fauci primary source lying arguably biggest talking point whole thing.

And question premised Fauci saying certain way. makes plea people hoard fabric masks effective, think would’ve become social issue. People wouldn’t wouldn’t socially acceptable. That’s think would happen. happened without extent, esp NJ. picked ""he investigated one us corruption"" reason impeach. Yeah...kids go get education people like say doctors part “deep state”.

My mind wants explode trying comprehend day he's pretty much stopped caring point; COVID-19 mere distraction something that's somehow urgent need attention. significant jump month half ago,” DeSantis said Saturday press conference St. Augustine. “So there’s bigger pool people antibody.”

DeSantis seems proud fact antibody positive rate high, many people infected.  becoming clear DeSantis objective get many people possible infected. ""herd immunity"" strategy. Whitehouse's fighting fight corona virus. That's fucking bizarre. No, question whether elderly Sweden maltreated. Sadly building strawman save articles shared limiting use oxygen respirators true 😢 No, say! possible? We're seeing days almost 1,000 deaths again, easily see 10,000 deaths 3 weeks. also thought initially sure asymptomatic people could spread virus not. figured asymptomatic people could, that's mask recommendations came out.

Could I'm misremembering too. much crazy shit year try keep track of. appreciated ❤️
My heart breaks people losing entire families right now. dark time. Yes definition opening indeed means opening. can't claim state done good job reopening reopened anything. good job staying locked down, good. reopened yet. Well, ABA breaking resistance kids, force arbitrary painful tasks, course kids treat people force like enemy. Even occasionally, things might required. You’re looking wrong way. Cancer largely unavoidable. It’s treatable caught early. good majority time someone gets cancer it’s ones fault truly personal (life time smoker getting lung cancer example). 

The difference Covid infect anyone. We’ve seen across spectrum range difficulties problems bring ages, even suspect getting seriously sick. 

The fact spreads others. It’s contagious what’s scary. 

I sit 90 year old grandma cancer room full family friends feel safe. 

We can’t Covid. enough data compare mask mandated non mandated regions sometime line. seems mask mandated east European countries slowed curve effectively without total lockdowns. data filters white house rather CDC reaching public. seems get infected lower rates based percentage population seem transmit less. parent likely know online schooling failure , Boston something like 20 percent students never even logged in, , need figure way get schools open. Like europeans gave indians blankets plague indians died greatest band time. Go r/Phish read intro guide, disappointed. Probably appropriate time say *All Lives Matter*. Please show get $1 N95 filter fits mask.  meme, consider deleting Facebook. There’s never better time focus personal mental health, good lord place terrible that. deleted mine almost three years ago quality life increased exponentially terrible place. flu season gunna imperceptible areas responded appropriately mandatory mask policies, distancing proper hygienic practices. areas exploding covid cases also going deal flu well gunna double whammy. live town race riot became impetus formation NAACP. never learned school growing up, got lots boring tours Lincoln's home. 🤣🤣🤣 ""how happen? even big deal, virus isnt bad people say is"" ""i didnt go anywhere someone tested positive it"" says guy state doesnt care push people test covid wear masks.  That's comparison I'm drawing, I'm comparing rationale masks.

If accept ""if saves single life"" rationale, logically mask order every cold flu season, even absense coronavirus agree, something would probably save least life many. sound like painting black white already someone else replied do. point accept reasoning, literally wearing masks forever. dont use condoms wear mask recommendations? would great idea. one guests be. Wouldn’t want live guilt! whistleblowers inside China said mild strain first mutated worse strain. 

The ccp ever provided samples mild strain international researchers. India revving up. overcrowding poverty China non Authoritarian control lock people homes.

Vermont also seems good masks well. need more. need choking parking lot waiting bed. real. never took “kids” include teenagers, since upper end high school definitely essentially adult bodies (lots things still developing, especially brains, plausible reasons asymptomatic pre-symptomatic kids don’t spread easily, table mid high school). think info came today applied symptomatic kids lockdown environment still unanswered questions kids symptoms numbers packed classes, usually poor airflow.

And since mentioned “children might spread much” thing handful comments (though typically sources included, went detail ages), apologize anyone took mean minors. Didn’t mean mislead all. know least posts clarified high school still option can’t remember did. think I'm making (their) point clear. right adults kids spread much. article conclude that. concludes kids spread even less adults here. absolute numbers, study relative numbers. ""Working vaccine launches today. Pandemic declared over.""

It may overly cynical put anything past anyone anymore. I’ve never wanted wrong lol. kept mindset “a vaccine guaranteed.” would LOVE wrong time. We’ll see. happens lot we’re understaffed too. Jesus. stonks go up. calls AZN .. vaccine data comes tommorow two year old used nap car, works well try get road trips weekends.  Even stopping anything, driving someplace new seeing something different really help. Go find lake drive sit stare water maybe get others close picnic. 

Hang there, pulling you. supposed  old middle aged people Masks required buses, instituted physical distancing buses, buses wiped loads. Even transportation seems safe possible. saying without risk, appear safe possible. University Alabama - “They put money pot. first person get Covid wins pot.”

Roll Tide. lots less kids going school. Maybe news constantly say young people can't get little symptoms young people would take seriously. news, water wet fire hot ' Unless controls get absolutely blown first couple weeks August ' 


The controls South Africa Brazil, seen epidemic countries? (Bearing mind severely undertest report). 


One professors behind programme reckons vaccine good they'll need 30 confirmed hits already got UK pandemic died down. It’s really hard figure OP talking about, post history indicates United States Trump, Ivanka, Kushner get first. deserve work done.. /s asymptomatics come visit stay long enough take dump.. ?

this whole thing strange.

(I'm doubting findings...) use site's data. ""inpatient"" data less 24 hours old ""discharge"" data less 24 hours old. looking ""hospitalizations"" tab upwards 3 weeks old admission missing greater 60% cases. completely pointless look tab gauge short term trends whole reason started crunching numbers myself. Wallace informed Trump U.S. seventh-highest mortality rate world, president asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany provide statistics.  handed Trump chart European Centre Disease Prevention Control left countries lower rates U.S.

His staff lying keep happy point. great discovery science, also extra vaccine produced moderna pfizer means get back normal months sooner, hopefully challenge studies aware of.  targeting areas hard hit (like Brazil) simply waiting enough people exposed determine efficacy. faster people get exposed, faster results in.  simpltons can't wrap head around tests 100% accurate. Cracks up. Translation: getting worse. liked answer question, justify tradeoff protecting abused child covid leaving without safety net? Idk that. baby sitting get cousins walking around 4 paper route 12 year old. parents refused let system stay home alone 16 absent minded risk. lit stove fire forgot making microwave Mac cheese...in pot stove...without water...on high...for 3 hours. Don’t care lol Ah. districts around necessary staff spread unfortunately People spread outside

Not stated. Outside less risky. Key distinction. meaning ""less"" different ""not"". Shocking best tests FlU BrO song turned rather foolish idea, considering effect public health response let's see SniFFles song might turn out.

I fear surprises. Agreed, point view seems invite hostility. safe anyone, students, teachers, families. conclusion

Political+Economy Science Union Serious question: studies scientific evidence there, legitimately, masks harmful? don’t stifle spread virus all?

I keep engaging people say “Well, agree disagree” can’t help answer, “Well, encourage read scientific studies this.” thing is...this isn’t matter opinion. FACT masks either help don’t help, harmful harmful.

They answer, “I’ve read research sides, thanks.” usually go say anyone insists people wear masks bully.

I wonder actual, true, convincing research read actually support claim better everyone point go around without masks? exist? read opinions treat “research”? 

Thanks. I’m baby couple weeks I’m fed people, tired scrolling posts. try engage least one person day. Love sentiment point trials ensure be...unless happened numero uno Phase II trial. Lots people already antibody little less placebo understand phases correctly. necessarily works.

You would multiply probabilities like independent events.

Here example, let's say wear mask cuts risk 30%. Great. may catching large droplets low velocity droplets.

Now, let's say person wears mask cuts risk risk 95%. preventing large droplets entering environment slowing droplets.

So combining benefit reducing large droplet transmission ways... Getting 96.5% but, also makes easier mask stop whatever viral load happen escape mask combined effect could well exceed 99%.

Note, specific knowledge mechanisms play are, pointing out, statistical standpoint, there's reason think two masks effective multiplicative effect. People going bars restaurants spending time family friends. There’s six feet you’re crammed around table sharing food. dont understand trying tell. Europe managed get outbreak control now, US didnt. Isnt obvious? Fair enough Sorry stupid comment. Either doctor master Coronavirus knows experts advising various governments around world he/she full BS stabbing dark. That's literally immunity works general yeah - already play

remember fucks sanctioned grift; vote office big debate whether money gets distributed via unaccountable grifter-administered slush fund political patronage kickbacks administrators

I hate break you, familiar America? That’s going happen whether POTUS R name. *real* debate administrators get kickbacks. „Invincibility“ kill parents grandparents… virus definitely still going around Netherlands April May Sorry man... hear out. turd sandwich least getting bread lettuce it. mean put effort u get food completely avoid turd together. Giant douche even functional douche due size... completely worthless. That's November I'm writing turd sandwich. i'm glad making strawman attack. nobody talking deep state. strikes Feels like malice Deaths equate poor response was. Data suggesting matter unfortunate super spreaders timing.

We reacted quicker, confined efficently, put laws place efficiently respected social distancing pretty well. closed schools 17 cases... anybody else continent did.

We literally everything could doubling down. else would us do?

I urge simply google ""Quebec covid cases"" stares. Look graph especially. example response working. literal flatening curve. Understood. 
This reservations total disgrace. hard believe people live like U.S..
Don't let word reservation fool you. nothing like reserving table favorite swanky joint. There's lot context involved claim understand, scientists one trusted universities world confident, maybe already pretty solid evidence efficacy, potential efficacy.

Logically possible comment longer-term immunity vaccine, we're little half year pandemic.

The shorter vaccine protection lasts, harder deliver regular booster shots billions people logistically. look like stop-gap effective vaccines treatments produced.  antibodies likely stay around.  seen evidence produces T-cell response. point believe would offer immunity covid, resistance it. Alright, well, thanks anecdotal evidence. evidence support fact protests caused spike? all? Would like show evidence didn't? There's plenty that, though methinks could find wanted to. Trumps base want someone 1, keep confirming conservative anti-abortion judges, 2, keep trolling libs, 3, say nasty things people hate. probably problems behavior, see tradeoff willing make. see that. many economic logistics factors compounding. really solved testing PPE supply chain issues, front line medical staff simply exhausted. Throw social unrest due evictions, blowback November's elections, blizzards locking things down, things could go bad catastrophic. specifically said, responded badly respirators. treatment prevented, that's medical malpractice best systemic euthanasia worst. Seriously talk gp ask him\her this, serious Like original comment said. much innovation. 

That said. thing. power them. Whatever helps good. 

But again. impressive innovation perspective. 

Now anti microbial mask kills covid 19 it. impressive innovation. market joke pre-covid, thought prices everything control then. post covid influx interest taken next level. Ranches smaller towns selling 300k. agent getting views day gojng miss opportunities. take 24 hours view house bs. comment nothing want. I'm pointing entirely early patting Walmart places back, could give shit less employees customers. profiteering pandemic, assuaging public's fears safety theater keep cash flowing hand fist. wasn’t quarantined? She’s part affected demographic. - there’s cure stupidity. article: Healthy 13 Year old DIES! 

Also article: Kid definately experiencing covid symptoms. I’ve 100% noticed wear mask people glance me, clearly remember wtf happening world, avoid more. It’s great doctors similar professions understood, virus cause meningitis.

There even close enough research know and/or Covid-19 activates meningitis bacteria causes brain damage. know yet. 

So that's hyperbolic speech. Walmart wont enforce though. Someone posted tic tok went walmart training guidebook said someone comes without one ro simply ask put one allowed deny entry say medical restrictions That's called garbage management. job prefers stay home cold vs going 'showing' sick. trust us abuse privilege. management operated way, we'd much healthier society. Instead, businesses put profit health, things like flu, currently, COVID-19, go crazy spread like orgies Woodstock. Overweight many = chronic inflammation. pre-diabetic also = chronic inflammation. Inflammation seems key cytokines storms, could wrong. lazy find sources again. Actual fact: causes death besides COVID-19. Might money time thing. people, need money time carry results out. jobs access temporary disability. generally extra insurance some, all, employers offer purchase. Yes. Ah Burlington's finest.

I know else would work. know communicate non believers way would get understand... perfect world, parents violate covid-19 isolation sending children school sent jail manslaughter teacher dies infected student. always loved zombie movies.

Now feels like I'm living zombie film. terrifying imagined years ago. claustrophobic helpless feeling everything gets closer closer home....like I'm nightmare. reading second post, tell good understanding bigger picture. mean that's main reason many people hell-bent reopening them. It’s sad. recall many years ago oldest (and time) grade 2 Friday said throat hurt wasn’t overly worried throat, teacher pregnant twins thought ya know, let keep home case pregnant throat gets worse don’t want exposed something.

Well strep carrier got terrible strep laid like three days brought back school told principal home like legit almost choked idea would think teacher keep home. 
He said wouldn’t believe number kids coming sick nurse 845.

Thing fortunate stay home mom could that. go work wouldn’t able keep thought morning sore throat.

I won’t judge parents stuck rock hard place. They’ve likely set way purpose victims shit work conditions.

It’s terrible society like here, work, sick kid school, job loss. Wtf. Well mental health important physical health. think problem part benefit package. increased parka sales would boost economy! folk store wearing masks, much prefer use effective mask exhalation valves. know. could like- try flattening curve again. test know is- isolate cases. Please hug grandma right unless taken 100% precautions last 2 10,000 infected people 45 die this, without adjusting comorbidities (thus, probably 0.1-1.0 10,000 healthy people 45). 3.2% ages 65-74 though, 19% aged 75+. Kids go school sick. Adults go work sick. people do. pandemic want trust everyone acts rationally human behavior is. less stupid. They're cutting funding CDC, cutting funding Covid testing, kicking people expanded unemployment benefits. worries! Nice talking you. That’s distressing say least thank information, hope sees it. town lots teachers offering tutor, brings income course medical coverage. Somewhere must solution agree, live NC rural parts see people ages wearing masks public. think Fauci referring specific places like tourism FL CA people going beach night without care. 33% us can, progress always blocked 33%, malicioy1/3^rd country.

The remaining 1/3^rd damn lazy damn ignorant care Yeah maybe millions dying months. We’ve 140k US far. incredibly high number millions. Certainly many would haphazardly pile dead public. You’ve got brain worms dude say all! thought masks nothing preventing wearer infected. Could coronavirus similar herpes? contract remains body result flare-ups? Could become undetectable? innovation groundbreaking research. pretty neat put production allow access N95 compliant masks large population. crushing mass. bad others havent stayed strong. mean go store daily practice social guidelines like mass baystaters. gone feom one worst trending 2 percent weeks. Lets crush this. good fam. Unless wait line hours, reasons. thought otherwise?? distribution vaccine entire world isn’t something that’s done snap. It’s complex. Masks already made political issue— likely happen vaccine. every single person get right away unfortunately. Oh sweet sweet Summer child. office, sick vacation days pool.

I figure someday I'll call ""Sick shit"". think I'll abuse sick days instant vacation, might well crime time. get violated typically get picked anything cleared up, that’s nature order. violated, go jail hearing. I’ve seen exact scenario, guy took wife hospital, violated, proof there. still sat jail 3 weeks revocation hearing ultimately released back parole. 

That insane. Thank explanation scenario. can't even imagine position like that. guy must relieved least got wife hospital yet angry punished right thing worried wife would get home well-being away. many overwhelming emotions. think universities want re-open stipulation catch CoVid-19, pay entire degree.

I mean, it’s safe re-open right?

/s  Ah, thank accept correction.

What really looking quote find make goal important get children back school unintended negative consequences occur keep school,” Fauci said.

I believe prevailing opinion sub like that, brushed aside consideration made sacrifice order get back school. Well written article... point, know Chad Stacy couple cruising beach kids summer collecting $1100 week state+federal money making excuses cant return thier $550 week job.

Trump's appointee running USPS goal fuck badly enough less resistance privatizing it. could try delay mail around election, actual people work mostly lifelong employees would turn whistleblower. I'll take called asshole. absolutely right, kids ever plan it. never forget, children once, childhood ""ended"" 12 years ago memories still fresh. grew toxic, violently abusive home. Covid would hell psyche, seeing school safe place get hurt able eat. I'm private introverted person childhood, common refrain people need break shell there's good person hidden inside.

On serious note, seems consistent I’m seeing hospital. tests coming younger age groups course can! worry clearly sick since could asymptomatic. Considering news waning immune response keeps coming out, think treatments really future, vaccine. Well, got voted out. wiped TP. both. There's drastic difference transparent engaging citizenry Vietnam response. Whereas China often accused covering things up, Vietnam held good example clear transparent communication. Thanks! I'm half decent situation. Staggered attendance two weeks (1/3 student body time) get introductions, hand Chromebooks, set expectations, etc. go full online notice. Unnecessary risks start, tied law funding something, go figure. help set tone gives small window worrying spreading. 

It bothers everyone acts like 6 feet distancing means anything small classroom 90 minutes time non-medical grade masks worn non-medically trained people. better nothing. Time exposure confined spaces worry me. surprisingly large number children live elder relatives.

We're going learn lot, better worse, next months. statistics get blocked first. suggestions don’t deprive family breadwinner significantly endanger health? hear crickets. agree, little kids left alone, choice leaving alone gathered somewhere supervised group they’ll get infected, bring virus home, infect you? Especially grandparents likely table unless it’s done semi permanent basis, since allowing accidentally infect kill grandma would kinds traumatizing. children shorter adults respiratory droplets go high likely isolated home.

Noticing things act say biases huge. done Toronto/Canada, point NHL ones playing since case count low. Well yeah, antibodies would bodies first response pathogen, yes.

But immune system antibodies. antibodies don’t last months, wouldn’t want last long term. antibodies every infection you’ve ever floating around, wouldn’t good. Nice. Make sure everyone world access it. “Walmart also created new role, health ambassador, receive special training alert customers rule find ways resolve issues arise refuse wear mask cannot wear one.”

How ambassador enforce policy s/he authority? Totally. Americans don’t want admit best. tons examples things work countries (hello masks!) act like won’t work don’t come it. true fool one thinks knows everything bound learn nothing. One explanation read reason height. Children shedding virus lower level compared adults. Hence, especially larger droplets fall ground quickly, viral load generally well dispersed, reducing risk infection others. realize children separate species adults flu's bro. children shorter, respiratory droplets fall shorter distance.

Just saying. rectum. way bowels jowls. Yup!! remember..... Pretty sure buddy texting shit stockong fear text. went got another beer fridge. also Kawasaki like syndrome connected Covid19 consider kids

The Kawasaki thing connected coronavirus, far read. memory serves, 40% nyc kids tested negative covid-19; there's always certain amount kids getting kawasaki every single year, regardless. Luckily, treatable. I'm USA reading blew mind. like movie happy ending. thought American movies almost always one lol. state tiny farmland lol suck cowboy states except Hawaii worse Vermont right now; that's particularly meaningful statement. 

Compare Wyoming. *smaller* population us, also **extremely** rural. Given logic, makes perfect recipe belief vast majority cases concentrated population centers, yes? largest town Cheyenne, 63k. That's bit Burlington's 42k, I'll gladly hear argument 20k crucial offering it.

Wyoming build similarly Vermont; mostly rural areas dotted several little population centers. Except Wyoming's rural areas basically *completely* depopulated. ""design"" basically same. Bunch small-to-medium dots population sea rurality.

Anyways, Wyoming 2x covid19 cases roughly 1.7x cases per cap. [Their cases distributed across state, areas Burlington-esque need stop comparing wearing masks wearing seatbelts. That’s fair comparison don’t wear seatbelt get accident, doesn’t mean person may die.  use seatbelt argument one crazy/mixed people, see “yeah, want kill wearing seatbelt, mask, right.”

You need compare drunk driving. Driving intoxicated law could kill lot people drive drunk.  Well guess what, carrying Covid-19 wearing mask, could kill people. I’m saying mask wearing law.  I’m simple saying STOP DAMNED SELFISH WEAR MASK PEOPLE. only. We'd back normal people gave much shit. Idk people quick assume small minority people. 

Like yes, it’s true don’t know yet. know common cold coronaviruses reinfect 3-6 months. idea one could far shocking. fact, seems reasonable assume may sort fading immunity proven otherwise. used?

Yeah except first one belief held literally like nobody, least negligible amount people. I've never actually seen anybody, even people sub typically *incredibly* concerned virus say murderer leave house. hand billions people indeed living every second lives like ""it’s flu yoloooooo"".

Don't try sides this, two bipolar forces, equally wrong, dividing society. Falls means fail. Lol shameless self plug Governments Europe magically supply food, labor intensive supply chain somewhere.   send military support, that's know sure pandemic big deal that's blown proportion. Personally think turd sandwich better giant douche... No, refuse take COVID19 serious behest Trump.

They perfectly OK dying, Trump look bad. making 10 hour. Logically can't keep young kids inside forever. Define ""temporarily."" commenters yelling ageists funding went elderly?

A private citizen donates money help struggling group suddenly they're equality healthcare universal everyone. I'm bringing rural factor brought 90% top comments. hard understand.

people thread know first damn thing vermont, act like we're high mighty voted bernie stupid shit like that. even worse; act like understand state better actual residents. 

the fact people can't distinguish vermont's ""rural"" wyoming's ""rural"", particular, infuriatingly stupid. ok, boomer? real. awful here. People shit good news know why. Unless we're seeing asymptomatic case. Would nice article bit info that. Considering we've see ""one offs"" like this, hopefully testing anomalies. wear months... oh boy. Trump Administration need tried betrayal country, countless deaths they're creating. Ok sorry sorry, see it’s recovered 11%. point you’re privileged/lack life experience think people instantly move whenever anything bad happens. shit takes time don’t family, figure sell house/break lease(which take 60 days easily) plus go interview process, sometimes literally involve hundreds job interviews. family it’s often even option uproot move. comment shows you’re ignorant dummy little real life experience. good news science pretty clear surfaces aren’t primary way virus spreads may actually quite rare people get infected them. Washing hands always good thing health, likely won’t get infected wiping everything down, wouldn’t worry that. read something said we're 2 weeks away everyone country knowing someone covid, currently dealing covid died covid. sure checks cases rise plan stop it, matter time. really believe point, people believing get smaller smaller overwhelmed voices telling stories themselves, family members, friends spouses catching virus. People care hits personally case matter if.  student (soon senior) I’m worried school saying governments capitalism end captured corporate oligarchs. 

Only planned economies stand chance stemming tide mass extinction. Sure, except things far universal US. I'll taking precautions sround aren't. needs explanation¿¿¿¿ want majority population get infected kids playing kids asymptomatic stay inside temporarily get virus control? Think logically. think we’ll see happen purple zones. Sometimes alone better. given restricted access park, people staying long. people working park, vast majority gone incubation period. that? he’s out, look back everything undermine efforts control charge (everyone complicit) seems fitting. I'll take 20. Sure. Now, go look long human body maintains antibody response infection . . . I'll wait. hope not, well. looking many times common people keep fighting battle, over, throughout history (and, seems safe predict, throughout future species) pretty fucking discouraging hoping stuff front. whole world /s hope mask use new hygiene habits stick around. saying weeks? criteria looking issuing another order? Indoors decent mask wearing. also wear mask I'm biking hiking activities like that. know Church Street Burlington surprised hardly masks. outdoor dining tables like 2 feet nobody wearing masks. businesses Burlington seem take seriously though nice. work independent school, we've never teacher shortages. Every time there's opening 20 teachers trying get job, standards usually high (Masters, 5 years teaching experience, international teaching experience preferred) isn't. troll lying. Block move on. Dont waste time, happen. Better donate money opposition, get people register vote, etc. Meanwhile USA... ""erm, give figures CDC get Disney World open? That's ok right? "" AMERICA FUCK YEA local talk radio yesterday, guy saying think isolating shutting things down. reasoning people 60 die virus working class serious risk. Therefore keep going normal.

I excitedly waiting host put place. Instead agreed assessment complained government going far. 

These people empathy, understanding statistics, concern overcrowded hospitals. ""Know Rights Camp"" reportedly focused assisting communities color ""disproportionately"" impacted COVID-19. 

It's pretty clear he's assisting communities believes severely impacted virus. clear anyone bothered read article good faith.

You clearly commented based pre-existing biases Kaepernick. matter did, would disapprove agree previous stances.

Do world favor fuck off. indeed odd. personally know person (I hate clear) lost sister mother still thinks hoax... think social distancing universal mask wearing contain Coronavirus also reduce flu common cold cases winter. I'm surprised. Disciplined behavior hard enough adults, think kids would better? study specific many kid experiencing symptoms area colds kids colds kids near people Covid need tested kept seperated.

The US high number infections time *cannot* track near someone infected widespread community spread. 

This also one study, contradict it. can't go one study say ""this 100% enough make decision may cost kids lives"". part worth listening tells situations like safe send kids (kids contact).

It's situation countries in.

Where kids died there's cases. That's true here. care much germs take packaging everything toss rather deal wiping. lot stuff 2 layers anyway. mean, also wearing mask endangers others around you, yourself. anyone go without? 

European countries afford provide basic level care can't USA afford itself? USA poor country?  Start rollerskating. let's nuke Australia see happens. Everyone dies anyway! looking easy way habit making evidence based decisions.  welcome 4-6 months ago, heh knew back still n95 got valve I'm using unless seriously big emergency, collection normal n95 surgical masks use till then. Wow, sure hired lot crisis actors one. They're literally everywhere.

Sarcasm BTW... Scary. potential consequences severe. greatest worry ,you know guys don‘t die something, miserable rest life. Florida also vitamin D, less density, different factors. Yeah, seems quite obvious put kids situations see higher chance exposure... higher chance infection transmission. lot parents literally don’t choice puree food drink straw? funny thing VT’s population trying attract younger people live state. program pay $10,000 [for remote workers come live Rich? No. Overstretched? Definitely.

We've gotten used month month funds cycle. Everyone emergency funds. Businesses already paid sick leave. 

Springing businesses... yeah, sucks. always case, problem timing.

You also realize that, laws like made big businesses mind. Small businesses arent big money makers forgotten. u smol brain? sometime tbh. like able causally keep people via statuses rather pressure message chat. Hard explain really bit family talkative especially send email message necessarily tell much. able check comment things without pressure messaging nice. 

I honestly think lot people get rid crap Facebook limiting screen time pretty hardcore clear including people like idiots social media. I'm deleting people astronomical rate right now, leaving groups, unfollowing things making much pleasant place tbh Oh came takeaway...
Sanitising hands right  problem think it’s crucial every one understands ego, cognitive biases, fallacies. chance get spread match light fire research minds. way understand figure within. Really? Several school districts around opening elementary K-3 middle high school hybrid 100% virtual. suspect it’s combination fact virtual elementary schooling isn’t super effective AAP recommendation statement young children don’t transmit virus easily. I’m sure common solution is, it’s definitely there. would complain “lame stream” media negative talk percentage death say don’t talk people survive really isn’t bad. used live farm month ago. farmers lived completely convinced coronavirus hoax blew mind. Like yes, entire world ground halt, markets crashed, 500,000 people dead it’s fake - gotcha.

What turning point? affects personally? bet affects personally. 3m mask currently manufactured large scale. Like every construction site/painter/builder uses them. take exhaust valve 3m mask something similar mit mask.  LOOOL Maybe that's QUARANTINED FIRST. literally quickest hardest quarantine lockdown age group.

You seriously putting head sand know child deaths occuring due covid. lolll !!!! Oh shit really? That’s wild Trump indeed POS, get point article. boy tested negative. It’s sad system pits school state/county tied hands instead school getting individualize instruction actually work what’s best kids. one asks wants know teachers think. Michigan nobody gives fuck Many School systems reopening August, probably higher. Hybrid Schedules half students go part week others different part, means lot kids makeshift daycare between. recipe disaster terms spreading it. Add Private Schools trying capitalize offering person 5 day week schedules. wait. mention, could sold millions MAGA masks fund campaign. getting 60 million Obama?

Are counting unconfirmed cases? Cos could apply Trump well, plus deaths taken account, Trump way worse job insufficient science make statement efficacy face shields.

See CDC: best get board cloth mask. open tourists? Oh yeah, $$$... protects others. Many hospitals doctors’ offices allowing them. Every day something new. world must go on. feel like america treats virus like treat climate crisis. people think made control thinks goes away ignored really designate one two hospitals county non covid procedures only. way people need pace makers, chemo, cancer surgery, stents etc place still get procedures done necessary. Eehhh...what consider ""big?"" mean, Philly like 2.5x total state population VT consider midsize city American standards. Burlington populous city VT slightly larger Podunk town grew up. I've multiple times loved thought quaint. doubt people might aware trying part, really can't downplay significance population density this, too. Probably go back quarantine ruin economy make sure Biden wins. Unemployment figures dropping, schools reopening, businesses reopening, NDQ ATH.

Yeah economy totally crashing. Yeah scary flights resuming. long time fear covid here. Seems corporations tourism sectors chomping bit open. Silicone oven safe. There's cookware it. I'm getting many requests go hook (albeit attractive) people I'm like, bro, right now? People dying Soon fear emotion left feel cause ""fEaR mOnGeRiNg"" Thanks! They're always asking ""when ever going use this"" gotta use situation gives you. former Republican, lot conservative based social issues like abortion overlook ""trickle down"" never seems make way good ole boys parts party. 

The Republicans good sounding Christian without actually acting religious values. Christian Conservatives pay attention, easily fooled. lot churches kind ""wink wink nod nod"" regards vote for...""I'm going tell vote for, know need stand Christian ideals like pro-life marriage man woman."" Yes, I’ve seen often, too. already know poor ethnic minorities contracting disease dying higher rates wealthy white US: 

As everything. Money power choice. people welfare say ""lol stop hitting yourself"" offer branch pull quicksand need branch make toothpick of. Dead? seen death rates disease? always get downvoted pointing out, say large percentage recovered patients lose antibodies months recovering: anyone comes screaming vaccines supposed boost antibody counts way past convalescent serum levels, may mean might couple months more. real assessment durability vaccine well 2021.  current vaccine studies, aim conclude months, answer that. Warp Speed bogus delusion sell public, we'd effective vaccine end year, vaccines cannot reasonably assessed effective least year followup observation.

This Russian ""ludicrous speed"" path, well, puzzle one out. someone keto diet covid, I'd like respectfully disagree. child pretty bad asthma misses 3 days 6 week period get letters mail threatening take us court. 

She almost died 3 years ago necrotizing pneumonia brought flu asthma know every year required take mandatory attendance education class (because missed 10 days) explains lose funding every day child misses.

I sure hope changes cause annoying hell. Oh, US figured out. businesses prioritize profits else incentivize short term profit long term health. calculations decided impact deaths far outweighed short term profit.

It's incompetence driving policy, lack thereof. intentionally making money backs dead workers workers need rise want happen.

Calculations done matter never have. MIT mask enables manufacture large scale due construction mostly silicone compared complex 3M mask linked. eat mask on? even go restaurants. awards never missing school day ludicrous. kids almost always sent school sick point year. Potato fuck needs scientific evidence?

Like, it’s common fucking sense. Worst case scenario masks don’t anything, still don’t harm way, wear one ffs? Right, even though shortage ventilators *just standing by* case needed it. Doctors prescribing Remdesivir desperation (and often family pressure) despite knowing effective given within first 1 (ONE) day initial infection.

Most patients getting already ventilators - basically total waste.

The drug given high risk patients test positive demonstrate recent exposure.

We running drug wasting 99.99% it.

TWIV mentions almost every clinical update podcast. Another sad factor final reality check occurs willfully ignorant, place blame hospital instead lifestyle. delete Facebook keep Messenger  Heard speech yesterday. ""Lockdowns spread covid"" there. prefer refer ""Crackhead Grandpa""  need concentrating treatments cures, like things like tuberculosis, pretty much everything antibiotics work on. vaccines profitable, so... Iran 25 million cases, America ain't shit now. Ahh old ""in interest public safety common good"" lie.  


Are willing toss blanket tyranny every issue public safety, blindly selective? Yes also sorts systems place make society run successfully US have.

 work urban area high poverty rate. would think schools lower socio economic areas worst performing. case. One highest performing schools district one one poorest areas kids vunerable crime high. Part reason school get high scores students involved school much keep attendance high. give awards lots things spirit days students likely miss. big draw emphasis students want there. article America... can’t know it’s like die death you’re fucking dead. article: ""Nausea, vomiting, chest pains,” said. “That list pops up, little bit, initial search, symptoms.”

On July 9, Maxx’s mother took get tested COVID-19. test came back negative.""

Sounds like something else. list symptoms could anything. every person sick COVID-19. Stop click-bait headlines give us actual facts. Way put damper birthday. think worse flu, would object signing waivers? horribly misinformed. definition capitalism nothing free markets competition, definition capitalism economic resources owned private individuals profit.

What seeing right capitalism. schools places started opening yet? so, statistics general info thats working far? schools open im curious much worse things may get us. Niqab protect someone virus, whereas FFP2 mask does... question life death, religious pride. riots nationwide, start White House drag fat fucking ass there

No joke, dont care state covid point, suffocate pressure numbers, cant tear gas way fucking nation Florida, many rich families (most second home here) come South America summer vacation, different US. literally enroll children school months. school becomes daycare. lie make way three times around world truth even got boots on.

The study prove theory, definitively ends debate.

Or should, lies like slugs, leave sticky trail. Religion ruins everything touches, especially children. took 150,00 deaths 1 Goldman Sachs study. fucking wear mask social distance? quite true. Massachusetts hit 14 days declining cases reopening, I’m pretty sure couple Northeastern states well. You’re correct though meet guidelines, many increasing cases. We’re skeptical it’s Donnies idea. he’s kinda proven he’s ok people dying. Sooooo *They think coronavirus real threat.* get news social media Fox, mainline Trump's propaganda, think overhyped media liberals.

Because they're stupid.

Seriously, overthink this. Sure lets open schools. God president moron. least LGBT people seem randomly show every gene pool. We'll always around somewhere.

I worry point Native Americans die government gradually crushing centuries. 2020, past concept race dying out?? Remember estimate factoring idea warm temperatures would slow spread, factor likelihood many School Systems would open numbers trending up. likely see higher end numbers, more.

Let's ensure continued appreciation medical professionals essential jobs dealing non mask waring Karen types. Envo mask. reusable silicone mask similar design MIT mask.  it’s clear, could help communication.

Good luck 2 filters covering mouth. Right *looks around* economy fucking crashing fucking. Closed. rest world faking it? Enjoy motion blur! one educator another, well-deserved award. paraphrase Boris want, man want lockdown. wants death.  Sam, fought alien diseases before! Call Hammond STAT get team going.

Also Trump G'ould (sic!) don’t know much all. Kids tend die, know. It’s like stock market human lives🥰
Fucktrump New York State DEATHS per 100,000 inhabitants... great example Man, guess joking theres nothing WA generally pompous Victorian come back bite ass Refused pay people? 600 bonus per week, even worked part time. know plenty young people never made much money lives. Many people bored afraid virus. shots seem promote strong response, stronger people get natually. bet hopefully lasts 1 year few. actually model emotional talking point? think that's Fauci praising NY for? I'd cut money testing tracing too. mean, millions people already it. bother testing tracing? Waste money. clock started soon left tested. known ""negative"" moment checked sample. Hell might gotten infected made home day. 

So plan *is* precisely treat infested asymptomatic covid-19 spreader. Then, maybe behavior appropriate response. interested anti masker kooks. really get China hate coming from.

China good Taiwan South Korea, better. forced lockdowns, mandatory mask requirements, temperature checks, contact tracing, strict location tracking.

Just watch video US trusted. Trump administration straight lying Covid numbers, trying fudge data coming hospitals, trying cover deaths, much shit. Sounds right Florida. ""good fences make good neighbors"" know lot Daniel Griffin, infectious disease specialist who’s handled 2000 COVID patients?

I gave one reputable source. want dismiss risk. Awesome! Keep up. died contagious plane crashes, might noticed. That’s worst part.. wearing condoms means stupid spreads  Vermont also one nonpartisan states I've seen. Bernie Sanders Senator forever Governor Republican. Political campaigns rarely negative. Government tends move pace instead following party policy rhetoric. really think plays big role everyone pushing direction states. Funeral Cannon!  one today -  implying best case assuming immunity permanent, rate, would take years. need read rules sub. Im switching places, entire small city that’s covid free dance clubs beer pools hottubs movie theaters WA here, dealing 20 cases state size Alaska Texas Combined, population 2.6 Million. 

Today we're footy match 30,000 attendees allowed attend. masks social distancing required. 

We're island within island, life usual pretty much past month two. businesses shut reopened. businesses reopened less staff. Fiancé baby shower today whole bunch friends family. Kind bizarre see what's happening rest world Perth, apparently second isolated capital city Earth. right youre able hold one idea head time. community spread control?  Oh, yeah, like fighting camouflaged enemy decided yo shut eyes off. Brilliant! worse take weird rant. calm down. Fr, everyone vaccinated 3 months once, ends. Basically, need 8 billion doses 3 months eradicate COVID-19. Yikes  Optimistically something end year start next year. However, deal logistics producing vaccines getting public. Luckily we're mitigating partially stocking vaccines tested, whether work not, we'll solid inventory go already. unwoven, woven. Allergy? Drug tests? mean they're already content farms pushing fake craft videos, shitty ""tasty recipes"" wildly shared facebook. matter works, gets clicks. 

Why shitty conspiracy videos too. Push bunch different narratives, fan flames whatever caught on. know *many* governments coorporations astro-turfing, even reddit. today meetup 1,000 teen tiktok influencers somewhere new jersey. videos saw little masks. i'm sorry they're going cause lot cases Thanks sharing

It may may true. think early elementary kids ones need prioritize getting back school Sure they're safe there, star developing diseases, specially mental. 
There's good way look this. seems reasonable. “suck up”

This attitude really needs die. work virus. work well though spreading fear, ruining children's lives reason. Imagine small child now. like child abuse victim. right let's go 2 years. Problem solved, it.  Napoleon 20 year old French Army Revolution occurred. took decade rise power.  like trump. actual moron learning disabilities severe mental issues. 40% country think fine. Imagine I'm sorry definition opening seems require something specific ""indoor dining restaurants"", again: states looking better right now? states handled reopening better? state better now? rather doubling refusing admit wrong.

His NPD literally prohibits brain admitting wrong. Ever. even himself. pathological. Also Bernie Sanders contract tracing damn impossible virus like super infectious......whoever thought going work aimed high. vaccine, nobody count people play safe. look mask rants occurring businesses. Chief Executive lies it. November can't come soon. major argument Ny's numbers European travelers came Jan, Feb, March. Everyone knows NY number one international travelers US itinerary.  Here's another experiential learner agree. millions Americans. Uh.... No, are... kid flip history textbook see case. U mentally okay? ""He j0kInG, oBviOUslY!"" Or... Saturday? interesting China many people yet spot containment virus.... hit Google? Second? Fiftieth? use LA County, better use entire NYC Metro Area.

Thats fair enough.. must started recently. looks like sources use estimates simply based ""housing units"" picking biggest possible number one city smallest possible transparently deceptive.

I agree. honestly mean that. ever look data related LA, 99 times 100 LA County. I'm pretty sure [LA's odd city That's generally common practice refer LA County numbers. Every news outlet does. NYC, otherhand, defined city limits.

Seriously, try find numbers ""Los Angeles City"".. [It's rather easier compare LA County NYC. unless show coronavirus numbers city, go 153k 10 million people 4k deaths. Compared 226k 8 million people whopping 22k deaths NYC. virus spread close contact, honest, damn important. Spread directly related people packed together again, sure know this. respond further.

That's I've saying whole time death mortality rates important number infections case, nobody messes chubby ninja! shouldn’t going anywhere anyways! Face coverings Melbourne designed able keep businesses open keeping people relatively safe. least damaging economic measure available Lol that's was.

Napoléon Bonaparte, a French military general statesman. Napoleon played key role French Revolution (1789–99), served first consul of France (1799–1804), first emperor of France (1804–14/15) understand you’re saying it’s hyper urban I’m wonder concession you’re looking actual definition rural think there’s massive misunderstanding personal affront you’re feeling.

The US massive even bottom 50% density isn’t really argument favor.

You seem arguing median (or close to) exemption classified rural? one comparing culture Vermont Wyoming don’t know you’re getting at. n00b. Elementary school.  Good. VIVIM UNA SOCIETAT  like sensory deprivation sensory overload somehow happening time. I’m sorry. cheering prototype doesn’t exist didn’t anything useful hasn’t proven work real world. Hey magic beans help cure Covid. drink bleach cocktail stick sun ray asshole. want unpractical medical advice pie sky bullshit go Donald trump. me.  stats already case. wonder real reason Trump sabotaging fight pandemic believe mostly killing people vote thinks somehow helping him. Gaah! think leopard would eat face! I’m wishing anyone ill, it’s also scary people like get ever mild symptoms. could see doubling even it’s big deal ignoring hundreds thousands dying states doesn’t get bad personally.  hindsight. Let's go back February. Covid-19 deemed ""respiratory virus"". So, one take true SARS, MERS influenza, use defaults Covid-19 evidence proved otherwise? read last March.       
*""It early days, initial amount virus person infected doesn’t correlate severity disease symptoms, would mark covid-19 different influenza, MERS SARS.""*    
What saw instead was, virus innocent proven guilty. seemed obvious reduction ingestion virus likely result milder illness, hearing mask baloney surgeon general Dr. Fauci, decided Federal government relied on. mask reduces *infectious dose*. Duh.       
There health departments around world. rely science instead campaign strategies.  think I'll opt science oriented ones guide family. federal government go stick sun shine. Tf Vermont? hear out, they’re safe ship, disease free, yea away loved ones family would suck im kinda getting jealous disease progresses America Many know aren't.  cases neighborhood college students attended one two different parties nursing homes. South America giving side eye. Visitors infected areas huge effect. 3 million Europeans flew NYC area January, February March. hard see happened. horrible exactly. Americans conditioned trust experts. alternative facts. believe seeing reading. Truth truth. Yes, unless military hundred million Americans show well, I’m doubtful he’ll actually removed. BLM protests asking human rights equality met resistance military. doubt asking leave would go well (plus protested presidency back 2016 protests are).

I’m going keep contacting representatives. seems Congress able something. Besides Covid, there’s bounties. I'd hope Europe's excess mortality back normal. controlled virus well. im starting think people might actually this.....at peril, too, foolish Lol  know somewhat subjective, personally, think president's spouse, sibling, ex-spouse, parent-child relationships banned public office. 

now, would argue go even further, ban first cousin, grandchild-grandparent relations well, i'm open idea well. 

at end day, lowering (but sadly, eliminating) nepotism &amp; corruption within Political Dynasty. called Inherited Privilege. 

It (in part) thanks inherited privilege lack racial/ethnic/religious diversity amongst political leadership. 

This something society strive fix.

But apparently disagree.... understand why? Yeah. That's said. use hydroc side effects used Corona. Even anti-malarial drug development phase. doctors nations reporting success, (obviously) know coincidental. Again, that's said happened.

I'm gaslighting anything. Remember Trump stopped travel to/from China Corona, called racist policy? Joe Biden came said never would stopped travel, wrong decision. reality hindsight, move saved lives. That's probably obvious example anti-trump bias work, going healthcare professionals science favor current agenda.

The fact talking Trump leadership means performance contested. ""undisputable fact,"" precisely disputing it. importantly, half voter base supports Trump, give take 10% given moment. Undisputable something like need breathe live, Earth round. Anyone cares try breathe learns quickly can't live, anyone goes suborbital even knows world round experience. Claiming something undisputable mean is. fair though, masks don’t offer much protection monitored. recently, CDC didn’t even consider pregnant women high risk group. special access accommodations work.

It’s insane took 4 months pandemic CDC even acknowledge pregnant women higher risk complications. Lots posts like coming theme park staff now, afraid speak case get fired feel like maybe didn’t read and/or understand article. they’re talking key metrics, they’re talking specific method look data provides value. method positivity *rate*. number goes down, even increase positivite tests, we’re ok. Got it? advise read responses original post. stands, working proving vaccine. Even type responses. Fact is, gets approved, approve unless deem safe, one best lines defense. believe say infant carry genuine risk catching virus. Especially take going shopping. affects ***all*** us, age immune. I'm studying French. point however Canada letting us feel way too!! relationship grown much stronger boyfriend. relationships families improved well. first read ""absolutely crack"" Even could reduce severity catching Covid-19, would game changing. reason herd immunity strategy doesn’t work it’s deadly. Covid-19 could reduced vaccine treatment less severe, could approach pandemic new way public media campaign instilled young people social distancing staying home noble thing launched. little bit sustained media blitz. well. I'm saying kind thing needs looked per capita basis. Sure, FL people overall, make worse somewhere else less populated.

5% people dying community 100,000 people tragic community 5% community 5,000 people. got want die 9-5 boring ass job.

Yeah majored but... anything me. want anymore. die stupid virus, would definitely like ""oh man wish worked could manage projects"".

Fuck that, mental list things would undoubtedly come ever deathbed, I've done far few, far times.

That shit changing care make 30% make now, want happy wake happy sleep looking forward next day. Yes UHC would problematic run one Atlantic provinces, similar (rural older) demographics Vermont - case prosperous parts country spread costs risks. worry comes going beach driving anywhere long distance, even destination remote. gross, can't really poop ocean, happens gotta go? planning renting remote cabin woods pre-covid thought keeping reservation socially distant, I'm one ladies pee time. able hold four hours want stop public restroom. say ""Oh really?! That's great news! going rich!""  
Then go explain upcoding they're describing would constitute largest case Medicare fraud history. 

Since False Claims Act rewards whistleblowers around 30% total amount fines, penalties, restitution amount imposed guilty healthcare entities (which case would mean thousands hospitals around country), we'd probably talking reward hundreds millions dollars point....maybe more! need gather evidence, give attorney, pick Lamborghini color! using baby numbers wait till next year then, use brain looking Texas Florida's numbers. clearly catching new York clearly great. look naive. stop, lol.   I'll try 3 4 weeks schools Florida open. see meant. admit low risk group, reason wear mask, masks like 8 different styles point still love Target curbside pickup. would anyone choose go store to? Dude, fuck participation trophies. risking life. deserve god damned medal. types things honestly make life worth it. miss much. I’m Northern Jersey. Classes high school return fall, teachers required wear masks. students. imagine small high school ~400 unmasked students ~35 staff members? Doesn’t help majority students come low income neighborhoods, people risk. Also doesn’t help majority staff aren’t exactly young. Also doesn’t help we’re expecting 2nd wave soon, rate transmission NJ growing.  let people freedom want without Nazi it? Thanks! I'm still concerned get anywhere SARS vaccines nearly 20 years managed poop vaccine literally called SARS 2 less year. Shit add 🤔 

I'm concerned ""side effects"" ""government chip"". absolutely getting vaccine comes out, think ever coming out. think told vaccine ""just around corner"" keep us calm placated get adjusted new norm. assume like flu. 

Just flu mean can't get again.

But hopefully body resistance since fought before. I’m hearing good things Invigaron abani bare-e protocol  Phase 1 data showed atleast safe. AZN CALLS FTW time really anti vaxer idiots concerned, vaccine made 6 months rushed. period. human safety trials normally take years, matter what, matter safe trails indicate vaccine literally enough data duration study harm people unexpected ways. fully intend get vaccine soon also going taking damn hard look trails data get hands it. Banning travel China allowing 400,000 US citizens return without quarantining contact tracing doesn’t make sense. Banning travel/to China without measures (preparing tests, stocking PPE, UNIFIED plan actually), giving contradictory advice claiming it’s hoax (but also hoax), doesn’t make sense. 

The US government’s response pandemic is/was shit reason we’re still flailing today Awful human being. disregard life country despicable. you’re downvoted? bunch miserable fools. I’m talking kids 6-12 years old don’t self-regulatory capacity drive learning. Shutting schools long massively exacerbate socioeconomic achievement gaps education, rich kids get help parents others fall farther farther behind literally may never catch up. I’m talking global perspective here, US. think high schools beyond course remain shut, REALLY important understand consequences shutting elementary primary schools social mobility, getting people poverty, massive impacts global health. That's already well known league tables post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* believe obvious actually obvious study professionally.

Which say really obvious, spite naive insistence contrary. missing facts.

The information conclusive would like believe. Given know, wear homemade mask *assume work*. take additional risks it. Despite knowing already happened Italy Spain... think people trusted get right. 

25% covid deaths happened New York, 6% population also lot immune response antibodies. cells remember infection reinfections would less severe. way soon think antibodies fading quickly means immunity. immune response way complex “produce antibodies” predict it'll fine. New Zealand also well control? believe already manufactured large scale Same! day checkout grab item getting 2 feet away someone like ""I'm sorry I'm close you"" luckily sweetheart it. fully masked and...god wish regular life. couldn’t care less people want honest. despise media (as article depicts) social media warriors clearly ignoring reality. audacity people calling folks self entitled pricks pretty good understanding sentiment want go bars. Let’s fucking fair? that? Report include EVERYTHING! article like reporting results football game mentioning one team. Again, beyond pathetic even deadly virus America turn childish political agenda. stage 3 trials tens thousands subjects recall correctly.

if gets approved, know need know. sooner, better!  Idk saw somebody insta wearing mask Florida Disney. people small percentage. mom teacher first all. Second all, irrelevant ability teach nation isnt reliant one person. 

What fail. Maybe try tomorrow.  Could anyone find sources article? Radiology support worker here. low ranking get. still frontline, still dealing COVID patients every day. Also think finding antibodies drop there’s evidence immunity memory cells? I’ve bit bored I’ve missing friends. going walks dog woods places stay active also socializing friends though FaceTime text. sucks it’s better us meeting putting risk. lot kids getting bored I’ve heard teens parties. work even important NASA teams preparing moon, Allied preparations invasion France 1945. people, others putting real work vaccines probably important people planet moment deserve protection. governments aren’t locked allied effort baffling. wonder Trump administration Russia/China try foil efforts. They’re already trying hack research systems. Even year long would great right now. already get yearly flu shot yearly Corona virus booster shot question me. Especially keep working effective longer term solution. Man, one morning like two months ago got awful headache felt weird disoriented, started shitting like 3 times 5 hours. woke middle night fever.

I like fuck, that's I'm fucked.

The fever never came back, continued poop constantly felt weak 3 weeks. Turns weird stomach bug. felt awful, can't imagine corona must feel like. also curious basing anecdote raw intuition. Neither means anything. 

Not sure hostile dismissive. made valid points discussion thread. Cool out. Why? operation warp speed gave AstraZeneca $1.2 billion ordered 300 million doses.

Why world would allow it? bad news you, that's going happen What’s fun imagine anti-maskers also anti-vax.

...so unless mandates everyone gets federal government...

US, donate blood free antibody tests. Yes! Thank you! Mom works front desk busy doctors office (about 6 doctors work office). come contact multiple test positive cases! Mom high risk wish recognized efforts more. point, hopefully positive already recovered!

Edit:. I'm assuming self quarantine... Jfc people. That’s great. people quick take vaccine development less year. risks. I’m saying won’t, I’m saying questions safe is. understand, right. sucks much kids parents, lot empathy.

However, role sacrificial lamb. government long relied schools fill gaps failed fill. day cares, health care providers, restaurants, socializers, mental health specialists, social workers.

We educators. wear many hats, simply cannot responsible everything. taken many responsibilities long. responsibility endanger lives help parents work.

The government time figure safely provide child care parents need it. money bail corporations, none invest alternative day care? failing. responsible. Canada would tag mask use inside around 50%. demographic groups better others. homemade masks recommended protect wearer.

Which turned completely false. Go /covid19 find research says (the obvious thing) that, yes, masks protect wearer, too. 100%, hey, even N95 protect 100%. protect %, useful. 

Yet, still bunch dumdums claim otherwise, even though would simple laws physics. Yet, still fight, reasons unknown. Probably ego something.

Now eat words everyone left position - WHO, CDS, Fauci... guess **safely assume** doctor not

Big nope. Or... People take pandemic seriously stop gathering large groups. guess called *fun caring lives others* Right? bizarre psychology..... Yep.  ended first ever panic/anxiety attack (I don’t know differentiate two I’ve never happen whole life) due pandemic. Scariest shit ever felt. rent worries article says causes body produce antibodies well t-cells t-cells remain viable years. work remotely, can't someone Costa Rica India job remotely much less money?  Careful wish for. cousin negative test positive. sure viral fragments. needed two negative tests work. gave go symptoms time. Florida favorite place go think hotels shitty Florida you’re wrong. Also get way cheaper airfare Florida overseas, even flying: plenty people take one two day drive well.  Plenty airfare deals Florida $100-$200 ticket you’re flexible. Don’t become part problem. think happen capable citizens move another country? vulnerable us that’s left behind countries don’t let older, less educated, disabled people immigrate without substantial wealth. We’ll unable much anything fight horrible conditions remain.

That sounds like 'you problem'. country sucks bad people want leave able go places, maybe try suck much.

If die America it.

\- Rest world. We've tried, even living Montana, ""easy enough take kid insists walking herself"" publicly accessible outdoor areas crawling people, tons tourists. Plus gets pissed car trip exceeding hour length scream hoarse. we've stuff home yard, find crawling walls cooped since March. 

We supposed celebrate anniversary family cabin 1.5-2hr away three days weekend, husband get anyone cover shift work get extra day off. 

Since takes day get there, get set (utilities turned on, stuff packed setup, cleaned winter shutdown, etc), would leave evening second day get home work following day, get enjoy half day so. worth it. helps 3 days least.

But really, wish people would wear masks help end sooner. else easy
...and might work. Plus, they'd stop close businesses restaurants, economy could keep plugging along (what keep complaining here). give procedure produce vaccine everyone something secret chosen production units? get respect that, people hard denial Covid-19 Main Street coming back. 

These inbreds still live 1960.

Good math skills, there.  last sentence tells you’re even worse months ahead. I’m suggesting downplay it, continue work adapting situation. big brother elementary school teacher tells they’ve figured lot new ways make things work. innovation occurring help repair damage. 

But mind, can’t say disruption damaging people literally losing lives prevented. can’t save everyone, reduce death toll. perspective, education continued largely undisturbed online many challenges initially things improved students teachers adapt. 

Staying home isn’t perfect answer, US least makes sense tell. also live Midwest thus far spared compared coasts south. I’d love keep way. vaccines making antibodies, they’re also making T-cells. That’s immune system works. basically stimulate Tcells antibodies made. saying article really makes question entire article. “Available” misunderstood many.  mean availability production. It’s unlikely vaccine available end 2021 early 2022. I’m 50 - make difference. would nice since Dad nursing home it’s hard him. too, thank kind words, internet stranger Haha bought account mean read article? Cause that's exactly doing. university sent email saying test positive mandatory report. Campus shut sent out. stand corrected, bad. time wait line Americans love good bargain tend poor impulse control. Plus know much love gamble! agree. county coastal CA, we’ve mask order since March. people actually wearing masks correctly around people. took time people get used it, like said, federal order went alternate world, people would already used wearing masks now. healthy people get vaccinated help herd immunity protect higher risk folks. vaccine known safe sick old would still slow spread, right? Wait get one day! Awesome, please send link. ""We going ensure every American access vaccine.""

(They love hiding language like that. Access to.) Phil also pretty good job I've seen.

No mask mandate. Vetoed paid family/medical leave wants reopen schools. that's covid19. good fortune Vermont gotten 10k cases, assuredly change end year. Mark words. Cases explode, time Scott responsible thing, damage already done. give credit saying eventually right thing, He's certainly like certain gathering similar views US.

Oh, disagree. ask making mask mandate sounds *exactly* like certain gathering similar views US... he's quite literally figuratively part gathering. terribly miss crammed buses trains use take. bus train ""me"" time perfect listen audiobook catch news. even miss crazy people. also miss office, restaurants downtown, art house theaters would go weekly. working home thing overrated think lot people work feel same. Kinda nice see people wear gloves store too. wore since March know it’s kind extra oh well. Hey man, best thing stop visiting sub. people hang live bubble doom terrible mental health. Stay strong, homie. ""The cruelty point"" I'm going interact driver (I contactless available). cause think risky interaction, shows respect driver probably lot people treat poorly. easy do, not. time lived Florida hell it’s worth it.

Every Saturday I’d go breakfast corner restaurant. didn’t leave 10 am, wouldn’t go walk back basically guaranteed shirt would covered sweat I’d need shower.

Walking around day mask overpay food, nah I’ll pass. Yea, 300 million doses vaccine. Body bags cost less PPE next scan suppose September looks like Ohio heading another spike. I’ll probably put next year. Half-assing ad skipping number important steps. *Sigh*

Common cold caused 200 different viruses, 4 coronaviruses (although widespread cause something like 15%-20% colds). importantly - there's need vaccine common cold.

HIV completely different virus. one, one can't recover it, immune system can't fight something poses difficulties create vaccine (which invokes immune system response). essential worker, 100% getting Vaccine ASAP.(I put ordered packages trucks get sent house) airplane put oxygen mask first, child's.

First help helpers, otherwise there's one left help. Avaiable sept, reasonable pricing ;) 

Hint: cheap rich. news! Water = Wet totally agree. also - soon schools reopen flu season kick - make mistakes anymore. imho hope vaccine magically fix anytime soon fugasi.
personally, risk group. work home. shopping per week n95 respirator. low risk getting infected. still - concerned essential workers. need protect them. 'essential' feel oblidged respect work. sad anti-maskers (and friends) killing them! caveats here: around 40 people clinical disease (ie positive test symptoms — primary endpoint trial, positive tests) vaccine truly reduces incidence 70% likely trial would stop early (i.e., 60% power detect large effect). 

If 40 events trial stop early, continue 80 disease endpoints observed data checked again. 

Keep mind flu vaccines rarely 70% effective. flu (Bolsonaro, looking you...), it’s useful reference — 70% really good vaccine. 

So yes, reason optimistic. there’s whole lot go right order vaccine arrive quickly article claims.

As going senior year student tell literally body learned online schools all. would much rather push back school October/November us go July next year. Hell comeuppance. Yeah! believe science science man always changing science story?!!1  Universities sure, K-12 schools really go back second it’s safe (which isn’t basically anywhere US). many needles. Sacrificial ...I mean essential workers next  Find numbers ""Los Angeles City"" yet? 😂 Honestly, certain Trump send rural states lowest spread vectors first, prioritize rural areas populated states. He'll spite favoritism. he'll load places up, even enough medical staff administer shots get.

The urban centers vulnerable, Trump hates those. We've already seen tax changes specifically benefitted right-wing states harmed left-wing states, left-wing states dared spend money education public welfare significantly higher land home values.

Trump's version politics favoritism get away with.   dont worry, deaths counted Covid deaths That's shitty 700 SQ ft houses somewhat gentrified neighborhood $600,000 kidding, especially preexisting anti-vaccine cults. 
 
A needle *and* booster every 3-6 months? gonna smooth. Honestly anyone constant direct exposure virus considered “frontline”. I’m even saying jail guards hospital janitors given it. ""Became known"" ""gained recognition"" couple possible choices answer failing business infect kill people?

I call bullshit. Money important people. economy would benefited much selfish assholes would shut fuck done right thing first place.

By building ignorant block selfcentered science deniers pander to, businesses fucked us greedy benefit.

This needs dealt correct way actual people impacted, try save meaningless inanimate businesses. raise one question though: happens candidate vaccine *doesn't* pan out, one turns clearly better rest? spoken they'd doses case? I’ve heard schools recording lectures. Downloading flash drives, distributing that’s at. Again... perfect long shot. works saves lives. feel lucky too. We've lot ""sorry asshole, I'm stressed/depressed/whatever"" moments. probably helps work remotely, we're pro masks/quarantine, we've agreed open feelings. 

Also I'm hermit staying home bothered bored me. Absolutely!

Don’t get wrong, want over. 

But pharmacy technician make workload double accompanying pay raise. Vaccines cures. They've done flu shots. years back shortage get one think 50 unless really needed it. course, approach like makes harder people can't get doctor's note get vaccine even really need stupid healthcare system resulted boatload uninsured people millions people lost jobs. 50,000 cases UK 40,000 less deaths. Something seem right here! metric fuck ton extra pneumonia, flu excess deaths good measure mean yeah... They're humans too. Hate break even it’s good it’s still long way approval. trial small sample size , many sites, many unknowns double blinded, randomized, multi site thousands patient phase 3 won’t know true efficacy safety vaccine. Jared's new Saudi shell company fine job distributing vaccine ""fairly"" ""at good price"".  Nearly 100 million doses coming UK Sept/Oct, enough us!

I need vaccine really bad. hear athletes also track


And field demonstrably false people get covid one day.

Which one proved, certainly you. understand asymptomatic means? impressed.

Who again? reaaaally stay sub common cold vast majority time rhinovirus coronavirus. Secondly, common cold MANY different strains difficult narrow major strains. lastly, zero push funding get vaccine common cold death rate common cold like .000001% thus priority all.

Regarding HIV - ZERO COMPARISON HIV corona virus. None all. HIV much deadly, impacts way body, mutates incredibly quickly nearly impossible make vaccine. hand, COVID mutate much all. Certainly much compared HIV.

I mean sound like I'm attacking you, points made wrong hopefully type change stance hearing facts. totally fine wrong long willing admit it. Fauci many experts immense confidence vaccine matter when, if. Man still almost (normal, alcohol) hand sanitizers like Lysol wipes stores here, Amazon's still ""out stock"" mode almost every day. 
 
I really thought we'd tooled now. supply chain stuff tricky. made conspiracies, fake news, general dumbfuckery ignorance great again. people way visible now, even Denmark. Especially online. think it’s reasonable still person classes / groups dealing special needs children. don’t expect adapt well accommodate changes necessary make online work. fine compromise allows... I’m sure today like... make maybe four percent students?? we’d cutting risks 90% mitigating damage developmentally vulnerable group. 

I think work well proper precautions. it’s really rural area... know literally don’t cases city?? probably places like rural Missouri. Maybe students go back, strict travel bans, quarantine measures, etc. think proper adherence protocol could accomplished massive risk reductions.

But vast majority us, especially city students. access internet. live high population density areas risk. need staying home. Again, perhaps minus special needs students. I'll naming first son Oxford it. Folks like tend grab onto single study two missing research support it.

If insist believing bandanna going save everything, make things worse. trying convince others take risks avoiding.

Stay away people much possible. assume mask allows party, protest whatever like doing. going keep killing people.  love see sad America can’t get shit straight Well news least. There’s lots else TV, news gotten elsewhere. real metric watch:

How many Americans snuck Canada

Please watch Americans! answers question, they're 'essential'. could push lax operations because.. well.. they're essential. leverage. strongarm laxer operation (for profit reasons, obviously) closing would far detrimental.

Completely non-essential businesses bend backwards much easier get shut back down. media onkybtalks ""tested positive"" - almost never hear I'll person tested. weird, listening news could easily believe one gets I'll covid, randomly get tests pop positive. wanted say feel you. know helps, I've weird heart pounding like trying beat chest years I'm still alive (although frustrating manage). heart rate jumps 50bpm stand seems rapidly move look smart watch. think POTS, I'm sure. Reducing stress, cutting stimulants, getting rest, eating gluten dairy, various supplements seem help, days comes back awhile. I'm trying figure there's trigger. far seems dehydration (not enough electrolytes), poor sleep, stress, I'm borderline deficient vitamin. doctors go also use anxiety card (I'm wondering is?), say I'm young healthy worry unless pass out. Keep us updated! think concerned going access whether distribute people need privileged. Really hoping diabetic, almost 70 yo mother recently sent back work in-person get vaccinated someone like Justin Bieber. well say sayin anyone else kinda wary vaccine developed relatively short time compared long normally take? **Dude, you’re going let track like that? wants track movements! Stay away vaccine!!!!**

*Sent iPhone* Fair enough. I’m surprised hear Trump administration incompetent, trust vaccine producers source issue. yet first words previous response ""you're right"". Thanks main component vaccine, inactivated chimpanzee adenovirus, actually tested years now. quick google would show seem completely ignorant  obviously know you, feel you. shit really hard right now. get better though. Make sure does! whose gonna take Sheesh. Oh fantastic, sausage fest thirsty gents trying compete handful women. Cases going down.

They've gone TWO WHOLE DAYS Florida, spiking new highs. ""narrative"" desperate need defend President. post history public. Indiatvnews go reliable news/ Dr Hawking would proud hey mexico gov hates us well Look video therapy friend trend hard pin down. solid trend setting deaths first started increasing, broke slower growth rate. change seen pretty clearly moving average. schools open /s Yea don’t understand anything. That’s sad. Crunch numbers prove wrong. won’t can’t. close relative Biologist Korea researching antibodies Daegu. definitely possible. Yeah, people confusing making bad call early correcting call data came lying. society. People opinions freedom share them. like something? Downvote move instead crying. Guys, I'm Texas. They're ice skating, everything fine (*muffled screams*) Keep good work pal 👍 Yep, never get upset kids. always feel deep sympathy them. one wants remembered kid threw class. also empathize parents choice send them. get fired miss day work. often not, it’s usually parent thinks kid either lying “push through”. 25 million would mean Iran halfway herd immunity. That's Sweden-level hopium. I've read phase 3 trial end September. need time go data that's works great. phase 3 failure could months work. United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa. 

The $1.2 billion dollar deal US AstraZeneca [400 million understand need extras 70 million extra doses population seems like bit much. seen anything max manufacturing capability AstraZeneca. problem. many people banking vaccine released months even though that's purely hypothetical. Keeping people working bad thing. totally shut right now.

The issue enforcing laws prevent bad behavior extended public emergency. issue denying Americans something Americans cannot afford it, stupid philosophy. agree not? Dwight's baby mamas died Covid.

This true all. Dwight's baby mama actually died epileptic seizure, COVID-19, according sources online lol

Source: 50 percent people stupid, number rising everyday fluid pump whatever fits agenda day. cases say deaths down. deaths say cases going down.  cherry pick number pleases. it’s abysmal say they’re great job controlling spread mayors thank him. It’s comical farce. What’s French word it? don’t trust politicians make optics rather actually help public. already officials lying numbers keep states open, yes I’m gonna skeptical.

Ya’ll wanna read “hoping best expecting worst” thats weird hate boner. least go online talking getting vaccine promoting would helpful dealing anti-vax/mask crowd. Ooh that's nice. He’s moderate Republican. There’s semblance left power America, really makes shame person stepping void underwhelming. wake COVID, opportunity transformative things like create actually functioning healthcare system. Instead, go work reinforcing for-profit system carrying like nothing happened. Lol voted speaking truth. wrong early response isn’t lying. Mistakes made learned. That’s science works. continue circle jerk man hatred. asif point even needs made people... fully obvious AF Everyone dies alone. mean leave pandemic over. one forcing stay. came back read :) alarmed? No, always err side caution situation. Rather wrong safe wrong safe Yeah, know, middle school high school students good social distancing 18-35 crowd.

I think dropped ""/s"" Like anything mask related, controversial here's article go along matter true numbers may considering types masks, proper wearing masks, etc; essential people get board idea mask help save lives.

And makes sheep, well, makes live sheep. Young people still care even hit everybody equally. Oh yeah, forget mention it. inside business medical facility four months Carrying gun shouldn’t badge lets push people around. Maybe type people would use gun argument shouldn’t allowed carry. pre-existing conditions. Wife active, fit healthy individuals. can't keep young kids inside forever. Define ""temporarily.""

Define ""permanently."" that, also need factor population density. even close that. I've always found puzzlinng people use YOLO justify recklsness die once. ""Let's open Disney World middle deadly outbreak""

""You literally want stay inside nothing watch Netflix next 50 years"" Dang, Ohio 40 deaths today. seen number higher since June 3rd. Pretty bad sign Sunday. Yes that's risk, trump wealth inequality, police violence likes bad, worse. I'm advocating slide back policies raise discourse trash talking bullshit. I'm super optimistic, know long endure lawless administration. :D elected politician federal level allowed ever hold office allowing happen.  think enough positive peer presssure would’ve enough people hoarding mask like sanitizer, wipes, Lysol, bleach, toilet paper. Even though wasn’t socially acceptable hoard things either. genuinely think would’ve different.  really dont need worry much sanitizing packaging. thought AAP’s stance reopening bit myopic since admittedly don’t consider teachers adults school. get they’re pediatricians it’s great children largely asymptomatic, viral transmission doesn’t happen vacuum. fact they’re factoring adult transmission simply “we’re educators” makes sound ironically anti-science. 

In interview guidelines emphasize teachers school staff members stay physically distanced greatest extent possible conduct meetings remotely. hearing lot teachers. Many are, frankly, scared go back school vaccine available. told feel health treated expendable. What’s message pediatricians. We’re educators. don’t want tread space don’t belong. would say depends level risk individual person. everyone basic level care left out? 

Everyone benefits, like European nations cited news piece. struggling see argument healthcare ill. risky idea. 16 men congregating Airbnb without masks?!! days?! Get real. Cancel. &amp; learned new virus, many surprises store. Everyone, please wear mask. yes, please Definitely. start school online, go person later. Seal team six going hunt virus. rock hide seals can't find. Finding Bin Laden training run this. think still wear masks social distance vaccine distributed?   would ideal, realistic. 

The medical stafd still wearing additional PPE all.patients, enough space usher every single ER patient isolation. 

I go ER right absolute necessity, always going car crash, shooting, stroke patients face much less rigorous protocol. better true lower, still present. another route infection. article someone posted stated effect transmission roughly 20% reduction summer weather. That's huge, virus hover 1.1-1.2 range winter could start fade away summertime. problem without preventive measures, COVID high r0, summer serves speed bump, rather bollard.  Shhhh... doesn’t fit paranoid conspiracy theory. 1) Traveling **from** Philly Charleston.

2) Playing two rounds golf hanging house/beach. bars, clubs, etc safe.

3) Everyone planning wearing masks, appropriate. Especially flight.

4) Yes. Additionally, job remote rest year.

5) underlying health conditions. Wife active, fit healthy individuals.

Edit: Forgot question hotel. Staying house. shocker. middle schooler going back school person year. yeah, definitely wearing masks! Everyone knows UV light kills virus it’s SUNday virus scared get burned light sun. strep one day principal called begging come sub cancelled last minute. ~~He convinced come half day.~~ late dont listen..... know simple ""people really like spouses."" relationship put extreme financial stress, without usual methods stress relief tough strongest us. addition, spending free time, without usual breaks day like work, school, friends quickly lead stagnating conversations. Yes, probably people issues before...but really healthy bound home constantly immediate family, matter much love them. us tools means adjust sudden dramatic changes lives.
Thanks gold! first award. I'm heartened see many people experienced strengthening relationship troubled times. 🤗 believe NYC Burlington, VT highest singles rate county, guess places least affected increase which, course, makes perfect sense. Divorce far better domestic violence, also risen new heights. you’re going break “Europe” countries comparison, also need break US states.

WTF happened Cali? control they're turning Florida. .  study published day said single wearer protection around 65% hear you. degradation, including destruction high-quality USSR medicine medical industry happened 90s. shitty dictator complicit privatizing industry making sure improve much since Oh good, know hyperbole all. least something positive come this. much testing people symptoms areas? seen claims children less likely severely ill rest us. correct test clear symptoms, likely miss many infected children. likely make seem like children spread much true, primary school modeled turning factory workers rigid schedules, listen bell etc. turning people know society works.

No concept loans, interest, file taxes many things know prepared adult life. Surprised pikachu face I’m fan “/s” live TN county mask mandate. It’s enforced.

I mentioned somewhere else, never 5 minutes away people Vermont. sure fuck wish right now, since assholes nearby shooting fireworks terrifying dog. live one rural counties. Wow, sobering read. I’m glad governor working mayors state despite party affiliations. Southern states sound chaotic. (Hopefully, don’t eat words later). Sounds like bad trip. *suprised pikachu face* poor bastards. America's goal complete EU Canadian level control South Korea finally China.

Don't try control like China, US even close. headline, perhaps tests accurate. Regardless virus cause LASTING damage. Brain damage. Lung scarring. Organ failure. Perhaps tested early on, viral load high - possibilities.

Perhaps virus situation early infection, lot viral load spread around yet. Perhaps due specific circumstances, mask face perhaps shielding little ways preventing virus getting released air compared without mask. Mask slows air coming kind thing. Perhaps relatively recovering.

Regardless need take risks! completely avoid first place. WHAT. TAKE BETTER OPTION! BETTER SAFE SORRY! avoid worry permanent health issues first place!!   That’s classification system works. cities 9,000 people...it’s based population. Technically Hempstead, NY town 700,000 people Willful malicious intent. Probably following Putin’s orders.

I’m saying statistics point things getting much worse. pandemic statistics need start paying attention trends, death rate low today we’re good kidding me?

The Chinese government knows wants turn number new cases zero, first report number cases accurately, basic

The U.S. government never intended zero new cases. mean lot questioning nuance around 65% claim. report says data low certainty, looked N95, medical, 12-16-layer cloth masks, overall data seemed pretty limited. 65% seems like upper bound best-case scenario. RIP. mean young people caring happens every country. Single issue voters worst, especially single issue abortion.

ok, ridiculous. ""vermont extremely rural""; *understand* people get idea. vermont ""big chunk land""? c'mon. we're way, way smaller, geographically, rural. We're #31 density, makes us extremely rural, #45 overall size, makes us ""a big chunk land"". still big chunk land smaller population single city

And whatever worth, Vermont *was* city, we'd 29th largest country. Smaller Denver, Dallas, Memphis, etc. larger Atlanta, Sacramento, Baltimore, Louisville, New Orleans, Minneapolis, whole lot more.

It's hugely inconvenient expensive, works.

""Naw, hard economy,"" economy burns anyway, people die unnecessarily, US gets quarantined rest world. Good. like stupid people (the ones without mask) anyway. bet math teachers could make startling COVID-19 word problems car windows numbers.

Basically everything shut except places genuinely essential (unlike US definition essential). experiences going different given social circles literally everyone knew barely left home 2 months. I’m sure much lockdown would possible. guess could even stricter people going exercise seems like chances outdoor transmission absolutely minimal anyway. It’s like much could even really went outside.

We time could approached worse case scenario didn't. 

I also bet task force said recommended general public trump took whole level.

My state fairly well. fingers crossed continues way. governor definitely listen trump(which pisses Republicans). think pay end.

So instead honorable thing trying protect fellow Americans, government issue mandate. freedoms.... 

There lot Americans lack critical thinking skills feel like stems from, ""I'm bad math I'm going try learn it"" mean got PA compare probably pristine could show someone whole documentary tell you’re fear mongering...so I’m going go no.

Urumqi far far west border. like 2,000 miles away Chinese live. think Alaska 48 United States SAD Wonder Child Protective Services notified? hopeful note, unity current administration near universal least.

I fear looks like inside ""bubble"". 2016 election shocking awakening that.   Thats like putting hand lava getting suprised burned hand FUCK EXPECT HAPPY MEAL FUCKING IDIOT. Wolf sending sick people nursing homes threatening withhold state funding revoking licenses county went yellow red Philly did. hit bullseye, rest dominoes fall like house cards. Checkmate Pastime* good sign you’re setting records weekend. Same, Ive normal dreams school setting turn nightmares start freaking remember pandemic... dumb actually be? explanation means. Citation needed, sport.

[This article ruins Denver, applaud decision imperative protect teachers, doctors, experts happen at-risk elderly. Yikes. No, I'm talking real world, I've done math.

At massive bulk rate...

Disposable masks -- piece cloth elastic bands -- cost *maybe* 25 cents each.

Nasal swab tests -- thin popsicle stick small bristles one end -- cost less that, *maybe* 15 cents each.

And testing swab costs little you, since skeptical, let's say mask popsicle stick cost **50 cents** each. tests cost **$25** each.

All conservative projections.

Obviously, ideally every American gets tested weekly, that's unrealistic unnecessary. test trace even 50% population weekly -- EVERYONE wore masks public -- we'd squash Covid four weeks.

But you, Mr. Skeptic, let's say need *75%* people get tested weekly. let's say 75% Americans need 3 free masks per week. Hell, make *1 free mask per day!* ridiculous, again, you.

So...there 308M Americans. 75% 231M.

Say need six months mask/test initiative.

That's 5,544,000,000 tests $25.50 per = $141,372,000,000, Let's round $142B.

And that's $21,483,000,000 masks, rounded up, you, call $22B.

So total cost squash Covid vaccine comes next February -- get economy fully functional weeks -- $164 Billion. (Actual cost probably like $100B even.)

We're losing **double** shut-down economy every week!

According [George Mason shutdown economy -- due inability refusal control Covid -- costing GDP 5% every month partial shutdown, **$1.07 TRILLION** dollars/month. Multiply six months get $6.42 TRILLION.

And again, we're talking rocket science. WWII overnight start making heat-seeking missiles rocket launchers 100-round machine guns warplanes trillions dollars. literally MAKE piece cloth elastic bands, popsicle stick bristles, simple lab work (yes, PCT test simple common cheap). simple affordable, compared we're losing. wasn’t people beaches, guy. Perhaps protests hundreds people something that? what? parents certainly have. thought would able probably vaccine July 2021 athletes, coaches, judges, etc. could given priority for. Getting everyone vaccinated time qualifying events though issue never thought likely won’t happen. 

It’s shame. Olympics would wonderful way boost world moral.   don’t use term anti-masker anymore. I’ve switched pro-covids. **HOBOKEN correctly, New York took direction them.** Wear mask. believe single word China says you’re wrong. many stories coming able cremate bodies fast enough. 20% US’s death count bullshit. never know many Americans actually died Coronavirus Hospitals incentivized fluff numbers money. I’m pretty sure CDC honest back risk shortages. Dr. Fauci also straightforward, along NYC’s mayor Cuomo...I remember watching briefings. lot people got really confused however hearing recommendation secondary media sources normal subterfuge misdirection reporting. media sources...but enough create sizeable population misinformed civilians.

The happened stories ventilators seized hospitals....when reality hospitals borrowed affected areas, promise replace brand new units.  words, amount misrepresentation issues certain media channels prolific. one thing certain: Federal level response completely inadequate continues be. I'm curious reasoning is? I'd say kinda is, part solution involves giving money people, reflexibly go ""pry cold dead fingers"" mode. could also provide incentives companies take enforce preventive measures clear punishments nah, nothing done, personal responsibility, federal one. Wonderful. nerve say isnt going implement mask ordinance people go jail wearing mask. Maybe start going jail killing people start him. George Carlin said, call ""because asleep believe it."" state followed NYs lead sent elderly infected patients back nursing homes lead massive deaths yeah, listen. state something good. Yay lmao good point talking SF? specifically stated LA. Yes, true. anytime I’ve said anything along lines past gets deleted mods. 

So reddit, countries 100% honest. Go get sunglasses grow goatee understand Incorrect. protests I'm stealing ""Stupidity Fatigue."" That's exactly I'm feeling. Exhausted demoralized. I’m guessing autopsy tell covid not. article held confirmation either way. Otherwise becomes fodder sides. Yes. really chance explore real online learning students. Spring crisis management. Teachers working summer building online curriculum, partner finding taking us two weeks build one week online learning. Totally agree spring shitshow, fair assessment online learning could be. also know teachers think online learning better person, best option right now. lot packing food boxes handing said food boxes too. SHIT. also put context expanded multi trillion dollar military industrial complex war terror fast approaching two decades anniversary... really puts things perspective. oxford vaccine developed already known, safe vaccine, modified. Unless immunologist, I'll take comment solely cynical speculation trust hard working scientists actually front-lines getting done.

If they're happy. I'm happy. This! movie completely missed point story. Smith bad guy! failure leadership. Letting turn culture war “stay house 24/7 9 months literally murderer” versus “it’s flu yoloooooo” turned disastrous.

A country real leadership would focusing showing people expand activity safely strict compliance. \*cringes memory burned legs metal slides\* probably spread effectively. idiot said less? data intended convincing. don’t theory reinfection promote. point numbers trivial come counter example idea state statistical certainty loss immunity less one year time scale table point.

My personal suspicion, based particular knowledge own, seems consensus actual immunologists mildly optimistic long-term immunity, can’t find immunologist willing say good faith **kmow** point. 

If you’re choosing ignore math things I’ve said post history indicate dislike Americans, well, doesn’t really much change opinion Americans. I'm honestly debating whether would want vaccines flowing veins, think don't. 

It's basically 2 big unknowns: catching corona experiencing residual long term effects vs. experiencing side effects giga rushed vaccine

I'm leaning towards 1st, toss impossible identify variables

We're rats experiment whatever choice may be.

Anyone preexisting conditions latch vaccines never let go, straightforward otherwise

I've tons vaccines life, none came pain, headaches, discomfort like one experienced 40 people. even claim things reach high level higher dosage. dont like sound that. seems low income american communities neglected would argue can't rely countries data shown United States uniquely terrible things like wearing masks distancing. countries everything infinitely better successful us. would mistake think replicate that. knew coming?

Everyone keeps saying kids get sick kids dying impact them. people got minerals see health workers see everyday. confronted truth means going comfort zone confronting idea wrong. wrong entire way life wrong.

Yup lawyers waiting extended times cases, worried screwing enough people. Divorce waste time brainwashed TV, media, internet-lambs slaughter...peons LOL paying teachers? What? Oh clearly teachers make much... /s needed study prove this?  third world also includes countries like Ireland Sweden.

Capitalism works. Yes advantage taken outsourcing, even done domestically still works. adjustd everything. Cost living goes up. Wages go up. Company profits go down. capitalism still functions  Sweden grade school day care operated without lockdown without incident. Ehh population density rank necessarily best metric. Look Nevada, example. Almost everyone lives 2 metro areas rest state empty. Nevada lower density Vermont.

Arizona, Colorado, Utah, etc lower densities well, many people one area balanced hundreds miles nothing.

Plus, way US settled, places like Vermont naturally gradually rural spread out, small towns every 10 miles vs west big settlements literally nothing long way. Yes, also means prudent act caution even already COVID-19. Right cannot say definitively immunity lasts *any* amount time, whether 3 months, year, longer. likely could vary range depending individuals' immune systems well. right people who've already infected recovered, best cautious assume immunity period may short. seem like things going well?

Thanks agreeing me, guess Yes infamously greedy assholes *checks notes* Oxford University He’s scapegoating avoid blaming leadership. Understandable I'm using information presented research that's available. Yea, vaccines magic fairy dust. Take good care yourself. :(

I plan getting date much can, know kids pets best spread out. 

I even want flu shot myself. hope feeling better soon comfortable talking downside are. I'm walking eggshells afraid called ""anti-vaxxer"" days.

I've never even met ""anti-vaxxer"". Maybe they're like Bigfoot Loch Ness monster maybe lead sheltered life. get attendance policy problematic, I'm sure would expect essay. course students would still turn in, otherwise learn needed to. Additionally, teachers grading deadlines required meet limit extensions give. legal requirements schools change them. grading deadlines 4x year gradebook literally locked day cannot enter anymore late assignments. 

The reason need take test missed soon returning school missing tests holding everyone else's grades feedback. 

You're right definitely difference private public schools. attended private school sibling picked work complete home sick. never seen public school that, although parents occasionally request send work kid sick able complete work home (like bad cold mostly recovered). guess feel bad single lol  people whose job record deaths often Sundays. Happens world. one size fits all. Weird. Putin whatever wants long Donny around test came negative even Covid-19 related article? GoFundMe page, I'm thinking everyone wants publicly trying tie everything Covid-19 get it, even test comes negative, link GoFundMe. let kid RIP. find hard believe counties less strict medical ethical guidelines haven’t tested re-infection already. Hell wouldn’t shocked military testing re-infection soldiers. Thanks reminder reinvention rates. definately confirmation bias look bad news. Vaccine meant create immunity, immunity get virus. People nothing lose act recklessly. Go figure. Wow. almost like humans....just younger. 

If think it, could mix bunch high school students college age students (like one's partying spreading around community) hard pressed pick high school students college ones. r/childfree list docs think. Also, keep asking around, found doc way country problems it. (not opening schools) likely right decision, limit spreading scientific sources directly confirm stated above. Try thinking reading something speaking. can't really dense, you? guess right. dead ones go, prepared quarantine state two weeks first. We're requiring people states quarantine. us favor go. estimated total population US 330 million people. Even every rich person gets first still leaves vast majority country able get it. Mad Taco good... call necessarily authentic Mexican though lol  Man, lot depressing see government messing things up. feel like maybe reluctant share info would reveal not-great actually doing, people know work making better. 4 months election

Not chance remember people would similar replies people would predict deaths bungled federal response. 

It's evident vaccine rollout experience identical one we're now. Same. actually abused loophole let drop already credits sick school day. Graduated time, technically high school dropout :) 100% this. completely unreasonable expect people high risk stay inside forever. think get used saying Ohio Man. always jews? maybe system focuses general population health capital gains... better first department. mean isnt outlier, Vietnam well, China well (considering started giant population center there)... talking kid died going Covid party boss said, ""but really die of? Covid kill you"" Dutch schools opened May 11 cases declining rapidly. Research also shows children 0-12 rarely get infected infections traced back family, school. 

Within families infections almost always traced back parents infecting children instead way around. I’ve rural Mississippi though? sub spew neoliberal propaganda? blame you. subs area elderly. worth amount barely minimum wage germ petri dish 8 hours. Especially someone higher risk category. pushed start date September. hope district grow semblance brain go online. swear, answer everything country push shit minds address right now. 
 
If start September, I'm coming wearing scrubs, lab coat, mask, eye protection, surgical cap. Besides mask, pretty much none dress code. Send hell home I'm dress code. There's corona there. [The CDC thing keep mind 40% pneumonia deaths year also marked covid deaths, excess quite large first seems. definitely still excess anyways. various parts VT June say two things. much lower population lot states legitimately give shit coming together cause. really enjoyed there. Ohio Governor takes action stop us becoming Florida.

Close indoor dining red zones mandate masks statewide fuck off. senior year 2021, probably spread much adults I'm divorce kids. ""Singapore getting massacred it"" even lol refusing look ""weak"" became weak. live one I’m waiting impending doom. 30 years Vermont never heard that. People's true colours harder hide stress. like delayed reaction. actually said post 9/11 instead trillion dollar war. said stay home aren’t willing wear mask.  Actually last 10 years pretty shit regarding economics. federal reserve can't raise interest rates without collapsing economy Wait till orders hospitals close keep filling many freezer trucks. think surgeons breathe ten hour heart surgery? They're adults, that's how. Would like doctor say uncomfortable wear mask? Come on--stop big baby. can't put comfort ahead people's lives.  Us military year end! Happened NJ.

People told quarantine 14 days they're going beach day trip.  Get little sun sand, spew spikey bois towns, grab slice pizza, head back PA mean, could least try. send back nursing homes. Yeah, right move. wear mask every time leave house hop off. pointing able say “JuSt StAy HoMe” privilege maybe people like bit understanding people can’t “jUsT sTay HoMe” there’s vaccine. Yes worldwide seems cases 18s dying, 9s, know many US? source says none. here's San Bernardido's local case/death charts, running 7-day indeed soaring. Deaths chaotically bouncing around quite bit. U.S. suffering self inflicted “hypercapitalism” capitalism expense morality.

This crux problem. Market worship US literally become death cult. four variables - community infection rate, human density, air flow mask adoption.

If infection rate low, classes kept 10 one ratio, windows wide open students wear masks, it’s going work.

If community infection high, classes 20 kids air conditioned poorly vented room, one wears masks, going act like gasoline fire.  That’s problem America, everyone treated like toddler: “look discovered today, Timmy! Isn’t neat?!” reality someone needs take charge start holding society adult-standards rest world operates by.  

A society won’t function society treats it’s people’s beliefs regard facts. literally grown adults whose incredibly harmful beliefs tiptoed danced around long are, them, indistinguishable reality. 

Look cost them. Look it’s done. Enough already. they're low risk themselves.

So old sacrifice young way around? CDC really offer IFR estimates age range far find more. reason, stopped favor lumping IFR estimate together one range.

Are health bodies institutions still offering age-adjusted IFR estimates?  I’ll take police annoying (their usual) citizen deaths day. didn’t wear mask, yet you’re shocked you’ve tested positive.

....what. bullshit: trying prevent corona virus masks like trying stop mosquitoes chain link fence?  think Sweden would better this... obviously agree stupid NYC terms, Elmhurst Astoria people might well different worlds. Elmhurst underfunded hospital serving deeper immigrant neighborhoods. Astoria essentially gentrified upscale Manhattan commuters hit close hard. People still use R word? article really says PROLONGED use N95, MAY lead changes blood chemistry COULD lead change consciousness severe... ""most likely happen already predisposed breathing difficulties, smoker, obese people, individuals COPD emphysema.""

The article also notes using N95 except healthcare provider work. seems like avoid using N95 prolonged periods time. ""smoking, obesity, COPD emphysema"" severe lung disease prevents wearing mask comfortably amount time, really going outside given respiratory implications covid-19. seems easier call hospital drive it.  I'm misanthropic quit job back March. want right knew would happen anyone else feel like lot wasted effort near neurotic levels surface cleaning going cases? work expected disinfect surfaces every hour, I've heard plenty people wiping groceries (which take forever).

Shortly work instated cleaning policy released surface transmission rare. I'm saying benefit zero, cost benefit ratio seems way whack. feel like could accomplished focusing energy elsewhere. Perhaps starting mask etiquette campaign use properly.

I feel hours spent day cleaning surfaces could put better use. Florida. combat sports event harder manage regular season NBA MLB game. lot government rules adhere to. Normally enforced local state athletic commission since fight island, self imposed. mean, biggest issue that... correct. someone younger, healthy, little fear. completely understand exceptions rule there, there's going thousands exceptions rule talking hundreds millions people.

I think one biggest issues unlike 1918 flu, covid 19 cusp many people completely statistically reasonable really concern it. Lam announced new social distancing measures last week, shuttering many businesses including bars, gyms nightclubs, ordering everyone wear masks public transport.

Restaurants ordered offer takeout services evenings.

On Sunday, Lam announced new measures including plans make compulsory wear masks inside public indoor venue - new order non-essential civil servants work home.

You telling place considering making masks mandatory public transport, things open, get 108 new cases? city crowded HK, hawker centers, guest worker dorms, etc.

Is anyone else totally puzzled this? We've good long people spoiled. needs people's health jobs. wish things different right now, honestly reason complain.  lot people lost lives, someone know, job. Went home depot last night. common trend saw would man walking presume wife, woman wearing mask man not. go Jenks Public Schools? Josh Berg there. say something. beyond suffering physical body. I'm even Christian, know one. parents sent child school charged manslaughter. RemindMe! July 31 Early release study time period social distancing schools closed. merged data 2 tables study single table:

I've take grandma couple regular checkups makes bit nervous she'll catch covid there. grandparents quarantine twice, aid got covid time simply going hospital quarantine. really feel grandma, easy time senior. 

Seems like great idea stop people go ER. live across street hospital seem this. like 5 times amount ambulances paramedics hanging around outside pandemic. seem wear masks honestly NYC feel like they've probably already covid. know two doctors two nurses. doctors got one nurses. nurse get oncology nurse I'm sure keep way way covid patients.

One two doctors also got malaria Amazon too. dude collecting plague stamps. One friends got bubonic plague 7 years ago, honestly thought they'd stamped that's entirely different story. Check Vermonts case/death charts running 7-day curves. every state looked like that, disaster would over. like 1-2% us die we'll move on. Another critical communication failure includes emphasis COVID primarily affecting elderly compromised immune systems. given groups always vulnerable health crisis. general public happen fall either categories given false sense security. lead lot ""doesn't affect mine"" thinking persists even know virus impacts even young healthy. country founded bunch religious nutjobs hack Europe.

Sometimes people wonder Canadians Americans different. Nutjobs founded USA. Adventurers founded Canada. Im shocked Looks like many people can't survive Covid they're exposed repeat. Give health. say wearing mask? mine got better, sounds like social engineering article. guys become conspiracy theorists fits narrative. Weird. said NYC correctly? thing understand enough beds invisible wall border states, drive far need find hospital. order high school kid take care siblings, need high school age kid, that's solution anyone banking on. 

Parents homeschooling kids, called remote learning, give teachers directive assume remote curriculum notice, go balls wall make best be. happened spring gave teachers literally 3 days prepare something never even considered doing. Right now, we're toggling back forth waste time resources. whole country knew, right now, plan Q1 remote, kids would returned building phases based medical data time, people could start planning lives teachers would get work well. Right now, parents selfishly suggesting someone else take responsibility, make sure kids safe. asinine, teachers front line workers medical training authority enforce safety guidelines active pandemic. 

Think kids going back schools places responsibility teachers, 0% parents. parents back work, hey! Everything normal, right? SCHOOL NOT. Parents get kids house, think masks social distancing, organize pay day care, incur risk extra responsibility whatsoever. teachers students? entire landscape changes, teachers become frontline workers gathering indoors dangerous scenario virus exposure, students unfairly asked go near friends, stop screwing around masks. 

It's logistical nightmare, parents need realize going back ""normal"", like February, simply option point time course not. wear mask. Quit selfish people’s lives stake. worked job wore full respirator mask day issue breathing. law 

I hate guy, I've seeing place. ""martial"" law. Coronavirus enemy.

Does guy watch news? Good call. everyone work home order groceries. people supposed live income? Here's Arizona's latest case/death charts, running 7-day disaster clear ending. wonder teachers want die. treated seriously humored majority human race might feel better selfish people like rising death toll fill dread. sounds like Wisconsin! pissed hear contact sports returning... Gee...could parents many adults around basically retarded? going moving products allergy season everyone form tickle throat? supply chains stay up? **Debate: Tidal wave long-term covid-19 patients awaits**

**Researchers Uppsala University: far, healthcare research focused seriously ill covid-19. covid-19 spread Swedish society means primary care must also prepare large number patients complex long-term symptoms. One first scientific case descriptions long-term patient published.**

&amp;#x200B;

Covid-19 known six months yet understand mechanisms control development disease. therefore high risk unpleasant surprises ones already received.

From Italy came disturbing news many infected people risk groups great risk never recovering covid-19. Netherlands, study recently conducted 1,622 covid-19 patients long-term symptoms. average age patients 53 years 91 percent needed hospital care course disease thus fall category ""mild symptoms"". fell ill, 85 percent people classified healthy. One several months falling ill covid-19, 6 percent considered healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

**The huge spread disease Swedish society** means primary care must prepare tidal wave people complex long-lasting symptoms (see fact box) coming years.

Support groups people recovered covid-19 formed many countries. One Swedish groups almost 12,000 members desperately trying give advice symptoms relieved. previously healthy young middle-aged women men.

Not everyone groups taken positive virus antibody tests therefore possible know certainty symptoms due covid-19. However, people group receive detected antibodies tests offered. show type symptoms yet time test themselves. Almost all, including already tested positive, testify difficulties obtaining treatment support primary care, currently lacks experience guidelines patient group treated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Many also become distrustful** diagnosed ""anxiety"", diagnosis also mentioned article DN, possible explanation patients' symptoms. find difficult attribute types ailments anxiety disorders.

In anxiety disorders, hyperventilation symptom lead lack oxygen brain. Covid-19 patients hyperventilate, contrary, often difficulty breathing. However, completely logical expected symptoms patients long-term covid-19 correspond anxiety symptoms. Many research reports show increased risk blood clots, so-called venous arterial thromboses, covid-19 patients. Blood clots lead lack oxygen variety tissues thus cause similar symptoms anxiety attack.

&amp;#x200B;

With severe intensive care cases, wonder healthcare research focused developing care programs treatment strategies severe covid-19 cases. time focus struggle long-term course illness everyday life stands stark contrast recently healthy life lived infection.

&amp;#x200B;

**All signatories debate article links healthcare** healthcare-related research involved patients covid-19, disease relatives affected. us reported preprint article, currently undergoing peer review, one first scientific case descriptions follows detail entire course disease, time infection mid-March today, patient prolonged complex covid-19 symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

• previously completely healthy marathon-running woman now, 125 days falling ill established covid-19, still daily problems infection. active viral phase disease, mild symptoms irritated lungs could live exercise usual. so-called Elisa analysis blood samples taken phase showed woman infected sars-CoV-2 virus.

&amp;#x200B;

• Day 45 infection, suddenly found difficult breathe taken hospital ambulance. hours oxygen, able oxygenate normally again. worth noting long time infection, viruses could found woman's airways. go home next day chest X-ray ECG could show signs illness.

&amp;#x200B;

• days later, is, nine weeks first mild symptoms appeared, became ill. Many symptoms occurred relapses (symptoms 1-8 fact box).

&amp;#x200B;

• woman's antibodies measured every three days throughout course disease. tested antibody positive day 28 infection day 85, ie total 57 days.

&amp;#x200B;

• report describes woman lucky enough receive good treatment support primary care. treated prescription non-prescription medications reduce risk blood clots relieve complex symptoms. Several symptoms may due virus' effect nervous system, difficult study. report also emphasizes importance empathic informative treatment affected patients.

**It gratifying government** commissioned National Board Health Welfare nail situation people long-term covid-19. However, utmost importance primary care receives support needed able absorb available research results regarding diagnosis treatment patient group. Without knowledge, many previously healthy people lost ability work due prolonged covid-19 process risk becoming mistrusted standing without help Swedish Social Insurance Agency. way, doubly affected, increase risk secondary mental illness.

&amp;#x200B;

It difficult stress enough importance prompt evaluation various therapies help anyone long-term covid-19 symptoms. also important understand whether early treatment individual symptoms alleviate shorten long-term illness previously completely healthy people. starting get functional virus antibody testing place Sweden, easier identify individuals whose problems attributed covid-19 thereby recruit patients type evaluation.

Ingela Svedberg, specialist dermatology quote doctor isn’t good enough (even though provided link support argument), want “opinions”?

Ok, you’re selfish best wear mask. people’s lives stake, you’re uncomfortable, important?

Wear mask, stay fuck home.   example, 2019 manifestos Boris proposed increase spending £2.9 billion year, Corbyn £97.8 billion. I'd also say underlying attitude matters well. never got feeling Corbyn McDonnell particularly cared much plans would cost, even really grasped matters.

I realised difference two much. think Labour manifesto last election little pie sky, things total dismantling replacing Universal Credits something would take long time lot effort put practice. disagree cared understood cost things. Labour manifesto fully costed explained planned get funds planned policies. There's obviously going things work planned paper lot thought went manifesto see party providing level detail (admittedly, could well due Labour cost high, simple chucking money know regulate media bias without placing unacceptable regulations freedom speech. decides counts also suggest becoming somewhat irrelevant anyway, means platforms Facebook, YouTube, Twitter Reddit regulated going important.

Yeah, media regulation huge task get right easy misstep.

I agree online platforms need held account well, think introduction fact checkers app decent start ultimately, think media reform tackle lot issues general public informed issues sides.

In mind, media reform needs put stop inflammatory language (such calling people traitors front-page), make sure critiques proposed policies fact-based, include sides (eg. Include criticism experts think tanks, editorials posed fact, detail original aim policy piece), put greater focus media retractions charge penalties falsities (eg. central hub detailing retractions online, similar product recalls charge % days revenue based prominence piece, front page, pay back 25% made, etc.)

That's simplified go on, already lengthy think way use social media mean reform media also impact way news circulates social media. Probably efficient high rise windows, maybe less messy. Sorry, VT positivity rate 0.9% means unlikely they're missing cases.

Most Northeast fantastic testing contact tracing system. Stick bum, mum. :) heard vaccine. Call Vodkamycine. Already there. Everyone thinks I’m doom glooming, pandemic really pulled Wizard Oz curtain back faith society. Guess changed name then. don’t need sex live. Wow dumpster fire sub become. make easily available stock price drop though.

There reason US politcians financial commentators shut Gilead Moderna.

Thankfully countries (UK instance) bothering test CHEAP easily produced drugs like Dexamethasone. think US pharma giants bothering include cheap already well stocked drugs trials? fuck! much blood hands administration never even declared war. would impressive utterly terrible.  contracted virus 2 weeks ago contracted 2 days ago (or started showing symptoms) safe us next other? virus reinfect cause current symptoms worsen? American, definitively state we're country full fucking idiots. We're absolute embarrassment. honestly ashamed country become. Ah 🤣 u kill Virus sticking guidelines 🤣🤣🤣 one tell measles influenza virus ? Damn , known ... wear one I'm asking discussion find difficult use time surgical masks alot easier n95 masks hard prolonged periods   everyone stay home never leave house???? Lol ignorant thing say. r/collapse can’t wear mask, don’t go out. emergency, everyone going able everything. It’s bananas little people willing sacrifice right thing. chernobyl third option. Create work force ability handle day worse comes worse half shift calls out(because news flash COVID highly unlikely everyone calling out). Pay good living wage sick leave fear repercussions missing single shift due tickle. Make healthcare easily cheaply available tickle gets worse actually see someone without fear bill. Make people actually take pandemic seriously people like spend every day wondering today day get infected customer tickle throat racking cough still feel like wearing piece cloth face. need pay good grades, get used work life. say COVID attacks brain. Smaller populated states much easier control. It’s big cities spread like fire. Sure, that's got trusting random internet sources. 


Do believe every random tells you, say so? need 67 Senators. doubt 20 Republicans going go Trump. January pandemic started seemed like person world actually seemed know word pandemic meant, made prediction. Minimum 1 million dead. conservative estimates put global death toll around 4-7million. also predicted point see heavy machinery disposing bodies. first 4 months year keep seemed like overreaction. Trump.... bets still open.  countries, Americans disease carrying foreigners. unfortunate, true. Less 3.5% imagine. That's percentage 10-19 age group colorado. That's ones tested positive , Buckeroo Tell Steinway // Astoria state highest rate residences able relocate model. Got it. guy idiot. Forget headline nonsense. Give reasons facts. Headline tells neither.


Edit: Phase 2 shut cell internet service. Phase 1 train people fear going public socializing. Take away phone internet... everyone hides home almighty governments take over. Didnt put covid positive people old people homes? remember news articles far back august warning “100 year virus” might coming. naive back I'm MA, arguably safest state right now, wife considering straight walking away teaching forge ahead filling school kids again. fear. can't kill us all. most, all. Definitely all, hope. Spare me, please. Pretty please ... Many areas protests, including NY, Chicago, DC, etc.

No discernible spikes cases locations, even though people definitely infected protesting.  1 5 American parents worry coworkers would think took time care sick children. guess says all. Doesn’t matter. They’re telling us people still aren’t listening. wouldn’t complied months ago either Want slightly used high school English teacher? Lol lookin wrong models 
Model Herd Immunity? Look Sweden 
Model lock containment? Look S. Korea , Taiwan, Thailand Except is. hope goes meets trump trump gets corona think it’s lab techs lazy weekends. don’t wanna work. Idiots, morons, etc. 25 million? accurate?

That would make Iran, alone, nearly double current world-wide total number cases. Oh, see. Jordi Pujol always reminded Yoda... feel like always-look-at-the-bright-side kind jedi. Rural America get destroyed election.

Guess wins election? COVID-19 wins One day will... One day. Parodyparodyparody state second highest death rate per population right? model aspire to? I'm angry. Nice try, though. 147 countries, Sweden #5 ranking deaths per million. Spin that, Daphne live tourist area. Hotspots developing young people rafting boats together partying day long. go restaurants bars nearby towns. fuck??!? No, not. question whether anyone defending truancy laws free meals school still maintaining schools shut down. real hoot. real James Inhofe, tell ya. People permanent damage counted recovered  Senate pubbies also pushing back white house point. entered full shit show.  Fauci stooge. Don’t trust word guy says. care kids all. worried poor, old neighbors... 5x deaths/per day coming \*down\* peak compared peak states bashing extend Pandemic Unemployment Assistance economy tanks.

This far important, terrifying fact. economy house cards without constant spending- even destabilizing virus complete grinding halt commerce happen immediately CARES act expires. fucking idiot. true. Spain example suddenly started reporting low numbers changed methods. I'd rather worst numbers wrong numbers. already get back power get good old crippling austerity continued disastrous dehumanizing economic policies, better manners. I'm teacher, superintendent shared results yesterday parent survey:

- 55% prefer in-person start year
- 5% prefer remote
- rest undecided need time/info, clearly majority already. 

The next question was: ""How comfortable child returning school person?""

- 30% answered ""very comfortable""
- majority negative side

So, learn this? Parents give fucks teachers kids, long kids home. might well written in, ""get kids hair, figure shit out!""

I willing hear sides, even though know sure starting remotely phasing back in, that's even possible, that, know even factor parents want. parent myself, I'm beyond bewildered people either impatient, misinformed, dumb want course action, knowing even feel comfortable going back person. literally set lose/lose district teachers. learned, idiot charge state bunch dummies living here. don’t think “desperately need” anyone get seriously ill this. don’t care political views wishes ~~death~~ severe case deadly disease someone else? ashamed Unfortunately, way get pandemic together. Otherwise disease keep flourishing. individual can't really anything. need look other. take actions collectively us live normal lives over. I’m saying China give citizens choice. US basically operating honor system it’s going well. People opting stay in. ... are? Fauci president No, dental hygienist climb open mouth breathing employee next hour. beyond bizarre first months city. I’m glad slowly recovering weeks stick mind many others I’m sure rest lives. Non-American here. How's New York now? Depends take ? Greek mythology ? Art appreciation ? There's politician world reknown brain surgeon also believes earth 6k years old. 

Just highly educated single specific field able pass tests classroom setting mean still imbecile. Yeah, live OC man, bad. Everyone acting like life gone back normal we’re verge mass outbreak.  trying kill people. appreciate image showed droplets disperse based mask type. realize cloth masks stopped outward travel better N95 masks. Granted, lot water droplets released cloth masks, consider distance traveled argument picture.

Very interesting, thanks sharimg! federal government’s request, DHEC transitioning CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) COVID-19 module TeleTracking’s U.S. Healthcare COVID-19 Portal monitoring hospital bed occupancy data.  time, unable report number hospital beds occupied patients either tested positive investigation COVID-19, number patients currently ventilators. Im assuming becomes like flu person get lifetime. know people age I've barely left house months  
high risk boomer parents going daily, going restaurants, going pool parties. age thing. Plenty older people guilty too. I'm guessing war live peacefully. I'm fucksnorkel, cuntsuckingturdbucket. ""Good oral health reduces risk disease.""

No shit It’s required counties, it. need ass it. 

Frank Ward, spokesperson Texas Education Agency, said state won’t mandate use face masks, shields testing leave many decisions local leaders.

As past week, kids 10 required. flu R 1 normal circumstances. Seemingly amount social distancing would irradicate dont understand wants small badly. Exactly. Considering disaster tracing program UK government failed setting up, absolutely zero confidence ability actually enforce two week quarantine. suggestion, imagine visitors bothering it. dozens sections city rates 50% listed 

And I’ll go back previous point refuse respond NY second highest mortality rate world next NJ, think model worked used everywhere you’re dumb dumb full stop really stupid MLBs plan middle pandemic plan lol. disgusting specific group people controlling forcing others get sick, President want look bad horrible job doing. Wait, actually need someone explain care one? enemy American ideals enemy America. Lives sacrificed, money spent lost, replaced time; compromised, ideals gone forever. Ideals governments fight wars blood treasure, support humanitarian causes treasure compassion.

America become militaristic materialistic. longer idealistic sense. would take restore sense shared, greater good beyond me. think power union currently constituted.  Plus crushed economy reduced spend.  first time reading people catching covid 19 months apart. Looks like immunity last months. looks like even vaccine immunity last months? 

Just like catch cold multiple times year? True. New Jersey actually almost 1,800 deaths per million people. Also believes aliens talk him?
I think know cousin
(Edited autocorrect) distance, it’s becoming clearer clearer country raging dumpster fire run managed morons.

Oh, clear quite close up.  article mentions, combination large families, low income jobs higher risks taking proper Many immigrants large families eight 10 children packed tenements state’s cities. carpool work grocery store, wrongly believed virus would affect them. ""Lack competence"" softballing enormity crime committed. planned culling, genocide elderly economically viable. intentional. Texas Lt. Governor said, old people willing sacrifice good economy? That's real inside voice. hidden mics behind closed doors, probably hear lot kind talk. real sure number March Texas considering hoops person jump even get tested; figure wrong like todays wrong.
The state dragging feet shutting playing seriousness jumped reopen bandwagon.
Just like said.
Fools talk kids constantly. 😐 K-12 colleges. 

Scary stuff. point Look fucking dibshit’s face see value letting kids starve?   Kentucky new mask mandate place. Today went Walmart three employees standing entrance enforce mandate. guy walking ahead mask literally one employees told wear mask, guy huffed walked right inside.

Wish people would take seriously actually phase back normal lol Lack object permanence showing Seriously. Everybody could die NYC died, fled cities USA. joke? Yeah think I’ll take chances vaccine shit like 10 months points strains similar enough *should* good degree cross protection across board. here. Laid end March, position eliminated May. I'm aging 37 year old female IT, struggle enough COVID, insurmountable mountain climb. I'm rat race young males paid far less me, stigma female male dominated field. (The stuff I've endured another conversation another time.) already proven, study done already showing hiring women gone since COVID, meaning men women hired COVID.

I'm sitting wondering job/career learn now. Better Florida:/ give ideas. Even handicapped CDC better none all. US lower deaths per million several European countries? I’ve lived VT whole life. say there’s lot “aware people” live here. Even without mask mandate, generally see 70% Vermonters wearing masks. also helps population quite low size state too. Good see /rcoronavirus! Uh, yeah, matter, said was. feel free keep changing goalposts, I'll stop playing. Testing tracing, good adherence recommendations people, good leadership governor, 14 day quarantine visitors exceptions come counties low case counts. yet New York great it’s model.

Because got hit hard early basically STOPPED it. Meanwhile CA increasing end sight.

I mean really hard understand basic facts. come world reality, upside world.  also protects you. both. people saying next stimulus bill going pass week. I'm telling not. Democratic house wants funds literally everything republicans want funds go big corporations. Maybe next time America's stocks tank Sure. I'm sure CCP let roam around freely amd take photos everything.

I'll back 2035 US government negotiates prisoner exchange. I'm PA that's said Wolf. 

""This MFer must laying ground work presidential campaign"" works population. extremists right would rather believe conspiracies doctors (because they're too). can't convince crazy facts logic anything. Especially look incompetent president generations American history white pride. Literally Idiocracy, like dark Christopher Nolan reboot. Fuck elite rich. Let wait line like everyone else.   Trump dropped ball, Cuomo dropped ball. true, true. don’t believe that, you’re exactly what’s wrong discourse country. Fuck elite rich. Let wait line like everyone else. Well depends 50% means. assume mean makes half people take unable get covid. Couple masks, social distancing, immunity people previously sick...and virus trouble infecting new hosts. drastically reduce numbers...more cutting half.

That said, 50% effective could mean still get sick, severe symptoms. makes unpredictable. basically effective way handle coronavirus kill vulnerable population placing patients nursing homes. vulnerable population, death rate drops near 0. logic infallible  It’s fascinating see everyone’s gut instincts Birx part administration’s failure validated. fact, America one firsts get vaccine. bet one people equating COVID19 severity race ACE2 differences race early days know there's subreddit: r/NationalTeacherStrike

I've also barely begun creating another Reddit *general* strike hub matter innit. Still majority 👊 Ummm... NY highest death rate states? could wrong, checked stats lately.

Brought guy said masks help early on. perspective. think violent response public exactly want; like you, know puts us far do. 0\_0 Ethy talking facts. political people. NYC handled terribly. virus burned thru entire city. Finally getting coverage!  Hidalgo county 2% Texas population least 10% deaths surge. belongs hands CDC. What's point CDC take away them? COVID test (her mom 4 yo brother too, cried.) check DVT all! I'm upset worried her. DVTs joke. Clarence Thomas's wife posted Soros globalist conspiracy. It’s almost knows doesn’t worry re-elected. Almost plans stealing using gestapo enforce disappear anyone argues. F hopefully change week. safe (and I’m sarcastic, it’s genuine). required educate kids. quotation marks needed. opened back way early we're shitter Biking heat difficult. Still breathing, overheating. amazing much regulate temperature breathing never occurred tried mask. Okay. this. corporations, billionaires millionaires say want help. Fund programs then. Fucking easy. hope god gives strength need get this.❤ I'm ur aunt anti-vaxx. NSA definitely listens peoples phone calls government police agencies. Look prism. Snowden talked this. checks balances? Ohio cases deaths rise?! storm capital course mask-free rally masks. wait-lets bring assault rifles make political rally. 

Hey! That’s horrible idea. counter protest make also BLM protest!

Dammit Ohio! strong, wear mask, practice good hygiene, social distance safe. Sorry, disappointed watched today Columbus. love arguing ignorant people Reddit think NY somehow fucked up. Thank Fauci making providing sources argument much easier. mean look now? still getting hit hard Well, look, one who's talking truancy laws, clear think they're relevant. Quite clearly people see value feeding needy children, don't, can't really see much point discussing you. Probably trying accelerate virus point attempt delay election. sure else could smart elect bernie sanders example, handle pandemic listening science  Idk man, looks like Florida really gunning beat NY confirm, things done rightly possible completely perplexed happening elsewhere Oh good. correlational studies attempting prove causality methodologically-rigorous studies repeatedly shown masks don’t work.  say state?  Oh yes, killing vulnerable population fantastic strategy. Cause owners people power give big F U. sitting yachts enjoying life fans biggest suckers keep making ppl rich buying tickets, buying merch ppv. 

Stop making excuses. reason nfl, mlb, nba nhl multi billion dollar industry cause fans. fans sport NY 2 arms behind Italy, states like recs Florida got months northeast. Yes, projection way down.  know, speaking satanist, rituals lot fun putting dust mask grocery stores. Hand washing isn’t one rituals either. idiot. ""You mean got virus wearing mask!? That's stupid!"" fact it’s rushed

it rushed tho, cutting red tape. plus based past coronavirus vaccine. oxford based mers vaccine, 5 years testing behind it. shame. seems like good person. “Unfortunately, preferred send child kindergarten feeling Israeli ‘trust,’ fatally damaging important value ‘mutual responsibility’ ‘[Thou shalt not] stand idly blood thy neighbor’ [Leviticus 19:16],” Zalfreind wrote. “For me, longer matters contracted [the virus] violated isolation. beg ask grandparents, neighbors older uncles surround us deserve die, even preexisting medical “God forbid blame anyone.

Thank God recovering difficult stage disease already behind me. one person read things understood importance isolation restrictions - would rewarding. Really love every one you. big hug kids.” hospital work at?

Your reading comprehension struggling bit. Fiancee director on-demand nursing needs hospitals nationwide Given WFH since March everyday see hear fiancee working ass off

Her company organizes provides hospitals nursing needs based fluctuating week-to-week demand. constant calls email threads various hospital staffing management teams across southern California (her territory), well internal calls regional directors C-level execs. team specifically charge placing traveling per diem nurses work whatever hospitals need nurse willing travel/work in.

Hence work physically hospital like seem think, scope goes far beyond single fiancé works hospital didn’t know mainly work 12 hour shifts? Seems little odd.

Let's try again. top working hospital, never said know ""mainly work 12-hour shifts"". seem equating misunderstanding nurse (despite clearly never saying so) expected working hours three 12-hour shifts. stated, director healthcare staffing company. expected hours Mon-Fri, 9-5. past several weeks worked 11-12 hour days, including weekends, hospitals' demands continue surge luxury right working less hours else people's health wellness would directly affected negative fashion.

That said, let's talk compassion moment. Like said, knows job max right helping hospitals staff nursing needs, partially responsible preventing sick people getting care need. compassion others never met ever will. Throughout dialog seem set ""right"" stopped consider cost. Let's pretend right -- great, what?

Furthermore, think two statements clearly demonstrate complete utter lack 2 people passed away lot health problems 70 years thing New York good get rid elderly people. number one sure!!!

And what's endgame this? want assume, seem eluding whole pandemic intentionally overblown conspiracy sorts. accurate?

And final question you: feel wearing mask public? Keep calm wear mask! First-past-the-post gerrymandering. Funny can’t even respond facts, reveal horrible person are. feel really bad you, definitely need help friends Testing positive twice necessarily mean reinfection, doctors scientists seem agree sentiment, hey, let's listen hoaxoner. Based law, hospitals still hook many things arising crisis. lobbying hard right hook. put crisis waste? lobbying hard right keep electives open costs- even puts patients risk. 

They could foreseen this. Pandemic expects warned years. exactly healthcare ran business. Profits lives. 

Hospitals expecting government cover asses PPE. unethical profit businesses. privatize gains socialize losses. 

Yes, every hospital warehouse PPE events like rotate materials never expire. 100% reasonable practical. expect many adopt practices like point forward. 

Look man go day. Obviously think system everything right liable current outcome. think could better system place events experiencing right now. 

Yes apples oranges. can’t compare shooting people healthcare crisis. 

No didn’t sign this. You’re minority mindset. Yes signed help people pretty much us continue despite risk. said, go healthcare first world country certain standards safety expected. 

Calling HCWs hero’s soldiers event dehumanizing. didn’t sign die front line healthcare system government epically failed prepare inevitable, 100% predictable event people charge need pay price. 

Btw hospital exec something? I'm trying come Turkey Greece joke, I'm dimwitted. keeps might become next president Brazil. love leaders talk crazy stuff. Multiple confirmed round 2 cases - still early need wait peer reviewed studies. moment, it’s looking like there’s chance (at least people) 2-3 months, get again.

Either virus dormant re-activate, unlikely 100% proven get 3 months later — moves us beyond slow motion disaster.

One keep mind currently, probability get twice small. probability get currently around 1 : 100, probability get twice 1 : 10,000. So, 3 million cases infected once, would 30,000 cases infected twice, proportion people asymptomatic could higher.

However. could mean ""herd immunity strategy"" work.  point feel vulnerable without mask. I've anxiety dreams I've store without mask freak out. like forgetting pants dreams That's real possibility, fact form immunity antibody immune response may may protect someone, possibly brief window, top reinfection creating worse infection...having survived dengue, say inside little house bubble foreseeable future. 
Wouldn't nice ignorant? actually read article? Mask usage higher among Hispanic people white people, specifically idiot's state. known Sub due previous posts.  definitely gotten personal. I'm Sacramento know single person caught know anyone else knows someone who's caught it. pretty weird play xbox stream twitch  understand that, mean let people die nothing political. Cuomo biggest failure.

Yes, governing New York (mainly NYC) playing hard mode, instead shutting got dick measuring Contest Deblasio refused shut *days*, nursing home thing.

On top that, super vocal Trump supporting needing vents jazz, turns single patient turned away vent bed.

Cuomo politicized it. still is. really sickening he's seen good. no. Maybe human waste disposal facility fertilizer based napalm mixed one dumb ass decided light cigarette dropped match afterwards forgot put flame burned grubby little dick beaters, setting fire. right. looking Worldometer reports. harrowing trying keep daily totals tallies, I'd rather see big picture numbers graphs end day days later. really quite awful matter way cut it. make irrelevant definitely feel little hollow slogans like ""never forget"" disregard 140000 American deaths. 

Just seems like fake patriotism me. Nah, Republicans adults, theyre like drunk tweens. Even harder Americans. Europe doesn’t mean existential problems loosing job. don’t worry buy food children next month kill retirement plans. get it. Why? help anyone?  Naw, nobody tracking following 90% cases long enough designate recovered. Take look worldometer graph active cases compare new cases ... clear still cases 2 months ago books ""active"". That's obviously error corrected somehow. low cost piece mind sure! schools do/don't spread this? Lol @ windows wide open Montreal anytime past September. Starts tomorrow. Look Health Ambassadors black polos door. Can’t wait see it! one trying steal countries? Meijer even operate state hasn’t passed mandatory mask rules? I'm old enough remember president ok bounties American soldiers people thought might hurt image became known. Gerald’s optimism cute. Maybe store testing I’m democrat whole family ain’t singularly linked republicans.

Democrats power enough times make difference, even predatory pricing US Medicare progressive get through.

The issue lobbyists. It’s got point country broken never fixed. problem no-one lockdown county, let alone state stop people large gatherings private residences. 

The thing stop coffins streets like Italy. Excellent thank you. last years i've heard plenty phone conversations work places able find workers. arent great jobs, good ones.  area were, this, $15/hr jobs didnt require resume would train you. area every year couple foreclosures $25-$30k. got 3 bedroom foreclosure years ago work it. work month caught lot projects. grilled, cooked. ok. people know spent cars last years house cost - can't afford house. lot life make it. every area different.

Edit: didnt say $15/he great wage. said person didnt make plans make $50k $100k year make payment cheap house area. know houses cost areas. Even Russia CIS countries, Russian-made medicines seen second-rate compare Europe North America. Hey, thanks! Like said I’m expert, take lot stuff various vaccines development since I’m pretty anxious one. It’s easiest find stuff re: ChAdOx that’s I’ve got much detail there, someone that’s particularly great science, that’s understand all.

I wonder something similar could done filter inserts, could way sterilize reuse filters. one mentioned allowing older individuals decide want safety handled either.  That's still try avoid crowded places much possible. Maybe buying mask filter good idea all. hope go another lockdown.  Pull Donald Trump power.  **Abstract** 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory disease caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 characterized clinical manifestations ranging mild, flu-like symptoms severe respiratory insufficiency multi-organ failure. Patients severe symptoms may require intensive care treatments face high mortality risk. Also, thrombotic complications pulmonary embolisms disseminated intravascular coagulation frequent patients. Indeed, COVID-19 characterized abnormal inflammatory response resembling cytokine storm, associated endothelial dysfunction microvascular complications. date, specific treatments available COVID-19 life-threatening complication. Immunomodulatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine interleukin-6 inhibitors, well antithrombotic drugs heparin low molecular weight heparin, currently administered benefit. Ozone therapy consists administration mixture ozone oxygen, called medical ozone, used century unconventional medicine practice several diseases. Medical ozone rationale COVID-19 possibility contrasting endothelial dysfunction, modulating immune response acting virustatic agent. Thus, medical ozone could help decrease lung inflammation, slow viral growth, regulate lung circulation oxygenation prevent microvascular thrombosis.

**Keywords: COVID-19; cytokine storm; endothelial dysfunction; immunomodulation; medical ozone; ozone therapy; ozone; SARS-COV-2; virustatic** Trump want give raises dishonest organization makes sense.

Lol, no. issue would rather keep giving money cronies Trump companies (something like $17 million know Trump companies since 2016). parents send child school following law, employers, President telling do. Schools reopening work saying they’ll fired don’t show up. 

Place blame it’s due, minimum-wage people trying avoid starvation homelessness. Yes!! Yea sorry there's enough moisture coming normal person's breathing pattern dangerous. someone smokes vapes push air forceful way. akin breathe cold weather. Take note.of far moisture goes. Unless taking deep breathe gross person long people stay away want normal situations anyway danger.

That said vocal issue talk low. wear face covering makes essentially mute. ok talk much anyway. need talk people able read lip movement aids able tell I'm saying. also anxiety panic attacks usually makes get psychogenic fever feel like can't breathe. something block airway last thing needed situation. medical exclusions state PA. 

There many medical conditions make ""minor incovience"" people. see someone like STAY AWAY. want near anyway. 

Otherwise go ahead attack people mental health conditions. I'm sure work favor. end next victim assault deserved it.  twitter(at least sosmed popular) post hashtag local trustworthy company news, influencer people india, etc. saw search ""covidiot india"" people india post news/video that, looks like citizens using twitter *It seems they’re human commander* guys symptoms. medications give? Arlington County, VA ruled person classes Fall last week.. make masks, check Filti. bought material put masks. mask tests I've seen done tested provides greatest protection homemade materials. Breathes really well too.

ftfy, comrade. don’t know long term problems cause children young adults. may don’t get sick, it’s irresponsible poker health entire generation corporations want employees back. assume correct current summer weather *is* actually slowing down, shit gets scarier.  Yea shame country’s genocide 1 million Iraqis Immunology/Microbiology suppose would pointless call police? Deja vu worth potential damage liver? sure liver function tests first 6 months every year sure tolerating it. 
I watched lot House stayed Holiday Inn Express. go Walmart North Charleston, SC yesterday afternoon. definitely *not* enforcing mask rule. Texan muster response headline Napoleon Dynamite style, “luckyyyy...” expertise hospital? nursing home deaths skewed numbers big time. Still terrible deadly virus, taking numbers. learning lesson time slaves without paid sick days take off. However people paid sick time still come point Supervisors responsibility send home pay. Schools absolutely reopening unsafe circumstances (the US currently facing record numbers new cases) epidemiologists infectious disease experts saying months, even amidst pressure Trump's administration force CDC change reopening guidelines, block director CDC testifying Congress dangers schools reopening, threatening cut funding schools reopen despite danger.

There ways feed teach children result explosion virus increased infections among children, teachers, parents.

There logical argument made favor in-person schooling expense people's lives. thing redditors right, country (or say ""my country"", I'm living see shit inside, huh?) still unable create even decent flu shot, let alone serious drugs. pharmacy total disaster. there's way want get particular covid-shot, matter ""pro-pro-vaxxer"" are. Hard prove anything. yes, probably. still see people taking off, putting chin. They're slacking believing knowing kind people struggling get help us need forced.

 rational discussion simply decided problem give goddamn someone else's fears. They're chock-full bullshitt even listen others majority people going ERs actually real proper emergency. they'd arriving ambulance. probably also specific saying would go 15 cases zero, would first go $3.78 million still counting cases $142k still counting deaths first. Thank god infect parents, bus drivers, teachers, people supermarket, older kids breaks, playgrounds /s They're tracing 70% contacts. target 80% according SAGE - could better hardly disaster. liberal socialist nazi

Pick one please. Facebook got it. stupid argument doesn’t hold water. 

CNN reported “119% capacity” yesterday. simple google search newspaper away.

Edit: [from July 7th. mention two number guys keep mentioning. Almost like ones using reason downplay severity Florida outbreak rest world measuring total ICU capacity Flordia reached half total ICU capacity ten days ago. 2: [seems like elective surgeries aren’t thing either. dozens articles local papers local hospitals stopping elective surgeries they’ve reached capacity. Again, mention two different types capacity. almost like things aren’t measured way 3:[elective surgeries already reported becoming limited 20 days ago. anyone’s measure, available measured capacity one measure hospitals ability handle Covid patients. take on, hospital dedicated general procedures shut down. like happened NY. know want show Yale degree stupid argument. channel News goes depth, although tangentially. essentially weaponized racism.

There consistent effort bind measure social state welfare with, essentially, subsidizing proliferation minority criminality. 

Each reforms even mild measures consistently framed giving black people means follow natural tendency become lowlives. think design, design doens't mean impulses incentives behind horrifically evil. Maybe makes even  personally suing mayor Atlanta mandating masks ""closing businesses."" Note last part sentence lie business guidelines simply recommendations. And? Wow, actually pretty useful predicting future outbreaks.  neighborhood Brooklyn 76,000 people. Yes! ton masks, new earloop cloth one day ear loop mask regular work days, since required wear hospital's provided earloop surgical masks clock. wouldnt recommend anything vent, forces unfiltered droplets mask, defeats purpose!

I'm commuter long walk train job. wear cloth mask commute stow brown paper bag locker bag working. keep work mask/paper bag lab coat day. leave work, switch masks wear cloth one home toss work mask. 

 reuse cloth masks multiple days like do. reason bunch like wear day toss laundry. get pile throw lingerie bag wash hottest setting. this! amazing mention this. describes our. situations fatal. Insane. universal healthcare plan admission leaves 10 million people uninsured bad system. Fauci can’t guidance it’s suits ignore interferes memes. he’s saying isn’t logical it’s actually understandable. 40 ish guy, know would done would now. I’m risk adverse (it comes age) asked young people give ton freedom fun relatively low personal consequences. Younger people adventurous risk taking. That’s is. might get back affecting I’m going hold young person accountable standard wouldn’t conformed age. That’s selfish hypocritical part. Duh. title butchered...read again. must live 2 doors me... supposed ignore protests riots glorified media? I’m going touch first point-but, definitely ways deal second point

Some districts creating food pick ups families still receive meals

Some states added snap benefits. 

There bunch ways address societal ills schools alleviate don’t require school session Agree former VTer family still back there. one person remarkable compared rest country. see high 50% non masked stores live. might made serious mistake... difference: N95 mask filter filters air breathe IN. consequence harder breathe also protects anything floating around. doesn’t filter outward infected breathe particles open. 
The surgical, paper cloth masks easier breathe don’t protect well N95. whole paradigm masks helping centers around fact many possible wear basic masks keep droplets spits themselves. it’s wearing cloth mask surrounded virus spewers - mask won’t help much (N95 would). wear masks, protect much reasonably can. go store - wear simple cloth surgical mask. corona swabs 5 hours day - wear N95 more. ear wax clogging ear sucked vacuum. told insurance covered paid 20ish co-pay. Got sent bill $300. years back sorry nations US introducing democracy to, however - sorry Americans gettting totalitarism introduced, least seems like rest world catching break.  Biden, Lincoln Project, everyone else needs become unified chorus message coverup, Trump China did. Beat drum loud, 24 hours day make story. work fiberglass insulation regular basis. like wearing mask, potential lung damage far outweighs objection could have. Hell yeah that’s good hear drunk saw article exactly opposite headline like 'Friendships relationships improves COVID-19 lockdown' couple days ago? must seatbelts, smoking sections like. People world fighting ACTUAL freedoms inconveniences processes infantile Brain weakness. I’m good oral. like saying president dying upvoted here... picked possible easily prove beyond reasonable doubt. enough sway Republican senate, course, facts pussies.   Beautiful amazing state full worst people humanity offer. Some, assume, good people.   Oklahoma governor caught Oklahoma? There's likely enough hospital footage outside US show severity disease. Americans criticized living bubble ignoring rest world though, seems that's really glaring case... Went supermarket Mrs today - easily 75% people wearing mask. see happens next week it’s officially “must wear mask” uk death rate 1.5% get that’s 4.9 million easy moralize try shame me. school system hard work pay substitutes money people available would game changer. many schools substitutes. puts extra pressure us. teacher 30 kids suddenly class 60 coworker calls out.

 Also, procedures place call many sick days beyond allotted written up. actually prevent getting raise keeping job getting promoted. 

There culture needs changed within school system people communicate things. Even assistant call meant losing pay coworker would tell hard care kids without me. subs assistants. even right thing call deal that. 

 would also say different calling sick pandemic versus pandemic. pre pandemic world great. pandemic world stakes obviously lot higher. 

But yes easy moralize someeone across Internet. Unless teacher convenient say people feel guilty lived life. 

 Part reason want schools open yet school systems seemed found solutions issues pandemic world. consider resigning take care unborn child walking poverty without insurance pregnant. Teachers often weigh lot things make decisions easy. Obviously extra cautious pandemic change many things.  silicone porous making accumulate dirt things?

Besides there's already masks like called respirators search one P2 filter buy cheap Chinese crap.

For info masks there's YouTube channel think called ""weaponsandstuff"", British guy talking respirators  Hahah agreed. sudden lost nicotine cravings lost mine. media lies Look, give Florida, Georgia, others little time cook books they’ll right Vermont! profession? Aaaaaaaand HD plan enforce loss life, liberty, pursuit justice see Darwin Award coming...  believe study said kids don’t spread based school older kids, 13-16ish, followed safe practices like masks, distancing, hygiene. also re-evaluate friendships. sucks. I'm guessing meant like herpes hopefully come back. chickenpox come back shingles herpes believe.

So question could help understand compare something like malaria? says caused DNA parasite encoding RNA. I'm basically hoping could give ELI5 version similar. know malaria come back, assume parasite dies comes back encoded RNA?  “How fix problem *undesirable* poor people”

Without that, would done amazing. need make pile changes there. terms general population, Canada pretty well. agree though, could better. Idk don’t really believe say anymore

Please downvote me! know that's happened... Kind makes like want say there’s also problem opposite way thinking. Excuses I’ve heard kids parents missed school include: get hair done birthday weekend; needed Child help print something; woke late figured wasn’t worth bring last five hours day; go shopping school trip; didn’t know wasn’t school today. Many parents think it’s big deal miss school little reason, also assume (chronically absent) kid missing significantly days kids (even it’s patently untrue). 3-12 weeks accepted range currently. deaths rise.  election vote out, done. playing different end game. ever PRC?

They're lax time random spurts enforcement. made competition. Chinese tourist want see NY?

I've dentist twice last week, first time ever going 17 years, given mouthwash swish &amp; spit 30 seconds came near mouth. face $10.2 million buys lot Sharpies. majority Americans (53%) said infected knew someone infected COVID-19, it’s becoming widespread passing day. 

Whoever circle advising blithering idiot thinking Americans going forget pandemic exists Election Day. didn’t know anything real history America base of

Back March, American Health Care Association told Cuomo, Wolf, Murphy etc stop ordering infected patients nursing homes. governors ignored AHCA forced nursing homes accept COVID patients. even made rule nursing homes allowed test people murdered elders nursing homes.

How exactly ""correct""??? feel like living twilight zone. least inanimate object would actively try sabotage effort. 7 day moving averages disease killed everyone already month ago. look deaths per million total shall we?

And everywhere else already lockdown time. Stimulus checks issued everyone everyone locking down. Yet somehow state deaths compared nation factor 3 right thing! deaths way down, cases ever Las Vegas Casinos opened. Im moving Vermont vaccine invented Let guess old already sick? breaking news. Including sending sick patients old folk homes? According COVIDTRACKING, lot hospitalization data currently jacked bunch states. 

Something switching way report yada yada  Well, there's death rate, that's going too. biggest fear this. want pass friend family member outside live with. supposed visit mom tomorrow went girlfriend's graduation party last weekend one wearing mask probably 100 people took dinner. want go visit mom stepdad able forgive caught spread them. mom recently diagnosed breast cancer (removed small tumor expected make full recovery) COVID last thing needs right now. Yup. agree. held outside I’ve yet see Hispanic wearing mask. Live NC. Statistics based science say there's 99.8% chance even kids get COVID, recover w/o ever needing hospitalized.

But sure, continue wishing worse kids politicians agree with, ""progressive"".

EDIT: apparently, providing scientific facts cause downvoting someone, really? That's really anti-science behavior, folks. Wow, guys shut they?

""Better remain silent thought fool speak remove doubt."" Saw people walk passed security get mellinium park mask on, lower 10 seconds later. long public school whole day... opinion could considered non hypocritical. insane thing Trump still time turn around election. don’t even need figure do. countless countries set example laid framework that’s demonstrated successful past 3 months. crisis like could one best things basic competence willing adapt strategy rather doubling refusing admit wrong. It’s hurricane map sharpie people dying time. definitely don’t want Trump win November boggles mind administration isn’t shifting gears aggressively get front pandemic try make show strength working stop it. Betting sweeping carpet people ignore hundreds thousands deaths come November completely insane illogical. don’t get it, maybe I’m still playing 2D chess. thinks it’s fake? Go it. Honestly it’s first time I’ve ever felt way. Realistically, countries well containing this. Even China billion people. United States much. 

I see long term hygiene people washing hands often, see people wearing masks long term? Social distancing long term? implemented stop spread worked well. Obviously voluntarily, vaccine, see getting much attention afterwards like every day media now. 

50% based FDA approval criteria basing question off. Right now, pretty much maxed awareness social distancing get imo. Cases rising drastically. 

Do need make greater strides treatment virus? 52 times deadlier flu. 100 times deadly people preexisting conditions. I've read certain age groups preexisting coverage 10% more. beat one year, get next years, sounds like heck struggle. Burlington, real city, super liberal, air tight mask wearers.

Thanks showing NY state reach 1000 deaths! NY reach +10,000 cases testing around 25,000 people day, unlike CA/FL testing 80k-120k day similar case numbers. 

I guess states cause death nursing home patients like NY/NJ virus slows lol. Stop deflecting, facts data regarding pandemic clearly gone head. Maybe it’s reach APUSH, you’ll able understand. worth noting second infection dengue make much sicker well. getting vaccine infection (second exposure virus) make children sicker. point aspects dengue specifically make likely, generalize vaccines kinds viruses quickly ""Case count matter, hospitalizations."" 

Where next? Since March. Gotta beat China’s GDP Hey, rest world(Besides Brazil) actually coming back listened experts act like fucking children asked something people country. want anyone dead NYer I'm glad dunk moron. Here’s thing: unintended mess ups intended. That’s part reason they’re this. true. children able identify symptoms anxiety complain physical symptoms stomach ache, headache nausea.  Plenty large cities west coast. LA compared NYC, instance, similar amount cases.. 5x many deaths. LA #2 airport US ton visitors Asia.

NYC disaster I'm NYC anything weekly grocery trip 3am nobody else would 2 months. feels like wasted effort since can't really open back rest country going. erring side caution....good idea...stay well~ Counties yes, first I’ve seen entire state say fuck day. Live here, never seen massive shift life. fucked early corrected best way could. movie president recruit smartest man alive help country. Way better. wearing surgical mask even hard though. N95s understand people whining (a bit) surgical masks like nothing.

when korea people shocked hear people wear masks US flu season. courtesy others. 

but people like 'ITS DANGEROUS BREATHE CO2!!! KNOW LONG TERM EFFECTS BREATHING GERMS!!!' Yeah do, east asia, they're much better us now. ever Florida? He’s exactly governor you’d expect have. Ok governor shocked get STD sex hooker without condom. strip many casinos fall jurisdiction. still pile crap tho know whats funny? Trump's highest approval ratings March looked like trying something pandemic. fights acknowledgement it, approval ratings sink.

He's special kind stupid, he? Average years life lost COVID-19 US 10.8 12.4

Anyways, went drive test today. either way I’ll know soon put worry family ease either way.

All best recovery man. wish could say more, knows future holds right now. sorry we're broke let people die, im afraid can't much (lol also sigh) Connecticut Rhode Island stopped reporting weekends weeks ago. automatically assume flu?  It’s already reported pandemic disproportionately affects communities color. It’s Republican wet stabilized since killed elderly. we've moved shooting black people giving shit. Oh, paint giant message street there's racism. mean need emergency room generally position calling ahead lmao wtf. Agreed actually think trump realizes chance winning point either suppress turnout dramatically (by letting virus explode, thus scaring people voting) able declare Marshall law invoke emergency powers due raging pandemic.  always I've heard friends Germany seems like everything still slow

My colleagues traveling Germany Italy vacations now. business trips countries well. home office mostly, that's ok people. Offices enforce bigger distance people. Public transportation enclosed spaces lot people require wearing masks. everyone disciplined though, fines lockdowns fail contain seeing cases rural Germany now.

I consider opening religious services idiotic mistake German government. that, new cases usually tight factories, still better factories find Sweden seems said ""fuck yolo"" whole thing.

Yeah, talk Sweden easier government motivate people wear masks

You forget idiots assholes. need Asian, scientist medical doctor realize new cases started popping February Europe, people need least reduce unnecessary risk. However even China seeing people spitting elevator buttons spread saliva. assholes US people largely ignorant well... everything.

Yeahhh talk US either. What's point? Europe, watching shit show, would funny new, tragic source China sort safety checks new hospitals

Dude, making building different making vaccine, comes process release. course build something 10 days, ANYTHING building meant humans. takes time properly. Every idiot assemble walls together. However making infrastructure building ensuring safety regulations, whole different find lot videos YouTube talk hospital.

You also find videos wearing masks apparently bad. However, what's source info reliable it?  “Oh I’m sorry thought America!” - Randy Marsh Arizona checking in: *sighs envy 17 36 days infection report. 

Were nearing start then. Yep I've sent kids school light cough sniffles many times. Never fever, vomiting, diarrhea, bad cough anything like though. 

If kept kids home every time little cough sniffles would miss least quarter classes year probably half time winter. year I'll obviously keep home cases. might end home school anyways really can't go school ailment what's ever kind pointless even attempt public school. sorry hear that. feel like elderly New York State ignored. Well, one, longer need government tell us washing hands, avoiding sick people, avoiding crowds, wearing masks might good idea. us, anyway.

Truth is, even ""normal"" times, good advice. People yucky. :) dad (in NY) isnt bad hoax person. ""The masks dont work virus isnt even bad"". frustrating.

# Scientists identify six different types coronavirus increasing severity levels

Headache loss smell common six types found, grading meaning at-risk cases flagged up

[*By*Henry HEALTH SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT17 July 2020 • 8:14pm[Coronavirus Article Bar distinct types coronavirus identified scientists breakthrough promises save lives flagging highest-risk patients.

Analysis thousands cases artificial intelligence software revealed different ""clusters"" symptoms ranked order severity.

Headache loss smell common six groupings, range symptoms varies widely that.

Scientists King's College London (KCL) found patients sixth type Covid-19 nearly 10 times likely end needing breathing support patients first group.

This significant often patients deteriorate critical stage several days showing symptoms. new ranking system flag highest-risk cases give doctors opportunity intervene earlier.

[The six types findings, derived KCL's [symptom tracker used data 1,600 users UK US confirmed Covid-19. resulting algorithm tested independent cohort 1,000 users UK, US Sweden.

""These findings important implications care monitoring people vulnerable severe Covid-19,"" said Dr Claire Steves KCL.

""If predict people day five, time give support early interventions monitoring blood oxygen sugar levels, ensuring properly hydrated – simple care could given home, preventing hospitalisations saving lives.""

The least severe categories virus characterised flu-like symptoms, either without fever.

Gastrointestinal problems, diarrhoea, dominate third category, whereas fatigue, confusion ultimately respiratory problems associated increasingly severe fourth, fifth sixth categories.

[Coronavirus podcast newest team discovered 1.5 per cent people cluster one, 4.4 per cent people cluster two 3.3 per cent people cluster three Covid-19 required breathing support. 

These figures 8.6 per cent, 9.9 per cent 19.8 per cent clusters four, five six respectively. Nearly half patients cluster six ended hospital, compared 16 per cent cluster one.

""Being able gather big datasets app apply machine learning profound impact understanding extent impact Covid-19, human health widely,"" said Sebastien Ourselin, professor healthcare engineering KCL senior author study.

The study, published pre-print server called medRxiv, yet peer-reviewed. Amateur. Take good old microwave transformer. 2000V long way go Cuomo status. way...but 5k vs 33k deaths. Let’s make sure throw darts evenly. Yeah never lied. People making history. mom middle school teacher Illinois. seriously considering taking leave absence vaccine. building air conditioning, discourage people (particularly students) wearing masks. 

I suggested maybe district's teacher's union could something. next power district. unfortunate. CA company terrible sick time. Like get none. PTO little it. owner company takes dim view anyone taking time (except himself). accrue xx amount hours portions hours, depending long company. company minimum 5 years start accrue less pathetic amount. high turnover industry people sticking 5 years common. 

Because meager amount PTO given, absolute norm everyone come work sick. subtle shade thrown owner call out. God forbid baby young child gets sick need stay home, totally get shit talked upper management. do? come work sick. Every person company come work sick (myself included) one time another, many several times. open workspaces work groups sat together whatever illness du jour is, hopscotches office. one stays home sick owner company well son (also employee). really really sucks. even asked HR whole ‘Rona thing going on, thought given possibly either creating Sick Time possibly increasing amount PTO rate accrues. told decisive crisp “absolutely NOT.” Wow. 

If others work shitty companies like mine, crap attitude employees wellbeing, people continue opt send sick school age kids school often times can’t afford stay home. get weeks PTO year, one bout flu bad cold wipe out. happens kid(s) get sick you? cycle continues get exposed sick co-workers boat goes on. don’t know everyone else can’t afford get sick. know co-workers feel way too. miserable boat together....

EDIT - spelling &amp; format Inspect kid’s tongue weird Kawasaki look skin rashes catch early treatment works. Antibody tests reliable. Plus everyone develops antibodies infections, especially mild ones. TANGERINE DREAM TOLD FAKE!!! Nah, still going Fauci (literally) said dont need masks know joke, absolutely still bubonic plague...About 7 people per year US catch it, problem virus get rid simple antibiotics.  I'm right you. can't believe right now, people complaining freedoms taken away forced wear mask, yet silence point what's happening Portland HS (homeland security) acting secret police kidnapping folks streets. boggles mind. Sorry, get confused sub I’m in. lol

I come relax brain r/covid19 particularly like public transport still open weeks plan began. Subway cars filthy best days. sure kept open long. screenings even patient referred care, wait upwards 48 hours transferred over. 

uhh... ok. see, me, that's fixable problem. tell 48 hours insane shorten gtfo. honestly sounds like happened. 

There probably brief period time COVID patients hospital capacity. rest time, hospital patients could moved ship, require specialized machines. 

As far health insurance... want start long rant, remember back march balked paying COVID tests? got told were, uncertain terms. think could worked out. fled south Florida, look shit going  COVID deaths there's huge wave gun violence around city, culture basically non-existent people still staying inside homes businesses closed. Hundreds thousands maybe million still unemployed, public gatherings cancelled September (except BLM protests). Lots graffiti/boarded stores walk around, broken windows places. September 11th inspiring way everyone came together sense solidarity, people took pride city's resilience. polar opposite feels now. Everyone still wearing mask. It’s likely already hit 1 mill worldwide. didnt know that, good fact know, thank you! parent, feel blessed. school district, one option: online only.

We going struggle online education best can. understand teachers best practicing craft circumstances far outside comfort zone.

When pandemic over, children return classroom led highly skilled, experienced teachers knows school district values them. need booster shots likely. good news enough people vaccinated, slow R0 virus enough disappears becomes manageable.   Sorry, get confused sub I’m in. lol

I come relax brain r/covid19 haha guess sending covid-19 positive people nursing homes right move now? Guy died mask.. wear it... lol french inhabitant, definitely tell can't live without baguette. Yup got early get croissants (I'm totally typical French expect) wine hate him? vermont resident That's saying. think need release case notes ""could hit bus"" cases I'll believe bullshit. addresses ability ramp production flu vaccine. quite point COVID-19, given flu may never vaccine.

The useful playbook provided Obama administration ignored called evaluating threat preventing spread. could done January. Instead, Trump singing Xi's praises claiming whole thing hoax.

If US acted New Zealand chance, problem could kept minimum. ""Mark, feel knowing social media site created responsible spreading propaganda COVID-19? explain children responsible 99% misinformation pandemic?"" Massachusetts get love? didn’t vote governor Charlie Baker, done awesome job one seems mention that. source? look CDC, see death falling since mid April. I’ll admit, though, backlog death certificates could result increasing deaths allocated recent weeks - I’m discounting that. 

I’m saying authoritative data CDC, differs Johns Hopkins/CovidTrackingProject/Worldometer reporting, currently shows continually declining death rate. highlights CDC data differs sources: downvotes? don’t get sub.  Lol  Yep!! work healthcare numbers (I live NY state) still regularly putting COVID patients ECMO (a machine pumps blood outside body work heart lungs) ICU. ECMO joke lot people make machine. fact people think shit hoax, hurt (yes young) makes blood fucking boil. I'm glad got better man. hope continue stay healthy safe! Right? 

Facebook scrubs geolocation metadata every image upload. So, access it, who’s say aren’t compiling it? CT though Thank service. Republicans kind people learned something personally affected worst way possible. nothing new   massive protests good thing? Looks like thinking corona doesn’t exist good way get see things changing people face. appears worked UK take issue "" innocent naive""... Selfish irresponsible despite much prior warning serious risks far accurate. hahahaha Translation:


People belong risk group - may cancel trip Spain

Refers fact Ministry Foreign Affairs advise against

But work. Rolf's flight bus write that: “The advice Ministry Foreign Affairs must always considered basis dismissal. moment dissuasion Spain therefore regular conditions cancellation apply, ie registration fee unfortunately refunded. "" registration fee Folke Blechingberg wife total SEK 3,000.

Published 18 July 2020 21:04 mostly due rural are. largest population center(Burlington) shy 43k living there; whereas entire state total population approximately 624,000. ""Just like flu"". ""The heat kill summer"". ""They wanna use vaccine chip you""...

I'm sure there's more, let's hear them. Settle Ethel, lady back soup. Good idea wash hands (because probably touch light switches, door handles, etc.)...wouldn't hug anyone course. Stressful could get tested eventually. Wash dishes &amp; utensils....because maybe risk, sure....but, hopefully well!!!! still highly contagious virus. go lockdown come winner. go lockdown buy time put infrastructure place repulsive thing contribute. says much shouting primary way Coronavirus spread, think US would still world leader cases.  Nope, case Phil Scott Republican. Nice know might sane ones left. yeah put right next 'breathing'  think lot people interpreting comment ""who cares people die"".

But think intention more, ""No shit, open schools kill people"".

Am wrong? really hard tell comment. comment history makes think 2nd one. Hehe. ""Single dose"" California would instantly render common cold totally harmless understanding. cure also totally harmless, cure would bad disease now.

In practice, cures kind side effects though. yeah thanks Jay Leno boonies VT, coworker grew there. Pretty place I've gathered absolutely nothing happens NEK. wish people lump porn there, still stuck mindset American indoctrinations sexuality 'evil'. parts America produce porn California progressive inventive parts world, they're areas give America bad rep, fact reason America good rep, exporting best parts culture innovation around world. nations built genocide land conquest dont fix systemic racism problems discrimination perpetuating discrimination based different circumstances people born into. cannot control sibling child relative, banning someones ability something based birth ""fixing"" problem discrimination, perpetuating redirected subjective level (which terrible concerning cannot see case). long enough created different class discriminated against. havent fixed problem youve created different one. 

At point seems like support subjective discrimination don't, fundamental difference. daily testing decreasing considerably past weeks, believe not. 100k tests waiting analyzed. People waiting week get results. Everything consistently inconsistent Arizona. open space probably help lot, also sounds like Vermonters pretty good distancing mask-wearing, even times places mandated. 

It ain't perfect, course. year year ""non-Covid"" deaths 17%, significant number usually sign under-reporting Covid deaths ""unspecified pneumonia"" whatnot.

But accounts Phil Scott's done good job staying top actually taking seriously, probably important commonality among states better. lot coworkers bad shape, going meds drinking much, talking they’ve given humanity think world ending. 

And people still safely employed working home. 

I increased dose lexapro started. I’m still sad, I’m still worried things getting much worse, lexapro gets bad. Irrelevant. Mass crowding occured without large amount facemasks. government specifically enforced social distancing fined people social distancing meeting non-household members property, including outside.

Protestors werent fined despite packed like sardines. virus isnt in-door virus. Also correct I'm wrong torturing people hell wants damned eternity according bibke  think anywhere close herd immunity. people taking seriously - agree. 

Which means there's reason Florida Texas Arizona need surging - plenty evidence virus taken seriously.

You live BFE farmland. go county fair, watch high school basketball game inside gym - matter rural area - people come together spread take seriously. lockdown coming august september. Fun fact learnt friend days ago: America's % global prison population % global confirmed case count. kids' school district opening usual (with masks, certain situations), allow virtual learning kids whose parents want attending. kids choose virtual learning, allowed participate extracurricular activities elective courses offered virtually. kids seniors one take electives order achieve number credits needs graduate, really choice go person. kid vocational program interning local vet clinic half day, classes virtually. Regardless, one riding school bus. laid March, I'll driving least find new job (which happened yet despite efforts). 

Oh, district suspending contact sports football due COVID, apparently enough idiot parents fit, planning 'normal athletics season.' bullshit.

sucks tbh, funny though people protest mask guaranteed protection COVID-19, matter hive-mind Reddit believes. mask keeps virus spreading people already infected, considering people wear cloth masks (which studies shown used last resort) many people improperly wear surgical masks, efficacy masks drops significantly. [Freedom Vermont one places state motto really fits people live there.
￼ worries dude see mean. It’s hard care. I’ve lost much people assholes nobody seems give shit. It’s hard think “this probably won’t affect does, that’s bad luck, let’s go back life.” It’s right thing it’s hard think like constantly correct too!!! wore mask public. got reinfected anyway.

This line masks expected work. wearing mask lessened chances infecting others. understand bitterness *schadenfreude* high cases infections deaths American states , currently.

""It's simple math cases equal deaths"". 


Is really simple? dense? population younger people active outbreak localised there, surely spread faster among younger people death less death... less. 


COVID spreading among younger demographic cause ""spikes"" high death rate, know this.. known this. 


But downvoting someone feeling smart oversimplifying everything.

Look last graph [this page puts midpoint estimate total infected number 28 million, 8.5% upper bound 37.8 million 11.4%. Fermi estimate 13% isn’t far AI-generated model cited. 

I didn’t see “1.4% currently infected” number referenced - link show 8.4% currently infected. Link actual project crowdfunding started thinking came lot possible reasons. factors varying importance (and it’s possible importance) likely working together slow spread.

1. states locked longer harder many states. helped get cases low gave officials better knowledge highest risk thanks results states (like outbreaks bars).

2. reopen reopening clear downward trend cases. case AZ, TX, CA many states struggled reopenings. Sure percent positive still falling states, still, known reopening dangerous territory.

3. Face masks legally required NJ states time.

4. NJ 0.18% population 0.12% recorded died virus. average person states likely knows people either directly indirectly (say, coworker’s father) died virus became severely ill it. likely makes many people less likely reckless, although never know people.

5. Northeast cooler areas country, limits AC use lets people spend time outdoors.

6. lower case baseline makes testing efficient contact tracing possible, helping keep cases increasing.

7. states Democratic would thus fewer people falling Trump’s nonsense.

8. states probably don’t herd immunity sense everyone could go back normal lives without virus making comeback, probably enough people already infected help keep virus check since measures place.

9. US may far enough virus trajectory population density becomes less relevant. many reports crippling outbreaks rural communities (eastern Oregon Texas near Mexico border instance). Eventually epidemics/pandemics become endemic checked. case endemic disease anyone anywhere easily get infected. don’t live city get flu, instance. really second guess anything FMLA 12 weeks every 12 months.

On Thursday afternoon, message came Danish authorities many sides Sound longed for. Saturday, free people Skåne travel Denmark. Elsinore, joy palpable news.

- instructions figures clear, states mayor Elsinore, Benedikte Kiaer. Skåne's infection rate covid-19 far required authorities, people Skåne finally visit us Elsinore again. Without reservations.

An exuberantly happy mayor stood outside town hall Stengade. announcement Danish authorities Scanians welcome back Denmark Saturday 11 July certainly expected nonetheless long-awaited.

Severely affected border closure

When Denmark closed border due corona pandemic mid-March, Elsinore North Zealand one regions affected quickly mercilessly. Swedes could cross strait, many shops restaurants became almost completely without customers.

In four months since closure, companies forced close close down. Others barely made it. Mayor Benedikte Kiaer Elsinore looking future confidence.

- really missed company Swedish neighbors exchange across northern Sound. Saturday feast day. offer guests coffee pastry, first probably also little Old Danish, says Benedikte Kiaer.

Updated July 10, 2020 5:56 p.m.

Published July 10, 2020 5:30 p.m. high school automatically failed class missed 5 days class. Looking back, absolutely absurd. Fake news or, best, initial false positive maybe rare anecdote. Fact is, widespread re-infection observed. importantly, article even speak point person becoming infectious second time (cf. infected).   Dad treated coronavirus patients funny someone accuses ""deep state"". dude pediatrician wears cartoon characters make patients feel better think guy part evil conspiracy?

Of course Republican laws father law sick. Ud figure would encourage masks, help cover piss smell have. nah mean active cases historic  next iteration responding exactly feedback. This.

I'm lucky. cancer surgery delayed two months coronavirus cases subsided hospitals could perform elective procedures again.

I say I'm lucky cancer slow moment looks like harm done waiting. everyone fortunate enough something wait. Yeah there’s ton around central Gulf coast. think rebranded parent company, SE Grocers bullshit forced narrative. “young person” going around thinking “boomers didn’t take seriously, we’re going say fuck go party”. Young people average taking seriously start. Young people aged 18-40 represented majority cases start summer full swing, increasingly continuing disproportionately represent lion’s share new cases. 

The truth people selfish fuck nothing generational stereotypes. Young people don’t care consequences supposedly won’t affect much, galaxy brain revenge scheme boomers. excuses bad behavior zoomers/millennials absurd. also heard effect children, except studies coming effect children, getting infected, worse news making be.

Genuinely interested. sources? SoCiAlIsM CoMmUnIsM Thought r/nottheonion second  Lol, people actually responding ""well numbers florida made up"". 


This clearly political..  


How tonnes comments saying ""give cuomo slack"" hemming hawwing nursing home. 


But literal low effort comment chain calling Desantis ""Deathsantis""... 


That's literally contrary reality. protected nursing homes, Florida less deaths, greater population people old people, every metric much better managed balance negative effects lockdown opening earlier better results, sparing overdose deaths, mental health, ruined livelihoods.

&amp;#x200B;

But people autopilot.. Georgia bad, georgia ""human sacrifice"" look actual numbers true. Look Florida numbers, nowhere near New York deaths, even close, truly wonder astroturfing subreddit, refuse believe people tribal could stupid. think biggest problem , lots people successful gotten wealthy known wealthy people turn helped become wealthy ....  


That nothing virus except help make sure get best treatment still get sick like person understand virus equal opportunity. Boriiiiiing Sweden even close done. number people immune Stockholm, harderst hit city Sweden, unlikely level immunity much higher 20-30%. Besides, immunity wanes cases people infected months.

Other parts Sweden hit hard all. unless caring someone either symptoms.

Otherwise, there's point wearing home outdoor spaces social distancing possible. UK everyone gets free health care P US. right thing mask use likely gradually increase. bankrupt times days year  E K mean hindsight? We've known since 1918. Guess sending numbers straight White House make go away mild? member chicken pox, sob kicked ass. Guess I'm good. Well happening. Along rest America.  kind oil take? Massachusetts it’ll 98 degrees F tomorrow. A/C exists public spaces many homes. don’t understand virus 99% survival rate caused less deaths past years flus taken level. good time consider nationalizing companies Explain MI lol I’m moving VT! India. Seems impossible survive 2020 Awesome thanks ton!  friend mine positive covid asked get tested 14 day isolation told testing limited. still pass coronavirus contact bodily fluids? Also, Mayo Clinic, one best hospitals world, limited testing smaller hospitals even manage? federal government secret police occupying Portland, OR; so, it’s reality—not image. actually wear mask socially distance. I've hiding basement months now. Excellent work. new. universities secondary education closed Sweden - going while. Courses gymnasium universities taken online fall. 

There difference adults actual children. new facepalm learn that, since everyone ingrained horror touching faces Probably not, news fake selectively use footage time fit story want tell. manipulation fit story they're trying sell you. deceptive, also normal, going get people riled up. important part people followup question: trying make real story dramatic really was, making up? Like telling Pompeiians volcanoes didn’t break today. South Australia going like 90+ days 0 Community Transmission Covid. state Victoria hand, daily 300+ new cases. Scared spread us. India law provides exception sanitary health reasons...always did. great point. Attendance correlated better performance scores wish allowance missing even days without penalized. opinion 97 plus percent time still considered perfect gives little leeway sick. 

 Maybe would better schools give prizes certificates students miss less certain percentage school rather ""perfect"".

 want incentivize students come really hurt they're absent much want extreme push make unhealthy choices listen bodies. reasonable. comment pure ignorance everyone upvotes ashamed. utterly normal disease transmission rates vary among populations. Nobody knew results study might performed. presedent spoken yet? Holy shit aren’t kidding ""But Sweden zero collateral damage.""
- talking about? economy going shrink least 5.3%, denmark - country lockdown. 

And over. countries able return full speed open borders, sweden still dealing covid ravaging population, citizens continue banned entry nations.

You trolls beyond delusional rooting SARS. Honestly, hope there's special ring hell waiting trolls push death others. gut-feelings actually based scientific evidence?

Why read [actual Yeah, now, death rate 10%. fear second wave long reopening.  NY mortality rate compared states shamed shows what's what. Fucks sake. Trump supporting Dad lives outside Pendleton even though two nurses family, I'm sure that's enough. top that, recently heart attack gets it, slim chance surviving. outside America, Republicans want kill post office end voting mail. Republicans want voting mail Republicans voters mostly old people work day stand line election day. Young people vote Democrat work election day (which holiday here). Republicans also oppose making election day holiday increasing number polling locations extending polling hours (for reason). harder vote, Republicans win. strategy years. Olsterholm said 5 8% infected tempting fate driving car. Many times kids died car accidents this. obviously good job. bit panic US might encourage people take seriouly mear masks increase physical distancing. virus control too, probably make difference. uk. heartbreaking. confirm. We've new cases day week. 2 weeks ago tiny village held annual ~~drinking party~~ field days, specifically saying masks required. wonder could called that. topic thread? Remember them, ""I like either one vote"" group people landed us mess. even small number voted, mess federal response whole shitshow. Well would anyone buy buy slightly larger way better model 3M group people can't stuff huffing farts scientists understand bad anecdotal evidence is. Mate, ex-meatheads GI bennies consistently among chillest down-to-earth Americans I've ever known!

Hope attitude becomes infectious Covid, 'cause sound cool. Good luck there. Teachers also this. lot social pressure us go work still ill. feel guilty taking day even coughing lung. 

Around late February got sick. exactly around time Coronavirus started discussed nationally, although state yet knew about. remember feeling torn whether go in. went in. took 2 3 months get better. :/ idea cold something more. that’s good people wearing masks taking seriously. one area is.  haha whyyyy, reason surely financial difficulties Fauci says downplayed masks make sure masks medical professionals. consider lying. That's cool helmet didn’t “expect” anything different, also certain getting result.

It perfectly plausible hypothesize young people would spread virus effectively older people, given infections much less severe. know case.

This represents significant advance understanding pandemic. makes sad scientifically ignorant comment getting many upvotes. people really know difference armchair speculation scientific data? Also former Vermonter. Born there, siblings longer live state. dad still there.

There reason Vermont 314,120 1850, today might break 650,000.

Meanwhile US went 23 million 328 million.

Crazy Vermont doubled population US multiplied 14 times.

edit: grammar  People going come back dead vote November. Make America great again, right? tone may light-hearted helpful deserves downvoted principle.

If works out, course would wonderful diagnostic tool. imagine would offered option many would take nose swab.

I also worry many people would pass offer would feel like potential exposure regardless actual safety. often miss tendency people irrational. especially true talking fear contamination. I'm engineer advocate importance duty educating public large anything produce.

Again, apologize tone took. would care look graph proven got control. People need realize lockdown bring cases controllable level, solve problem forever. Statistics???? Source instead downvoting like cowards are? shut 2018, never concentrating camps hysterical twat. Keto diet cure case. among many others

This uncommon thing. Federal law demands receiving state accept patients asked (if there's room course) dont say mean all. ever life changing moment make people honestly look weight decide time really change covid ..i understand exact science weight makes covid deadly .I suppose could flu get reported much. get overweight healthy insane deadly becomes catch covid. positive thing come covid would hope could people getting serious managing weight. Sucks see family lose 2 daughters vans Walmart. say it, yes know cold gets, man needs ski. believe 70% needed herd immunity, given communities suffer mass death, seems like rather good news. educated folk type (or shouldn't) believe everything read hear.

So saying people think COVID hoax highly educated?

There's big difference healthy skeptic conspiracy theorist, even though ""don't believe everything read hear."" think latter missing ability distinguish reasonable ridiculous (Occam's Razor Hanlon's Razor tend help here). part likely correlated education level, even far universal (see: stories nurses even doctors declaring COVID hoax). frustrating thing Florida swing state powers would love potential voters opposing party leaving state. Welp, deleted account. expected. Fake bogus friend asked, anybody know rules face masks rain, advice? Thanks. wear mask, sanitize, stay away people, fine  So, first comment article (at time simulated droplet dispersal heavy cough using different types common work COVID healthy, serve purpose.

&amp;nbsp;

Fucking morons, tell ya. Proviging links paywalled press reports without links original studies meaningless. Wow. guy recommends injecting bleach one time suddenly trust vaccine? Ups bad State wide there’s less ~150 active cases.  Yea is, secret selfish sack shit Oh dear, America. 

Where'd go wrong (rhetorical question, know went wrong) first time I’ve heard kids dying exercise wearing masks. Kids dying sports undiagnosed heart respiratory issues sadly unheard of. I’ve never heard mechanism could cause masks lethal. real issue answer would enough production proper N95 masks populations. Manufactured masks lot easier breathe homemade cloth masks. kids skip PE. However we’re six months knowing pandemic real deal still can’t produce enough PPE inexcusable reasons. 

CDC dealt several potential pandemics novel viruses lifetime reasonably well. first one CDC’s advice match scientific literature. Granted follow others closely didn’t to. always going tough virus many developed countries controlled much better they’ve closed borders us control here. catastrophe 100% preventable.

There safe answer open close schools families poverty need childcare. poor lose either option. would love leaders take schools poverty mitigation role. absurd schools inherited task ensuring kids basic needs met (to make learning possible). everyone basic income (at least pandemic, beyond) schools could narrow focus education would greatly simplify decisions poor families would freedom decide like rest us. 

The last study saw decade ago consistent 95% scientists supporting one party. also scientist part 95%. don’t feel viable second option choose from. wish did. party consistently attacks scientific institutions science political. Science political. Reality doesn’t care beliefs. is. I’m used governments slow adopt established science, actively trying go backward much worse. Ignoring we’ve learned centuries scientific experimentation results shit like economy shutting can’t control pandemic. standard belief amongst field effective. welcome /s can't get air bnb save life. 

Unless you’re NY, apparently. 

In town 500, bet know person renting Airbnb’s NYers. Call let know feel it. internet kind screening

It's called Facebook. attracts dumb people. makes people dumb, figured yet. Thanks great website! bookmarked it. 

 read article New York Times said kids 10 years older transmit virus much adults. Therefore elementary school teachers might little bit better situation. However middle school high school teachers probably larger risk. still scary even elementary level. 

I really feel business owners. amazing people sit restaurant enjoy food. would creeped appetite. imagination would visualize little virus particles floating air plate. 😅 neurosis saves lives... 

 one semi risky thing. partner wanted ice cream July 4th weekend. one ice cream shop except worker mask on. took cup top increase chance touched inside. got soft serve ice cream. reached another cup get spoon know gross others reached get theirs. took spoon outside sanitized it. ate ice cream car. Even huge deal me. kind terrifying. 

 food ever ate delivery always microwave increase temperature. 

Even virus gone (fingers crossed) probly gonna take time adjust. OCD sanitation probably gonna linger.

Oh well.. good luck stay safe. Yeah, sadly even governor california bailed middle it. kids school “don’t come school sick” policy, also gives kids rewards kids finish term zero absences.   
My daughter go school sick keep “record”. (If let ) American dream stay alive one year next. unrealistic keep living comfortably, home ownership, affordable retirement, chicken every pot. That's fair. Hard make compliance rules argument leadership got rid rules We're going need clothes. really matter.

We sub 10% herd immunity even ""best"" case. Austria fraction people virus all.

No need think second infection barely anyone it. Plus everyone gets quarantine contact tracing.

The UK Sweden already showed herd immunity work. able get infected twice non-issue. but... wanted ask, would covid-19 transmissible blood pressure cuffs? donate plasma realized one things everyone seems overlook. neighbors west house least 5 parties since April. mind blowing amount fireworks prior Fourth multi hour mega bombing Fourth July they’re average area. San Bernardino much testing either lots asymptotic pre symptomatic people likely present. I’m going guess Burlington. US leaders bail middle countries kept up. problem US never federal leadership. Sweden made dumb decision. disagree, preserve sanity I'm watching news updates everyone going little insane all. 

I wear mask whenever leave house, wash soon get home. keep distance people constantly keep date advice come government. need that. I'm part try make feel like i'm not.

I simply enquiring something, you, knowledgeable topic, happy advise upon. 

Belittling talking people reckless give single care situation going make lose audience. Ever relevant Marilyn Manson quote

The death one tragedy
The death millions statistic may true, doubt could say border states WA MA. USA #1 baby Americans always right thing ... avenues approach tried extensively. Boris Johnson “does like eating healthy food” either, well fuck, sometimes need eat vegetables dessert, buddy. That's totally OK that's understanding going in. point promoting attitude ""no risk getting trial / better nothing"" misleading. second this!

I also bought cheap Chinese GP-5 knock-off, amazingly cheap full face respirator 20 bucks, new. Normally, old GP-5 gas masks asbestos filters cost 20 bucks days jumped price. Chinese knockoff accept modern 40mm filters, have.

C'rat half-assed PR job 👍 still reaping whirlwind today Seems point schools open. bars restaurants closed moved outdoors, apply schools. way propagating trump voting. three four week lag cases deaths - we’ll probably around 1500 deaths two weeks.

But testing bottlenecks early crisis, slight improvement treatment due reduction ventilator usage remdesivir, younger infection population due behavior protections 60 contributing. 

Remember early dozens stories across country nursing homes losing lots patients. think cos least Biden let 140k people die US least listens science, people done Trump administration's corruption murderous incompetence

That's gist got others answering question

Personally, voting Biden simply cos I'm eligible vote count (not American voting age) business kids feed. gets wet, assume significantly less protective, change dry one possible umbrella even wet mask still offer partial protection. South Georgia &amp; North Florida them. They're owned sane parent company Bi-Lo, Harvey's, &amp; Food Lion. Wait, we're 140 thousand? thought still around 135 thousand mark. o.O

Not that's much difference. Ever seen book/movie called Road? way like either Neoliberal/corporate Dems ton hatred left. whole primary season using Republican fear mongering attack Sanders. too, enforce well I’m really sure anyone would assuming current prevailing strain transmissible based observation alone, given West seemingly reopening rapidly bringing people back contact other. It’s exactly controlled trial it. brand &amp; product use? Yeah, guy also believes moon starship piloted lizardlike aliens. anyone research 'sources' anymore? home school forever dab public education. hence age old adage, pro opposite con, what's opposite progress think society live - matter skin political color, principles we're forced accept society (usually voice parents, mere result society live in). I, myself, repeatedly sent school sick, know why? unless SEVERE fever, coughs manageable. raised believe feel fine perform tasks normally, case 99% colds caught, good go. schools typically punish absentees, incentive parents send school (or even insist going).

That changed like 16-17 parents longer controlled school routine treated like grown-up, point decided would go would accept consequences going. late: already made believe long feeling FINE, truly fine. 

And let's face - society promote sick staying home (no matter cause - minor discomfort hurts whenever walk, still walk somewhat normally). 

Unless pandemic trigger needed truly go online permanently (and option complete tasks - either school work, online time choosing go time), things go back 'normal' eventually. Anyone A/B test feature platform standard procedure ad campaign. take coders kind do.  you.. joking? sad lol Dumb dumber. UK said go healthcare workers first, elderly next (assuming works well enough them, sometimes vaccine requires recipient decent immune system, Oxford vaccine team said expect vaccine well that) one researchers said may available distribution general public Christmas 2020, everything goes really well. clear US timeline like. embarrassing. anti-mask protests county. many entitled people care health others. Lol Esquire 
I live el Paso im mexican. arent concentration camps nice try. easy think America shitty country havent lived squalor yourself. Fantasies ungrateful think grass always greener side.  magically disappear April, remember? lab studies, cholesterol-lowering drug Fenofibrate (Tricor) showed extremely promising anyone wondering drug studying.

Damn, one take. Maybe need draft World War teach young people sacrifice really means. school start. Foreward! cliff! theory yes, lock whole country, job done. simple. Tourism one Ireland main income sources. planes still coming daily tourists around world. Many self isolating arrive. sad classic example profit people. fair feel government good job communicative throughout took action early. still, need close boarders unless people Quarentine people care. counter dangers getting covid it’s possible ling term effects. long term effects extended lockdown  New Zealand says hi Biden polls older voters much better Trump though Surprisingly, OC [9th worst county cases per capita last 14 days. Donald Trump set plan significant mortality 2 months ago. Mire Even part discharged recovering corona patients nursing homes? *Sigh*


Puts Comfortably Numb India , education system gives whole history early 3rd-10 class part social studies subject (Geography, History, Civics, Economics) Bronze age indian subcontinent 3000BCE - 1950 today indian constitution economic situations development India . 7years learn whole history Indus civilization current indian constitution .as part History Social studies subject . learnt major history points like American Independence, French Revolution, Fall Constantinople, Bostan Tea Party, Napolean life story, Colonization Spain, Portugal, French, British Industrial revolution Britain . new neighbors already 2 parties since moved here....it's 3 months. leadership take covid seriously, neither community. sucks. time pay piper now. Percent positive control now.  lives businesses? Corporations people too, friend. “anti-mask” sort right wing thing

reddit overwhelmingly left everything bad automatically right-wing. way since around 2018 getting worse annoying. 1.	We’ve learned treat disease effectively since NY spike ( dexamethasone, Remdesivir, etc)

2.	 Death rate lags spikes weeks, deaths per million assuredly increase.

3.	Median age COVID patients trending significantly younger = less likely die 

4.	Theory floating around mutation caused virus contagious less deadly months.

5.	NY labeled large amount deaths likely / presumed covid deaths without confirmation. No, shit.  drug US hoarded supply next three months, leaving rest world without Thank you, great read  thinking protests masks, also astroturfed. sounds like vermont basically saskatchewan, although saskatchewan sucks dunno... phrase original statement poorly; don’t think conservatives bad dumb. better explain, guys work type snooty conservatives automatically default anything California New York automatically bad; mention names states it’s always met scoff, matter topic. don’t work liberals don’t know snooty liberal equivalent would be, I’m guessing Texas.


New York City accounts bulk New York’s numbers; ridiculously high population density high amount inbound traffic exacerbate cases deaths. Remember far back March, NY listed one aggressive responders pandemic. I’m saying best; countries like South Korea way better US state. Great job Mr. Braun. MoH RKI still unsure do, Kanzleramtsminister become driving force German coronavirus response pretty great job, MoH bungled crisis like ill-prepared toddler.

It kind hard-working politicians getting job done helped country. way less 0.2% was. year 2070, woken covid coma 75 years old. YAY! :D

Now could get most/all general population wear masks public! o.O Yep, thise cancer always want go chemo treatments.  vermonts tiny state full white people cause theyre far north

down south theres much brown diversity closer central america draw immigrant everywhere Coronavirus time dilation ex'husband took daughter local lake day swimming playing where, according her, lot people. frustrates state rising cases, live mother I'm disabled. mother compromised immune system, dad heavy smoker. I'd hoping planning go visit great-grandmother week seen months can't worry potential exposure. grandmother cancer comfortable going house socially distanced staying home 99% time. Thankfully limited ability travel first place become useful tool. 

But feels though daughter punished apparent lack concern. excited go explain couldn't. top that, dropped yesterday, yesterday took lake dropping evening. told busy showed shells she'd picked told she'd gotten lake yesterday even found out. going idiot going around bunch people, least let parent know. least feel like told me. 

So it'll longer see grandmother fault feel like we're punished things right. just.... sad frustrating right now

ETA: long wait deem clear? full two weeks? child-specific symptoms watch for? American *movies* do. Real life America doesn't. Eventually everything alright. Tell parents wear mask (no cloth ones protect -- use N95 gas masks), follow standard procedure sanitation nuclear attack. sure schools US teaches learned middle school China super helpful. big dumb idiot man. funny young people vote vote. means virtually never decide elections president. ""propagating pandemic"" pretty much guarantee candidate wins November. get putting effort all. mandatory masks outside lockdown. cases dropped 18-65 per day, masks voluntary basis.


Now 140 cases day Monday implement mandatory mask rule (as media informed us). Still see quite people already wearing even it’s mandatory. 


Okay, way smaller US, react quickly. mean *beautifully*👌 terrible Wait there's schools open right now? researchers traced tested nearly 60,000 people contact infected people found that, average, 11.8% household contacts tested positive people lived patients ages 10 19, 18.6% tested positive virus within 10 days initial case detected -- highest rate transmission among groups studied. Children younger 10 spread virus lowest rate, though researchers warned could change schools reopen.

So let's get middle high schools open! mom's dealer 4 coworkers casino works tested positive last week. Casinos trying sweep rug avoid shutdown long see lasting another week. Somewhere someone longest, harrowing tale journey home pandemic. Aye! happening time husband's father murdered, mother diagnosed stage four brain cancer.
Every day go work Walmart dozen active cases (they tell us, associates drop like flies get news family days later) take risk bringing Covid back already dying mother.
But course care. family says ""The ones dying already dying""
So gives fuck mother dies, right? Let's cut already unfairly short life even shorter republican family can't wear mask.

I even want take meds anymore.
It's 5am I've since 3am. start work 1pm want go virus factory. want risk mother. know anymore. Besides pray get unemployment take care mother last month two. Fuck everything else.

Is fucked feel better knowing others struggling too? poor husband beats struggles that's try remind him. us. Life shit right struggle everyone. live small town France since end confinement wearing masks indoors adopted businesses public transit matter common sense. Right, watched HBO’s Watchmen recently, getting kick alternate universe shenanigans going (like Robert Redford actor presidency instead Ronald Regan, etc.) shocked google search brought Tulsa Massacre real event, never heard referenced life.
As Utahn, knew Japanese Internment Camps one camp located it’s museum atrocities. Took elementary school trip years ago.

Edit: spelling US still problems period though... did.) 

Ah yeah, post slavery, KKK imperialist period USA surely *great.* that’s reason government / health administration/ rescue units *begged implored* people risky outdoor activities lockdown.


People „free time“ office, asked refrain excessive outdoor activities support rescue units (they better things rescue mountain sprained ankle) keep hospitals free real emergencies. want send kids teachers back school you’re ignoring educated people us give us advice fight virus?  funny people legitimately can't wear mask really that. online shopping curbside pick up, etc.  going work means lifetime disability debt, lack health insurance, poverty. Unfortunately US, poverty dehabailiting long term effects COVID-19 people world, good people. agree underestimate? Lmao. guy reminds scheming evangelist. yes correct profesional realize legit mask.

 said workers, i.e. grocery store employees like. 

so read ""i imagine videos coming people wearing masks stores told look like valve filter, count mask than""

not saying agree, saying read article saw picture thought looked similar masks circular disk stuck front. people medial training could easily see think valves.

edit. brings another point employees business forced police public actions kinda shitty thing make do. I’m Sutter County, CA it’s almost exactly sane stats here, almost transmission family/peer group. 

This week, walked around neighborhood, saw multiple barbecues, pool parties, several pickup sports games park. masks seen. 

At least schools closed start year. Well order keep money, constantly keep play? 

And right now, that's shut economy, greater instability, power changes hands disappears. 

So willing keep appearances navigate retain power amidst uncertainty. 

But yeah maybe keep hitting walls class system time put end concentrated wealth concentrated power. 

Concentrated power necessity representation people could happen delegates. longer case.

I mean really, start tying voting blockchain something independently verified, system par mail-ins independently verifiable, solve problems identity verification exploitation. 

Gee maybe fingerprint+selfie something, suddenly people vote smartphones open much broader audience interested weighing politics. naturally alter representation needs look like matures time. 

I cant believe smart enough solve voting nonsense. Kinda like old people caring young people’s future... Maybe jump slightest chance book holidays anywhere months, maybe ""highest global increase cases"" stops every single day? Let us know goes! thought realise big problem asymptomatic spread was. Worse part new infection raises likelihood evolution virus. sure, generally viruses fight pushed towards less deadly variants, nature survival would bemoan same, evolution Russian roulette talk virus mass infection. many terrorist attacks happened niqab france? Yep 0.
It's irony. Banning niqab hijab school beaches nothing security. Ah, guess wont shopping Winn-Dixie anymore Yeah, great force everyone work home. Fuck retarded shitwomble Human subjective think. /r/COVID19/comments/ht8nce/melatonin_inhibits_covid19induced_cytokine_storm/ may well prove effect future research, mild sleeping aid available counter regions help sleep better, little risk trying. exceed medically recommend dosages. F$%k yeah, spread it. people raised there, rest world many people think/used think way America. 

The rest world fucking terrified USA long time. Funny, count proper source, try again. sort people would’ve stuffed faces horse shit prove cars terrible introduced apparently cause head spontaneously explode. something like new reason can't wear masks. Many watching behind moose. winners civil war. /r/keto start survive later Perhaps I'm missing something. didnt see studies looked top 5 results. Saw 2 results Fauci saying virus ""could"" cause lingering chronic fatigue like symptoms, article one woman lingering symptoms months, 2 seemingly completely unrelated links. Could point study talking specifically? Thanks! error accurate (which I'm pretty skeptical given excess deaths much greater COVID death total) 290 000 confirmed cases suggesting 22 500 died cause last months. That's quite absurd claim. Human mortality around 1% year statistically 0.25% people died last 3 months. error could possibly account ~725 extra deaths really happening.

It hurts argument make obviously incorrect statements. Indeed, need study showing touch face more. American dream still alive, it’s grueling achieve pays bills. start. period 2020 2027 known ""2020"" historians, similar phrase "" Great War"" defined period. also utterly stupid, effective way battle virus minimal effects economy. reason lower fatality ratio maybe favorable demography, stellar management. Higher ratio young people elders. 
Ofcourse simple think is, elected representatives handle pressure emergency like situation buckle give way. rather pointing good becoming complacent, need criticize keep maintaining pressure government keep whatever bare minimum currently doing. Remindme! 5 days

Downward trend? recurring weekly trend saturdays low? addition said, recent study suggesting melatonin may helpful reducing risk cytokines storms. See may well prove effect future research, mild sleeping aid available counter regions help sleep better, little risk trying. exceed medically recommend dosages. Take care best luck family! People also get reinfected flu length time virus around. even single year yet people like making claims would even know yet. 何 former resident Burlington. one lives state. like six people Vermont think band. non statistic. republican nearby, still risk. This, 1000 times this. think young. good. Hope wave passes many less deaths possible live relatively new condo winter (mostly January). Otherwise live woods rest year. independent HVACs units. still worry transmission even though air recirculation units none could gather recirculate air hallways. It’s good know HEPA filters. Thanks article. 6 months innitial symptoms hell hole, pace constantly test new limits rest body quite there... honestly rest rest rest months.

Do best try catch this.

Stay safe fear are. Meaning fear people think magically go away everybody wears face mask without measure Read: Stupid Southern business stupid Southern things. 🙄 get it, cops liars they're probably lying covid parties they've broken up.

No defintely broken parties. news put umbrella ""Covid parties"" extending definition Covid party - ""a party people dont think impacted almost realize there's pretty hefty penalties anyone purposely trying spread covid, i.e. biological terrorism.

So would surely want give name people committed crime, maybe address parents could aware children attended one Covid parties, right?

But single specific instance ""named"" attempt follow information confirmation hit dead ends. heresay. know that's undocumented means right? Yet, lot people lost jobs lives this. telling someone yesterday case months knowing spreads. said numbers fake lockdowns spread it. teacher sick days whatever put partner emergency room back February. took ibuprofen, taught small group wide distance, disinfected surfaces worked at. miserable couldn’t afford check reduced. doctors didn’t know was, tested flu (it wasn’t). Remember economy going drive lot us weigh scales differently, even us lucky enough escape job loss reduced salaries. mean fair banning Niqab nothing wearing mask health reasons, kind cool bringing up. 

Furthermore, France prime target extremist terrorism due potential pool home-grown terrorists (there 7 million people islamic faith France, means potential pool extremists higher country outside muslim majority countries). 

After Bataclan, Nice, etc. think people's right protected, Niqab urban equivalent freaking ghillie suit - anyone :/ comparison, face mask health purposes like wearing scarf winter :) exhalation valves. wearing P100 respirator, going catch covid can't spread it. Also, exhalation valve slow breath spread far. Larger droplets stay inside mask. Best solution probably put cloth filter valve think P100 masks fine is. 

Wearing surgical mask underneath also quite easy stops face getting sweaty mask makes contact respirator. immediate reaction jump say deaths reported. hear out. Covid 19 seem affect Indians much white people. genetics play here. state first report case India. Currently, 12000 confirmed cases 40+ deaths. kind media attention, impossible hide mass deaths here. pretty terrible  Oh okay. Thanks. Police situation Maharashtra reported bad. peak Texas Quite impressed level misinformation guys topic. Turns good old fashioned stupidity. require masks parents kept babies room, thinking 6 feet apart would actually effective. Total idiots. Y'all acting like whoever sitting president default party line time. 100% time case Biden. Yeah quickly US rising compared France?

The US response right crap numbers overall quickly become worst world, exception countries following exact formula us. imagine videos people arguing professionals one-way valves rather actual n95 filters.

I imagine even saying anything since obvious professionals aren’t exhaust valves. Nurses make good money. Plenty. balm gilead

is song may named gilead. balm gilead referred christian bible too. Whatever was, seemed regarded cure many ills. Yeah. population density still thing, last that. Wyoming less, cases, so... people make well known Senators tolerate anything less.

As taking months, creative. that? 

The states done fairly well bar Bihar (after pathetic video), Maharashtra Delhi (Do bad needed central government intervention) Tamil Nadu. Karnataka losing now. believe states still control?

Best way would ideally shutdown state borders allow state handle it. states seem lose shit fairly easily. 

It's simple think is. dynamics complex disease reaching rural areas, shouldnt worrisome. ""Until now, parents NICU able spend time infants without masks, policy changing. "" shit speaks itself.  Facts don’t care feelings. Sorry owned hard, thought intelligent turned be. Fear comes uncertainty. ignorant jackass pushing platitudes build either certainty confidence. Unfortunately, newspaper supporting DeSantis saying COVID-19 better treated back March. true, hospitals overwhelmed people triaged soon come door. 

This 'we know go back work school' bullshit fostering fear, know welfare general public bottom list DeSantis's priorities. ""Until now, parents NICU able spend time infants without masks, policy changing. "" open beds babies, room, spaced 6 feet apart somehow CLUE even 30 feet apart, virus air get every corner room. call incompetence. experience Irvine pretty alright. People stayed exactly 6 feet apart spaced everyone wearing masks. Might I'm much asian parts Irvine that's experience.  3) Improved hospital protocols increase survival some. remdesivir, dexamethasone, proning, know avoid ventilators long possible. things become less valuable though hospitals become overrun. one likes school anyway look happening Catalonia 1200 cases 24h, somehow cannot believe masks mandatory :( ...Down Disease?? changed two words original lyrics... I'm going put /s lot often. ... 40% population... WTF doing? pox parties? moronic thinking enemy areas across south pretty obvious enemy winning Death. Wasn’t talking Corona, clear lol  virus allowed spread unchecked, economy would suffer people sick work. “You got Harvard Law?”
“What, like it’s hard?”
Cue DeSantis application video hot tub wearing pink bikini👙 No, 100% watched happen first still nothing. lot Americans *very* dumb. obnoxiously proud that. probably pedophile nazi racist too. Yes, every single morning. comment strange people look like three heads. karma assist Florida elsewhere leaders refuse courageous needed protect public I’m curious think New York success story hit worst city US? LOW IQ Don’t blame young people. It’s lack leadership blame. Yes, almost like national leadership something might shift little.... Without getting political here, Ireland control full island. share border UK. anyone wanted come country shut airports commercial flights could fly UK Belfast try sneak Ireland border control breakthrough ? Looks similar one use biking replaceable pollution filter valves. Probably big difference silicone air tight. Aside concept. Skeleton remains reveal native americans suffered horribly bad cases stuff like smallpox. Like really *really* bad cases compared, european person going disease. 

This strongly indicates, takes generations DNA build blueprint deal new pathogens. 

It if, people wanna grow gills flood coming. intend grow gills survive flood, going take generations get there. Recklessly living lives caring lowering chances others live lives. It’s yet though. Keep it. Glad know! one late 60s America grandparents even forgot about. Thanks killing us. Go take read CIA FBI done past 100 years.

COINTELPRO Operation Condor good start.

Then you’ll really disgusted history classes hide. low chance death healthy. Sounds reasonable. go, put results in.

[Covid 19 county mean, really stretch pick random county USA say there's positive spread? vaccine running around something? introvert af.

I found people.


prepare never meet immunity recovery. Natural selection. remmeber amazed we'd even approached let alone surpassed US fatalities Vietnam, violent multi year conflict, one seemed bat eye. 

Now I'm overwhelmingly confident we'll easily surpass Civil War fatalities (over 600,000 non Americans). kinda...ick. Well shit, every single person family either fat, old, both. Everyone surprised people staying away. Ofcourse will. Whatever virus have, simple cold Covid, dont want catch have. happy given space lol it’s accelerating first headline sub 6 months following make put phone say loud ‘Jesus fucking Christ’. Congratulations, it. predict article **Metro** shared one million times today across facebook mommy groups. Pretty sure rising rates caused random gatherings large cities thousands people. Go ahead criticize see hoe far get.

Edit: hehe see? Im surprised comment isnt -100 already Yes, although might find difficult stay away people still see anything good.

I visited zoo local area, social distancing difficult least anywhere near big attractions. visited weekday, busier ever seen it!

You could check recent reviews Google see mention busy crowded is. wish hindsight done local zoo, point chaotic is. Maybe Fauci propagating cuz created first place? Masks filters selfish. Yeah, fuck everybody else, get dough, amirite? Like, fault give someone disease kills them. 

&amp;#x200B;

... could saying maybe need paid sick leave. They’re still trying figure out. experts say no, concern many people still testing positive symptoms resolved quarantine over. 

I friend (we work healthcare) still test positive shortly symptoms resolved he’s quarantine over. someone many peers healthcare. Many reservations ruling out. 


Think it, test still detects virus swab sputum test, would make someone think virus can’t escape cough sneeze. 

One professional mention virus contagious it’s victim exhibits symptoms. words many mixed opinions this. It’s kinda funny. Vietnam similar structure China, right proactive lockdowns Covid response. Vietnam gets credit, there’s New Cold War brewing them.  Seems like lot Americans trying really hard get nominated Darwin award moment... lot Asian families do, personally family found really uncomfortable collectively agreed comfort worth us additional protection. feel Ok wearing mask home, may well, would reduce risk intra-family transmission, one study China found household transmission rate went 10% 3% additional precautions may include masking home, see Table 3 feel terrible workers. signed death warrant think fact infections deaths near non existent early hard hit states NY NJ point least partial herd immunity? least fact virus burned pretty much ran rampant? feel like everywhere locked early response happening places go extent. hope I'm wrong though. think kind of, maybe, sort see logic that. lot mass parties took place lockdown lifted. Maybe lockdown wasnt strict, allowed something like 5 people max congregate, mass parties/ total disregard social distancing wouldnt happened. Probably still would happened people stupid tho. majority people street college kids seemed take lockdown pretty serious. many unfamiliar cars visiting time. lockdown got less restrictive went nuts. barely find parking spot night due large parties thrown. recently tho noticed many party goers wearing masks, positive, guess. question everyones mind ""where end?"" Please let know anyone else might feeling same; feel like I'm going crazy! Within last week I've metallic taste mouth, slight loss taste (I taste food swear almost tasteless , like could use lot salt) fatigued point legs shake bit stand. want sleep, matter I've awake hour two feel like I'm ready go back bed. feel dizzy head fog. drink water I'm nauseous, food stays mentioned tastes bland. try rest, eat vegetables, drink ton water day end day know feel normal. driving mad! alone? Fauci fakest person ever one could seen coming.

And it’s impossible know effects no-masks opening schools. could actually good thing. can’t prove would bad evidence would accept, therefore expert think may actually good thing.

Edit: wow guys, considered using /S tag, thought would interesting social experiment see even possible stupid enough must sarcasm. worry realize sarcasm, fault, fault utter morons could actually say straight face. Apart others told scientific evidence, tell also parents masks also help flu take flu lightly (specially older) Smart. Can’t blame Germany, indoors wearing it, 10% wearing wrong idiots. I'm surprised becoming mandatory now. case 4 months ago already?  press-ups tho /s Deaths lagging number new cases, looks like started increasing bottoming out. expect see start climbing next weeks. wonder next year we'll reliable excess death figures. Iran looked like getting hit unusually hard (even standards everything we've seen July) back March.  American officials stressed believe Chinese operatives created lockdown messages, rather amplified existing ones. efforts enabled messages catch attention enough people spread own, little need work foreign agents. messages appeared gain significant traction Facebook also proliferating texts, according analysis New York Times.

TL;DR folks China retweeted falsehood already wild. Ironically interpreted ""dumb get covid die"" Forgive ignorance here, I’m American, impossible states close borders prevent interstate spread? know that’s true undergrad, harvard law? think legacied harvard law?

I think it’s much likely he’s rich doesn’t care poor people. shouldn’t leadership role. mean shit dude lol think NSW going keep control? live US (in American ""WA"", Washington state) I've following stuff going Australia lot coworkers spent time last year. hope numbers Victoria increase much beyond recent 300-400 per day, next week telling, it'll also telling Sydney/NSW 10-15 per day goes back starts upward trend similar Victoria. like Seattle, seems people pretty good job following guidelines takes mess everything up.

Aside: visited Melbourne early October last year developed fever stuff eventually lost voice. hope pre-pre-Covid anyone knew :P know joke Australian coworkers patient zero there.

Also burgers disgusting hell ""burger rings""... “It’s cold” enters chat... say locally 14 registered corona deaths town 3 tested negative antibody covid death certificate 3 miners currently 3 families fighting Pneumoconiosis CISWO involved.

Anything respiratory related COPD putting corona certificate regardless.

Not mention NHS asking long term cancer sufferers like friend sign DNR. Vermont awesome little state. Wearing mask room good idea talking her, otherwise distancing enough, people spray lot potentially infectious droplets talking compared regular breathing. want spend time her, outdoors would safer indoors. Take care best luck! beat much, take calculated risks sometimes. Well us don’t get paid don’t come work. Sorry get sick need get money


Edit: obviously talking Corona. I’m talking normal times Flu/Cold.


I wouldn’t go work Corona lol get Corona get Corona wise. Obviously government's secret plan stop us going shops pubs economy collapses go wear mask can't identify us cctv. Normal masks cause that. driving see doctor find what's actually causing poor health. posing danger others. 

I stage IV endometriosis tearing lungs wear mask 8+ hours almost everyday problems. grandma 90s wears mask well. 2 year old God son wears mask face shield. 

If toddler wear mask think can, buddy. taking virus serious. must also admit ask people social also unhealthy. can’t ask people stay away people love long vaccine medicine.

Note: talking massive gatherings here. talking toddlers visiting grandpa grandma.

Note 2: seen people lockdown months. even family. Idaho doesnt even compare stupid south places like Florida Texas. Florida cases one day Idaho total Poor reference chernoble? US give fighting virus, actively fight Repost. thing would mention provincial parties federal parties technically linked way. may similar names policies separate entities. indeed, caution though, many folk young even close obese, mostly don’t asthma, fit. It’s YOUTUBE comedians. lulz. love part one got bit introspective mentioning mom suggestion move go “adulting” (my words) Italy ""functionally solved"" problem. Neither country Europe. care, crave it. check kind thread everyday salt really wants teach possible could take tutoring position find job school district virtual classes?

It seems districts could really widen pool potential staff classroom. Maybe schools hiring? certain actually said first, [surely Marilyn Manson. side note. comes specific cases, certainly misattributions. comes capturing scale problem, show vastly exceed errors missing Covid deaths?

There well 65,000 excess deaths last month. betting real number Covid deaths less half official counts, means less 23k would Covid.

So unexplained factor killed 40,000 extra people modern precedent last 4 months UK, midst peacetime pandemic? Low cost housing compared Washington that’s sure. Bingo. think stupidity free pass, DeSantis corrupt evil. CDC data   

rip Yeah, guess real case count 6-8 times confirmed count.

But even 10 1 historically 8-1 moving forward, puts us ~35,000,000 cases far 600,000 new cases day. roughly run levels January, 30,000 month dying many long term health issues. 

I’m hoping partial herd, immunity new administration end February-March 2021 damn it’s going long year.

IF immunity lasts year 40 percent recovered gets us enough immunity slow things down,  Law Prepandemic normalcy come back. pandemic ever lasted forever. ""roaring twenties"" happened biggest pandemic recorded date. Many things change permanently geopolitics, work, sanitary healthcare policies etc, happens historical shock. day day life without social distancing, masks etc come back sooner later. drug that's used 40 years believe. horrible side effect. side effects. given onset symptoms ventilators. Stupidity free pass. guy corrupt evil. Yeah, dare experienced people top. Zoomers bosses since understand modern world better. Stupidity free pass. guy corrupt evil. I'm somewhat surprised MLB plan ok states like New York. also 14 day quarantine measures people arriving Florida? gonna waved? rest world basically.

From I've heard friends Germany seems like everything still slow, government considering lockdowns fail contain seeing cases rural Germany now. going back normal contained try minimize economic damage expense human lives? Sweden seems said ""fuck yolo"" whole thing.

In experience Asian people much worried diseases spreading since SARS outbreak much easier government motivate people wear masks, stay home, etc. versus US people largely ignorant well... build, that's different issue, building something temporarily wasteful, ignoring safety regulations checks building rushing like also big issue fly outside corrupt authoritarian regime.

What source China sort safety checks new hospitals? find lot videos YouTube talk hospital. It’s real hospital real checks done make sure systems worked, engineered like data, I'm guessing longer goes see year satisfied naturally gain long term immunity protect us elder years, virus alone shaves sold 3 years + life expectancy. especially young

*and* fit, forget. agree good updates, speaking eloquently goes long way lot people. give NY credit getting need everybody already died, I’m gonna agree model state. Literally state model state compared them. Keep up! agree vast majority medical condishun people lying context problem could make wearing mask agonizing, [trigeminal rare extremely so. 40,000 people diagnosed per year US. Donald FUCK Que clase de comepinga. Hate backfire. Try walk shoes first. binary. entire world naive can't? requires majority Cabinet, Mike Pence sign on.   New York defunded police 1billion, welcome murder capital What? Downvotes matter. Karma matter.

But know I'm getting downvoted. conflicting?

Are drunk? tried ACT Dry Mouth Lozenges? problem seem help  Oh god Long Island. keep seeing patients clinic PA reason continue traveling back forth Long Island. stay fuck home! choir church members singing pews? Sorry, sending sick senior citizens worked built city place equipped handle acceptable. NYC always takes hardest hits adapt recover well. got solid pride.  course not. Conspiracy theorists believe want believe. actually consider evidence. can't get someone opinion logic get opinion logic begin with. Wow illuminating comment   That’s cool, still doesn’t justify NY/NJ worst death rate entire world covid lol. two states way proportion it’s even funny. politicians going say rate going Louisiana resident here. weekend data known total mess ages. support change, stretch, tend suspect part minor public opinion manipulation campaign. apparently governor mentioned going happen passing weeks ago. discussion /r/Coronaviruslouisiana , too. That's like 0.0000000000000000000001% world population ? again. 

NY extremely rampant outbreaks specific parts city pre lockdown little warning feds. describing small part city entire city. 

Sweden back rise. also outlier benefited world air hub test Europe locking down. Florida opposite that. Major world travel hub surrounded states lockdowns rampant spread.

There's nothing prove. There's miracle goes away. plenty case studies. Florida magically fine. 



Sweden House Whites acting destroy nation. need start guarding protesters guns shoot fuckers kidnapping.. 

Or maybe want..

Just seems wrong stand democracy turns military enforced dictatorship. Thanks. It’s terrible. left couple years ago form startup friends, wife still works there. 

They’ve eased bit due covid, it’s still draconian there. Facts. Yes. White House advisor says Trump want distracted pandemic.

Unfortunately, school district reasonable size, guy probably sitting administrative office somewhere (or right now, home) interacted school child beyond photo op years.

Source: teacher large school district. lot people still limbo waiting unemployment. Hawaii, started PUA program, paid weeks, stopped payments message says ""This week paid issue resolved."", issue listed, letter, nothing. even phone number call, submit question web site, never answered.

This forcing people go look ways make money. want people stay home, need fix PUA UI programs. That’s bosses want. driving crazy ruining family

This attitude seriously starting piss off. Humanity sucks. feel terrible every child caught this. amount social media whining parents can't handle kids time ""I need break!""

FREEEEEEEDOM...

There reason give kids freedom cross busy roads own. knowledge experience equipt ability make good judgement calls. 

Meanwhile expect people understand threats pandemic prior experience. number Boomers. Geezers geriatric i've seen going shops without masks hand sinatizer blows mind. Fauci right saying young people propagating this. wrong pretend old people bad cases worse. know bit better. 

I got offered stack dispossable masks bottle sanitizer additional purchase checkout day. need wearing mask showed lady little tube alcohol sanitizer. said i'd buy old fella behind me. 

The old git swore refused accept gift. lady already included purchase left gave lady bus wearing scarf cause masks. least trying. funds stack masks hand cleaner. Breaking news: little persons work like big persons Every time see someone say wanna claw eyes out. Intelligence normally distributed. Therefore, mean median nearly same, thus half people fact dumber average person. they’re big religion. I've waiting someone this. want mask like ones Avatar, N95 filters. One allows people see lips/teeth/facial expressions, option microphone speaker. one allows work physically without short breath. Hell yeah! live too. Scream window real quick I’ll listen 👂  ""it's 99% survivable""

""The damage economy worse""   worked UK. People allowed go beach park allowed small gatherings gardens, long keep 6 feet apart. Wow, man. sounds like giving lot anxiety.

Take precautions. still scary, forget doomsday virus. making good progress development vaccine. I'm scared too. I'm right you. hope teachable moment people. 

I'm curious. lived Arizona life? everything that's going on, want move? Damn it, WH! bet Trump’s admin Trump doesn’t want look bad, especially election year, guess pull data. none friends , family, girlfriend lean nd reach . right temporary, hard temporary. also measure entire bodies going ever finds out. Probably 3 months something like that. Yeah, that's probably mind went there.  feel ya buddy. seems line drawn people ability sacrifice wants protect well well others around people don't. truly sad man..I always wanted believe type people far hiding plain sight. make great beer think Google meet ? send link what's app soon clicks video start. preset turn video every call though. 1% 300 million 3 million guy  American here. learning Canadian politics, UCP provincial political party part nationally recognized Conservative Party Canada. Like Minnesota, state Democratic Party named DFL Party. know Liberal centrist/centre-left type party. Maybe Canadian could fill stuff, thanks. ""The number new cases coronavirus rose almost 260,000 24 hours - largest single-day increase since pandemic began, World Health Organization (WHO) said Saturday.

According WHO, first time number new daily infections surpassed quarter million.

The biggest increases US, Brazil, India South Africa.

The global death toll coronavirus also rose 7,360 - largest daily increase since 10 May.

The previous record rise new confirmed cases recorded one day earlier."" stats correct logic flawed – getting struck lightning contagious unlike virus. let's say one kid one family goes school – perhaps kid symptoms, symptoms mild parents think nothing it. kid, kids do, touches everything sight. Coughs mouth open, sneezes things, etc. kids touch surfaces become infected become carriers. go home . . . need continue? . . . exponential growth likely. bur hes businessman politician!! busy comforting awful tragedy hurt him. could say citizen almost country world. everybody else figured shit out. Much like concept wearing seat belt, unwise sort out. Sure novel idea...  I’m sorry should’ve put /s thought part enough. It’s sad ridiculous isn’t exactly rare days. CO tried universal healthcare via referendum. Didn’t pass housebroken idiots voting self interest. *""the hospitals full, said get rid hospitals.""*

~ president fucktard future, probably healthy regard safety fear. afraid Trump let 5,000 people die, plain stupid. minutes... per person. Seems... scalable... sounds like satisfied mediocrity response think could done better. don’t doubt could lot worse too.

You jumping conclusion support narrative. Nothing said satisfied response; fact nothing entire conversation response pandemic beyond can't really fault hospital's, hospital leadership macro level.

The short answer happy overall response, blame belong. responsibility falls entirely state's health department governor. lack stock piles PPE falls FEMA. President US little responsibility, hospital administration next responsibility response. Hospitals treat patients best ability, make request supplies via supply chain FEMA. That's it. state poor response, go complain heath department governor. no. didn’t sign this.

Yes, literally did. choose become healthcare worker. always known risk getting sick dying result always present. matter COVID19, SARS, number influenzas viruses, Ebola, etc. etc. ALWAYS risk, pandemic. CDC reports roughly [93 doctors, nurses, die year exposure contact work. risk clearly laid everyone enters healthcare. Yes, healthcare workers signed this. Yes, perfectly rational assume healthcare workers accept risk chosen profession. 

Just pilots know risk crashing dying. police officers know might get shot die line duty, Fisherman know boat might sink might die; nurse knows might get virus bacterial infection prematurely end life. 

If healthcare worker, signed it, period. go work hospital COVID19 pandemic, choosing accept risk. Period. make choice stop fucking bitching it. Nothing one ability make working bedside safe pandemic novel coronavirus. unwilling risk life accept everyday go work could starting 14 day countdown death. Quit. choice make. shortage PPE mismanagement. could done better. hospital management isn’t capable setting buffer PPE rotation prevent excess expirations, certainly aren’t capable managing peoples lives.

How could done better exactly? hospitals buffer according plan; know plan should, would understand ridiculous sound. hospitals reserve, federal pandemic plan hospital starts break reserve get FEMA emergency supplies. problem FEMA supplies unusable either damaged, used replaced, years years date. feds tried buy supplies send hospitals US's supply chain sucked dry (Primarily) China Italy. stock held manufactures, medical supply chain gone. 

None falls hospital administrators. sure hospitals much buffer supposed (depending type hospital amount varies); part hospitals compliance. would know you’ve worked healthcare, bloated messed system is. Bullshit administrative jobs provide true productivity care. Contracts go lowest bidder. Corners cut wherever cut. systems suck ass lock frequently. Hospitals hire low quality workers means pay little less. every department providing actual care understaffed. Meanwhile executives plenty time take peoples temperatures doors, hand food, scratch balls hallways.

You must work profit. profit healthcare systems anything bloated, waste money anywhere, find bloat waste mean less profit. said, sound angry. I'd recommend job change system operates decisions hospitals make, ever, less providing best patient care bottom line. come family HCWs. lot HCWs see it. guess either see don’t.

I see it, bad describe. think bad private healthcare, want see public healthcare. Patient care even afterthought. guessing nurse far lobbying. attest first hand information one largest providers west coast lobbying state hard. Especially first round IMO premature cancelling electives. want business usual costs.

I sure want business usual, sure want expand services bring revenue, lay workers close hospitals, pandemic not, money, staff, drugs, PPE, facility. Vs expensive option? business...it be, is. Aren’t supposed quarantining get results? I’ve never tested dunno protocol border actually quite porous... common-sense seems leaking through.  consume caffeine (coffee, tea, sodas, chocolate)? Caffeine impacts absorption certain vitamins, including D3. May problem, least compounding it. Seriously. Anyone still supports people either

or

However, controlling pandemic, valves acceptable, unless exhale also filtered (but exhale filter get wet quickly needs replaced frequently, defeating longevity advantage). realize Trump fighting mail ballots voter fraud right

you're special one. ReCOrD iNfeCtIon NumBErS schools safe /s Fauci come say ""Some mask die. Good luck""  “despite”!? almost got UHC, nonetheless hear Bernie say bring elderly residents Canada inexpensive costs prescription drugs are, compared extremely high prices prescription drugs States. Alberta, I’ve heard conservative is, it’s like Texas Canada (maybe Canadians would confirm that’s accurate statement). stupid Jeff thinks people are. can’t make claim 7 month old virus doesn’t cause permanent damage. source states research required assess long term consequences. 

If march’s mild cases demonstrate recovery lung capacity stolen covid 1 year follow appointments, claim damage temporary made. Right it’s wishful thinking. Seems like solid plan. current job I’m happy lucky am. whole dept isn’t going back company improved since went home. one questions you’re sick taking day off. one cares take day you’re sick one wants including management. get stuff done send need fixed tell say thanks. meet boss month phone make sure I’m still alive. it’s business usual. live Spain population Arizona. We've 1400 since started counting! becomes easier see people think conspiracy going on. don’t need masks must wear masks. protests riots came economy reopening. Virus raging country. Months kids don’t usually get virus schools reopen story kids virus changes. Everyone associated managing epidemic fired. started outbreak everyone mandated wear masks woujdn’t here. watch videos China. stopped? allowed that?

Who allowed it? One man cannot simply say ""I'll power"", unless powerful people respect statement. experiences, black people wearing masks much. English second language? that’s power maple creamie extensive propaganda making sure believe best is, best ever be. I'm sure sending right message. people think they're literally getting put house arrest testing positive get tested tell anybody. ""may have"" many researchers skeptical even close proven. That's thing, nothing would helpful us all. dont competent leader, toddler yelling whatever brings back attention him. haha, wait watch... guys idea get title article getting shouldn’t also make people think mask gives immunity virus. 

It lowers chances. Add social distancing limiting contact people maybe get close immunity. don’t want either. So, paying wall?  much cost?  Mate, on?? It’s mildly concerning. It’s alarming. live Idaho, less 10 miles Washington. doctor (a specialist treats serious condition fwiw) Washington. office tried hard get order testing hospital close house drive testing set hospital. nurse spent entire day going back forth testing facility Idaho health department. insane. testing facility said orders testing faxed Idaho health department. Call health department told faxed hospital testing facility. Round round went.
I finally decided go urgent care Washington. Made one call them. Drove let know there, name, make/model/color car. Waited 10 minutes parking lot. nurse came hazmat suit, rolled window, held drivers license, put long qtip nose. Done. 

I would wasted time trying get list 2 hour long car line I’d known state (likely purposefully) making hard possibly people get tested. actually suggested going emergency room, you’d much likely get covid didn’t got there. 

Urgent care facilities Washington getting done quickly without forcing patients healthcare providers jump hoops merry go round gets nowhere. aren’t telling sick people whose doctors already ordered testing go emergency room wait hours surrounded others also really sick. 

It’s disgusting. doubt state government making happen. might feel like satisfy voters. could forced making close impossible test people federal government. Maybe state doesn’t access enough tests. can’t completely sure it’s like this, it’s horrible. high false negative rate  dropped half peak.

 
Nr ICU car late april 550, today 60.  
New patients ICU per day around mid April 45, today around 3.  
Deaths per day 95 mid April, two weeks ago 15  Looks like even less today. 


If talking new cases, take account tests increased 36k tests week 22 80k tests today. scary part won’t, they’ll keep letting people die. I’m Alabama, unless live among them, really don’t realize stupid people be. well, emergenc like gunshots, epilepsy, near death accidents, etc. , would want go er. Good them. Old people emitting deadly amounts CO2 caring either. reality lot full time teaching job openings over. sucks way things currently going that's way is. Honestly point y'all stay inside. far beyond mass testing. Get supplies bunker take care yourself. Wear damn mask outside. That's best do. maybe scheduled testing control flow people backlogs get processed.  dealing similar situation you. symptoms late March/early April. boyfriend also symptoms 4-5 days started experiencing mine. work nursing time exposed dozens people tested positive, many ended dying. time initial exposure, wearing PPE. able get tested testing shortage. told quarantine 14 days symptom free. able get antibody test month later tested positive IgG IgM antibodies. 

Now, almost 4 months later, tested positive PCR test. get tested weekly job last test, taken last Tuesday came back positive. I’m confused. I’m sure I’ve reinfected, never back March/April. far, I’m really symptoms exposure confirmed case. confirmed cases job month. it’s pandemic making absurd governors get heads straight I’m sure couple hurricanes make get shit together actually Florida. record, live Nova Scotia, Canada. entire province 1 active case. wear mask every time go grocery store, 95% public same. Deaths assisted living centers reason death toll high? percentage deaths think came care homes? New York highest death toll that's place Europeans interested going to. Florida excuse, they've four months prepare since NY still failed, lol. NY playing Another version story without paywall:  conservatives world older general? think ""back day didn't..."".

I'm a, general, progressive country, amount times late grandmother 'understand' gay people 'they back day' astonishing.   America going wait November. Hope trump voted begin start tackle pandemic  close friends refuse believe deadly flu Can't wait Republicans use justification shit Florida. issue isnt weather, rather fact people waltzing around maskless crowding every bar restaurant sight. often feel like insane person  season US, runs October May, claims tens thousands lives every year. season CDC estimates that, mid-March, 29,000 59,000 died due influenza illnesses. Add misery hundreds thousands flu-related hospitalizations millions medical visits flu symptoms 

That's US alone

So yes, sending kid school, infects kids continue spread around community, first parents work reaches old, susceptible people, chances going end deaths opposed sending kid school, breaking transmission chain. 

You're displaying astonishing level arrogance ignorance. craziest statement even context getting covid...wtf Reddit forgot science since COVID poped nothing aware. 

Has everything everybody separated miles dense forest trees. Reminiscent Reagan AIDS epidemic. Get program, MLB. hub city Canada Yup. Thinking same. can't fix stupid. fantasy world live in. sports teams playing empty stadiums national interest patriotism continue playing ball. high voluntary mask usage, highly educated, high focus healthcare access,

So saying is, could literally everyone morons. It’s coincidence place gave us Bernie Sanders.  Given what's going Portland lately.. sad. forget 3 months ago fraction cases see today. number reinfections see perfectly line probability getting infected 2 times 3 month span went meds lost job turns shitty job making depressed I’m cured! need win lottery something entire healthcare system already shortstaffed is, going find staff treat hotel setting. top that, nursing facilities exposed much increased risk due already infected covid. 

Everyone healthcare system trying brainstorm ideas best one came with. Fauci saying New York correctly vast majority healthcare workers front line height infection would agree.

Covid patients usually hospitalized around day 10 ready discharge two weeks month initial contact. time hospital system ready discharge patients, every single nursing facility swarming covid. Yes Netherlands many cases Biologically girls done development 16 boys 17 average. Height, bone structure, secondary sex characteristics, mostly finished. However, brain development finished alongside body development. brain finished girls 19 boys 21.

They taper off, course, actually finish mid-20s both, talking gradual finish, hard stop. Like roller coaster already finished main event taxiing end ride.

Saying *""the distinction child adult largely legal social construct""* bit mark. There's difference physiological development mental development. Plus, average true everyone. Many girls even get periods 15/16 others get 9. So, grain salt average age.

Brain development tends happen +/- 1.5 years average, generally stays closer pace development physical development. say, there's wider range ages body normally development physically brain development. 

The reason older legal age average physical development brain takes longer develop body. 

Specifically Dorsolateral section prefrontal cortex one last parts brain develop, finishing around 19 girls 21 boys. portion brain governs risk management, behavior, judgement, consequential reasoning. hand, Limbic system one first parts brain finish development, portion brain gives pleasure rewards novel experiences risk-taking behaviors succeed. 

This teenagers, whose Limbic systems fully developed, prone act seemingly without considering consequences. part brains give pleasure-reward fully developed, part analyze impacts consequences not.

Realistically, age adulthood probably match brain development since Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex helps people tell ""hang on, decision could serious impact life"" allows override pleasure sensation ""this gonna epic!""

On average, 16 year old girl finished developing filling body fat muscle density there. hips widened set, tallest close it, on. 17 year old boy typically shoulders fully broadened major growth plates hardened. muscle density increase body hair continue thicken (specifically facial hair), broadly speaking, he's physically developed.

It's unseen brain development matters more, however.  19 year old got first period 9 brain development level girl got first period 14. body development minimal impact mental maturation. Early bloomers late bloomers physically, matter.

---------

All said, pertains Covid-19, right, older teens essentially adults physically. 

However, hate people say said, adulthood ""social construct"" really not. 

If want say someone's adult body brain fully completely finished developing girls adults 23, boys 25. decided 18 variety reasons (I could go history, well past midnight post already fairly long). essentially age decided someone ""close enough"" completely developed responsible decision making. right magical line kid 11:59pm adult 12:00am 18th birthday. However, ""social construct"" older body finished puberty. boys girls, ""early bloomers"" speak, finished pubescent body changes even earlier. specific kid's puberty run course 14 mean brain matured rate body. can't expected ""more mature"" body mature.

Four completely different things, one get certificate name it. correct, Florida also generally insane. sure hell going get vaccinated soon can. vaccines getting proper safety efficacy testing. still going phase 3 trials carefully analyzed sign safety concerns thousands scientists. reason trials going quickly unprecedented funding work SARS MERS vaccines gave us head start. 

Besides someone else get guinea pig instead you? Saying let people get vaccinated first, prolonging pandemic don't, selfish. 10 probably 20 years ago, corruption gone way since dictator came power. I'm 4 hours south also 50/50. Ironically, older people ones wear masks. Everyone hates Pritzker here. can't wait leave place Even CNN’s latest nationwide update admitted Arizona one improving states... difference "" fear"" weakness"" cautious decent human being. Masks slightest inconvenience people go bezerk! Kind thinking. mean, virus world-wide. Deciding ""fake"" kind irrelevant point. governor make surprised pikachu face found out? study separates cases age intervals decades, get picture 0-9 year olds. found age group, transmission much less likely source. jibes [other looked elementary/daycare kids different way (in actual school/daycare settings). risk zero, daycare somewhat safe terms sparking COVID-19 clusters (but rare few, read link comment). Next study: people brown hair also spread virus! Good. bodes well border closure extensions. Bill Burr said, choices Trump Devil. reporting negatives positives positives negatives!”

So... evens out, figures correct? charge second degree murder  case motion looser normal whataboutism. Nice. It’s fine point. Probably lot nose reading re-infects/total infected. Whatever point you’re trying make is, you’re terrible job. Thing shits legitimate conspiracies even theories anymore get get lumped crackpot bullshit.  
When legitimate government/corporate shenanigans dismissed disregard invisible mind controlling laser beams subterranean reptilian pyramids bad guys win. article read weeks ago, here's something: population ~1,000. 100% seroconversion rate second shot. guess Reddit reports mostly progress related Moderna, likely China's vaccine track become publicly available year. What? statistics much virus *reduced* homeless jobless numbers NY? 

Because ever seen data like that, I've never even heard anyone make claim now. Incorrect. landscaping company work lost 4 employees due scenario. That’s know first hand though. remember alarm sounded somebody else's state True sad story. really never seen much ships (cruise, freight, tanker, bulk) parked sea... four cruise ships alone months now. Honestly, lots places done better NY. think he's praising turnaround places things earlier prevent numbers had. mean, achieving \~15% immunity let collapse R0 1.0? so, every state headed towards NY model Fauci nothing worry about. Less testing slow packed hospitals. hope know Even Trump allies think best thing fall step forward act like takes pandemic seriously again. buy ""I nothing hide track want"" stance. q anon nutjob want government warrantless wiretapping entire population building databases everyone. I'm aware phones lot work still restrictions. went Twitter exchanges. posting much unsourced data minimizing numbers. pushing wacky conspiracies, Jesus sign delusions. I'm going back. dark absurd. SF here, 

We first nation lockdown, still good mask/ distance awareness. Life goes on, people understand gravity situation. Wow that’s lot people. Dear Dr. Fauci, hero. Please don’t give fight. I'm sure interpret this. I'm saying able ""the people"" take seriously without government also so, ""the people"" can't afford stay home without support. According to... you?

You sound certain but, elected authority causes French Revolution complex still debated among historians. American Revolution helped set stage events French Revolution, shown France rebellion based Enlightenment principles, including natural rights equality citizens, authoritarian regime could succeed. German diplomat Friedrich von Gentz (1764-1832) observed treatise published France example undertaking, crowned complete success, must immediate powerful influence upon those, destroyed old government France, example earlier European revolution: circumstances, France was, breaking revolution, been, wholly, yet greatest part brought part taken America. conduct language founders French revolution, impossible perceive endeavour imitate course, plans, measures, forms, and, part, language those, conducted America; consider this, upon occasions, model, justification own.

So... right American revolution wasnt scope depth changes afterward - definitely ""happen far hemisphere"" laughable intentional distortion.

And also points severity French revolution subsequent ""Reign Terror"" consequences that.


- anyway, masks, good decision. Saw Nebraska well sufficient testing keep infection rates low enough proper contact tracing, possible.

Most US testing far behind number infections makes contact tracing impossible. Vermont put work early much better position it. careful fauci trump might think made fucky wucky saying put unlife box Really depends lot part Indiana go to, think. parts full masks, everyone wearing one, yet parts seem oblivious. know mandated live currently, weak mandate weakly enforced. Meth stare. build lasers. Lol. Pinky mouth. Austin Powers. oic, stand corrected.

PS: tits shall always remain jiggly, never calm.  23k deaths nearly 220k cases correctly? Dear God bar low rest country rising stock market magically make disappear. That's bold strategy cotton. I’ve often found dashboard isn’t always consistent PDF report. second chart PDF report, chart I’ve taken tracking, shows much worse picture state announces. today it’s 14k, highest date past two weeks resulting 19k positive tests.

Sorry America, bad. Illinois 12 million people 1100 new cases daily.

Arizona 7 million people 4000 new cases daily.

South Carolina 5 million people 2000 new cases daily.

Florida almost 2x population (21 million) yet 10x amount (11000) new cases daily.

So, yeah Illinois petty good. someone points restabilizes people rush correct mistake also realize really make sense. 

I've noticed this.

Someone -4 karma semi-controversial topic (I guess borderline mer) reading comment, replied back saying, ""I get downvoted"" used rational arguments sources reinforce position.

He came +100 karma end. said least six times NYC's population density, size influx travelers right closure (all three far away biggest country) dealt hand probably unwinnable, metric adapted responded thereafer. biggest curve nation flatten... again, probably inevitably... *and so*, looks like (so far) successful reopening strategy.

This is, coincidentally, Fauci talking post.

So want make fair comparison, adjust it. Unless really fair.

Lol. places, Denmark, Finland Norway, that’s easy understand. Covid-19 outbreaks relatively contained, among lowest death tolls world. low mask adoption doesn’t necessarily signal policy failure. all, masks one tool among many, they’re means panacea health authority discouraged mask wearing healthy people going normal lives, questioning effectiveness saying “can cause harm good.” concerns people cover mouth nose may let guard face coverings may even become vector virus mishandled. don’t know 10, requested here, yes. say weren't. said ""our own repulsion bodies,"" hence something let affect you.

Wear masks people! Social distance! thing serious! Also I'd say financial package quite easily best generous package government far.

Mine usually come back minutes tell me, “The nurse said come back 15 minutes still don’t feel good.” inevitable, “Has 15 minutes yet?” question every two minutes. Question caused anxiety:

My grandmother went surgery last week recently developed fever. wound red possibly infected nurse assumed that's fever came from. Either way Covid19 test case since symptom.

That two days ago today came back negative. I'm wondering could false negative. known show positive much later symptoms? want visit baby I'm scared.

If child young online learning isn’t effective, delaying education year won’t make much difference ultimately. countries don’t teach reading age 7, 5, comes wash. 

Older kids engage well online learning. It’s perfect, it’s like they’re left rot. Meanwhile Florida... downside people accidentally spreading virus. 
The upside(?) people stay away sensible less likely get it. Well yes, US respects guns unborn fetuses actual children. par respect money workers' lives. really fucked priorities here. mean whatever takes people take personal responsibility make sacrifices right surely someone come save Simpson children! sorry. Every yearbook country going page dedicated ""hero"" teachers lost lives trying make living crap wages.

How pay better?? Well, police, hope afford security. 

Technically better say mask purchase. force purchase felony least police still respond (so far). I’m actually getting engineering degree currently (non-traditional student, I’m old figured still worth lol). I’m pretty worried potentially going back in-person classes; much students, professors. risk really don’t think depend college kids needs done spread it. would tragedy lose percentage educators.

They're *teachers,* yeah, makes sense. They're taking risks free babysitters. 

Now, let's see non-teacher moms stand up. Parents want send kids school despite risks problem. We've concentration camps years genocide American people secret police. think we're there. would media politicians backed start. president wore mask first time *last week*. Absolutely irresponsible. Again, deflecting actual issue we're talking - save lives pandemic. we'll years road... So, disagree them, going wear mask matter principal? noble you. like extremely selfish. Agreed, I'm nearly 6'2"" adult size *until 14*.

I even believe guy child. agree places cases low risk spread low (maybe NJ green states) MIGHT able open.

Well shit lol think need something like *Tips Former Smokers* Campaign, scary, honest Thank proving point. got you.[archive link anyone trouble accessing article think words used ""very dark winter"" Oh gosh. I've fan Fauci, ludicrous. New York has, currently, worst record state fighting virus. even close.

Now, watching states like AZ Florida flail around, knows, perhaps states end similar death tolls despite massive early bungling cost 10's thousands lives, NY look better comparison.

But NY even average (80 deaths per 100k ) we'd something like 264,000 deaths. knows, might get there. :(

But NY going case study future ""What pandemic approaching"" power struggle bad blood de Blasio Cuomo particularly think studied completely handicapped early responses meant states like California Ohio taking seriously much earlier, NY not. months passed majority people experienced mild symptoms surely taking much precautions before. 

This ridiculous assumption, likely reverse. People take antibody tests assumption get disease millions people still minimal fraction population 6 months still short timeframe

Why fact small percentage global population matter terms disease enough data say something anectodal not. 

Articles explaining individual stories potential reinfection anecdotal definition. Lower antibody count couple weeks post infection super normal. Immunnology complicated. put way eli5: stop producing lot antibodies body thinks dont need them. get reinfected, body replicates cells make antibodies fast. Crazy fast.

 Grandson going College later Summer/Fall semester. that’s always been, always be, life tho. Daycares hospital workers (and places pharmacy grocery store employees) never closed. unlike, churches sports, haven’t heard daycare breakouts. ""unfortunately"" (sounds like shoulder shrug ""what ya gonna do?"") means teacher git bad cold week, could mean: teacher died.

It's ok.

Until assured parents sending sick kids, school cannot reopen.

Teachers die going work. hold fellow citizens account.

Some try. People asking people mask stores..... getting guns drawn them. 

FFS America. realize donkeys much risk COVID. abolished penny....

were supposed find 4206900 them? Yeah, controlling number refrigerator trucks lined behind hospitals going get tricky. people wore masks and, know, masks reduce chance infection greatly people wear them. 

Some districts opening “mask optional” policies students quell fears anti-mask parents. 

The teachers support staff districts don’t stand chance, especially many give feverish kid glug Children’s Tylenol shove em onto bus anyway treat school like daycare. Yes think lot knowledge needs done. Masks, distancing class lunch. kids teachers high risk high risk people homes make accomodations. Btw congrats 4 year old wears mask properly, kids age could see happening. general suck people apoplectic wearing people professional aggrievers. There's always something someone oppressing them. Let's hope do. meltdown videos great content. Wait. Middle high schoolers humans? they’ve Texas past 3 month? Improving freezer truck mortuary truck.
Instead learning put masks. Jesus every move white house took virus wrong move, takes talents consistently fuck every step lmao It’s question safety. It’s question community’s safety. prohibit 21+ y.o. adults going bars, it’s safety slows spread.

Saying “the risk small enough I’m comfortable action” valid reason allow action done. must consider risk others well.  kind studies done?  bunch pricks... don’t understand important small store nice weekend boat trips? one won’t get anything. can’t bothered care people, least consider means yourself...

Also:
Could someone please explain ADA mask exemption is? believe Sweden closed schools elementary level.   8 hour waits? That's cute.

My coworker got line 4am didnt get tested 6pm.

Our country joke. majority people Florida fine job DeSantis doing, suppose chose move away Florida unhappy political representation getting. 

America Democracy, Democracy, chose leaders peoples' votes , whether qualified job not. didn’t seem sarcastic thought another Karen There's backlog 100,000 cases, they're processing 7,000 tests day lately. two week lag time. third 40 large companies seeking U.S. bankruptcy protection coronavirus pandemic awarded bonuses executives **within month filing cases**, according Reuters analysis securities filings court records.

Is necessarily sensationalist began this? later paragraph bonuses paid within longer time conflict part. Serious question.

I unfortunately live people aren’t taking virus seriously position it’s pretty much confirmed I’ll get disease. it’s true causes long term damage majority patients, what’s point? don’t think could live knowing whatever life altering effects could prevented simply able live myself. people voted specifically *because* gives fucks thought awesome. reaping they've sown. Unfortunately, they've pulled rest country them. That's true seems like wishful thinking. Behavioral factors could well offset point making much worse.

First, cases black people getting virus, must suggest sort immunity. cases young people catching dying it, must mean old people disease. Now, cases people getting reinfected, must mean exceedingly rare.

The thing novel virus grows exponential rate still learning every new scenario necessarily start cases. realize private security instructed corporate remind customers wear masks, given power authorization intervene customers comply right?

I'll put simply, corporation gives shit you, public welfare, pandemic. abstract, amoral entity exists solely profit. conscience, concessions health science. raw profit. security theater designed make customers feel safe, allow deny culpability future lawsuits may filed them. excuse. Sucks peoples actions effect others though Yeah sick long term sure government supports available insurance. antibody test. irony prior pandemic, many reports highlighted dangers social media regard mental health. No, people take seriously even think real. months passed majority people experienced mild symptoms surely taking much precautions before. 12 millions people still minimal fraction population 6 months still short timeframe, enough data say something anectodal not. come right upset Obama stopped testing h1n1, much less serious pandemic


But want Trump stop testing covid?


Is political? like Obama cause different party? skin color? they're sending people states' hospitals can't handle AZ. also flu going around. clients healthcare workers dreading winter. Theyre going get slammed. first year get flu shot chance get it. doctors office/urgent care last place want safety sanity employees. Soviet Russia, virus vaccine! husband said knows guy work says knows three people died listed COVID death certificate cause death. guy still thinks it’s hoax outraged lying cause death. I’ve lost hope morons ever believe... mask service.

Just like shirt shoes service.

Problem get asshole says I'm buying anything I'm going walk around without mask. problem theory would mean easier transmit dark think we've seen yet. 

I think literally, hard get outside nothing heat. Unless talking extremes, like sanitizing levels heat. 

Sunlight kill virus surface though. Seriously. grew broke halfway decent. last 10 years I've worked foreclosure. I've bought bunch tools work house cars. know bunch people wont use tools save $300 couple hours. know people wont take free tools go get cheap house work on. problem 4 month long lockdown shuttered many businesses good. desperately feel doctors, nurses healthcare workers support workers hotspots. 

I can't imagine stress. ""Actually, thing worried Coronavirus problem need someone watch kids year."" worry, schools open, number going go down. stop thing, companies separate pool sick days employees forced take ill effect them. 

My company great terrific benefits, even there, sick days holidays pool. sick week, that's week can't take see friends family holidays. looks pure silicone picture. I’ve found opposite! Yes no.

I speak Christian cosmology I’m sure Jewish cosmology.

But Christian cosmology:

The angel Lucifer’s role lightbringer Lucifer angels Fall. 

After Fall rebel angels became set God heavenly armies stopped anything normal before. 

They came despise material creation, light part creation. material sense Lucifer longer bears light meaning name literal.

They also despise humans humans incredibly inferior angels intellect, power. rebel angels fell, fell humans cosmic hierarchy beings.

But humans are, lack better description, incredibly stupid weak compared angels demons saw afront became set causing humanity devour inside turn God. 

They see humans less humans see insects.

They set sewing confusion, greed, fear selfishness among humans eroding human morale aspiration.

So metaphorical light Lucifer done bringing light, recruits humans undoing accuses worthless inferior. 

He wants enxtinguish light hope, aspiration love (in moral, active sense emotional sense) using human reason perverse purposes. 

If still carries light might metaphorical light revelation nowadays he’s bent revealing brokenness humanity blinding dispair. 

Whereas subset non-fallen angels bent guarding light holding space humans spiritually self actualize become like degree.

The rest angels probably don’t much humans universe vast. 

But Lucifer doesn’t really new title specific per se.

“Satan” original sense word like said also refer general sense persecutor malicious intent. real thing? thought made Mad Men. you’re saying there’s chance?  saw party highschool older dancing extremely close. realize sound like old marm, fuck... Great! Show study evidence reinfection anywhere even close sort prevalence I'd glad read it. Two months ago seemed like Reddit wearing masks hypothesis touch face transmit virus further. think makes much intuitive sense I've never heard logic applied masks they've proven effective else use. Honestly think Reddit trying come bullshit excuse wear one Reddit much stubborn they'd like admit. kind shook trust platform nearly everyone seemed board idea, including little while. I'm happy narrative died likely cost lives. Misinformation very, dangerous days. Remind happens school gets every day? forget. Put tape valve outside. Doctors take oath enter profession take oath very, seriously.  sounds like plan school district Mecklenburg county NC. We’ve got highest case count state, CMS going plan least get chrome books kids didn’t spring kind fell radar. 

I pray colleagues teachers stay safe healthy. course kids too...as parent goes without saying. 

But started, conversation centered kids getting sick made mad. really devalued lives teachers staff, treating part school building, living, breathing humans families own, pre-existing conditions own. Thankfully lot narrative swung around focus teachers staff finally, fear it’s enough. Ooo, didn’t even think jam. going throw dried cherries love so, jam would even better would swirl around. Thanks idea! remember constantly school kid point remember one kid sneezing 2+ inch diameter sized glob green snot desk next me. Like sure felt like massive relief, hell? Unfortunately happens parents can't afford take work take care sick kid norm lower class parents.     cousin lives spins every way, say numbers made up. fairness, also said 85 babies tested positive another State, purposely infected financial political reasons. craziness! Tell illegals, moron. read them, look Eli Saslow's CV stories Post. genuinely moving. Hey I’m much stay home, lockdowns, fact it’s insane people making unemployment otherwise. BUT, careful. Saying returning work likely removes unemployment benefits. employer asked offered work say yes, you’re hosed. need peer reviewed articles “reinfections.”

I haven’t seen posted /r/covid19 subreddit.

The ones recall seeing deal South Korean reinfections tests detecting dead viral material. chance. people aren’t taking seriously simply dismiss COVID somebody else’s problem. They’re convinced sick elderly kick bucket. anything, lot people feel emboldened knowing statistically unlikely die. Compare Spanish flu younger people susceptible serious illness. honestly think COVID giving people false sense invulnerability. sensitivity specificity. matters. I’m marveling stupid is.

In order selectively give charity choices must made. communities won’t make cut b because, uh, many white people

I can’t explain simpler that. Same. actually used RemindMeBot one posts month ago someone saying reopening going anything bad. soon reminder came up, went back see say. Here's went.

Paraphrasing here.

OP comment 1 month ago: Lockdowns stupid. Evidence shows good. Social distancing along take care this. can't destroy economy something work anyway.

My comment 1 month later 40,000 cases day: Yeah, aged like shit.

Them: Nuh uh! testing! people charge make masks requirement

What boggles mind ones like governor Georgia make masks mandatory, literally blocked local governments instituting mandatory mask policies... Nobody invincible. interesting, labeled USA? study South Korea. Wow holy sh\*t discovery century swear guys getting funding nothing. Everyone get common cold XD wonder long took figure Less republicans. result of, testing positive. There’s contract sign don’t test positive.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let's dumb even inbred among us.

You get punched nose. nose breaks. tell attacker, ""You broke nose!""

Now, Mr. Incompetent, clear person broke nose *know* person broke nose? know there's causal connection punching nose nose breaking, coincidence nose broke punched you? think would happened punched nose. punched nose, nose broken moment.

That's called counterfactual. Counterfactual analysis basis causal inference--looking would happened, outcome would been, things different making comparison outcomes.

Now, that's exactly we'd like here. want know approach would result higher death tolls New York: New York's approach Sweden's approach. know death toll New York New York approach using reporting standards. That's one outcome. Great.

But want see another outcome make comparison: New York's death toll would followed Swedish approach. want see counterfactual figure method would led higher death toll.

That's dumbed feeling even went head.

Of course, that's say that, public policy standpoint, deaths matter making decision. time explain entirety someone two brain cells.

As logic real world datasets useless many variables.

It's ""too many variables."" forming valid counterfactual. purely observational studies, done using two groups are, hopefully, identical highly similar meaningful ways prior ""treatment"" applied. sisters used studies economic effect pregnancy usually meaningful similarities (e.g. household grew in, access resources, etc.). purist, says. done sorbet, wasn’t winner him, honestly, think salt ice cream craving/finding satisfying. owned general contracting business worked outside sweating day, think ice cream made truly feel better salt depleted? mean, get trail mix... never really liked ice cream begin makes thirsty eat it.   argument, person give attention care entire shirt, even though rest may need it. 

False

I said people need help deserve get fucking help. ""rest shirt"" need help, get it. ANYONE needs help, get access it. long indoor bars, restaurants, gyms closed

They've reopened several weeks. parents pick get extreme close contact. wish many get point realize serious.  Really? people personally know who’ve gotten it, none family members contracted it, varying degrees separating household members illness. I’d say 15-20 people. never really thought one meant all. anyone house we’re get really don’t separation plan, depending severity course.
Hopefully won’t get though. They'll say pictures fake... 

FFS people still believe Sandy Hook shooting faked. Sorry, slept history class. Could explain connection Robespierre 100 hours? no. Trump said kids magic can't get teachers nothing worry about. can't right! sorry. truly sorry hope family make full healthy recovery. Young kids protected group around world haven’t chance spread like adults yet. 

Unless cite something say true, I'd guess bullshit. face claim absurd. Millions parents school age children got it, somehow give children lockdown with?

What's almost every major COVID hotspot COVID cases predating first comfirmed case month uncovered. obviously means virus circulating freely long time one taking precautions, let alone pulling kids school.

I think claim popularized help explain children seem resistant COVID without invoking spectre of, gasp, *preexisting immunity*. parents pick come close contact. literally cough mouths open wipe snot everywhere. Students overall empathetic?! Haha! ask parents feel this. truly know student act. Parents nuts... really thing? People think before? need get funding study drinking water makes go pee. nonsense. I'm Finland know long good luck last. almost restrictions gone feels like living old normal many people forgotten pandemic. nightclubs open again, superspreading events likely occur (like Switzerland example). Without guest lists corona app tracing going difficult. think summer weather somehow lessens symptoms people get tested much low numbers, although new cases popping country usually can't traced known case. numbers common cold infections starting increase, people less careful.

I hope cases start explode get kind mask mandate least public transport. I'm hoping first wave enough, many countries Europe seem already experiencing start second wave (e.g. Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Catalonia, maybe even Switzerland). know restaurants etc. going survive closed again.

Regarding situation long-term sufferers Sweden, know could kind civil action lawsuit Swedish government least demand kind investigation over. would lived Nordic country, would probably 10-times less likely contracted disease government acted start like flu ignored science says clearly virus similar SARS. known many SARS survivors long term damage. I'm actually bit surprised low IFR since virus seems dangerous SARS paper (from start highly human-adapted RBD, furin cleavage site, etc.). Bible reference gilead’s balm comes from? Yes. Schools essential pay school taxes. think disrespectful call teachers babysitters. Hearing many new cases Canadian praires Hutterite colonies. Never asked went hill fast 3 days getting symptoms vent. able talk us said wish took seriously wasnt stupid. skip bars restaurants really, “we’re full” sentiment toxic bullshit. Native sticker car too?

I joking. I'm relatively recent immigrant too. Articles like piss two reasons:

1. People COVID deniers use bait try make people take seriously even though case clearly even related disease, least proven be

2. COVID deniers use fuel show media lying number deaths inflated conspiracy crap.

This need media start integrity. report facts, bad enough need dishonest make seem worse. shit! almost like humans Yes, indeed seem obvious statement. However, Dutch health organization RIVM concluded young kids increased spreading virus Holland, since primary schools reopened. Initially, reopened 50 percent kids one day, remaining kids day, 2/3 weeks without major spikes, schools reopened fully. Also without significant increase spreading. can't really get mind around possible, I'll leave link find one English.

Edit: [found evidence causes long lasting damage majority cases. believed around 40% cases asymptomatic. cases serious symptoms definitely risks long term damage, seen vetted research claiming it’s high percent. Even it’s hard say it’s COVID alone causes it, it’s due vitamin deficiency comorbidities interacting, treatment stop disease resulted complication. don’t know. Don’t stress people can’t parse known versus speculated without hard evidence.

It’s definitely risk, spreading message majority causes lasting problems without backing up, even it’s speculation. need take virus seriously, WAY many people overly paranoid spread fear here. many people anxious way many people panicking necessary. I’m saying concern, thing paranoid anxious thing Vote sheriffs office refuse protect lives

Seen stores appointments , door locked wise. **Florida reported 12,400 new cases Sunday, bringing state's total 350,000** 

 **The state reported 87 new virus-related resident deaths, bringing total 4,982 since outbreak began** 

 **Miami-Dade Broward combined accounted 35% Sunday's new cases** Holy fuck, that's fucking evil. even articulate thoughts that. bought world's supply remdesivir blackmail hospitals? add berry jams cocoa. 

Ginger cinnamon too, temper blood sugar response bit. So, state they're skipped claim?? 

Go ahead, admit wrong. Innate immunity recognize virus specific molecular structures recognizes ""generic"" pathogen damage associated molecular patterns. Coronaviruses common. 

Adaptive immunity adaptive constantly mutates antibodies cell receptors insane rate random chance match virus bacteria. type immunity inherited although shared Mother child womn outside (through milk) limited period time.

So part immune system inherited part recognizes ""sars-cov-2"" specifically. innate immune system cells absolutely recognize coronavirus otherwise would able gobble present adaptive immune cells. Definitely forget hit reply. analogy fucking sucks. Unless want government control dick, make required citizens always wear condom. Weather STD not. unless agree law, try harder. Studies still done. looking virus behave children. Beijing little ago, basically means sending surge teams massive testing contain outbreak problem schools designed make following safeguards possible. 

Here elements make impossible high school teach in:

* 2000 students walking hallways shoulder shoulder passing periods. 

* 30 kids classroom sitting 18 inches apart.

* Poor ventilation/air exchange. classrooms windows. Even window, windows dont open. know poor air exchange cause smelly student 1st hour, seventh hour students mention smell walk door---long become acclimated it. 

Aside that, think pediatricians, politicians, parents tend see/interact children individually small groups. children large groups one becomes capable laying aside EVERYTHING know right/correct/moral/smart sake misguided attempt get attention (positive negative) members group. I've seen high schoolers lick desks window glass. share unwrapped food bare hands. share drinks lollipops, share gum intimate acquaintances. 

As teacher, terrified wont survive year. shown pictures videos people still say fake part, European countries start opening things back virus already quite low levels population.

So go everything open right now? probably many walking asymptomatic infect others. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* saw lot well. kids really needed working online, much like person, chose to. called texted parents frequently, high school lot habits parent/kid dynamic pretty locked in. 

My district took policy work optional already passing, kids already passing we're satisfied grade chose participate. blame kids, high school aged participated optional either. kids passing really needed logged on, good number really took advantage online time. kids totally shut classroom get online. mean, could make room Texans went home. 

But really, “we’re full” sentiment toxic bullshit. Native sticker car too? west know stop joking tragedy? need oversight money, glad federal taxes next 30 years paying bumfuck Missouris tourism industry people actually pay bills. Right? wearing mask public, that’s endangering yourself. Going store spitting cashiers? intentionally malevolent. It’s...evil.


Edit: agree people correcting me. wearing mask *does* put people around risk. It’s selfish, opposed malicious. Spitting people whole nother level.  kept schools open kids 16. Black brown communities specifically vulnerable covid also tend far poorer. significant amount COVID deaths comprised minorities.

Imagine stain shirt. part shirt needs attention dirtier rest shirt. put extra care washing stain.

By argument, person give attention care entire shirt, even though rest may need it. 

Communities need help receive help. That's it. favoring people color white people

Edit: typos Huh? responding right comment? accurate post I’ve ever seen here. would gold it. school symptom policy, anyone symptom allowed school, send home immediately symptom. closed two weeks March many home us motivate open. kids school since early March, due allergies. kids arent expected back October pollen problem anymore.  Teach save I’m bringing $1000/week less usual. 4th grade taller mom (she’s 5’6”), wore larger shoe size (she’s size 7), weighed (she around 130-140). tallest kid class 2nd 6th 7th grade. I’m female lol. 

Big kids — fp due inhaling virions patients (pcr sensitive) meant along lines ‘righteous’ ones tend ‘leave God’s hands’ fatalistic way. Lots ways help ones self. Community one. think also interpreted imply perceive God around us. testing contact tracing place suppress outbreaks lot people area. Business slower was, lot people lose jobs. people went back keep jobs. would want looking work middle this. Parent here, who’s job gives unlimited sick time self family. 

When kindergarten (age 5-6 non US reddit), kept kid home every fever, every productive cough days, every pink eye (allergy bacterial). sent picture evidence contact teacher time, twin babies home thanked me. got truancy letter. 

Because schools don’t get federal funding days students aren’t attendance.

I’m saying parents don’t abuse system. system doesn’t work direction either. read links still fein ignorance, know probably hopeless conversation since mind made unmovable. 

But essentially, economy tanked hard similar countries massively deaths. Water wet  Sure can. also wait post story actual cause death. People die random shit every day. *WHEN LEARN CONSEQUENCES ACTIONS*  Trump responsible bad things supporters do, mean left responsible division, destruction murders caused BLM protesters bad things done? live Boston, masks folks outside esplanade. hell would anyone wear mask outside? Yeah, issue. confident government steal vaccine. probs there. Whether produce mass scale another question. Science denying republicans enemy. fighting two pandemics. Ignorance COVID. someone post text? Walmarts door people may well cardboard cutouts person speech bubble asking wear mask. arguably worse TSA. It’s “required” retailer work for. signs up. employees vendors required wear plus go daily screening process. we’ve explicitly told many times employees enforce rule let signs speak themselves. Mostly it’s safety thing, we’ve seen videos. I’m sure it’s partly sales thing too. Don’t want turn away money. there? worried people Bengladesh taking purchasing power coming  That's I've wondering too. Breathing breath going spread matter age it. also makes groups believe likely get it. much misleading information. Fauci one making sense communicating factual helpful information. nobody gives single shit. 

What talking about? Look news program website, see day number covid cases fatalities. obviously many Americans care this. 

What issue reached consensus best strategy dealing covid balances public health individual rights. America authoritarian country. going place Americans house arrest, like Australia doing, keep covid control. accept type draconian actions government like Australians are. Wearing mask Walmart akin shirt, shoes service. You’re choosing customer. Wearing monitor time without committing crime violating quarantine much different. Also, contract even valid it’s coercion. Monopoly  long get grounded killing people? Could also moderately sick people staying home little longer avoiding hospitals...home deaths rise.

Edit: moderately sick turned away told go back home (as someone else pointed below) best explanation pool testing I've read.

Upvoted. I’m kidding. Love Fauci. Cause idea could replace remain complacent. Also live political echo chamber democracy king policies share ideas communism/socialism automatically 10000% communism/socialism makes people react like 1960s  You’re exactly right. (and still am) one people. brain goes Homer Simpson hamster wheel simple math problem work out. 

Once got prime numbers, factoring such, brain checked out, teachers (they super old cranky back then) didn’t try help, parents behind even level. 

I bare minimum pass graduate. kids grateful teach math way understand. Parents get huffy “new math” taught way school, wouldn’t check given up. 

Now regret missed higher science classes require foundation mathematics. I’m fascinated physics lot concepts seem like magic peasant lack basic mathematical understanding. 

But making damn sure kids don’t. Good luck degree! Big time. It’s fine line walk. Trump planned candidate Democrats? really think party issue rather outcome everything pressed black/white red/blue scheme without recognition facts science common goal. either side get 'Trump' here... certainly wish nothing best health. think sharing food etc behavioral reason school, think kids adjust have, say parent teenage boys dumbest shit. 
The logistics challenges mentioned tough. thoughts? 100 percent online? actually graded traditional learning? 
Hybrid approach? 'only' 1000 kids rather 2000 school given day rest home? White House isn’t filtering state publicly releases daily data Clearly, don’t teenagers. 😁 brilliant. people need read work. say, never realized CPR damaging body read posts....yikes. Yeah I'd like see New Mexico numbers, especially state border study finnish schools reopening Water wet. Amazing display ignorance. article explains approach simply doesn’t work following tale alien encounters true. true, mean false. lies. they're entertaining lies. end, real truth? answer is: No. think you’re 100% accurate. bad they’ve voting consistently cut public health rural hospitals. Listening moronic reality tv star lips permanently affixed ass instead medical professionals. Ask shall receive. Apparently people don’t understand humans sizes fact exhale air lungs.

The stupidity required think virus can’t transmitted child astounding. 

Here’s criteria transmission:
1: virus
2: Breathe virus particles 

That’s it. 

Unless honestly understand children fact lungs breathe air don’t understand logic died young. It’s like asking everyone needs vaccine (although course scientific data supporting universal vaccines much bigger cholesterol drugs).

I know cardiologist says something similar, don’t think big prospective trials showing use drugs healthy people. really is/should be.

I understand non biology major forgotten fact looking immunity works, someone points out, fact come back them.

This high school level stuff. I'm large male flensing knife tongue, dealing terrorists old woman co-morbidity... I'd crisis location - WTF here? many parts country everyone wears mask people generally *nicer* other. Wow. Proof still here, folks. made horrible mistake saying effects old people us stupid fucking Americans take whole-ass interstate give us inch That's actually crush 0 affordable cost. Okay, right, looked up, closed upper secondary, equivalent US 10th, 11th, 12th. I'm sure reasoning concerned students spreading concerned exposed it, students grades moving child range young adult range. means usual way, according normal protocols. 43 days till September 1, would need average 1400 deaths per day. Deaths Friday ~950, it’s possible would likely need 2-2.5k day weeks August.   sums nicely “I first, stupid transplants go home” attitude many people here.

I mind attitude. amusing. in...middle high schoolers indeed humans. 11  Em, shit Sherlock? Insult away! haven’t seen 8 years, saw Facebook rants.
I agree, pandemic certainly highlights lack intelligence, critical thinking skills, common sense, many. Probably even effectively, considering general personal hygiene employed middle high schoolers “There almost cough,” Cheng said. “The fever gone three days passed.””

This sounds lot like MIL. various symptoms, none severe cause worry, vitals measured fine hospital (both admittance discharge), though tested positive rapid test sent home isolate. next day checked oxygen level home habit suddenly got reading 83, despite fact mild symptoms point day normal oxygen reading hospital. went back hospital verified oxygen levels dropped dangerously low (organ failure statets occurring 80) said gone sleep day without getting hooked oxygen would woken next day.  It’s rest world needs ban travel US, mate.  kills virus surfaces though, still transmitted pretty easily via droplets breath people Unpleasant Truths line getting hit rocks everyone else. Full spectrum CBD added bonuses morons believe hoax continue someone know gets it, honestly point considering think all. 
Let’s honest, young healthy people probably spread more, able convince selves nothings wrong longer period time, contacting people, Visiting family friends,and spreading. problem America Responsible empathetic? Aren’t children kids “you can’t make wear mask” crowd? Wisconsin nobody wear masks, matter age.... ever. Cause lol diseases liberal hurr durr  White House takes control Covid stats, miracle ensues. started sending patients new mexico last week sure could see previous comment, removed political guess.

Anyways apologies picking sarcasm.

It’s hard really “I first, stupid transplants go home” attitude many people here.

Anyways hope enjoying great state!!

Cheers. That's lysogenic viruses. viruses trick integrate DNA yours. takes special enzyme, reverse transcriptase, viruses have.

COVID-19 lysogenic. would known quickly based enzymes makes. Sorry I'm new visitor sub, Oxford paper theory smaller people carry smaller viral loads. course, small kids active, possibly better distributing virus. tell 14 year old socially distance going work 6 year old.

The research much needed order give basic information politicians simply choosing expedient. really hoping case back April. blindly believe would, would nice surprise. take 10 days get test results doesn’t seem like much cooperation contact tracers. doubt outbreak would eventually brought control, many deaths/medical bankruptcies? work nursing home - son one infect whole school bring home infect him? one live killing teacher? Suppressing outbreak lives irreparably destroyed doesn’t kids teachers much good. Good News everyone! People dying steady rate now! Look survival rate. It’s pandemic, course people die. Every human planet get disease. pretty good gonna lie lol data ""properly"" filtered now. anyone listen her? hope so. trying save lives. 3x population Arizona goes reporting testing 30 percent positive yesterday 14 percent today.....

maybe people would take weekend day get tested, take time work? Lol, interesting deaths flu auto accidents, defending argument changed ""uh, freedom pls"" called teen pregnancy? source? common sense. school since March/April summer, chance spread school building hundreds sometimes thousands people congregate close quarter 8 straight hours come home metal capsule filled students various classrooms/grade levels families take workplace grocery store whatever. That's family member scenario presented. shielded major spreader events happen many many times day consistently throughout students return school person. Yep exact way, however indicator tall fuck later believe stopped growing height around 10yrs old.  also went puberty way early 8. kid school could grow thick ass boarding Indidnt shave skipped peach fuzz phase lol. imho every district forced comply Denver's example..... hope global pandemic made people knowledgeable geography... that's recitst DeSantis like DeSastre (disaster Spanish). 

LOCK US DOWN! Normal Floridians scared crazy Floridians. need state wide mandate mask lockdown order. One people manage straight honest “ didnt temperature check month, called saying im ok”

seeing colleagues blatantly don’t care social distancing pull masks break even hang outside masks off.

this covid still spreading. remember working isn’t customers thats covid. fellow colleagues it

note: didn’t punish employee, instead told them. guys notice one us sick? clear who.
- lectured experience bitch, shes great teacher, terrible teaching think things control got infected months ago - we’re everything right great example follow. “Don’t mess Texas...” unless you’re global pandemic; it’s whatever we’ll pretend everything fine send kids back school **while simultaneously order refrigerated trucks dead.**

Oh we’ll scream right wear masks. Also, remember Alamo, something. 


...I could use extraction. Gotcha, that's thought. seems lot hypocrisy going here. anyone who’s tested positive found medication helps vomiting?

My doctor put odanestron 4mg every 6 hours worked first. it’s day 6 I’m getting relief maybe first hour half taking day. relief night. 

I’m sleeping night anymore it’s really getting mentally. 

But least can’t taste it. Genetics skin colour it? Despite masking, Korea contained large outbreak early applying Chinese science methodology. Methodology testing, contact tracing, quarantining close contacts. 

Don’t apply politics realm public health policy here. like Taiwan China. 

Our public health experts work together much usual geopolitics allows us envision. scientists doctors working together common goal. Oh, right detection. still need account 45 PCR cycles, would 32 minutes one poster mentioned. Damn Bernie building wall keeping us out. 

/s   correctly killing weak people quickly beginning slow-footed response, shipping infected patients nursing homes resulted enormous number deaths. still deaths state huge margin. guy say anything correctly beyond comprehension. I'm sure glad live sane country. Germany, way. think adding quite lot lionization this. Yes considered heroes. No, don’t think supermarket workers transit drivers often think “Today, going make difference.” I've got good chunk friends act like care spreading pandemic, yet find excuses somehow end parties, friendly gatherings, travel intercity using train - wonder parents sick. kind normative behavior made despair apathy friends. Go hide Vermont rest year, got also super easy hit absentee limits cases. get sickness day two. maximum amount days could absent whole year 14 days significantly higher schools low 3 days.

It takes 2 weeks fully get sickness really takes around 3 days average, 5 get back business bad cold. Often times, I've take single day two get fever stuffy nose stage come back coughing stage. can't imagine kids would able survive district limits kids say, 5 days absence max per school year. kids start catching coronavirus, especially symptoms particularly bad, pressure getting penalty absent due sickness going cause come school spread anyways. guess Japan Sinks 2020 documentary... Yup. went effort it’s hoax New York kids can’t get masks don’t work. fucking insane. actual fuck It’s quite expensive actually housing crisis pretty bad too. definitely visit get chance! new Zealand international airport links multiple covid hotspots?

All European hotspots centered around major international airports, direct flights Ireland. importing cases Italy France anyone even knew spreading Europe. thing happened New York, travel Europe responsible majority outbreak.

New Zealand relatively lucky. MICRO-KILLING Yes. called ""Nothing Burger"". One fall backs (R)'s. happy 9/11. thought owned tallest building Manhattan. likes remembering joys. downward trend deaths since 1990. curiosity, state in? talking lockdown 2 weeks government actually it. Meanwhile massive church services allowed, already produced many many new cases. Testing slow. Measures slow enforced.

While neighboring Czech Republic mandated masks everyone beginning, Germany nobody asked mask went supermarket, 6000 cases per day.

Germany got way cases could've had. Taking everyone scary. people barely impacted yet others get completely floored it, reason It’s like Trump wants Democrats win election No, doubling down. new ones seen asked ""why requiring masks waves, think that"" feel like everyone forgotten GLOBAL issue. every country get together conspiracy work countries really like us right now? people really ok thousands people dying right I'm idiot Hey neighbour, wished would taken more. also took people Italy. 


Right now, germany people think, Covid bad, hospitals empty, high excess mortality all.. think done much. get it. happy, country managed ths crisis good far, no, complain it.

I also heard people say, prefer cross border go shopping netherlands, mandatory masks. friend sent one. Can't buy new filters thought... Gas give depression, careful. Turns there's huge amount dumb people. I'd extremely grateful news source/s Catalonia Spain general could considered reliable... could recommend any, please? Right?

Guy paranoid-delusional...

""Friend"", pretends friend 40 years.

What. The. Fuck.

RIP bandaid. think it’s getting upvotes you’ve added source. questions stupid. Fellow Redditers: meat???? Yeah true! That's crazy. either I'm definitely ""not proud American"" loss smell taste common symptom COVID-19, [some fatigue may associated too.

I suggest getting test calling doctor done yet. get violated typically get picked anything cleared up, that’s nature order. violated, go jail hearing. I’ve seen exact scenario, guy took wife hospital, violated, proof there. still sat jail 3 weeks revocation hearing ultimately released back parole. 

The legal system America fucked. sounds like common sense alien language. 

I find even disgusting I’m heavily downvoted pointing poorly people treated. may pair Karens, broke laws. asked able call whoever babysit hypothetical situation, rightfully happens like mentioned above. 

This sub bizarre, small group users want covid doomsday scenario let states police powers citizens. people also hate trump thing. People praising legal system absolutely ashamed Meh it’s like physically abused parents anything. aunts uncles want understand. They’re bit nutty that’s family. got bit drunk talked politics. far I'm aware never done. completely open borders short casual sign roadside enter different state even know it. Many major cities borders states suburbs many people population general metro area live another state. Often happens rivers, like New York, St Louis, Kansas City, always like Chattanooga El Paso. First heard sounds like trolling attention. thanks post know sells masks :p (she seems media savvy) Full face masks! extra large. Limited housing supply enough jobs/industry support significant new construction. fair, way knowing many cases active.

In fact, given bizarre testing strategy, way knowing almost anything it. government considers pair gloves two separate pieces PPE order boost figures, shouldn’t surprise. Came say exactly this. Common sense. Point govt lying Donald administration go far way pro-virus, makes zero sense. I'm wondering coronavirus dirt Joe Biden. holiday least weekend? Australia elections always take place Saturday. amazing. familiar technology. Thanks source! Geez Louise, *any* adults out-manuever malevolent shenanigans? Meanwhile lot people die autumnal pneumonia? Yes that's part strategy. bit deaths early strict lockdown, countries lockdown get deaths later (better health general public although bit people die earlier, health Sweden defined ""being alive"", also personal relationships, happy work life, money, et cetera). overloaded ICUs economy relative fine. compare numbers one year now. Besides far deaths heavy flu seasons 2017-2018, put things perspective, nobody locked then.

Their strategy protect old frail, failed care homes admitted like almost every country. keep strategy going ICUs handling things viable strategy herd immunity. lockdown get fewers deaths now, get open fall also done major damage economy.

You look one year compare approaches. recommend watch prof Giesecke advisor Sweden explain here:

[Why lockdowns wrong policy - Swedish expert Prof. Johan - UK policy lockdown European countries - correct policy protect old frail - eventually lead herd immunity - initial UK response, “180 degree U-turn”, - Imperial College paper “not good” never seen unpublished paper much policy - paper much - models dubious basis public policy - flattening curve due vulnerable dying first much - **The results eventually similar - Covid-19 “mild disease” similar flu, novelty disease scared - actual fatality rate Covid-19 region - least 50% population UK Sweden shown already disease mass antibody testing becomes available fair, situation India really result bad management, population density conditions simply cannot handled. amazing. experience reference lab, hospital, I’m realizing course I’m familiar time consuming tests. Lol, 32k dead, good. It’s feeling like country wants die. thats newengland Research far shown protests significantly contributing large spikes cities protests occurred.

Edit: source: people talk reporting, talk active cases, talk cases. take active cases wait matter bad USA does, good New Zealand. sadly immaterial. They're still part continental United States sealed borders. would supremely simple see another spike someone traveling state person yet asymptomatic spread others another deadly outbreak begins. flu season comes, we’re going shut again. Even southern states cases get much worse due colder, wherein virus easily transmissible top flu. also don’t know people react seasonal flu + COVID19 half population RI state 10 times bigger. bare minimum enough them. people vigilant mask wearing, washing hands, flu season might bad things equal.  think youi referred documentation: Idk, we've *still* got humans unintentionally dying (literal) fires set TL;DR, focus testing.

 “Are kids really getting virus higher rates adults?

Not likely, says Meghan Delaney, chief Division Pathology Lab Medicine Children's National Hospital Washington, D.C.” 50 people killed mass shooting, yawn shrugged part life nothing done prevent it. 1 person dies terrorist attack, want burn world revenge. “There must lot old people voted ...” November many conservative / right-wingers dead Montpelier good Indian place. extra $600 done soon quickly negated fact second stimulus CARES help us still laid underemployed, country worse position virus ever before. getting started, hope anyone got extra money saved gonna need it. jobs either gone scarce. it’s going get real.

Don’t worry, corporations made billions, rich enriched even further. going show real riot is? I’m fucking ready. Wait, mean virus REAL!!? love end story, hiding face hiding face.
You confess racists end story. Yea, vermont like 10% wealthy, 20% middle class getting taking loan still able pay back debt, 70% dollar generals. India's already human sacrifice, live France probably 80% people already wearing masks shops.

In big cities maybe. Paris last weekend, Lyon yesterday... I'd say +90% wearing one stores. small town shop mask required percentage drops spectacularly.

I'm Provence right now, town full English, Dutch, Belgian German tourists. one wearing damn mask (including French locals). really scary think risks contamination. Big big meeting tomorrow FHSAA regarding Florida high school sports. Lots people can’t sleep tonight. No, need anti tank missile head. kill virus people go near safely. mean, area (also Canada) seems 35-55 crowd refuses wear masks.

If anything see teens/young adults wearing masks retired population (which baffling).

I'm probably exception though bars/gyms/restaurants/malls/newly open businesses might well filled 18-30 year olds care sound crazy take sick day sick... working, recovering. work remotely day bed sweating blankets.

You feel bad, pain everywhere... I'd say take 1 2 sick days feel better, spreading colleagues. Remember barbarian invasions brought Rome? Well, already here. need healthy dose fear survive. always enemy.

Dumbass actually one Hiroshima (if take upper estimates). [Keep beating dead covid-denier. seen sort people shop Walmart? mask requirement years ago, imho. article:

Fauci seems get too. He's smart guy. mass protests 3 weeks ago. 100% supported governer. One thing seen discussed much reason CDC forced suggest use March (which important inconsistent policy often cited anti-maskers). 

The majority US production N95s made originally industrial use. Since FDA clearance, hospitals/GPOs legally purchase market. January, director BARDA screaming White House needed get approved medical use FDA emergency use authorization ([his house testimony long worth want context). 

It took administration mid March push EUA place orders major manufacturers. I'd argue direct result delay forcing CDC suggest use industrial supplies bought up. already saw lot countries/distributors selling masks non-healthcare settings countries, administration acted January alarm bells rung, hospitals could legally purchased larger portion industrial n95 supply (and CDC forced admonishing use general public).

In opinion, administration's 2 month delay forced CDC issue notorious early guidance mask usage. administration acted January experts sounding alarm (allowing healthcare systems buy n95 supply earlier), CDC could much consistent mask policy. “What gonna do, infect me?”

Narrator: *They infected him.* mail votes allowed everyone one bitched since southern state stick history. tries hard asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

""I never learn mistakes. makes look weak change behavior means 'learned' something made 'progress'.""  fucking time anyway, illness. stop ? feel like healthcare employees like Lt. Dan right flipping bird middle bigass storm. know am. “Nobody arguing that”. arguing that. never put people virus inside buildings, closed ventilation, people comprised immune systems others well. took weeks finally closed public transit systems. pretty big mistake overshadow.
I going critical state county leaders. enough common sense realize nuances sides lock stance. health issues also economical issues need considered.
Additionally, know frustrated going on. modern c0nserv@tive you. getting data? last week, 5194 deaths, week 4748 deaths three week 3498 deaths according [COVID That's nearly 50% increase 2 weeks. wasn’t this, would right back AZ, TX States now.

Still objectively better NY? talking people coming country. Inter state whole bucket problems. law, hospitals still hook many things arising crisis.

Yes, shortage PPE spread infection due overcrowding among them. crisis care declared many protections lobbying hard right hook.

Not deaths spread COVID19, already lobbying hard right keep electives open costs- even puts patients risk.

While may case hospital systems, universally true, system country closed electives voluntarily ordered so. pushing keep open likely going go business close, pandemic not, without revenue electives bring in. already happened many hospitals rural areas. Like things, one side could foreseen this. Pandemic expects warned years. exactly healthcare ran business.

Ok, ""foresaw it"" lives.

If think bad USA, staff, better staff, better equipment, equipment, PPE, vents, drug, types drugs fool. Government run healthcare systems lot worse shape every hospital warehouse PPE events like rotate materials never expire. 100% reasonable practical.

LOL no. would never use expires. stands hospitals stock enough PPE 2-3 months worth use, perfectly expect many adopt practices like point forward.

Nope, promise one build hanger sized warehouse fill full millions dollars worth PPE expire long use it. didn’t sign this. You’re minority mindset. Yes signed help people pretty much us continue despite risk. said, go healthcare first world country certain standards safety expected.

You did. did, wife did, daughter did. pointed out, pandemics always possibility, always possibility. Healthcare workers getting sick dying part job (pandemic not). dying job reality many professions pilots, fisherman, drivers, police officers, soldiers, etc. Healthcare risky job field, pandemic novel virus. Like said, either accept risk, don't. entirely you; accept risk, also accept liability happens family members. one blame man go day. Obviously think system everything right liable current outcome. think could better system place events experiencing right now.

I say that, said one liable global pandemic killed half million people every country earth. can't try hold hospital administrators liable that. irrational suggest so. irrational expect every hospital build huge warehouse stock years worth PPE, Drugs supplies change every 100 years level pandemic apples oranges. can’t compare shooting people healthcare crisis.

You missed point. said anyone fired breaking PPE protocols pandemic rehired, reimbursed, used shooting example expose flaw logic. something done today necessity invalidate fired previously necessity.

In middle S. Korea's school closure period, 11.8% households tested (r =10,592) contact COVID-19. highest incidence children 0-9 years 18.6% lowest 5.3%.

Still make lot sense.

Abstract

We analyzed reports 59,073 contacts 5,706 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) index patients reported South Korea January 20–March 27, 2020. 10,592 household contacts, 11.8% COVID-19. 48,481 nonhousehold contacts, 1.9% COVID-19. Use personal protective measures social distancing reduces likelihood transmission.
...
From article: detected COVID-19 11.8% household contacts; rates higher contacts children adults. risks largely reflected transmission middle mitigation therefore might characterize transmission dynamics school closure.
...
We also found highest COVID-19 rate (18.6% [95% CI 14.0%–24.0%]) household contacts school-aged children lowest (5.3% [95% CI 1.3%–13.7%]) household contacts children 0–9 years middle school closure. Despite closure schools, children might interacted other, although data support hypothesis guy's gonna get fired. Although governor Oklahoma moron, headline misleading. quote says shocked he’s first governor test positive. might mattered. message consistently “masks work” people might worn them. Instead said “masks nothing” &amp; people refusing listen became thing. consistent replied ... i.e. bigger species live longer (compare elephants mice, example), bigger members species don’t live long (giant dog breeds like third lifespan toy breeds :( ) Actually, douch*nozzle*. goodness. That's virus works.  always come negative! much winning! Ah, meant see would seem way. meant sociopaths send kids fancy ass prep school. cause effect, although fact willing send people's kids danger there's insulated said danger pretty fucked. course first governor catch Covid Kevin Europe US traditionally different ideas care elderly sick embodied quote: “The Scots see death imminent. Canadians see death inevitable. Californians see death optional.” (Note difference might pronounced today: tweets Swedish ICU doctor go process SURVIVE ICU. good spare capacity required organ systems cope long required Covid-19. good condition muscle reserve. Afterwards, tough time rehab awaits, risk infection deterioration. 
  understand many ICU hard time understanding relatives fellow human beings accepted ICU care. reason. benefit it. make it. 
  support work patients, must prolong death death inevitable. medical decision made discussion several experienced ICU doctors patient's responsible doctor outside ICU.

Source (in Swedish): It’s basically fascist conspiracy Trump going purge deep state everyone crosses military.  Alexa, search definition ""cutting nose spite face"" data suggest improvement. last time positivity rate 20% month ago (june 21, 18%). state crippled lack critical testing infrastructure. managed 7000 tests today, 39% positive. source? Though exhalation valves industrial variants may quite protective outward travel non-valve varients. Herd immunity binary thing. Instead something grows time effect R0 first recovery. also grow linearly cases since waitress likely come contact people. Therefor likely get infected earlier likely infect lot people say hermit.

Social distancing + immunity made numbers go immunity grows R0 fallen even keep social distancing level (or likely slack off). greater immunity social distancing measures lift without much risk resurgence. already lifted measures think likely lift most, all, rest August. So...

On one hand, think right New York held model fighting COVID-19. slow respond, result got hit hard. Compliance within NYC New York state uniformly good.

However, New York got hit pretty early on, lot world fully know bad going get. New York Italy got hit approximately time. IIRC, New York Italy shut within couple weeks other.

Part problem New York ran was, apparently first infections came early December, spreading around January February anyone even realized US. time identified, outbreak already full force. ways, New York much opportunity learn anyone, mistakes somewhat understandable.

But rest US impression outbreak New York hoax fluke. think reason New York got hit (they believe) big cities unhealthy filled dirty people live unhealthy lifestyles. still believe people community die this, even though people communities dying this. one states participate waves

Quoting emphasis NYC handled Governors Texas, Georgia, Florida would probably 10x many deaths now.

Love craziest fucking shit without sources upvoted here. 350,000 people dying single state sounds realistic you?

And isn’t true, Chicago, LA,Boston dense areas handled much better NYC did. Hell even fucking Miami sub hates daily may end significantly better death rate New York. sub got stop circlejerking Cuomo. know shortage trying purchase word may getting around... r/Leopardsatemyface means learn mistakes. something bad happens, think happened why, could done prevent it. Ugh. scarier thing catching likely nothing *him* wearing mask, idiots wearing masks spreading it. case youre troll I’ll point day day comparisons good way track progress. It’s best track day week day previous weeks (Saturdays Saturdays, Wednesdays Wednesdays, etc) states counties different reporting patterns throughout week mostly kept weekly patterns (though holiday weeks throw things couple days). whole states counties within states dont report weekends, many county labs dont process swabs Sundays, post entire weekend numbers Mondays, on. would also disingenuous say typical Monday Tuesday increase sign massive rise. Supposedly Q many others believe money going disappear slowly worked system worldwide implanted tiny microchip health data use able buy things. log vaccinated already virus able enter places, grocery stores, department stores, doctors offices etc etc. Pretty sci-fi tell lol died 2 airplane crashes, might noticed. always wanted visit NYC, seeing downturn lately, see heading direction. Almost like modern day hitler.. assholes one things trying emphasize 50+ ""reopen"" people. Younger people missed 3-6 months bar life, 4 months school, graduation, internships, starting jobs, socializing. screaming saving economy flouting mask orders going burn willingness sacrifice older generations. last lockdown ruined olds, burnt younger peoples goodwill proccess. hate never really know anxiety covid unless suddenly become horribly ill get tested, live paranoia hope precautions taking gonna cut administration pulls together herd immunity completed. LMAO, literally gave link deaths linked nursing homes state percentage deaths, meaning point half-truth. really need open schools tho. Pikachu face Go back cave, troglodyte! Yeah that's definitely factor Fauci completely corrupted demagoguery ideology.  let guess, shot behind. would means admitting Dr. Fauci correct, know would never accept that. So, *hours* typical. someone lab needs test, extracted loaded machine 30 minutes, including time takes incubate. PCR takes 1 hour 14 minutes ABIs, resulting takes 30s/sample. Sometimes see positive result 35-45 minutes, negatives always take full 74 minutes.

Most tests finished 8 hours, time waiting extraction accessioning. Takes hour notify providers that.  Nope, normal American enjoying life. try it. Muh freeeduumb see ankle tagging worse police come house check and/or thrown jail.

It looks like use COVID Tracking testing counts. I'm sure deaths disagree. Phlebotomists cheaper labor nurses.. CBD mouthwash gonna hard find soon.

I mean seriously. fuck. competition, NJ actually hardest hit state, per capita. also densely populated state, good comparison lot states. Basically, NJ see spread, even social distancing state is. reason state higher rate transmission NJ simply state issue NJ.  Family grifters total shield strategy vulnerable would sensible approach day one: lockdown vulnerable (if give consent course) giving resources need (plus money buying phones/computers they're always touch loved ones). 

With lockdowns-for-all, healthy people extremely low risk dying draining vital resources (delivery shopping supermarkets example) need most. Well yes, listening trump, doubt? ""Lyin' Ted"" -- who's liar? ""Crooked Hillary"" -- who's crooked one?  Replace Obamacare something better cheaper. it? (never intention. 

When first started running, said would release tax returns became 'the presumptive candidate'. happened, said would release elected. One lie top another. 

I sometimes see people two categories -- constructive destroyers. trump destroyer.)

ps. also need vodka. : ) Eh, virus deadly enough demographics republican politicians inevitable enough catch it. Italy locked March 9, NY March 22. That’s difference less 2 weeks. contrast, states going shit 3+ months later. Also, whole world still scrambling figure disease back March, whereas seems like enough time learn lot since then. asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

Lolll Sure! It’s random weird, sure make it. ya go:  Appreciate man, best luck y'all well! AZ times, different kind pretty I'm used to, I'm hoping reason comes across board sooner rather later. don’t know you’ve noticed, hospitals literally running places put patients many. Covid proven *not* “any illness”  Lmao. future kids DEPENDS health teachers Yup. Love em hate em Bush, Obama, Clinton would handled things 10x better. perfectly (especially them) would national guidelines *at least* late April/early May sooner. would federal government purchasing PPE March outbidding one another.  TIL: No. vents risk free, really choice. time someone needs ventilator, going hypoxic respiratory failure. Without one die. It’s either intubate ventilate patient tell family say goodbye. I’m doctor Covid patients. time Covid case becomes severe, 80% die matter do, 100% die without ventilator. 

Now things improved somewhat; tried new therapies reduce need *some* ventilators prevent everyone, proning, better treatments like earlier steroid bursts remdesivir, improved hi-flow O2 facilities didn’t previously. doesn’t end need ventilators people need regardless.  170 people whole lot chance kings spread. that’s missing ~~political overcome current bureaucratic inertia.~~ right people getting paid. 

Fixed you. user says , already know [There’s evidence shared immunity among corona general. People one common cold corona virus' recently immune cells reactive Covid-19.

It’s unlikely isn’t shared immunity among various strains Covid 19. sub get carried away. two distinct issues one lying data, think clear evidence Trump bypassing CDC hospitals report straight HHS, trying withhold testing contact tracing next bill, straight saying slow testing saying I'm kidding.

The piece false narratives continue spun data published. cases go immediately upon reopening, go up, hospitalizations going up, go up, deaths going up. lag observed time time frankly obvious anyone thinks logically sequence events. Obfuscating death count combining NY/NJ dwarfed everything current hotspots still early rise naive best. people post bs folks get tired explaining it. I'd rather say, fuck yeah was. Dear sir madam, recently notified Governor proud state Oklahoma compared cuntsuckingturdbuckets. Well know cuntsuckingturdbuckets offended compared us. would say turdsuckingcuntbucket. That's literally works. tiny tiny bit research. people forced work gyms snowflake ass needs go workout end getting sick? isn’t you. greater good. Exactly. Look Ronnie done/doing Florida. think so. ravaged New York got it. New York could learned that, didn't... New Yorkers, unironically, cannot understand others learning went through.

Italy went lockdown March 9, NY State went lockdown March 22. dates oversimplified partial lockdowns then, 2 weeks Italian lockdown New York lockdown.

It crazy ""NY use two weeks perfectly, one surprised Texans fighting mask orders July."" toddler preschooler much better identifying patterns things would thought them. especially good visual patterns require bit ""out box"" thinking. seem trouble longer length patterns ideas surrounding shorter patterns puzzles I'd expected pre-child. really insult compare adult acts like child emotionally/logically without unrestricted type thought.

Inaccurate way information obtained. put facebook ad asking people come drive testing site. majority people showed middle class, middle aged, white women.

Politics control today, permeates media constantly trying pull us different directions. THIS. infuriates me. couple million dead Americans tens millions permanently damaged debilitated. That's ends. Also Provence. Nobody wear masks here. see lot conspiracy propaganda saying masks good immune systems. Considering France also top 1 antivaxx country, I'm surprised all. really hope people going take seriously, stop believing Raoult's hydroxychloroquine going magically save them.  colder is, introspective people are. e.g. England vs Scotland, stuck lot winter thoughts. Norway supposed incredible yet.

Southern Europe South America full passionate hotheads. 

Not based anything except extremely crude stereotypes though course. insane. They're opening everything, telling everyone exercise caution. Spoiler alert: going work. simply wrong:

- Deaths COVID 19 5 months: **142,000**

And deaths flu take break there's another virus town. don’t really get, Dr. Birx spearheaded data collection change. world class infectious disease expert protege Dr Fauci, still get along speak regularly.

Whenever you’re essential worker (as young people are) you’ve thrown whole time work bar resteraunt lot us tend understand mindset “fuck it, I’m risking life old folks time, they’re taking away ability go school/college socialising time life it’s important, fuck I’m gonna go party” I’m saying agree understand mindset. going take anyone step here? going sit back watch POS completely run country ground? still live upstate too. I'm claiming everyone westchester stupid. hand think ignorance bullshit deal growing 20+ years small redneck town earns right call backwards fuckers stupid. treated really poorly kid/YA majority whole TOWN, willful ignorance outdated views. (Not even getting CURRENT views race politics Corona. restricted one small town. family upstate see everywhere rural)

So clarify admit generalizing 10 million people stupid. opinion, some/many rural people upstate stupid and/or willfully ignorant. experience still day, mean true.

Edit: inconsistency live vs family family (parents, Gparents, aunts/uncles, cousins, siblings, plus laws, live rural upstate Ulster Delaware ADKS. moved one liberal cities refer to. However still see family frequently interact people rural areas. Objectively better NY, though say they've done best. Gonna get cha! Line vaccine/chip! don’t go Disney one last hurrah.

I want state disappointed whole country taking seriously making something functionally solved many countries (S Korea, Italy(!), UK) literally worst place since quarantine orders started.

I can't believe people insanely ignorant thick headed putting thousands people's lives danger still give shit. really upsetting selfish people been. Absolutely. first time asked stay home stomach didn’t feel good, mom said okay sat asked questions school going friends treating me. Everything fine respect, I’m glad immediately identified could issue. Turns bad stomach problems worsened years became frequent problem. mom still asked questions periodically make sure something else contributing. I’m thankful that, especially I’m older understand more. White House say language bill? Isn’t point separation powers? problem Italy New York ravaged time...the virus already widely circulating New York time shutdown came, one knew lack testing. Everything came afterwards due delayed shutdown. everything closed down, else could New Yorkers done? viral photos things like dumb New Yorkers crowding see hospital ship come in, saw, streets empty non-essential workers stayed home. Okay seeing LOT people mentioning data collected shared public manipulated much positive tests negative. someone tell would manipulated? government want lower numbers country could officially reopen? higher numbers anyone..... would shit brick months ago. Remember everyone shocked almost amount people died 9/11 died?! weekly occurrence. Wtf  source backdating deaths lag, bs Georgia pulls backdating data always looks like cases falling. Also Northeast really bad recovered, focus current hotspots going up. I'll give benefit doubt downvotes people think intentionally dense things discussed ad nauseam. sad. one brave ones. cousin immediate family got Florida. Parents hospital now.  start wearing mask stop protesting masks Yes, seems like every time go drive-thru, young person window. wearing gloves masks now. facemask protect you, protect others you.... I'm amazed NY succeeded. saw subway trains crammed unmasked people. first wave pandemic? RemindMe! 10 months fucking universe New York model *what do* model *what do*? no. skipped /s important thing ignore rather try reason them. reason arguing makes believe theory even harder gives attention want.

It’s easier change supply chains public opinion. Better run masks populace doesn’t believe masks work.

It makes difficult us say ‘trust science’ ‘the science’ vehemently calling mask-wearers paranoid months ago. Wearing mask protect anyway. Others interacts closely wear protect him. - idiots How? New York New Jersey 1,700 deaths per 1 million population. rest country 400 / million dolts far Trumps bunghole.

Surprised didn’t chug bleach. You’re wrong all. I’m young definitely see people age taking mindset “fuck you, it’s problem” many others aren’t taking seriously. Everybody know took seriously beginning yet older crowd thought wasn’t serious hoax. younger group saying “fuck guys, don’t high chance dying this.” Quite frankly don’t blame lot making decision, it’s uninformed it’s hard feel robbed thing could’ve easily dealt taken seriously. didn’t take seriously younger people aren’t badly affected (statistically speaking) they’re going live lives now. Shocking concept /s Close bars young people house parties. least bar guidelines enforced insure people don’t mix parties, remain seated, stay 2M apart parties on. house parties 0 rules. Anything goes destroying country reason. simply saving people costs money trump doesnt like spending money things doesnt care about. Hes destroying poor people lives order force everyone work, stock market well stay power. hes concerned bunch average citizens dying, doesnt affect way manpower problem coordinated all. hospitals advance warning. New systems need extensive training people using them. meeting meeting soliciting feedback people would using system - inclusion good also people suing system *valuable input* offer. 

This disaster. Typical WH attitude disrespecting working people contributions. Workers filler machines it. guess make go away much faster. something see villain would movie/cartoon. Unfortunately Americans, happens real life. fuck reality denying moron. 32k dead NY 5k FL still want say NY better job. Idiot. hey! half family lives there! calms knowing they're good job That's really problem it?

""My freedom"" collective, ""mine"" right absolutely nails whole fuckfest self-destructive narcissism. yikes. forgot sub ccp moderated month drastically increasing 'reported cases' deaths pretty much noisy flat trend. South Africa month winter new Covid cases increased five fold last two months. don’t get control early fall real trouble. Yep, cloth masks surgical masks stop droplets, don’t stop aerosols. need N95 that. 

I would much rather prefer every person N95 wear, especially closed room people. masks aren’t effective, still go long way stop large droplets. That’s huge places like grocery stores essential shopping people come *and* touch surfaces. drama. many spy movies. crazier theory, believe Intentional harm Fair point.

They acknowledge explicitly account limitations promise update ""quality life comorbidity adjusted YLLs"" September. numbers similar neighboring countries. 

They already trace track citizens countries, increased oversight due disease makes perfect sense. means know clusters almost immediately inputted system. 

Their citizens willingly self isolate encouraged police help organize deliver food doorstep (along army delivery people). 

Masks handed like candy they're actually used. turns actually vital piece protection, good thing wearing since discovery outbreak.

Health officials charge health policy, politicians. 

This everything US doing.

I'm sure someone protect you. Thank We'd make conspiracy. Reverse psychology dumb fuckers Nobody parrots that. information factual young people almost time absolutely fine. long lasting damage that’s also likely small percentage time time. small percentage young people die it. 

Now mean go get deliberately parties concerts? Absolutely not. INDIVIDUAL risk barely worth thinking about. I’m 20, couldn’t give shit get Covid. obviously don’t want pass onto anyone else. there’s point lying young people disease affecting them. really need law enforcement come harder people parties. locked two fucking months idiot. stop it. place stopping lockdowns. sure? singular virus aware wide infected rate is, widespread factor favoring mutation. Mutations happen, state, non-producytive. also mutate virulent different. different enough treatments work well, vaccines effective, preventative measures adequate, survive better. environmental pressures cellular level virus societal level us. dont think that's accurate. cant see redcaps supporting Obama too. frightening infuriating. whole goal understand something works.

Edit: specifically, meant like people want argue point lol charts,Georgia cases certainly spiking deaths lagging. probably Florida weeks ago. monocle may fallen upon floor excitement, fine sir. believe yours. threat long-term damage still seems unclear.

This study claiming almost 1600 mild covid infections studied resulted permanant damage, delves case someone seems extremely severe symptoms. “mild case”?? confident claiming tje bodys infected never recover long live?? 

I’ve read sources claiming covid-positive patients never experienced symptoms may sustained life-long damage arteries organs. 

If really true, isn’t trumpeted across world?? isn’t media US publishing articles even never experienced covid symptoms, body could shredded hell without even noticing???? virus taking years millions Americans lives feel fine??? 

For months seemed like virus extremely damgerous elderly anyone unhealthy, comfort reports vast majority patients recover.

But don’t recover? almost pretty much disabled entirety lives? could healthcare professional ever claimed people recover?

They changed tune months, turned that, big surprise, masks help. caused huge problem. know people ""recommendations"" ignorant/incompetent, lying us. 

Either way, trust people now?  empathy!
Also failing! :( yet thread money, virus response.

That point. think that's good summary current state conditions. interesting question whether resgurgence hit Northern states next, fast accelerate? Another key question extent surge driven re-opening businesses/factory plants versus re-socializing &amp; mixing among friends/relatives/neighbors? problem affecting many nations South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, India, Russia UK. Yes! I’m divorce everyone dog. box turtle one gets days we’ve also three decades together. counties around country we're longer epidemic levels heath distress seasonal averages death etc.

That's promising news. many countrymen imagine accept vaccine? amount anti-vax people surely dampen effort. works motivation key. Unfortunately, lot people (kids adults) lack motivation.

Isn't ""motivation"" individual pretty much established early age?  test--the marshmallow test, think called it--that could foretell child's future educational/life success?

And, recently book called GRIT, supposed tell instill...well...grit or, take it, instill something child make better student.

Not teacher, obviously, high school, seems, whatever needed sucess adult is--or be--already established. 

Self-motivation needed online education might necessary younger students maybe high schoolers? seriously need conversation what’s gonna happen people refuse get vaccine. might well start conversation now, opposed it’s emergency.  Stop telling people words use *you* shitty understanding it. Anti-science means science, trusting science. 

Also you’re clearly scientist scientist would say science “fact period”. It’s theories supporting evidence time argued evidence. always challenge science, that’s new things discovered. science needs challenged science. accepted science “fact period” we’d still think Earth center universe. 

Everyone else knew meant said anti-science, except you. I’m talking people blatantly ignore science convenient them. leaked cdc guidelines school reopening online classes older students, younger students could take advantage extra class space spread out.  Thank Genoa Italy 😊🇮🇹 hope ok, wherever live  Sad true Fewer deaths per million. Higher level ignorance let's kid ourselves. want hear population density excuses. chance take faster action follow China's strategy way US followed Italy China's strategies.  Sounds like havent looked this. Clear definition Australia essential workers ANYONE 70. personal stand point correct, financial stand point wrong. average world citizen lost faith US true. global markets hand play big role currency valuations tremendous faith US. noticed US markets crashed burned? 

Right, keep printing money keep afloat. go even bananas feds start buying stock addition buying corporate bonds, handing 2 million cash businesses, questions asked, answers works US, that's like Communism works even stretch.

I realize oversimplifying things president actually ordering money printed (I hope. cannot say would surprised though.

With tax cuts seen, reduction tax revenue businesses, trillions dollars coming government handing PPP handouts, corporate bond buying, stimulus cash, PUA kicker, soon straight buy stock keep prices up? Yeah, read comments left tweet news story. Brain damage enough justification nonsense believe. I'll take chances virus, thanks hyperbole though. essentially got us Vietnam? Seeing live images TV greatly reduced support? mistaking something else? Body bags coming airplanes? know saw images Italy ICUs people hallways without beds, people beds hooked ventilators, really disturbed me. never saw make TV though... sign up? website says started recruiting yet. Editor Lancet (the journal results get published) tweeted ""Tomorrow. Vaccines. saying""

Fingers crossed Can’t wait hear needlessly expensive it’s going United States don’t wanna make loved ones cry. say it’s going bad currently there’s enough testing there’s enough contact tracing people aren’t taking seriously federal government decided try wish away, it’s hard imagine opening schools turn great I've thinking recently position dollar world's reserve currency greater threat ever been. Well... happened?? side effects scary. partaking vaccine. Maybe learn read. asked reply someone prove claim, Trump said false. ONE DID. you, anyone. said something reply, doesnt make magically true. isnt liberal competition, participants win prize entering. 

JFC. teach simple reading comprehension schools anymore? inevitably happens, single headline, rather series milestones. counter, Texas much smaller population density “Effectively” 
like guarantee gets job done. anyone seen additional articles this? I’m looking information children infected. infected adults coming home people taking babies immune systems Walmart hoping best? former high school teacher, COMPLETELY agree this. I've students sit class absolutely NOTHING. I've multiple meetings parents, students, etc. etc. etc. change. students fail quite nicely own. It’s science-based thinking, actually. I'm saying majority divorces caused even significant amount, calm get high horse. I've personally witnessed quite people go seemingly normal walls crazy conspiracy theorists last couple months, can't tell spouses dealing that.

&amp;#x200B;

Also talking people different political views. I'm talking cruel nasty people yelling minimum wage workers ask wear masks, call people wearing masks literal nazis, sharing stuff easily disproved little bit research etc. There's huge difference changing political view suddenly revealing horrible person. Sounds like they’re rushing it. Everyone said would take year half IIRC shot + booster get best results, means 400 million doses = 200 million vaccinated. level coordination numbers timeframe suggest...you must United States.  Lol wow, 100 wave? wave wtf 70k cases per day I’ve waited 21 days counting CVS result. Rather moot point.

I work home, really hope people can’t situation. terrible ignorance knowing business owners constitutional rights. goons claim opposite firm belief intention reading cherished document. real world stupidity triumph. can't walk onto someone's property whatever hell want. Right? here's reality, do, cops afraid them. Yeah, ""children can‘t infected / won‘t pass around""-trope aged like milk Arizona sun post way political, that’s way spun it.

It political. Mass Mind society addicted badness. ""I love kids, I'm anti-vaccination, anti-mask, deny climate change!""

Been seeing often. wish people would learn others mistakes, many people attitude ""it happen me"" multiple studies say opposite. one saying this. Figures one gets People finally starting realize much school really day care many families. 

If teacher, would 100% quit going back normal school fall. step foot classroom kids without good vaccine Covid numbers dropping significantly. 


For school opens normally, kids going spread virus place. Every single teacher exposed. mention kids parents family member live with.

You can't control kids. wear masks properly stay away other. physically possible them. 

I feel bad teachers forced choose contracting deadly disease jobs, would rather broke dead. 

And honestly think schools open shut insanely quick. virus infect people crazy fast forced shut down. Lol even realise downvoted till now. Thanks support!  watch baseball watch game. statement false. Umm, still exist. don’t really believe either! children tend asymptomatic doesn’t mean spread virus less. seems like people less inclined test children don’t appear sick they’re super spreaders? amount times see people kids adults wearing face masks children &amp; babies left unmasked crazy me.

ETA: someone made point masks dangerous children 2. Completely makes sense. wonder done protect children age bracket public crowded spaces. decision based totally trump cuckhold wanting seem like good compliant boy. 
Go ahead ban comment. Truth hurts. 249 number yesterday abnormally low. past week definitely improved. reason wild fluctuations percent positive? mean tests given? many stores, masked there's plenty people wearing masks.

Massive shrinkflation headed costs higher learning. Much less costs would bad enough, sounds like worse product *and* increased cost.

The death higher education country bad everyone except politicians corporations. Speaking global perspective think world pretty normal start 2022. end year think least 1 vaccine approved production advanced vaccines already started. 

But entirely depends vaccine approved. Eg Oxford vaccine works, it'll likely approved October countries like UK back normal weeks. countries may wait get doses. competent one too. current ""strategy"" plugging ears, closing eyes, singing ""lalalala"" can't hear anything.

Everyone so. 

Some politicians understand science caved mass fear lockdown people months politicians understand science caved complacency opened everything.

There's always middle ground found paranoia recklessness. lot parents expected work full time kids home, challenging especially younger kids constantly monitored. know preschooler would happier preschool right now, could play children participate activities led teachers aren’t trying simultaneously attend Zoom meeting bosses. It’s normal kids want get house play kids. getting bored rowdy, parents expected work 9 5 time.   google Missouri remember city it. know way thought.

Toronto Public Health admitted try hard (Long Island, NY) get much push back. equally get many complaints customers customers adhering mask mandate. wish they’d shut us again, bc feel like I’m risk bc people don’t care health safety. want partying.  combined percentage seems largely depend many negative tests add mix (doesn't seem much rhyme reason - matter try numbers add up). 

The *real* numbers seem 15 20 percent rather consistently overall percentage 15 percent range - changed. I’m psychologist works middle junior high schools. already assumed case, gives chills think passing time, 700 students packed halls like sardines. Right now, we’re talking two elements, dividing kids two groups. Even that, school small, continue kids ending close us staff. I’m ready worried. reading fine print Florida university said course forced online would HIGHER cost ""technology overhead"" required.

And residential (dorm) fees due July 16th, move date set, make gaurantee date set, fees refundable 16th bars nightclubs open there? Sounds similar things Ireland though delayed reopening pubs next month know type bet viral video trend kids licking hands running eachother playing COVID tag. Lots people things wrong don’t lower standard them. Kilts even breathable. bull again.

The headline read; ""Ultra-sensitive diagnostic test detects non-infectious viral debris Israeli doctor recovered month, came contact confirmed patient subsequently tested positive virus.

The article say whether doctor symptoms (i.e. disease) result ""reinfection,"" guess safely assume doctor not. likely viral debris doctor's first infection -- or, worst, reinfection Cells first infection quickly destroying virus (i.e. immunity). Seriously? point fuck would go restaurant? could catch person you’re eating with. Yes, even OUTSIDE! Capitalism isn’t healthy. Every increase output warming planet. Capitalism needs grow keep working cost planet. AWWWW, funny enough? Insert celebrity gif floss. 100%. could SP EASILY come hero. many friends mine anti-Trudeau changed stance handled Covid well.

Everybody gets want. try buy beer ask take mask ID you. said asymptomatic carriers contagious Oh gosh. stupid. Everyone knows kids can’t spread germs.....

Lol seriously cannot believe even topic needed discussion... would likely end anything reassembling democracy country. God hope not. chance apply LAUSD instead? often ""no show""/retirements end even normal summers would need fill roles. They're separate. Brands always cross country borders, depending agreements. Kmart Australia spin-off went independent licensed, bought, Kmart name use Australia. 

It's like 7 US made Keurig Dr Pepper, bottled PepsiCo elsewhere. articles aren’t posted. articles posted since day-one provide great clickbait doomers subs like this, increasing clicks. 

Since day one, people claiming reinfections. Since day one, claims disproven something else. Guess I'll make new ones kids. still filter though. Fine, site study says immunity likely long lived instead complaining studies articles indicate contrary. Yeah starting get busy here. Agree. also huge, fast moving paradigm shift lot people's livelihoods going feel, be, threatened. probably fair say varied lot normal never across society. could support everyone economically gets sorted. Fat chance. ""Two weeks!""  confirmation bias anti-science pay attention this. Actually, anti-science ignore possibility re-infection, literally way know yet: take months years data collection answers. inclination dismiss potential constant re-occurring infection hand, incomplete data, reckless dangerous. surely lead risky behavior people believe, due confirmation bias, immune, could lead nasty shock in, say 18 months.  Imagine nobody getting help donate penny relief fund sit pasty ass criticizing others actually helping need. Kindergarten teacher here... terrifying, probable US too.. Say what? post counter anything I've said thus far? We're ready seeing evidence reinfection. 2 3 months, stories become commonplace, accepted facet virus. sure confusing you, anyway, good day, suppose.  Reopening process dozens smaller steps weeks months. It’s nothing. That’s silly. 

NYC “locked down” number people inside restaurant regulated. European countries required self-declaration forms people left apartments. Americans never ""lockdowns,"" private gatherings tolerated.

Since Vit fat-soluble, builds system cause health problems excess, hurt. Here's good article talks safe dosages watch case toxicity: I'm going go #1 reason job/income. Followed closely 1.A pay rent/mortgage 1.B provide food. almost Maslow's pyramid thing. ""American Nightmare"" current. Vietnam closed right quick. Canadian talking friends back home, care believe would go there. Closed quick friends thought overreacting. Try looking stats Texas start pandemic, ""excess deaths"" pneumonia deaths. every reason believe Texas undercounted Covid deaths governor local politicians wanted downplay pandemic keep businesses open. Never worked begin with, belief, adding step simply need already make good logical guess happen. Know body works, develop vaccine react specific way body.

Peoples bodies maybe react differently, whole concept called placebo ridiculous, persons body maybe ever slightly different, however mean chock called 'placebo'. Maybe someones body something certain way compared others.

Oh placebo worked, see getting better.? No, body already inclined first place! Ie maybe fared little better virus perhaps body maybe little different compared others. maybe worse others simply reasons. whole concept placebo simply unrealistic.

Develop something, actually know bodies work react thus know develop something absolutely work.

Simply need SEE anything! already good idea happen! ~7000 active cases. infections occurred last 30 days. thought mask meant protect protect others. headline suggest differently? mayors Arkansas trying find ways handle situation Governor’s guidelines. It’s recently statewide mask mandate initiated, effective Monday. think also likely something expression ACE2 much lower grade school middle school crowd junior high high school. We're probably going end several factors physical development account overall lower children. None say can't deadly, debilitating, severe adults, may play overall less likely.

Almost every long hauler extreme mental fatigue. Early on, Trump saying wanted let virus rip get with. Fauci said good conscience recommend letting X percent population die.

It's good thing Trump charge, discrediting Fauci, conscience. 100% political Ahh conservatives... Every single day check r/coronavirus. every single day see headline makes say “what actual fuck?!” loud. exhausting. tests take hours

This universal, PCR tests covid-19 (and influenzas) take 30 minutes. Mesa Biotech one recently got EUA heard 8 minutes; suppose probably antibody tests blood draw blood poke quick dirty material cleanup. Early nobody plan New York got hit first. New York’s plan since far away best plan, it’s even close. learn done instead stubborn, like seem doing. look recent cases, totally flat lined. **Doctor survived COVID-19, bewildered public disregard.** go telling nothing. 

Go get find better nothings win win win bigly dems  Really hard understand basic numbers. 32000 vs 7300. who’s better?? vanishingly rare

I think know yet. Antibodies drop time goes on. may able get long-lasting immunity.  Yes, states learned NY. They've learned do.

But death rate lower April. duh deaths ""spiking""... total number cases climing. Americans idea good it. Ben Jerry Well. someone get sick and/or die, certainly group invites it. Son born 8 weeks premature May. let one parent time, masks mandatory, hand washing mandatory, took temp able even enter hospital. fucking hilarious how, deaths rising, trolls comments r/lockdown_skepiticism moved ""fatalities tho"" ""look yesterday, we've flattened curve like Sweden, time party everybody!""

Google evidence social distancing stop COVID 19. read plethora links yourself. 2 CDC crowds social day chief NYC Police Benevolent Society filmed Fox Q-Anon mug. I'm sorry going this. really puts perspective even though demographic extremely low death rate, virus must taken seriously matter life-altering consequences.

If mind asking, M.E. stand for? probably missed something. mentioned extreme mental fatigue, long term effect Covid well? tested antibodies in-between infections?

I'm saying believe you, curious. Either that, vaccine may possible enough time. Work math little carefully!

Loss immunity starting around 3 months would consistent around 25 cases re-infection US. months loss immunity short term ruled statistically (though would personally bet loss immunity &lt; 1y timescale ends rare unlikely).

But absolutely statistical case reports reinfection dismissed hand anomalous. true (yet). germany horrendous job tho Pelosi right wants I'm going use on. Ty. Also lifelong incomes book deals/Fox news commentator jobs Today lower yesterday lot. 75 63, all. Either day one downward trend (due manipulated data Saturday lull past Saturdays lull, Sundays Mondays have), keep seeing expected rise. 

Yes, highest Saturday record yes, things continue according accurate reporting CDC last week, expect previously upward trend keep going up.

I concerned fraudulent data. 

I concerned white house manipulate data make today day 1 ongoing downward slope new cases tomorrow fewer, Monday fewer, Tuesday fewer still.

So either people stupid think 63 lower 75, lot people side look forward data manipulation political reasons. actually read study? tested patients felt sick - children aged 10-19 tested symptoms rare. Look breakdown brought COVID families - 57/10,592 age 0-9 (.005%) 231 age 10-19 supports real world data we've seen thus far (e.g., Sweden) children rarely symptoms thus, rarely transmit.  think scariest part outspoken folks higher degree clout contracting virus somehow still enough get people come around.

Like many people guy convince need precautions, it, many people swing back? 

Perhaps worse still - gets mild case doubles ""It's big deal"" rhetoric? union demand need enhanced training protecting citizens rights. “Stupid man doesn’t understand caught Covid-19 stupid” Yes check th charts, exponential trend emerging. thing is, even stop now, it'll keep growing month. like happened Italy. We're already going see major issues. I'm praying newest treatments help curb some. really good ones called revolutions.  Airport workers, flight attendants state workers needs leave country business volunteer shot well. lens hindsight lens lookig through, put shoes start pandemic, almost noone (politically) really taking COVID-19 much issue really was. watched, yes, considered real potential risk public wellbeing whole state, no. Why, then, would shut entire state it? makes sense moment. information came light regarding COVID-19's severity, like white rice. listened medical scientific communities, implemented plan would minimize loss life injury due COVID-19. began daily briefings ended becoming familiar voice many household, speaking clearly concisely going on, plan was, new information regarding disease. fairly clearly tell actually listen briefings, explains alot many others talked about, even agreeing that, hindsight, shut everything down, given context situation time, would he? time seemed like something relatively contained NYC severe. Hate rational response that, it? would like someone blaming firefighter putting house fire signs fire.  live Spain (pretty much worst death rate, strictest lockdown hardest economic hit Europe) also tons guys like this, tell government everything right either inevitable someone else's fault. crazy. like mix Stockholm syndrome severe acalculia. Like Trump going reelected people see useless crisis like pandemic. fit lead. helping virus spread impatient. actually productive amazing job stopping spread could lf chance reelected... ego ignorance got way selfish.

Tremendous. /s  Thank you. too, friend! title perfect clearly target wording. many people read headlines days, many loudly proclaim themself ""patriots"" act pandemic issue. pandemic destroying American dream - Trump sits showing beans. put together, wait. Tragic people continue die do. Well NY State give coworker dressing-down last year came work coughing sneezing place. Admitted son sick *2 weeks* thought caught whatever had. lunch asked planned going doctor, said “oh couldn’t get tomorrow.” Gave evil eye started loudly obnoxiously decontaminating desk went home. 

He ended needing pretty strong antibiotics took next week off. Don’t know felt need go day; possibly generous sick leave policy ever. also come holidays “what else supposed MLK day?” (Maybe spend young children? boss gave talk found out) Denial. everywhere man. Source sending patients NM? think telling truth. Karen probably. voting actually made difference, would made illegal years ago.  illusion choice powerful. name Kevin's Tit? Seriously? fact protests outside definitely helped. might already know, businesses located inside. 

Beyond that...are joking? Plenty places require masks *certain* groups people huge fucking problem wearing one. Video tonight Nashville, testing backlog sadly. There's limit number concurrent tests run one time :(

I hope friend tests negative! ""It never goes hundreds, yet also never goes zero""

I mean yeah laugh lie. easy anyone check.  Seek help. Well, that's thing. traditional method develop vaccine rocket science.

The key mass production safety testing, country less concern litigation lawsuits, easily fast-trac clinic trials. Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, DC massive protests seeing kinds spikes AZ, CA, FL, GA, etc. experiencing.

Protesting 100% safe experience, sure. Also SoCal counties largest spikes large scale protests LA like Riverside OC. mean even California still less cases twice population. mean 140,000 people dead. 3 million people infected. even, like, scale WW2 plague... 


/s needing it. trending trending up. First: says ""did it"" past tense. 

Second: told people wear masks early on. contributed disastrous spread, anti-mask sentiment. Well, wrong. said either yesterday Thursday US would hit 140k deaths Monday. surpassed 140,116 Saturday even yet. Oof Same. Rarely drink, sounds good, gimme. Probably day after. “I pretty shocked **the first** governor get it,” burns 20% progressed virus already saturated community followed course going take without measures. Condoms queers sailors.  Omegalul They'd get fired replaced within week. Uh, Ya know counterproductive testing going make pandemic last longer... want end point please actually productive help stop spread... Please... Please... I'm sick nonsense idiots wearing masks people government allowing virus spread more... scary... I'm actually scared ""FBI Surveillance Van"" feverishly looking you. send old people back nursing homes killing old people? Lmao, basically Uhh people want us believe cure COVID-19, dire worldwide pandemic seen century, would make vaccine priceless, yet sell stock like this? 

Why wait they're US company patent vaccine COVID-19 approved US use? printing money vaccine, raking financial support/incentives form government, licensing patent internationally, stock price rise accordingly, making stock options worth much time next year. 

If vaccine works. 

If vaccine work, become multimillionaires announcing going human trials getting go-ahead trump government (who even mandate masks indoors) skip many steps between. 

Chew get back me. people verified pre-existing condition, mean pre-existing condition... NP, look incremental case deaths reported day (vs backdated) here. cases flat decreasing think getting better treating them. Cases starting rising mid June, mid July expect see earliest signs deaths. death trend obfuscated bit national level data since increase started, filtering hotspots like AZ, TX, FL make clear. also filter NY see much influenced national curve controlled much decrease peak. Mm motherfucking hmmm 

Dumbest idea ever. fire... burned me. touched it, burned me. 

What meaning this!? Executing people good method get rid covid lol live Enid, north OKC. residents voted mask mandate. people think covid nothing hoax get Trump office. [lasted states direction. time need expected. wrong last 1 week. Cuomo's order last May 10th, returned 4000 people needlessly nursing homes ample hospital space available. result something like 12000+ nursing home deaths.

New Orleans / Louisiana similar outbreak time scale result deaths like NY exact opposite order banning sending COVID patients nursing homes 30 days. Today leaned something! wasted valuable swabs photo Honestly feels like already lost election... feels like we've already cheated level true representation. Regardless wins loss. know. wear one 9 hours day need go stuff.

Sometimes hotter would like completely comfortable, hardly torture device anti-maskers seem portray as. Senate Republicans debating Trump administration officials. insane people fighting even insaner people.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah forgot sending back old people, COVID positive, retirement homes hospital textbook pandemic protocol. 

Really groundbreaking stuff. went Safeway yesterday first time while. They're one set doors entrance one exit. employees entrance. employee the, locked, exit door pressing button let people out. guess wanted make sure people wearing masks left store? Perhaps already recovered covid-19 longer contagious. kidding, probably idiots exposed virus. Data recent weeks incomplete. 60% death records submitted NCHS within 10 days date death, completeness varies jurisdiction. javascript.

disable it.

 believed science. Confidence... food wise man, liquor fool. -Vikram expecting second half title. Something along lines “...and officially requests succeed become Canadian province.” worst place way best, either. We're even close anymore. likely based type immune system Lets try again... Deaths rising, yes. death rate matters more. able fix people.

NY failed miserably. open there, get cases. unavoidable. point shutdown ""flatten curve"" keep hospitals overwhelmed. weren't. Unless vaccine, stopping apread.

Florida far hit high what? 156? NY topped like 950. state come close nearly 1,000 dead day. Hell, 2 weeks 600 daily deaths Yes. use Abbott 5 minutes tester white house. Made home state. (Maine)  idea wrong are. I’ll let someone else sort out. Obvious lies lmao 😆 three time, progress.  ‘What’s wrong tracing home?’ Four months ago CDC said wear masks. It’s shame ever read history book, first time. Officials wearing mask pledging solidarity Trump campaign. Somebody told tonight lockdowns cause spread. try nice, reply ""that's fucking stupid"". Lmao  Yes, thousands died random Canadian. Good assessment. Huh. Fair, certainly Chongqing; suppose said would substance affected city Chongqing instead. Sir enemy. smart people then. (: think it’s fact pull little harder nose/mouth. stop noticing always takes time “normalize” breathing within mask wear extended period time. Masks protect around thought , .. Florida coming ensure keep crown cases 'control' numbers, make claims case count far criminally miscounted imply worse is. meantime give guidance numbers justify schools reopening, businesses reopening, people going normal lives again.

In meantime actual contractions increase significantly starting end summer/early fall beginning school. Many people get sick die, horribly dramatic shutdowns around end October/beginning November. Election in-person turnout suppressed everyone worried getting sick, polling locations (of many closed reassigned fewer people go way vote) packed many wine even able vote close. People try vote mail, oh, what's that? head postal service replaced Trump croney, postal service bad financial state need money facing shut (they received real assistance many billion dollar companies gotten billions dollars); creating situation mail votes interfered (most likely people get ballots sent timely manner, able cast vote). vote count inevitably favors Trump series unbelievable events since pretty much everyone could intervene side current administration, Trump get re-elected.

That's what's going on. pray I'm overly paranoid wrong.

I'm sure get removed ""purely political,"" again, covid-19 testing USA point. America Hey idiot completely ignored things said directly refutes childish ""lol one number bigger smart"" assertions. trying push agenda? poorly single person buy it, even gullible ones. oxford vaccine, 5 years testing behind it, i'd trust it.

besides vaccines rushed, cutting red tape. concern know cases started can't trace line infection, knows many others well background. forget disabled immunocompromised. People chronic diseases like lupus, MS, RA, plus take meds organ transplant. Saving lot money (myself include) bite covid bullet. Queens well. least dumbasses masking stores still. spreading Orange country NY too. Inb4 idiots still wake accept reality. shocked? feel sick? obviously wrong then, even. simply honest said ""We enough masks, please hoard them"" (meaning buy them) we'd fine. Instead went insanely wrong admonition ""masks anything"" also ""we need front-line workers"" . . that's contrary *as is.* 

And that's created ridiculous bullsh\*t we're *still* fighting fight forseeable future. stupid idea, poorly managed, this. Doug Ford, actually premier Ontario (Rob Ford brother) actually said allowed, Mayor Toronto, federal government overruled said no. Kids 10 transmit well adults. That’s elementary school. real bro thinking vaccinated people get acces clubs exclusively  Maybe make bunch youtube videos Trump disbanded pandemic response team getting intel could let things get bad cancels election becomes dictator. think would go conspiracy theory crowd? might speeding moving things China, going take years would say hope sue, put price 22 human lifes. Im sure settle like 5 mill prob casinos one day profit. Fuck Vegas now. scumbags get voted elite positions power

I used hopeful social distancing. reminds whole you’re sleeping everyone partner slept with. You’re literally hanging everyone they’ve seen. Waaaaay grosser. MAKE PAY IT! grew Oklahoma. miss place all. bad there. don’t know COVID-specific studies (I imagine many progress) find cloth mask studies influenza, got viral particles that’re size. agree parents idiots, worry school staff getting “it’s flu” kids. win situation guess. live Illinois well Chicago. I'd say 95% people wearing masks. help wife former Mob lawyer, used mayor Vegas.

She probably getting lot pressure employers support closing casinos. Leaf peepers, that's simply adorable  people want think they're experts without actual research. Currently Florida Texas higher case counts per day New York did. don’t want give credit New York recent success saving American lives, that’s you, least wise enough learn solved problem. Instead states doubling stupid. makes sense. Remember couple months ago complaining China thing willfully doing?

Direct opinion made mistake. tried cover it, tried put out. like fire,"" Trump said. ""You know, really like trying put fire. put Remember guys us taxpayers... paying 6 figure salary every year.  moving goalposts see. thought PCR test took less couple hours? Nobody said anything PPV/NPV. works way lower volumes single use trade off. sure expect I’ll take look this. Thanks reasonable. Wow thank this. going comment mask protected him, others, great see research state otherwise    probably anti vaxxers anyway disagree, parties touted last stimulus package great, received emails state delegation saying good People hurting parties took break public suffers. People ready lose apartments houses, hear nothing substantial either side. Neither party fighting Medicare all, definitely Republicans, Democrats spent millions beat Bernie. one true party country Corporate party Another thing add interview Fauci time know fabric facemasks would beneficial. masks PPE hospitals needed facemask. decided general public conserve ppe hospitals make recommendation. 

Then got information fabric facemasks boom recommendation changed. 

Things change information life is. people can't that's problem understanding. 

When kid lucky carseat age 4 5. kids still 5 point harness age they're big rear facing. got data safer everyone rear facing crash. sued reckless negligence? ""Maybe wearing mask enough..."" put tape valve, easy peasy. Orange county basically Florida California. expected. Ignorant kids finally figure inevitable pandemics time time. 

Just build tornado shelter week tornado (which can't predicted precision), avoid game plan diseases late. skipped testing animals, started human trials, animal testing finished also working control listed cause death. there's reduced testing, undisclosed infection death counts (hospitals reporting HHS instead CDC) limit number death certificates reflecting COVID-19, plan seems bury truth deeply nobody accurately report bad Trump's narrative things better narrative available. Would counted corona virus regardless. good person.

""I didnt die, fuck everyone else"" Lol ok. Whatever say. reminds quote Rocky. ""He's blocking punches face!"" targeted advertisements need illegal! Tech companies forced charge subscriptions STOP stealing privacy. It’s breach privacy, causes things like it’s also mind altering. Google Facebook basically mine control people altering search results.

I math google Facebook one point. could charge $1 per month subscription fee users make money get stealing privacy altering people’s reality targeted content like currently.

It’s disgusting choose this, change dangerous corporations planet. Laws making illegal need passed. Highest Saturday think would good inclusion.  look carefully graph, deaths growing steadily up.

And no, followed New York’s recent success. States like Florida Texas case studies do. Florida right higher peak New York was, Texas looking same. New York recent success. rmb 

Is ""remember""? I've assured virtual real life armchair virologists earned degrees 3 weeks Facebook Meme University new born infants skeered Faux News Flu stayed home. Right?! Turns everyone wears masks less go business. Well, can't get drunk bars eating inside risky prospect, personal care services shut down? Turns wear masks still things. (I'm still concerned getting pedicure, think probably risk 15 minute hair cut long stylist mask.) Desantis enemy False. face coverings recommended simple barrier help prevent respiratory droplets traveling air onto people person wearing cloth face covering coughs, sneezes, talks, raises voice. called source control

That's first source backing masks protect people wearing people around them? 
  think there’s enough evidence say best benefit people COVID-19 protect giving COVID-19 people, you’re still going get benefit wearing mask don’t COVID-19,” said Chin-Hong.**  may effective “source control” prevent larger expelled droplets evaporating smaller droplets travel farther.**  factor remember, noted Rutherford, could still catch virus membranes eyes, risk masking eliminate.**

That's second. 

So thanks, given two sources backed point. Okie here, I’m sorry keep exporting stupidity. 

But #1 governors coronavirus that’s plus, aren’t #1 anything. Think thousands lives could save leaders actually cared it/took seriously. 

And way teach leaders real problem personally effects them. yes. wish governor would come severe case covid would benefit millions people supposed care elected represent. Great points totally understandable however it’s pretty darn important put aside care right now. honest, everything else pales comparison what’s happening care irresponsible foolish. goes people ages. There’s excuse extremely careful right now. incredibly difficult get children young keep masks on, teach touch mask wearing it. Somehow people forgot sane people actually want shop eat there's highly contagious virus raging neighborhood city.

There's valid economic response situation beats effective health response. Yeah, education (common scapegoat). societal selfishness egocentrism.

We're individualistic fault; us believe things effect us personally, many anything helps people unless explicitly helps us too. 

It's really education issue frankly understand commonly thought be. People deluded think tons highly educated, wealthy Republicans. Yes poorly educated socioeconomic groups right, could said left. Welp fuck  DeStupid sure. Heartbreaking. I'm sorry Florida. ... almost definitely. think New York ever Italy Spain style lockdown paperwork leave outside certain radius house. saw lots people know New York posting crowded green spaces getting takeout lockdown  recommend things, always consult doctor. medication help. lot people, enough. There's ton things tips have. got find works you.

- drink avoid high amounts caffeine. 
Think coffee, sodas, certain chocolates. still drink soda, try limit it. never took drinking coffee
- Avoid extreme heat. 
When lived Texas, would get episodes summer. Really hot long showers baths raise heart rate. still take warm baths showers, watch hot is. sweating, hot.
- well hydrated. dehydrated trigger episode. lips chapped? probably drinking enough water.
- Try regulate stress physical mental.
Physically regulating stress involves much sleep get well breathe. stressed out, affect breathing pattern, may taking shorter breaths, trigger episode. learning manage stress breathing exercises help. means exercise slowly build trigger it, too. Elaborating that, breathing back normal yet COVID, see issue. 

When experience episode, sit down, lay down, try relax. may feel mild chest pain cold sweats. maneuvers stop episode: 

If episode lasts long time, ER administer small shock regulate heart rate.

My doctor wanted go ER every episode get tests done make sure safe. would involve various blood tests chest X-Ray make sure fluid pushed lungs episode. common cough episode. mean full-on pneumonia.


The main thing identifying cause. Yes, developed post Covid, maybe Covid triggered something else body cause this. Maybe Covid still reason. primary care doctor order preliminary tests wait appointment cardiologist. medication take daily prevent episodes. figure happening develop plan there. developed condition 10 years old, doctors thought would grow it, didn't. reason ended getting procedure done react well medication. 

If heart monitor apple watch, capture EKG episode doctor use. used want buy smartwatch. works Bluetooth smartphone: certain smartwatches provide proper EKGs doctors trust, check purchasing one.

I literally printed EKG got went ER once, doctors needed fast track ER queue start testing.


I hope information helps hope feel well soon. Why? Emperor needs best people, MyPillow guy one best. Unlike heretic Fauci. Jared can’t everywhere, even though Jared also best. Like Stephen Miller. Also best. Tremendous.

/s thing is, they're rushed, cutting red tape. besides oxford vaccine based mers vaccine, 5 years testing, look up. Trump accused China doing... so, yet again, Trump projecting. Time lock everyone else administration accomplice murder every person dies. Spoken like someone whose experience US comes Reddit Facebook posts. Faze. phase. argument front, full agreement. literally opposite flatten curve, remember whole flatten curve extend lockdown exceed medical capacity graph literally everyone forgot !! #1 one responded idea talking about, can't see posts anyone inbox.

#2 where's original poster made claim 94% vaccine programs fail.

The average vaccine takes decade develop.

There never vaccine developed kind human coronavirus.

The research thus far make seem promising enduring immunity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm seeing anything proves SoCals infections protest. theory sure, evidence.

From saw protests, lots masks. True colors shining.

For last time, never said nurse. Show said I'll donate $20 charity choosing.

Take care around you. (And includes wearing mask.)

Try compassion dare, may find works wonders.

And lastly, think endgame here? conspiracy think afoot? insane hear govt health organizations claiming missing school damaging kids potential exposure. Pretty sure they're dead bring surprise home parents affect far delaying semester 2 school. market never crash long JPow controls printer. Never.

He indebt great grandchildren oblivion dow drops 15K.

No matter bad Covid cases get, gonna stimulus cheque stimulus cheque. Look going refute every point bring there’s point discussion. aren’t going change mind something I’m living every day. PA , accept risks continue work it’s right thing want help people. I’m satisfied level safety, certainly I’m fine compromising patient care poor planning hospital government. 

I already explained things could done better. met compliance doesn’t mean right. know, lot “compliance” crap bureaucratic ass covering anyways serves little way enhancing care. 

Telling quit find another job want better system example exactly system fails improve. Everyone angry. better.

And yes, course leadership wants electives draw revenue keeping electives open . think it’s absurd closed voluntarily back March/April &amp; furloughed workers handful cases region. things actually getting bad want stay open. Another example poor management risk assessment hospital admin. 

Like said, either see don’t. Thanks sharing perspective. isn’t reason it’s politics. reason Nazi Germany happened. Ok assess exactly long antibodies protective.

And okay many shun test requires drawing blood. Countries run deficits less noble reasons ""protecting lives citizens"". Since financial crisis, obscene amounts wealth built up. modern economies world afford this. unconscionable so. horizon may even years—it may weeks lockdown. America's case spent $2T fight wars Middle East—we spare fraction help citizens. Also 'A whole' think true. logo exactly same. Woolworths, yeah get that. went Target Australia nice US one, still definitely Target. getting anyone. Stay well! Also give continue face seemingly insurmountable odds really good options.

Like hope coronavirus quarantine ends. I'm still quarantining wearing mask, without hope eventual success, what's point? Well think it, US nothing like Italy.... They're far worse 61 year old mother also ICU RN.

Praying guys.

For worth, gets really bad, would think less leaving job. 


My mother 20+ years due retire 4 years now. told contemplate early retirement things go south. I'd rather Mom martyr family. Breaking: politician refused admit he/she wrong 8 week lag, though. Look closely deaths tracked behind cases March April (about six days.) month ago people saying ""Give couple weeks. Deaths lag behind cases four weeks."" two weeks ago people saying ""Give couple weeks. Deaths lag behind cases six weeks."" seriously going keep pushing another two weeks ad infinitum? point need acknowledge virus deadly months ago, either mutated weaker version society exposed low levels bit resistance now. *this good thing.* swear seems like people *want* spike deaths proven right keep getting unemployment bonuses something.  has. Stop obfuscating. Trump responsible actions talking here. literally people saying kids can't get spread it, want open schools need babysitting economy work.

They ignore science sake stock prices. think people downvoting seems like jumped high horse shame parenting though don’t talk kids. completely right possible cause (I psychiatric nurse practitioner therapist) kind pointed faulted parent comment though wasn’t talking kids, doubled explained reasons child’s stomach may hurt. I’m sure downvotes weren’t necessarily wrong; snarky, assuming, parent shaming stranger internet experiences child necessarily children’s experiences. Yes Great news. guys still lockdown? alright, so, naturally, tourism explodes fall, twice many people around, factor go away, yes? criminy fucking crapbaskets people thread...

and whole point ruralness unique stretch imagination, what's ""protected"" us far. America, Mammon worshiped? think not. dont get tested lol Yeah, doubt. Never said gonna pleasant. knows why? universe said so. really matter point. Lol dont even know put article might of. Sounds like ur using death propagate fear. Wow weird lined funneling data straight white house great day Italy.  made statement fitting narrative downvoted mod comes along bans ya. Enjoy Sunday!  doesn’t sound like bad life kids getting Kawasaki's multiple states countries? 

American parenting: Cry *experts* *everything;* froth mouth whenever someone *suggests* kids super spreaders. mean, like teachers kids ever get sick multiple times per year, right? Impossible save vast majority Americans normal times. Impossible even times. federal government got better. people deserve better. saying spending weeks inside small rooms thing spending couple hours outside times, terms risk catching infectious disease? would sign up. fact, app find people country’s love something think time (hello Italy)  Hours daylight sun say NC FL really different, average age resident - FL high cancers reason. Sun &amp; activity obviously play part, age. surprised. many parents insist kids safe can't carry disease without citing source. They're tired watching kids home Good them. anything set mind to, kids. Don’t let age obstacle.   Regardless, backlash answer simple question: cannot hold patients medically stable return NH hospital indefinitely especially time great need hospital beds. Field hospitals bureaucratic mess, process stream lined prepared either (for instance intended care non covid patients). federal government failed produce cohesive plan states would follow. Nursing homes across nation increasing staff arranging wards covid non covid patients. 


Your lack knowledge diseases spread also outstanding. Weeks kind lockdown patients come back forth nursing homes hospital already convalescing shedding covid 19. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT heed warning China Italy/Spain/France. repeat cannot keep patients hospital forever patients dying hallways ER 300% capacity. Difficult often bad decisions made politicians, praising Cuomo pandemic plays leadership follow science kind expert states governors forced act make difficult decisions. friend Chicago told - least - instructed keep mask upon approach server also wears mask. eat course remove rise go bathroom something, need put back on. call waiter table, coming order, need remask. agree behavioral, disagree reason. normal circumstances teachers staff enough safeguard prevent life threatening consequences. normal circumstances. Students adapt, quickly need to. 

I've seen models one grade level building day. makes sense. Then, we'd dealing 500-600 space designed 2000, we'd spread staff order spread students. Teachers gonna fuss that, think might ways address complaints. 

A blended instruction model la ""flipped classroom."" Students read watch material begin assignments home come school get help needed.

What's happening state ignoring cant follow guidelines going normal reduced extra-curriculars strong suggestion wear masks. supposed sanitizing happening classes, given difficult move hallways classes dont see happening.

In area, schools good giving lip service going do, dont put anyone charge actually making thing happen. never put anyone charge making thing happen never possible/feasible first place without systemic changes happening. Public schools train wreck since NCLB. wanna speak manager. /r/SuddenlyOnlyFans US govt still arguing testing. Good job Europe.. US trouble. tested Thursday (after contact tracing says may exposed) still waiting results. Developed symptoms Friday morning. I’ve spent day Friday past two days trying get rapid test know sure, everywhere around :( 

Basically fever (low oral fever usually 100.6 without fever reducing meds.) high body temp armpits (as high 102.5) seems super weird me. also feel extremely tired, chills try see fever without medicine, headache, slightly nasal mucus normal. hungry, I’ve also weight loss medicine 2 months that’s limited ability taste idea it’s medicine really can’t taste much ... sucks. it’s lol.
Many presidents, given shit majority American people. 

Jesus Christ look founders set rigged voting system rest racist slave owners followed suit.

Our cities built bodies dead slaves.

What get return? Mass graves. 

The least shitheads could legalize good drugs spend money saved universal income all. Anyone kids school works school knows breeding ground disease schools are.  Add bizarre inability people understand kid gets probably get sick, anything passing family.  school test sick kids send back home isolate them? Oh yeah worst really think that's going Arizona. think like we'd seeing really high test positivity rates even lot testing. hope I'm right though Arizona really bad place right excess mortality trajectory badly hit places eastern seaboard. video good resource ADD/ADHD people screen work/learning home. left behind federal government PISSED. country got change. moved beyond everyone paid sick leave, job security, universal health care. then, remains reality. idiots far gone. Trying appease change minds wastes time could used save people.  That’s awesome hear, means current situation US months go getting point. Change title "" Anti-Vaxxers say mask really matter"", would maybe sway people already know matter... Oooh... like nature, playing Labrador retriever, reading history books, Oxford commas. sky blue... So, yes? Haha poly person dumped right covid19, yea, hear you. supposed younger kids thought?

Not like take day time. reality would different?? video submitted thru reddit, reliable half shit let through. sad Cuomo taking heat Governor DeSantis Florida refused close beaches despite health officials even Trump personally pleading so, one worst hit states country. Governor Abbott TX Kemp GA refusing mandate masks causing massive death tolls. responsible governor held harsher standard? It’s maddening. That’s awesome Glad moved fucked place.  Pretty sure people figure out, worry it. consider difficult decision make, ultimately right one. One hardest resources pandemic scale (I'd argue even harder N95s, testing, ventilators) healthcare professionals. Keeping safe healthy appropriately seen paramount. sounds like perfect time children go back school. think coverage earlier get enough blame. media want seen reason stock market tanking generally downplayed far have. Then, NY started slightly improving, like “first wave over!” can't say here. Karenmommies froth mouth. mean, dare even suggest American parents partly responsible pandemic?! 12% positive improvement, everything else bad. local news guy arguing flu worse death rate doesn’t qualify COVID pandemic. Facebook said must true. Come Missouri BBQ, stay cheap heroin. wonder people could make huge sacrifice neither couple weeks.   like ignorant shit upvoted lol

I spent much money college people need die successful fucking entitled shitty probably compared numbers ignored kids home 4-5 months. kids shopping working likely last ones home catch it, there's one left spread to. Summer camps closed, daycares closed hardly many reopened, schools closed early on, US rules children couldn’t go public even adults able start moving around again. Young children absolutely sheltered group far. Even families sick tests early short supply tested ones showing symptoms seriously ill. Even kids getting virus able spread showing symptoms weren’t tested put environment would see that. schools reopen see. posted links US States reopened daycare centers seeing children spread COVID. LOL problem people (who going die anyway, agree) die horrible way. Without beloved ones them. high rate what... teach special education. kids always school, regardless sick are. literally call parents’ work get respond messages child vomiting school. Parents give kids meds hide illness sending us ... teacher immunocompromised, terrified school year. question get right perspective, gets tested florida? people symptoms, random somehow?  even read article comments? Coroner conducting autopsy find young kids like drop dead. rightwing thing.

Ontario Liberals allowed 10 sick days per year. Ford came slashed 3 unpaid days. shocked Pikachu.png Online learning spring joke .5 seconds shift model. summer, finding week online learning takes 2 weeks full time planning online content creation. Unfortunately seems like best option right teachers learned lot / work nightmare online learning spring. 

I'm really sorry senior year ended shitty way. except intentionally. wear N95 mask still get extremely anxious unmasked idiots walk anywhere near me. I've noticed small cough mask nice sniffle walk far away me. walk right think 'she's safe, wearing mask therefore threat me'. Also staring people masks chin seems produce response people putting mask on. 

These behaviors tell people understand it, cannot bothered right thing unless 1) worried might get sick 2) publicly shamed morons. man, live shittest place France respecting rules &amp; compliance, care: paris &amp; surrounding. lived year , much stupidity &amp; bad people/behaviour.But living near Metz. Everyone wears damn mask train East. You’re misunderstanding terms. “Currently infected” means actually currently active infection. You’re confusing “total infected,” currently infected plus recovered plus dead. healthy 13-year-olds drop dead

They do. Stop using word anti science. ideology believe not. fact period. either scientific stupid. Darwin said best. article also says idea even works, seems problematic me. Useless article.  'Most young people would heal day.' Mr karlpilkington, lie able find least recorded account person overcoming covid one day. 

I help out. find it, happen. Trump lying. keep walking around without mask, gonna catch gay virus. happens, saying “real men” gonna mean something else. 

:D offense, said chair ethics committee approving the, guess, phase 3, trial? wtf know vaccin available? Usa(eastern) U.K time? Oh god. Perfect.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  agree lil guy, stupidity worth getting mad over. Especially crystal clear anyone wrong are. This!!! I've watching vaccine development group start thought showed tremendous potential. would take vaccine heartbeat. Resistance really need. resistance COVID, really would bad flu. shouldn’t to. That’s fair :-( concern becomes available week two United States election, it'll immediately become ""democratic conspiracy steal election"" remember said useful that? probably intending leave weeks end answer I've seen, since see bodies real happy anyone working vaccine arrives, create low-pressure environment minimal visibility reasons mention. 

That never happen given current climate. I'm also curious basing anecdote raw intuition. Neither means anything. 


I totally get keeping expectations low, we've keeping low while. people trust confident. I'll let feel good that. Could someone explain happen September? impression test vaccine quite ensure safe (I feel like saw something said 18 months back?). Hiw roll something soon know long term side effects. really want ti wrong honestly want learn help would appreciated. explain importance masks hour conservative family members. Exhausting.  long remain world reserve currency, nothing much.

We could well see deflation, Japan printing decades, buys equity ETFs, bonds etc done anything them.

Ultimately demand problem. Short non stop helicopter money consumers inflation long term. Buying bonds adding liquidity giving mom pop 2k extra month. One greases liquidity risk sentiment demand.

Untimely money chases fewer fewer growth companies bubble breaks due economy becoming top heavy see market biased towards going up. people decide areas world better growth. coming, quite yet. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Lol imagine comparing 108 cases 77 thousand new cases trying make seem like mask dont help God either. What's crazy every thing still shit pre pandemic HUGE, unbuckle pants Thanksgiving, relief. 3m top mass produced. abundance sources mask based simplicity. Well read loud clear that.

Not Debbie downer get flu shot every year. Read top reply want say reading making happy. dropped high school kid due severe classroom anxiety, although straight-A student. environment work me, know lot people went school refusal ended dropping out. wish options available. I've since done degree bunch diplomas online. lot people position traditional classroom really considered mainstream option, filling joy see things could change discussions happening. Thank doing. Read top reply course not. Wasn’t blaming you. general commentary unserious shitty headlines.  Magical thinking stop fucking virus.  Yeah, I’m sure inflation occur - least regular every day items. Instead think money could flow assets, creating bubble stocks, Art, high end products. one looks Japan you’ll notice suffer *deflation* 60% debt monetized Bank Japan. essentially means printing money. think maybe longer use actual currency, effects “printing” money different would normally happen. don’t know. It’s very, weird. OP here.

I hadn’t seen one before. Sorry. article posted dated two days ago. Nursing homes risky.
In austria one outbreak many residents died.
Overall 40% 700 deaths far austria elderly people living sort nursing home. I’m certified teacher haven’t worked classroom couple years. Suddenly, getting calls interviews haven’t past years. Nooo thanks. want it’s going crap fest? thanks! MEWS FLASH KIDS DIRTY Thank Winnie Xi fastest developed vaccine history took 4-5 years, simply realistic expect process suddenly reduced mere months. airnb gf kids, daughter gf don’t want full tent wilderness experience compromise. going full camping fishing Waiting 15 days test here. don’t know think anymore. get hurting/punishing risking infection death. aka Actual camping. Ga ha ha ha ha! America baby. ice cream trucks. Hospitals give away free ice cream every visit. going start doubting test results narrative? Really? kid died. COVID. use death selfish reasons. think they're describing ""species"" level problem, ""American"" problem. Plenty countries handled better did. Don’t forget occupational therapists!  Fine me, helps counter massive voter suppression one party. now, difficult task convincing people take it. wait day two, you’ll find died talking non valved respirators, that's irrelevant discussion Americans buy them, knowledge can't. 

I got box them.

Additionally, cover valve operate normal masks, point believe small amount. tried non valved KN95s, generic blue surgicals. Almost nothing exhale comes front. goes sides eyes(even adjusting metal strip). truly capturing bad stuff hits masks would great, believe that.

If true, nonvalved versions would need exist. would *the* standard clean room sterile medical facilities. valved respirators would standard. not. guess why? Oh, going answer, then. Great. 

Every intervention risk benefit. risk thousands deaths outweighs risks children staying home, particularly interventions alleviate problems associated latter without causing undue increase disease spread. 

That answer questions. Thank much, country hard family care quarantine, come go, party, walks add job too... hard... ex husband chronic, baby need healthy order keep alive even living together anymore... problemo man. US, politicians using studies, like Dutch one, applying be, state 14000 new daily cases positive rate 20%.

A lot us understand science edgy hell here. 

Since seem science guy, might interest I’d interested thoughts —albeit it’s influenza study rather Covid study, brings interesting seriousness though, prime hurricane season almost I'm worried hell major hurricane hits us Texas Florida covid spiking.

For one, millions people evacuated inland hotspots taking virus en masse. Secondly hits, thousands people put large close groups temporary shelters like high school gyms, event centers, etc. many people tend come poorer backgrounds without health insurance much safety net.

It's hard enough get teams disaster relief personnel disaster relief money bad hurricanes normal circumstances. city hit large portion population even jobs go back they've invested rebuilding? probably won't. true, hearing IndiaTVNews? Counters gross. swear could grow plants amount spittle people shed talk noise crowds store. cannot count number parents handed wet toy scan toddler gnawing on. Sometime I’m tempted lick credit card hand back soggy see feel it.

I wear glasses. idiot acquaintance mine claimed shed infectious droplets cough, regular breathing always dry. So, zoom call expounded this, pulled glasses off, breathed twice fog completely, wiped off. “Really? moisture normal breath, huh? That’s interesting.” hung him. rapid inflation event would collapse economy. Want see depression? Let’s watch value dollar get cut 90% They're at-risk manufacturing. is: they've ramping production months, hoping it'll get approved (which likely end Phase 3 trials, typically include years follow-ups). speeds things dramatically.  camp still, like tent. Find place allows primitive camping pick spot far away people. need supplies entirely though: shelter, food, water, fire small shovel. Yes, saying justify schools reopening, ignores potential spread caused Hey man, believe that’s prediction— people would’ve level-headed, responsible, self-regulating leaving precious n95 masks healthcare workers. 

The epidemiologists leading expert infectious disease reason think otherwise. want say? god damn nose too, eh.

While I'm it. Follow fucking arrows floor loblaws back hell up.  economics understander logged on, folks. Rest Peace brother. Bethel. Granted, told couple/few weeks ago now. unless personal care. Even make excuse write bad luck. leaving doorstep? meet car? there's chance kind interaction non-household member mask up! Even pass thru apartment's lobby, since might encounter group guests neighbors chatting without masks, hanging around.  Im not, going wait till gone. Jay Leno, ladies gentlemen. Enjoy buffet! 90% world, yes, *does* seem like things going well.

This sub focuses hardest hit 10%.  Alright... people exhaling inside buildings? Fucking morons bringing shit months even make sense. false negative rate high first days exposure/infection took day two exposure test result isn’t terribly reliable negative. five days false negative rate drops lot that’s also symptoms start develop, average. studies said young kids don’t transmit corona. Since children exhibit inflammation symptoms necessarily cough, weren’t producing aerosolized droplets. 

I’d imagine they’re trying narrow age range COVID starts show lungs contagious. I’ll honest, it’s weird still hung things said weeks crisis *and one masks anyway*. Nursing homes really ""ravaged"" New York percent COVID deaths. Much lower states actually. New York general ravaged. point people missing NY phenomenal plan place right accounts scenarios COVID threat levels going forward. know states much detailed plan. data science, look it. People want hate NY, sadly missing remarkable work keep people safe. track September, soon could society start get back normal? soon could countries open border? Would social distancing end? feel like lot people need vaccine get back normal. Dunno yet.... stock market economy pretty much place gains made. economy production, either physical assets services. Taking produce economic gains, debt accumulation along asset inflation. stimulus done little help economy. prop'ed giant economic bubble including stock market building last decade, helped allow perhaps largest wealth transfer history (poor rich), addition temporarily keeping people afloat.

All need paid back future, either increased taxation decreasing USD value inflation (printing money cover debt's interest, silent form taxation particularly hits lower middle classes hard).

The good solution containing virus. Money free. needs come somewhere US already strapped cash monetary policy pushed limits. **Our interest national debt alone surpass entire defense budget.** serious trouble. Nah, called pants head retarded. country. world shittier place close

OVER 100 MÅ KARANTENE BERGEN

To av tre personer som testet positivt coronaviruset lørdag, har oppholdt seg Bergen smitteførende fase. Kommunen jobber nå med å finne ut hvor alle har vært, og det kan være snakk om et tresifret antall smittede, skriver Bergens Tidende.
De smittede har blant annet oppholdt seg på treningssenter, spisesteder og kollektivtransport. Brita Øygard, direktør Etat helsetjenester, sier til BT det kan være langt hundre karantene når smitteoppsporingen er ferdig.
Kommunen er kjent med de smittede har oppholdt seg på treningssenter, kjøpesenter og brukt kollektivtransport. De jobber nå med å ringe rundt til dem som har vært kontakt med de smittede.
– Jeg vet ikke om vi rekker å ringe alle dag, sier hun.
Øygard sier videre det ikke er alle som er Bergen lenger. De det gjelder, må testes kommunen de oppholder seg Possibly got live years road.  wasn’t able alter headline, unfortunately. Jesus....now starting believe Karma real either... RIP sucked someone's snot! Ewwwwww..... covid snot worst too. US trying hard break record. isnt olympic guys, take easy. American pride real chemistry degree dude! Clearly he’s vaccine *expert* delay starts precedent. like crossing Rubicon; turning back point One guy sub tried argue population density NY/NJ what’s causing lots people died, even disproportionally. brought areas large populations total deaths similar deaths per million, contrary fact NY/NJ leading categories, bugged lol. even pointed CA/PA density, amount deaths, horrible given California’s total population size PA’s lower case numbers.

Pro tip: anyone sub deviates facts bring results name-calling, know hit nerve lol. sucks pandemic could’ve curved way earlier people would wear masks. fair Illinois corruption apolitical. left/right thing, politician thing there. data want send you? There's plenty. Zew Zealand, 22 Propaganda, Facebook, dinosaur politicians know stand chance getting elected busy worried non existent economic futures thanks moronic knee jerk reactions moron. determine whether vaccine works comparing placebo. determine results comparing placebo. It’s it’s worked hundreds years successful. Nah, Mets - Yankees, exhibition game (kinda like spring training). Yeah, take numbers overall death graph sum week (e.g. June 28th + June 29th + June 30th + July 1st + July 2nd + July 3rd + July 4th report number July 4th) get

July 4th: + 4127

July 11th +5101

July 18th +5326

So 30% increase 2 weeks. go day earlier hopefully get full day's report, its

July 3rd: +4393

July 10th: +4660

July 17th: +5163

I think maybe way recording data needs re-evaluated bit. Yes, Trump’s criminal bungling mishandling evident. guess I’ve never seen actual evidence deliberate undercounting experts saying “we’re sure there’s undercounting”. may need wait that, won’t deny it’s happening.

I agree second paragraph specifically driving narrative. play devil’s advocate, could wrong? One thing always want solidify understanding something like purposely prove wrong going routes disagree with. case, data lacks much transparency (as in, would LOVE database pulled counties’ case, hospitalization, ICU, death stats, addition demographics, excel form, that’s wishful thinking) can’t entirely convinced they’re undercounting overcounting. 

So go gut, traditional media overplayed moral panic scenario yet can’t hold accountable. We’re currently seeing journalism industry whole going significant turmoil right now, basically every rock needs turned over.

Sorry know rambling really respect responding this. frustrated, confused angry leaders top pandemic almost way. admit never get control? always someone isn’t showing symptoms. It’s going something live with. Unless island country state, it’ll impossible eradicate.  knew countries, North Korea would one refuse join world wide conspiracy make Trump look bad? Wow 702 new cases 25 new deaths. 692 hospitalizations 232 icu beds. 

The cost Freedumb. sad innocent. saying MUCH lower even know now, like, saying level flu, didnt need taking precautions, definitely know isnt true. Yes, putting Covid patients nursing homes correct thing do.  Pacing FTW  14-year-old subject next sentence I've thinking... great they're keeping low, get vaccine effective treatment, things remain way are.. Neve give 2018* Governor Oklahoma. There’s nothing deaths. New York’s deaths new infections per day way peak. SOMETHING right, rest us try figure what. make mistakes, I’m sure it’s possible improve did. governor state things aren’t going well right now, would definitely asking Cuomo ideas. wearing mask irrelevant mask would kept getting Covid. can't know 99.99% people reinfected months longer. Even loss immunity starts soon 3 months, would apply 5% US cases far (edit: even little 1 2%, depending shape distribution loss immunity median lies), 3 months case, would instant cases, likely roughly normal distribution. median distribution could 6 months 9 12 --- would entirely consistent small handful cases showing now.

I necessarily believe case (in fact I'd bet forced choose) certainly cannot ruled statistically point. wasnt. got health conference. I’ve literally argued once. clearly mistake. Fauci saying, agree, New York learned last months far best plan put place stop spread virus, 100% true based evidence data. Says article many others like posted earlier. offering treatment people ended recovering fine media got involved. absolutely right cultural difference treat elderly. US, drag painful lives let die dignity. wish, respect, like Scandinavians. flip side letting people could otherwise recover die they're lumped old people poor prognosis survival recovery. mean killing thousands old people nursing homes “winning” good job? Really?? It’s news everyday ! media trying discourage toxic belief , others encourage , interviewing andreas Kalcker , man doesn’t traditional medic studies . It’s social networks too! (Facebook) Even guardian’a article it’s people still wanna believe “doctors don’t wanna accept cure pharmacy market lose ton money” ... it’s really sad/embarrassing honest youre gonna hold block party wear masks Id say youre caring, choose ignorant wont die therefore you’re good F everyone else........Listen science, man. Thats gotta do. Well....thats - 

Be hero. world loves heroes yet seeing less heroes......Youd think Marvel DC movies etc hero would resonate greatly society, apparently not.... nursing homes seriously mishandled? number deaths skyrocketed Cuomo heartbreaking.
Friends loved ones died that. husband started stashing money buying extra non-perishables January. I'm grateful did. eligible unemployment, never able get apply. Oxford vaccine comes through, expect Trump claim victory Warp Speed US exceptionalism, though reality UK's work (with clinical study help South Africa Brazil) daughter teacher 30 years.. thankful CA holding person schooling. want mother die child needs semester's worth English.  could happened? comes back bite ass. sending sick people COVID nursing homes certainly wasn’t great idea. think initial horrible mistake they’ve done well. wish came shock me. past 3 years, nothing does. Stupid Oklahomans lmao.  Also asking stop paying taxes schools closed. Where’s sources prove “facts?” ""giving"" economy; covid cripple doubt. November. anti-maskers, anti-lockdowners Republicans. acting like politicians care getting re-elected know ever be. let surge. volunteer staff polls people dropping dead streets? carry mail half USPS sick? go crowded indoor polls catch plague?

The way ppl stay power end democracy. they're Sadly many, MANY idiots make vast majority ~~my state~~ country.

Getting really difficult believe case. adult height probably plays roll. logical think someone breathing face level risk someone breathing near belly button.  haters need sit fuck down. wouldn’t want live anywhere else right now. first hand experience always thebest way learn Well sounds like data ""flawed"" general case positivity rate, right? Early on, people symptomatic could get tested. *that* representative general population?

But doesnt seem like claims baseless now.

(From highly publicized studies antibody test results Stanford USC researchers — **also suggesting virus’ true spread community much higher expected resulting death rates comparatively low** — similarly criticized sampling bias poor reliability tests used. again, politicians media favor reopening states right away cited supporting evidence.

I mean .. exactly say now, isnt it? ""The virus spread much higher expected resulting death rate comparatively low"". It’s 2020. Everything become politicized 😔 think time teacher strike First off, truck driver goes Canada regularly American.

I would even allowed cross Canada work (only Canadian citizens essential traffic allowed cross). Even so, top this, allowed exit truck things essential job must wear face covering risk $1200 fine. terms tracking I’m going, need look log book GPS records locations. 

The restrictions quite impressive (and necessary considering idiocy fellow Americans regarding pandemic).

Edit: might well add CVSA certified cop (typically state weigh station cops states, would say many RCMP Canada criteria) pull look logbook without probable cause well. I'm certain broke way think, print money. said, demonstrate economy efficient fragile. like driving sports car 130mph super tight suspension whole thing made glass. great going fast, accident whole thing shatters. Chubbyemu's long lost twin? Covid 19 also 17 known strains. vaccine would need effective strains. news sadly gonna fly closed ears. People believe masks don’t work going swayed facts. It’ll take get likely die change minds Two points consider:

1. Philippine population young. Median age 24.1 compared 38.5 US 41-47 Western Europe.

2. Philippines little testing compared developed nations, active cases fraction actual infections. bad one: I’m encouraging New Yorkers go lives + get town despite Coronavirus, thought would offer suggestions. Here’s first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see “The Traitor” @FilmLinc
. “The Wire” true story + set Italy, would PM · Mar 2, 2020·Twitter iPhone

Can believe thinks Wire true story? Sure. Wherever need learn handle pandemic, go that.

It's competition. joke right? putting Covid people nursing homes? Im ashamed say im afraid dying,or getting covid.Also fear keeps safe,its ememy.remember guy wasnt afraid grizzly bears, well ,he got killed grizzly. I'll take ""not snowball's chance hell"" $200,Alex. named phone's hotspot ""5G_COVID_Spreader"", help. fact early positivity rates useful validate 2 doctors coming saying means everyone already it, I'm willing hold medical professionals higher standard randoms reddit. recall serious discussions case positivity rate last month. Everyone understood good measure, kind like understood (NY deaths/NY case count) probably great estimate IFR. Discussions started centering around metric last month broader testing occurred concerns inaccuracy surfaced around available antibody tests. already seeing people start question use metric test shortages ramp back up. last person saw seriously touting desantis, hit face week later like things says do.  I'm curious hear new Yorkers standpoint makes say this? data referencing? data Virginia’s health department back up, I’m curious got from? last monthly update said seems tho latinx population disproportionately affected latinx non-Hispanic black people show higher rates covid 19 er visits. 

I could wrong, haven’t seen anything shows white people disproportionately affected. Stitt, Stitt

You shit

Get hell out

Of government that's vaccine might feasibly available USA October. They've agreed manufacturing USA, others said, it'll prioritised key workers.

I hope would include election workers, depends number available doses. fact, they'll probably list NFL players Kanye West.

Though mRNA vaccines might demonstrated efficacy then, would want see long-term safety data I'd take it. Sure kids testing 30% positivity rate Florida shown damage chest X-rays....they never even got symptom. children biggest group lab rats United States ever had. Thankfully mine won’t it. Yeah, pretty dishonest post way was. sort recourse? sue something? supposed measures place protect us someone like him? No, no. manage ARDS. whole “happy hypoxemic” (which one biggest misnomers time) phenomena promoted physicians experts ARDS don’t publish ARDS lead delays care complications pneumomediastinum. Intubation also much riskier procedure patients optimally preoxygenated allowed progress critical hypoxemia. 

Select patients COVID-19 supported non-invasively high flow nasal cannula, select patients non-invasive positive pressure ventilations, i.e. BiPAP, like viral pneumonia undifferentiated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, progress ARDS best care mechanical ventilation supportive care, including lung protective strategies. 

I don’t know make outrageously high mortality published Northwell, wasn’t experience centers, including much lower mortality ventilated patients. mortality similar ARDS patients. 

Beth Israel Deaconess published data [in American Thoracic Society supports well: evidence based ARDS care leads good care COVID-19 patients progress ARDS. Throwing twenty years evidence progressively lead improved care ARDS patients SARS-CoV-2 novel entity isn’t rational potentially harmful. mean patients get intubated immediately? No. never goal intention. patients need intubated don’t. advocation “early” intubation due fear nosocomial spread SARS-CoV-2 via non-invasive techniques seen SARS especially MERS. fear spreading accidentally negative patients staff (as seen SARS MERS). know high risk period nosocomial spread early pandemic high level PPE precautions aren’t taken standardized. We’ve seen correct PPE risk staff minimized successfully treat subset patients non-invasive ventilation (HFNC, BiPAP). doesn’t mean shouldn’t intubating patients require would benefit intubation. Says who? China...or Italy... article month old. posted still relevant new information?

Why trying give ammo deniers plague rats? Great 🙌  death rates parts country increasing rapidly. We'll see happens Georgia Florida full throttle open schools. Iowa easy one. One highest percentages seniors country. Never locked never stay home order. Lots ppl IL came/will come avoid restrictions. Largely rural state feel need wear masks. reasons too, think covers Man. people live rocks. Probably wise send money directly states case. Shouldn’t trust guy faithfully execute given track record. That's lockdown data idiot. lot Canadians arent really caring honest, young old  One nation one wave RemindMe! 1 month

Does New York still deaths FL, TX, GA, OK, MO, IN, OH combined? *Aziz, light!!* tell Macron data suppressed, like USA. Problem solved. literally way besides impeachment House removal Senate stop president.

There’s also 25th amendment, good luck getting pence cabinet go along that. I'm 55. Lived Reagan, Bushes..i embarassed thought Reagan terrible 20 traveling Europe. tell NEVER time country divided legions idiots, many ""educated"" enabled proud flout selfish, ignorant views. truly want leave country issue teachers high risk contracting disease, unlike jobs. teachers get flu every year unless get flu shot. Kids bring sorts diseases school, also bring COVID. teachers unreasonable. sounds like one bitching others speak minds. ... Except phenomenon limited COVID-19. Everyone ""smarter ""better informed"" experts. People assume voice *can* heard social media *should* heard. essential workers. ever watch move ”I Legend” I've news junky like rest sub think I've seen ""this huge!"" Articles misleading. 

Articles reporting vaccine testing reaching next stage pretty optimistic, overly so. Why? Lol 
Retired teachers going older older people risk.
Let’s recruit elderly back see mind risking death come back thankless job already paid due time in. 
Gee see they’re confused many responding back? It’s mystery sure. course read article! see title like run it. fuckin duh. Thanks. hope Don’t tell Q people. say quite easily since people making tht call dont care ab well beings sad truth Utterly naive think plans necessary relation reality. Utterly farcical cling fantasy China communist. capitalist society heavy state ownership ruled autocracy. need expand response beyond Trump. Republican ticket helping Trump kill people. Every one needs office. Evolution's engine humans thin herd low intellect. animals traits enable find nitch life. product 0.0001% earlier generations. 99.9999% humans live long enough children. Sobering. link study? get Oxford vaccine second can. old tech, proven safe shown great results far.  


I reservations mRNA vaccine simply mRNA vaccines still new - thing available said could take right now. would. body ready.  know parents ignoring public health put lives danger name avoiding mild inconvenience, trust me: teenagers perfectly responsible respectful authority, public health, evidenced-based best practices. 150k+ people 5 months. 

That's 90% wars America ever involved in, including civil war WW1

We're nowhere near done it. 

How bad people made be?

Less 10k people died 911. Covid killed 16x people 911 did. far. that's even start looking average deaths year vs past. 

This idea bad comes (in opinion) idea impacting you/people know, bad. Americans country (not ""shithole"" country, Americans) lost entire family covid. thousands thousands going major health complications rest lives covid. 

It's bad. panic, overreact, understand really bad need start taking shit seriously. Thank you!

The world needs math teachers help average adult exponential growth — read basic charts skyrocketing right now. friends Philly? Going bars, clubs, places lot people get infected?
Are friends prepared wear masks appropriate, including flight?
Are staying busy hotel can't avoid contact travelers?
Are prepared quarantine back home?
Do anyone household underlying conditions put risk? Europe European Union combined deaths USA... means actual cases (not identified ones) isn’t hard people. Wow, thanks sharing story. sort information needs get people. may feel day's job truly valuable hear people saving lives...

Also know sounds corny many healtcare workers thanked service feel downright admirable dutifully helping people. mean, phase 1(safety) results released tomorrow morning Lancet. opinion lost job mean reason. Keep mind. opinion. compare total cases Europe total cases United States it’s higher US 😐 relax I’m jus going numbers see agree you, it’s generally easier target blame something tangible like terrorist organization something like mental illness. It’s also easier understand. agree, likely suspect, extensive contract tracing indicates rode market human. What’s more, initial transmission chains connection market. come get folks actually socially responsible get test

A chance win $50? worried wording got ankle bracelet?

Not much common sense. There's also fact newer New York hit. Outcomes hospitalized improved greatly they've learned treat it. process typically takes years rushing less 8 months? Even vaccine developed similar virus human body chemistry sensitive bc safe one virus mean safe another. Like said, I'm provaxx rushed vaccine solution many experts saying likely take another 18 months seen proportionate rise deaths? would require change work culture US also paid time Nice fear porn bruh  Even 50% reported deaths fabrications, would STILL place America 70,000 “real” COVID deaths, right behind Brazil number 1 spot. media might lie, people like straight DUMB giving disease due caution. shit. Haha yeah exactly ""Its like one death Let's open schools""- Politicians Uh, duh? paid study? ""Requiring"" needs change ""enforcing"". still see lot people wearing masks unless push enforcement dragging feet. It’s really fucked makes wonder..

Do kids wear helmets? wear seatbelts? use condoms? wash hands touching raw meat? Ah, man. one hand, good them. other, already neurological condition involves lot symptoms nobody seems willing able help me, maybe mine clear cause :( Trying decide mask best use. took 3 N95s dad’s house beginning pandemic, I’ve rotating - wearing one walking “quarantining” someone comes close days (I don’t go anywhere else would bring contact anyone). know aren’t really meant reusable, even though I’m making sure avoid touching potentially contaminated mask, I’m wondering filter would damaged time masks would become less protective regular cloth mask. Anyone thoughts this? would ask countries socialized health care extra people hospital because.... density identify cases? Certainly parked 86 days Europe, generally speaking, much better health care system US, especially poor. don’t think it’s going type situation get pick choose vaccine take even one distributed EU.

With many people asymptotic shouldn’t biggest risk get vaccine? young people traveling, wearing mask getting sick...i don’t see importance getting vaccine.

I wear mask 24/7 outside house. Work home probably end year. Fauci said everyone wore mask would control weeks. live Illinois confirmation rate less low 2% death rate dropping. don’t see reason get vaccine 3+ months numbers. like you, like everyone? can't argue logic... Nope, inside store. Inside lobby area there's long stretch carts chips seasonal food get shopping baskets flowers. One baskets one flowers. Nowhere near outside store. high school senior reading ur right, ppl age dont care virus know wont affect directly selfish quarantine rather party socialize virus already growing fast jus think gonna b everybody said deserved spring break went beach starts hanging one building like petri dish tht point, worst part probably gonna b little kids like elementary since immune system isnt even fully developed im choosing go least first weeks im imagining see dumb idea like tht school stays ill probably go month in.   ""Agreed. It'd pretty inconvenient kids able spread thing."" first year get flu shot chance get it.

I got flu early Mar, wiped out. I'll definitely getting shot next season. Really anyone political agenda. 

Rule #1 never let good crisis go waste. 100% backed research science. It’s called “working memory”. mental inabilities comprehend purpose social distancing wearing mask. It’s real thing. Tons articles studies past week.

So yes, true, wear masks social distance mental handicap way. It’s interesting study explains much way US failing properly educate people using types learning styles, especially styles low working memory, obviously big percentage US population. I’d get GED start online community college instead. know there’s stigma around GEDs think go away given times.  Agreed. article NBC News. Well, NBC? Where’s real story here? talking people talking it. take it. Anything get us back normal, take heartbeat. Where’s at? took dad Home Depot yesterday needed truck bring something home. didn’t go reason waited keeping track many people wearing masks. 

I lost count everyone except one person wearing mask. maybe 30 minutes decent amount people. BRING Oh come on. goal make money provide masks free trump rallys? Fucking war profiteer. 

Go back Marketing 101 present horseshit wording way someone buys it.

Also read fucking rules idiot. Best news. “Cases need stop counted cases.”  
Whaaaaa? Maybe, maybe not. New York higher infection rate Florida peak, enough tests time capture it. NYC higher population density public transportation people actually use made spread faster really ever could Florida. Also, advances covid treatment, actually effective drugs now. Florida also probably stress healthcare system.

Part New York bad virus infected nursing homes though Florida definitely New York does. Florida allows happen deaths skyrocket. hurricane season right around corner, Florida Texas COVID...maybe nuking hurricanes back table Donny whole inject bleach thing quite work out? successful despite brigaded biggest imperial country world ever seen.

If don’t know contextualize that, I’m sorry. [My title. I'm tired this. Population density hard concept grasp apparently /s Yeah, comes crowd defended bigoted bakeries' right make wedding cakes. idiots anti-vaxers making death threats various businesses across country. recommend sub /r/PublicFreakout follow.  university requiring us submit ""significant hardship"" ""means change circumstances beyond student’s control, occurs after"" deadline ""which negatively impacts student’s ability attend class campus"" order go online missed deadline back June opt online learning instead person classes. 

I really want get virus possible. asthma, April testing widely available, around somebody tested positive couple days seeing him. later online screening nurse diagnosed ""likely positive"". want risk possibly getting vaccine again.

What's best way frame argument Covid-19 school go back person? US manipulates data isn’t entirely accurate. virus smaller n95 quotes take acccount static electricity benefits mask basically sucks particles threads. Additionally, since particles small don’t actually go straight. it’s like lining bunch tennis nets trying throw bb through. Except air, million items flying every way cause bb bounce unable travel straight line. Everyone needs n95 better goal since March, admin idiots, so... math. Wear best mask avoid people you’re vaccinated. Europe UK Spain Italy France. 

The population Europe 740 million people. EU countries around 440 million people. Asymptomatic spread incredibly rare. 40-60 percent infections asymptomatic 6 percent spread caused asymptomatic people. spend lot time sub, may confused people overwhelmingly lying asymptomatic spread combining presymptomatic spread form propaganda influence people. 

You might actually making opposite point think may actually describing reason children don’t spread virus. realized Stupidity Fatigue. 

Wish fruits actions. sigh. need guns shoot virus. crazy scene  Well Biden m4a it’s changing soon. 

One big reasons thing cuz costs money go doctor employers often require note doctor sick day. It’s much gotta eat go anyway. think reasonable conclusion that, someone refuses sign written agreement, intention comply it.

No matter much bang *responsible* behaviour, point refusing sign signalled unwillingness *held responsible*.

Fair cop, say. Nah. five-year plans Internet. guess want copy paste will. history teacher taught class similar college testing would be. would lecture power point anything. 
Back high school 06. 
This honestly really helped get idea college would like. 

Also think teacher helped realize studying information learning learning memorizing information. important learn study studying. applied class. 

When got Uni, studying hour every day. honestly still procrastinated would study 10-15 hours night before. really tough classes, break down. 

I'm Florida honestly know what's going happen. idiot governor fine people wont wear Masks Trump probably pulling strings leaning not. Opening schools back even though top state US cases getting worse. 

Some good news though
The democratic nominees rising polls governor piss poor job thank god people recognizing it. wonderful news. Except Cuba successful country either. would take country EU Cuba day. 

If Cuba example successful Socialist country, going hard time selling ideals. I’m expert would think risk car accident 10+ hour drive probably higher risk getting infected flying. I’ve friends fly recently said flights almost empty. can’t imagine flight Philly Charleston would full begin with, even without pandemic. would vote flying. 

I would say biggest risk exposure friends. generally careful whole pandemic? specifically past two weeks? good news you’re mostly coming northeast things mild terms case numbers. 

I think good idea set testing maybe wait days rather day get home. you’re really worried, maybe self quarantine daughter wife get test results. maybe full quarantine wear mask you’re near try keep distance normal. 

Overall don’t think irresponsible maybe mindful friends keep distance, circulate air AirBnb (air conditioner on, open windows). general I’d spend much time outside possible. Watch hands, don’t touch face, social distance others public, etc. fun!  want safe sports watch, check Jelle's Marblelympics YouTube - amazingly high quality, real commentator, teams audience marbles rather people.

(#GoOceanics #TidePride) Schools going shitshow. 

Schools going even bigger shitshow. FTFY No. bf unemployed months due COVID can’t find another job. opinion opinion around poverty people face harm people COVID. friends (one doctor) thinks shutdown never happened economic ramifications know tests completely accurate, though? there's evidence article he's going counted covid-19 death. someone works people kids,  sh*t.


99% time get sick coworkers got kids got school. incoherent response. I've seen plans, results meetings held year.

China *plan* move communism within next 30 years, practical happening. also bearing *how actually join CCP

Joining CCP entirely different.

Why not, instead basically saying ""Google it"", ""ugh"", ""you're simplifying it"" ""your response coherent"", actually make proper comment form depth substance say capitalist society. Especially workers work company, dividends paid, workers company, prices set establishments, people accrue wealth.

Or version capitalism ""can lobby government"" far cases like still extremely rare research give conclusive evidence this. Could false positive many virus lead similar symptoms, people never develop antibodies virus, see happens New York coming months. it’s common lot reinfected cases New York soon. Governor’s news conference Friday. joke. war basing se people actually do. know woman moved TX Sandernista wants around progressives 24/7 even make baby sized face masks? shortened season begins Thursday, likely end weeks players start spreading amongst realize they're jeopardizing future seasons career force one happen.  whole point masks face shields protect people. masks might also provide protection wearer bonus. WTF need study info?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, masks work filter particles infectious disease go away magically. many teachers know? LOL don’t know they’d prove kid mom, unless separate person drop pick up. Either way, mom give 16 people amount exposure can’t safe around adult faculty staff! circular logic boggles mind know, TONS adults given school building! young, everyone's acting like exist. see people ages wearing masks, even hospital work at. make announcements everyday people keep masks on. would think place near 100% possibility run covid viral particles would care, no. blissfully ignorant. worst case scenario? vaccine years, containment best do.  even need full lockdown. Watch fucking easy it'll combat wear mask / shut gyms / curbside pick &amp; delivery / curfew highly populated areas. little common sense go long way this. late that? Maybe deadly yes - transmissible, no. Israel went almost cases full outbreak opened shit back without enough precautions. Shits scary. mean. Maybe years. bosses care, everyone sucking everyone them.  broke heart read reality people taking serious enough. still hear “it’s like flu, know people fine. blown proportion!” doesn’t apply COVID-19 deaths either. 

Everyone dying hospital nursing home right dying alone (at least areas) due restrictions visitation. doesn’t matter don’t coronavirus. They’re still dying alone. It’s horrifying. Maricopa Medical Examiner's office open M-F closed weekends. Reporting previous day. Sunday-Monday reported numbers low. Tuesday-Saturday numbers higher, open. thank you. New Englanders high opinion Cascadians. No, give 15 ""news"" platforms citing one singular flawed study misrepresents claim. absolute imbecile think coronavirus spread protests. Cash helps things get kinda bad. things get REALLY bad wish spent cash worth something. think so, no.

People basically seem divide acknowledge seriousness Covid, convinced even got it. say same. take account, schools closed would less contact children? 

Seems like adults working adults would likely contract it. children staying home, there'd less interactions contract spread it.  tested positive, would gone grandmother's house possibly infected her. CA, tried take kids walk around campus first week last year. hot, made 25 feet classroom. Half kids started crying drink, went realized one kid end line decided refuse stay classroom. like, normal August heat here. places snow September/October. mean personally would take grain salt we're learning new things virus everyday. Especially since since Nov anything study all. might seem like long time we're literally still learning new things SARS today.

I would advise everyone take whatever precautions due fact *we know* “We taking extra step recognize additional precautions needed protect country,” 

A quote ~~the White House~~ goddamn grocery store chain. here. catering benefits working (especially I'm leaving house going out).

Been since April. I'd love return work /find new job. fact sector provide security killed invisible threat. Seriously I've seen death count go 100 140,000 months. Well, mounting scientific evidence airborne sooooooo, yeah. Sadly, two required weekly labs Fall. beyond scared.... 

Wonder many students wear masks stand right other. Like u know feel like youre get colds? Youre throat sore etc could kinda stop continuing full blown colds? maybe means symptoms supressed idk. Im asking covid like too? Like u cant catch someone stop ur body infected. they'll say ""crisis actors."" yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* social well-being really matter parents dead. doubt healthcare workers great. making point wearing masks effects bunch groups too. Seeing indicators recessions coupled worlds worst response pandemic combined rising unemployment states forced shut back wave foreclosures evictions coming trillions handed corporations done fuck help situation gift graft stealing everything else saying, economy tanking paranoia. ""Looting phase"" crash keeping pumped like 2009. first link even say title says.

“...there’s limited evidence far children pass disease others significant numbers, according new report.”

That means limited evidence, surprising since article April. say children cannot pass it. 

From second link. 

“Although admitted children appeared less infectious adults, still little scientific data draw firm conclusions.”

Also evidence study single 9 yo kid. Also, taking kids ten. Don’t kids 11 go school too? Article also April. 

The last link 15 schools shows minimal, kids fact spread it. also bullshit didn’t address asymptomatic spread all. Many kids asymptomatic. 

Bottom line media terrible, people stupid kids 10 spread it. Also, one ever talk kids 10 go school. Many people also don’t talk teachers staff. Politics nothing response pandemic. G'ould friends Covid19 Wear damn mask.

This one reason think schools wait reopen. Small children irresponsible teens might wear masks properly times. Schools could become disease hubs. remember one child lice half class did.

Kids could, probably will, become super spreaders. chuckled, felt bad it. think they’ll actually listen tot teachers directives? Try explaining pandemic 5 year old. Agreed. anti-maskers focus talking points percentage people die, that's concern. people long-term effects long recoveries? astronomical medical bills? people can't get prompt treatment strokes, heart attacks, sepsis car crashes ICU full medical staff overwhelmed?

As yesterday, Texas Medical Center still baseline capacity 1,330 ICU beds, half beds use covid patients. idiot would say downstream effect. bungle fucktard chief demands incompetency already many different ways... NBA mouth swabs light nose swabs daily. Easier deny admit one wrong. Takes lot emotional intelligence admit one wrong, something republicans possess. Glad see traditional scapegoat people alive well, either deny existence virus, downplay severity blame blm protests. confounding me. guess theories children spreading disease would less adults? must people never children close proximity them. kids germs pits remember spending years er's kinds crap brought home school. truly understand world currently living hey - let's wear masks send kids back school!  True. believe Sunday Florida hit 15k day.  It’s beyond scary. father went may finally get released acute care center soon. Day #109 hospital. Recovery going long road Don’t count chickens hatch think it’s myopic privilege modern day special. start AIDS epidemic, couldn’t even use word “homosexual” newspaper. many media cultural hurdles seemingly insurmountable time yet people pushed back. Think it: political positions in, really want gay man 1978-1992?

The present always special problems, haven’t solved yet.

Social media isn’t tornado earthquake. isn’t forgone conclusion deal with. it’s bunch people organically finding other, FB, Twitter rest use social engineering casino-based addiction models hook people onto platforms. 

It’s Facebook giving people outlet, algorithm letting people find Suggestions notifications. read report day said Facebook auto-generates hate groups. problem isn’t people talking other, beliefs spotlighted amplified.

And drive - Twitter successfully drove ISIS, models. 

We need regulations platforms. need many solutions many problems, idea way willfully ignorant forces made Teachers abused system. discredit say society values childcare aspect school education. Teachers deserve better kids. pandemic made clear. 

When listing reasons schools need open education usually last thing mentioned mentioned all. confirm: used live MO. Many still see FL ""exotic"" worthwhile vacation destination. Okay actually read 5 year plans actually join CCP. get back incoherent response. Lol. president xi? haven’t spoken anyone who’s pissed pain disputing number, conclusion.

You're disputing number use number 1 day computation **and 7 day computation**, show **hospitalizations increasing**, dispute conclusion showcases headline wrong? Perfection Probably both. bio front, research suggests young kids (or much of) ACE2 nasal receptors needed catch virus. believe limited kids 10 under. effective given within first 1 (ONE) day initial infection.

seeing nobody knows infected first day, let alone confirmed testing, statement scores pretty high doubt-o-meter

that mean doubt part wasted. even doubt would run even wasted given USA contamination really need study something obvious? shit getting upvoted?  work home. video conferences. Less physical offices.

The US likely start manufacturing items.

More investment vaccines. Mate, I’m UK. Spare condescension. I’m mate. It’s pretty unlikely either roommate would’ve contracted scenario testing readily available anyone might well go get one Oh sue slips. want us holding anyone responsible careless covid agree it’s spread.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's gonna whole lot open schools, mention teachers die.

We simply cannot open schools. 


The people government botching decisions everyday make covid cases soar need held accountable. dont mean vote out, mean impeach them, remove office, arrest them.


Children people arent sacrifices billionaire friends.

Corrupt piece shit idiot politicians.  week, started consider getting flu shot first time, using logic. Getting covid weakened flu major increase mortality risk. Also, choose assume chance contracting Covid higher weakened flu.  keep telling people don’t take seriously neighborhood.

Like don’t remember 19 years ago suddenly felt moved country’s pain put little US flags sticking truck windows? earth disaster feel less important one? understand ever doubt. like common sense went window somewhere January Isn’t exactly you’re doing? think certain lines even propoganda can't contain fair democratic system. (a little nervous last part true)

Fox News cherry picked opinionated bs ever, lot grounded cherry picked truth. work ton right leaning folks working industrials know many (if all) made jump fox OAN/info wars. Breitbart bad bad two. used enjoy encouraged introvert life style already had, shit's actually gone ahead hit fan, want done pleasee gene makes taste cilantro soap. Fyi, cilantro666. Cant wait take half assed vaccine rushed save Trump's negligence make pharma companies billions. Forget years normally takes rule adverse effects, way convenient  teach freshmen we'll see! still better option person. actually worry seniors most, since really hard get motivated. says 3-5 paper gave me, website says 5-7 days. Apparently they’re backlogged. would really unusual get flu, haven’t 9 years I’m always careful haven’t around anyone much cold :( I’m really hoping results tomorrow. Yeah moron so... y'know Yup. Fingers get pointed “unsavory” minorities times like this. 1300s, lead horrible purges. STOP REPOSTING THIS. Seriously. almost two weeks now. every couple days gets posted. He's dead. weeks now. let ffs. Please Oxford... come on. this. End hellhole pandemic all.  also show immune response - pretty clear safety issues  I'm calling now. change issue demanding money instead real response pandemic government.

You telling president cares tonight's poll numbers money issue. far concerned go back work solve problem, fed kicker looking renewed.

This like dealing slow child literal petulant teenager executing instructions literal manner something wrong purpose.

If money issue, get back work. virus issue, demand addressed necessarily include relief funds individuals. hasn’t mass production started now? entrepreneurs mask makers times? would expected slow items milk influx front them. Oh   also saying getting necessary relief either. bc they're effected more, I'm denying it, mean they've getting nothing. directly giving help people based skin color. racist af? Bc Kap? gives shit? panicking going crazy February. meh, another day plague.  Cubans aren’t really starving anymore. Sure Cuba still struggles it’s much better 90s. Due American embargo Cuba’s economy far reliant Soviet aid collapse USSR hit pretty hard. 

Luckily managed pivot tourism Cuba much better shape North Korea (another Soviet ally hit hard collapse). Overall Cuba’s life expectancy similar United States, pretty damn impressive small island nation that’s US embargo half century. best solution inject bleach body. virus die seconds too. pandemic end soon trumpeteers inject Dump recommended 'Korona Killer Koolaid'. I'm right you. I'm getting really scared mental stability get better. keep trying downplay big fucking deal. Texas locked ago fact crime humanity. Yup...it sucks...I work what's left aviation industry...so many people state... traveling Florida...many ""You live once"" ""The tickets cheap"". Families small children, elderly...you name it...I'm shocked still happening.

I surprised asshats come back COVID cases state...suddenly spike. Salvation Army coming next don’t see incoming HS freshmen even sophomores well wit at-home-only options. That's goal, likely happen.

Why? China's CPC stated goal clearly seem work toward it.

Socialism process CPC believes working towards system built viewed necessary Wealth accrued

[Personal accumulation happens even USSR millionaires. goal eliminate private accumulation.

China claim already built socialism, claim building socialism first major target modern socialist market economy without poverty 2050. COVID killed wasn’t healthy What😂 Neil Breen could find us vaccine godlike powers rid world corporate political corruption time. right it’s guaranteed still vaccine. think it’s going work, that’s quite another thing. Totally agree. I'm lucky live somewhere board thoughtful teachers chose fully online start year. sad teachers states idiot governors parents. LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


*ahem* Excuse me.

This great news. evil. It’s not, go ahead believing whatever makes feel better. sound like bad way go compared many cases. would virus onset infection mask suggestion local authorities said, 'thanks, thanks'. interesting see policies enforced. plenty reports violence, deadly, refusing wear mask.

Most stores seem loss prevention employees take hands approach dealing customers. don’t feel sorry Tenure? Ha! Tenure hardly exists professors. adjuncts (temporary, at-will workers)now k-12 teachers tenure. agree teachers across country strike. schools reopen see teachers children dying, maybe changes made. Would feel safe standing line narrow corridor 30+ minutes directly front someone covid-19? garbage opinion.  timeline:  virus killed UV light. hates outdoor summer weather. 

It *loves* people together, indoors, air conditioning. Well states locked immediately got hit hardest no? least highest death rates. (New York, NJ, PA) states pro-lockdown beginning seemingly dodged it, seeing spiking death rates like Cali. Cali never came lockdown it’s spiking there. even know right solutions are? generalizing? see situation truly lord's work. genuinely think we're arguing thing...just semantics? wanna go diving Costa Rica rn. Gimme shot oxford leggggooooo I've already bought concert tickets show April. I've obviously got confidence lol I'm one religious people :)  would say no, Italy least, maybe less dangerous n US, moment, def safe. However, say seen big gatherings here, everything open number people regulated. Many people bit sloppy masks often wear noses stuff, overall seems like making effort. Agree, also feel stupid, least chance educate. Defiance - fugetaboutit. American banned many countries including whole Europe due incompetent handling virus. relate.   hear people keep saying think necessarily true. Oxford frequently news much Moderna. Moderna seemed actually low-key news comparison. However, [recently released Phase 1 peer-reviewed fact one current vaccine producers (before Oxford tomorrow) that's I'd say hearing more. 
  
Though yes, American company help, EDIT: regards American news excuse, science works. can’t expect people perfect, expect people admit wrong new evidence comes out, Fauci did. Trump incapable repeatedly doubled wrong. American people continue trust Fauci Trump huge margin, Fauci doesn’t bullshit us. Trump does. lot hype keep mind results vaccines really released yet, hype still alive. results tomorrow rumoured good news.  I've got coins saved. giving award lol Fuck em. show must go on. need money. people need sports. get it, get it. /s huge If.  thought winning?  hope come back mock wrong months lol. Even us plebs can't get right away, still means others that's start stops droplets hitting face eyes. I'm understanding that's ""almost nothing"" given know virus typically spread. Omg need feel barbers hands again! It’s long lol learned cut hair, even learned buff file nails finally it’s time get pampered 😂 fucking shit. needed study determine this? Badly Yeah. Sending sick people nursing homes refusing contact trace protestors model follow. 

At beginning pandemic, lot respect Fauci. point, lost respect. joke. think Futures good indicator. market gonna know what’s coming do. 

-	Good news: Market 300+
-	Standard “nothing new” news: Flat
-	Bad news: Market 300+ reason worked great depression entirely economically driven.

This one caused external event, makes quite different.

We need get things control. requires staying home. requires money.

People saying need money rather saying need virus addressed driving push force people back work cutting federal UI kicker. president idiot cannot think past tonight's polling results. means literal specific demand.

If money issue, get back work longer issue, right? Obviously not. demands comprehensive response, money. I’ve seen story 20 times arguing children haven’t much adults aren’t going transmit much? 

Because studies schools child care centers kids mixing without parents conducted point children transmitting much adults. course need data data across world similar results. severity virus blown proportion..? Fucking democrats everything hide fact contributed community spread know you’re talking ass things require actual thought study understand US could crushed much less 2 trillion dollars spent temporarily propping economy. I’m assuming it’s going go healthcare workers elderly first? many parts utter shit, like healthcare system. think we're kinda making point here. That’s england lol best bud going airnb August cancelled owners shut down, new rules California 🙁 Don’t give em ideas mate. This’ll end conspiracy subreddit lol Yes! We’ll able see friends family omg I’m like you! Treating myself! I’m overdue haircut! :) 🤞🏻  course. trade year round decent wages work seasonal. I'm outside Seattle love here. Housing completely realm people's reality. becoming new San Francisco quickly. first point irrelevant. isnt Trump talking about. talking per capita, we? No. brought yourself. hard country 1 million testing citizens, 1 million people deal with. 

Stop disingenuous. Go away. I’m disappointed Kane. Yea it’s really impressive little creepy handle issues. plain clothes security throughout park soon something occurs employees form human line isolate block view problem guests handle it. Where’s spike NYC Boston? Far protesters FL TX, yet spike. Millions people eaten inside restaurant drank inside bar protested protested outside. people even want eat inside restaurant pandemic? Disgusting. Looks like refrigeration trucks might great investment foreseeable future. MAGA. Yes, mis-typed used infection. 

And really Florida variety tests uses one would assume would use alternative, less brain tickling one, Littles. know squirmy are. joke tragedy. hubris power. Article blocked EU. I've debating original point, specifically line. put forward kind absolute, something ""is"" must also admit ask people social also unhealthy.

And I'm saying that's bullshit, argument pushed explain people selfish compared large part world. One used people excuse they're fucking everyone else over.

So guess I'm saying 3 months tough you, buckle seatbelt, thanks folks (thank far though. really mean that), going keep going many months.

It could almost now. unfortunately isn't. Every single person puts social needs greater good forcing everyone else isolate longer. that's insanely fucked up.  know asymptomatic? Oh sure could. think us far couple weeks, least NE. like button Reddit. 

/s  I’m US centric I’m US we’re terribly. countries surprisingly well, even Chinas economy growing right now.

I honestly don’t think vaccine effective. never found target sars coronaviruses, vaccine produce associated increased mortality. also comes logistics immunizing 7 billion people every three months. us doesn’t money masks, vaccine made lead war global instability countries fight it. 

Bottom line people need change behavior stop waiting vaccine may never come. love living state people avoid winter (Minnesota). Keeps affordable! feel like deep lot people *are* scared know cope reality all. Haha nope. Mother passed, family 3 covid positive, 4 friends/colleagues hospital 12 positives monitoring oxigen every hour.
Are ok? insert cute puppies hugging gif Never heard Statesman source. site? Seriously. human? Yeah? Well think capable spreading human disease. Nevermind normally, younger kids sicker parent always is. Situation HK tricky, given political tensions. pro-democracy guys ignore social distancing rules time blame HK government outbreak. 
The central government already sent teams Xinjiang recent outbreak. sending medical teams HK? Someone cry lost democracy &amp; freedom coz may trace you/ use DNA... doomscrolling — days called ‘reading news staying current’ Two students came school sick fevers March last day school person. One said hurt breathed. sent home immediately, angry parents let come school beginning pandemic everyone knew likely schools would closed next week. Water ain’t wet. right everywhere else mountains too. Check yourself. that's important **have** work food poisoning? realize managers supposed calling people right? never played shit. I'm sick, I'm out. see real online learning saw emergency plan learning. Online learning could amazing school spent summer planning instead shooting person hope outbreak part northeast? Vermont weirdly getting higher summer temps Massachusetts year, high today 94. ecause left side age curve low. flu, get spike kids spike seniors. Corona that. notice that, according article, elementary age children spread it.
Here's article goes deeper certainly far consider shut-it-down-at-all-costs crowd considering. detectable imply: catch virus. make statement it.

I'm mostly saying: Cool study. clarify safe not. ignore. Yes, one. good thing do, I’m really worried algorithms aggressive this. YouTube example, can’t mention Covid-19 without deplatformed. Like chess channel saying tournaments cancelled COVID-19 finance channel discussing COVID-19 impact economy.

Wholesale shutting discussion may contribute idiots thinking COVID-19 overblown hoax. impression wearing masks prevent getting infected rather helped spreading it? sounds like crazy, controversial idea imagine many parents struggling get many students would incentivized work harder help Mommy &amp; Daddy. US 3rd world country called mother, (who almost died COVID like 2 months ago), yesterday. FL resident, dumb result Fox News blasting 24/7 house. stupidity transferred siblings too.

She shopping sister 2 year old nephew upscale chic boutique store clothes like nothing happening.

I guess I'm trying say US fucked. say? Next be....""Study: Sneezing directly someones face high probability spreading virus""

Edit: word What’s next? Adults spread coronavirus effectively old people? That's links say. say lower levels cells severe cases COVID-19, likely due body's response virus rather virus ""attacking"" Taken together, conclude cells decreased exhausted patients COVID-19. Cytokines IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α might involved cell reduction.

It's extremely irresponsible go around telling people virus attacks cells. blatant misinformation. looking worldometer NY peaked 10k cases per day 1k deaths. Florida gonna way worse, right? Europe intelligent leadership care citizens.

We have, well, have, umm... Seems like would need different (mutated) variant reinfect someone quickly though. CDC awful website, can't fact check things without wanting rip hair trying understand fuck they're trying say get sick become bankrupt like How's weather? wonder screwed NFL go forward ill advised season star player two catches passes away. Or, imagine Patrick Mahomes caught it, survived, one unlucky people permanent lung damage. NFL would see bright young superstar retire, owners desperate keep cash cow going. He’s going rage quit election starts go badly. mitigations taken reopened schools? Thats exactly need information. need explain kids school spread everything else like wild fire this. read something earlier kids shed much load adults, that’s probably it. ""oNlY 89 dEaThS?"" worse tens millions people would access.

So would rather **all** Americans access type care? make sense? American get enjoy something unless Americans get enjoy well? this? Communist China? people get small fraction care need. 

And would prefer people get *none* care need? get feeling someone “good insurance.”

I rich multi-billionaire. millions Americans like good insurance luck **as well as** making good life choices. embarrassed Typical American attitude: “well would covered cares anyone else.” wonder America shithole.

Typical communist attitude: ""well covered cares do"". wonder communist countries shithole countries. awful. sad. feel terrible family. even asking, yeah. Ya need get test. Florida.  e use Bing?

For fucks sake dude. source shows COVID cases spiked protests go ahead link them. don't, happen.

Besides, news articles besides point. use none them, long link reported numbers. Numbers numbers, even reported CNN. living hope don’t get serious illness wipe savings person replied to, agree him, despite poor delivery. 

I’m lucky enough savings job work home; employer tried force dangerous situation family I’d quit. 

Think long term. Losing job would financial burden, would falling ill. Anyone live Vermont? district announced kids go either Monday/Wednesday Tuesday/Thursday, every Friday. kids get smaller classes spacing, poor teachers still asked work building every single day. don’t see work. trying argue can't compare Sweden's response New York's response (while constantly acting smart insulting others). user saying believes Sweden's response better, keep arguing can't compare two.

Well, even can't want compare two. Even can't prove Sweden's method would worked better NY. 

You able admit NY's decision place people nursing homes bad one. say Sweden's would better worse, well maybe little better. Europe phreedum h8ing evil socialists. America phreedum luving p8triot /s  Also ITT: People clearly read article. Every business think AC, schools don't. Vermont lot households still AC (including mom) need every day summer. two window units I'm second-floor apartment like comfortable, handful days summer (today one them) AC would unbearable. Comfortable lies don’t fuck stock market certain segment America looks judge success.  think slaps sticker packages too?

No, saves exciting privilege bigger donors. get pack boxes, slap labels, get big ""thumbs up"" photo Donald. Masks, course, optional. always cloth surgical valved n95. N95 protects me, cloth valve protects you, want dick. immune system amped fighting current virus likely gonna clobber new invader.

Macrophages, neutrophils immune cells necessarily virus specific numbers increase infection. Sort like song, ""This ole house"". What? People spread disease easily people? Yay science. takes bit training awareness use half-face respirator correctly pathogens. idea wear it, protect head neck straps putting hood it. time remove it, remove grabbing head neck straps only. bit job correctly disinfect filters mask without contaminating yourselves. Also, one need also learn correct procedure wash mask soap disinfect bleach.

That say impossible teach people it. possible, seems lot people listen many places, authorities take ""we can't it"" approach. country plagued anti-Vaxers? people care themselves. expect care others? toes.... 3 toes turn sheet white little 60 days in. rash 50 days in. Singapore getting ""massacred"" it? They've 27 deaths. death rate Covid US *100 times* death rate Singapore love going restaurants particular brewpubs. fan cooking every meal myself.

I even less fan catching novel coronavirus.

I've sucked prepared every meal since March. end goal resume enjoying going restaurants brewpubs whenever damn thing finally over. unfortunate... nobody deal losing kid this. cannot open schools. cannot. need this. Peaceful protest might well make feel better. feel like finally able shout feelings thoughts etc. change many minds, unfortunately. seriously doubt effect change, nation. incredible job unifying country complying lockdown orders That's oddly specific paper request obviously going exist yet. idiot asking research papers peer reviewer info even available long enough papers written peer reviewed. know takes time. papers available eventually. basically asking tell game ends clock hit zero score 100 1. outcome uncertain numbers telling story seems really bother far. argue researchers scientists looking numbers disparity one dumbest points hanging hat on. course they're interested numbers put weight behind them. Muh freedomz need clairvoyant see shit coming. went Yosemite holiday weekend. Probably 60-70% people wearing masks. 

We even wore masks Mist Trail, gets pretty strenuous certain points, like 500ft narrow switchbacks. Everyone heavily huffing puffing I’m glad masks. Would interesting see people wearing masks half dome considering busy get. parent sent kid school ziplock back puke in. told hide backpack tell us sick. five course showed us puke filled bag like prized possession. 

Another student hurt needed picked go urgent care, wasn’t bad enough ambulance. parents wouldn’t come. grandfather drove 3 hours away come get take her. 

It’s societal problem parents don’t adequate leave schools childcare centers. Usually it’s whatever time it’s going get people killed lifelong consequences. teach kindergarten I’m legitimately scared go full time school proposing. Mind stated get baby wipes clean janitors clean end day kids gone. kid coughing sneezing class surfaces won’t cleaned hours later. mid sized Florida county (with less 1 million residents) reported 500 new cases today. Religion created foundation comforting lies. statement Sunday, authorities urged people living Figueres Vilafant, province Girona, Sant Feliu de Llobregat, near Barcelona, stay home except essential latest figures Catalonia’s regional health ministry Saturday showed daily increase 1,226 cases. true. one weird lies told beginning pandemic seems still alive. :( think masks get covid opposed face shield? Yeah, best one I'm sorry. appears many people want learn hard way virus.  surprised here. amazes maskholes (assholes won’t wear mask) think can’t catch spread others. SC friend, private school teacher children, told afraid optics put children back daycare since paid essentially put others children risk school. 

Gotta love logic. premier league major footy leagues managed far. respective countries also botch response pandemic. Sucks, right? Sorry I'm Republican want dead. us happy response admin voting again. wouldn’t able to. Lol Objects. even words this? question, realistic think go years without catching covid 19 without vaccine?. Sure could chance vaccine reaction know people get covid experienced long term health effects. Reading list people actually experienced scarier possible ""what ifs"" vaccine. Please Oxford, believe you, miss friends one worried vaccine mass produced distributed thats rushed since day 1? effects years road? I'm way anti vaxer right makes nervous. wanna date rebuild confidence reads like total strawman, say someone loves staying home, kids, date. want everyone else live way do? Hell no! works ME, understand unusual one, want everyone able go parties, bars, dinners crowded restaurants, movies, on. say absolutely favor *persistent* cultural shift towards mask wearing get virus control, matter means vaccine, virus naturally mutating become insignificant, whatever. want ""new normal"" though, also believe rush reopen far harmful. could agree wear masks responsible, even takes government mandates, would much better would even closer normal quite now.

Bottom line: love life, want force you, think persistent change virus dealt needed, definitely rushed reopening permanent culture change. “Sizable populations” unwilling comply. vocal minority. That’s all. hate headline article promising. based fukking reality Pollyanna wishful thinking?? live rock?! non-stop news stories every little update every single vaccine candidate. So, trust Trump? Wow! Hes died again?  read article family area. read article want informed opinion. You’re going make loved ones cry well light prick. Wtf? Here’s hint: check sources. 

Scientists measured language comes drug trial success trials, design, require substantial follow understand efficacy protection CUT ONION?! ""Are rich? considered important? connected right people? Welllllll step right get vaccine right away!"" U.S. continue issue supply chain.

The U.S. election can't come fast enough. border, Covid-denial propaganda, massive amount supplies needed treat increasing infections, Trump rest American conservatives serious threat Canada right now. work mask ambassadors stores restaurants? would love nothing see chevy charlie seaman regarding masks walmart Damn, booked far? Guess ton people coming shit mental health. (Anxiety gang checking in) Honestly, avoided mentioned places since March. go absolutely choice, places I've good employees wear masks asking guests same. places even refused service guests comply, citing safety employees.

That gets tricky area businesses lead incidents like happened Wal*Mart unmasked gunman, Waffle House employees getting shot refusing let man wearing mask, etc.

In part MS, locals masking *if* going places. probably see wearing walking someplace town, though. problematic traveling groups. NONE tourists coming wearing (probably even aware county mandate stating need worn). mess. cases continued decline social distancing reduced. think happened?  Corona kill *everyone*. come point hyper-vigilant ones left. can't sure much avoidable suffering must happen get point, though. mean, people compelled take vaccine, yes. 

That said, actually understand concern within US case. There's much politically driven urgency find silver bullet US actually rather easy believe might push unsafe vaccine us order place November elections - all, hawking hydroxychloroquine long evidence dangerous helpful, say nothing even crazier ""solutions"" they've tried push. Personally, I'll watching neutral 3rd parties information (i.e. Europe approaching it?) get vaccine available I'm convinced rushed US authorities. Yes. I’m you. We’re planning trying baby soon rush get vaccine. There’s telling long term effects could have, including effects fertility. I’m otherwise provax would 100% get weren’t planning getting pregnant soon. Sounds super sketchy

""Quebec health authorities initially provide explanation changed methodology new surge.

But later Friday, health officials said previously listed people longer hospital recovered."" sailor. Still willing kiss nurses, though. 😉 Yet people want wear mask whatever needs done slow spread too. There's another component here. Kids families. families get infected. Rates infection community skyrocket. Economy shuts again.

Doing anything spread virus even less risky kids foolish. think infection kids stays kids magically? Nothing, antidote said another comment there's lot immunity antibodies. player team increases chances contact passes Covid-19. 

The lock approach NBA least risky. 

Baseball larger roster travel much dangerous. 50 - 50 chance least one team drop due number covid cases.

Football even larger roster travel seem viable, much close contact many individuals. concur household finances puts strain relationships.

I remember reading marriages male unemployed 33% likely result divorce: 

Given increase unemployment rates since beginning pandemic, think increase divorces resulting unemployment inevitable. No, evaluate risk understand math.

I’m sure dying alcoholic-induced liver failure bad way go, still drink alcohol. manage risk consuming believe excessive amount alcohol.

 obsessed reducing risk near zero possible everything bad life. reason drive cars less 5* safety rating, fly airplanes, etc. Nouns, really. miss nouns. Well, crimes created material circumstances. Petty crime least.

If youre starving dont really think probation much bread.


Anyways isnt punishment, risk, similar also meaningfully different.   So, going go visit sniffles people hospital? Sniffles. ass. I'm sure people died sniffles. even say loud? Oh bad lol Hey kind tracking we're generally aware reminds happened last week. Friend called ask generator fam had, txted Dad answer (didnt look up) said ""Yeah, Kohler"" friend. it.

Nah, need loopholes mask stay nose. yeah, inflation *should* thing.  nothing makes sense right financial world world would already done continue threaten. saying 3 weeks taking action.

Downplaying sniffles disingenuous pretending airborne version AIDs. And, views shit memory died, suffer greatly it, eventually fall two categories.

It's novel coronavirus that, even according medical chief UK, Chris Whitty, ""most people even got, majority asymptomatic mostly, get quite bad illness, even smaller number need hospitalisations, even smaller still die"". respect damage do, without becoming hyperbolic went social drinker full blown alcoholic couple months there. control now, know keep way lasts much longer pointing page.

Why allowed that? going see large amount passing saying haven’t really learned much work easy get done.

That often true pandemic, though. Ah, know that! I've mentioned, Disney World decade Tokyo Disney seem much way security last went (but could easily invisible contingent never really deployed visiting). Spreading disease definitely unsavory. feeling 'unsavory' code something else, since applied super spreader events bars, churches workplaces. Make make sense. understand none it. Humans lives matter know decent troll, I'll give that. Take care. 😂 Hi Karen Antibodies meant last longer. tcells memory cells kinds neat immune system functions play role long term immunity ever wear canadian flag unironically please shoot me. real yet? do, stopped minting mean, that’s little dramatic get it. Definitely American thing. think it’s thing Japan Asian countries people sick willingly wear mask public (pre-covid). Logically, implies scientific evidence not, not, sufficient support argument ""face masks matter"".

Because otherwise fact body evidence growing would bear upon argument. Except articel ALSO but: Researchers traced children felt sick. transmission rates asymptomatic cases remains unknown, children less likely adults develop symptoms.

In words, 

1) done contact tracing. 

2) trace young children much. 

That may explain difference. shows older children spread like adults. show younger children don't. 

And btw, even huge limitations finding younger children (because tracing much), STILL found plenty spread younger children. politicians seem hardly notice happening. I’m going kick teeth and/or get kicked in

And saying going get teeth kicked in. going shot. Dead. America, Canada Europe Asia. Hill built bodies 140k americans comparable. 100 cases Holland yesterday. many individual counties daily cases that. Man, lack personal accountability that... I'm sorry. Interesting way look it. true many states, larger entire European countries. Easy lose perspective spending $600 per week? can't spend money get. Politics carried point causing death called *warfare*.

Trump actively engaging warfare American people. He’s order affect political gains.

That means actions nothing short terrorism. That’s hyperbole. definitions. 

Terrorism means biological warfare.

If makes people feel uncomfortable point want reject it, that’s cognitive dissonance action.

We need come terms first. accept it, comes time taking legal action protect nation. Also, almost presents even New York going difficult time incredibly comforting me. looked forward daily briefings, handle things, plan, experts deferred, felt like given s*** situation, least there's somebody help make less s*****.

I'm pretty liberal politically, would naturally take someone like Larry Hogan Maryland, also felt like really good especially first three months emergency. firmly believe dragged Democratic governor along tandem Muriel Bowser Washington DC. There's really point Virginia DC Maryland different policies practices substantively speaking, given we're like one large highly populated area.

I'm less thrilled moment however, they've got real unemployment benefits issue state Maryland that's addressed. I've got friends put work live Maryland waiting month half unemployment benefits risk right losing homes it. I'd like Hogan refocus address issues starts pumping 2024 presidential run. use markets advance economy enough enact communism. doesn’t mean “hybrid” system. you’d like discuss theory, please feel free DM me. know yet trend reversal. know ""the number hospitalized patients confirmed suspect Covid-19 ~~has stopped rising~~"" **is higher yesterday 7 day trend**. Thus, asserted, headline wrong. Hard say really. saying outbreaks connected BLM protests. thousands shoulder shoulder outside amongst general subversion. Yuri Bezmenov, KGB defector, warned us back 1980’s today’s reality. listen:  7-10 days exposure, symptoms appear someone that’s negative. Hopefully wasn’t next people, usually outside social distance enough keep virus away guarantees. Give months. Fed said they'll keep inflating bubbles. only...but want robotic dick malfunction literally rip vagina abdomen. think previous study younger children showing didn't. Hahahahahha. Funny sad time. Well observations looking data specifically Florida's department health (cases deaths age), also CDC's data USA. recognize I'm researcher, database scientist, I'm seeing results others are. addition, I've also read reports Germany, also Israel (who opposite findings Germany note reports parents infected children bene social distancing well). encouraged research come conclusions. avoid confirmation bias. wife teacher, sake, families children, want us get right. say thing parents though Absolutely not. father-in-law died exactly way. family sad him, absolutely lacks enough empathy put situation. ""Oh, underlying conditions""....

People suck. clearly PewDiePie's fault, like last time. /s wonder hotel workers issued surgical masks? Even though N95 filtration level, surgical masks provide substantial barrier respiratory droplets compared standard cloth masks.  wrong shopping Walmart? policy requiring masks, responsible thing times pandemic. that, Walmart also stepping letting carparks Walmart stores used testing sites, among things. bad reputation among certain voting blocks, pandemic demonstrated, comes helping America, Walmart certainly stepped up. encouraging companies behave like Walmart. Sorry, forgot include source original post, edited one in. Here's link CDC well, nice read  So, like condoms basically. Poor child, poor family. unimaginable tragedy.

We don’t know typical COVID symptoms adult let alone child, 100% COVID symptom list.

What know 20-30% pcr based COVID tests return false negative. type test had.

Given currently exactly one highly contagious deadly disease common circulation frequently cause otherwise healthy young people dropping dead apparent reason - whole case screams COVID me.

Letting public know happened 100% journalism. baseless fear mongering here. Name city. feel like headlines like “BREAKING NEWS: die, turns out, DEAD! 11.” It’s like, lying that? What’s point put lipstick dead bloated pig? *creemee Humans richly deserve extinction. competent government would closed wet markets study study warned alarming number coronaviruses cultivated them. school let kids retake tests sick? make difficult way? following here. subbed several years many districts one State never saw school teacher make trouble student sick missed test-- fact schools policy required retakes available end term. school's policy?

And point sick always inconvenient schools cannot fix that. work school none attendance awards bends backwards accommodate kids missed day, said makes difference, still kids fevers coughs room regular basis, even kids faint vomit see end school day still nurse's office one come pick up. agree. rising senior wish much could actual school year prom pep rallies, i'd rather little social interaction instead seeing one friends get sick die Watchmen good. Damn.  they've keeping hurricanes quiet chuck deaths COVID?

I proof, nobody except democrats would able pull off. attempt harm Trumps reelection course. /s people somehow believe Donald Trump self made man. Hard catch virus head buried deeply sand Masters degree could good route unable teach right anyway.

And yeah, math tricky subject teach online, think definitely doable captivating personality fun examples base lessons on. Since went teaching passion money I'm confident she'd able make successful channel =) Duh Go spam somewhere else really second wave? thought Spanish flu's second wave happened next year. third wave. Yikes.

It’s inconclusive way strep swab be. don’t get good enough contact come negative. test sticks 6” q-tip nose scraps material feels like brain often causing bleeding. It’s painful, it’s uncommon don’t get enough material test positive testing twice isn’t question. like 6 year old take strep swab twice There’s small /r/unexpectedstartrek 

There’s also meme Star Trek subs /r/risa /r/startrekmemes Florida also 6,000 pneumonia flu deaths year, anomaly shatters previous annual averages state. 

A states also records unusually high flu pneumonia deaths year. 

As many experts stated, including Fauci, provisional number deaths undercount. CDC likely readjust numbers ends. ...you know dont stop infected suppress symptoms like suggesting here. Symptoms, even mild, result infection. warning sign. JFK Jr sharpest knife drawer either  Hypothetical:

President Trump stands front banquet hall full supporters, holds big glass liquid waste, freshly scooped nearby ""hog lagoon,"" tells everyone room, *""This magical elixir give everyone 100% immunity COVID-19. Also, happen cancer growing body, magical elixir kill cancer cells. Everyone drink watch!""*

Every single person room would gleefully drink big glass liquid pig shit, saying taste minor, momentary inconvenience.

Any resulting illnesses deaths would blamed media. Minnesota here, wanna Canadians plz bring good point money expediting actual synthesis, production, distribution vaccines, talking terms longitudinal follow-up studies track outcomes test subjects.

All money world can't guarantee vaccine less year testing effective safe one years, possibly decades, testing. Ugh. all. don’t believe you’ve read 5 year plans wouldn’t saying did. 

China trying advance economy enough enact communism means inherent contradictions system grows. 

If actually read five-year plans would know that.

They planned economy execute business owners exploit workers, America should. 

If fail adhere five year plans, change mind. Xi Jingping far following them. 

Apparently know join CCP pass test Marxism-Leninism. 

Are communist not? interest educating capitalists you’re comrade feel free DM get deep theory. think so. since much comment history, ""I see pictures bodies covid concern"" safe say lot ignorant people spewing bullshit.  America Norway. Average height 6ft funny. closer 5'6"". Oh please.

Josephine County (sorry use example again, center stupid seems there) voted multiple times raising taxes provide basic government services police fire. gummint bad taxes ebil. tell one goddamned nickel tax money Portland go services people shown time time they're fucking cheap pony cent services own? please tell taxes fucking high. live Multnomah county. know high property taxes are. pay them. Taxes cover charge civilized society. want pay them, whine kids getting meth Christmas stocking. bad person 99% survive means three million dead Americans catch it.

Also second wave spanish flu worse. Floridian here. “no symptoms” testing occasion. think two separate days last 10 days county. Usually, need either doctor’s note saying you’re exhibiting symptoms confirmed contact someone tested positive. point would settle making America shithole. Yes. religious people staying home, wearing masks go out, going services via Zoom, praying effective vaccine soon. don’t get covered media, we’re home time. #Kewwwllllll Yup, New England Republicans different form rest country. They're like fiscal moderates, they're pro-choice pro-LGBTQ+ rights. see thing going window? immunity! First thing thought of: ever think couldn't? neurological symptoms still experiencing?

Muscle pain loss smell taste?

I lost smell taste kid following viral infection took years come back. Note said hybrid, said accurate say China capitalist economy. wording deliberate.

Yes state plays huge role economy, unlike anything see countries view capitalist general matter. private sector represents 70-80% GDP, accounts 80% urban employment 90% new jobs. 

Most financial institutions state-owned, government largest lever economy general matter. said, largely managed promote growth supported market-oriented economy economy / 5yr plan reflect reality happening China's economy... again, 90% new jobs private sector. sound stupid. try estimating Covid19 prevalence gutting reading ducks entrails? hard? Romans 2000 years ago.

/Sarcasm.  way things change people start punished failure keep communities safe. can't even California, Florida stand chance. feel sorry people live neighborhood watched windows helpless terror. Western, eastern - matter. cars. Japan cars less good American European ones. let's look AvtoVAZ products, ..?

Btw, love asking people proof scientific evidence much. bring least one support position? far, see huge flow subjective information you. observed younger children appear spread readily adults.

If that's true, pretty amazing. parent kids toddler age up, knows kids walking germ factories, bring infections home parents ever face anywhere else.

I google this, evidence could find support claim young kids spread covid, examinations data schools. One found 9 infected students, infection spread. Yet study also showed 9 infected school staff school, time, infection spread.

Another study used fact infected children infected parents 60 percent time, healthy children infected parents 7 percent time. somehow ""proves"" infected kids infected parents? 

This sounds like another case sketchy data pushed flesh narrative. Like mask deniers constantly claiming ""no scientific proof"" mask wearing public would reduce spread covid. marginally true, simply covid new, science time controlled experiments would considered actual scientific proof covid spreading would controlled masks. science already knew masks reduce respiratory infection spread viruses. covid specific studies show masks effective.

Kids walking petri dishes, bring home infection going around. Every experienced parent frikkin world knows that. parents may unaware single infant toddler keep kid home time. little ankle biters hit day care Kindergarten, parents real treat. Thank you. People need get reality check actually actively try get people take seriously Unbased way explained masks filters aren’t rated stop particles size actual virus cell, however; virus cells transmitted spit mucus coughed up. mask really stop droplets expelled, much larger virus itself. Agreed. know state union (PSEA) fighting us, it’s getting scarier scarier closer get first day school. 

Our governor put regulations effect groups bigger 25 indoors. Yet, bringing 2,000 students, faculty staff back one single school building one sees issue it? tell gasoline hoax perpetrated big oil shouldn’t fill gas tank, since cars run using perpetual motion engine.   That’s said worry get trouble. I’m saying I’m going people tell put mask. I’m saying see someone physically assaulting old lady I’m going kick teeth and/or get kicked goes way. couldn’t sit nothing. Fucking gross Wish Americans understood saying “an oz prevention worth lb pound cure” still yell takin seriously wear seat belts drive. remember resistance seat belts people still cut cord wear belt. loss.

Glad see big box stores take stand require masks; government ""get it.""

As alternative masks face shields. wear face shield. I'm arguing can't compare outcomes understand approach would lead lower death toll. simple argument anyone basic understanding causal inference would get.

I never said New York's death toll lower placed infected people nursing homes.

Now, maybe New York adopted Swedish approach start, death toll would lower currently is. sincerely doubt that.  That's good point. Metrics clear, ignored frequently.

Tbh give crap coming late WFH soon job done. treat like professionals giving flexibility help better can. senior delivers half code intern, code mistakes, well... bad.

In first case, pissed childish behaviour. understand come something like 'dude, uni friends got toasted. I'm ded'. lying sick mother...And also posting party social media, HR asking one covering it.
But code delivered due date ok-ish.

Second third cases: work done. also including issues, like delivering old code new, lying saying shit another department. childish behaviour bad results.

I'd say workload doable team overstaffed, manager decided keep nice relaxed. point people reaching due dates, others working weeks advance. Code sloppy attitude toxic. decided step part fault enough experience steer situation.
With new boss, kept behaving like kids HR invited leave. end well...

We lost least 2 clients one individuals. mean, data real time. think something like 10 days old capacity issues. we're seeing 14 days past, makes response shit show. basically good showing trends horseshit medical intelligence. Probably even since kids around middle school age would likely ones finding hilarious cough purpose. I’m sorry housemates suck, it’s fair 

That said, don’t despair, even likely get still take measures improve chances riding well. may even get fine.

If get hitting hard take advantage we’ve learned mitigating severity damage: sleeping face, drinking alcohol, staying hydrated, monitoring symptoms closely, getting intervention soon enough take turn. 

You still take precautions home cleaning things, spending time outside away housemates can.

If get sick recover may lingering symptoms like many people shouldn’t dispair even ordinary pneumonia hurt someone months recovery. It’s entirely possible people lingering symptoms may make full recovery.

It would shame give really know besides, therapeutic treatments recovery improve understanding sequelae improves shot full recovery improves. True, behave similar manner regarding infection channels floridian. Florida getting ultra fucked right now. dual layer cloth mask demonstration traveled 2.5 inches compared 12 ft unmasked. open link.

You looking selfish perspective ""how mask wear protect me"" instead ""how protect others it"" Good. get videos maskless people Fighting Security Guards cops managers Freedom..... It’s almost like kids still people Religion = Brain Cancer  don’t work, like district, go Starbucks soul cycle. People go buy fireworks. Co workers said big crowds. avoided co workers. gov response bad, ppl deserve huge blame. inexcusable wear masks public. info stay safe. People selfish.  Great work pulling time line together. remember clearly wtf moments, seeing detailed chronologically mind blowing. That's I'm getting I’m gonna leave here: posting people see nonbelievers saying. fair, country winter seasonal flu completely disappeared. enough people gets shot, coronavirus completely dominate scene. Hi there. I'm removing due personal information policy (both protection person bill whose email phone # blacked entirely). want remove imgur link, I'd happy reapprove comment. Please feel obligated post personal things random person demands proof.  anyone link study reputable source regarding air conditioning units office spaces transition COVID? I'm curious whether air conditioning units office spaces cause virus spread inefficient that. able find one COVID19 subreddit yet. I've pushing school embrace better teaching practices individualized learning years now. school shut last Spring released surveys asking feedback distance learning ripped new one trying replicate in-person classes. half time session communication effectively broke down. least constant feedback I've able slowly bring teachers side. Now, I'm going working closely one basically redesign curriculum. oldest going 8th grade, youngest K. school district basically treating same. ended opting distance learning, wish option young kids school full time older kids virtual full time. cannot imagine distance learning could possibly work 5-8 year olds. youngest can’t sit still front screen 15 minutes. Exactly. shouldn’t look rare instances think “we fucked.”

There variables play here. real lockdown. Workplaces closed including Walmart/Target.  wait, never happen. Let's admit national anything. spending time others indoors/unmasked contributing problem. 

Can read? install kind elections .. decide every 4 years boss ...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

that would cool read whole thing look like rotten avocado. Dang you!  mean children humans too? get infected carry diseases adult? They're likely asymptomatic adults? fuck would thought that?

Oh. Wait. Yeah.

It's fucking scientists whose job figure shit out. They've saying shit weeks now. nice another study showing seriously, US Govt going ignore it. children go back government funded day care Mommy Daddy go back making obscene profits wealthy much important listening scientists. two sides coin. One negligence parents part contaminating students. school systems penalizing school days missed even doctors note. school system mandatory amount days missed regardless reason student repeat grade. daughter mono kept work returned 100% feeling better due mandate confirmed board education area. manipulating numbers. sounds like lot disrespect misplaced ego ask me. Lots dissilusioned people well. think USA going ass crazy Pandemic.   Literally 50% people grocery store saw mask on, wearing wrong. Like chin strap, covering nose. infuriating. What's point requirements gonna enforce people even wear correctly? ^(endogenous spread exogenous spread atm mate. house already fire instead putting out, worried guy running matchstick.) Ok. ask myself: assumption best. expect immunity get infected, continue avoid re-infection equal vigor, confidence get again. seems burden prove lies immunity camp, re-infection camp. is, I'll believe acquired immunity there's 2-3 year data set showing real. Literally first sentence article... **""After coronavirus outbreak wearing plastic visors infected, Swiss government said plastic shields inadequate protection worn combination face mask.""** Oh man, occasionally turn Fox News see saying. week ago caught Tucker Carlson. read: don’t know you’re aware bad sick leave USA Americans get 10 days sick leave (on average), plus public holidays. According Bureau Labor Statistics, half employers provide five nine days paid sick leave one year working company.“

In USA work “at will” meaning fired time reason (except discrimination proven) it’s unheard fired taking many sick days. Also there’s guaranteed sick leave Americans. America job postings sick leave listed “benefit” course, US, can't contribute captalist system, pretty much useless. Hence many plants US continued opeate despite getting hundred cases. China would shut soon found one case.  got COVID, die comorbidities illness sucks.

Constantly tired, feeling hot headed, can't smell anything, loss taste. First days symptoms straight high fever well.

Even risk group want catch this. research post recovery long term symptoms many. bad Trump look pictures. 1 3.5 million chance. Sure, possible, internet. Chances bullshit excuse.

Going back original reasoning though - Even true, happens infrequently really worth even considering making policies virus. Nevada City actually named state was! Also, Nevada County shaped like gun pointing state Nevada stole name. Look up! Herpes viruses last forever permanently insert DNA cells. There’s nothing suggest coronavirus anything like that. Hot damn, good posting gimmick  real? They've brought morgue trucks San Antonio. 5 days ago stories number available ICU beds state 10%.

And try make witty joke this? Unless change happen after. Changes need make happen way Corona otherwise momentum die. Well know guys, I'm going Disney! 

Ep-cough Center favorite! Burger King outright owns Hungry Jack's chain. Target USA sold name whoever owns Target name Australia, Target Australia independent. Target tried expand Canada, subsidiary USA company. depends deal was.

Edited examples important thing Trump listen anyone voice head dead father screaming German. beyond ridiculously stupid anyone even considering playing sports year. Sports never essential. Like last line, people seem prefer comfortable lies truth I’m Texas we’re currently competing Florida 3rd infected state (we bit, Florida gonna Florida). local news alone: *For 16th day row, Dallas County health officials reported more 1,000 new coronavirus cases, reported deadliest week COVID-19.* it’s Summer. imagine bad it’s going get things finally cool around October. think people think Asian; think countries like China, Koreas, Japan, Phillipines, Vietnam etc. 

People think India Asians pakistans Iraq Afghanistan etc they're apart continent Asia. Da fuck kinda logic this, 3 positive tests count 1 3 negative count 3??? People numb it. Back cases deaths doubling every 3 days, can’t wrap brain around that. way, it’s nice, become numb death going idiocy wearing mask public. gotta know we're going test findings, ""in field.""

Like everything we've done shoot collective feet, pandemic, wish army epidemiologists contract tracers working within every school district opens in-classroom instruction. relatives St. Louis. never write back try see us, think kind conservative. worry though. sound like anything going well all. significant spikes? mean whole country spiking? State capitalist accurate representation though. implement socialism communism. free market determines prices. People businesses. invest. They're thousands billionaires.

Saying capitilast gross oversimplification read entire article? risk need work able take sick leave (providing financial support would help alleviate that). Many uninsured (meaning arent receiving proportional medical support)

People may receive care of distrust healthcare system, language barriers, cost missing work.

Racism, stigma, systemic inequities undermine prevention efforts, increase levels chronic toxic stress, ultimately sustain health healthcare inequities.

Compared non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics almost 3 times likely be uninsured, non-Hispanic blacks almost twice likely uninsured. age groups, blacks likely non-Hispanic whites report able see doctor past year cost. 2017, almost 3 times many American Indians Alaska Natives no health insurance coverageexternal icon compared non-Hispanic whites.

Income, education, joblessness: average, racial ethnic minorities earn less non-Hispanic whites, less accumulated wealth, lower levels educational attainment, higher rates joblessness. factors affect quality social physical conditions people live, learn, work, play, impact health outcomes.

Damn near paste entire article you. Pretty sure see qualify legally blind. pasted anything fact risk getting sick. clearly states minorities unable receive medical assistance disproportionate rate, mostly due financial systemic reasons. 

Financial support programs would alleviate problem. That's charity provided: money. understand failing see. 100% accurate! exactly republican party formed wealthy politicians followers, politicians called ""know nothings"". There's idea U.S. mass gatherings fine long they're outside people wearing masks.  (protests rallies mostly).  Italy - -and European countries turned tide - mindset?  specific protests, people music festivals, crowded days parks, etc, masks, considered safe? Exactly. teach junior high. Even age, anyone thinks kids keep masks social distance 7 hours lost mind.

Shows picture government employee contact tracers working together office instead easily telecommuting. Headdesk hell surprised? Jfc can’t even comprehend ignorance question ""do want bunker place 24 months?"" That's false 

They know this. They'll still make argument bad faith low-educated voters make distinction. That's cool, that's choice. clearly actually know much country yet happy believe news tells it. Seems strange know bad news agencies America are. Yup. Literally nothing mentions *wearer* prevent passing it.

Literally supporting point again. point I'm wondering completely misread I've saying. NYC right? Part reason AZ nightmare followed NY model sending patients overflowed hospitals nursing homes... infect vulnerable people there. Right now, NYC large segment (20%?) immunity, drastically handicapping spread. I'm going take away points NYC's climate, people know basically leave AC peak summer southern states.

A state well one significant urban centers never got huge death counts/immunity early vigilant mask usage keeping cumulative cases down. think northern places temperate weather, places course vulnerable since much immunity built up. Sad part he'll probably survive without damaging effects spew BS COVID-19 safe  i’m from, parents still live there. They’re feeling overwhelmed they’re largely Tr*mp supporters don’t believe exists understand we’re middle horrible pandemic dying insolence. I’ve said before, i’ll say again: wear fucking mask course will. Anyone thinks otherwise insane.

The Antonine Plague, Plague Justinian, Black Death, Spanish Flu, many more. Humankind plagues make Covid-19 look like goddamned stubbed toe, always return normal.

Things ALWAYS go back normal, normal natural. Human nature socialize, connect, laugh, gather, enjoy life. NEVER change. may improvements like people washing hands more, think anyone extreme minority going live rest lives things like wearing masks distancing, sorely mistaken. cases anywhere, report weekends. Sir, due respect, believe confused Stephen Miller Jared Kushner. Whilst seeing resemblance, *fuckingtwatsnotlicker* shall confused *fuckingasshatdicklicker*. Please make notation confusion future.

So well qualified experienced nurses employed, you’re left “lots people” barely passed exams getting hired. He's busy golfing. Damn, phase III? freedoms Agreed masking always fellow EMT. CT.

That said, gonna real shocker folks realize government surveillance already every iota financial records, public records, cell phone tracking history, etc. file since day born. fact would need use Covid cover tracking Patriot Act NSA exists rather comical me. 😂 I'm paranoid hell virus, take precautions can, still times remind really bad is. Like really, really bad, world outside window still looks mostly normal. 

The Lincoln Project ad mentioned laid coffins U.S. COVID deaths side-by-side, would line coffins *66 miles long.* sounds unbelievable, it? true, math yourself. that's since March.  

But still, outside house, beautiful, sunny Summer day. almost wish smoke flames everywhere remind everyone bad is.  Jesus, sorry dude. Racism rampant US experienced it. TL;DR: It'll speed amount testing done combining parts 4 samples together. 4 test positive they'll retest sample individually someone researched NK extensively anyone ever to, every time i'm confronted NK media, think words North Korean doctor book ""Nothing Envy."" really academic source, sums NK well, nothing else comes close. 

A North Korean doctor known Dr. Kim (for safety) succeeds escaping NK borders China. One first things sees Chinese family put bowl rice dog night. 

""She still wanted believe country best place world. beliefs cherished lifetime would vindicated. deny staring plainly face: dogs China ate better doctors North Korea."" Really... still....? need peer reviewed double blind studies find rest world know forever. 

It's embarrassing... CDC, thinking lying public save health care workers instead trusting public would right thing, given information mask shortages, equally embarrassing. (And we're still paying price due anyone planet earth that's already dying find new conspiracy) Courage stop virus. need someone angry ""wrecking economy"", watch video:   

By following social distancing mask use recommendations, every person video (with exception handful mask wearers) **PROLONGING PANDEMIC UNITED STATES.** Correct. detection rate doubled tests, we're missing cases well. even care think point saying completely accurate strays NYC praise narrative. started telling I'm arguing political viewpoint can't stand Trump fan base. Sad simply disagreeing stating facts political.  isn’t entirely true - seems like children likely get virus adults - reports children infected adults - it’s estimated children 10 extremely low chance getting usually recover mild symptoms relatively quickly. believe around 1-2 percent people infected children - cases children 10 - believe it’s possible children may even able infected younger ages. little evidence around world children infecting adults - teachers take precautions social distance/ wear mask etc. - believe extremely low chance catching virus even child gets sick daycare. Especially children get sick- school proper amount time recover - daycare partially held outdoors - everything looks positive negative schools/daycares young children - try stress - information changes (as every day) would say reevaluate comes try stay positive! Kate Brown hero America needs right now. driven infection rates solid-as-a-rock science practical measures. medical swat team outstanding. decisive action took clean house employment department shows absolute commitment people state. Legend. Put dollar bill already! EVIL there’s way see it. Push agenda?? moron believes everything see TV. say someone better means number fucking idiot. Remember outraged libertines bitching OC council meetings masks weeks ago? fair, masks don’t protect caronavirus way. protect people. Ignorance apathy enemy.  hero... Ive covered another comment. 

The Coronavirus family specifically act like retroviruses simplex viruses. embed genome lay dormant causing problems years later. 

Also study linked touches important point viruses **do** act way. 

Illnesses *thought* caused viruses **do** embed genome **and lay dormant** like retroviruses simplex viruses (not coronavirus family members) generally factors play.

Using example lupus (extremely rare) thought potentially viral component EBV... EBV incredibly common, lupus rare? requires strong genetic components well. study linked

Youre really digging deep enough kind statement this?

NYC even close subways. Blablabla essential working need travel lets keep largest vector open. 

I family NYC. Refrigerated trucks, stacked bodies, nursing home death traps. 

Fauci? Hello? Doesnt New York literally highest death count? fuck right? fucking stupid morons? tests work. Results coming less 3 days. 1 week Trump made ""I kid"" comment slowing testing told tests. er. testing resumed, results 10+ days. literally changed course couple days us. 20 us team working came conclusion. Everyone jumped Trump listening Fauci comments like even liberal think reasoning. ridiculous statement, New York horrible example do. Oh totally believe it, lived Colorado leaves gorgeous there, nothing like eastern states. tourists flock area certain attraction typically total inconsiderate pigs. 

I saying (edit: are, thought original person replied to) cute calling that! 😊 It’s win-win situation enemy. one ignoring science. that's phase ll. corona test.

duh.

i probably add /s, gotta believe people gotta believe it. virus got number vast majority idiots get die. insist dying day hoax.  Getting hit hard virus?? idiot governor sent sick old people back retirement homes killed everyone moron  ""I agree statement everybody wear mask everything disappears,"" Trump said. ""Dr. Fauci said wear mask, Surgeon General, terrific guy, said wear mask. Everybody saying wear mask. sudden everybody's got wear mask, know, masks cause problems too, said, I'm believer masks. think masks good."" 

This quote trump recently. Like fuck even mean. anti maskers portions country population confused AF. don’t care vaccine completely safe long much safer COVID-19. 
I want vaccine effective, however. worry, Trump fix that.  secure... Or.. need work. There's chance vaccine result worse reaction versus nothing all. real chance. There's kinds risks might appear 30,000 person trial show smaller trials.  don’t know symptoms know little ones, get tested tell enough. it, he. someone shot people servicing 5G tower too. Complete crazies. Here's since like cherry pick fucking read rest page/s: spreads mainly person person respiratory droplets produced infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, raises voice (e.g., shouting, chanting, singing). droplets land mouths noses people nearby possibly inhaled lungs. Recent studies show significant portion individuals COVID-19 lack symptoms (are “asymptomatic”) even eventually develop symptoms (are “pre-symptomatic”) transmit virus others showing reduce spread COVID-19, CDC recommends people wear cloth face coverings public settings around people outside household, especially social distancing measures difficult important wear cloth face face coverings may help prevent people COVID-19 spreading virus others. **Wearing cloth face covering help protect people around you, including higher risk severe illness COVID-19 workers frequently come close contact people (e.g., stores restaurants).

Literally anywhere except nursing home Damn, may literally killed constituents.  Scrubs keep scrubbing. think you’re relying pretty narrow view parents experiencing. regard daycare, it’s lovey daydream unrealistic. reality shutting schools good idea, extended school closures mean children suffer - including left home alone unsafe, rely school food protection abuse, etc etc - plenty don’t computers WiFi attend virtually. isn’t even mention kids special needs can’t learn online. people Facebook groups don’t represent larger picture all.

Going eat friends. Concerts. Sports games.  come hug give sniffles? I've running theory lot anti-lockdown protesters much financially stressed (though many were) much bored death annoyed hell spend much time family. 

I imagine though suddenly spending ton time someone used seeing maybe couple hours day, dynamic completely changes. exposed covid writing anything unusual body covid symptom. tested negative well. bad allergies sniffle developed assumed symptom lol. get back head diseases like cold/flu/allergies exist. mean you’re really concerned would try get test would assume okay considering test negative. Lol odd all. Story made sad too, service industry years understand asshole customers well. Start asking [main US media belongs might start answer.

Or ask [Spanish 1918 called ""Spanish flu"".

Overwhelmingly? Uhh yes larger portion black/brown people ignoring aren't? Even Asian Americans affected shockingly ever said couldn’t? New York! they’ll use high school classrooms disperse elementary middle school students greater areas,

I've heard suggested live would work? take class 30 elementary/middle school kids put among four classrooms socially distance presumably right? getting extra three teachers teach classes? going online classes classroom hire someone basically baby sit they're there? point, not?

Good Luck everyone.  epidemiologist hell wouldn’t “catch corona” multiple times. it’s miserable every time, damages brain organs, kill you. You’d rather one day mild sickness? wondering conspiracies absurd ends rational minded people know play game. 

There thousands millions people believe bullshit elected positions power, accumulated vasts sums money, run huge propaganda networks. They're essentially bringing society them. 

So society striving exist within paradigms efficacy evidence facts combat sociological virus? 

You must dare people put money mouths are.

SHAME Absolutely. think 20% one cloth mask. cloth mask studies much better that, likely ""cloth"" exactly empirically defined might different thickness, density etc. I'm getting son face shield go mask extra layer protection. Little kids sneeze face without thinking.  pick local Walmart. *Maybe* 50% people saw walking masks. One older dude ""shuffle walk,"" mask. Oddly also see groups wearing masks aren't. What's that? Usually younger people wearing mask. strange. thought mask loophole well opened. extremely obvious.  kids far adaptable people give credit for. actually done math? Hypothesize normal distribution time immunity wanes point reinfection possible, median three, four, six months standard deviation month so. calculate per person infection rate currently apply small percentage people would leading left tail curves. find numbers quite small. first one picked, six month median, one month standard deviation, yielded approximately 12 25 reports reinfection US. Oh sure, parents don’t inkling child sick. happens scares year fact soooooo many child show symptoms covid-19 sent infect many others. thought N95s work source transmission. protect others you? Country* wonder experience even worth die hards.

Maybe November florida July hot mess without mask subconscious concern severe disease. Question antibody testing. got tested covid got negative results today. close contact confirmed positive, symptoms. Genuinely curious reason didn’t catch due antibodies already, (I haven’t sick lately, January heard don’t go back far idk really works determine it) worth it? possible actually catch covid develop antibodies?

Then again, thought New Yorkers ""leaders"" COVID-19 containment! No? Oh well.... “I’ll listen “*experts*” says cites single professor’s opinion article May.

Teachers pay taxes too. gotta save toner bro Around 2 million probably upper bound, given that's 0.6% US 0.6% current best estimate fatality rate cases (tested not). would 100% US infected.

I think estimates NYC something like 25% population infected. 25% 2 million 500k.... crazy guess keeps spreading.

More 25% could infected though goes long without vaccine effective treatment. Although even getting 25% US take while. saw meme too. real numbers. makes sense, good reason everyone wear mask public, numbers got illustration. shit... let’s stick head toe, average 6 ft per individual.

There's joke insecure short men here, know it. would imagine ready first thing morning.

You sound like one western leftist nerds always shits actually existing socialism. 

Is go line something along lines “what Vuvuzela?” Instead saying doctors nurses start saying healthcare workers? know implied, technologist sees patients COVID everyday honestly feel like vast majority healthcare employees disregarded frontline.

That's unlikely happen. accepted evidence presented situation begin with. guys affairs I’m sure went back looked....a month ago crossing 120,000....20,000 covid deaths month. Testing problems mostly false negatives. false positives. Cool! (Regular unemployment enough prevent drop spending) surprising - damn. Thats totally new news me. couldnt think before.

Next news: 1+1=2. would surprise alot. school heavily project based learning act facilitators inquiry based learning. online experience mirror closely possible, distance. Hospitalization numbers er visits trending Arizona days. Due apparent testing backlog long takes patients die, that’s accurate indicator Arizona. 

I suppose theoretically, another spike could happen, isn’t it’s played anywhere else US. Regular unemployment really really small lot states. am, cover rent utilities leaves $50 food month. think shield combination mask quite functional people. least, could help people terms fiddling masks. extent might also protect mask really contaminated even one adjusts mask fiddles it, might much viral load surface. Also protect eyes may may source contamination. Theoretically one could drink straw shield :-)

I well stocked masks = masks made quilting cotton (which supposed effective cloth masks. read silk layer quilting layer adds effectiveness kind electrostatic charge traps aerosolized virus particles. Flannel also supposed quality flannel would think warmer silk skin. mask also layer filter kind.

I also disposable surgical masks supply KN95 masks authorized NON-COUNTERFEIT supplier US. read almost effective N95 except possible fit issues people non-high risk situations, much factor.

Obviously experts learning one take best advice time seems though masks seen providing level protection WEARER well.

It also appears (at least read) viral load may something becoming infected even severe one gets. theory people relatively normal immune systems deal small amount virus. Hence risk outdoor transmission social distancing wearing mask smaller small enclosed non-ventiliated place amount virus one could ingesting would higher. Also amount time might impact viral load - shopping quickly large relatively well ventilated store would safer spending longer period time small area. Wow, sounds like selfish person. blame one bit putting kids first ditching man. awful, though. worse mask payoff? get family sick idiots distancing wearing masks properly.

This benefit wearing valved vs non valved mask. Lets stick reality, shall we?

You always cover vent. Unless care course.  Dutch health organization RIVM concluded young kids increased spreading virus Holland, since primary schools reopened.

Adults spreading much days either. valid conclusion children can't, place control. 

Would conclude adults can't spread spreading virus control? ""I've really considering ditching LA""

Joe Rogan every podcast Far norm, indeed, magnify numbers promoting recklessness undermining health experts. Ffs, care many people die, he? 13 year old dying would trigger medical examiner autopsy  many things terrifies pandemic, attack public ed one scariest. greatest equalizer we've working class underprivileged access education education related materials are, way, democratic. less people going education, weaker gets result, society going turn online tools teach kids districts become cash strapped without good workers. smart enough understand environment around teaching currently understand big sacrifice be.

As online educators start fill gap, given capital districts pandemic starting gap, control big business corporations information. Everything become monetized, certainly community based. surprised districts parents start pay accredited programs locked similarly colleges Pearson McDougall Littell leading charge.

This also considering access constrained devices tools necessary online learning. Hell, even thinking things simple computer iPad rarely gets thought about. parent spend items education, means there's less food rent. addition, parent need spend time setting proper environment, give support needed; simply put, many parents either resources skills sometimes achieve this. 

In gap, many people would benefit greatly somebody like daughter get fucked. Losing prospective young people bad profession daughter, right apocalyptic society based assessment. trying doomer, fucking oof I'm sorry experience. That's kind learning experience designing online district, clearly feelings I'm going try change them. article UK. wonder US access well? mean, duh? 

Did people know this? hard say bc deaths rising big certain states lag lot. Texas seems going rise rapidly. [Or maybe don’t Yes, 24 hours day, seven days week children almost 0 external entertainment plus financial stress plus actual threats health life stress enough break even strong relationships decade history. 

I'm firm believer committed couples survive one serious crisis time. Multiple crises occurring time, even couple committed, compassionate, love tear relationship foundations apart. know say can't love someone wholly first unless whole yourself? That's pressure comes situations like this.

It's ""true colors"" coming cheating incompatibility. even well-adjusted good person, coping mechanisms partner's serious psychological stressors probably compatible, usually one member couple deal time. father dies. loses job. fertility problems. spouse rock one pain support healing. lose child, example, two spouses torn apart often leads divorce. Covid stresses everyone once. make tactful demand anxiety level increased point person would jeopardize ability focus maintain necessary responsibility waste money/time? Also, say relative moved high risk, doubt would ask proof...and jinxing anyone one really moved in....stay well!!! I'm praying whole wack mole approach localised lockdowns work get vaccine. Unskilled workers willing risk lives business?

Say ain't so... I'm glad smart enough send patients back nursing homes spread disease. Great job New York 👍  last count.  Yep. average person, getting good info would've much difficult daily newspapers. look lag info finally makes mainstream news, stuff learning Youtube March, finally reported consensus June.  Yeah dude, you’d really think so, sadly true. I'm going vote, too. process it, I’m stupid assume everybody opportunities do. bruh basically every study come recently essentially “everybody spreads coronial virus ease”. 

...isn’t sort knew along? 

Regardless age, everyone spread it? need one good teacher subject. record lesson accessed students country again. tear schools, fire teachers lower taxes. I'm it. teachers mediocre anyways earn pay. would think end date included original bill? think fed print trillions dollars keep us afloat

That going happen regardless (is already happening), alternative large-scale economic collapse. big debate whether money gets distributed via unaccountable grifter-administered slush fund political patronage kickbacks administrators, whether goes directly residents.

It’s absurd one richest powerful countries world can’t even handle basic disaster relief, politicized much.

Controlling virus (and making sure people stay afloat undertake measures control virus) priority #1 everyone. faster control virus, faster get back whatever previous business was.

Nearly every developed country world less figured out.

Yes it’s expensive: that’s get underfunding public health infrastructure decades. Public health funding *before* crisis among best bargains world. fair essential workers though? work/risk lives upkeep society everyone else gets live food rent free? want replaced computer? Ok taking 50 percent pay cut? Children carry *much higher* concentration influenza viruses adults, factor 10.000 times higher. carry *same* amount Corona viruses adults. course people need find means. Less mask use stayed closed long time. Still closed parts US. cathartic, thank you. ive months. nice put label recognize limit it. He's stupid. much worse. want clarify DeSantis make attractive starting salary teachers. basically said wanted number make look good, give enough funding number reached within counties. Similar saying everything 90% off, things may 0 15 20% still fall category. Realistically vaccine widely distributed, there's going big rush reopen everything -- bars, clubs, indoor dining, concerts, NFL games fans, etc. Many activities allowed reopen places rising case numbers natural immunity! It'll prudent wait month two anything high risk see well things going, people probably going head straight vaccination site group hugathon local bar.

As everything, weigh risks, government cares re-opening businesses generate tax revenue, personally expendable them. I'll probably wear mask month get shot, wait bit longer hang indoors family friends, I'm stepping bar we're 0 new local cases weeks. Warp speed invest vaccine (oxford), $1.2 billion dollars towards it. good chance may give us access point. would pay peace mind. Mask use people actively sick.

What sick fuck. really sad thing go it, anything refrigerators freezer disposed. Anti-maskers entitled wasteful aholes. god doctors scientists working vaccine! Many can’t without losing retirement jobs.  not. 

And spend rest comment saying is. 

You trying ways. may ask you:

DO believe study speaking shows children can't spread virus like adults can?

I apologize trying pin specific argument, seem slippery.

EDIT: grammer mean indoor rally without masks shielded UV enclosed ventilation system vs outdoor rallies people wearing masks fresh air constant UV exposure?

You mean tell two completely different scenarios different?

Holy fuck science deniers joke. can’t wait see inbred morons try Walmart, Aldi, CVS etc. small town Ohio think joke doesn’t exist. said younger generation good anything! news, 🔥 hot. can't fix stupid unfortunately. feel brother l situation parents died month apart.

Good luck everything!! :) someone explain president holding interview morning showed US lowest mortality rate world? life me, cannot find single dataset true. B cells cells, yo 5 straight days? surprising reached testing capacity? first time watch boat race whole way pull off. Screw Cambridge let's go Oxford!   NAVY! They’re either deep someone’s pocket they’re stupid.  Woo exponential growth! moment get college I'm applying med schools far away ga possible I'm surprised. mom broke ankle work went working 12 hour shifts sitting home months. realized pretty quickly actually like dad around often. I'm sure true thousands couples forced stay home together days.  minimize anything do, hospital healthcare workers much direct contact patients doctors outside procedures makes crazy too. act like heroes coming sick. Stay home! one wants work sick. Omg, watch russian hackers again... sound logical approach handling virus, worry, America fuck Yes. one saying less spending.

The sacrifices going required get things back semblance normalcy going blow.most people's minds.

This warm up. know going need another stay-at-home order fucking issue rather later save lives Someone else suggesting move local system next time doubts that. I’d interested see much infection rates drop mask + face shield combo worn, compared masks alone. Also, much protection face shield offers wearer others worn itself. case hotel’s staff, x number face shield wearers got infected (and 1 guest served them). would happen wearing facial protection (neither face shields masks)? Wouldn’t transmission rate higher? 

For real scientific value, control group, wasn’t (understandably, though). there’s crucial information missing article well, kind masks employees wearing.

I honestly doubt said face shields offer protection (there couple studies show otherwise), believe they’re still way better nothing (aside potential psychological side effect people feeling safer behaving less cautiously - also happens problem masks). Yea, I'm stay home mom basically came conclusions immediately reading headlines days ago. pretty logical. It’s slowing testing capabilities Wait. masks protect people? thought protected people you. Texan, agree. 

I haven’t left house long, that’s I’m smarter Yee-haw! long source Dr. Nick Riviera.  mad bro? That’s point. I’m aware current CA would pace catch Germany. I’m also aware Germany twice many people CA. 

That still doesn’t change fact CA twice many reported cases fewer deaths Germany. point almost every country world hasn’t identified cases well. Cases almost always fraction actual infected. based deaths estimate true amount infections.

So USAs case numbers outrageous compared EU countries. deaths deaths per million better (to point) several EU countries (not Germany) major outbreaks earlier year. might remain way, shall see since anytime country opens get hit again. 

I’m mostly pointing poor people numbers adjusting things like population incredibly wide variation “official cases”. So...my mom says people going hospital aren’t, afraid catching Covid. go it’s beyond hope, gone early, wouldn’t died, waited, can’t saved.

She’s boomer, say? 2020, regarded smart. I’m wondering judgement. Can't wait see billionaires get financial assistance next slowing down. mean still weeks pain ahead. virus 1918, black plague, etc.

The black death bacteria (Yersinia pestis) virus, we've dealing Y. Pestis since neolithic age. became problem people bunched together large cities like Byzantines European Middle ages. 

We got control adoption germ theory antibiotics. Welcome common sense! Cutting thru Bull since Man began. That’s good.

EDIT: still lot stupid shit caught video posted /r/Houston I'm still curious going enforce this. Sure, might security detail catch one two offenders either warn temporarily ban park, can't police thousands park visitors daily.

Sadly, relies people actually adhering guidelines rules established, already proven numerous times pandemic people willingly trying thwart. see feasible long term. genuinely low IQ. breed    Apocalypse junkies!  went universal opened June. employees held patrons high standard would politely tell pull mask people cheating nose out. honestly impressed. I'm Canada familiar US unemployment, could tell much one would get low range high range, assuming based much make cap upper range. I'm talking ""experts"" said arent risk getting covid attending BLM protest, days ""experts"" said Trump holding rally gunna cause spike covid cases...interesting...its almost virus holds political views way different spring. Teachers time prepare transition one thing. another, lot districts 'everything pass-fail' 'your grade cannot drop period' way grading, kids blew everything off. Neither I. I'll probably double check get back I'm wrong. future note, it’s good assume anything. get data get better understanding nature virus, it’s really hard confirm anything point. timing tests also matters too. Though, saying likely happening.  make safe calculated cases, also active ones. However, terrible :/ still busses get report enclosed high risk parts visit.

I agree whole US able inact policies strong could still safely activities. Maybe trying take heat uncle 😆 guys also know water wet??? shit spread effectively, God i’m Idiocracy shit. states locked immediately highest death rates too. There’s evidence suggesting locking positive effect this. still think masks effective hasn’t done anything direction. one knows hell whopping 23,686 people recorded newly recovered Quebec Friday, slashing overall number active cases Canada 80 per cent. Quebec brings total number active cases Canada officials said previously listed people longer hospital recovered. new system, tested positive longer hospitalized listed recovered 14 days. know say except America's school yearbooks going alot empty picture spots, memorial pages year. guess ""whole 4 months"" memories fallible learned nothing Trump's mistake bragged couple isolated cases then. not. research states children (specifically Holland) affect reproduction rate virus significantly. However, virus still spreads. conclusion made that, according RIVM, spread mostly adults. Like fellow redittor pointed out, sources indicated differently; makes RIVM conclusions remarkable. Username checks told supporter prez1d3nt yesterday messaged state health care worker know.  health care worker said hospital full. supporter said numbers fake. said lockdowns spread covid. Mario Romero Pérez gained recognition peruvian press due selling medicinal oxygen normal price, businesses prioritized profits instead helping patients Peru, 6th country cases world. helped families couldnt afford reffil oxygen tanks hospitals simply people couldnt get medical attention all. even reports scammers sellling industrial oxygen desperate families could get medical attention due tu hospitals full capacity.

Peru currently 349,500 cases 12,998 deaths, although numers thought much higher.

Edit: typo/wording obviously mean people going stop spending money entirely.  course!! [Canadians Someone jealous seems make sense case obvious doctor. And?

My point simply fed kicker ending, unemployment altogether. Anything do, better That's good hear even though best idea things go back normal US vaccine released Previous studies stated “kids” ineffective transmitters virus. study revises state young kids still don’t spread well, teens can.  work hospital VT, many coworkers avid ""antiscience types"" wear masks. hope manage stay low infection rates, comes spreaders volunteering isolate / wear masks. discouraging hell. least job. long employers mentality ""crawl work sick dont call work sick"" people send kids school sick. all, American way. situations contract therefore don’t transmit doesn’t mean can’t. implies somehow virus gets kid “what”? Young people’s lungs filter don’t spread out? inhale virus exhale spread it. virus doesn’t go person, ask spread, get permission host go back out. breathe.

Kids get it. Anybody lungs transmit it. Show study kids knowingly situations adults got infected didn’t infected didn’t transmit single person. Correct reason. 20/20 looking back much even help masks since stores almost never anyways. Would better saying homemade masks ok really need medical stuff hospitals, trying funnels health care.

I think main regret context saying maybe mistake, well intentioned, used drive public distrust medical crowd.  americans sheltered blood gore gratuitous details things really like. really strange doesnt help us good reason. don’t want sick idiots FL can’t refrain eating inside restaurant drinking inside bar infecting responsible states. don’t understand anyone would want eat inside restaurant pandemic. That’s gross disgusting. would anyone go shopping brick mortar store pandemic? Gross. said anything single life? even pay attention world around you? 600,000 people died COVID numbers still increasing rapidly. understand exponential growth? Please look viral transmission works.

Definitely daycare. Yes lot parents need functionality school taking kids work jobs. almost every parent cares kids education.

Calling daycare dumb point view. Diminishes role teachers, parents. understand you’re saying appreciate willingness evolve based new info, it’s trait shared few.

With said, schools open kind numbers we’re seeing Florida certain parts Texas, coupled total unwillingness wear masks inaccurate test result reports zero contact tracing? Isn’t little early say anything definitive? 

I read one child daycare infecting 16 others. don’t understand can’t won’t happen send fourth grader school September masks classroom, per district’s plan.

Chris Wallace, sharply challenging Trump's Testing narrative, told him, ""testing 37 percent...Cases 194 percent.""

Trump: ""Many cases young people would heal day. sniffles put test.""

 Trump continued: ""We go look news...you'll see 'cases up.' Cases -- many cases even cases.""  debt get fucked up. players people, people stupid. going get inside bubble. Staring next year? I’m going online school sure now! anyways school’s football coach COVID they’re still continuing practice. kid COVID yet come! Yet industrialized countries better performing schools US resort participation awards.  Likely sounds like logical cure 2 months lockdown. problem dont see country many enemies virus easy transmit. Even eradicated us enemies would bring back. means economy would decimated would still virus again. Lockdowns unfortunately arent answer. Well that's point said propaganda, make proud country. Kids clearly sick constantly schools daycare school district policy could miss 3 days (I missed 5 days &amp; parents got letter district threatening legal action. Fucking insane). even then, high school could miss 1 else allowed exempt final exams. really really hope school districts enforcing already bullshit policies like middle school. 

(I grew Texas btw) Since Reagan Oh, doubt. But, I’m pretty sure rules much work/how much money make retire Social Security pensions/401k retirement plan payments concerned. described life right honestly needs happen sooner later though. sentiment wanting leave Facebook “stuck” need work, school, family etc everyone there. Nobody wants there, think.

Hopefully find something better soon, Zuck monster.

In meantime: Society needs boomers die mass probably happen themselves.  get antibody tests? many immigrants came elite nation? Well initial [worse case projections start outbreak 214 million infected 1.7 million that's anyone thought Americans would stupid enough COVID parties, purposefully try infect others. That’s insulting It’s going really depressing there’s page two end yearbooks memorializing teachers students died covid services tend work better national level anyway.

Exactly. live VT plan Shumlin legislature absolutely unsustainable due tiny economy already high tax burden. could probably work CA, bigger economy majority countries universal health care.

We're going give year plus wanting implement execute friggin' containment strategy. interesting see enforce. I've seen people wearing masks chinstraps less, customers employees both. Kind defeats whole purpose masks. Good point. said seem domestic support information. number outbreaks summer camps one, probably important 31% infection rate kids Florida.

Yes, know that's tested 54,022 Florida residents age 18. tests, 16,797, 31%, come back positive. positivity rate Florida's entire population stands roughly 11%. things come straight away. would except work abroad live family spread across three continents way really keep contact otherwise. relationship conducted Facebook I'm work. always simple.

Whistleblowers said mild strain first mutated worse strain China.



The ccp provided samples mild strain international research. Seriously!!! fuck they?! people literally killing hundreds thousands. others said, it’s entirely clear. governor could make order sued target state, would court decide. 

Instead, states quarantine orders states. NY list states anyone allowed travel required quarantine two weeks arrival. I'd like answer question last comment. Stupid sciences bitches couldn’t even make DeSantis smarter lol literally said hopes become numb move on. really heartless stupid think stock market gains? People still havent learned anything last pandemic.  That’s correct. wearing mask could save one single life, would worth you? One tiny life? multiply 300 million people. exactly mindset have.

If every cold flu season hospitals became overrun dead bodies trucked state, healthcare workers sat daily car sobbed, people like youngest employee losing husband cancer able hospital months treatment eventual death. leu death, healthcare worker hold tablet - healthcare workers sign for. absolutely, 100%. Yeah, agree. Magical thinking way stop pandemic. Miami Herald source literally says exactly saying. 


What think headline “Facing shortages beds remdesivir, South Florida hospitals halt elective surgeries” means?


And say “elective surgeries aren’t thing” mean?

Do know elective surgery is? ""In 100 years, nobody remember deaths. They'll remember 'stache."" 

Dutch national institute public health. can't read Dutch explained graphs well.

Edit. want explain certain parts let know, speak Dutch. beating little, redheaded step brother playing yourself, yeah like that. Edmondson 4 term attorney general deep roots Oklahoma Brad Henry, popular Oklahoma governor history, stumping him. imply unelectable wrong. fact next name allow straight ticket voting killed him. real problem democrats forever lost Little Dixie picking OKC+metro Tulsa+metro. surely fully truthful home made masks medical grade different story. debate never around effectiveness medical grade ones. home made ones handling (false level confidence). said understand point. reason kinda get pass came around deny said back then. can't understand people quoting 'mistake' still trying suggest masks work. company preceded show 25 years. Easter, 2075 saying - generally take precautions cold flu season. Increased washing hands - letting sick people prepare food - places like schools using hand sanitizer wipes etc. Sure ""cleaning"" inconvenience, too. Maybe stop cleaning things.

However argument already ridiculous still comparing COVID-19 seasonal cold/flu. debunked within first couple weeks spread Italy 30k people died. Keep denying everything bud, makes country look great Like want us die may true, coronavirus proved unpredictable. There's nothing certain comes virus Wow.. say, parent three, I’ve there. It’s fucking hard, heartbreaking choice make. I’m lucky partner mother work healthcare, schedules allow home children often. That’s convenience many don’t have. 

I work small secular private school. school charges lot tuition, also takes many children state scholarships, wide range incomes somewhat diverse population students town we’re in. 

Long story short, I’ve parent teacher side this. It’s wrong (and unfortunately school happens often parents they’re paying care children) one resources pretty easily call work, or, like large chunk families, parent home could easily kept child called nanny. 

But didn’t find moral fault parents know option, especially child mildly sick. 

I unfortunately go back soon. I’m really hopeful parents many resources right thing stay home much possible never come school ill. It’s fair parents must work little resources children exposed unnecessarily. (Not mention underpaid teachers, many children spread school, exposed several classrooms, shortage subs....). parents resources, decisions even loaded, stressful, financially, emotionally difficult virus. culture come work.

There is. call ""America."" mask protect you, others would gotten regardless solution? try Got news ya bud, shit going world next year  🖕  Cancer contagious. Next time performance review questions leadership, point Trump. DeSantis, enemy.  Thing AZ's enormous testing backlog positivity % trustworthy itself. they're prioritizing publication backlogged tests, would seeing misleading results time disease widespread lower positivity.

At least hospitalization numbers transparent, luckily they've improved bit... power % populace shrinking. I’m hoping maybe silver lining pandemic state budget (and therefore school districts, etc.) screwed finally dismantle TABOR. huge step towards making Colorado even better place live (it already close paradise). sure.  hope kind point I'm trying make everyone good time calling idiot. worry, hockey tournaments going strong midwest state speak. I'm sure totally fine. /s waivers standard on. Isn’t Oxford vaccine based past vaccine techniques proven safe years? get trepidation new, unproven technologies mRNA vaccine prototypes; but, Oxford vaccine somewhat similar annual flu vaccine, also doesn’t get long-term testing year, ok, right? inevitable result allowing go long. needed strict two-month national lockdown. Instead half-assed “lockdown” businesses closed weeks elected officials downplayed virus undermined precautions.

Exactly I’ve saying. think gets worse out.

 believe want “right thing do” might be. end day, reality people large limited patience limited attention span. whole country panicked “locked down” march/April, burned precious patience attention. didn’t get enough - didn’t scale testing enough, didn’t implement robust contact tracing, didn’t reopen proper (or any) precautions. Basically, wasted it. 

And reaping consequences well truly fucked. trudge month 5 living like this, it’s really getting old. Hell, one introverts, I’m someone goes lot, game watch lot Netflix normal times, don’t even many friends. even me, shit really getting old find fantasizing life used be. far I’m concerned, I’ve pushed point now, I’m pretty sure huge majority people past point already too. don’t think another lockdown would damn thing, people simply won’t it. We’ve lost control thing opinion, it’s already over. It’s like we’ve finished tying tracks hear train horn distance. always hear need spurring innovation, kind cool see happen though. mean, I'd rather need first place, alas. Yes, agree. posted, realized figure pulled aforementioned comment hoped someone like would respond. reinfection rate increased factor three 10% people could become reinfected, would certainly epidemiologically relevant implausible given know (that know) disease. 

That uncertainty worry me, however, given numerous worries person confronts every day. Even need managed outside pandemic natural, reasonable allow emotions dictate reality. I'm curious read people ""reinfecfed"" multiple exposures dormant virus DNA.

Shes Rituximab infusions speak. would lie internet? million dollars next week, easy. Ten hand-drawn $100,000 bills, boom. future reference, play mario party..... saw article Alabama doctor saying exact thing yesterday. Good luck fixing willful ignorance. people never going take seriously someone love dies ventilator sadly entirety Southeastern United States huge amount diabetes, obesity, comorbidities generally lead worse outcomes. next month going huge issue South. Alright, fine, may seemed bit hyperbolic. last part wasn’t aimed parent, Trump various parties’ statements.  recently, numbers getting sent directly WHouwse due order spray tan man...... numbers obviously getting meddled with, get released CDC...... numbers used sent directly CDC hospitals..... longer case
..
 continue see mysterious flattening curve regardless cases behaviors getting even riskier...... trust numbers... .trust John Hopkins numbers though.....

Spray tanninator said Eventually right. Spray tan man knows ordered numbers go WHouws... spraytanner wants control numbers say wants..... Worst roommates ever. call abused? Same. first weeks worst going outside working coping method. lockdown happened truly felt awful. Probably worst I've ever felt. Something helped get online course called science well being. requires work omg helped, free.  also think okay say unsafe teachers. Hard argue facts dont line up, huh?  Google cellular immunity. . . I’ll wait 

&amp;#x200B;

then kids getting them. know what? best hospital world, facility, cannot function without disinfection/any form cleaning. THANK YOU! Mine charts March, are. make habit reading sub Good News filter applied, much possible. 

Hang there, find hobby something mind-numbing zone doing, know 100% alone. get this, stay strong. matter around you, remember that. found online learning posted last Spring varied wildly teacher skill digital resources. better others.  pretty poorly implemented. However, mastered little can't learn digital environment. nothing magical building. causes symptoms reinfection. article annoying left important detail. also may body finally clearing viral debris well. neighbor family now. Ok, argued this? really clear masks way fight back 0 clue random reactions people, know spreads breath droplets  kinda not. asked example _when_ tried get tested, situation describing sound like anything recent.

in long run not, no. hence whole ""flattening curve"" philosophy switched realised actual containment longer option. one thing actually compare flu properly. disease people get it. people need get *slowly* properly take care (the ones actually problematic syptoms). diseases *disappear* become wide-spread. become normal part thenworld. develop proper vaccine people also use. Jesus. supposed hate summer months. research back claim? hospitalizations ER visits. short-sighted societal premise society people whatever want harm others environment without facing consequences fail. Everything capitalists America short-sighted thinking long term, long term finally arrives, won’t able handle it.

Let explain - Coronavirus here. Capitalists want send people work deaths try control VIRUS propaganda. don’t even want solve problem. system going collapse, rightly so. one going stand bullshit, workers going end sick dead. addition, virus can’t manipulated brainwashed bit screwed tactics know fight reason.

The capitalist system America failing, it’s fault. destroyed natural consequences actions. well, changed rules.. they're watching sure. vaccine approved wide spread use long might take get enough people vaccinated may achieve herd immunity? pessimistic vaccine, would love true. would think story would everywhere now. wish school liberal. mock exams (of finals) summer break along projects 11 subjects count 20% grade. I'm even sad fact previous batch high schoolers made harder us pushing grade average 91.3%. consider high risk though? BAME community whole considered high risk? 22 year old asthma considered high risk 65 year old underlying issues besides age? remember reading they're hoping 30mil doses September UK, that's almost half population considering many anti-vaxers might able protect everyone wants it. talking president Vietnam? Uganda? Eritrea? Cambodia? country zero deaths Corona? think euphemism ""herd disability""

...which cool. ill March never recovered. Finally making progress steroids, progress, mean walk around block cook meals days. used run strength train.

It's insanity take seriously. still owe 50 dollars first reply, want lose 500? scary, option best can? district budget surplus union feels confident ok, always back mind. CMs training told tell guests guests follow CMs ask guests leave park, nice way saying guests removed park non-compliance.  morgues haven’t overrun since hospitals storing bodies reefer trailers. Also China didn’t know much virus then. assumed bodies burned wouldn’t spread. resulted ordering dead bodies burned, even didn’t die virus, safe. created bottle neck since burials removed equation. know respiratory virus someone dead can’t spread b/c lungs aren’t working.

NYC Wuhan similar size population density. NYC hit hardest videos similar (minus hard lockdown). multiple reports NYC residents hearing ambulance sirens round clock days. Businesses shut early pandemic didn’t see people dying streets way work. people suffering form “happy hypoxia” recently confirmed Covid symptom. blood oxygen level drops carbon dioxide levels don’t go slowly suffocating brain doesn’t know it. Blood O2 80s% gasping air multiple Covid patients hospital recorded 50s-70s% showing signs breathing issues.  Old ppl, healthcare workers, people w high risk complications, rich people first. knows... BioNTech created vaccines, it’s Pfizer’s court actually running trials manufacturing, though suppose that’s similar Moderna NIH Lonza. weird description Disney Corporation. opinion based kids spreading much, place adults ALSO spreading much. 

It's bogus. check oxygen levels home? He's people keeping gone... I've seen, majority hospitalizations sort underlying health issues covid(including obesity). 

There's plenty young people overweight admitted. But, immune system issues begin with. good amount overweight though.

Being overweight definitely favors get covid. really common trope medically awesome sounding headlines written journalists never go anywhere. There’s “cures” cancer reported weekly never seem materialize. People become skeptical medical headlines. unions formed. would courts allow even live school. 10L=1M, same. Indian numbering system. It’s false it’s shown many people minor symptoms (the sniffles) actually plagued months later lasting effects blood clots organ damage caused virus. Minor symptoms viral phase equal “cured day”. missed part said “let’s nothing covid let run rampant.” 

He simply stated trump’s statement correct cases young people don’t produce severe symptoms. Enough straw men feed whole Kentucky derby. Hang there! seek help available, even talking thoughts problems others help &lt;3 wait furloughs.  pretty. I'm quite nervous fall play us. Well, story that.

There concentrated outbreak large Navy barracks outskirts town. Unless close military, happen. spill civil society.

Norway still R0 0.85, pandemic petering out. Breaking news: people sitting restaurant bars day. instead 20 bar/restaurants go 10 restaurants people crowd into. permitted chairs bar owners pushed high top tables bars put chairs next tables. business bumpin!! Curfews assured everyone jams open hours instead spread day. 

Half measures worse measures all.  Wha.... say? know many various medals? 

&amp;#x200B;

no not. I've read 6-10% flu hospitalizations go icu. that, dont recall seeing hospitals overrun flu season.

This info. asking doesnt appear good stats available use arguing people whose IQ 70, nobody going convince change mind. agree - there’s plenty research pointing harms keeping children away school environment extended period even parents best intentions.

If schools open - consider region you’re in, what’s situation contact tracing much virus there, medical evidence factored opening leaders sort? sorts activities planned children? continued learning online lessons social enrichment play?

All things considered it’s still long time vaccine comes. 

To fair - place like New York State opened schools localities others - feel would actually perfectly safe scenario long listen advice. Florida Texas hand 🙈🙉 [Britain pull - realized European country highest number deaths, suspended release official data preparing 'review' data excuse ""A patient tested positive, [was then] successfully treated discharged hospital, still counted Covid death even heart attack run bus three months later"". 

Friendly reminder UK 60,000 excess deaths, 45,000 official covid deaths. According guys, thousands people must recovered covid run bus, guess. Kinds aged 0-9 going without parents rate adults family were. 

Why difficult people like understand? Hope so, I’ll believe happens talked students though? online shit pointless, everyone I’ve talked pass learn fuck all. It’s basically waste time education system look like it’s something us. us need school actually learn subjects, school boards least talked us.  Got beat. city mandated mask yet business enforce. boss said ask want wear mask okay problem. Can't upset customers. Quick Trip gas stations town. isn’t new, merely seasonal cold virus mutated disappears summer, cold viruses — we’re observing globally right now.

/r/agedlikemilk doomers sub always lap negative headlines often completely speculative designed read like fear porn, absolutely refuse accept good news treatments/vaccines like this?

Personally think best manage expectations totally disappointed later on. understand urge hyped good news vaccine development, already see reports reinfections months catching Covid first time.

I realize immunity vaccine catching disease different things, absolutely clue effective long vaccines protect. Thank much. lived would know people wearing masks public mostly tourists around region. time ive left house get groceries goto work 2 hours week. pandemic wouldve ended month 2 ago people wore mask stayed away everyone. hard! think big ideological picture masks become normalized, pandemic it’s measures stop normalized that’s threat systemic order means capitalism know drastically change non-American point view here: tossup. I'd said America heartbeat crisis; I'm sure. I'd still say America's 'western' allies heartbeat though; Canada Poland. TBH end day, fine long widely available everyone get choose. matter neighbor chooses vaccinated long effectively immune. getting sick COVID simply walk doctor's office get vaccinated problem. half country vaccinated end year, enough society essentially return 2019, albeit maybe mask wearing hand sanitizing still cautious. end goal here. 

And yes, know herd immunity works. virus likely going us long time. probably become another yearly vaccine like flu. problem right contagious nobody immunity.  can't make money can't work though... Unless unemployment.

I'm essential work healthcare. 5 yo fully online I'm going quit job...

Not CEOs worried money. people completely ignoring much impact people lower socioeconomic circumstances? lot people currently pushing hard 100% home education usually least *pretend* care things.

Doing classes online home great solution people nice stable homes internet. (I preface saying think schools in-person classes things better). 

Some downsides (and legitimate downsides imo) kids stay home even longer abusive family, lack social interaction, many families access internet, among others. solutions, not.

Edit: read elsewhere reddit someone said “there winners” honestly, completely agree. schools person, risk death infections high, but, schools continue remain home, likely hold trashy abusive parents harming child increased. obviously wider scale problem cannot ignored. analogy still doesn’t work, FYI. doesn’t matter color hard-to-get stain is, needs extra attention same. stain needs extra attention, needs extra attention, regardless color, shape, etc. Sorry, didn’t realize different person claims vented masks block water droplets. I’d interested sources either way I've stuck bed since March. 4 months developed viral meningitis. I'm finally somewhat better dexamethasone I'm blessed good PCP give time day. neurologist tried diagnose ptsd, anxiety, lying smoking weed, prescribed deep breathing. Yeah, ok.

It horrifies people take seriously places. I'm fortunate kids take care of. I'm 30s fit hell this.

Fingers crossed slow recovery permanent disability. Probably public ones cancelled.

If ya can't go public fireworks show might well buy own

The problem fireworks, problem people probably invited friends family We've talked ""office"" (quotes office online meetings) vaccine found thing cured, V-Day like celebration. Complete sailors kissing nurses streets. USA bungling coronavirus response really playing long game eh? Meanwhile Ron DeSantis told state little transmissibility children adults fine open schools. 

What fucking mess. kid came nurse crapped pants diarrhea way school. smelled absolutely wretched. asked happened, said hold dad get work. asked could borrow spare sweatpants keep nurse's office day. Turned he'd diarrhea night shocker 24 hour stomach bug gone yet. make matters worse kid nurse's skinned knee playing blacktop school witnessing whole thing. kid started calling ""dookie pants"" name stuck. mad kids parents many reasons. American perspective, you’ve hit nail motherfucking head Great News. Hopefully world come together manufacturing distribution. (if already) start discussions distribution channels remove red tape. first responders countries get first preference. No. toot. homeschooling hard parents gone working. i'm glad ok letting poorer children get behind education. talk privilege. Thank link!  Chris Wallace decent Fox News anchor. Yeah going big issue. Even Oxford vaccine meets wildly optimistic September date, there’s going massive production distribution effort, going people refuse take it, going limits efficacy. It’s going magic wand, there’s real risk totally unnecessary deaths people treat way.  value federal reserve currency based mostly faith. US dollar backed anything tangible theory could ""print"" unlimited amount money long countries still faith buying power would stave inflation.

This way complex explained it, I'm writing book Reddit explain current global financial valuations. Adults spreading either. virus spreading 1.0 there. 

I understand people like live trying mislead people like this. sound sleeper. someone ""other side,"" deeply disturbed see friends family. can't wrap mind around attitudes ideologies manifest response threat posed pathogen. incredibly disappointing. hope find within come together conquer thing. right wrong- Humanity future species. evidence always there- right front eyes. continues pile along bodies. Every day becomes worst last pandemic accelerates beyond possibility control. defining moment world history.

Whoever are, wherever are- whatever affiliations are- hope prepping. one human another, wish family well. We've still got long road ahead us. ""convincing"" people- I'm sad say, see experience themselves. sincerely hope rest us unite instead tearing apart. Well said. great ted talks already watched. important interesting topic. Dining dangerous. Social distancing going work area people talking without wearing masks. body produces saliva eat droplets. air re-circulated probably remnants droplets.

A night literally gambling life lives around you. USA terrible handling things like personal leave sick leave. Even “good job” often can’t afford take days off. national policy/mandate provide good numbers days workers.  Live Milwaukee. People walk stores take masks chin. hope stores making regular put someone charge reminding customers wear it. Right one really enforcing it. Hey guys! live Vermont everyone know wearing masks still social distancing. Treatment solve everything many die home, knowing covid - treatment available would meaningless them. Vaccine much better option. Actual fact: prove covid. False negative case. something else need long term treatment? US temporary disability, usually results idiots accusing everyone needs abusing system, least something. course nothing virus ends lungs inhaling it. also help prevent spreading others.

Just wear mask FFS. Many said masks distancing required :( Young people work service jobs come contact large amounts people pay rent savings.

Do pack bars hold coronavirus parties intentionally invite infected people? Every highly developed capitalist country seemed figure out.

The problem capitalism, American style unrestrained capitalism. lied directly American people one making up. It’s fact. Well good thing falls contagious exponential growth like C19 then. Keep good work, VT! Perhaps ""others"" mask? bored

Bored people dangerous people. noticed since people wearing masks stores putting signs, people entering without masks. braved going Dollar Tree day man stood front door, seemingly perplexed sign saying masks required, watched couple people go masks, left. Can’t say every person inside wearing masks correctly every person mask everyone’s mouth covered. (Except one employee pulled moving something- water leaking roof trying get area control). 

So least step right direction, though it’s ridiculous we’re far still trying get people wear masks public. employer doesn’t give sick paid leave I’m forced come office. Even I’m sick corona. Bills don’t care sickness! Might enlight data? Gilead trial limitations mostly reduced length stay tested ICU patients. best understanding single drug tested mild cases. would sure give drug considerable side effects quite unobtainable point mild cases decent chance requiring hopsital care. think America, concept theory, tremendous potential live ""city hill"" myth led believe grade school. We're fucking selfish right people let happen. Wtf talking about, ethnic cleansing? referring user computed amount reinfections now, using number infections 3 months ago, number reinfections today probability getting infected now. simplification, sure, result clearly line reports gotten last week reinfections. Freedumb difficult situation. 

As someone US, know handful families parents would lose jobs nowhere send kids, school otherwise. 

This comment meant productive critical, I’m venting really shitty. Merv 13 material amazon. Aerostar sells - used to. bought create filters pure water-tank venting system, sell people make masks it. Aerostar make furnace filters. Merv 13 blocks particles like bacteria viruses (apparently). may like try something like that. certainly driving factor. florida median age cases 60s april. seem like ability get different age, almost entirely skew based testing availability now, yes. started 1 person that’s would take surge - 1 person coming back Florida vacation visiting relatives Texas. bear shits woods I’ve seen well around Gadsden. It’s weird, machista thing. 😂😂 Vaccine works even months enough get control. find dose regime administering give protection. panic vaccines this. also means vaccine unlikely.

The approach always been: lock reduce cases, test, contact trace, quarantine. Rinse repeat.

When case counts gets low enough, continue mask use social distancing, cases pop up: see above. Technically Bush started playbook 2005. think exponential spread, testing, etc, could see 100k dead per month awhile. Thoughts? Good job Vermont! Hope us New York follows degree. Better look vaccines work, protect  inducing effector mechanisms (cells molecules) capable  rapidly controlling replicating patho-gens inactivating toxic components. Vaccine-induced immune effectors (Table 2.1)  essentially antibodies—produced  B lymphocytes—capable  binding specifically  toxin  pathogen.  Denial reality. Even hospital, risk nasty annoying complication worth it. cells dumb figure replicate virus point *perceived* severity disease reduced existence cure. fucking serious True, people use Snap Chat 99% morons. Last heard Evers considering expects state Supreme Court toss like safer-at-home order. caveat conservatives court 5-2 majority time (one conservative sided Evers time making ruling 4-3) drops 4-3 conservative majority August 1st one justices voted overturn safer-at-home order losing seat liberal.

So far Dane County (where Madison located) city Milwaukee firm mandates fines violators. others ""recommend"" teeth enforce basically means they're worthless. guess would statewide mask mandate issued early August followed Republican controlled legislature suing governor we'll get see sincere conservative justice flipped really was. Cronyism inevitable path capitalism treads Omg thats really horrible, hope get worked quickly, everything clogged right :( critical thinking skills, truth often self evident. unfortunate enough educated USA past 25 years, absence said skills leaves open believing propagating old horse shit. Schooling person won’t last long fall. teachers sick possibly lengthy time. enough subs go around. teachers died summer schooling even full amount students. gotten sick can’t return without feeling somewhat healthy again. Buckle ya’ll, fall going interesting. keep wishing would mutate give us buttworms. feel like high enough disgust factor. People want buttworms. Gasping breathe abstract, guess. Spicy. Looney tunes Well high UV index FL kills virus quickly.

But hot fuck everyone's indoors.    Best luck you. fully understand saying. Stay safe ignorant comment. oxygen gets mask. cherry pick want truth masks causing hypoxia. find proof true. Go buy oxi monitor stick probe mask 100% verifiable truth. drop dangerous levels. weird. number looks high doesn’t mean it’s ludicrous (that would Fallacy Personal Incredulity btw) look calculations based see assumptions were. numbers cite assume 65% population gets infected eventually (based happens influenza epidemics, bad starting point) 0.8% mortality, still decent mortality estimate (they probably based Diamond Princess data, still thorough closed-population study held pretty well).

We’re still anywhere near peak pandemic remains seen final total be. improved treatments give hope mortality rate come quite bit, even still entails lot ICU cases, medical debt, long-term complications etc. Anyway, continues unchecked USA rest year (as seems likely), several hundred thousand deaths seem likely. see maybe reaching half million end year. Beyond depends get vaccine. makes sense, diet canada boss spouse thought Covid hoax till got got severely ill still suffer on. still difficult time respecting people common sense believe medical experts versus Narcissistic political figures. family friend circle gotten much smaller needless say. Get n95 add ""not smell people"" list pros. Great point! gave 11 yr old daughter choices, chose go back physical school follow safety guidelines. think windows kids schools *can* even open. 

I know safety/security reasons what. manage buildings 1000 2000 kids inability open windows this? case DeWitt NY? sure mom child spreader? definitely concerning like you, I'm erring side caution sending kids school. feel like lot articles big question marks. 

It hurts ""our"" credibility logical underpinning little loose. big part questioning, too, cite Trump fan I'd hope able throw back airtight answer. Actual fact: get false negative test result. happening 3rd world country, US would sent it’s evil freedom already. I'm North Carolina. heard discussion here, though wish come up. one worthy compromises I've heard makes sense. worry young children asymptomatic spreaders homes though. I'm convinced one way data that's come far, I'm sure we'll plenty data soon. Yeah think New York numbers far looking good forget winter driving people indoors northern cities. We'll seeing similar spikes Texas, Arizona, Florida come winter. especially bad schools businesses reopen.  people really think gets approved world isn’t going go fucking sonic speed trying distribute ? want normalcy ASAP. would take vaccine made people knew contaminated talcum powder giving women ovarian cancer nothing actually quoting Senator Bill Cassidy Louisiana, Dr. Fauci. googled quote listed since link it. Fauci actually said something closer to, that's really tough, lot factors play. virtually at Senate committee hearing, Fauci said federal officials aware “unintended deleterious consequences children school,” didn’t easy way address them.
“It’s obviously difficult,” said. “I don’t good explanation solution problem happens close schools triggers cascade events.”
He responding Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, offered lengthy list concerns. Children school, Cassidy noted, “potentially away enhanced nutrition, without parent able work school provides daycare, without monitoring sometimes occurs incidences child abuse, perhaps importantly children, opportunity cost brain forming access information help brain form optimally.”

“Has kind risk-benefit ratio child?” asked.*  thoughts, doesn’t even good stuff. UTZ it’s at. So, Trump DeSantis supporting family Miami opening church public today I'm beside myself. They're epicenter disease they're going congregating 2 hours elderly churchgoers. I've pleaded relentlessly downplay virus stop reckless, keep arguing democratic hoax mess election.

I fear little old ladies :( American society pediatricians disagrees recommends school openings safeguards. unfortunate gotten politicized removed ability people think critically dig pro anti Trump position. Trump said anything feel people would thinking ways open schools. generation youth getting lower quality education one big deal. countries opened schools, done state Massachusetts would predict happen. infection dose? whole mask ""problem"" would cease concept shared masks help Eh. unless common. Even true case reinfection, still quite rare. Remembr dozens millions people infected virus without reinfection tests notoriously faulty early areas low prevalence.

People subreddit latch stories like due confirmation bias, clear bias overall entertain worst case scenarios. really funny pro-science subreddit claims support wishful thinking. relied solely antibodies type immunity, humans would’ve died long time ago. Original Chicago even new, doctors China warning mask valves since January. don’t understand everyone believed Chinese officials fake data ignored doctors advice. Remember, Trump said couple months ago suffered less 100k deaths, “done good job”.  thing

its always necessary true. kind behavior gets ingrained you. disincentives staying home, adults telling stay home responsible thing, led believe must weak can't power it.

I unlearn like year two working fulltime. got sick basically told go home. paid sick leave too. Yup. Chicken pox side effects kids leaves risk shingles get older. know risks Covid 19 cause kids grow older. Much like shingles may health issues pop kids Covid 19 much older. would give DeSantis free pass cruelty assuming he’s stupid, Trump is? Sorry say, able go CDC data Information Already Disappearing Trump Shifts Control CDC’s COVID Tracker Disappears Day Trump Administration Takes Control Case one test. need two tests sure. lot false positives covid PCR tests. Wow. fuck would known human beings human beings!!?!??? Mmmm would. can't good faith voting system says 49% majority exactly 100% majority. There's room moderates. 'murica, fuck yeah! Thousands upvotes hour. Phish definitely saved vermont responding silly argument. Pro-Death Party Thank reading. Elementary kids could certainly prioritized getting back school, getting back school can't prioritized human lives. probably means one two days class per week per student, staggered start/end times, waiting case rates low region. best think drinking water urine, quite possible already inhaled molecule breathed Hitler. You’d think half days summer ninety degrees think still happening? /r/coronavirus? explain low new cases Mass NJ, also populated urban centers? Thanks, got it. Vermont US's New Zealand? Would interesting find organized it. Hahahahaaha AMERICA BABY Comfort arrived March 30th. Cuomo's order March 25 repealed May 10th. Comfort arrived well hospitals capacity. Doubling 6 days time hospital capacity expected exceeded around April 7th. Cuomo's order directly prohibited nursing homes refusing patients based COVID-19 status. Nursing homes say could handle it, actively rejecting patients making stay hospitals thats made order. 

CDC guidelines nursing homes accept patients could follow isolation guidelines. literally document linked comments went based cdc nursing homes said could handle it

There nothing true, nursing homes ""said could handle it"" voluntarily accepting patients would need make executive order make illegal nursing homes reject COVID patients??

There nursing home administrators news time trying fight order.

They use federal capacity rejecting every effort Trump would saved lives. Instead stupid shit like going CNN arguing would need 30K ventilators. Even though already figured intubating people done way frequently oxygenated blood transfers much effective safer. true, northeast, rates falling. boasted 1.4% rate today, first example. Pool testing feasible states low rates, handful those. life. Mask protect dont protect whatsoever. like trying stop .mosquito chain link armor Hey - workin' irony angle.
 
My bad. news April? American officials alarmed fake text messages social media posts said President Trump locking country. Experts see convergence Russian tactics.

Have laugh. multiple people swear “friend military” told time. One boss. set urban-legend radar hard, tried pin people exactly heard (usually said “you read Facebook, right?”) got evasive.

Being able sort bullshit non-bullshit great talent many ways, it’s also depressing hell. 

( foreign plot, make people look dumb.) protects others *more*, exclusively. 

Imagine Covid19. sneeze you. Would rather wearing mask, reduces amount viral load going breathe/swallow, would rather none?

So means immunity, even simplest cotton mask zero protection. fortunate Vietnam moment ! People government worked together war Covid-19 . American could better place :-). link said 20% New York died Nursing Home deaths case.? Thats almost 50 percent less national average. alot middle aged people dieing? I’m confused say. ""we""? game?

It's humanity vs virus. team that, fuck you. Well, senators it’s one one I. State legislature D, governor R. Party lines don’t mean nearly much Vermont national stage.

We’ve got factors helping idea Trump better suited manage Hilary ridiculous. literally relevant experience, respect science, desire listen experts ever. Doesn’t read, wasn’t well informed current events, etc. Idk you’d think random guy reality tv would well suited manage complex international disaster.

When you’re dealing something like pandemic want someone understands government works effective there. might like policies, think evidence points listening experts, respecting science, letting CDC it’s job, etc. exactly operated throughout whole career. mask selection (U.S.) sucks.  


I've lived overseas mask-wearing countries, I've seen pages better choices Taobao. Fitted masks customizable covers filters. try find anything Amazon sports gear, often ugly wrap-around strap.  


Some mask company needs hire me. Almost 260,000 new cases 24 hours. 


The total number confirmed cases coronavirus passed 14 million Saturday, 600,000 recorded deaths, according tally kept US-based Johns Hopkins University. Reading article, seems Dr. Fauci saying New York’s approach reopening model rest country, handling entire crisis now. missing something? bout fucking smart it? isn’t black white man. shit isn’t binary. fuck load countries reduced spread virus inching back normal. United States accelerating wall dumb dumbs like looking current situation shallow sense. 

Look know you’re either trolling trying push narrative. Maybe you’re dumb, doubt it. comments like frustrating people actually think even iota common sense. Oh totally agree cute hen put global context point ruralness what's protecting us covid19, even fraction rural states west are, like NM, NV, MN, WY, etc. ruralness protecting us, states far rural us would lot better time.

Wyoming smaller population, twice many cases. And, no, cases concentrated Cheyenne. *All* states rural us cases per capita. Cases higher urban areas, that's true Vermont, too. Sorry slow response, took bit find original article since time since read it. is:
 secondary source author good job providing links original research whenever possible, interested! Ajam... ehm... remind loooot space race? im confused? 930 people die every year Orange Country unintentional falls


http://www.ochealthiertogether.org/tiles/index/display?alias=leadingcauses lets hope part 99.9% right? That's point. saying needs say get gullible parents onboard, truth damned. pandemic scare people away beaches, think wimpy sharks going scare off? weapons grade stupidity we're dealing here. washing balls right now? Thanks reposting! However, width epidemic curve exactly earlier winter influenza curves previous seasons Europe, different countries different responses (see country-level data, instance). duration seems robust affected measures. countries do, appears, limit mortality shield at-risk individuals (in care homes, example, primary drivers COVID mortality). theory, houses controlled Republicans. That's like hoping Mitch McConnell stop Trump Trumping. going happen. wow fuck trump. hasnt point might well get ass behind wheel. Octopus family lol border America SEALED.

It though. Unfortunately they're letting people drive Alaska. Wow relief. WH gain killing citizens workforce? nation earth thing right now? I'm 70 now, still waiting Russia make announcement believe. sad truth America needs couple politicians celebrities die horrifically prove full shit covid real. Till continue downplay this. would also depend whether fish etc carry virus. fortunately seem case both, though protects others quite bit you. story still self-goal he's anti-mask, means he's encouraging others bother, including around him, would probably include whoever, know, transmitted virus him.

In mask-wearing state, would less likely contract it. he's done even minimum protect anyone else OK, surprise, contracts himself. Americans make easy targets kind action. zones out, prideful acknowledge got played. could attempt point geographic extents vs. cultural ones, conversation work culture seems like weird distinction trying draw first peak April hard cap 35k cases/day due testing limitations.  know recovering make immune, right? US thankfully, hope get control soon Consider joining /r/testandtrace stay date contact tracing efforts help build support programs community. It’s bit small right nonetheless useful sub. Duh I've lived Vermont life, asshole. Man, almost like great artists writers written cultural spiritual sickness pervasive modern societies may something. moron acts like he's fighting terrorists. virus care scared. Jesus Florida shit. Musk absolutely swimming antibody transfusions. He's safe. Ruby Waves get us through! #I’m Ideas guess don’t need science. need Jesus. American! Yuck! I'm reading article referenced. know went quoting Adrian Zenz overthrow groups like UHRP primary source I'm seeing took pictures buildings built. Gasp. Suppose take batshit one million people prison number (derived NED interviewing exactly 8 people outside china), that's 1/3 incarcerated people vs US. per capita, total, US 1/5 Chinas population. Nice! Real Americans nothing learn liberal hellhole like New York. assume talking America? ""bunkering place"" (whatever fuck is)

It's like sheltering place, potatoes canned food. Watch news. American news. Several news stations reporting mysterious SARS-like virus starting spread far back November. Rural areas bag risk even density lower. People older conditions cause complications. fewer gas stations &amp; stores everyone interacts *everyone* meeting points community. (at least Oregon) don’t enough funds, medical supplies, beds handle outbreak. Agreed places opened even earlier Wow, complete moron. Divisive one corona NY country, they'd worst world mortality. literally dragged entire USA level France. comparison, Texas 4x lower USA average, around level Germany. See ok, rurality meaningless terms fight covid19. whole point.

if rurality protecting us, sure shit would protecting states extremely rural us. Back first peak April , seeing 35k+ cases day 2000 deaths. come time deaths much lower way cases? know there's lag, weeks increase now. different time? acquire American Companies Can't time governor trial impeachment, lieutenant governor becomes acting governor."" there’s tests there’s cases. It’s control narrative. confirm, lived Quebec early march, fucked. two treatments helping experience? Godspeed efforts frontline. ""I would buying house Canada moving""

Sure would nice option us. going second part documentary: Idiocracy ? 
At first funny, getting really dark? directing? Adam Sandler? Greatest live band time

That would Grateful Dead Phish indeed amazing To- officials, Huh? whole point rurality what's protecting us covid19, given plethora states *objectively* *SIGNIFICANTLY* rural us. redditors thread massively overselling rural factor.  Covid free we’re not. lack knowledge 

I’m one cited source people young unhealthy thin

Most fat. least lack empathy 

I empathy people health problems didn’t choose half decade left live begin with. see *source* posted. shows good stage anyway. what’s point virtue signaling? quoting song lyrics Phish touching conversation. Sincerely. 

^(But still write walls text/no paragraphs like crazy person and/or David Foster Wallace) It’s nice meet you. like say 90% before, yes, like you, hiking capacity 50% February. Trying things get better. Every decision makes reelected. trying minimize numbers hoping Oxford saves him. time covid reelection went positive jobs report end May believe. needs numbers look less keeping unemployment ok avoiding lockdowns hope miracle vaccine. block them. Idiots worth time energy.  thinks badge honor.  tool. I've read bit spread SARS-1 spread Vietnam, somewhat possible, seems highly unlikely. total number confirmed cases 63, international organizations credit Vietnam first country world contained eliminated it. Although higher fatality rate, also lower transmission rate, quarantine procedures implemented back likely prevented ever spreading far. Aren’t adults technically older children? Why? I'm Covid free. seriously, look lies. going share politifact could take look say trump? like right 45 lie.  think lose focuses issues rial base ones drive away moderates non-trump supporting conservatives needs win. handled corona much better election hopes would much higher. Trump egotistical incompetent see Fields, mate worry, I'm eliminating nonessential parties limiting essential partying only. concerning, well timed lockdown may best way get virus fairly neutered.

Try light measures, it'll burn nearly whole graph citizens relatively quickly.

Let burn week hard, hitting highly connected nodes (super spreaders/most popular people), lock down, end immunity. ease up, relatively light measures keep spread slow burn.

Could explain places like NY Bergamo seeming success keeping bay, whilst even similar mask compliance could difficulty areas lock *after* moderate surge.

Theory, anyway. time like 1 10 people infected got tested. much better. happy peer reviewed double blind studies confirm ""known forever"". Even get literature review it. This. Snapchat stories full people birthday party’s literal weddings well 50 people attending. Gets harder harder every day justify letting mental health completely erode isolation past 4 months went small gathering first time months. friend's birthday party feel guilty. best maintain distance know enough. steps take home ensure Mom get anything might carrying? considering wearing mask anytime room.

Thanks Mass NJ fewer 500 new cases day. FL TX 10k day. think population explains different rates new cases   areas. TX Mass 10-20 times population Mass NJ.  song? May see connection (though [don't] see it, stare) 9000 Dark triad...  Vermont strange. democratic house senate including Sanders also republican Governor, spread educated population culture socially distances without pandemic. Yeah, it’s extremely bad summer. Especially outdoors front - hikes area super saturated tourists 3rd world ruined nations aren’t going produce anything except propaganda. Holy shit! buddy sent one those. girlfriend's friends aunt sent several folks eventually got him. guy loves conspiracy theories.........

Dude legit thought martial law going happen, closing coastlines whatever crazy shit texts. sent 1 2 time beginning pandemic. like dude..... need chill fuck stop spreading shit around. Living North Carolina. confirm, exception grocery stores. guys put man moon 60's

They believe either. Young people? Last time checked, people charge could actually something situation old. fact, ""leaders"" oldest world. coincidence also first governor host/attend Trump rally. Yeah like half friends road tripping across entire fucking country right now. Dumbasses. [Vermont becomes state nation without death COVID-19 past 30 Wait New York state put infected people nursing homes? That's correct thing do? Yep they’re clumsy According link, deaths actually occurred around May. time, unless I’m mistaken, overwhelmingly affecting VA nursing homes (accounting 55% deaths time think)- nursing homes expensive, overwhelmingly affect white families. nursing homes general majority white.

Deaths also lag behind case numbers, cases started severely spiking recently- likely weeks, minimum, accurate picture. Actual death rate may already lower, slightly better understanding treatment did, help some. won’t really know later, accurate scope what’s happened, timing, demographics. big difference though. People work cause job important still done something occurs every country. People work due poverty since otherwise could longer provide families something occur countries good social security system / good government reaction crisis hence useful relief programs poor people pandemic. American officials alarmed fake text messages social media posts said President Trump locking country. Experts see convergence Russian tactics.

This rumor going around online first real quarantine March.

Article April.

OP trying stir anti-China sentiment mask mandate largest city major outbreak began. early stages actually highest death rate days. series deaths nursing homes elder rehabs. heartbreaking. live densely populated city VT. Bars reopened summer camps happening. expect resurgence pretty soon. Bars around packed everyone hanging around patio without masks smoking. US actually took messages seriously, people would back living normally like China. Middle-age people (unless they're total Karens) wear masks really flaunt social media. elderly folks wear masks...well, doubt even Instagram Tik Tok.

Singling young people feels odd statistics wise, absolutely every age group % anti-maskers. Holy shit Florida ate almost like value intelligence. Cases manufactured depending political affiliation good luck    legal, nasty yet unharmful way mess that. 

My immediate thought training dog aggressively hump legs, I'm creative. 

Too bad can't charge admission street something. bet name major US political parties; can’t name either ones mentioned. actually depresses little. Thank :3 lack large cities? states cities reach even 100k population, Delaware much worse Vermont.  laugh irony saying 45-50 years ago. Bravo NYers

Honestly, congested apartment buildings public transport.. time HIV new virus caused aids, im sure 5 months discovery people concerned kids getting AIDs. years later know would terrible thing. article came JAMA recently indicated fertility issues recovered men, know cause heart, lung, kidney, and, almost 50% time hospitalized patients, brain issues persist recovery. 

I think gambling childs adulthood worth it. Exactly. pandemic exposed mass stupidity selfishness. I'm flabbergasted. Arizona Vermont. run unintelligent people, elected angry uneducated voters. luxury non-tourist state. patent 100% released many companies begin production. 

It’s unbelievable happening. Same, used retail manager. Wear mask MAGA hat together really keep distance. equivalent 47 9/11 combined. lot put us moon well educated immigrants, former Nazi scientists.

We still advantages we've squandering ever since Hitler put goober explody-end. NY, lowest these, 19M people. NJ 8M Mass online almost 7M. Scientists changed minds recommended face masks since February.

Non-experts still changed minds one reason another. Actually, can't place straight casket. apparently still infectious need wrapped twice like. Documentary process working? 

Live central many wearing masks. Oh yeah? good stories?

I'm still sort surprised Trump pardoned yet, massive distraction and, um, red meat base. No. Morons like gonna fucking ruin state virus ravages us November increased tourism, lack mask mandate, schools opening back up.

*We fucking special.* like many others get inflated ego cases low far. *asinine* disregard caution what's screwed much world. need take seriously, risk significant.

Don't make Boyd died nothing. Cases damn near 100x March. want get habit sitting car funerals. (old) article isn’t virus per se, it’s online rumor months ago trump would start martial law. eff move Vermont? accept Oregonians? I’m 30. single 23, would risk assessment behaviour young people demonstrates tolerance risk. It’s easy three months summer time rationalize behaviour. Human beings selfish, appreciate expectations taken them. think it’s rational behaviour, it’s behaviour helps keep virus bay. put shoes come conclusions. Mandatory police issue though fines. Europe fuck around.

After one wants American situation here. Yeah, needed 1 news item 4 people different households sharing car go shopping getting fined 1200€...

The people still thinking virus hoax know dutch fines hoax... idea, I'm experienced matter, I've hearing lot doctors know treat better. know now. Many hospitals automatically use blood thinners reduce clotting, example. little. grand tradition sucking oil industry electing blowhards.  Wishful thinking mate. countrys propaganda falling apart.

All film's show great guys would handle kind situations complete lie. US completely botched laughing stock world.

Not true, we're laughed at...The world taking pity us Hey talk ""good christian"" overlords like that!! New York's death toll stands stand far Florida's precisely reason. hardly ""did right"". viewers masked experience Parisian transport mean like everywhere. actually found 99% people transport wearing masks (source : user ligne 13, ligne 1, bus 31, transilien, TGV)
Saying that, agree enforcing mandatory rules. True, true. right that.

It's especially important case, though, guy wear mask, he's governor refused impose mask mandates state, generally discouraged them, meaning he's responsible increasing number maskless people around him, meaning... well, see mean. Australia gotten new cases 300 day last checked. 3000 current cases. 120 total deaths since start.

We population 25 million think comparable lot states US I've even people stop car middle road, get take pictures. annoying anything headline inaccurate? I'm sure implying. I've spent lot time four states. Well said.

People never seen vast open spaces West find difficult imagine. experts advise mean understands advise, understands believe inconvenient worldview. Unfortunately everyone country, idiot-in-chief one charge crisis, already let grow point probably least order magnitude worse Chernobyl. icing cake corona outbreak render ground occurs uninhabitable thousand years. Fuck don’t even remember post was. Anyways 2 weeks eventually caught up. Deaths didn’t follow though. dis guy married Would rather California right New York, trend lines quite different.

New York massive curve flatten, did, great cost. states still building first peak, yet opening anyway. There’s people throwing raves Columbus going mean, anyone tried yet? could onto something. /s Narcissistic injury.

This I've afraid whole time. take offense feel bad. meaning towards ""Don't talk know."" came jerk. nothing wrong. &lt;3 slight breach protocol, sailed right past double-dog-dare, straight TRIPLE-dog-dare! Fauci: “also whole state Wisconsin” Yeah. Doctors still working. Telling people many additional patients really serve anything 7 days week.  dont care US, Russia, China, Germany Ethiopia comes vaccine. cheer whoever gets vaccine first long make available everyone regardless from. People thinking sort competition see country greater, maybe dont get vaccine then, us want cure. Sad 😞 I’m sure is, extent. live ""village"" population 105k. 

Just thinking it, could easily get VT's 600k population city's population nearest 4 neighbors. Republicans hate idea masks actively think suppressing population, mask wearing looks similar get triggered. Even though nothing suppression. Projection, war words lot closer ""we wear masks test trace keep bars closed"" versus ""fake news can't tell do!"" Im spread anti immigrant rhetoric, make friends! thing anymore companies governments need implement better paid sick leave policies two things. First, personally, I'm still I'm supposed to. I'm masking up, I'm going buy food work, unless exercise. behavior changed initial wave ""we're together"" stuff initially came modified exercise patterns, stopped rock climbing restricted local trails, I've rolled back evidence mounts outdoor transmission concern I've sort decided everyone else whatever want driving hour ride bike probably going breaking point here.
Second, I'm going call ""no better than"" false equivalence, reread list things wrote think important life experiences, half semester college, internships, careers starting remember half boomers protesting wanting hair cut. I'm going hold friends might go bars month equivalent protesters they're unwise thing they're legally allowed do. It’s kids 10 appear spread less adults. article says doesn’t take account asymptomatic kids common. 
Ie: kids get sick Correctamundo point ruralness unique special.

NV extreme case dichotomy urban rural. states population centers higher case counts coupled abundance cases country side... including vermont. there's absolutely reason believe virus ""contained"" chittenden/burlington way ""contained"" vegas reno.

that population evenly distributed works us; isolated enough virus stopped dead tracks edges pop. centers. can't go 5 minutes driving around without seeing another house person. rural absolutely nothing like NV's rural, really anywhere west. facile beyond belief conflate them.

in case... *moderately low* density going mean jack fucking shit tourism starts... time schools start... paid family/medical leave... without mask mandate. manchester's crowded city I've ever leaves change. dumbasses thread downvoting know first damn thing vermont. fetishize us 'cuz voted bernie sanders stupid shit think we're *oh special* smart rational we'll safe forever. Thankfully I’m college student Similar boat here. comes waves; feeling I’m missing sort super fun times. However end day elders life feel responsible well. 
Meh  Yeah would really like see New England area cases settle down. rely heavily visitors seasons here, especially winter. everyone would wear mask could looking lot better moving Fall. Wrong again.

The Chinese tried, still trying (for obvious reasons, SARS-COV IFR frightning). fair, spring really wasn’t pretty lot schools trying adapt. Even then, lot students still idea heads online school next years gonna last year, thus lot students want go back in-person instruction avoid it. Plus, there’s problem (at least) small portion students significantly worse online setting dislike online together (regardless it’s polished cobbled e-learning system), they’d also pushing in-person school. hope never something drastically similar think people die something right to. still can't wrap head around people think deserve simultaneously believing others deserve basic human rights... surprising news, ice cold, fire burns, Vladimir Putin May ties Russia. “O.H.”

“I.O.”

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Sounds lot like World War Z too. I'm still mad even though obviously worse things worry now. seems gotten skin. even masks, social distancing, shutting economy. Imagine many fewer flu deaths we'd everyone worn masks stayed home! hence Biden's 10-15 point lead states like Texas coming play. Even paid people stay home, they'd still go out.  get participation award disinfection? know doesn’t count like high five something would cool Fair enough.

Edit: Although really understand *how* immune system deals wity efficiently, one hypothesis precisely contract common colds often stronger immunity coronaviruses.

Person gets vaccinated doesn’t get covid. go see immune compromised relative either isn’t able vaccinated due pre existing condition vaccine didn’t work. Since person vaccinated worked don’t spread covid relative. Person B doesn’t get vaccinated contracts covid asymptomatic. Since don’t know sick go visit immune compromised relative isn’t protected spreads relative gets sick dies. Um. statistics long-term damage young people. know cause permanent lung damage, brain damage weaken months. know many percent 35 affected. that's I'm worried about, there's data. I'm you. find something positive take day day.  


I've stressed got case shingles. We've isolating taking precautions months - everyone else area treat like nothing cases since exploded.  feel like prisoner, trapped home without end sight.  know end eventually, hopefully sooner later. hold hope years it'll seem like distant memory. 3 month old, I'd say sound like taking right precautions go ahead. personally, want take risks young baby.

If prepared quarantine 14 days get home see daughter (independently test results could provide false results) could okay. OH Man? plenty evidence China's approach squashing virus near zero BETTER economy countries try juggle reopening rising cases. US midst large wave cases/deaths across multiple states stopped reopening tracks. New restrictions restaurants, bars shops already place, may well another round lock certain places. Even Spain, Germany, etc., still whack-a-mole hundreds new daily cases. Barcelona locked Japan, Australia, Israel second waves. Meanwhile, Vietnam, China (the vast majority it), Thailand, New Zealand, etc., well. China reported 3.2% quarterly growth. countries V-shaped recoveries.

The fact soon things return normal, cases grow exponentially. matter time things situation gets control. Best squash zero possible. not, numbers squashed level low takes least 5 6 exponential cycles detect again. numbers low, contact tracing targeted approaches like localized lock downs. Countries like US simply lost control. even clear whether situation salvaged reaching 'herd immunity' enormous human cost. need, look nothing FL still tons body bags left. Yes. keeping inside 3 months incredibly difficult them. exciting new treatment option perhaps ready vaccines. downvoted? really accurate metric though. Nevada, Arizona, etc many people metro areas giant swaths nothing balance out. Overall de facto way densely populated Vermont.

Wyoming, sure. New Mexico, kind of, also pretty big city insane rural poverty led bad outbreaks. Fell it! upvote!

That I'm asking better combatting covid US? maybe report numbers? maybe healthy general (not obese etc) Man that's odd. article indicating third children tested positive COVID-19.

Here's title: Nearly one-third children tested COVID Florida positive. Palm Beach County’s health director warns risk long-term damage

The content: 

Nearly one-in-three children tested new coronavirus Florida positive, South Florida health official concerned disease could cause lifelong damage even children mild illness.

Dr. Alina Alonso, Palm Beach County’s health department director, warned county commissioners Tuesday much unknown long-term health consequences children catch COVID-19.

X-rays revealed virus cause lung damage even people without severe symptoms, said.

“They seeing damage lungs asymptomatic children. ... don’t know going manifest year two years now,” Alonso said. “Is child going chronic pulmonary problems not?”

Her comments stand contrast Gov. Ron DeSantis’ messaging children low risk, classrooms need reopened fall. DeSantis said would comfortable sending children school old enough attend.

Some studies suggest children less likely catch COVID-19 adults. Children also far less likely die disease. 17,000 Florida’s roughly 287,800 cases people younger 18. 4,514 COVID-19 deaths reported Florida Tuesday, four younger 18.

Still, it’s possible COVID-19 could long-term consequences take time understand, Alonso said.

“This virus bring everybody together make sure catch get with,” said. “This something serious, learning new information virus every day.”

State statistics also show percentage children testing positive much higher population whole. Statewide, 31% 54,022 children tested positive. state’s positivity rate entire population 11%.

Researchers linked serious potentially deadly inflammatory condition COVID-19 children. condition, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, doesn’t appear widespread. Florida Department Health lists 13 confirmed cases syndrome.

Dr. Jorge Perez, co-founder Kidz Medical Services, said it’s early say common severe long-term damage could COVID-19, early evidence suggests children infected virus could lasting damage.

“We learning something every day,” said Perez, operates pediatric offices throughout South Florida. “We knowledgeable continue monitor see effects children.”

DeSantis told talk radio host Rush Limbaugh last week risk children “very low.”

“I’ve got 3-year-old daughter, 2-year-old son, newborn daughter,” DeSantis said radio interview. “And tell school age, would zero concern sending them.” go parties....because COVID Fox really turned lately. Wait winter, get much worse. needs brought control ASAP every country planet. America accounts quarter world’s new cases? yes, looking European countries doing, hence commenting post. ask question Montana Nevada. feds trying control flow data much trust data? Even fully trusting data Florida.  high blood pressure elderly parents It’s almost like Europe Asia hasn’t already tested shown worked... vaccine useless could vaccine hundreds millions doses already made approved less two months still people sub shit idea makes want cry happiness 😅 guess actually happens. many lives lost, many people struggling without jobs!! People starting realize actually like person married to.. 

Some people actually learning even like children (around 24-7)... 

Kind shitty global health crisis realize like people married/created... 

But, hey 🎵🎶that's life🎵🎶  context historical info percentage ICU beds available time prior years? Peak time flu season? Yea, reckon people immunity however reports medical institutions, remember correctly. said reported immunity recovery.
At least anti-virals made already. actually terrifies Biden win... many people America come accept horrors neoliberalism normal. Normal boring politics America wars oil. Normal boring politics America police violence. Normal boring politics America unprecedented wealth inequality. Normal boring politics America ignoring climate change. want go back found normal boring future country species carry business normal.

Edit: expect act civil go back normalcy. I'm done civil this. VT really cool. lot fun things like things outdoors. Great fishing, hiking, hunting. Local population (generally) nice. live NW VT grew around Burlington, taxes high, yes get pay here. don’t make TON money enough live happily say love visiting states, love coming home green mountains. See: Canada Many governments europe do. things possible.

Yes, people need work person. talking essential workers, could limit number kids back school. could smaller class sizes larger outside areas truly essential workers. (Medical, best buy employees).

But school shove 31 middle schools shoebox say, ""keep mask on"". truly going bestest beautiful winter ever. magically disappear. Every business many (though all) homes. Ugh bought few. work peoples faces. Thank That's next congress's problem

that's next president's problem

That's neighbors problem. Pretty much. know? BELIEEEEVE hard enough ignore chaos destruction. mean it’s better feudalism, world 50 100 years left capitalists kill off.

Companies duty shareholders extract profits anything else.

This great job killing planet. Full grown adults lack consideration simply wear mask (much less plan reasonable approaches school fall) we’re going count selflessness teenagers save us. Great. whacked conspiracy ive heard gaining traction somehow hospitals too. Hospitals get paid reward per patient label corona case. incentive, labeling every flu-like symptom patient corona positive.

What even bother consider flu cases tend see massive drop summer (hence ""flu season"") instead seeing exponential growth cases. Possibly Arizona Florida bad outbreaks. miserable places outside summer  yeah i'm super confused this, someone argue didn't? thing younger people context covid mortality rate low Whereas many countries, even developed ones, court system goverment. I'll take it. tested negative. Rambling means care know lot, I’m it. right Tulsa. lived 8 years, could never make heads tails city direction it’s moving in. battle seems stalemate long time. OKC politics seems bit straight forward, Norman politics, live, fucking crazy years now. Sad part people prob even see news depending choose consume thier news sources. another ""hoax"" something never heard concerning... We're quicker demonize valved masks masks all, even chin guards. safe, best luck. There’s doctor r/medicine published several short stories experience working covid ward NYC height pandemic. talks watching patients die alone, gasping air, watching slowly suffocate death. stories published.

Edit: it’s u/madfrogurt anyone wants read. Skilled writer.  ""*Can't expect man wear protection. That's woman's job.*"" Mike Gordon notoriously unfriendly. diddler Well, no. main reason Republicans want kill USPS privatize make money it. going least 20 years. forced USPS fully fund pensions 70 years - ""bankrupt"" them. 

The elderly big users voting mail, people likely vote republican, big players Republican party want control process, kill it. want like Texas: Texas allows people vote mail medical reason - include 65 years valid reason. hand threatening prosecute people try use pandemic reason voting mail, 'cause ""valid"" reason. 

On points completely agree. Republicans gerrymandering voter suppression, given green light Supreme Court.

This going ugliest scariest election ever, Democrats lose become standard operating procedure. time, WW2 I'd say, Eisenhower's warning military industrial complex ignored America run capitalism, yeah, like rest world problems, America could developed rational way like rest first world economies, cronyism we'll, are. Nah risk permanent costly life altering damage. first symptoms early February beginning sore throat, headache, cough, weirdest phlegm I've ever experienced. thick felt like bring choking it.

My O2 dropped lows 90s high 80s mid-March.

The symptoms came cyclical waves (improving every 2 3 weeks returning) included: 

* headaches
* fevers
* extreme fatigue
* shortness breath
* loss smell taste
* muscle aches
* ear pressure pain
* perpetual sticky phlegm
* post nasal drip (like waterfall)
* coughing 4-5 months (severity lessened time, worse first 3 months)

I still get fatigue, random shortness breath, constant phlegm, loss smell.

I think Covid something anyone trying get purpose ""build immunity"". Thank time. completely understand mean now. 

Sorry write dumb person like me.

The thing ""reflect wrote"" pointing direction thought mean explained. sure try learn. Thank kind stranger!  moment right trump guess made trump look bad supporters (or thats one trumps “advisers” convinced Incompetent and/or ideology driven government, exceptional public trust government authorities, culture consensus suffer social consequences deviate truth established leaders. makes sense, since shortages US. Doctors spreading rumors stay business? knew?

**Edit**: test /s system concluded. Please use /s times sarcastic. help? would need test every day result day make much difference.

And would still help others. fair, felt terminating pregnancy different throttling infant crib one political party pro-crib murder one it, matter rest platform is.

I'm trying weigh particular argument (read: please argue abortion, I'm really tired it). saying, understand would bit hot button issue. literally idea things work. Everything depend live requires others produce you. Remove people producing you, longer things. 

The fact don’t understand beyond shocking.  US can't lock now, deaths would vain. /s sub bizarre, small group users want covid doomsday scenario let states police powers citizens. people also hate trump thing. 

They think Guy upstanding citizen never abuse powers. course, they're also gambling humanity next 50 guys also upstanding citizens never abuse powers. short, people utter fools. government given little power possible, every bit sunset clause. ready surprise!

TOTAL RECALL always get downvoted pointing out, say large percentage recovered patients lose antibodies months recovering: anyone comes screaming vaccines supposed boost antibody counts way past convalescent serum levels, may mean might couple months more. real assessment durability vaccine well 2021. current vaccine studies, aim conclude months, answer that. Warp Speed bogus delusion sell public, we'd effective vaccine end year, vaccines cannot reasonably assessed effective least year followup observation. see relevant. Yes, thank mean Florida Disney two different places choice ( resign) shoes, would already done so. high school teacher wife educational diagnostician. fortunate children middle school childcare issue us. Additionally excellent health. feel parents children going see deficits person classes parents work. favor remote learning, feasible majority families district zone. worried pandemic severely damage public school system many areas. Reinfected. blow fast. in-laws still say hoax? conspiracy? changed tune?  Regardless people come from, gets pretty annoying seeing tourists parts world live. 

I live tiny rural area west Ireland, maybe 1200 people. walking last days seen convoy motorbikes foreign number plates. Two South Africans local petrol station. outrageous amount cars non-Irish number plates passing / filling cars. 

It fills grim feeling knowing matter well internally, governments super lax rules comes letting people make efforts pointless.

We consistently single digits new cases day recently we’re back nearly 30+ day. swear im restaurant right now. EVERYONE wearing mask except me🤬🤬🤬 Yea, visited Texas southern states two years ago, surprised amount flags. Way red flags saw China Russia. jealous states getting right absolutely infuriating - “United” ass... #CRTS SUCKED ASS!

#,,l,,(-_-),,l,, Massive outbreaks *BEFORE* sending kids back school lead CATASTROPHIC spread next month. Deathwise, I'm going guess start seeing massive deaths early mid November, election.

The US hide numbers much possible election. It’s parents getting sick kids. kids getting sick us. boys 7 11 years old, getting sick *each other*. fights kids happening daily, increasing frequency. They’re sick want play someone else. play kids, it’s goddamned hot outside spend day park. get couple hours morning (before 10am), couple hours evening (after 6pm). husband sick waiting COVID test results. we’re actually quarantined there’s park visits all.

It’s don’t love kids. definitely do. parents shouldn’t *only* interaction kids have. *That* life signed kids. parent *did* sign that, probably severe co-dependency issues needs reported CPS, *is* form abuse.

Fucking assholes don’t kids don’t understand reality situation really burn noodle. Congrats child-free. Obviously anyone kids must hate them. Fucking assholes. Atorvastatin doesn’t prevent getting liver damage. may lower risk this, take atorvastatin too, doctor tested every three months us signs liver problems. course stats children show risk; QUARANTINED FIRST.
How show facts parents lost children Covid. real comfort.
Just taking numbers post saw; rates predicted children, 180,000 kids catch it, 300 die.
I willing sacrifice 300 children price. you? 300 children choosing give flip about? likely started noticing infections? Exponential growth work way. Good. smarter. Similar Envo mask. Plus wear hours without getting pressure sores soft silicone seal. Hope MIT mask produced great quantities. Imagine two guys crowd, carrying shotguns.

One fires shotgun straight crowd. fires shotgun slightly downward angle toward nearby pile dirt.

The dirt pile akin homemade mask. prevent transmission, redirect lot less harm. completely protect crowd, soften blow fewer people likely get hurt.

The downside homemade masks encourage sloppy behavior people. clear people see homemade masks license whatever want. rest us would better would stay home. #~~Republicans~~ want dead.

Edited there's stupid bot here. I'm similar boat, err, apartment. smell neighbor's smoking habit, understand air hallways designed pulled apartments handled apartment's HVAC system, single person wears masks here. Oh, standalone home. do, problem people dying NHS neglecting illness. Ive got two elderly relatives paramedics come month ill, refused take hospital one stopped breathing vomiting passing blood. shouldve hospitalised month ago.

I’m Indy, probably regard mask mandate. girlfriend rando town Lafayette; course see step rights. Imagine schools open. going disaster. good job 👏 Vaccines also. Giving Remdesivir already vented patients like throwing away.

It's effective immediately initial infection. Yes can’t forget Tucker Laura. Also tremendously Best. Aye. pretty much one envy Sweden travel ban list longest time. Illinois already mandatory masks indoors. Food taken care of, delivering food kids summer using small business donations. paired spectrum free internet kids, gave computers. dont cook lot lf food, sandwiches stuff. took care without federal state funding. spread readily adults? behavioral standpoint biological  Let’s see throw firecrackers yell “HES GOT M80!”

It’s nice legal fireworks state. starting see one side finally start shift views universal healthcare. They're starting try retire now, due willful ignorance, they're realizing can't can't afford healthcare. 

Don't get started worker benefits right work bullshit. I've worked jobs chanted mantra ""be thankful job,"" others chanted mantra ""we're thankful you."" latter always better option. flag.

Which stupid. flag can't tell do, flag, can't give orders even wants.

Does mean follow anyone waves flag hard enough?

It make logical sense getting kids indoctrinated unnamed state secular religion American supremacy. painful read try decipher. Nothing says makes sense. makes wonder characteristics organized religion might shape way thinking, thus approach pandemic--sociologically psychologically speaking. need figure deal virus. Putting kids closed quarters impossible task keeping apart, hoping carry virus much, def plan.

I understand worry schooling spreading deadly disease.
School can't done safely virus. company produce (it's easy make) get license produce it. Licensing cost bottleneck here. Many Americans days saying cdc fake news so.... can't wait see Oxford's phase 1 paper. due tomorrow could use good news since situation country kinda going towards really fucking bad every negative news get really making scared. That's frustrating thing high school teacher. students much able stay home themselves, I'm tried ""but social development"" conversation. social development would stifled grief. Reopening plans fail consider closely knit school communities are. would rather kids going stir crazy wracked grief. I've students grieving close friend family member grief makes hard function. Grief unbearably hard adults, teens nearly level coping skills. 

Online education feels like prepares better college, there's teacher shoulder making participate. hybrid model high schools post-pandemic worst idea tbh. sides. States curriculum includes CNN10 students watch study CNN report it. push youth embrace left, villainize right. problem sides, doctoring left early age... eventually get bucked left tend go extreme right left working them. huge division America absolutely agree this. would love see Emily Monroe Nichols run. think problem, Tulsa truly tale two cities. south, primarily white, republican side town running Kevin Hern. north, primarily black latino, democratic side town running Kojo Asamoa-Caesar district 1. know unique history Tulsa compared unique history OKC, causes divide running statewide democrats. 


Especially context pick conservative democrats/moderate republicans. mention tribal issues facing Oklahoma whole, never Native American governor, also complicated republican massive majority state.



Sorry rambling. tough here. That’s necessarily parents fault. economy based 2 working parents feed children. work ecosystem made unforgivable miss work sick, let alone children sick. Combine two get current ecosystem economy relies less school education day care parents need work work fire sick child isn’t excuse.

What need tackle core problem schools reprioritize education. need strict laws force employers accommodate sick dependents protected time employees. employers that, don’t. version handling bankruptcy. Get money fast company implodes, except company country millions people.

Edit: oops millions, billions 85 babies one Texas county contract covid? I’m sorry! work hotel Massachusetts say completely different here. signs posted everywhere EVERYONE wears masks. time time somebody forgets coming lobby either turn around go back get sheepishly pull shirt collar cover nose mouth walk quickly by. Mask compliance high. definitely correlation relatively low case count high compliance! warp speed problem, literally giving money vaccine development removes risk, speeds development. People dont masks avoid like plague. Thanks dickhead dont cross street avoid now. late Bullets count.
Already invented. Yup! Lol. far places 30% positive now, much higher week. I’m sure effective testing four time done months ago. They’re wasting time.  Hopefully things states settle next winter, Vermont popular ski area. also comment Nashville video Twitter? didn't, someone else did. Considering number every multiple decade biological incidents second half 2019, chances guy wake one morning decide warn hypothetical disaster.

Someone wants end testing 4 million infections look good, going tell world there's new virus going around US anyone else knew. lot people still realize without workers us economy collapse, even food supply chain collapse Well deserves it. Love karma that, even COVID-19 wiped earth tomorrow people realize isn’t one-time thing right? pandemics, new viruses future whatever tools processes figure COVID-19 undoubtedly pay dividends future pandemics. course pointed out, COVID-19 far useful too. happens leopard eats face? leopard inception? Yeah word great think agree.

It would super cool got everything wanted without work.

It would super cool could wave fairy wand make COVID go away.

I want pay taxes means end strong federal government.

I want eat rich I'm fine tax slope gets progressive means pay little - means truly poor people saved poverty cycle, die medical debt old age, feel like government serving people abandoning them, rich paying even me, I'd still pay little more. Wish bargaining power make deal. think giving much credit. see young people ignoring precautions seem mostly dumb kids want party (and also plenty adults mindset). always people like that, doubt they're horrors world drove nihilism something. also get sense people really informed enough what's going around despair state world would what's driving them. Sorry bearer bad news, people shopping. much money thrown around last months makes sick. Brought back retail position three weeks ago dealt elderly disabled customers daily basis, addition middle aged young adults. brought back furlough, coworkers enjoyed best June ever. 

Oh masks must getting heavy everyone started wearing nose. much better adherence protocol fully opened Upstate NY. guess need reminded immune special too. Let’s forget, taking kids herd immunity covid parties sending school. Americans banned dude here. 10 month old. husband goes work (everyone wears masks thankfully isn’t super close anyone right no) leave take walk (when it’s 100* rare) husband goes grocery pickup. get diapers formula delivered. Even precautions fear son. people STILL fight this? People surely can’t ignorant/stubborn, they? truly don’t get Thank introducing phrase "" yuck someone else's yum"" adding vocabulary! That’s governor Abbott saying everyone sub disagreed Bravo, Vermont!!! bad take. “I don’t think Americans want bunker place next 24 months.” 
Yeah, know. took less three months huge portion Americans say screw it, need served meal get haircut!!! answer ""Took"" Damnit. I'm Oklahoma. assumptions make ass you. part understand? 600 dollars leaves quite bit room minimum wage realistic average wage worker. I'm sorry get that. can't make shit TIL administration wared covid back september. time stop blaming masks social distancing etc etc look real problem lays. spare bullshit fauci. Youve manipulative little scumbag since HIV/aids epidemic indeed shocker took long get tested positive douche. Shocked what? governor's high school biology teacher tell 2 types human genes? Chicken pox scary shit adult.  started surgical mask April got lot crap it. lot people probably wanted so. government stepped up. keeps avoiding elephant room: boss. That's one propagating pandemic. need federal mask mandate. “fake physical fitness” mean? smirk, too. Every time answers question ""Well, I'm lawyer"" ""It's law"" wanna puke I’d give gold could. Literally made LMAO needed it. Bad! DeSantis: Earth, Hitler, 1938. I'm lucky I'm ugly too! South Korea good examples follow adults around them. US you’ll parents telling kid “if gets uncomfortable take off” Vermont's largest city like 42,000 people. That's barely city. literally smallest city biggest state. states least 100k population city. others Wyoming, West Virginia, Maine Delaware. Two hairstylists coronavirus saw 140 clients. new infections linked salon, officials Happy cake day. stay safe mask make next one Population density /=/ rural. 

India Bangladesh insanely dense, yet also rural. Vermont's population mostly low density rural counties small towns, almost real cities. 18% Vermont lives cities, none cities 50,000 people.

You areas russia vast majority population lives dense cities, actual region huge tons wilderness statistical population density tiny. Honestly, I’m tired people treating cough like I’m COVID-19 positive, tested negative, I’m like infected trash that’s ruining economy clogging hospitals. I’m guy cough, wear mask, I’m human like everyone else, I’m Infected, don’t treat like I’m leper sort pandemic.

/s  Yes sending covid positive patients back nursing homes infect others kill hundreds unnecessary top notch   think better job Illinois. pretty mild mannered own, 

Except FDA issues warning take hydroxychloroquine due dangerous side idea Covid would gone Easter mostly general media March
  
HA HA HA!
You must advanced degree gaslighting. re-writing history lived months ago.  

Trump failed miserably leading United States very, rough time. inaction misdirection killed Americans year. things undisputable facts. That’s wear Michael Myers mask times. virus forcing hard decisions across world. lead quite lot deaths, however nationwide shutdown worth many countries. also affect certain age group people obesity diabetes hard, yet people it’s less risky seasonal flu. that’s schools definitely reopening optionally. It’s hard conceive less risky stay home prolonged period time. Even shutdown implemented, US can’t much force people stay home either, virus still spreads anyway. 

The current method looks bad surface, it’s actually best way US handle this. It’s public choose wanna focus energy stop ignore it. government give advice. /r/iamatotalpieceofshit Yes shovel patients nursing homes. That’s great way. It""s ballpark thought would be. shame, probably safest persons world, can't return home. executive branch control funding.

FFS Congress get spine. enough teachers refused return wouldn’t find another option? controversial seem understand rural is. us rural defined anywhere inside urban area. urban area Vermont burlington. Maybe. Small pox eradicated? eBay scalping one. Let's vote charlatans November. would want end? 

Darwinism finest full display. 

And level entertainment trump office staggering.

I want ride. need keep life interesting. safe 

Safe = boring *ralph.jpg* “I’m helping” Albany here, went pick food today there’s many people taking seriously. Group people making reservations group friends go tonight, masks. 15 confirmed cases Hudson alone 4th July party. It’s going get worse.  Sounds like learning something conservatives. love freedoms. hate mind government kills you. need go outside. Yep, too! Alliance!!! Agreed. Plus reality parents kids even social distancing, agreeing testing, anti-mask, dismissing whole thing. simply don’t know around aren’t there. ran building fire, wearing favorite gasoline-soaked shirt. idea went flames! worry, I’m sure number cases slow US coming weeks Trump requiring Covid case numbers go CDC / Lol, wife really flexible schedule stay home really time there's less need push it. think we've ever medicated kids sent school honest. New York shit hole lol Asians better math understands exponential growth better? Nothing new here. December 31st... 

167 days January 1, 2021.

4,008 hours 1/1/21.

240,480 minutes 01/01/2021.

14,428,800 seconds 1st January 2021. Fauci, one else, even clue this... there’s evidence suggesting anything country state done helped whatsoever... lock-ins, masks, etc. kidding really bizarre would say that. friends NYC one would agree. Agreed. Trump Administration idiot governors sides aisle share much responsibility, sure, Americans also responsible spread COVID-19. major reason we're current situation mental gymnastics selfishness public.  excess deaths down!!!! using source meeee!!! NYC pretty solid job getting field hospitals set quickly reopening process fair considering went through, doesn’t neglect fact initial response atrocious, sub doesn’t seem get it. Every form government failed us. Trump fucked up, Cuomo fucked up, sides fucked up, polarized nation realize might hold “leaders” accountable. sub particular picks certain data order back political preference, furthering dividing otherwise pretty straightforward issue. it’s ironic, since virus care believe lots people sub acts like does. call something bad, awful, horrible, pretty reasonable someone ask better. states looking better right now? many.

And look single number without even considering context number, either dumb (which think are) disingenuous. 

The topic managed reopening, matter many people try drag topic response first couple weeks. actually topic, states handled reopening better? state better now?

If response change subject again, well... yeah. Classic r/leopardsatemyface image fruit vendor article? know started guy. totally agree, sound brainwashed. know majority acting way, lot incidents store employees guns pulled trying enforce mask policies. people completely unhinged. think we'd rather wear masks, obviously right thing now. cause divide overt displays anger ridiculous. simple thing really help lot, keep places open relatively safely - think they'd it, since oppose kind lockdowns. get it, depressing know even distancing we've done, things much worse back March. wish people would unite fight thing. better leadership, maybe would done. I'll apologize home state. I'm sorry Republican representatives DENSE.  nice. situations same. Two hairdressers wore simple face masks two weeks infection pass looks like i’m moving vermont state isn’t taking seriously actually Satanism about. Go educate yourself. LA here, people really aren’t distancing much should. I’ve gone beach couple times &amp; park get fresh air &amp; always surprised amount people see even surprised ones wearing masks. honestly don’t even feel safe walk neighborhood sometimes many people out. I’ve also driven restaurants packed outdoor areas &amp; invited several different gatherings. People careless. Evidence doesnt mean shit people actually need this. Maya Rudolph 2020!  Thanks. think key observation: endless line cars, reaching out-of-sight

It good photographic eye see call attention it. bums too.

Thanks. actively avoids trying learn anything. 

Right next word ""Republican"" dictionary.  else say??? Lol.

 Cuomo literally killed grandma. completely unnecessary loss life. countries figured out. heard experts discussing 
 guy saying it. 
 Griffin... He’s seen couple cases. 
 
Lmao amazing. done.  Trump Bolsonaro set trend 2 countries. Thomas Jefferson said carry around Pizza Raft!!!! Can’t believe there’s human beings think masks don’t help ☠️ That's mean treat parents badly actions government. reading made cry feel fucking helpless. dad tries talk planning 401k, retirement, blah blah. i'm like ?????????? climate change end us definitely authoritarian gov't place get Canadian entertainers. us middle school. Take money! love ""The Dirty Jerz"" ? Well guess main reason would doesn’t actually exist? anything less useful that? ""Nearly everyone"" big stretch varies lot even neighborhood neighborhood.

E.g. today walked street 1 block car parked get something it. decided count people saw wearing masks.

It short walk, saw 15 people also about. 15, 3 wearing masks. Hillcrest, socially progressive epicenter SD.

And seen videos PB, lesser extent Gaslamp.

It's visitors. help, them. god hate country right now. really unfortunate opening schools large risk teachers especially old ones Pretty common sociopaths. Reflection regrets aren’t really thing. losing control. That’s US started. That’s also Chile lost control. government introduced GoTo tourism campaign Obon coming August. good all...  killing people. Put historical anecdotes aside. science. possible engineered better virus meant thin population ""the weak?"" Looks like fruit seller getting blown guy background. useful image represent covid One person every 11 seconds dying corona virus. Relax, tough guy. easy reduce numbers big time susceptible population already passed away, ""reopening"" referenced even truly happened yet. Phase 4 even include indoor dining restaurants. reopening handled well nothing actually reopened? I’m that, better right lol Shhhhhh you’re supposed bring up....

We can’t expect perfection event like this, way Cuomo handled nursing home situation seems unacceptable (and well discussed main stream media). Maybe I’m missing something sounds like (or someone else) knowingly sent senior citizens diagnosed positive back nursing homes spreads like wildfire. went school chicken pox. mom thought rash. long Google Web MD. idea pox wanted make sure didn’t mess perfect attendance. 🤦🏻‍♀️ soon got bus, identified isolated. school pissed gave mom earful. Washington near densely populated. um folks like yourseld would let virus burn country kill 300 million......

enjoy wearing mask guess? Yes obvious fact. North South Central America. 

Next time I'll specific. Antibody tests come negative body responded fast-acting T-cell However, also case SARS-CoV-2 infection, measures cell B cell recognition become uncoupled, either mild infection triggered cell immunity without detectable antibody, antibody response transient already waned time cell memory still robust. hell state that? Wrong. would maybe bought time invented prior pandemic wasn’t. Thus rendering useless. vaccine readily available along mitigating medicines long manufactured useful quantities. Amen brother. Human phase III trial day 1. ""volunteers"". great job many things killed lot old people. possible true. Please tell I’m wrong wasn’t Fauci part original group saying Americans didn’t need wear face masks? us..check 607

Edit. means city..nyc...lot crackers around 607...they hate it...masks, non white..I go need painted. border Netherlands almost nobody wearing mask, inside out. Public transport exception, compulsory. Usually go food shopping get strange looks person mask on. secondary effect I've noticed wearing mask here, people assume must sick keep distance. r/nottheonion?

Maybe rest states, intentionally send nursing home patients test positive back nursing homes. mean, Desantis doesn’t, great! Yeap prices skyrocket well, sometimes even salary, heard lot people saying mown grass, pick oranges... 😔 guys made day😂😂 Deliberately letting people die election.

Crimes humanity. fucks need go jail.  British Columbia Canada skips Saturday Sunday every week smell bad too, different way. mf going hell C'mon, Burlington counts that. Groundhog day r/leopardsatemyface Qanons stupid trying divulge bs media propoganda clearly using available information substantiate deciet news outlets, response? wonder come site censors folks spitting truth, revel karma predisposed BS spewed. Well, young people heard beginning kills us old farts. Also people pre-existing conditions health issues.

They young healthy. also heard effect children, except studies coming effect children, getting infected, worse news making be.

So, course, young people going around like nothing matter. mean, right US still trying open schools Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama... hotspots ""THE KIDS GOING ALRIGHT!""

This hilarious would laugh crying stupid people are. actually *is* middle ground fear shiftless denial, despite DeSantis would like believe. Rural Oregon consistently voted taking responsibility ever since feds cut timber subsidies. Fucking Josephine County cut Sheriff lack finding shocked see people selling meth street fucking Christmas fair Grants Pass. taxes bad goddamned stupid shit. Finally somebody using fucking brain state! Vermonter here, least 2 people do! comparatively speaking, deaths barely cases south west US March/April? like virus spread North East, making way South west....if case, maybe kind herd immunity acquired North already - infection/recovery people masking keeping distance?

Interesting.... model thinking known ""cognitive dissonance."" Comfort came weeks later dude. elderly got hit quick. went based cdc nursing homes said could handle 

Let's pretend nursing homes bastion experienced medical care. Half barely functioning terrible staff We’re greatest incarceration rates That's territory. Would desk time desk! Maybe he's Maine hes speculating lol chill, Twitter Huh? too... Wtf Religion taken extreme leads US middle east. even go there? There's nothing can't justified faith accepted means truth. case India. 10% infected people related health care. 1% fatalities younger people, might even case health care wearing protective gear. fact divisive political issue health crisis exhausts me. lol'd that. Good one Yeah, Italy locked March 9, NYC March 20.

We're almost 4 months past that, states excuse. China. covid numbers also suspect. understand completely might feel guilty, whatever worth, almost certainly right thing. even daughter happens resent decision now, one day she'll mature enough look back realize that, information *at time*, best everyone involved. know tons parents making exact decision you. number grow get closer start academic year.  cases went down.. masks must helping sure you’ve Vermont? Pretty good nutshell mate, may add something good burger loving friends:

New South Wales, Sydney state capital, also seeing resurgence cases. It’s traced Victorian traveller visited pub Sydney virus spread there. 

It’s important know New South Wales hasn’t closed border Victoria. states/territories banning Victorians outright making pay hotel quarantine, NSW’s border Victoria remained open permit system, two states really close. Vic-NSW border didn’t shut first lockdown, permit system border means shit going down. now, every state territory reported surge cases like Vic NSW. Hell yeah bro, top 🖐 Well mask mainly protects others contamination. Still, see irony. even learn though. says regret wearing mask. even *less* fool Listen guy 👆 country""

Canada Mexico America....

America limited United States dont specify age like dont specify anything else ""new"" virus, keep masses uneasy uncertain. fuck dont know ""new"" virus created fucking laboratory. Doubtful. I'm 21 catching relatively early, whatever is. Ehhhh there’s another 3-4k pneumonia deaths Florida increase.

The virus nursing homes (again?). We’ll see report csmith2019, hope younger generation teachers older generation teachers come mutual respectful mindset. village prospers everyone onboard opinion citation. far losing done nothing refute article linked. can't believe 5 people upvoted saying French Revolution led Napoleon. Holy shit. policy leading height pandemic could used improvement...

if read Fauci’s actual comments (not silly headline), you’ll see he’s praising NY reopening strategy (I.e actually waiting cases come start reopening, preventing indoor dining/bars even stage 4) live Long Island, New York. far know, things pretty quiet here. Everyone see wears mask, rarely see people masks noses, stores following rules. 

Some even going farther needed, large plastic partitions countertops tables, others taking temperature go in.

What really bugs schools supposed reopening. Even cleanest state, don’t want go back there’s still chance get sick. 

I literally idea president’s game plan is. I’ve seen he’s got complete disregard lives citizens every word mouth lie, trying convince we’re model country he’s best world leader ever was. pretty gnarly false dichotomy going guy:

* can’t give mask mandate
* people don’t want shelter place two years

...bro, mask mandate make safe come out. find ethical problem minimal long subjects informed volunteers,.and possibly compensated risk. get slippery slope argument consequences pandemic potentially catastrophic. important note study covers time South Korea schools closed people voluntarily staying home except essential outings. household transmission going main thing. study infectious people various age groups might compared other. Upon reflection, think _Sunshine State_ meant ironically. r/trees fucking shitting me? According census bureau Texas doomed, sorry dude vermont naturally socially distanced  Small resort town Wisconsin here. Fuckheads Chicago since Memorial Day. Makes hate people normally closed. sacrificing opening schools unimportant shit like this. History unkind people companies making pandemic last much longer needs to. Oh that's low blow. welcome wagon toque maple leaf pin hereby rescinded. Thank keep Corona, we'll send chile Perhaps money problem . . .

. Zero plan... he's revealed. 


Because telling people want steal election generally jive well Umm ... think meant ""wearing"", right?

Is downvoted? meant wearing ... think 100% right. awful analogy. biased towards thinking everything think perfect. Sorry, aint true. 

Eating skittles nothing help world, helping teachers teachers. could list number reasons analogy moronic, feeling conversation wont going further, reason continue this. mention hundreds articles historians, epidemiologists, journalists, biologists, hundred fields work experience epidemics pandemics warning everyone widely available vaccine likely still year everything goes perfectly. opinion hundreds people expertise pandemics get magically erased one University says track.

I'm vaccine, obviously, really, **really,** hope work they're promising. one article, contradicts months messages we've receiving tempering expectations speedy vaccine. Even article self cautioning people optimistic vaccine.

Hope best, prepare worst suppose. I'm hoping vaccine plays they're predicting going to, I'm expecting/preparing something delayed go wrong. Yes, absolutely think president would different pandemic. I'm thrilled guys developing vaccine quickly. couple cautions.

First, phase three trial subjects aged 18 55. They're testing teenagers 55. clear that's group would vaccinate.

Second, guys really taken torch try prime production side things contract produce 2 billion doses vaccine. 7 billion people planet, better nothing. Yet begs question, countries get vaccines? strained relations US brought last three half years prevent us even getting US timely fashion? apportion first two billion doses commensurate country's population?

Third, appalling lack centralized leadership US Federal government going come back bear exactly question gets vaccinated first. vaccine approved people 55, since older people seem suffer complications death, going first ones get vaccine US? Healthcare workers? get general citizens essential job? decides what's essential what's not, distribution going occur dependent solely many doses US receives?

Again, great news. news begs lot tactical questions US currently addressed. Fear motivates people move path vehicle. It’s people rarely walk blindfolded across highway wrestle beehives.

What idiot talking about?  Think poor oil corporations. already subsidize taxes, execs may able afford second yacht demand drops much. hope Canada get left vaccine decided partner China vaccine development. absolutely trust anything China government anything with. Many nhs workers involved phase 2/3 trials due working closely patients higher probability challenge virus. 

Most nations protocols new vaccine rollouts put healthcare workers front line exposure. Add fact Oxford English university would imagine nhs workers first world provided vaccine effective. mean much people going lives normal government neglects implement shutdowns. People still going work, see family friends, entertainment. That's takes. Especially since pushback Texas right people safe accord, sadly enough. nothing consistent! 1. [Moderna executives hiked stock sales announcing positive vaccine [How Moderna executives cashing COVID-19 vaccine stock [Moderna executives cashed $89M shares year, stock price soared vaccine Well, whole ""emulate Trump"" thing. Trump says hydroxychloroquine miracle drug, must study says different politically biased.

Masks: Trump wear one says one make us so, going wear masks! obviously knows much rest us. *That last bit perplexing considering myriad times he's flat wrong virus.* everyone drabbled writeups ""knows stuff"" makes 100% assured happening. 

Never read ""100% assured happening"", rather discussed reasonable manner. [Like True effort try save re-election, goodness heart. According RIVM (Dutch CDC), 12% people corona related symptoms get test. 

A lot people good intentions: 68% say would get tested would symptoms, people actually symptoms, 28% say they'd get tested. Unfortunately 12% actually come test.

The goes staying home. people symptoms yet, 87% says they'd stay home. drops 60% actually develop symptoms, Unfortunately reality seems worse. 8 10 people symptoms stay home. 4 10 go work, 3 10 go restaurants 8 10 his/her groceries showing corona symptoms. 

95% people say they'd ready go isolation get tested positive 84% would ready go isolation housemate gets tested positive.

His high school already online system. expanded Google school app. 

BTW, rarely see anyone mention fact students also change classes throughout day. Same. vaccine 100% effective? Recent FDA conveys FDA would expect COVID-19 vaccine would prevent disease decrease severity least 50% people vaccinated.

That's low bar IMO. Worst case vaccine reduces severity, 50% people get vaccine. sure hope vaccines come good enough make people ""effectively immune"" guarantee point.  not, confirm 😂 rant. Sorry.

Family friends (mother daughter) visited parents-in-law. Family friends driven Florida Kentucky, stopping various places/friends/family along way. Family friends stopped inlaws' house, daughter stayed car. *""Oh corona""* says mother, wearing mask keeping distance, washing hands. Inlaws (in late 70s) ""don't remember"" wearing masks, washed anything. (in words, didn't, want children shouting even more)

This mother visited brother law Kentucky too, mention daughter sick. Brother law family freaking out, least masked visit, visitors weren't, visited Thursday.

This coming via different sources right now, that's gist it. traveling mother daughter decided OK mother interact lots people without mask ""she sick"". spending days car someone COVID-19 *totally* safe, right?!?

My wife emotionally wrecked right now. We're Michigan thus distant bullshit, entire immediate family exposed coronavirus. happened Thursday, wife's parents taking things seriously ""it's days we're sick"".

Please, people, treat seriously wear mask. Wash hands thoroughly. travel sick person.

I know think more.  say them. vast groups republicans voting biden november. Anyone supports trump incarcerated hes booted. arrested instant loses vote. wearing mask public endanger around yourself. purpose mask contain cough. mask contains mine. Lol 2020, finance vacation sudden outbreak, many babies two years old tested positive since started getting cases March. Also, baby born positive since mother got virus I’m assuming you’re pro quarantine masks probably protests? offence coexist someone disagrees questions? confirm, 30 days 90 waiting period mine over. Lets totally honest though? anyone expect roll vaccine go smoothly US? used grift corruption people probably getting next spring. Easier said done. suggest change minds without verbal/ physical altercation? would stop donating mask someone use it?  time *fun math*.

Let's reasonable go every eight hours. done 13.2 years, give sleeping, eating going bathroom. work employer may appreciate endless fiddling abacus adding machine workplace. Given 40 hour work week means that, unless convince employer important time expands 17.3 years. Oops, we're generation times means starting progeny already counted. 

All this, course, quite unrealistic. eat, sleep go bathroom, speak complain neighbors internet. 'Sadie Shades' spends hours snooping neighborhood curtains spends even fraction percent time important task. wish continue hobby/essential work anywhere near normal way life I'd suggest rewriting effort ongoing task great, great, great, great grandchildren.  get N100 filters instead P100.

I call “elected officials”. UK nuisance level? get information? saying know vaccine chance long term side effects Covid 19 certainly does: heart, lung, liver damage, neurological problems, list goes on. getting vaccine guarantee safety threat catching coronavirus real.

So way test got EBV too? highly suspect it. I've chronically fatigued badly ever since. awesome true. fastest species ever figured 5 years. 0 chance proves useful us quickly. Wtf greeter? still know numbers are. Known R, known rising number cases, open 3 weeks, religious services unlimited number attendees now. many deaths average per day NYC bad here. might misunderstood/misrepresented right nobody understands well yet real Everything bigger Texas can’t wait cure ready way yo expensive anyone afford don’t think anyone’s excluding you. don’t really understand difference clerk, official, director operations chief staff city hall, people get thing need, like people. don’t even know nomenclature different layers management various domains Wal Mart local newspaper, say, “Hey, help please.” What's name incredibly stupid decision executed safest way feasable? Cuz that's is. see leadership anywhere right NYC New England states? true? I’ve advocating bigger chain stores private security handle shit. living wage person deal moronic assholes... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm inclined get idiots young vaccinated first, also front line workers businesses must stay open. Healthcare nice too, lotta Karens would scream bloody murder scrubs didn't. Idiots first though. numbers (Australia) pretty much identical yours. government threw us back lockdown jail MINIMUM 6 weeks?!  metric watch people testing positive.

Thanks groundbreaking insight CBC can’t wait see else discovered along way. It’ll like cool stuff developed NASA research! crazy headline! SF Chronicle really goes hard guess believe term cloaca fellow human Yup. instead, many school thanksgiving break... makes sense never know Note:

If family doctor consistently gave contradictory advice every visit long would use him?

**Perspective**: Fauci Federal Civil Servant worked long job accountability. reason fear mistakes enjoys celebrity status.

Fauci incompetent doctor injures kills patients. found management moves different hospital injure kill unsuspecting patients.

My take first briefings: Fauci educated ignoramus. talking US. Almost Europe Asia needed done, followed best available science, acted decidedly, see far, far lower fatalities countries didn't.  vaccine comes out, countries acted decidedly followed best available science follow pattern, vaccinate themselves, quickly stablish herd immunity. US follow pattern enough people vaccinate. Herd immunity stablished US time, people continue die. scientist tell science fact. It’s evidence-based theory. wearing mask stupid mounting evidence shows wearing mask reduces transmission virus. Everybody wear mask public. 

Here ya go, educate yourself: scientific method, clear distinction facts, observed and/or measured, theories, scientists' explanations interpretations facts. 

And blog post actual scientist explaining I’m saying well: probably yearly shot. vaccine targets spike protein part every ""strain"" virus. successful work every known mutation uses spike protein latch onto ace cells. Right? sitting tears welling hoping family get Christmas time finally everyone together without worrying. I'll even take China's old school in-activated vaccine Moderna Canadian UHC expensive certainly perfect (significant gaps coverage dental, mental health prescription drugs, wait times specialists). folks - regardless political affiliation - mind paying extra taxes ensure free/low cost all. Corrected headline

Study: ""Humans humans spread coronavirus effectively humans."" Yeah that. 

It's small physically population wise. density similar rural areas states like Alabama Georgia.

It little larger cities, given border Montreal closed, get state traffic Boston NYC rural Alabama gets large cities. Also helps large cities handled outbreak better controlled things spill out. 

Differences aggressive shut early, mandatory quarantine state travelers (which lot staters following unfortunately), lots mask wearing.

There's also aggressive contact tracing, quick testing turn around, readily available testing. Hell allow asymptomatic testing too. could call doctor right get tested result back tomorrow since qualify expedited testing. it'd 2 3 days. 

Hell lot states get faster covid test driving Vermont, undergoing mandatory 7 day quarantine, getting covid testing (part 7 day quarantine protocol), getting result back. 

Bars restaurants mainly outdoor seating still. Even couple local breweries voluntarily closed staff exposed covid case home (not work).

The response lot like Europe Brazil. See: GOP's privatization plans USPS. Americans wear masks, anyone think get jab? Absolutely. it’s near impossible keep kids away either  article seem indicate NBA/MLS samples tested Florida labs, doesn’t directly say numbers counted toward Florida’s totals. methodology obscured state sense whether would count toward Florida’s totals manipulations everywhere. would seem interest so. Saying zero people thinking argument head count.

Oh, completely forget anything CFR, IFR, symptoms, etc.

He's wrong simply one thing: testing facilitates contact tracing gives states counties ability see resources needed, divert properly. gives data needed ambulances wait 3, 4 5+ hours queue patient capacity.

Because, despite many people asymptomatic, mild enough case warrant hospitalization - large enough percentage need hospitalized, left unchecked systems collapse people die needlessly. I'll take tree fiddy. don’t live Boston NYC understand massive protests, spike cases deaths. cause spikes, protests, states opened early May. Stop blaming protesters. millions people ate inside restaurants partied inside bars. Plus people go gym get haircuts. don’t know anyone would want sit indoors restraint meal middle pandemic. Gross. don’t cry, day see headline day cry happy tears. Can't contact trace protest 200 people wearing masks.

You know marching with.  would politically advantageous came election. anything, likely he'll unsafely rush imho How's possible soon? would loved read got hit ""subscribe"" wall Understood, perhaps took point personally, simply encounter much sentiment r/coronavirus matches described; contrary, see people opposed masks stay-home orders claiming want us remain home permanently without citation. Maybe case niche communities like ones noted see mainstream channels communication. SARS vaccine development least decade. Talk goes back 2003-2005 Nope. Watch won’t available Biden wins. doesn’t won’t see till next year spring. Guarans. Watch Thank pasting article. novel flu vaccine development nothing getting COVID vaccine safely designed tested time. two completely different things. they're using similar base developmental flu vaccine ensure COVID-19 vaccine safer free side-effects manufacturer's vaccine. Vaccines plug-and-play.

You said they've ""had vaccine development years."" website specifically said ""started work vaccine January 2020."" Yes, may basing previously developed influenza vaccine. vaccine developed COVID-19. saying ""it's fine, they've tested they've developed years"" demonstrably wrong, Oxford would tell that.

It's shocking calling ignorant this. sounds like fairly ignorant vaccines. probably continue spread misinformation. someone explain magically create vaccine something catch multiple times, even building antibodies to? get vaccinated less likely get it. bad news. type news stories come almost every week ... point become typical cry wolf messages ignore refuse baited clicking Bro stupid us world, described special types doctors nurses, way forgotten, long shot, maybe badly catagorised? !remindme 3 weeks would go get I'm allowed go  FMLA leave unpaid.

What we're talking --- civilized countries --- paid sick leave.

It's nice US made somewhat less legal fire people sick, developed countries also protections make sure people still pay bills get sick. people regurgitate this. get dude, read one article expert lol. scientists Oxford clearly wrong idea they're doing. Yep. job, house, prospects, end sight needless crisis. I'm sorry 😞 compromised immune system likely got infected even vaccinated, vaccines teach immune system do, system working right going job correctly. like [11, 16, 17 year died Florida alone coronavirus anything. It’s like 16% cases people 15 24 years old, either. [Totally hasn’t killed infants, It’s blatant untruth say young people cannot die it, millions return school, it’s safe say number young deaths would rise drastically.

Stop trying twist facts real data. Tons kids don’t wash hands using bathroom even pandemic, would start now? It’s also gonna disaster schools right-leaning areas parents likely parrot anti-mask sentiment kids.  reputable website? coronavirus outbreak wearing plastic visors infected, Swiss government said plastic shields inadequate protection worn combination face mask. Holy fuck actual fucking good news thread? Even come one I’m still thinking wearing mask places avoiding people shit apt happen don’t want harm anyone else I’ve read enough people’s life’s end dying people’s selfishness. Last thing want end someone’s happiness. retarded?  Yeah, mom teacher maybe understand. Cause I'm sure said want risk life saying ma, teacher, gotta teach. Dying risk take educate young. Good day. say front line workers? People seem forget firefighters police close public everyday well key workers essential keep country running :) It’s change positivity rate recommend watching, number positive cases. Good reading skills, there. fucking duh Read comments story get feeling lot people really tweaked thought covid19 pills going stock store soon. genuinely hope delusion widespread.  So, measles child.  gather makes immune.  Would test detect antibodies now, many decades later?  Somehow seems unlikely me. mumps.  

Any actual scientists care weigh in? Mr. October you. Yes right. wrong.  COVID-19 shows differently children adults.

Yeah, negative test negative test. Wording like (""Claremont 13-Year-Old Dies Experiencing COVID-19 Symptoms"") *negative* test atrocious. say ""Claremont 13-Year-Old Dies Experiencing cancer Symptoms"" cancer. like ride (except maybe big starwars one, reservation system bit different) wait longer hour thirty minutes. Good point. Also readers, Sinai report nearly 20,000 people tested positive COVID. three months later, 90% still antibodies. Mexican lives Mexico honestly tell it’s much better. Thank you, couldn’t get past paywall either. Well I'm uk, live many corona cases worship stool guess really mind. Yeah deserts Nevada 100 people living there. safer Vermont? Probably. amount metric compared Vegas/Reno metros could say Nevada rural Vermont, whole, keeps Nevadans safer? all.

Vermont whole pretty evenly rural, experience risk across state pretty similar. that's representative state whole.

I think we're saying thing like using overall state metrics like population density average represent actual demographics states. think misunderstanding vaccine made. Yes, process making vaccine similar virus. case.... new virus. can't simply plug equation work. true, would vaccine ebola, SARS (which failed), viruses well. Keep up, might one left alive. become governor declare King Texas.  Weird, that's different claim studies. 

Let ask , believe children spread it, get infected? Well... chose great time visit family here. Thankfully planned activities kayaking cycling. economy US also disaster tbf Charlie? ""It is"" - Actual Trump quote today regards 140k dead. thing happen MI. vaccine actually development several years SarsCov2 emerged tested safety. modified combat specific pathogen safety profile well known played role speed able advance trials.

If started development February/March anywhere near stage. “on brink”, jumped way loooong time ago think summer weather somehow lessens symptoms people get tested much low numbers, although new cases popping country usually can't traced known case.

Testing actually almost doubled last week June rate new cases kept (slowly) decreasing. 

I definitely share worry second wave coming, time look back well spring first wave, think much better prepared fight second wave. mind hard pessimistic chances. likely stress. struggle believe - back school regulations. want sort metric; cases x amount daily, positive tests y, etc crosses threshold lock go remote school. 

The way (worse many places March/ April), people say bad without anything really it. Hope ready! cold freezing room keep meat, always wet, know virus survive longer cold humid atmosphere. Wow go businesses, youre ""irresponsible."" people work, get groceries, etc. Yeah, I’m high school like, 10 subs teach high school level. already dwindling time school got shut down. one kid gets sick that’s shit ton students potentially exposed average class size is, say, 25 6-7 classes day teachers too. It’s gonna come tumbling real quick. Again, index studies show us anythign parents ones leaving house without children way around.  commenter D. Trump? interesting. classes blocked differently? undiagnosed adhd high school times retake class summer school excelled. classes academically challenging weren’t ones failed, wasn’t foundation succeed second time. concentrated timeline singular focus. hated school actually liked summer school. uneven inflation. cases, even deflation.

Here amateur economic reasoning (my PhD studies math, econ, listen/read lot professional economists). 

1. money supply going ordinary Americans, going big corporations (in form 0% interest rate loans). people actually money (which demand remains constant means inflation). 

2. places inflation assets. Stocks particular, stock buybacks. Real estate probably go value near future since hedge funds like Black Rock start gobbling properties turning rental units (which 2008). supply housing market dropping, makes sense houses increase value. mention seen ""safe asset"" people money.

3. actuality situation deflation. big 4 US banks released Q2 earnings recently say thing, savings going way up. households know lose jobs near future not, careful money. corporations, aside buybacks, building war chest. Apple $250b shore accounts clue them. Certainly creating jobs since demand products everyone saving much.

4. Higher savings means deflation. Think inflation/deflation relative value money vs goods/services. inflation, means people demand goods/services money. deflation, means people demand money goods/services. high savings, means money relatively valuable, means deflation.

5. Deflation actually worst case scenario current economic situation, much debt aggregate American economy (government debt, household debt, corporate debt). Think it, money relatively valuable, debt relatively valuable, harder pay interests, lot debt defaults soon.

6. scenario known [debt actually mainstream explanation long depression 1929-1945. can't blame young people incompetent public policy leadership let covid-19 get North America first place. They're still trying individualize disaster I'm lying things I've said research know people listen say can't serious research they're like right know that's listeners F US alone order 300 million doses. No, happens flu virus mutates means new versions virus come up, vaccine longer covers flu viruses. field hospitals hospital ships god knows else disposal force disease back homes. I'm ""fucking healthcare worker"" like you, I'm moron Gurwin Jewish, 460-bed home Long Island, seemed well-prepared coronavirus early March, movable walls seal hallways infected. state order, trickle recovering COVID-19 patients local hospitals turned flood 58 people. walls put up, residents nonetheless began falling sick dying. end, 47 Gurwin residents died confirmed suspected COVID-19. Certainly easy Disney requires loops mask. bandana wouldn’t meet requirements. care give shit anyone else? protection level everyone else matter? self centered unaware world around aspects life, comes infecting people infectious diseases?

The protection much everyone else you.

Not understanding fucked. Ignorant folks care spreading deadly disease.

It absolutely relevant again, conversation about. infections battle immune response invading pathogen technically correct. Even don’t keep antibodies forever immune system able respond effectively quickly upon reinfection. Donald Cunt let US NO, lockdown, keep florida open is. need people fleeing lockdown travelling, like cockroaches looking safe haven, infecting people elsewhere. Border patrol, wealth creators, friends Ivanka move toe head line. effect shutting schools kids low income families (not mention low income countries) absolutely disastrous downplayed. effects shutting schools looks like almost full academic year (March-June, September-December) felt economic systems globally decades come. many kids whose parents lost jobs due covid live developing countries basic literacy sole breadwinners probably never return school.

Edit:spelling anyone already think true gonna 8 billion doses? I'm clearly talking New York patients. Amlo perfect, comparing Trump Bolsonaro cruel Seriously, incredibly lucky them. Great hear so, bunch reinfections true, right? Especially among health care workers. Ny Nyc particular States biggest financial hubs. stock exchange there. Thats world trade center there. 

Getting back functional level massive priority revitalize economy. successful vaccine comes expect NY state one earliest aggressive rollouts. Improper use word should’ve gain fame. “Famous” “Well known” best replacements think “Famous” doesn’t quite fit  Go Oxford! one UK thinks royal family special blood chosen god anything like that. know shes queen chance, hundreds years conflict, inbreeding, scandals, illegitimate children etc. Expect USA.

Triage.

When resources keep people alive limited must choose strongest infected life saving equipment...the rest condemned fates.

&amp;#x200B;

This awaits USA.

Too many cases forced pick choose gets what...which means many dead infected.

However, good news hoax eh? democratic ploy ruin vote? Romulan plot take White House? maybe serious either leader truly incompetent deliberate thinning herd. Dont pay social assistance, disability, pensions dead you? Saves money. God felt soul Yeah thats trump decides take fuck up. say?

It’s almost like context matters something apparently lot meet standard, problem sources mean automatically correct important topics covered.

Unreal! family Florida sold place, moving back Montreal... neighbors jealously angry them... posting numbers without source? mechanism coronavirus's reproduction makes mutate slower flu. We'll see what's case particular virus. Retail workers Woah, woah, woah. Let's let science interfere decision making process. Yeah, thanks. I’d rather take risk Covid potentially harm future child. really hope so

No think realistically people able get Oct-Nov. earliest

Source? add 1 2 months could viable vaccine (even offers temporary protection, makes catching less severe) new year. would world changing.

You need comma period. Also, fucking shit.


This comment pointless. upvoted get Reddit. definitely saw kids behavior focus challenges flourish online learning lots one one tutorials. Oxford vaccine shown generate antibodies, T-Cells.

Usually antibodies go away quick, T-Cells stay incase another infection $AZN 7/20 75C Please respond link respond all.

I'll respond whenever want. you? arguing semantics explained either another random poster non-memorable. overall point was, people get sick long. ultimately irrelevant OVERALL point whether 1 day 2 days even 4 days. 80% people either asymptomatic mild symptoms. FACTS. trying ""gotcha"" impressing anyone. New Zealand control via elimination. great model island country cases, probably realistic anywhere Europe time realized big problem was. Holy crap! Really?!? I’m doctor, psych although keep well field try keep medicine general, don’t pay ton attention infectious diseases endemic areas world. *fantastic* news. say ""New"" relationship taken beating past months even relatively minor disagreements covid. really tough thing deal two exactly page, like normal disagreement. like one wants go dinner party sucks sacrifices 3 hours life reluctantly goes. One person's actions directly affect physical health other, including death. That's really fucking hard obstacle deal with. wasn’t, never got bonus working Well, can’t say sure really rural areas, people talked working out. friend north (I live suburban Saint Louis area) actually lectures recorded burned DVDs/flash drives delivery. That’s definitely option well pursue. NONE ideal, hate even plan drastic actions we’ve seen country. makes physically nauseous actually. 

But humans resilient figuring stuff district district, family family, student student. lasting impacts, need strive innovation mitigates impacts much possible. also need initiatives repairing damage done terms academic progress especially social development youngest students.

Even said though, really talking saving thousands lives here. people dying, limbs amputated, never same... aren’t super sick elderly people. affects us pandemic together. me, comes simple metric. Thousands die go back vaccine ready. younger student parent realized would emotionally devastate going back school. teachers maybe. 

Teachers 100% need front line vaccine we're going in-person schooling. 

Everyone wants kids back school full time. 24% teachers High Risk hospitalization due age and/or medical condition.

If Vaccine legit, get teachers inoculated October, return school full November rest school year. 

Without vaccine, time November flu season hits full force schools shut down. one conspiracy theories really easy verify. want to. want believe believe. already know long term effects covid are, keep finding more.

get vaccine. Good news type vaccine studied SARS years ago too. switched Covid. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Lol grew lived while. understand rural works. point help instead everyone top NYC, despite ""fantastic response"" still incredible amounts deaths hospitalizations.

And Phil also pretty good job I've seen. He's certainly like certain gathering similar views US.

And yes crazies exist course they're much smaller minority. flavor right VT tends encourage social distancing anyway. seriously, need work. Thank explanation Quebec Florida Canada here. Yea, that's best guess that's it. believe Florida overtake California, total number cases, California overtakes New York. Florida abut 1/2 population California, quite achievement. I'm assuming NH mean nursing homes instead new sent recovering patients regardless age. could’ve said Falcons fans Super Bowl. mouse thirsty blood actually dealt situation Italy, America can't even consistently wear masks. America see end till vaccine available. lived Philippines many years saw dirty politics election time. never thought would see US. simply realistic expect 15-30 year olds essentially house arrest virus .02% chance killing them. 

It's feasible. know IDEAL, course would perfect (we) did, going happen.  100%! It’s perfect ride end day it’s fairly long sit there. still think situation resolved much, much longer due amount anti vaxers. takes one stupid parent sending unvaccinated kid ruin progress. He's wrong, even saying people contract severely false. he's catering low intelligence base run statement like explains whole COVID situation. Obviously worse crying China's ""cover up""... like trying same. Yeah 0 active cases two Brits came undid I'm hopefull Oxford vaccine. Astra Zeneca already begun mass production able deliver ~2 Billion doses upon approval. Wtf source lol school offered kids come parking lot internet. Chromebooks. perfect works. also delivered paperwork along lunches breakfast. hahaha ikr imagine believing worlds leading scientists proven there's immune response safe, deploying immediately large-scale trial determines effective immunity is? Best-case start vaccinating two months early kill coronavirus, worst-case vaccine's effective people get different vaccine. enforced exactly? He’s American dude. So, gets earlier trump wins?  Wikipedia usually links sources stuff edited usually made correct updated pretty quickly. Plus pretty easy cross reference stuff find there.

A grateful county salutes Dr Bhattacharya!  Thats mistake TREMENDOUS progress vaccine front, also IFR much lower thought March. There's solid evidence supporting re-infection least 6 months (and counting). Tbf, devil’s favorite demon. Can’t wait fucking anti vaxxers go apeshit whichever vaccine successful. people can't get certain flu shots condition. assume Covid different. protect them, masks required awhile believe.

What's likely? I'm sorry, amount people downplaying getting recently. unfairly chosen sacrificial lamb anger, apologize, right. producers confirmed 300m doses available US September/October. assume distribution vary area, you’d hope decent operation would wide circulation want within couple months.

Edit: saw assumed US, sorry. It’s unclear outside US UK. personally would guess countries would get end 2021. That's include /s. unfortunately believable statement someone would make Pray wins American firm, unless want pay $3000 jab. would surprised see outbreak imported Romania given many people live italy Romania.

But unless close borders, sustainable strategy, need get used imported cases. Keep tracing test isolate. That's do. exceptionally ban flights people come another country. fly frankfurt paris Amsterdam go italy.

So far imported cases people coming back live here. People Bangladesh, Albania, Peru, Brazil, Bulgaria.
Also tourists.. people Netherlands example. would trust Oxford, definitely trust news site came from. [This article reputable news source:  
  Adrian Hill, director Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, said Oxford scientists working laboratory technical side preparation trial team hoped recruit volunteers within hoping challenge trials end year,” said. “This might parallel might phase three trial completed. They’re competing options, they’re complementary.”  
  
None means everyone start getting vaccinated September, like OP's article suggesting:  
  conclusion would line results animal studies released far, even robust immune response confirmed, would guarantee vaccine protected infection. Instead protection could established phase three trial. phase recruited 10,000 trial participants UK, 5,000 Brazil 2,000 South Africa, second trial US aiming recruit many 30,000 timeline phase three trial depends waiting enough participants exposed coronavirus everyday life, reveal whether received vaccine (rather placebo) protected. take months depending infection levels community.  
  said challenge trial, beginning either parallel phase three trial, could provide complementary information optimal dosing administration vaccine, well way test long immunity virus endures exposure agreed supply 100m doses Oxford vaccine Britain, manufacturing plans already begun delivery scheduled September October. AstraZeneca deal provide US 300m doses.  
  
That production mean vaccine track ready go people around world September, means putting together widely available event trials go without problems time rest testing done. Keep mind vaccine AstraZeneca aiming produced September [back phase 2 3 trials need completed rolled public completed vaccine.

Damn can’t stand John Tory makes feel better, havent symptoms since April 13th. longer infect others, cannot infected virus mutates again.

However, groceries...no big deal. Ive mask 8% sour well. mask routering acrylic. mask sandblasting. mask grinding metal. Im american...I wear mask duration Im business. Whoopity-fuckin-dooo!! like theyre asking pierce scrotum ffs. accurate statement. definitely Texas Canada. Hahahahaa. Best luck! got Covid-5 pre Covid-20 Using actual facts one. Death rate still 8 times less New York 200+ cold viruses worth developing vaccine for? many needles would like year? would like cost?

It's one things technically possible unwieldy impractical.  Everyone saying vote- vote dollars. time spend money, choice so. Opt spend money companies pay employees living wage even better, companies locally owned pay living wage. ever important support good jobs local community. I've updated comment, please read. recalled memory.

Thank asking. Maybe prominence renowned? English bit imprecise, could consider making word honestly. I’m invested finding right word now! Oh, yeah, agree going back school normal even option. perhaps kids real options? mention, special needs kids completely ignored discussions. need focused attention working parents provide far online education goes.  ❤️👍🙏 Yeah conspiracies make sense, even looking purely Marxist lens, ruling class would highly motivated get consumers consooming Yeah I'm afraid people hear available sprint open. moved wedding July early November, I'm sure pressure ramp everything wedding wise. hoping avoid big wedding everyone expects. won’t take Bill Gates Vaccine think it’s microchip something. No. must file NDA FDA usually grant PDUfA date get back by. process take 6-12 months post phase 3 readout. Antibodies dont stay around forever, would body need keep antibodies around arent infected? thing matters body remember make antibodies case another infection. SARS SARS antibodies theres good chance test positive SARS-2 antibodies regardless.  Porta-morgue. love idea teaching I've tutor academic helper uni honestly one reasons I've decided continue education teaching UK throws money teachers start career. I'm good teaching want good wage I'm doubting whether I'll actually accept job teacher I've finished training based I've seen far UK. Maybe I'll take training money run (and that, stipulation much teach get teacher training grant, unlike doctors something required teach minimum amount time UK.) It’s wild! different even 5 years ago first diagnosed want articles scientist staff. interesting important info always badly communicated. agree you. Depending scale risk group, would start high risk high vector go high vectors. would widen definition bit include everybody comes contact many people. starts people healthcare industry teachers (given school big topic). also cleaning staff janitors facilities possible high vectors. also said “kids need school” expect covid-linked illnesses children go back. living breathing human 18. think know exactly context 😂

""the parts something written spoken immediately precede follow word passage clarify meaning""

If dive profile, context. read intonaj authors history understand write book, take information readily available i.e. 'context' believe Oxford Uni. vaccine others. Get TV crews ICU's watch suffocate death. UK beginning showing horror Italy. Masks worn, social distancing improve rubbish dark age constipation (or constitution think call team Covid land). Seems pretty stupid install anything like *before hurricane hits even predicted*.

What happens hurricane hits portamorgue? preparation pointless. get Oct/Nov smart thing delay schools out? well. wiped first wash hands arms 2 minutes. sing song know length of. Technically, ""by September"" means September, i.e. end August. mean. cancel public events, can’t exactly “cancel” idea specific day. People wanted big private gathering going them, unfortunately.  recommend facial coverings, like know? Can't use shortage excuse there. he? I'm teacher, would never work. basically insist teachers go anywhere work home valid, unions would never allow that, unless districts give us something BIG return. Also, big reason parents going sending kid back school work. Unless work remotely, exposed to. probably convicting parents manslaughter trying feed family. suppress symptoms you’re really reducing part inflammatory response pathogen, doesn’t necessarily lower viral load saliva mucus could come contact others

I suppose aren’t dribbling much snot might cough sneeze much therefore launch much virus air increasing return. Yes, but: Researchers traced children felt sick. transmission rates asymptomatic cases remains unknown, children less likely adults develop symptoms. Went Home Depot yesterday. Literally everyone inside wearing mask, including small children, except two employees helping purchase order. put face shields talking customer. wore N95 still, worried enough could exposing every customer area. Nearly five months pandemic people still don’t understand droplets transfer air? couldn’t believe it. Oh yeah definitely widespread mask use western world happened Asia sars. lot germaphobes fact included works chimpanzees go crazy  am, absolutely. Know two people died form 30's healthy. Two can't catch breath mild case March. 
Why Americans think data virus exists US? read happens others countries way advanced? main concern mostly long-term. sort testing usually take 6-12 months ensure there's long-term issues? True, think go politicians know kind important, athletes Hollywood stars, nope. Boris initially went ""herd immunity"" world still idea nasty was.

Good thing British government want piss much citizens scientific community backlash.


If power, get Covid early...he strikes British Trump.

 Checks balance working intended. -hint- hint- entire US government covid deniers family. say deaths also fake, in, literally *aren’t* freezer trucks, hospitals empty. news videos fake, numbers fake, etc. Basically, haven’t individually inspected body, therefore don’t exist. Couple poor education, mild paranoia, southern baptism (god take wants, fear), stubborn selfish individualism, ‘liberals pussies’ mentality viola!

So ask *why*..? anyone stand gain conspiracy? answers a) hurt trump, b) hospitals getting paid misreport numbers. ask who’s paying, it’s either something like George Soros/Bill Gates, government itself, compartmentalizing true, trump (and rest world) would paying hospitals harm trump himself. democrats simultaneously completely incompetent, also organizing largest global conspiracy anyone ever seen. It’s completely divorced reality.  It’s way modern society is. People conditioned hate everything around them. think reasonably expect get control point. happens debatable. question/discussion point. 

Do think people learn lesson approach future pandemic threats effectively? repeat mistakes? Usually would say wouldn’t learn mistakes, hopefully traumatic enough learn. 

Also, think lessons learn are? 

I think biggest thing way diligent locking stuff down. outbreak travel place banned immediately. Many countries slow this. lockdowns need severe nation wide (easier said done). live US never really proper nationwide lockdown. states good, many partial needed something like China Italy did. hope learned 4 - 6 weeks total lockdown preferable 6 months back forth situation spiraling. think also illustrated importance nationwide leadership. even risk pandemic everyone wear masks quelled precaution (again national leadership needed here).

As bad could worse disease high mortality rate became pandemic. point would even advocate Carol sick people walking dead.

So learn mistakes? main takeaways be? perspective US, it’s open all.  ""Maybe open massive tourist location would stuff tens thousands people tiny area, including tight indoor air conditioned contact, middle state largest outbreak novel disease pandemic planet""

""Oh GoD LiTeRaLy WaNt Us DiE nEvEr LeAvInG HoMeS LiKe hOlOcAuSt""  fact stories popping occasionally one-offs despite *millions* infections, usually over-sensationalization actually happened (as case), gives confidence reinfection really factor. shared story reinfected Israeli last night. hope folks asked questions see too. 

I think far common currently aware of. Perhaps Israel moreso since population quite homogeneous. may genetic factor aware of. I'm 21 year old boomer I'm letting relatively mild virus effect mental health. Cool. You’re pretty lucky you’ve never adverse reactions flu shoot. feel pretty bad every year day so. concern anti-cpc group, generally younger, trying spread pro-cpc group, tend older. worded way cuz young folks really pro-democracy, older folks may left china communism, see positives china now. social creatures. Asking us stay away months months end asking us fight instincts. young people stupid, taking calculated (and sometimes uncalculated) risks social isolation psychologically emotionally damaging people, even introverts like me. They'd replace half cost fall ill. 
Yes, that's right -- way enough departmental replacements hybrid courses. dumb enough show work, might kill immunocompromised student department chair he/she older 40. 

Some us actually brave re-tooled. give bullshit. reading string comments. doctors Reddit. Lmfao missing /s I'm sure hurricanes season created democrats well. fully believe masks effective. source stats share people know full denial? testify that. quite correct. focus, I'm guessing first round politicians, professional athletes Hollywood stars. bread circus must continue costs! think active dating scene bars clubs open again. Realistically, could become available developing/third world countries currently don’t pre-made deal AstraZeneca (unlike Europe, US UK, obviously)? become available all? essential workers get award.

This coming someone works factory delivers packages(UPS), cant tell many boxes gloves, surgical masks gotten, gotta hundreds thousands since beginning pandemic. convince real...saw lots messed videos China's hospitals morgues. Bodies laying rooms hallways nowhere put doctors screaming crying overwhelmed pleading help, doctors nurses face sores wearing masks...haven't seen shit like yet. Okay cool thanks upvote mean I’m glad know that, time nothing said relevance importance, even answer question. simple connection made related story movie sooooo I’m sure felt like even remotely necessary say things did. Also, “efficient” response would traditionally imply strong reaction immune system

No, efficient immune response one provides protection smaller reaction. covid-19 small children undoubtedly see fewer symptoms smaller antibody response. Let’s see: overall straw man

I brought toddlers that’s talking about. last sentence simply clarify study/the comment replying meat wet bits. It’s good mommy virus.

It’s clear comment know nothing immunology. massive possible differences immune responses groups people. Age **huge** factor many viruses. 

Maybe shouldn’t make public statements medical subject you’ve clearly never even read book about? Oh shit... changes things. one cares. Please, please, much winning. can't take anymore.

 -Donald J. Trump Herd. diminishes opinion can’t get right. want move Vermont right now. Plus, great views famous maple syrup! people sensible causing problems don’t make headlines NM education vote red taking COVID seriously. almost like caring counts something (and big part country even that!). shocking hear sister Hackney Wick social distancing cases reduced 1 meter plus. That’s essentially distancing. Sunday reporting always slow China subsequent outbreaks didn’t report data on, maybe still are, it’s hard know what’s really going agree. 

The possibility exists true fatality rate 1% even 0.5%. Maybe lower, idk. 

Eventually, enough data identify number, yet. 

Long-term effects still understood. could quite bad people. 

In every dimension, sensible policy US masks social distancing. extent CDC guidelines met, opening businesses ok. 

Of course, potus wants define CDC. 

Muthafocker. pandemic quite different ignorance thousands infect kill multiple thousands. 

AIDS pandemic one spreads recedes based public information. People start displaying symptoms anywhere 1 day ~2 weeks. unexpected wearing mask someone virus breathing might also get higher viral load. country embraced distancing, hand washing masks, I'm surprised flu numbers way down. great thing measures good lots viruses. Congratulations yours. didn’t half-arse lockdowns.  two months, everyone stayed fuck home. fined found kilometres home.  possible reason go outside grocery shopping week going working healthcare, grocery finance business. thought anti bodies left body copy weeks. Thought scientists Spain discovered that.

So would work? love face shield, addition instead mask.

They make masks hearing impaired folks now, window lip reading. I'd post link, already Reddit unless adblockers paid subscription.

Glasses sunglasses effective face shields, they're better nothing. Next 

Study: children cats spread Coronavirus effectively middle high schoolers Nice, heard that. Show order says that? Stupidity mainly. consiming ‘news’ internet cable tv since probably 1992 (we call internet days) no, not. reddit, among sites certainly adds efficiency process, however. makes sense

I meant regards producing big enough viral load infect others easily 

It seemed like research still unclear whether asymptomatic/mildly ill people easy time infecting others symptomatic people believe happen congress mandates paid sick leave employees. Yes, employers offer work place. People still come sick. Yes. trying achieve herd immunity bad idea. still possibility Boomer perfect word way, crazy. new, water wet, grass green, everyone US fucking stupid.  spend probably ~4 hours per day reading NFL news I’ve googling fairly constantly since comment posted, yet find anything supporting (to fair it’s kinda hard find anything related kneeling keywords “Kaepernick” “racism” it). I’m starting become skeptical Kaep “open racist,” honestly kills faith humanity little someone would something evil calling someone racist solely vehicle support point.

If saw headline “Tom Hanks volunteers black community” assure nobody would comments throwing hissy fit Hanks racist didn’t volunteer white community. 

Let people help others. ""It's fair"" emotional argument them. None fair kids. still reason situations. I'm sorry going that. replies become Trump's fault.... also naive assume smartass two slapping kids getting others personal space screaming ""coronavirus"" shits giggles. weekends, get dozens people Charlotte Raleigh come visit boats. places virus hot spots, come good time maybe they’re drinking. would see signs, open front door, yell: “F--- masks. F--- you.” would walk in, refuse wear mask dump merchandise counter. guy come mask pistol hip stare down. guy took T-shirt put mouth could see whole stomach. “There. mask. happy?” lady tried tape pamphlet front window ADA mask exemption, totally fake thing. It’s conspiracy theory, it’s become popular here. kept saying discriminating people disabilities. What? Why? How? None say sounds logical. can’t make sense half names call me. say I’m uneducated — uh, that’s kind ironic. say I’m sheep. I’ve brainwashed. I’m pushing government propaganda. I’m suffocating them. I’m part deep state. I’m agent World Health Organization. “How like muzzle?” “Is going become sharia law?” “Are prepping us wear burqas?” “What’s next? Mind control?”

Yeah, we're fucked. Hope rushed Vaccine works. Vaccines always good never harm. Anyone disagrees anti-vax lunatic. Um, shit? high school graduated entire volleyball time go virus. think filters would get gunked up. sure that. 

This really great hospitals need toss entire n95. people need wear filtered mAsk makes lot sense. comparing price washable masks lay people currently wearing. I’m embarrassed say this. Really am. imagine moment, combined 4 countries (with 90-100 million fewer people USA) think chart would look then? comprehend? man enough admit mistake? I’m saying it’s right... like, ""Let's reopen live it"" people trying weaponize doomers.  simply honest said ""We enough masks, please hoard them"" (meaning buy them) we'd fine.

No, everyone would hoarded them. There'd billions face masks sitting people's damp basements sold wallmart parking lots $20 each, hospitals enough doctors. Hawaii strict - remote limited medical rwaources Yes. small business livelihood. That’s feed families. 

We weren’t talking student loan debt. Combination ignorance fixation told March. no.1 reason hear people. It’s beautiful love it. Can't plan end world man. tracks phone, you. 

So, you’re actually paranoid easily fake location leaving phone behind, etc. No, let's go back January 23rd, representatives Chinese national government went Chinese national TV told 1.4 billion people wear fucking masks. 

They knew. Also 600k worldwide lockdown. went business normal would explode could rival 18M causes. Sure Cuomo sending sick elderly people back nursing homes “correct” thing do. Oh, do. wait, new government approved wheel sold tax payers 200x markup used government vehicles.   Wow, opinions facts. Try again. Let's speed train thought get boy bubble level protection. called ""Old Duesseldorf"", old German beer that's brewed Maryland. hard get Island. Fuck every single one dipshit supporters.  Firstly, tried going run mask on, saying couldn’t it?

Secondly, part problem wearing mask exercise breathing become burdened draw air mask. Additionally, masks trap warmth exhales face mask’s material. continue breath move around, new air come mix displace less oxygenated air exhaled. southern states, California done decent job.

Why think New York done well deaths 2nd deaths per million? Yeah voter fraud. people voting means less GOP victories. autotldr bot need ? though there’s mistaking that. It’s blown way proportion. Sorry. ever people conditioned social distancing it’s friends northern mountains. think good time point ridiculous academia media surrounding is.
We’re putting post “MIT RESEARCHERS” made mask
Like mean? subtly trying attribute reusable filter masks MIT researchers?
This looks bad MIT researchers community giving much press that’s fucking issue every single field science. old white men get attention. work others doesn’t matter isn’t worth talking old white man MIT picks up. Guess they're taking statement ""reinventing wheel"" heart They’re like wow full customers. We’re winning much! Please stop! !**autotldr** many new tests perform AZ hospitals full sending people states. don’t see good news flattening hospital max, I’d put bad news. u/autotldr Ooooh that's mouthy little snowflake. Step back people. I'm still learning use three seashells. Increased work breathing. still pull amount oxygen, end working bit harder. Lol choice riot. Technically, **is** third...

Not promoting violance way, rather suprised one pulled JFK yet. believe democracy seems stronger democracy itself, crumbling fast. model? gotta kidding glad we're page. Yet set host ton NHL games. matter serious virus gets, can't mess hockey here, lol.   Guess they’ve still run toilet roll round way got 25%, pool testing 4 samples time could take tests testing individual samples.

i.e. 20 samples 25% positive, would 5 positive samples average. pool 4 samples, would need 5 batches. worst case, 1 positive pool initial 5 tests clear anyone, end need test sample individually. Total 25 tests.

But percentage drops, like example 5%, pool 20 would one positive. 5 tests would clear 16 people 4 tests would needed clear positive batch/ halving number tests 9.  don’t time read actual paper. one read paper tell me, result adjusted probability 0-9 year old outside household without parent/guardian 10-19 yo outside alone? critical priors justify result.  two party system. Therefore often support someone hate alternative party. Add many one issue voters lead people vote bad leaders support whatever issue important them. 50% alternating schedule - Monday/Wednesday Tuesday/Thursday, Fridays all-day Zoom elearning type stuff.

Cancel sports, band, choir, recess, convictions, awards, after-school clubs, open house, parent-teacher conferences. Also, 100% masked adults kids, exceptions. 1 kid per bus seat max, exceptions. library gym art. Absolutely sharing objects shared surfaces.

And students teachers could teach home deemed unsafe. Jesus what's wrong you? elections years come covid like infects humans isn’t idiocy anymore, pure criminal behavior. tried manslaughter. insanity.

Fuck dipshit supporters. Vermont right living near popular city. Literally everyone wearing mask town. picked prescription local pharmacy knock front door say name slot, opened enough hand prescription left. state gets it. Mask bullshit ! believe publicly stated joking said inject bleach. nuanced humor. probably get it. 🥴 Butttt webmd said addictive /s ... Almost idiotic thinking mask prevents catching virus. mask isn’t it’s others. reduces transmission little prevent infection. honestly many people’s mentality. eh problem. social responsibility deplete hospital resources. thats joke dude boston one tiniest cities (by area) country higher population VT. get deal is. vermont rural. course empty wyoming large prairie states. still big chunk land smaller population single city  kids parents/grandparents hide real death rate keep hoax going. 

I would bet large sum money today, real death rate done less 0.1%. average flu death rate. everyone that. many died going school sick? Fear shut nation. difference went school media doesnt spread fear 24/7 TV. People lived. Really? ok gotta get some. No, began military career 1785. nothing French governance years Louis XVI's head landed wicker basket. US rushing Disney World set new records daily basis.

That's Canada taking extra precaution played around prototypes found moved filters far center meet requirements N95 rating? get coming from, clear mask see mouth filters hung around lower cheek would great. ss, source long term effects asymptomatic cases? see mentioned article Sueing different Canada ""New study Trump's FDA indicates one Coke Zero (TM) day keep COVID Bay! Buy six-pack nearest Wal-Mart everyone else catches onto simple trick!""1 This. sound like one ""very rare"" 2x childhood chickenpox cases. shingles yet. first case likely simply mild activate immunity fully. wrote song looking oh, oh
Yet virus swing low
And trump go
Da da, da ra ra da, da, da silly, that's problem future people! Except reason blue jays allowed come back... training camps. You’re definitely right. New Zealand germany bunch others. Still Korea unarguably among leaders continues be. like ever happened US. 
 
The CDC estimates US 60M cases H1N1 2009 pandemic. little 10 years ago. don’t know true number many states didn’t test throughly. Why?! 

What purpose serve exactly!? progress made ALL. don’t give tinkers damn interested in. care future know got none. Hmmm riots spreading virus yet small rally did......

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, morons fuck off.  important part including teachers employees, brought schools, are, end, closed spaces,” said, underscoring finding middle-school children proved dangerous vectors.  younger students obedient easier control classroom setting,” Khatib said, “and respect teachers. Among high schoolers, greater ability understand. nature middle-school kids rebel, obey teachers, wear masks keep apart.”

His comment behavior rather biology, certainly interesting. idiot thought virus hoax shocked he's sick?


You clearly read article. Hell, put effort enough get 3rd sentence clear didn't, read headline used form incorrect view situation. headline using 'shocked' context. shocked tested positive, shocked first governor get now. also goes say akin achy cold. Democratic, real time impeachment! tracing really matter point? whole number percentages population infected hoping accomplish figuring someone got infected? might well assume everyone infected point. family friends households -- chatting, laughing, great time -- precisely virus spreads. That's State's stay-at-home order banning gatherings among people different households order, simply advice,"" read statement county. like want entire country implode. insane. realize top 4 New Jersey? Lmao think comment OP want credit. Good job OP's downstairs colleagues printing masks! We're together! think hospitals going handle influx cases opening schools? could measly disease mind take away lives purest happiest people?! Hope get better soon. I'm also one long haulers. Brutal process far. symptoms started beginning March. improvement along way, constant reality checks.

I find I'm probably better lot long haulers sense I'm able function now, I'm like 50% pre covid. tried 2 hour hike used run up, made 30mins walking slow pace (took 1 hour section) hit crippling wall fatigue throwing up. turnaround point. 

It's really humbling see 4 months illness I'm still close normal. 

Wishing best recovery. really hope people like guy replied stop dismissing cases like us. There's evidence long-haulers studies done. mean millennials generation know memes wanting kill there's answer. Except catch don’t wear mask likely spread others. becomes life threatening put hospital staff risk. Sadly... exactly expect see every city town across entire US fall/winter unless cheap easy manufacture (or find) viable treatment found.

States zero choice shut down. option. could avoid worst get control Sept/Oct. seeing many governors anti-lockdown even states control many areas, don’t see happening.

Not doom gloom. It’s want see happen country. shit, look happened previous pandemics time. look virus gaining steam inch closer fall winter, expected many scientists beyond horrible. else expect see happen based data today? submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* mean think one would take Covid seriously chance would die war? welcome! Sorry better news. right; removal transparency control narrative time handling entire situation incompetently going continue get people killed. could've thousand deaths.
But give hope entirely! There's places look it. top right now. (One friends Finland went amusement park. Without mask! cases control transmitted anymore.) Covid cause heart attacks stroke though, may wanna take one out. Isn’t Bernie Sanders guy Vermont Senator? 🤔 Upvote post! Thanks info!   still ignorance. fails remember pandemic worsens, face reduced support even corporates, let alone fanatical supporters (who small minority whole).

It's still malice sense thinks cruelty *work* though. again, knows get away failure cruelty, that's matters him. suing Atlanta mayor mandating masks city! 🤯 rural Oregon like 🙃 One MANY downsides COVID death pretty much live music.

As side note, lot artists streaming via Twitch live streaming services now. I’ve seen great shows past months discovered several artists probably wouldn’t discovered otherwise. Great live music *is* there. would find hard justify limiting existence anyone support admin. dont agree lot left insanity right fallen love corrupt idiot (independent pov)

Single issue voters utter demonization Democrats. I’m saying shouldn’t surprising someone got didn’t wear mask... wearing mask like jumping plane parachute. wonder many pandemics find about, never end gravely effecting America. Part made deadly US used pandemics effecting us. imagine often hear assume like Ebola non factor here. Yo, motherfucker actually deleted account two months. High fiving Abbott way future people push future people future. those? Well that's problem, deal important things like ""pro-life"" long exercise power women complain immigrants stealing jobs aswell lazy willing work. Damn women immigrants. *shakes fist angrily* nearly much states. Again, part make sense you? calling people think let kids starve? comparison rest country NY done great job handling virus thats extremely low bar. 

I'm Brooklyn late react knew back February. folks live upstate schools shut city. I'm public high school teacher cleaned building once. told us early March end February disinfecting classrooms school confirmed case would shut least 24 hours throughly disinfected. Neither happened. classrooms clearly weren’t cleaned let alone disinfected. high school next mine confirmed case early March shut school even day. returned building first week shut down- extremely clear again, disinfected school, clear end June returned close room. 
My class chosen participate Hamilton education program went March 11th- cancel trip. night Broadway shut still open. second week March several teacher know, including myself, set online classrooms school numbers low anxiety viruses, kids staying home, distracted air day long break- would reopening schools, especitally hybrid model much better online learning, much better it’s worth risk life? that's another issue 
 Teachers petitioned weekend last minute Sunday decision March 16th close NYC schools. 
That late, asking action taken weeks promised health considered taking measures clear never actually took measures. least 74 DOE employees died due COVID, 30 teachers.

They told people dont come work sick, take sick days CAR. doctors note saying COVID fine but, March testing NYC readily available. called get tested March, left info NYS health department, called back week later schedule drive thru apt later week (nearly 2 weeks since called since exposed) said car, asked could borrow one. say live Brooklyn cars like that. said they'd call back clinic apt. 3 weeks since first called symptoms. People told come lost sick days told theyd still getting tested city doosy. 

They've lying cleaning subways (they clean cleaning stations trains like say they've been). shutting subway 1am-5am cleaning it, cause I've 5am train. cleaning subways, March, April, either. show photo op. subway 5am sticky uncleaned floor. 120 MTA employees died due COVID. spray clean stations service wealthiest/important people. 

A restaurant Park Slope indoor service since memorial day, NYC phases. Indoor food service allowed anywhere state
BUT less month ago, June, queer Latinx bar Sunset Park, following guidelines window service shut one night nypd bars Park Slope people crowding sidewalks drinking, since memorial day. 

There underground clubs parties city April on. 
At direct action midtown week, saw white limo passed slowed down, checking see anyone wanted in. disco ball back bunch colorful lights = party limo. one ways people going underground, dangerous, socially irresponsible nightclubs going city April on. 
The thing is, 1000% clear limo was. several articles clubs.

NY NYC particular seemingly taken dramatic steps flatten curve. March April streets ghost towns started getting warm, right leading memorial day lot ""being good"" went shit. even entirely blame people. leadership. daily Como press conferences dropped off. Memorial day, went Jones Beach long Island. people gonna good long own. made sacrifices city, lost family get folks especially kids want return normal leaders go silent, good long. 

The biggest frustration praising treated virus difference enforcement protests versus pandemic/public health restrictions blatantly disgusting. action taken people crowded boardwalks parks early May April. ""I can't enforce mask wearing social distancing""- Como. time De Blasio sent cops threatened hasidic jews Williamsburg large funeral (over thousand people nothing social distancing public parks lower Manhattan), women subway thrown ground arrested properly wearing mask had. April

The protests started Como put 8pm curfew place. NYPD kettled protesters, shut subways 7, locked citi bikes 7, shut ride share apps 7, beat arrested complying curfew certain spots peaceful protests taking place. target protesters, arrested essential workers jobs. week city ordered food 6pm, putting delivery persons life lively hood risk. tracking protesters based pictures one following party limo midtown? 

In city alone 32,029 deaths. That’s 11x causalities 9-11. NYC 11 9-11s 6 months. 137K deaths entire country. That’s 25% population state Wyoming. people lost loved ones able mourn ‘regularly’ nation able mourn all.

 10 blocks away parking lot full trucks full bodies moved trucks daytime. 10 miles away fresh mass graves Hart Island. 

My co teacher it. it. I'm lucky okay health ""mild"" cases means anything low key symptoms bad able breathe without assistance. co workers lost family members, students lost family members. 

It terrifying. Even mildly anf genuinely mild, know gonna get worse one day. tell roommates meant got it- worse part (again lucky) exposed people without knowing passed virus. 


The bar low. 
I'm terrified go back school September. comment intended somewhat silly draw image Satan cultural archetype rather religious figure. made mention satanism certainly mean disparage good name individual satanist. Apologies misunderstanding, offence, hurt feelings. many deaths could prevented reopening later glad see hate much haha joys never developing object permanence. See Monday (technically Tuesday, backlog hell drug) 90k+ cases Run hundred times whoever infects spreading, whoever infect, on, see stopping one case mean lot. commonplace like flu /s They're betting wrecks urban residents enough they're crippled vote come November.  Haha MIT didn’t solve problem headline trash like post. Anger gift. Definitely Obama’s fault. Vietnam currently world leader tests per confirmed case. [This fairly recent, data tests per confirmed case 9 May. According that, number 966 tests per confirmed case, 6 times second-highest country, New Zealand. I’m mid 20s work 3x per week. sure *exactly* normal bpm is, it’s certainly 100+.

People react differently covid. catch it, maybe I’ll experience symptoms weekend. saying 100%?

Even masks conferred 2% protection wearer, headline/result still stands hilarious sad. 

And remember, man people required wear them, including whoever gave disease. one bit. bad perspective initially thought. give date Performance Improvement department responsible submitting. determined needed two additional data points me, ED visits ED visits related COVID-19 (suspected confirmed cases). However additional wording change FEMA HHS version allows us change reporting time frame something choosing... limping along operational reporting framework submit same-day data, new wording letting completely re-write entire suite reports one single report that's tidy. me, that's 20 hours work lead testable reports easily changed later on. PI, that's possibly going save hours work day.

However, also additional data needed can't get me. There's new data points regarding materials (stock) personnel, including future staffing predictions. idea they're going get info never asked I'm trying untangle months work.

The recent head scratcher is... what's ""pediatric"" patient per new report? long history NHSN, new portal HHS may define pediatric patient differently. patient 18? based date report date admission? ticket submitted response.

Long story short, every change agency means definitions change, needs reassesed. format output needs reassessed. New data points need negotiated. Nothing assumed.

Meanwhile, well aware politics related change, that's nothing control. became Consul Life 1802. on, power dictator. One Napoleon's important reforms code laws. Called Napoleonic Code, laws ensured several principles revolution, including equality male citizens law, end Three Estates, right property. People could practice religion choice.

I suppose lead whole time misleading. However code laws established would forever change politics.

Unfortunately lead downfall exiled losing 570,000 men russian winter. saw schools ""plan"". plan ""fuck it, dont worry unless something pops up!""

Fuck that. send kids something dont even want go myself. asked regrets choice wearing mask says doesn’t “second guess” himself... dude can’t look self critically. shouldn’t office. yeah no, perfect time complain it. Instead salty downstairs neighbors get headline could help make masks available community. apply grants expand production. know way easier complain MIT. ... Wyoming, everywhere urban people.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* keep trying tell people states managed well! live another one states it’s dramatic distance I’m hearing outbreak states right now. US really like bunch separate countries sometimes. America “greatest” country 50’s, 60’s, 70’s collapsing since. Russia, Russia notably flawed US. (Obviously US still problems period though... did.) 

Those days long gone imagine helps explains large divide younger older generations today. Also perhaps conservatives mostly older- conservatism makes since world superpower? thinks men missing rib, too. obvious epidemiologists pandemic. relived masks effective public use. *is* nothing hold grudges lives line. 

Stay safe mate. Thank intellectual prowess leopards eat respective faces. Agreed, schools shouldn’t hasty reopen  honestly think part Trump lax controlling virus knows kills black people more. probably thinks he's culling people vote him. billionaires actually philanthropic. sort problem late stage capitalism.  fucking stupid. even far Elmhurst, literal epicenter NYC outbreak. people ridiculous. Here’s really works. can’t come you’re sick? Okay you’re fired because....you’re team player. made thing. stupid hell. 2 weeks paid leave? Sure. They’re going pocket money fire end. much magic mask, ""guy take even basic steps protect even little bit, refused impose mask mandates state, surprised contracts virus."" Us idiots standards may die - least they'll outbreed you!... use mask home?  Governor called 30 days stay home prayer work &amp; necessities life wearing mask outside home might actually work reduce covid-19.

If prayer alone protective churches around world would super spreader sites. even embarrassment, beyond now. Shame. That's that's left. People wearing masks voluntarily. stay like too, even mandate.

That said, can’t help wonder much Vermont white plays role. far black Hispanic people far likely die whites. “If get people stop eating bit, means less people going shopping time. transmission could shoot plan succeeds.” getting schooled here, admire perseverance. Acting defending ""corona-party"" bold attempt straw man, fall it. 

You expand bag rhetorical tricks keep trying, maybe choose arguments better? Arguing there's spike MN daily death rate dropped 25 5 losing argument get-go, MN's big protests month ago yet...daily death rate remains low! 

Wooooo Minnesota! burnt offerings? always seemed work antiquity. sacrificing virgin? KNOW! Let’s shave heads sing “Kumbaya” around ceremonial fire! economy SAVED! 

Let’s pull stops searching solution dreamland. :/ 100% USA. Drive car step directlystart swimming without walk. many cars beach.

Solution covid problems? make parking illegal beach. soon people walk meters would stay home. And, fools follow fools follow fools?

It's turtles way down! Really love asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

Lovely. Usually someone position like would least pretend critical thinking skills. hunt help feed family dad layed 08 recession. telling someone chill fucking hilarious. infect essential employees choice way out. actual red hats, eh cares. lung damage stuff actually happens flu well, heals. result closing kyabakuras soaplands... look map, tokyo, osaka fukuoka... coincidence. read first half comment upvoted went back main feed. build fuckery forcing covoid positive old people back nursing homes thousands deaths went coward. stumbled r/MaskSkepticism day really ""I truly get it"" understatement...

WTF going on?!? dont know Americans. would massively hoarding anyway. find really hard care allow explain downvoting. work restaurant company refuse actually anything employees example several restaurants breakouts. 3 coworkers literally went state wedding vacation. instead right, smart thing mandate 14 day quarantine, keep living life. Meanwhile instead forcing idiots wear masks get punished kitchen wear it’s humid hot work normally, without mask. care, damn it’s hard. go overboard virus, human coronavirus mega aids. high school power went right school started school LITERALLY CALLED HOME told parents pick us up. dad thought lying refused pick up. everyone left went bio teachers class got groped first time life. thanks dad. Voter fraud real. Ballots lot easier tamper mail transit sysyem. Last weeks 4 arrest made New Jersey officials caught committing ballot fraud mail ballots local elections. people voting small group people voting multiple times election.  /r/UpliftingNews place go, then. Mine took 16!! addressed issue said rates transmission could go school closure ends. New York likely reason spread far wide quickly US. handling catastrophic. forced retirement homes take coronavirus patients, thus killing retirees. Peak clownery. wrote angry rant [about Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea's response Ebola height West African Ebola epidemic parallels USA's yesterday sheer anger rage. 

The really sad thing left West Africa summer greater appreciation fact USA better equipped crisis. Instead government handled even worse. Let break little bit more: Trump old man, leader. role offer ideas direct efforts, know anything feasible, especially specialized medicine. rambles little sometimes, is.

People drank bleach cause they're stupid(see drinking bleach). comment Trump made inspire asking way disinfect lungs something, like bleach. referring cleaning wound, like using hydrogen peroxide cut, intense. think stupid foolish.

Hydroxychloroquine pretty mild mannered own, used treat Malaria. Trump come treatment, tentatively effective according several news outlets doctors. serious side effects occur heart problems, using anymore, since heart problems hard detect. (good, imo) PR move try keep hopes high, put focus treatment could work. Again, directing resources throwing ideas.

The idea Covid would gone Easter mostly general media March, got serious. Trump impeached, media downplaying Covid ""no worse flu,"" ""a small outbreak."" Trump said, ""it'll fine,"" news changed (because media really biased Trump, rarely agrees even reported information week prior), Covid 'the worst disease ever,' 'so many people going die like black plague.'

There might hundreds examples, think there's hundreds reasonable explanations things way are. Also Trump bit open tv, little dumb things. issues, especially bigger ones, perfectly reasonable. media spins lot, people rarely easy access entire context, ready access unbiased journalism. Pretty easy lie/be ignorant one listens call them(the media) out. Simply put, yes. There's also aspect getting used simply deny reality away, work something like virus mercy care politics beliefs. They've riding simply denying facts pretending nothing wrong 4 years now. sandwiched three former covid hot spots; Quebec epicenter Canadian outbreak back border still open, border NY well. We’ve done pretty well opening slowly deliberate manner know we're screwed Doctor, Timelord travel space time, bewildered. Hi Vermont Massachusetts, hope ya doin good. People seem think going get really sick... imagine get Boris Johnson full monty virus get little cough nothing more... going even less inclined anything slow spread feel anything worry about. 3/5.  It’s best interest Confederacy.  Trump help GOP, carrying south tried failed 160 years ago...destroy federal government. 

They finally figured it, eroding within fails completely.

Nothing else makes clear sense this, aligns everything seeing since took office. isn’t dumb. corrupt. doesn’t believe anything says. Back virus started wore single glove upside mask. 

Ex: made WWE wrestling “essential” Florida. wife owner WWE runs trumps biggest super pac. donated bunch money day.

He also worships trump 

[campaign Vermonter here. Corona hit nation talking people would need distance neighbors, keep gather large numbers.

In Vermont said ""So, life normal?"" turned nursing homes death camps killed thousands misusing ventilators. death rate criminally high.

Fauxci evil deep state swamp rat. don’t think Americans, Oklahomans particularly, want bunker place next 24 months.”

Yeah, shit sherlock. Put goddam mask to. bad... completely misinterpreted message. thought arguing previous points saying make sense 2 things listed above.

I agree saying. Thank God fetuses!

Babies suck Texas. masks protect person, person wearing it

I get people double-speak like this, helping

he caught he's moron thinks hoax, wear mask, he's around people wearing masks also think hoax 3/5 white American. -S.Miller. Huh? not? get ER, person helping call ahead.

If don't, putting people risk showing forcing way forgot phones work. Last letter Gates foundation read literally started arguing idea overpopulation thing main problem world. insane mortality decreasing good thing long life similarly so. Half much transmission *when schools closed.* Kids 10 really many social interactions outside immediate so, number new infections seeded children may rise schools reopen, study authors cautioned. “Young children may show higher attack rates school closure ends, contributing community transmission Covid-19,” wrote. studies also suggested large number contacts schoolchildren, interact dozens others good part day, may* [*cancel smaller *of infecting others.*  shit? governor agree stitt dumb Never happened stop repeating lies. Go r/covid19positive well. lot useful information future, screwed right now. 

Nationalize N95 mask production able supply workers close contact others. 

Ramp test/trace/contact efforts find isolate positives. 

No indoor activities require mask removed. 

Lower threshold stay home orders. absolutely around masks on, community following guidelines way deal it. 

Provide quarantine locations isolate positives. outbreaks due shared housing arrangements. 

OSHA guidance issued enforced businesses. 

Immediate research guidance issued around air exchangers (AC/Heat/Fans) closed rooms. 

 Really though need everybody wear dam masks! Stitt. This. incompetence, pure malice. one likes best, think safe, wrong? don’t believe news much. news agencies lie, country’s news agencies lie, China lies. longer track record telling truth culture deception I’ll start trusting Well highlights going happen state reopen schools. probably get job, probably got one kids lets face facts one wears mask social distances home. happened happening everyone across state school reopen. hit global economy. FTFY im expert epidemiology way; but, 4 tests pool imply expecting 1 4 people/tests tested positive? play silly games. worse airport game count LAX forget NYC three international count city itself, LA 4 million NYC 8.4M. want use entire metro area, NYC's equivalent metro area closer 18M.

Where seen numbers LA city? Every official number ever seen goes LA happy talk ""cases"" fit preferred conclusion. Curious. we're going argue ""deadlier"" means, simultaneously want convince NYC suffered death incompetence also less deadly virus time. 

I mentioned cases showcase higher percentage deaths compared cases. know didnt understand that. Death mortality rates matter number cases. care less 100 million people get certain virus killing seriously injuring long term. 

Using logic, honest mention population density. I'm Jewish cremation offensive. want know well see problem that. YouTube either morons, care assisting could easily identify kind misinformation.  know, actually can't argue that. I’m part!

For Horde! China tested entire city Wuhan 10 11 days believe. get together here? Pool testing getting done much higher scale prayers chance hell finding far it’s spread, try contain it. work roadside assistance company Orange County. three women give attitude wearing face mask changed tire yesterday. asked wear it, responded “I wear because...” cut saying “ Don’t tell it’s law, isn’t.” explained interact 25 people day since whole thing started, scoffed treated like shit. confirm, absolutely crazy people here. 

My favorite thing roll say “do mind don’t wear mask?” I’m glad haven’t gotten sick gotten kids 67 year old mother sick. Fuck people. son told beginning 3rd grade wanted get perfect attendance award, helped push towards it. plenty days feel like going sent anyway said could school call feel better. Luckily, good year illnesses besides cold there. (I would never send fever/vomiting) end year came got certificate pizza party library cold pizza warm soda. want try next year. simply true misusing stats trying sound smart. could apply argument coronavirus comparison case. guys getting really pathetic. numbers matter make sense anyone presented would understand argument good luck BS. Resorting pretentious dismantle simple comparison makes sense embarrassingly pathetic. Alanna Davison. second, nice choice.  think analogy voting whoever comes closer works well here. I'm also incredibly disappointed election cycle nominee Democratic party, also know real impacts happens people look like dire election swing way hope does. 

No wonder youth voter turnout spurred. Pouring energy uphill battle see hope crushed vote self-interest perfect recipe nihilism. People like McConnell know they're conmen. lot younger ones kool-aid drinkers. 2 labs end next week, “additional labs follow” whatever means. Defiantly hit balls hammer neoliberal politicians like Biden times now... TPP would hit balls... wars would hit balls... healthcare system leaves uninsured bankrupt hit balls... mention crime bill pushed hard ya pretty major hit balls too... owned hospitals

Well there’s problem right really think every senior flu recovers hospital?

Lol And/or pathological inability feel empathy and/or ego dimension can't admit mistake even face fact singularly responsible constituent deaths. Hard know though effect practical purposes. 40 away highest peak first wave. We'll probably 700 next week. ask put nursing home patients constantly bounced back forth hospitals begin with?

Let get straight. Cuomo ask hospital ship come him, build emergency hospitals, demand 40k ventilators Trump can't find place put highly contagious people that's back nursing home??? trump done reddit would calling literally hitler. pretty close..? 50, certainly. Obviously we're exceptionally rural.

edit: idea controversial. VT quite comfortably middle 50% data points here. I've lived life, one rural parts state (though quite rural NEK). always see people walking around towns otherwise driving around. could probably go max 5 minutes driving without seeing another house. never particularly far another person. even remotely like Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, etc. Y'all bizarre misconceptions. Politicians never admit wrong. Remember Cuomo executive order forced nursing homes accepted infected patients, resulted tens thousands old people getting infected dying still never admitted wrong. Politicians never admit screwed know next election comes along little soundbite saying wrong played back endlessly impact ability get re-elected. Exactly, think warmth bothers me. I've taken wearing tank top wear mask try stay bit cooler. 

I lucky work home, pretty much go grocery store. Yeah, annoying comfortable, like hour every two weeks, hardly like put rack. Save... what? 


Like, save money, got where?  Surprise surprise surprise doing? Logical comments allowed reddit. Follow sheep bow might Fauci.

If says 35k killed best way execute covid must right. Fauci never wrong before...NEVER! San Francisco people wear masks protest events. Seems like got agenda realize Trump fighting mail ballots voter fraud right. implying Trump's new Post Master General paid commit voter fraud via mail ballot system left pushing Trump fighting stop. would Trump fight stop mail voting system rigging favor? rest America could literally nothing maintain death rate next 2 years still touch amount deaths NJ NY. Idc you’re talking about, states handled pandemic bad possible. trump made EO put coronavirus patients nursing homes he’d accused genocide right get documents. Documents everywhere, they're really quite common. Try let go anxiety outdoor activities. chances infection outside sunny day, aren’t dense crowd, low.

Maybe go (not crowded) beach pack fancy picnic? drive bit find open spot, biggie. Getting safely worth Sure, ok 👌 Zero, they're counting anyone infected bases.  a) vetoed paid family &amp; medical leave january 2020, would've godsend right now

b) beat hallquist, ran updating internet infrastructure... would've godsend right now.

c) completely botched move legalize marijuana wasted opportunity make niche market...... would've godsend right now.

d) mask mandate -- honestly, *all* republicans, matter ""moderate"" are, play fucking ideology games public health? vermonters special. natural immunity virus. wildly better people infinitely responsible americans. already spreading, going get worse fall, especially leaf peepers. 

e) reopening schools. million guidelines someone starts displaying symptoms, single damn peep asymptomatic carriers. going complete disaster, we're pretending like contain virus completely ignoring spread happens without symptoms. combine reopening schools flood tourism... we're mega-fucked.

That's I'm figuring looking somewhere would test me. easy take get tested believe since it'll doctor call severely unpleasant babies since understand something shoved noses Cremation seems 100% effective killing virus Tell fellow countrymen stop acting like fucking imbeciles then. 100% exactly states taunted NY told NY many democrats help Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Because unfortunately, thanks vast majority households 2-person income now, single parents, school effectively become inexpensive daycare facility them. places could drop kids they'd looked (could younger adult low risk severe illness keep eye them) good internet connection kids connect teachers, without costing anything extra, they'd probably okay online schools. really could forage food millionaire.  I'm part! Again, fair enough. course lie, say do. I'm trying defend ccp, think China would better place without them. reports current numbers, foreigner lives China, believe pretty accurate. city live close 20 million people new local cases months now. friends parts country say thing. wait, really say that? so, watch it. literally basics causal inference understanding. ""gold standard"" causal research use randomly selected members studied population create two large groups identical, applying treatment one group (to see outcome would treatment applied treatment group).

Here, we'd ideally want compare two outcomes: New York's COVID deaths New York approach New York's COVID deaths Swedish approach.

Again, that's ideal. Now, reason think Sweden New York identical (or incredibly similar) pre-COVID whatever ways important determining transmission virus, etc., hey, good argument straight comparison.

But could also think New York's death rate would look followed Swedish approach, would likely increase transmission death count, etc. 

Or maybe that's asking much you. Hope gets symptomatic...  Don’t ignorant. argue NY largest gateway country. got fucked kept getting fucked. always bad apples majority people know work/school/church/wherever taking serious wearing masks. rest country time learn morons declaring Covid non issue. affects someone life, go ahead continue shit people follow science facts trying help slow awful plague. Credit Korea. countries could emulate success. say New York City, failed horribly early on. “government” offered worse nothing.

I’m envious. That’s odd...neither people know issue surgical masks, actually wear surgical masks winter Asian countries prevent sore throats colds. may want check surgical masks genuine counterfeit ones, many fake / non-standard / poor quality masks sold last months. Condolences died due others' carelessness. 140k huge. Next week, US discovers 'wheels' help move things. leaders children? Yep, way governors New York, Michigan, California, Washington, Illinois that's sure. literally British newspaper too! Yes, there's lot uncertainty life, much unproven vaccine. point trying make?

Some people ok sorts risks. would totally ok phase 3 trial, knowing there's chance I'll die severely hurt. I'm ok that. It’s true don’t argue imaginary friend (sad face) Sue doctor Go California, please. beginning, Kentucky governor, Indiana governor, ohio governor, sort alliance got together agree lockdown measures share resources, fell away within month's time. wear cloth mask ported N95.

PPP already going ruin economy. kid, take seriously. thought big deal, went phase frequently, checked cardiologist. first time talked someone adult. cardiologist explained child, procedures high risk low reward, that's probably recommended. low risk high reward, recommend now. 

So so, check-in cardiologist. Things changed lot last 20 years.

Stopping five Valium tablets Thailand wherever way important thousands amoxicillin pills sold OTC (because that's done countries) getting unchecked. okay. tell this, knew?  Good job Vermont happened SARS vaccine? know read? link, 17k people affected white... 42k white. majority latino black.   I've noticed randomly coughing (unintentionally) causes people distance more. Well, keeping child home NC announced half schooling school. way. exposed, exposed.  *barely* bottom 40%... obviously way closer median bottom. gonna say SC extremely urban distance median, #19?

31 *not* far away 25. Like, understand I'm saying VT actually hyper-urban, right? nearly rural people treat it. People treat VT like Wyoming-levels rural, even vaguely close that. No, stay defeated pls. study seems indicate (see tables) household transmission MUCH likely non-household. Possibly, guard down—no distancing, shields, long exposure unmasked? Signs stable genius. 


Imagine rooting imbecile like ignoring question misdirecting.

Lots trolls slamming NY without ever offering counterexamples states recovering better, why.  would anyone ever vote knowing sacrificing many lives increase chances elected again? proven countless times give flying fuk American citizens anything stay office. think trends really huge right now.

It'll even eventually 1) look trend 2 points, 2) understand might late trend. sloppiness means gotta look bigger picture, maybe dig outliers bit more, wait bit longer understand what's going on.

When looking 2 week trend, probably can't really tell split evenly. week might shorter last week that's looks like less deaths. wait next week see continues. 

If edification, fine. bit harder draw conclusions signal big noise. Trump’s base utterly, almost submissively, loyal him. next SOTU address could involve killing Barron drinking blood they’d still vote him. one said need take transportation. Goes show spoiled are. True, although believe higher 44% people wearing masks. Hong Kong study tested hamsters found transmission dropped 75% infected non-infected wore medical masks (it closer 44% one side them). think caution since talking hamsters controlled environment, logically increase protection especially large droplets.

If unmitigated disease R_0 3, 75% reduction spread would mean effective R_0 0.75. Anything R_0 1.0 end pandemic. get medical masks everyone addition social distancing, pandemic could controlled pretty quickly. What's best setting HRV people quarantining household? want prevent spread virus.

my HRV following modes:

\- vent (always ventilating)

\- circulation

\- off

I currently set vent thinking best exchange fresh air time.  Sigh. think known trump's revenge. virus clearly racist. Probably voted Trump. Governor think enemy. Check story: Teacher dies coronavirus warning parents violating isolation sending kids school Flipboard

Edit: forgot add ""from Israel"" Yup, I’m extremely concerned Trump able coronavirus isn’t eliminated November.  Duhhhhhhhhh. &lt;—— previous statement intelligent Oklahoma’s governor Republicans. get trial?! want guinea pig bad!! I'm full blown liberal socialist, know country? genuinely want decide id rather there. sounds like fun question. Look. sounds like satisfied mediocrity response think could done better. don’t doubt could lot worse too. 

And no. didn’t sign this. that’s ideology, good you, that’s unreasonable assume applies everyone. somehow think hospitals prepared 100 year event irrational, yet every individual healthcare worker go field ready this. irrational. 

The shortage PPE mismanagement. could done better. hospital management isn’t capable setting buffer PPE rotation prevent excess expirations, certainly aren’t capable managing peoples lives. 

You would know you’ve worked healthcare, bloated messed system is. Bullshit administrative jobs provide true productivity care. Contracts go lowest bidder. Corners cut wherever cut. systems suck ass lock frequently. Hospitals hire low quality workers means pay little less. every department providing actual care understaffed. Meanwhile executives plenty time take peoples temperatures doors, hand food, scratch balls hallways. 

The decisions hospitals make, ever, less providing best patient care bottom line. come family HCWs. lot HCWs see it. guess either see don’t. 

BTW far lobbying. attest first hand information one largest providers west coast lobbying state hard. Especially first round IMO premature cancelling electives. want business usual costs. Know one reasons SC, NC, FL bad now? Know New Yorkers went breakout? still say haven’t needed reefer trailers haul dead bodies. Cases deaths.  Fauci supports m4a. isnt like average person, seeing things ground himself. sees videos social media posts etc. Texas, would say compared folks seen areas, far young people wearing masks reckless &amp; thing is, related politics. friend (hes 26) posted video hookah bar galveston girlfriend although looked like decreased capacity, still indoors w/others nobody masks. guy actually supported Bernie DJ raver, tons really cool masks. makes sense😥 young people also post social media more&amp; therefore going visible. Regardless wish people would put spread false idea masks 100% protective Covid? So... Trump hopes COVID disappear pretending exist? help they've completely ignored warnings advice people actually might care.  Pro life Maga cult worry freedom restricted due masks Yes, ablation procedure. I'm sorry hear they're trouble locating it. hope find you. distant relatives Tachycardia, able use information guess mine would tried mapping it. seen numbers LA city? Every official number ever seen goes LA County.

First hit Google? Second? Fiftieth? use LA County, better use entire NYC Metro Area. Cherry picking biggest possible number one city smallest possible transparently Using logic, honest mention population density.

When virus spread close contact, honest, damn important. Spread directly related people packed together indoors.

And, again, sure know this. respond further. right everyone looking like crazy? used contact tracing. find cases large low positivity population- *then* start contact tracing.

For example- sewage testing identifies breakout area. find people? He's semi-evil... quasi evil... Diet Coke evil -- one calorie, evil enough. Agree here. haven’t left house really since March 16th son’s life important monetary scoring program call economy (because, man made, managed man).. 

Idiots running country. People fishing mosquito nets, knowing contain chemicals keep mosquitoes away (probably deet something along lines). ate fish, contaminated chemical people got sick way.

It's surprising people argue bad faith intentional really people using something intended used for. User error. Gates probably thought days behind him.  “Only helps minimize Spread”

That LITERALLY entire point wearing masks. wording like it’s negative took sawzall wall around second story window place. Put wider window in. great. put old window road chunk wall it. gone quickly. Sigh, 1 100 cases distributed evenly population. really, really basic statistics.  zero medical epidemiological reason ramp testing face we’re seeing now. national embarrassment — display malicious incompetence. don’t think rapid tests antigen tests widely available back March though. Clear especially bad anti-maskers wearing translucent mesh masks protest, fuckwits. 99.97 recover, gets well moves on. end. lose money selling shares tripled value since start 2020. 

They made millions left vault. That’s backfiring. O’Hare last week case. know point worth making change subject try make it.

You know point worth making? Think Hong Kong still way imagine happened internet. We're incredibly fortunate tool instantly share critical info every scientist world. Injecting lysol seems extreme. 

Have tried getting UV light body? Maybe go outside scream sun, way uv light gets body mouth, droplets scream sanitized too.

Just like that, virus magically disappear. 100% guaranteed work.* kind comes across elitist. families budget never get Midwest, Florida may well great destination.

I'd guess vaccine becomes widely distributed would month masks social distance still norm (there delay caused long take majority people get vaccinated, delay long takes vaccine actually take effect, etc). I'm afraid soon vaccine gets announced people let guard soon reality take time vaccine's effects seen. Probably, least awhile. people can’t get vaccine others won’t. vaccine also doesn’t guarantee won’t get it. believe measles outbreaks, infected included people vaccinated. see tried crying sprinkling choice words me? cute. problem group people reading much news - need calm down.

And group people reading enough news - need informed.

It's finding side on... risk obviously low

It’s things appear I’d say citizen believe there's realness effectiveness masks, numbers may sway +/- fashion based types masks, worn, etc etc.

We still long ways go fully understand anything 7-8 month old virus. believe agree tragedy nonetheless hopefully eventually get board idea masks help save people. Indeed. No, need extrapolate bit further. God perfect source goodness. God gave coronavirus, perfectly right so, thus must perfectly good reason suffer.

[CDC looking vaccine trials Help stop virus. else people supposed work? People cramped going broke soo long. Researchers traced children felt sick. transmission rates asymptomatic cases remains unknown, children less likely adults develop symptoms

Yes, people high viral load point symptomatic safe viral shedding transmit like anyone else. question is: often children schools get point rather remaining asymptomatic relatively low viral load low viral shedding? mention safest kids ever been, last school shooting? februrary? cause know NONE march first time 10 years 


1 feb, 1 jan, 0 march, 0 april, 0 may, 0 june (edit) Hoping Mexico gets speedy well 🙏 Honestly situation solution it. need 1 infected person restart whole mess again. country region think situation control dragged mess soon normal life resumed. try flatten curve much possible also get economy going atleast bare minimum. situation drag drag drag vaccine herd immunity takes place think they've actually started ramping production significantly (with help $750 million donation Gates last month)-- target 400 million total vaccines end 2020 (much distributed within US). Oct - Nov still viable timeline people start getting vaccinated, long nothing goes wrong Phase III think we're great position.  they're not. They're way proactive Florida. average days Florida least 2x bad terms case count, positivity rate deaths. 

LA shut soon things get better. next Florida lol add that. Oxford name carries **lot** weight. loss credibility would quite lot take in. 

This probably Man's Sky vaccines. said canceling 4th drive people bigger reckless parties argument USA afford offer follow care covid cases many European countries without anyone else losing out. 

It's matter political economics.  “I’m okay activity, want reasonable measures taken.”

Ok, cut capacity small fraction, closed indoor areas, enforced strict social distancing remaining areas, put partitions dining areas, enforce mandatory mask usage. good enough?


“No, would even think that’s ok?”

While argument, 70% spread happening people’s homes

I get downvoted saying theme parks reopen limit outdoor areas, cut capacity mandate masks. I’ve downvoted saying encouraging people use national parks. downvoted saying beaches parks great resources give people activity without introducing much risk, mistake close early on. I’ve downvoted saying pro sports severe restrictions probably problem.

Where exactly reasonably restricted activities going take place? Keep shutting everything mystified people host social gatherings home spread virus. speak countries afford defend (developed nations) made mistakes continue make mistakes.

I long made argument need effect test, trace isolate (including surveillance catch outbreaks quickly emerge). need need future too, whenever next pandemic is.

Majority developed countries learning. know mobilize infrastructure effectively enforce necessary rules either (too much focus individual freedoms, even wellbeing all).

Ironically, corporations shown leadership governments. Yeah, I’m Walmart fan, either. people wearing masks, you’re less likely get coronavirus cleaner store people don’t wear masks.

After over, remember stores restaurants pandered anti-maskers otherwise didn’t take Covid seriously. influence future consumer choices, even it’s safe go back anti-mask places. doesn’t matter it’s mild one person. person mild case NEEDS know protect people.

It may sniffles tommy-boy, could goodnight grandma. understand. hear common sense dictates face coverings work? really need study this? answer recommending something simple easy effective. what? want us give wait vaccine end half population infected? Hospitals already capacity states fool. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* completely neglect US another imperialist countries done countries exploiting last several hundred years.

Capitalism works first world rape pillage “third world”. can't travel go bars, there's nothing spend money might well save think would depend timeframe reinfection. Scientists confident neutralizing antibodies protective, question long last whether forms immunity still protective even fade. If, say, immunity lasts minimum 4-6 months people, fades within year, reason believe haven’t seen reinfections yet.

The first people confirmed virus China January. Since China population 1.4 billion, around 80,000 infections, little current circulation virus, odds wouldn’t see reinfection cases. next countries see widespread transmission European countries since also brought pandemic mostly control. US next course still seeing large circulation virus. Still, immunity lasts least 4 months March 19th fewer 14,000 confirmed infections. takes least 4 months immunity wear it’s unlikely would see many reinfection cases, especially since parts country transmission concentrated changed.

However, it’s also entirely possible reports outliers people develop long-term immunity. Chickenpox example virus people never get once, people do. Note still able get herd immunity via chickenpox vaccine.

Edit: March 19th (4 months ago) Thanks clarifying position. never understood children could biologically different rest population. Republican mayor's governor's also killing Americans. trump, 70% Republican approval rating.

Calling republican means support massive death count. Ever seen documentary ""winter fire?"" protested winter president resigned bailed helicopter. Many people shot police it... (good movie get chance watch it). Fair point. also could’ve gone find (I remember reading it) I’m also lazy :) bothering? aunt idiot

Show photos red hat meat wagons sent Texas ask recalls bad flu season fucking amazing news considering awful four months ago Got it. It’s definitely 100% Democrats take precautions 100% Republicans don’t, instance proves sure. curious find previous trump voters affected virus change mind (given he’s one downplaying Biden not).  Fuck Thanks input - make sense. 

I think switch way, plan also start looking rolling 7 day average.  

We improve! supposed happen? course reopening cause cases. There's argument made covid patients better immune response keep covid limited terms internal impact.

So theory person good immune response, maybe producing fewer viral particles replicated.

A GOOD part science confirming falsifying hypothesis. 
Sometimes WEIRD things happen either way.

For example, could 100% certain X true circumstances. something crazy like test space underwater find things totally different. hope so, I’d like know. :) cdc stated masks work? blocked uk. anyone summarise?  Brazil winter right now..it’s different hemisphere. True! that’s kinda bummer miracle...
I think we’re angling ‘bigly’ one gets giant ratings TV. Maybe something involving Jesus alien intervention something cool. get ill separate family completely stay isolated.

I'm sure complicated Yeah, lot wrong neoliberal ideology. said, want semi competent human spew vitriol Twitter every day. remember politics boring, want return that. want civility return extent. know happen night, step one getting rid asshole now. Norway open Sweden well month now. Gatherings 200 people allowed since June 15 example, compared 50 Sweden. They've averaged around 11 new confirmed cases per day last month.

There's method keep infections long relatively infected: [contact isolation. states also past clear distinct 1st peak hit 1st worse treatment options available severely I'll. currently 4 times less likely die March.

The rest country still approaching 1st peak.

We're literally sitting watching many states literally learned nothing. already know long, painful trailing end peak occurs, several states still rushing even bigger peak NYC, absolute lunacy.

Most areas, btw, also lowest levels transmission currently. Israel mess thx Sherlock working masses know screwed over, sorry condescending can’t see that. That’s capitalism die out. Well boomers global warming, youths coronavirus. Fair play guess. hotspots states listed still cities. realize Florida/Texas rural, right? Miami epicenter huge city. Texas, it’s Houston. 

I’m saying you’re wrong think see deaths go again, don’t know we’ll go 1000/day again. hope ceiling even lower that, we’ll see. also vetoed $15/hour minimum wage. may handling pandemic adequately, I'm voting him. works consolidated districts. I’m Illinois and, outside cities, crazy patchwork overlapping high school elementary districts. daughter goes school kids attend different high school district will, high school attend fed least four elementary districts. That's awesome! Keep force change! feel comfortable getting operation warpspeed trump vaccine? alright buddy interacted number patients known covid tested postive. nurse forgot tell us didnt tell us time.  

masks reduce risk. maybe health care worker asymptomatic. spread staff patents. 

I saved daily masks sanitized reason. 80 day supply.

btw talking n95 surgical mask?

I talking surgical mention pre-existing conditions Correct. Something like 85% kids asymptomatic (or maybe that's elementary aged kids?) little can’t accomplish economic strings full wearing mask public also endangers people around Fuck that’s actually good point. It’s almost like people don’t want stay inside watch Netflix rest lives virus statistically likely kill them. wanna know oxford pushed phase 1? based mers vaccine already went phase 1, already know safe, need prove is, works? Quote:

'A team Oxford say identified vaccine candidate working towards first clinical trials.

The Oxford team’s vaccine contains genetic sequence “spike” protein found outside coronavirus.

After vaccination, the surface spike protein coronavirus produced, primes immune system attack coronavirus later infects body.

According team, chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1), developed Oxford’s Jenner Institute, chosen suitable vaccine technology SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

This generate strong immune response one dose replicating virus, cannot cause ongoing infection vaccinated individual.

This also makes safer give children, elderly anyone pre-existing condition diabetes.

Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors well-studied vaccine type, used safely thousands subjects vaccines targeting 10 different diseases.' mean duh? Thanks putting report perspective! I’m Mexico right (from CA). It’s really hit miss terms masks social distancing. Went restaurant last night astonished see packed distancing, servers wearing masks none bartenders were. went restaurant next door spaced closer 10 plus feet everyone including owner wearing mask full time. betting Mexico spreading covid widely. called plutocracy, regulation directed funnel economic wealth select lower middle classes longer needed sustain economy nation need protect them. That’s literally American health system tho. Shes actually Democrat. thought things blown proportion. hates trump, didnt think anything would happen shes healthy. face shield alone slightly protects coughing/sneezing/spitting people vice versa. Well, yeah. able to? don’t know things like aren’t bigger headlines something tf? interesting people actually getting vaccine effective marketing. August 26th? Luck you, go back 5th Honestly wash hands put groceries away. Unless plan licking packaging don’t think it’s risky 😋 Yeah, true me. get enough people join social media vote en mass...Maybe he'll pout quit. above. Every little bit helps, others, right need things help everyone. 0.1% chance catching flu go hospital that's huge deal personally, across entire population dropping would make huge impact hospital usage. Although understandable, simply excuse reckless behaviour.

The way beat epidemic whole country comes together one.

**If apathy made give ending now, better boomers started first place.** Ah, projection. finding vaccine resulting TCells well would huge producing antibodies TCells people spit people's faces occasionally, still strictly better nothing. also prevents spitting people's faces. Oh no.... Astoria gotta go current Democrat front runner sound leftist  US much worse, scale population. 100 Hong Kong (7.5 million people) equivalent US 4,400 cases day. US 15 times worse. fairly sure proportion entitled Chinese anti-maskers far fewer number US.  studies Science Daily commentary study, Klara M.

This appears study referred actually addresses question whether Covid-19 spreads schools.

__

Regarding medrxiv link, review studies undertaken Zhu et al., authors also possible children simply fewer interactions outside home adults therefore less likely index cases. may magnified countries implemented school closures attempt control outbreak. However, worth noting Singapore mandate closure schools yet still detect household clusters transmission SARS-CoV-2 children index case. Yes, researcher area National Guard started free testing program McDonalds coupons! researchers need data small time frame (“snapshot”) r/noshitsherlock pandemic silver lining, it’s seeing fucking amazing scientists are. “our” American, mean them. incredible. 

It’s also extremely sad see many people anti-science though risk?

I think overboard Certain polyester blends breathable sweating big issue. course assuming humidity 100%  100 cases whole country adequate contact tracing point full understanding things spread, one would concerned reopening schools.

We worried increase already happening far positivity rate, worried cases posivity rate putting people contact situation government admits masks, vaccines social distancing work. fuckin' thing even beat SUN! reason never made SARS vaccine ""worked"" SARS died fast effectiveness trials finish. Weak attempt put burden proof opponent cry called troll. Also started insult calling officers daughter. catch, familiar wirh Russian political scene memes. Try better next time, Mr. ""this country"" Well good them. Lemme see Italian cookies them. 

Nope. Actually false equivalence factor infrastructure resources US bring table versus individual nations EU. Italy Spain even EUs backing shit 3 trillion dollars accomplished nothing. step 3: go r/aww  they’re top beaches doesn’t matter... knowledge supply dexamethasone jeopardy, could easily change given cases keep increasing know supply chain equipped handle it. course typically 5 days, patient that's going started need 5 day supply could ramifications road. definitely would recommend average person go try get rx dexamethasone we're using patients hypoxic. There's fear starting patients hypoxic could actually increase viral shedding worsen symptoms. 

Early March/April using hydroxychloroquine azithromycin, that's longer case, evidence points using it. regards famotidine, commonly used ICU stress ulcer prophylaxis patient intubated, seen anything indicating used actual treatment COVID. 

There's much still learn virus. realize we're 6 months pandemic. scares even July hospital capacity...we're rough time flu season hits. high deaths go spike US when?

I’m thinking 1300/day 7 days eyeballing graphs expertise reddit Well won’t disagree all. Thanks understanding. What? Maybe misread they're viruses, bands. still double book problem! Virginia. either need doctors note/symptoms get free test pay pharmacy administer test curious worried exposure Plus assume Asian children well behaved clean due culture, could wrong idk young things get instilled GOP start calling Biden virus immediately. Okay recheck

Thx!  know whether laugh cry. LOL FUCK ever question? close normal 2020 ends cheer bro honestly wonder liability factor this. Lawsuits bound occur teachers students/parents. compelled attendance, would imagine due care would necessary, especially anything involving children. suppose indemnity could used, that’s play, rough time. know makes **REALLY** hard breathe?


COVID19 Eh, I'm seeing lot people 40s 50s told put mask also. 

Yes, young people still partying stuff, middle age people still act like fighting rights hope none colleagues financial duress returning 100% sure they're fine, hope they're smart taking precautions. imagine 'professional world' big reputations travel easily they're aware major mishaps repercussions line, even different employers. 

Personally would definitely eat anything else masks worn seclusion first fortnight, extremely unlucky someone carrying tests negatively longer that. 

I'm kind boat (pun intended), left China holiday mid January since I've stranded Thailand Malaysia. leave apartment stuff place China, colleagues friends different countries, family another continent. I've able work home little really waiting I'm free go back normal life. know hard find virgin days? pay satanist anymore.  agree  God, can't wait move next October. husband always talk points... Literally seems like state shit together sometimes. ""not allowed"". Vermont pandemic lot better places. dude, wut. Like /u/supertitin , see like 99.5% compliance, least metro, includes within station (regular user 14 5 Paris).

I agree controls, it'll hard. transport worker London died control dude spit face. Apparently RATP got hit hard previous epidemic/pandemic, they're probably bit shy controls, also, though see one St Lazare couple days ago.

Use shops pretty common, I'll give 30-40% streets. quoting would like know people feel tbh. MRNA vaccine theoretically much better antigen vaccine like attenuated virus stimulates TH1 pathway eliminates virus infected cells killer cells. Antigen vaccines poor history, DPT vaccine increasing childhood mortality vs control group consisting kid's sick vaccinated Africa. MMR attenuated virus vaccine hand halves cause mortality. course still unproven, initial results highly encouraging. think older vulnerable people still shielding.

As say, younger infected means fewer deaths. stat abused say ""the virus becoming less lethal strain"" used try get shielding people back work. Fenofibrate actually work cholesterol, though. works triglycerides. type fat. fat accumulation triglyceride, work. likely Trilipix, fenofibric acid, would work.  major triglyceride lowering drug gemfibrozil. 40,000 people die everyday anyways 😒 /s need move. Great job. Sounds like people told Also difficult orgasm condom, yet I'd still wear prevent spread DNA. Community Spread means can't trace back source infection. 

When ICMR reported community spread, back June 12, one third cases villages get virus. 

They never lied. reported. Ho god I'm fucking him. He's dirty ugly stupid. putting dick that.... Thing

But would like beat crap True point? Still sucks though. states mess. Sarcasm hope! Sorry kids dad toss away life cult leader.  finally know someone gets covid, they're like ok, still hoax, maybe better mask up. 😒 Actually.. nobody wearing mask everyone using legal exception: ""I'm 1m away anyone""


A week ago regional government made mandatory matter distance..

1 week hit home hits you, family loved ones. like difference major minor surgery, major me, minor you. average positivity rate US according Johns Hopkins 6.44 percent, course heavily skewed outliers, outliers predominantly urban areas, counties US would far 5 percent.    *claps* bravo time, desperate trump reckless senseless acts. things life worse death. 
Ask anyone faces permanent disease serious disability. 

If face life confined darkened room, unable things enjoy life, I'd end myself. hoax now, hoax then. Let's focus brown people trying come country ""illegally"", nothing see here... sewage gets better testing do. Yeah? think everyone's looking Utah, shitshow south. help thinking ""The force strong one""... That’s comes to. don’t believe it’s knocking door, point it’s late. brother ended actually contracting virus too, luckily us able get thru it. Others fortunate. Friends mine devastated family members dropping. buddy mine lost 5 aunts uncles. Tragic shit, man. Luckily it’s lot better definitely spread due protests, studies contact tracers confirmed it. fraction population actually showed person protests? people supported home.

Compare relaxed attitude general public, many people parties (birthday, graduation, reunion quarantine) businesses open. people think reopening businesses sign things returning normal. observing social circles talking close ones.

Those studies show protests contribute, much spread reopenings, increased personal gatherings, lowering caution. like admonishing smaller group bigger factors involved. changed rapidly got lot better, imagine that's much feels sensible person US hotspot area right now.

What's I've hearing UK low mask compliance though?

If wearing masks, what's keeping guys self-destructing like us US?  agreed it’s horrible system! Years ago victim I’ll never forget felt. can’t take leave absence? Family Medical Leave Act, disability, anything? Would also cause lose insurance? rough situation. best baby! You’re guaranteed right attorney you’re accused serious crime *and* prove you’re impoverished. perfectly reasonable disagreement can’t addressed til pays attorney $400/hr. 

It wish /s, it’s not. would reply would certainly oppose someone managed create *worldwide* conspiracy. Like get Balkans agree this? get Israel Palestine agree fake this? would surely oppose master mind. Yes normally breathing nose exhaling what's point? Unless he's/she's mouth breather damn time, highly doubt.  Lmao already saw notification typed comment username deleted it. Switching accounts try win argument lamest thing do. Stop wasting time since can't stay one name discuss issue like adult. worse thing happens end talking kid find there's nothing going on.

The worst thing happens go literally years bullying. right stupid ass American. Probably stupid enough wear mask, probably anti-vax, maybe even stupid enough covid parties. can't combat ignorance different ignorance man get that, inappropriate many may feel is. complete shit show here, almost write kind stuff that's happening.

The comment comes across complete different way though, asked. There’s like 30 people whole state Yeah shit happens don’t seem empathy it. They'll know someone know gets hospitalized dies come virus. Lies.. hilarious Seems way administration flat wants people dead, allowed go on? sad scene likely repeated many times around world still understand cloth mask directional. stops droplets one way... stop opposite way. know 100%, whatever percentage one way, help other... Jesus, it’s call ahead thing dummy. joke? number 1 state COVID deaths due incompetent leadership. 再说中国一县城市里人口都很密集，不可能只有八万。我爸当年在新华社工作的时候，就隐瞒过好几次数据，明明是十万就写一万。总之，我觉得中央的数据不怎么可靠。 going remove guy started clearly trying antagonize me? defend said people walking around masks earlier? worked supporters dropping like flies November, rest sick get vote (and can’t go back mail know supporters can’t read don’t know buy postage stamps). 

All round sucks them.  COVID hurting people needs hurting - ""gop""^/s already hate living Arizona. Covid made much worse. daily reminders stupid people here. NYTimes article: ""The study worrisome children middle high school. group even likely infect others adults were, study found. experts said finding may fluke may stem children’s behaviors.

These older children frequently big adults, yet may unhygienic habits young children do. may also likely younger children socialize peers within high-rise complexes South Korea.

“We speculate day this, don’t know,” Dr. Osterholm said. “The bottom line message is: There’s going transmission.” upstate NY sadly... ever was. confirm, live county canal see manatees kitchen window  google I’ll bite - why? supposed cough cash die /s  regret wearing mask?

“I don’t really second guess anything”

Who voted people??? really mandating masks seems like dereliction duty incredibly stupid. Mandating masks simple...even enforced fines etc help flatten curve. 

BTW shocked first governer got it. shocked get it. Honestly, I'd like see happen, funny feeling everything's going stay open anyway. Spoiler alert even NY didnt learn NY. drive hours upstate. Demand strip supply finally get paid deserve. sounds bit high. know average age someone dying C-19 80 US. According actuary tables, average 80 YO 8.28 years left live. know sure isn’t killing average 80 year old likely kill someone sicker, might shave roughly 4 years life average victim, absolutely 8.28 years. .5 percent get killed it, likely shave quite bit less 3 years collective life expectancy. Welcome GOP way solving problems, test report it, exist. virus? least die. that's big win book. Thanks. quick search must read wrong. Recovered means symptoms think. I'm doctor would like sure say true I’m getting downvoted facts, surprise sub

Newsflash: think facts, facts. Go learn. rough year pneumonia...just bad luck pneumonia outbreak coincided silly little covid outbreak, eh? we've learned last year, plenty people pay kids' way good schools. quoted bolded part, repeated pro tempore Senate** Speaker House Representatives DeSantis: Ignorance arrogance true enemy. responsible deaths. Use freedom rights vote guy stop pushing blame foreign countries.
Blm good freedom white house stupidly better Maybe take every single person literally. seriously sound like trying muddy waters works doesn't. Also, read every comment every branch thread I'm dicking around internet. I'll reiterate said before. average mask helps prevent droplet transmission people wearing masks. help prevent aerosolized transmission virus. I'm directly immersed shit every single day. care anymore, good day. Even Burlington, largest ""city"" would like town New York. People wearing masks social distancing, major factor density people given area low. Glad didnt ""waste time"" say raised possibility. Stress cause what? Blood clots? symptoms? time? Dispite mountain medical evidence suggesting Covid attacks every organ causes major clotting body? Alter blood palate count? Destroy white blood cells? Cause major autoimmune responses? 

Dispite Dr. Fauci, one top doctors world agreeing thought long haulers facing M.E.? Dispite 4 specialists personally telling otherwise?

No right, bud. Fuck medical degree. 
Reddit university, way. Lol. actually aren't. I've seen plenty flaunting public. Well one without shaking system get away archaic first-past-the-post Partisanship voters significant tribalism.

Break up, vote policies parties. understand people would continue gather large groups. boggles mind.  That's going popular reddit unless blame entire Republican party pin Trump. shocked, _shocked!_ vary community. area plenty college educated folks refuse mask up, locals tourists! lot folks also wealthy. think thing that's helping city totally blown covid we're interstate highway. media's goal reason tell people week thing that's it, rather discuss evidence contrary Actually, Bernie candidate primaries 2016...I thought best choice election, could went 3rd party broke partisanship that’s plagued us since independence England. Well, keep parroting line young people can't get seriously ill, obviously care. misinformation needs stop repeated everyone.  (facepalm) hospitals send data White House, one know bad try go one. true point changing data.

To hide cook books.

Corruption deception ideals. u/Governor_DeSantis say yourself?  say applied directly you, common trope hear people caring governments corporations running wild right privacy. might affect specifically, could line. Yes people smarter share data, also accountability.

Also Snowden leaks clearly refute claims need warrants, etc (rubber stamped FISA warrants count).

Also look police using things like Stingrays capture protestors haul black sites without due process. 

So yes, complaining pizzagate public Facebook page stupid think they're you, mean care privacy. they're gonna microchip us, already carry stuff anyways need to.

I'm equally worried Google government power  Score: Karen 1, Educators: 0 38% Americans approve POTUS's handling pandemic. simply cannot comprehend this.

The data situation reminds piece would read developing country can't find way poverty. Ok, stands right New York country would 3x deaths per million next 3 countries. would tied jersey amount deaths, currently (not saying time call game yet) 10x deaths per million states. say everything right ignore data. New York worst response globally seen.

This say basics needed response also one (again far) warrant federal medical ships mass graves. 

Now looking forward states dealing with, seems be, different potancy virus. Cases per day spiking yet death tolls dropping. Yes know there's unknown long term risks, I'm saying roses, suggest worst hit state things properly joke, imagine telling Italy better say Australia response, looks like. Indeed. want they're acting like is. consider adaptability strength. It’s difficult say means vaccine.

For example, it’s caused rare genetic issue, may mean much society. reinfection happens due antibodies disappearing, may mean need multiple vaccine shots year. scenario isn’t bad, except would nightmare drug manufacturing.

The nightmare scenario combination antibodies going away quickly strains virus.

One reasons flu vaccine given year isn’t effective vaccine isn’t well suited strain spreading year. example, 2018-2019, flu vaccine effective 29% cases. 

In nightmare scenario, would people get vaccinated, run around care-free, depending effectiveness year, may end sick spreading virus. 

Of course, strains isn’t necessarily bad. strains could mean virus gets weaker adapts deadly. 

For now, done take note adamant wearing mask even get COVID think you’re immune.

Flu vaccines vaccine effectiveness see crazy dip daily numbers hospitals forced send data Trump's cronies CDC Curious - what's argument caring average American? ie. working class/not rich people. like trapped dark ravenous monster. whim would king. Great hear. Hate governor I'm guessing he'll definitely re-elected year maybe employers want pay That's cause know bosses lying. I've companies say that, minute try call sick, head office starts calling say irresponsible are.  turned stove stuck hand got burned. Democrats tried failed sabotage me. remaining hand, will.... got $1,200 STIMULUS check. supposed tho spend help STIMULATE economy. Order take tip well. Upgrade computer TV. Shop support local businesses, etc. Donating say good option too, many non profits taken financial hit, too, lack donations people unemployed such. meant welfare check goes financially struggling. would stimulate economy broadly spending would limited basic necessities, utilities, food, Bill payments, etc. Yeah, someone may enforce law, big question since clear case government actors telling break law, would entrapment automod remove comments mention c-word? Sound like got hit hard. virus effects everyone differently. squat to, others brain dead ya dead. Dramatically undercounted death numbers probably thinking  USA fucking banana republic moment. Oh well. It’s sacrifice made get fucking haircut. Fuck them. fuck anyone supports them. think,,well yes..we warned. However stories reports like good thing public health managing epidemic. people empathize place life empathy may cause follow masking social distancing.

Oh gosh..I baby..my life lot like hers. want happen family; better vigilant masking cleaning.

Those sorts thoughts

is might finally sway person take seriously Rage inducing. like US to, I'd imagine China's numbers fake tons people (myself included) believed spring, got antibody test, found not. know March there's way know (because antibodies could either virus), think counted re-infection. Uh no, meeting past week. also know daughter 2nd specifically stated administration “masks required.” words, mine. So, please don’t accuse dishonest reason be. “Everyone got infected”? Estimates NY around overal infection 14%, whereas generally agreed upon percentage herd immunity 5 times 70%.  
Since like percentages means NY would 500% increase people got virus statement accurate. even accounting possibility antibodies effective couple months. Trump's Tulsa rally. get there? knows, maybe got someone else got there. 

Do know else got corona virus Trump's Tulsa rally? Herman Cain.

I wish everybody mild/no symptoms speedy recovery, let's please try act less stupid future.   child told touch hot stove, touches burned, one might say deserved it. 

However, child instead knocks boiling pot water themselves, resulting pain 25% body disfiguring scars last decades, people common decency would show sympathy.

Yes, elected many totally inept people, including Trump. didn’t deserve this. supposed do? Bail everyone? Even there's many places plan place stop spread may plan citizens following guidelines keep everyone safe? would vain. Small businesses need follow rules too. public health important shop.

Oh yeah, thanks going topic making thread now. want pay taxes either, yet hit beer truck tested positive? literally 

That tells need know. surprise. gf planning it. Good thing fox viewers reading. Fuck them. come part state recreation infect us. wear masks here.  County level tyre storage facility fire then?  course ideals. There's least 5 major ones: **Greed, cruelty, selfishness, corruption, deception.** ideals. ones treasure. sacrifice number lives important things living. hospitals yet full. Science stand way. take responsibility all.

That's baffling complete utter madness let disease slowly run population hope ""herd immunity"". 

To aim herd immunity directly without even knowing long immunity lasts kind long term effects disease infected people disgrace developed country. us 1.5% 4.9 million people.

I gotta something though. short layers done January they've grown point hair limp flat they're long jagged mop ends, layers.  keep safe. Every state said isn’t big deal see huge surge deaths. Lancet published this: /r/Coronavirus/comments/hltqck/exaggerated_risk_of_transmission_of_covid19_by/ "" opinion, chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough sneeze (within 1–2 h). disagree erring side caution, go extremes justified data.

Now, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab.

The flip side surface transmisson rare would nearly transmissions directly person person. indoor mask policy education, possibly combination spacial arrangement airflow studies, would almost certainly much curb spread disinfecting. would still disinfect meat purchases, though, due fact meat packing plants continue suffer outbreaks virus stable weeks refrigerator temperatures. keep breaking age groups? Humans affected. humans. Yes. story example worst kind covid propaganda, IMO. ostensibly credible news sources like azcentral.com push idea outbreak moderating, reasonable people read believe it. lot decent people read story think safe send kids back school.

Generally, lations take kind shit serious. rare see mexican without mask on.

Saw bunch white people Pismo day without mask though. asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

Worse idiot, someone actively avoids trying learn anything. past week cases gone way up. usually takes least couple weeks virus overwhelms you.  Yes, different thing, ignoring this:


“In conclusion, (the) closure schools measurable direct impact number laboratory confirmed cases school-aged children Finland Sweden,” agencies said report, published last week. Worldometers gives active cases country state world general. checked states gives active cases county gives total top, realized top total total added counties active cases correlate all. like this? number likely accurate? really wonder much difficulty wearing masks strenuous activity comes fact trap heat. definitely felt like wearing mask (doing socially distant hiking friend) also overheating like crazy felt like significant factor (not that’s necessarily easier fix low oxygen would be).  That's ok... doubt new TeleTracking Technologies data collector back. win BID contract, follow orders Boss. would never gotten think message clear start people would complied. Heh. Ignorant people part every population every country. usa wearing seatbelt law rather suggestion. driving drunk crime. 

Why warnings many products.

So yeah..it hard deal anti maskers. anti vaxxers, want see police COMPLETELY shut down, partially defunded reformed. 

So comes personal public safety, suppose always segment ignorant plain..not bright, Michigan better whatever. kinda crazy quiet chicago whole thing. general midwest really. heard big numbers come there. would've thought least bigger cities would reported bigger outbreaks, mask believers not. Fronto-temporal dementia seemed like would karma hubris Dunning-Kruger, stopped adulation, yet. “toolbox”? hate meaningless buzzwords. Regardless broward people old they’re day drinkers totally useless. It’s really, really fucking stupid. It’s appeasement, accomplish nothing except people want things remain open greed wicked way killing people meager profits. think lovely example people ignore facts promote beliefs. Next Goya making test kits.  Unless dengue, antibodies fade disease hits  already listed several big ones. Wearing mask doesn’t protect COVID, prevents infected potentially spreading it. 

Stop political want anyone, R, believe factual information. Anti-science Trump voters, God help us. That's psychological reason people buy conspiracy theories. makes feel important superior everyone else ""doesn't know"" It’s hard believe even joke admin incompetent  COVID iceberg. know that...........in USA, bullcrap pretty compelling argument.

The positive thing want transport : matter control spread is, take right measures bring down. virus works magic survive transiently humans (people elimate virus die). Hence starve virus hosts NPI bring levels numbers manage TTI regional measures. 2k/day last days ago. caught initial wave peaked around 10k/day. sure also manage smaller wave, Spanish govt burnt child. “You tests get cases” solution slow stop testing say “look see numbers going way down.

God help kids used political pawns. Well i’m “highly educated” horrible executive function adhd sure lay suburbs? Forgettaboutid.

I live Hinsdale spend shit ton time Naperville. seen masks worn nearly everyone indoors. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Highly doubt it, might see mask mandates limited hours stores. Haha, yeah I'm pretty anxious all. know chances actually dying fairly low, I'm concerned potential long term health issues. think anxiety worse government pushing reopen schools. 3 young kids really seems like horrible idea schools open. Even though kids stay home online school, still makes mad lot parents option. 

I've lived almost 10 years now, husband American I'm England. think moving sometimes, I'm sure would go. Things England great either, I've never really desire move back there. actually like living time, summer heat joke though! even responding Really either one works here. US exactly succeeding. people thread hear want hear. It’s partisan stuff losers cant think themselves. They’re actually offended said Vermont, place live, rural. think pathetic death rate 10,9% Spain vs 3,73 US. like call mild point outbreak either. Casino owner here, 0% agree. make sacrifices save lives businesses. CoRona Deathsentence already canadian. difference...our syrup better. Sorry, canada. I'm Mayenne, complaining weeks people idiots. masks, people huddled terrasse drinking beer smoking cigarettes. 

Now we've made national news, pariah scapegoat second wave! 

9/10 people wearing masks public places. 10/10 made mandatory Friday Mayenne, try telling peasant-minded people walk supermarket mask touch things, sneeze, talk, cough... potentially killing people... care.

I hope France changes, people less self-centered start caring friends neighbours more... miss countries... Leading question buddy. reply I'm interested husband course Russians vaccine then. hacking American research! Police, sanitation workers, journalists etc time longer it. Absolutely wrong. far worse. Im Vermont family knows personally since used race local circuit. nice guy person, genuinely cares. probably reuse filters multiple times. P100, bigger filters, non-dusty air filters good years.   Good thing repeated college biology really understand advanced concepts. mixed Romania. Old people definitely ones opposed masks, kids 15-25 also think immune. truly best East West mentality.

Mainstream media still debating whether masks infringe FREEDUMS.  That's one reasons effective vaccine hope.

Ideally, almost everyone get vaccine COVID-19 finally eradicated. not, least people care getting infected type protection idiots want wear masks. live, suburbs near Flint, MI, almost one wears mask. asked leave store days ago person wearing mask. told need business that's way think behave. 

I'm disillusioned whole thing. anti-maskers, conspiracy crowd, bully culture thriving US right now, feds taking away funding controlling information, feel safe comfortable living anymore. buddy 20 years medical field. said realize people dumb. think Diabetes type people also getting sick Covid-19. ""I dont really second guess anything"" words ""I dumb ox, dont think much"" Y’all act company going sell us mask filters cost making hand. way won’t expensive. wrong tbh, funny though people protest that

I mean... BLM protests large part also associated anti-over-policing groups. tired people answering posts without comprehending links. like paradise. school shootings mass covid infections. Point things reached level first place. Well done Vermont, lead example. everything wrong still went wrong. Ok, would agree everyone screams bloody murder awful China completely rocker? Repeating refrain spikes new cases largely due vast increase testing, DeSantis said news conference St. Augustine vast majority people diagnosed COVID-19 recent weeks symptoms unlikely need hospitalization.

Just pathetic. Completely thoroughly pathetic. Thank Brazil! Australia  U.S. citizens acting like children throwing tantrum really think country gunna start caring now? Really?  true 😣  know get downvoted still - edited title. edited titles rule sub

Stay safe friend What?!?? He’s fucking joke. It’s amazing many people think ONE person expert think better medicine choices. common steroids attention concentration oxygen showing reports marked improvements. dont fault monkey see protocols early death rate much less doom early models built in. mean, much higher Gen Z older voters, main point.

I'm also aggressively campaigning get people vote administration come November, fully expect cheat nearly every means possible try get win. proactive believe fact win this, remain vigilant dire situation is. seems clear reason Republican Governor would allow County municipality require masks citizens purely political calculation total disregard  human life.

If governor allows section state require Masks sections quickly gain benefit reduced Transmission reduction hospitalizations deaths. those  statistics (as compared rest state without mask requirement) would simple  math see many deaths Governor caused result requiring masks throughout state. Therefore governor going allowed masks required anywhere unless going require masks everywhere. requires masks everywhere assumption re-elected Republican base. Wow that’s real thing? Cringe  One dying still secret Democrat hoax. long con LOL /s lot like climate change. matter many studies produced, people continue deny science favour feelings, handful studies dissent current scientific consensus. people vote matter. matters counts votes.

It got worse there. lot people get hit did. wife didn't. got away basically bad flu. 

I'd get tested, man. confirmation save lot time need care hospital, save thinking it. Win/win.  live triangle. TBH, people see wearing masks indoors, general. Especially since governor made mandatory. specific area also rather heavy pasty sort. think would say white males likely masked before, true representation triangle state here.

As far ""evidence getting covid,"" clue situations likely contribute infection. around people briefly lower risk parties, dining in, work situations. zero risk (I certainly plan keep wearing mask public). wonder anyone done analysis contact tracing results show actual breakdown?

Heh, walked restaurant day pick takeout. creepy, many naked faces!  Lord, they'll gargling bleach Tuesday. I'm referring news reports hospitals saying ICU capacity governor spoke tried control narrative. I'm making claims beyond obvious reports Texas cases spiked opened thought future.... without experienced teachers whole educational system starting scratch trenches least. College training mediated experienced teachers &amp; staff supporting new teachers. Weird take (for parent).

But hey, want increase teacher burden &amp; burnout way go it. Teacher shortage teacher crisis. enough teachers effectively teach.

Bill Gates wants microchip everyone

All really respectable group intellectuals. interpreting statistics wrong way, odds young person dying infected COVID 0.2% 2 1000 odds young person getting infected dying way lower that.

When people talk odds dying COVID, talk infected, people general comparison lighting rod extremely wrong side.

COVID death sentence young people 0.2% cases even getting COVID likely getting hit lighting 99% kill even getting hit lighting unlikely. lol exactly strategy. Let COVID kill many people possible people start dying halllways lobbies, 911 calls overloaded ambulances can’t even respond calls anymore. Add ridiculously high death rate, higher pretty much country, state since, plus promotion using public transit, I’d say it’s super obvious Cuomo de blasio great job!!!! /s  True true, right I’m asking exercise caution. god. *we know anything long term effects virus.*

**Academic pressure** -- quarter parents Essity report said sent sick kid class child didn’t want miss something important like field trip.

Honestly hope there's gonna strike something. point math actually statistical data rules waning immunity (yet).

There overwhelming data contrary.

Published 19 July 2020 08:12 Yea know you’re lying. could 2 years investigation occurs turns company’s test results part sample kits specifically designed delay results.

But currently, proof isn’t available. tbh, even data provided, non-transparent lacking reliability sources, it’s hard totally convinced. I’ve looked past coroner’s dashboard Cook County Illinois, available download .csv. paints odd picture. Sort data truly analyze it. 

I believe COVID lethal, highly contagious masks absolutely necessary based data here. initial lockdowns answer, shouldn’t continue  wonder effective masks la ligne 13^^ , feel 
Anyways, agréé you, 99% people wear tramway Bordeaux, Mask usage supermarkets went lot. people wearing street (a good 3rd shoppers rue ste Catherine ( Thank you! hoodoo works wonders sometimes Well, yes no. Technically, sort true. However, reinventing wheels.

Half face respirators already exist 30 dollars piece, also reusable made silicone similar materials. filters varies design quality best particulate filters hard casings use technology HEPA filters. cost another 10-30 dollars (depending manufacturers). filter media cannot readily disinfected itself, HEPA filters mean virus bacteria trapped filter media going anywhere. hard casing filter means outside disinfected.

Studies conducted found filters wiped ethanol externally 3 months without loss integrity efficiency.

The problem new mask design exposed filters virus bacteria deposited make easier accidentally contaminate yourself.

I using mask filter set 6 months without problem. filters retain effectiveness breathing resistance increased. actually fairly complex system state determines active cases per county entire North East allows travel counties 400 active cases per million. See map methodology That's Bubonic Plague take. know I've told finding religion help restore faith humanity. know want lose 6 months, work customer service. No, that's lie sell. Nearly govt expansion last 50 years done conservatives. time conservatives actually favor less regulation guns corporate pollution. first part seemed crazy read service half, lol. people fucking delusional idiotic great pairing. Thank culture idk. It’s team effort. point wants people die. They've also locked longest rushing reopen once, big deal, that's animated map look, yup. anyone screaming anecdotes, go snap map see sooner realise noone cares better. sell things. We’re getting there! God, can’t wait go places normally. Holy shit. longer miss Astoria diners much. Wearing masks protect protect others. basically, people around protecting YOU. like return favour protect others wearing mask. 

You're right, can't save EVERYONE. TRY minimise risk save them. Wearing mask allow people actually allow leaders reduce restrictions allow people things. better allowing people increase risk falling sick, able work, overwhelming hospital systems?

I'm asthmatic healthcare worker living Singapore. wear mask long house unless I'm eating; way work, entire time I'm work, work way home. wear mask attend adult ballet classes 70+yo woman also wearing mask entire time. breathing issues us. 🤷🏻‍♀️ explain it? Maybe ton people already got locations, less population infected? instance NJ highest deaths per capita state probably strongest indication high infection rate. maybe since already many cases/deaths people like oh crap need take seriously?

I say simple highest urban population leading cases, easy explanations many new cases locations. Thank you. power densely populated, liberal, climate contributions, tons Democratic Congress people happen powerful Bernie Sanders.

POWER BERNIEEEEE thank Republican governor? Idiocy. Pure willful idiocy, dash shameless, opportunistic, arrogance, allows say confidence. open disdain minorities entire GOP platform. vodka? Cause I’m good :D got gallons here! Yep, hence parents live there, grew up.there.. 2/4 kids born I'm GA. 

Regretting life choices trying catch 'rona wish true. 

But, every idiot fills hospital bed. forces several others to. 

The cold truth is, anti-maskers *also* people. cannot make ""vanish"". stop hurting rest us change minds. 

I know way make happen is. think effort try convince wasted. might even ethical thing one do. That's great hear according excess mortality Vermont close top list reporting COVID deaths. K. can't prove anything b/c would get fired. Choose ignore wish, I'm lying. isolating home Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream, confirm it’s helping contracting COVID-19. hear:

Lot country's schools opened 

They never add

 also less cases state's get day Hydroxychloroquine use since 1955. developmental phase all. RIP everyone lost horrible virus. lost 30yo friend it. I'm reading, Vermont open business. start GoFundMe account. couldn’t bothered wear mask protect us supposed help pay medical bills? selfishness people incredible. remember helping mom move Montana. swear exits interstate lead single home. Uhh Gen Z heavily favored Bernie. know many peers interested politican first time devastated care election. Luckily democrats need bunch teenagers twenty year olds win elections.  Yes! Maybe soon figure out.. sad 160,000+ deaths average year, causes, far US. already way higher yearly flu deaths, lot time 2021.  gonna send Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan month goes NY's progress. Glad I'm upstate. also i've heard everywhere world nursery homes much strict agree. party platform government problem, going capable using power government find solutions government achieve. One thing saddens we're hearing failings capitalism crisis. Capitalism lot benefits clearly poorly suited healthcare arena. absolute shock one. certainly exactly that, mostly shielded parents money, I'm also pointing choose so. lot people struggling years ago, leads ""what's point"" style carelessness think people tend underestimate. unemployment rate back Great Recession levels minimum, things get much worse many unemployment payments extended end month evictions return (which certainly hit far young people).

But again, I'm trying observe many trends among network without traveling much pandemic. speak I'm aware of. We'll see. nothing good , boomer culture needs die everything it. It’s shit like makes want renounce US citizenship tbh  Also, vaccine developed vaccine tested throughly, mass produced, distributed taken enough population make difference. Remember March, everyone going bonkers. yes, would help people getting numb numbers. possible trump super carrier Good thing Congress write pass bills.

Unless anything egregious bill, pass veto proof majority? never critisized vote mail? love it. want many people possible easy access voting. national holiday election day. Voting rights released felons. Everyone vote easy.

I want post master general putting anything would interfere slow process. Every American citizen receive mail ballot participate. done GOP. No. longer allowed leave homes exercise outside, work, shop essentials take care others another household

It also noted orders enforced unlike US. problem is. argue you’re blue face whether business closed open restrictions, home socializing problem is.

The best way combat would provide safer alternatives. Stop demonizing parks beaches, stop demanding people live like shut-ins. doesn’t work reasons teaching abstinence-only sex education doesn’t work: People going engage activity matter what, message “there way safely” won’t take steps all.

Make masks mandatory, enforce social distancing *encourage* people go outdoor settings risk transmission tiny fraction indoors. public likely listen say “don’t people house” it’s accompanied safer alternatives.  gonna lie, I’ve heard way worse ideas. Disappointing shameful comment age well.... Maybe telling get bad idea. qualified teacher I’d looking private instruction. Imagine rates could charge wealthy parents right now. think US first stage. ehy rest world surging second time? blame China everything getting ridiculous china made mistakes faults see anyway responsible America's failures. American measurement get crazier everyday. Yes, critical difference people intelligent believe everything hear, people think intelligent believe anything hear. Oh godness.  Definitely. Hearing much death tragedy, staying home without much social contact bound mess brain. Refusing wear face mask extremely visible incurs risk getting debilitating disease

Actually main problem wearing mask incurs risk *transmitting* debilitating disease. Masks protect around protect you. forgotten one thing, though. Aside schools reopening, lack paid family/sick leave, lack mask mandate, fact takes time virus spread:

""NOOOO CAN'T DRIVE VERMONT CITY'S EPICENTER OUTBREAK!!""

""*haha leaf change color*"" Netherlands - it’s everywhere I’d say so. “Waves” okay metaphor use Hong Kong distinct breaks local cases, although always small number. 100 cases easily record daily total would qualify part wave smaller baseline.

It’s obviously better situations many countries, take look map article. shows infected people live visited many different parts city. many infections small, crowded space Hong Kong concerning called “third wave”. signed online classes. I’m college. live southern Florida...

I’m APPALLED campuses wide open. expecting registering classes, see great chunk virtual only. Nope. Complete opposite! Even needed take strictly campus. 

I won’t full-time student once, then... easier contain Xinjiang, contain Beijing problem, much less traffic. y'all 'muricans always going number 1, number 1 prisoner population, number 1 total debt, number 1 coronavirus waves... i'd tired dodging damn victorious bullet train 

while 'poor' central-eastern european country see less prosperity comparison US still see predominantly sane people thankful Who's Governor there? Oh yea. Silver best GM NA sports eyes NBA. fuck up, would recommend everyone else bail. Anyone half brain would know stupid idea. would provoking another civil war turning Trump martyr. referral?? notice less antibodies bloodstream months...but doesn’t mean immune. body remembers pathogens exposed body likely make antibodies. still learning virus less antibodies normal. clearly stated believe better suited deal Hilary would faced extremely hostile Congress. dont know called ""coronavir"". drug shipped Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan name ""Aviaphir"" Here’s upvote. Take good luck. live South humbly disagree. demographics changing. moved north years ago growing nearly 3 decades look different think anymore.

And yes, know effects rural small towns. Gerrymandering redistricting remains major issue, era 2016 in. independent support Trump nowhere near solid then, HUGE key factor everyone keeps missing. ""Memeing Trump"", will, lot bigger back then. Nearly energy gone now.

Trump administration cheat means necessary, however. sure of, that's encouraging turnout critical. reason i've got bug ass false sense security. abso-fucking-lute worst thing get ego, tell we're safer we're smarter

Shouldn't annoyed back patting instead harping rural factor people bringing up? comes across kind like ""no that's reason, we're better everything else."" seem explicitly want fellow statesmen mindset of. UCP party created last election (it’s Conservative party new name, re-absorbed previously splintered elements) NDP formed government history Alberta. 

On federal level, two parties ever formed government Liberal party Conservative party, I’m sure you’ve heard those.

Don’t worry, Canada, like America, never worry remembering name party main two parties. [The first past post system ensures Good him. girlfriend went ER recently vitals, told could help referred University Miami Trauma Center. got bill mail $15,000. one wants listen, want comply, matter what.

Bigger chance though could end unfortunately. moved US Canada Bush years, back everything seemed hopeless. churches really drawing criticism Christian community. 
I would like point churches gotten big basically like company, companies can't afford shut might essentially go broke.
Most churches stopped person gatherings, least local area I've heard churches opening doors services.
Also, opinion, gathering right equivalent tempting/testing God. Facts simple, disease much likelier spread service, crowds higher risk due average age. Knowing facts defying God protect like jumping roof saying God catch you, faith, testing God, sin, make nice splatter ground. mac get latest American coronavirus cases right menu bar. need constantly check online latest numbers: ""ruralness"" gonna mean precisely jack fucking shit leaf peepers come fall. Manchester's crowded city I've ever tourists come.

People thread know shit Vermont. ""ruralness"" abso-fucking-lutely *nothing* like rural west. That's goddamn fact.  Oh God, stupid people? I'm tired people calling Sweden well. Sweden higher death per capita US economy projected contract least bad took early measures. Literally every friend mine’s story Instagram today bars, without masks. give up, man. seems many East Asian countries close calls SARS, learned them, consequence handled Covid way better western countries, including widespread mask usage. Casino worker well, 1000% agree. Based anecdotal evidence think dexamethasone definitely benefit hypoxic patients. Remdesivir mostly given ICU patients ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), hard say I’ve seen direct benefit. also recent study showed reduced hospital stay, don’t think significant effect morality. I’ve seen patients get meds recover, futile. current data showing use two meds follow research. I’ve never seen anything like though, we’ve changed treatments multiple times past 4 months... Yet U.K. plans remain secondary school return late august social distancing masks. It’s allowed fester due lack leadership collected one month ago, pretty optimistic comment thought. waitress El Torito got shingles. open sores serving arm contagious chicken pox (people can't catch shingles you, basically weird recurrence chicken pox give folks that). called let boss know would take several weeks addition lot pain nobody wants get served food someone arm herpes, acted like lazy. parents pitched rent month, back know would done. I'm really worried false sense security people thread.

Rural areas probably way danger covid19 urban areas. Yes, know hospitals get overwhelmed... even single case covid19 capable wiping doctor grocery clerk 50+ miles people rural areas. That's baseline problem.

The mysticism Vermonters another problem. demigods much responsible mortal neighbors states safe without mask mandate safe schools reopening. ""ruralness"" mean precisely jack fucking shit leaf peepers come, too. Manchester, VT every bit urban anywhere else leaves change color. 

We're going get fucked. Hard.  may draw due masks, worn impoverished folk. Excellent work Vermont   school, old job (where capability work completely remote) sent email one morning team wfh coming cold want spread throughout office. got reply boss basically said take sick day approve working home day. whole stigma needs die, sick, stay fuck home.  many times seen article miracle mask? many count. many times seen said mask sale? 0. dont think anyone tried call San Quetin reeducation center. obviously prison journalist wanted video proof prison would probably get okay verify prison.

And million people Xinjang, place 1/70th PRC's population, imprisoned...

Then leaves 550,000 prisoners rest PRC since report 1.55m prisoners. words, people Xinjiang 135 times likely prison rest PRC.

They must REALLY like breaking laws Xinjiang. Best avoid province. vocal minority. every single one damn threat. US. Europe. probably one worst mistakes lead lot people mistrusting Gouvernements Health authorities.  need Florida man crazy, florida company also good enough crazy...

""Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., American supermarket chain headquartered Jacksonville, Florida."" Source Wikipedia  CDC recommended waiting fourteen days decreasing cases reopening, state close achieving that. recommendation still same, states public ignore again? Goodbye  threaten Brittish economy. that’s worth going war threaten German economy. that’s worth going war threaten Chinese economy. that’s worth going war threaten Russian economy. that’s worth going war threaten Egyptian economy. that’s worth going war over

Are sure wanna make thing again? nation home billion people.
So get leeway. worse right-wing brutal authoritarian dictatorship? healthcare system leaves uninsured

Are talking Biden Trump? Literally pandemic, Trump trying kill 3 months reinfection definitely thing. I've talking month now.

My dr/nurse friends people test positive twice second time worse organs still damaged first time. 

Multiple celebraties tested twice there's lots blogs Dr's patients tested positive twice 3 months apart. 

The Oxford study also says 4x better normal antibodies last year, also know lasts around 3 months. 


People seem think invincible not. going get worse. damage organs permanent. see how, NHL already got approval since teams staying bubble cities, traveling US. Brian Kemp, literally. refused excuse Sec. State position(they run state's election...) election... wonder states cities “Vermont vibes” without cold? place impossible find? America dream even achievable point? Thank you! I'm thinking exact thing - Trump incapable introspection.l don’t go there. Stay fuck home. remove president 25th, need everything impeachment PLUS more.

For 25th, need supermajority parts congress instead Senate like impeachment. 

People get hung cabinet part, part important -any time 25th could used removal, impeachment could used instead actually easier.   mean that's believe reddit. look military police pulling people streets unmarked cars Portland. little brother's girlfriend changed mind pursuing M.Ed. now. quote her, ""I'd better staying assistant manager ice cream shop teacher.""  guy named King.  temporary bro. pets kids? strangely godsend mental health moment, helps remind us what's important Also Patrick Leahy, Sanders we’ll known, assume. “Oooooklahoma........where Covid comes sweeping plains “ 
This one couple good suggestions. feasible back school setting, not.  


  
Basically reinforcement first article, leaves open individual brainstorming work process students know. Basically set guidelines, opposed examples suggestions. 

  
Lots covid related social stories, including masks, busses, distancing. know work people autism, direct, point, easy remember easy repeat social stories help son (7, moderate function). prefer windixie. SFL

Them Publix big supermarket chains here. hell they? stay lockdown forever mean shit government implementing contact tracing enforcing mask orders guys shuttle program. still salute that. stop zero negative numbers big beautiful like never seen? Believe me. already has

In Portland Trump say kidding slowing testing down. coronavirus caused people tested it. Past tense noted. Gov. Opens plastic water bottle, rears back show find water inside barely see people wear masks Vermont either, own!

Trump saying. can’t believe defended dumb ass making point us testing made comments. didn’t get point across he’s buffoon. Wrong, still one ravaged Wuhan US. Remember, Italy politicized virus early on, trying sound racist. Hug Chinese campaign likely contributed high initial infection. articles countries saying Vaccine end year, October, November etc even US vaccines. Personally? know I'd fully trust vaccine made 6-9 months. weird ill get downvoted first couple months people subreddit saying thing. everyone seems wanting jump first one available. Yeah hope too. people get businesses without roads? 

The roads paid public tax dollars. Imagine entire street filled businesses allow black people enter, yet black people community pay taxes pay street. obviously denying people full usage hard earned tax dollars. 

If businesses want private roads, firefighters, police force, discriminate hearts content.

But live reality, Supreme Court upheld protected classes, *definition* constitutional. creating dichotomy. think anyone denying existence prisons administrative regions country world. That's direct evidence to. 

I think Chinese journalists interviews inside San Quentin. astronomical leap go say extermination camp. Cool story bro Hearing encouraging That’s good one Best way, go visit China yourself. convince co-worker mine set foot country. goes every year, agenda liberate Chinese evil CCP. patently simple. I'm making 900 week sitting ass would work earn Earlier, initial outbreak, remember reading one reasons faster virus spread winter lack humid air. 

Meaning viral particles likely hang air longer, dry winter air evaporates moisture around them. allows float around longer instead falling along w ""droplets"" exhale. 

Don't know, passing info along.. lame duck period going fricking nightmare. Trump send ton crazy destructive executive orders recalled, he'll try best get rid competent people gov't people like DeVos destroy departments control create chaos incoming administration. Trump admin actively work prevent smooth handover transition power. course he'll pardon every right wing sleeze ball sun maybe going far Ky's governor Matt Bevin releasing pedophiles rapists like Trump tried call election results invalid made lies support that.

I've seen people say Trump would rage quit wish we'd get lucky he's malignant narcissist rage destroy much Nov Jan 20th. 

Pretty sure Biden's inauguration draw lot Trump's least nice way kick fat ass way out. mean take see administration pursuing unstated goal pandemic? possibly say NY hit worst world Florida 50% new daily cases present? Something something population density? Aww poor thing  parent gassy 8 year old confirm experiments pants... do... help...  Considering Christianity death cult, somehow reasonable think caring people's health something opposition would do.  gargle 120 proof whiskey. think helped honest, really knocked back sore throat. New York’s handling correct? Mass gatherings without precautions, forced taking covid patients nursing homes thereby killing thousands elderly, prepping hospitals proper gear supplies ventilators? live NC cant tell stressful see people wearing masks. promise still people taking seriously, stay safe. ...can say louder people back? pm tweet, follow-up 'bombshell report'? work one largest NYC hospital orgs would love laugh ignorance.  Eh like every day years didn’t wanna go. Playing video games fun 7? Great news!  sideways look Trumps giving Fauci thumbnail perfectly encapsulates Trump feels anyone who's intelligent him. London? agree. think elementary schools/daycare priority reopenings, mitigation measures ventilation, outdoors possible, distancing, etc. Epidemiologists looked different methods found age, kids much less likely cause outbreaks. 16 year old, deeply misanthropic shiba inu could better job. wakes 40 minutes per day.  Man, rabbit hole go down. read pretty decent write Qanon back. find I'll link you, I'd imagine someone else something already. gentleman's agreement reigns lot power works people power openly hungry sharks Love baseball, love Jays. I'm fucking relieved Feds stood ground said no. blows mind MLB making teams fly across US right now.

Not mention Jays play Miami, Tampa, Atlanta... Hell no. bring shit back #There many forms propaganda. Thank you. P20 makes annoying yellow spots cant washed out. good. Could spent 12 hours african sun it. Fauci supports sending old folks virus back group living get everyone else infected too?

What asshole. new York fuck sending covid patients nursing homes tho? one knows sure yet. much conflicting info moment including doctors swearing get twice. 

Reality, regardless every armchair scientist says... know sure think counterintuitive? China building concentration camps trying reduce Uighur populations, would make perfect sense nothing let virus reduce native population. Try thinking instead letting media fill head. clients Beijing we’re literally locked houses. shit wouldn’t fly here. Sure - whole country fall in-step model exactly NY did! /s

Unfortunately PA 😑 live near big university campus US. house parties drive ridiculous. masks anywhere, everyone huddled together. so, dumb. Almost 35,000 people died covid New York. state second deaths, California, 7,000. New York total undeniable failure fight Covid-19.

Edit: New York also 1,600 deaths per 1,000,000 people. California 195. Cuomo didn’t shut state MARCH 26. rest case, New York completely failed it’s fight covid. adjust New York’s population/death count compare CDC estimates total case fatality rate covid, begin see covid killed almost HALF number people New York going die it. wouldn’t consider effective quashing virus. also important note many, many people hospitalized covid survive now, due newfound therapeutic methods treatments. However, New York’s catastrophe due late stay home orders absence masks. Look melatonin slso breathing exercises ""When test more, positive cases. said 'Let's slow testing down.'""

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  important note [other (which go different way) found kids 0-9 (per study) elementary/daycare age kids (per studies) appear much less likely transmit virus, although risk still zero. policy implications could perhaps help us learn disease transmitted. That’s unease rests. kids getting ill recovered. may small number, it’s big think worries people Requirement masks coming UK read news? Winter comming! Lol well well well Wait ski season, gonna bad one. Total have. first batch year. I’m sorry, no. Hate like... acceptable response actions. It’s incredibly binary shut way sooner prevent people governs dying. fundamentally failed job. could economic societal death I'm currently witnessing. sad Florida ceased democracy. Perhaps good citizens Florida give right 'Recall' officials.  voted dems could probably get put thing vote.

Personally, think think every state allow could draw line somewhere say, asshole problem. Get out! gonna relocate him? gonna pay way? Find job? Take care family might leaving behind? lmao people dense. iPhone user here. ad blockers device didn’t see single ad website. Soooo I'm looking move AZ next month start residency 2021 school year. Probably bad time move, yeah? would helpful lived country question.

Queues wrapping around **car parks**, shops were:

1. Limiting number people could shop given time
2. Enforcing social distancing queues, people 2m away one another. amazing much longer makes queues! I'm not. Wearing mask *does stop catching virus*. Yet that's sub constantly parroting moment, that's also title suggests. despite wearing one. could wearing one everyday, would still got virus.

That's point I'm making. constant pushing masks better methods reason people believe work do. UK less 30% mask usage entire time, cases low, today even 1% infection tests.  Oh, way! Wow, child biological mechanics adult. would that? Wow, mind absolutely blown! Thank God people funded could get bottom obviously Lizard movement. Thank you. Trust plan, guys!!!!! You’re using single fact excusing worst death rate planet like guy charge pretending good job. 

You’re idiot pushing narrative think place worst death rate planet somehow using model follow. Impeach again. Cartoonish levels evil. Captain Planet villains subtle. This. Fuck ""Operation Warped Speed"". Sounds like something child came with. No, believes chances re-election higher hide numbers (reducing testing, collecting hospitalization data) encouraging everyone go back normal routines again. economy crashed everyone's fearful going out. wants remove fear, remove fear, wants start fudging numbers.

It's gone straight incompetence straight malevolence. Telling millions die economy roar back life help win re-election strategy. Unfortunately, can't bullshit away like many problems. Honestly, amazed Trump _still_ president sitting white house. amazing level tolerance Americans international community Trump's actions. example, UK publicly denouncing policies, we're seeing civil war amongst people result.

This man killing people without firing single bullet. Thousands men, women children die result actions (for example, lack hospital treatment medical issues due shortages staff). History kind administration American people tolerating 4 years.

Had Trump others administration died would likely seen survivors pandemic, instead, many sacrificed needlessly.

We one day dead people read threads wondering fuck went wrong. advances society data collection systems built still can't handle pandemic properly human beings suck balls.

I hope 2025 next pandemic better actually hold elected leaders account.

This great example natural selection/survival fittest action, opinion Relative Washington state, first cases country went work-from-home isolation almost immediately, thus avoiding hospital overload even full loads? NY moved infected patients nursing homes overflowed morgues weeks Washington got hit? figure that's ""blazing fast""?

New York still leading country deaths. That's something hold example right. forget hotel collapse people quarantined inside Revolutionary technology however probably wise take news grain salt companies likely report work promising might be.

Still even 50% accurate good news. literally going kill lot them. seems Trump administration moved facade incompetence downright willful malevolence now. 😰 expert. Based know discussions Peak Prosperity, think would definitely possible. simple way engineer select harmless virus sufficient similarities SARS-CoV-2, test animals. T-cell response sufficiently provoked without lot side effects, human trials. see working out, expert immunology. problem USA fact many people religious, think “God” prevent getting sick, hoax general. That’s main problem don’t believe science. Thank god. Specifically, SDS SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate).

It's caustic substance high concentrations handled utmost practically every soap, shampoo, hygiene product.!&lt; live North Carolina people aren’t taking seriously even everyone wears masks Wegmans. yesterday watched manager offer patron choice disposable mask escort car. 


Wegmans isn’t putting bullshit that’s drive way way shop there. gottem LOL! government probably spreads additional conspiracy theories keep people confused enough recognize real conspiracies see them.  worry conspiracies later turn real. GOOGLE = Gazillions Obvious Goons Looking Everywhere Simultaneously. nice distraction sure, we're going watch TV anyway. seeing Jays play Buffalo Florida much different knowing Toronto, still needing watch TV. think 3 months experience treating something gives people edge fatality rates?

The population density NY versus Florida also fucking joke, Florida come close NY, especially NY got hit right away knew widespread was, complete utter failure. random doc making statement, Dr. Saag one worlds foremost virologists That’s really nice hear someone that’s coming back NJ school soon read earlier US secured 300 million doses AstraZeneca? longer case? Yup. He's fascist tyrant. advisor said morning want distracted virus intention anything it.  likewise Wales, likewise 1-2% people I'd guess wearing masks - even fewer correctly. 10-20 cases day still falling.

Social distancing, banning travel 5 miles stop new seeding events, track trace worked extremely effectively. I’m parent two small kids. last four months harder anything ever thought I’d deal with. still don’t support in-person learning fall, think need protect teachers’ lives.

But attitude helping. wife decided start family five years ago (long virus ever existed), total agreement careers important. would work, send children daycare later public schools aftercare. Schools never closed day two entire lives, snow days hurricanes. signed 30-year mortgage three-bedroom apartment well within price range, required us work less continuously small gaps months unemployment. I’ve paying public schools tax dollars 20 years without ever enrolling child. government owes “free” education daughter, scheduled start kindergarten fall.

So yeah, it’s extremely difficult trying work full time last four months kids around day. It’s worth killing teachers get relief here. situation — four months utter government failure contain pandemic, asking two-income households become homeschool teachers. hour Zoom instruction expect parents print worksheets craft projects kids. We’re Zoom meetings day work. employers real understanding first weeks this, expect us available meetings business hours make deadlines. don’t want hear kids anymore. younger childless coworkers constantly available distractions home. need two incomes avoid defaulting mortgage losing everything we’ve ever worked for. One us quitting homeschooling option.

And work remotely, suffered loss income crisis. parents called back physical workplace, won’t able go schools aren’t open. parents trouble putting food table need go back work. parents mental health issues can’t continue like longer.

So that’s political pressure coming from. don’t agree it, favor national gap-year education. people hand-wave away shut schools “tough shit, that’s problem, thought wife decided housewife,” it’s really upsetting. interested controlling narrative controlling disease. trying tell say “but it’s protecting me” say protects others convention pretty much majority Republican area. Pick random town.

The actual leaders better show though, they're going put people's lives risk. made fun us COVID hotspot stayed strong followed rules almost it. western southern states takimg heat, probably cause havent passed high school science classes Even 10 people hospital, Ireland lockdown completely. bars serve food open table service, bars supposed closed August 10th bars claiming restaurants. Regular bars wait 10th August open. People work office encouraged keep working home, public transport allowing 25% normal capacity ireland still rule 2 (6 ft) social distancing. goes like this.

Infected. 2-6 days symptoms. 3-8 days symptoms get bad enough go ER. 1-4 days end ventilator. 6-10 days die. 5-8 days death reported. Dr Ashley Bloomfield. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 mind blown covid isnt hoax. point, contact tracing even solve problem? mean, virus widespread US, many asymptomatic cases, never even figure 1% cases.  smoke weed month. guess ill roll one now. basically regulatory bodies ensuring Moderna due diligence. Sounds good honestly. agree that.

Doing nothing chances getting virus might 5% whatever.

Taking vaccine, even 50% chance getting placebo, 60% effectiveness whatever, either nothing decrease chance getting virus. Vaccines give virus. ""Next time we'll better"" really loses punch realize pandemic barely century ago population apparently learned nothing and, anything, worse. I'm sure people time optimistic. ignored bad policy exposing seniors infected. Correctly going waste time this. Google - see raised high possibility past week. Time tell.

You're choosing ignore replace hopes narrative. Oh definitely know people it, none even hospitalized worse. Diabolical. also think refusal share info CDC shaken lot people, regardless politics lie.

Sadly, suspect ""a lot"" still mean ""most"" referring lean right. meant daily cases. 15k+ Florida vs NY's 11.5k. thought obvious guess specific. no, dismissing deaths. May rest peace NY elsewhere. recognize poly parents (multiple polygamous parents birth certificate), poly marriage would legal right werent Christian fundamentalists use poly excuse collect abuse child brides.

Thank explaining symptoms. next question, rest us get it, LOL. 11 happened. mean NY let virus burn entire population much areas 60% people antibodies? 

Sweden proved sensible solution may involve complete shutdown Florida may prove well  don’t get second wave yet haven’t stopped calmed first. Good France prepping.  Luckily aren’t thing exponential case growth orderly worked three 2 weeks prior becoming symptomatic. 

I going mention did. Sweden's problem, too. 

Now THAT, concede, would almost impossible plan for. 

still... tents Central Park hospital ship Hudson went unused. send COVID patients NY nursing homes leave giant hospital ship Hudson sit around empty? just... mean, I'm saying anything Cuomo said himself. admits GIANT fuck-up. man allowed human admits mistake. learned. Keep truckin' Cuomo! Don’t people make fun Ron Paul lot far right types (not saying Paul shit) saying every year year going year bubble bursts, coming prepare year etc etc etc. depending who’s office much shit take it, different? put fucking chip Jamba Juice.

Qanons stupid... Ohhhhhh beaches? problem? Nothing else? Nothingggggg else happened 5 weeks straight put finger on? beaches opened 2 months ago? That’s was? *Really?!* New record coming Monday  would massive waste resources attempt track large portion country let alone america.

China entered chat lost likely don't, pretty much zones hit covid significant excess deaths average, take years really tally deaths caused pandemic. send senior citizens hospital get flu hospital best chance Cuomo empty hospital beds sent sick infected senior citizens nursing homes equipped handle it.

At end March, order issued, state's Covid-19 hospitalization projection many 140,000 hospital beds would required.

The entire state capacity 53,000. Cuomo operating based advice best doctors epidemiologists.  big world, bound anomalies mysteries there. people get critically ill second time, first time dangerous?  Trump taken side coronavirus. going pay way hopes people start dropping like flies. That’s terrible. Im really sorry shouldn’t like this. trying idiot. get it. take look downvotes every posts here.  math hard you? Nice job Vermont! post links behind paywall? There's pandemic going ya know. broke af. drove stopped get gas Indiana... like WTF people insane stations least 50-100 people, toll stop, one mask. also become great example happens revolutions prevail.

But thats also useful example, truthfully, French revolution devolve insanity, following revolutions would prove point did. Reddit man. sub teenagers rub much smarter everyone else. Reading beyond misleading headline rules. Somehow, NY already peak first wave. 

Yours still ramping. ... apps devices track moves access every site visit, plus personal information people share social media... He's way ahead you. Morons often shocked stupidity comes back bite them. That’s they’re morons. It’s Alabama. barely protections here. Really? deaths low, economy isn’t absolutely destroyed. personally know business owners wouldn’t survived one week lockdown without permanently closing forever. Walk Manhattan it’s literally exact opposite. Countless businesses closed lease signs front. record number renters can’t pay rent. know friends worked Manhattan. New York apocalyptic right now. 

I know, know. guys went deaths, hospitalizations, cases. ""After all, we're human."" Um... didn't. South Korea *correctly*. New York got **fucked** realized maybe fucking take seriously. meant Friday two weeks earlier? outdoor location somewhere people physical activity (swimming, heavy breathing, hiking) busy area 99.9% following mask guidelines. time area overlapped sick person 4 hours. 2 meters people. wore mask majority time there. 

I know person pretty confidently say likely wearing mask. Hundreds upon hundreds people recall thinking annoyed guidelines enforced. 

I apparently close enough trigger government monitoring thing even though outdoor space. 100% monitoring works though. Shabak oversees process obviously discussing it. 

Hope clear. really hard think sick virus. Willful defiance... 

At point they're unwilling admit maybe wrong, continue living lie hope fulfill self fulfilling prophecy.

But wont. insanity. reading know. high praise given NY little real experience base strategies. places density additional information. ...  one thing critisize New York though, reacted really bad already. unfortunately lot states seem follow example regard. increase restrictions order mask wearing already bad. Well let’s go dinner looks like giant plastic bubble hold virus in. marinate it.  Hot humid thick Texas air holding in. 

See pitcher water holding. touches spout every glass refills. assure getting washed day. gets washed emptied tossed shelf end day (that’s happens breaks) Basically, French kissing everyone restaurant day.  Gross. Enjoy heated Sysco.

If you’re like well get soda/tea refills. That’s even worse. workers put soda gun cup refills use cup push back mechanism. never, ever get cleaned. you’re drinking licking every single person that’s ever drink there. weak germs die. strong ones thrive. happy it. Yeah, that's math works. 

It's good fucked. I’m haven’t seen anyone wearing mask. work public I’ve absolutely issues. Sometimes remind people, sometimes nose, good job Stop testing goes away, right? 'Covid' becomes 'flu' becomes 'pneumonia' kids go back school parents go back work economy gets better Trump gets beat chest proclaim he's powerful great totes deserves re-election. 

Narcissistic, murderous asshole. Entertainers boost morale increase compliance mask-wearing social distancing. making weird strawman argument people apparently think masks absolute protection, nobody's making argument. average mask absolutely *helps* protect others droplet transmission, aerosolized transmission. That's n95s for. None perfect, nobody's arguing perfect. heard someone large trucking company today (their routes require crossing border allowed along) Trump wants border opened immediately Trudeau holding firm 2021.

Be real interesting see plays out. I'm pulling 2021.  Like this... Wow seriously? Honestly thought Texas would ride die whatever Trump wants like Florida. Like I've boatload criticism Gov Abbot, serious move what's best Texas rather keeping head sand fantasy everything okay. mean fact remains pushed Texas reopen way, way early, I'll give credit fact appears willing admit wrong. lot people essentially incapable that. Well... mean... kinda of... the... power... to... ya know... allow that....  First, sorry difficult. trooper I'm sure kids lucky parent working hard manage crazy situation. 

I think keeping kids home way keeps cases low kids would spread it, parents relieved watching kids return office, cases go up. adults passing illness adults. 

I predict see cases explode fall parents return office kids go back school. indirect result schools back session. 

Anyway, minimize frustrations problems arguing keeping schools closed. fact cases go adults return offices. Yes agree. Buffalo Blue Jays anyone double digit Iq find guy credible anymore. Apparently biggest outbreak area highest death rates country sending infected people senior homes correct.  Yeah Ireland! 



Please help fight fear? ignorance.  far tightly packed trenches theory, don’t think holds water. 

The typical immunity curve see flu (which kills immunocompromised: ie young children elderly) saw huge distinct peak ages 28-30. typical pandemic, would see deaths age group, would small compared children 6 adults 65. people packed together, doesn’t mean mortality rate would go up. one got infected Friday. /s Jackbooted thugs rolling around unmarked vans wearing insignia kidnapping people streets.

Im worried vaccine making sterile something weird. making way prone die another virus. knows. Bill gates literally said world population major problem. thats sketchy.

That’s really interesting; would kinda indicate/support idea infectious dose determines severity illness I've reading sketchy tales ""re-infection"". Guess might herd immunity all. Especially given know coronaviruses immunity year. Who's then? watching right wing conspiracy video today absolute garbage lead interesting series articles heavily Cuomo New York mandating nursing homes take COVID patients giving away effectively opt ill equipped handle load. articles NYT, WSJ AP focusing grave error can’t know true impact likely caused several thousands deaths huge portion nursing home deaths New York states similar policies like NJ PA. However googled nursing home deaths. found NYTs database tracked number nursing home deaths %nursing home deaths total COVID deaths per state 44 states sufficient data New York far lowest percent nursing home deaths. course NY total deaths still lot states policies low nursing death rates compared rest country except PA. don’t really know make that. thought controversy pretty interesting. Title gore Dude 32,000 dead citizens, great job Cuomo did! Herd immunity enough immunity within population prevent spread virus, without taking additional measures (such social distancing). infectious virus (i.e. easily jumps person person), people need immunity prevent spread.

Current estimates COVID-19 least 70% population need immune achieve herd immunity. Sweden nowhere near - current estimates herd immunity 17.6% Stockholm, affected area Sweden: 3D 666. checkmate! could say descriptor.... trumps other. fail see point all. reason continue conversation further. end day I’ll back tell awful NY comparison rest US stay tuned. I’ll follow every 30 days. Jesus. Arizona 7.2 million people. every US state death rate like we'd losing 7,000 people day. Luckily lot smart people country.

*""It like throwing lit match onto haystack,"" said Borghetti, spoke directive time. ""Some facilities refused take positive patients. \[take in\], devastating.""* 

So Cuomo exactly Italy Officials said do! kept May 10th! state highest death rate right? Okay lol. might doomsayer, might exaggerating, saying past 3 years; social media plague 21st century. 225k cases NYC. population 8.7 million. can't speculate unconfirmed/untested cases there's whole lot uninfected people catching figured out.

South Carolinian reporting - said 👆 Blame poor brown people guess. website like worldmeters going useless government takes hold data, continue nearly real time reporting? always assumed data sent local level states states sent somewhere, sites like worldmeters got somewhere. nitpick, it’s exactly disinformation gets perpetrated fact regarding COVID — one wants bring facts fear called “denier”. deliberate. wonder would say thing surgeon going perform heart surgery them? ""Masking satanic ritual, doc, worry it. Spit chest cavity. could go wrong?""

I seriously doubt it. seriously guys downvoting this?

mass hysteria Actually death COVID-19 real enemy, Gov. is, besides enemy trump. Dont worry, months left till longer charge. Nope, start getting relaxed--well, look what's happening US. That's bold strategy cotton. exactly gave impression I'm helping work towards body positivity? 😶 Pure coincidence. Put bunch hoaxers hospital's? sound like good idea me.... taking things one day time. Hey dumbass find out? Exactly alluding downvotes show uninformed idiots taking internet facts. Ron DeSantis kids old enough. way, information I've waiting for. answer questions focus high risk behavior - indoor gatherings close friends family. also teach high school. I'm tired people arguing less 100% students last year ""engaged"" online learning. Step almost classroom. Plenty kids truancy officer says be. engaged. Kids fail classes even entire grade levels every single year. 

When switched online learning March last year every single kid logging completing assignments **already failing** previous grading periods. Every. single. one. I'm glad read it. Perhaps consider deleting initial comment realized false. cooled bit now.

Heat index 90s instead 110s. south great. Outline link:  Yeah, think “nicecream” great alternative. make people believe satisfy though. Even thought would like really cold baby food made myself. mixed dark chocolate cashews. good. is.

Rodents fleas humans Ah yes google, unbiased reliable source there! Never manipulated results owner totally didnt attend Democratic meetings  None tentative plans district address this. admin simply thinks students responsible/empathetic enough follow guidelines. Get real. Teachers consumed policing students wear masks, stay apart, stop touching each-other, quit hugging, wash hands, etc. quality education drastically drop. kid old enough stay home, that's need learn. kids young, government needs step pay family's young children stay home elementary kids spread small class sizes around district middle high schools use. Yeah crazy. High attendance esteemed. away ""perfect"" attendance. exclusively call misery. Every time someone corrects I'm like yes misery, that's said. really understand Reddit suddenly forgiven Bush starting illegal wars destroying civil liberties current guy office *also* fucking twat. maybe extremists china them? studies shown children effective spreading virus. legitimate question study.  That's clever approach using extra space disperse.

I guess absence good national guidance we're getting state state district district experimentation. Seems like could look around find best practices mess. shit  Right. document reinfection, talking someone either positive PCR clear true positive serology test i.e. measurable antibodies, insta test ""you're pregnant."" statistical inference. 

The population people *confirmed* positive *and* live area COVID spreading still/again *and* better months *and* live area widely test low probability cases large. relative entire pandemic. Pregnant women staying home taking better care themselves. False positives extremely rare. False negatives common. (It’s easy miss something (the virus) swan isn’t done correctly amount present minimal, easy detect something isn’t actually there) Really.

Ok know hard requires thought. find pointing death count productive. want say deaths horrible real damage either survive disabled might develop chronic illness lost someone. Also studies correct Corona make infertile also count babies born. many migh already affected could already 50+ million. I'm actually afraid becoming infirtile dieing. Death come us I'm afraid want children. Sure adopt end infirtile want dad right start. Trump's base going go away does, unfortunately. guys stuck idiots fox education systems whole lot bullshit. people come where. know posted demonstration purposes, please... please ever again...

Nearly stroke reading that. No, wouldn’t, least major way. Singapore hotter higher UV index. virus spread well everywhere else.

The reasons summer lower virus transmission people stay homes day, outside home, usually things outside. Misinformation everyone everywhere start Fair enough, community epidemic community spread community best them. community specifically experiencing I'm comfortable returning school. pediatricians focusing younger children, pre middle school, seem get infected spread virus much, also know bad kids get education socialization. saying general people opening schools saying need listen scientists MDs doctors recommend something goes feelings ignore that. 
I'm middle I'm parent also older relatives I'm listening experts one.
If simplified things bit brevity seems progressives pissed conservatives disregard elderly sick progressives disregarding important factors kids. great equalizer though parent. met parent get says need keep schools closed. never said fortunately. father law hates Trump. explain voting Voldemort DeSantis hlped Trump avail. makes it, think he's voting Biden. Seriously. It’s bizarre there’s hey nothing going get back mentality. Yeah know , people get back work come on, kids choice they’re either sent unsafe conditions simply based what’s better economically vs healthy. Ugh.  Gilead already gave license many companies produce generics, it’s hard drug make there’s going natural bottleneck That's Latin name Unless prevent people forming personal relationships, capitalism always become crony capitalism. Rich people want laws protect/increase profits seek befriend/pay/cajole lawmakers change laws capitalists benefit. capitalist, regulations profit arent rules followed. They're obstacles destroyed worked around.

If cheaper dump chemicals river properly dispose them, stop laws stop gone. I'll make lobbying group talk lawmakers, I'll bribe regulators, maybe even get job regulator myself. mean, may friends guy appointing. not, always throw big extravagant party become friends them.

If dont it, someone else will, reducing costs, outcompeted market go business. really concerned sending son back school. begin freshman year. know wants go active sports loves school. want risk life. virus random one get mild symptoms yet another dead two weeks. immunity issues. Mainly allergies. Takes monthly injection since 9. live MO OK last week reported first teenage death (13) hits close home. hate hold back called normal routine also want get sick get family sick. Anyone else anxiety coping bc I'm ideas stay relaxed. really important? like high schoolers wearing mask social distancing anyway? Prob seeing 200+/day point week Thank saving time. can’t people get vaccine booster shots again? Albany 2 percent positive last checked cases keep rising. Schools reopen, end August SUNY Albany open doors take back students country. I’m betting man least things get worse get better Woah, almost like care age! Check what’s happening Portland. Unlawful detainment, unmarked vans, crazy authoritarian government sh\*t.

thank patriot act. simple God damn Google search gives 5 sources say otherwise. significant spikes cases due protests now? 6 months ago? Next week might brutal. Maybe see 200 deaths day. Trump caught would start blaming everyone else around claim one taking seriously one else fucking batshit insane base *would eat up*. 

Just like couple times decided take seriously day two switching gears again. would sanction maybe even bomb would get change good!

As Russian know ""love people, hate government"" rhetoric hypocritical high horse bullshit. It’s difficult win argument intelligent person. It’s impossible win argument brain dead moron. That’s *big* gamble. 

If many people cannot pay medical bills, becomes insurance company’s/hospital’s problem, patients’. system collapse.

Frankly I’m disappointed we’re conversation universal healthcare result this. mother severe bacterial meningitis. 

I sorry hear yes, I'm well aware damage cause. 

You really sound like actually aware severe braindamage meningitis cause. getting meningitis infection near zero. 

The chance getting brain infection near zero humans highly evolved organisms highly evolved immunity systems DNA already know virus bacteria generally encounter. cases confirmed meningitis related Covid-19, insignificant even start speculating yet.

You complete sociopath.  experience appears opposite mine. absences excused school long parent calls says kid sick, literally way make easier kids retake test. absent, matter reason, take test next time come in. even student say ready take test absent (unexcused) two days admin said let take next day. Big surprise, two unexcused absences finally took test week scheduled, delay handing back graded test students.
It literally possible make missing exam less inconvenient students inconvenient teachers. 

Kids still come school sick. asked someone thinks hoax. told videos hospitals etc, show adults children.  Therefore.....children get it. 

The logic process people mind-blowing me. Imagine mad celebrity actually something good change. Maybe next year we'll make america great again. Online schooling wasn’t failure us right outside Boston. 
This spring wasn’t much online learning crisis learning.
By fall, they’ll six months plan actual online/remote learning.
In Boston there’s lot poverty lack devices internet barriers learning. district provided devices need them.
There time right safely.
I don’t envy people making decisions end day safety come first.
I work high school tell it’s really possible building return safely without extraordinary measures district could afford. husband teacher kindergartener. I’m terrified upcoming school year. live NJ guess good thing since Murphy pretty aggressive response even hybrid thing half days kid’s, husband still 5 days week. autoimmune disease son husband asthma I’m freaking out. don’t want school time heart breaking kid misses playing kids much. He’s kid cousin year younger lives hour away. can't wait move next October

Colorado full. hear Kansas nice! earned masters online top 10 b school. disagree reduced value argument proposing. It’s brand, degree says exact thing on-campus students. brand lead significant increase ROI paid cost degree two years.

Again one forced go. don’t like price, go somewhere else take year off. I’m sure it’s top school, fill spot someone else. all, recent undergrads finding jobs, graduate professional school enrollment exploding. ""When think vacation... Missouri first place pops mind.""

- one agree 100%. lack response federal level is. Hah, imposter. Frozen fruit desserts new. 

Meet [the Oh yeah mean tell truth like China USA, right? /s responsible Jumping straight insults since incapable providing evidence opinions? righties alike, jump straight insults since lack cognitive ability formulate coherent going fracture mind permanently get help now.

Like folks Midterms? Oh wait... say they're skipped claim. does, please point Well seen signs well viruses cause cancer. list several sexually transmitted diseases viruses. like public health announcement. So...im thinking realm possibility definitely ‘precondition.’ Man idk may go bankrupt £2.50 parking fee deniers Canada much ""vivid real"" ""it's serious everyone's reacting"". dunno, ways almost worse. 

What really pissing ones claiming every death recorded covid death even hit bus died brain injury, simply *is true*. even little bit. 

Here AB I'm quite certain provinces well, chief medical officer publicly noted cases deemed unrelated initially assumed covid related updated numbers reflect that. super transparent stuff. 

They're recording everything covid, they're even recording everything obvious cause covid calling day. time death recorded covid investigation ensure was, fact, covid-19 covid-19 complications caused death. criteria basically, would person died contract covid? Like Democrats haven’t run every major city straight ground 60 years... it’ll years look data say X number people died going hospital previously would’ve. Take money back knowledge make rich less money? no. Kansas city would agreed earlier seems like China willing whatever takes stop cases rising, they’re aut0cratic government tools arsenal nation didn’t know anything real history America base .

False. Remember already spreading west coast. fact, one first big outbreaks nursing home Washington State. knew well NY got bad really bad thing get nursing homes. 

This article February

 

The first cases US detected January 17th. New York schools cancelled March 16th. laughed hard.

I hoping poster forgot /s somewhere. guys think USA like next year? I’m worried cultists going react actual reality Trump office. They’ll still less visible, well, unless die virus guess. have. still believe it. obvious see read article says humans (aged 0-9) transmit differently humans. Academic setback unnecessary preventable grief trauma ever spent time studied conflict zones? have. relatively short amount time people stop hiding bombs bullets, simply try go back normal lives. Humans creatures habit, deviation routine causes significant mental anguish. simply what's happening here. public health, international security expert worth salt could predicted this. quick decisive asking public sacrifice routine. failed country. accept matter do, eventually get infected. inevitable. changing trucks job, one gets paid ppl put masks. Economy demands blood else would unhappy leave - Texas Governor, probably. prolly meant leave part country general concept saving. Considering amount money spent banks/corporations wallstreet 10x higher spent actual people. one tourists lol. Except I'm New York State whole family cautious wear masks everywhere. Church st. great atmosphere though. reminded Ithaca NY reported still happen. kind hard understand virus behaves we've changed behaviors much last months. completely understand whole “parent complain” thing. send kid bump nurse end side-eyeing rest year. don’t send kid parent raise Hell go head principal. incapable seeing truth
 mental disease. Go seek help.

November going fracture mind permanently get help now. easily pop Tylenol reduce fever.  Yeah remember thinking summer slowing things down, I'm definitely gonna wait sending kids back school need see resurgence like first blindly exposing kids it. mom teacher, course many friends teachers, want go back teaching person. think 100% worth risk. afford bills obligations, spending $3k stimulus intended. Injecting money economy. 

Again, afford bills. feel like Vermont different country. Vermont basically Denmark. Public schools don’t take infants toddlers. matters scale. UFC easy go manage 1-200 fighters coaches, event staff per event, production facility / arena / bunker Vegas, Emirate government built another one international fighters cant get States. need manage one secure location week, dozen people, compared major sports manage thousands people months end require massively space infrastructure. insert [this episode badly written] galaxy quest gif Seems missed states.  Xinjiang politically unstable, though, government would tread LOT carefully. Yeah OK, guess Brussels fault pleb spending $600+ per week? need budget. horror stories people refused medical help stuck foreign countries unable leave hotels. may end killing child family member spreading disease. I’ve always told people doesn’t work long term. Like yeah it’s fair expectation expect keep distance strangers absolutely. I’ll fight pandemic. keeping distance friends family? People NEVER going blame that! It’s human nature. need held, cuddle, hug care about! 

And whilst millennials subreddit sit working home office jobs, likely married kids important people lives one household bubble don’t need worry social distancing. Young people stuck families often don’t get along important people lives mostly friends. trawl McDonald’s everyday customers screaming Cos got one last chicken nugget order I’m gonna go see mates cuddle girlfriend. Lord knows shifts need it. 

The sex thing another example. You’re asking single people give basic human instinct need least entire year? never gonna work months. people wearing masks say constitution freedom related argument. numbers faked? give awards bc gov decidedly shut down, test report, besides public coroners??? Cmon people start thinking problem!!!!!! political problem, everyone knows, it’s blatantly obvious, press groups want trump out. trust side!!! Well worked it. Nurses leaking information deaths old people death houses. even trying help them. still dinner movie! Keeps party going little! 

That said I’m saving sooo much money summer phish tour lol.....next year gonna wild Maybe next month they'll start self flagellating streets. find every reason convince people safer is. Even true number gonna different. government saying publicly ignites conspiracies gullible. gets half population like America isn’t bad thought get back work. Well let get bad. wish U.S. point could even consider bad second wave would be. o.O take atorvastatin. interesting part doctor offer Tricor month ago detected high cholesterol. went atorvastatin friends taking “safe”. perhaps reconsider that.

Yeah that's one take. 

I even high cholesterol doctor said every adult taking low dose cholesterol medicine do. 

Maybe get switch up. Here's [a current phylogenetic SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We've known since late February clades dominate European epidemics include several mutations original Chinese genomes, US East Coast epidemic derived European ones, various genetic clades continued diverge.

When longer SARS-CoV-2? Viral taxonomy fairly arbitrary, viral genera two viruses 10% genetically distinct considered species, others criteria 30%... would long term illness potential death affect family financially? virus people hospital months worth bills end it.  “young people vote Democrat”. Pretty much *entire state Rhode Island* votes Democrat — every sane person last Presidential election #anyonebuttrump information changing daily basis. Younger people could carriers mobility drive factors considered corrupt country possible. disgrace become. Abstinence never works. know people thought social distancing basically thing good idea. makes things worse gets people killed. Instead mandated hazmat suits made free part insurance. government would spend $200 per person instead $600 per week per person. That's happened. German politics slept issue well March, thanks early wide-scale testing contact tracing health departments able get handle outbreaks get-go. Added pure luck explosive untraced outbreaks like Northern Italy Madrid happen even best testing. 

But least initial confusion politics got act together actually listened science. I'm also happy open early stuck mask mandate even though business associations lobbied it. 13979 official deaths. 0,05% death rate. People downplaying Covid field day claiming flu.

Edit: mention part ofcourse: 
 Even today, Iranian death tolls remain based died coronavirus wards hospitals. However, it’s believed many died home, families reportedly asked doctors mention loved ones died virus avoid stigma associated COVID-19, illness caused virus. Curiously, causes death? horrible side effects studies actually shown increased  fuck would election day holiday? govt want people vote? I've seasonal allergy cough time time, really care France live XD Yeah, Spain weeks now. inside shops etc. everywhere apart beaches, swimming pools eating drinking. area also banned masks exit valves. tuber living undergroud, also agree. Also hi neighbor. That's I've saying beginning. people ever showcased celebrities mild symptoms people recovered. leads false sense security among ignorant masses. Much like front line reporting changed opinions Vietnam war, people need see what's actually happening. need see ICUs freezer truck morgues. aware, talking though, meant group people Same. take atorvastatin. interesting part doctor offer Tricor month ago detected high cholesterol. went atorvastatin friends taking “safe”. perhaps reconsider that.

Edit: Sorry. checked message said Crestor Tricor. know it’s quite different I’m new high cholesterol thought Tricor. bad. chose Lipidor said friends taking years. anti-vaxxer still use masks Europe. last day public back March crowd high school kids swarmed Chipotle. talking virus anything prevent spread. coach shows goes table table telling virus kill them. left disgusted left home since. Many hospitals disposable blood pressure cuffs. sure it’s reached blood clinics. 

I would ask Probably better HBA1Cs. going pay bills support family dead? going teach next generation kids dead?

Please know options look. may pretty, owe family survive. 

I would also encourage family look teaching abroad. conditions much better. teacher friends happy discuss anyone looking option including visas etc. Haha, also idiots too. Ok, clinical trials still there. percent death risk COVID 0,1% collateral damage vaccine, would still get vaccine. Good! Apparently, medical malpractice. all, newspapers spoke said GPs, said isn't! pardon taking word matter unsourced ones anonymous person Internet. 😔 thought editorializing via title would removed? Resign. needs resign. According Reuters 


To rest world

Indonesia part Southeast Asia. Vermont slaps Yeah makes things wet men goatees sunglasses? think they’re ones making “truth COVID-19” videos. spread easily =/= spread all. 

Plus babies particularly mobile. Realistically probably caught adult. That's studies done PCR antibody tests seem imply. cell studies coming might change. two pre-prints I've seen far imply although household contacts seroconvert, still possess sars-cov2 specific cells. implies exposed virus might kind immunity. one scale 1 Hiroshima now.  **Meningitis** is **acute inflammation** protective membranes covering brain spinal cord.

It caused bacteria, virus (and several types fungus). 

**Meningitis** cause severe braindamage depending severity **inflammation**. 

Please get facts straight. 

All doctors similar professions **knew** already, (and studies already exists meningitis caused sars1 btw.) **All** doctors world, knew, infection result meningitis braindamage. us would like thing. right would bet anything improving. likely civil war right improve things citizens. never heard vaccines terrible side effects majority population. links? silicone instead fabric means hotter wearer. produce way sweat condensation inside mask.

Imagine concept socks, put tight silicone socks instead fabric. would wetsuit. Covid denial lot common rape denial. Don’t admit bad happening others, admit bad thing happen too. 

I’ve known lot older women would blame young girl getting butt pinched, saucy went alone, happened fault. Shame blame victim real. I’ve talked bunch people don’t believe numbers. think people dying things government lying grossly inflating number Covid deaths. tell think it’s way around, there’s lot people dying Covid pandemic related causes, official numbers deflated... blinking, head shaking, clicks. lot people won’t hear don’t want hear. lot university classes headed online people complain that’s shouldn’t cost much instruction. Unlike k-12 one forcing go... law wouldn’t pass. Nearly $16k ""60% discount"" lol

Did stay hospital though? Dates service lists 5 days. Study: little people people too. AAP backtracked position states schools hot spot zones reopen. specialize anything? could always create fun online course, either YouTube Skillshare. insulting anyone tell people stop treating schools like responsible solve major societal problems funds, resources, power fix. insulting anyone teachers upset society insists dumping problems schools gets blames teachers never power resources fix them. Apparently can't expect understanding lot people much older either. mean... ever doubt this?

Did people actually believe virus less transmissible host younger? would even work? depends live. Going ER significantly faster truly rural areas. already knew 1918  Sad fact worked large H.MO., could quite bit sick time. also got 5 personal days. sounds great 1. can't use personal days conjunction days like vacation. 2. approved 2 weeks advance,3 never approved team members vacation then.4. use certain time blocks too. NEVER December 10th. Screw birthday actually December. 5 . lose end year get paid 50% them. So. People use sick time things really need personal time stupidity. one dies work either sick. come back mess. Yeah, smaller size make wet, uncomfortable mess. much silicone touching face, trying anything produce much sweat filters sponges. next sentence cited paper conveniently omitted: ""Other potential effectors cyto-toxic CD8+ lymphocytes may limit spread infectious agents recognizing killing infected cells.""

Humoral immunity important yes. means mechanism body uses fight infection. fact sometimes using antibodies instead cell mediated response causes worse disease (lepromatous vs tuberculoid leprosy example). 

With SARS-CoV-2 know immunity look like. please stop propogating idea diminishing antibody titers 2-3 months means immunity impossible. immune system complex that, exactly specific information means pandemic remains seen. agree probable mode action dilemma. 

The distinction viral damage immune response damage strict explained layperson media, otherwise Tocilizumab antimmune properties could shown better effects.

Nevertheless, even Remdesivir ventilated patients ""only"" reduces length ICU stay, that's opening important ressources strained systens. also mostly given part smaller studies deliver new data, least hospital, ventilated patients left meaningful numbers. Well yes....but ~~freedom selfish prick~~ claustrophobia, anxiety, breathing ""condition"". assume that's case default now. usually is. wish sarcastic. obvious since April national response happening.  stores required masks locally like done nationally gave shit. Oh ok BLM protests totally fine? Got it! 2020; sequel. ah see may offset effect oblivious energetic child  others stated combination younger age, reduced mortality, better treatments, increased testing capacity. 

We actually hitting hospitalization peak April, we’re probably pretty darn identical terms actual infections right vs April put 2 important notes first post. One lock especially careful. haven’t even grocery shopping family seen parents 3 months long time.

Also, funny enough since mention drinking bars, said don’t mean hanging simply mean around family.

Yes Zoom meeting grandma grandpa asked don’t see daughter. Apparently it’s kind difficult keep toddler behind screen longer 3 minutes :)

All saying around people something that’s genes. whole evolution around people. able see family, hug etc innate us human beings.

I lock 3 months wife saw nobody, sometimes calls .. sometimes zoom. thank god 1960 definitely able speak friends family way. it’s real thing :)

I don’t disagree you. also don’t disagree lockdown. need keep vulnerable fellow humans safe. social social creature hard. 

Also... opening also weird. It’s weird “afraid” walk around outside avoiding people. really mental damage lock method. treat motherfuckers. Let rot hell. Mormons twice already. See well worked? /s “God helps help themselves.” spend several hours close-talking loudly loud nightclub? change. Agreed know using context clues hard, definitely skill want develop.

Context clues?

[Like posting /r/LosAngeles asking buying posting posting discussing marathon Los Angeles (again - know pal; sure really good reading context clues giving advice?

If context clues led believe guy Maine, sure post lot Los Angeles - think?

I sincerely hope comment helps you!

Sincerely,    
Richard Nixon mild allergies. Wearing mask irritates somewhat, tend cough sneeze. maybe notice more, since cannot wipe nose self-conscious coughing sneezing public.

I still wore mask required. idea supposed mean. know..   Also lot young reckless people give shit catching  think right money . Great post !!!
Seems like maybe virus changed ever reason causing near many cytokine storm events ..its also requiring many ventilators . perfect world, government would continue assistance protections parents could stay home children without worrying rent food. Everyone lives one goes jail sort safety net. There's propaganda push open schools back act daycare, employers demand staff get back work. One, dick. Telling people ""you reason people dying"" may accurate way, come dick. Two, sports practice discouraged (assuming American Football). Outdoor transmission way harder inside sports healthy. Three, 10% nation gotten assume caught 1/10 cases. people gotten it. Everybody anecdote. That's studies conducted. pretty pathetic life rooting virus someone try tell humanity ending virus.

That laugher. Yeah I’m going straight that’s X factor look like need booster shots actually concerning

Edit: don’t facts saying need booster shots btw Fauci threw idea I’m pretty inclined lean way  never changes sometimes human stupid thing dies human longer thing.

Unfortunately coronavirus discriminate. Many deaths intelligent people. Immortan Ron? Witness me.  hope get better soon .. they're likely bar, giving fuck. problem one silicone tight face. I've worn share masks work, amount material face hot fuck, pool sweat water inside moving wearing it. filters sponges. Nobody summer Proves can't fix stupid. agree statement totally, want explain described ""But least initial confusion politics got act together actually listened science. I'm also happy open early stuck mask mandate even though business associations lobbied it."" closely linked Mr. Braun. happened behind curtain MoI Braun's office could bring MPs line due Merkel's direct representative German lockdown measures coordinated less him. MoH less picture. far judge media reports last month. clear even person picture didn’t mask on. people don’t read, picture gives bad example. Epidermis cancer  know, understand Accula does. OP say qPCR. need qPCR qPCR fundamentally better terms sensitivity/specificity/LOD, etc; fundamentally provide reliable result terms true/false positive/negative tolerant interfering substances, etc. simply involves complex set steps data collection (and interestingly enough, Accula surprisingly low limit detection compared qPCR tests currently available). 

That's true, current mass testing process many samples concurrently, mean time result patient better depends general circumstances (like mentioned, POC wants something fast tolerate one-by-one operation decision moment depends result larger-scale testing technically holding much anything, anyway). Plus huge backlog tests many areas means long lag times confirmation.

Regarding quantitative aspect qPCR, far I'm aware (I currently work area) one covid-19 mass testing options moment, terms reporting number copies measuring viral load etc., largely collection method subject lots variation collected target material interfering substances (like blood, things patient may eaten recently); results provided simply positive/negative inconclusive. Generally one would something like cell culture get viral load. qPCR tests, threshold calls (positive, negative, inconclusive) set based sensitivity specificity (and possibly parameters) results development, clinicians workers delivering results generally provided level data review see something like copy count (mainly would info anyway?). main thing anyone develops test (currently) cares whether achieve true-positive true-negative result least amount input sample possible best sensitivity. DNA quantitation part user report. shit. fuck they? There's basically nothing open except retail stores office buildings. Gotta pay dem Bill's yo... I'm glad happened election year. imagine deal years? US might well collapse. cares. wonder cases like make people decide refuse testing, even sick suspect Covid. respect need isolate people test positive house arrest ankle monitors? actually engineer ten years last year switched teaching (because I'm apparently insane). nerd real world applications lot. fuckin planet people, originally, think couldn’t? actually tried recently, love it! dad, however, won’t even try “imposters.” Haha Yup. flu shot (ever), get COVID vaccine. yeah factoring booster shots? Normalcy might take bit longer it’s one shot per person. Last heard researchers still unsure people would need supplemental doses ensure Covid antibodies hand around long enough allow individual get infected.  shit, Sherlock. americans really need study know kids teenagers spread virus too? can't imagine must feel like confident government know dealing with, guy responding posted Antifa militant arm zionism since 1930, know fuck anything, tactics behavior always same. shit germany WW2. actually lined streets machine guns shot anyone fit communist bill, thus response national pro fascism, pro trump. right nation nations resources. belongs us, people. Fuck everyone dislikes it. Fuck anyone thinks get away rioting guise ""protesting"" Fuck anarchists communists, deserve death. Yes! Instead trying replicate in-person instruction, schools could embrace new options online school allows. Florida man gotta say I'm glad quite bit base far. Upvoted.

Because I'd rather read /s.

tHaN rEaD wHAtEvER HeCK Is. We've definitely gotten little complacent Burlington. work Church St. noticed thing. Though say waaaay many tourists, lot worse masks complying contact tracing. memory cells important part building immunity? mean, strictly accurate, nominal numbers matters since hospital beds counts relative. says believe it. many survived? Well....Obviously. 

Instead, it’s killing 1% population, people either unaware effects it, (like myself) don’t know anyone who’s affected it.

I’ve lucky live area gone relatively unscathed virus (partly due little isolated, partly due fact social distancing/mask rules followed enforced public large). I’ve made sure I’ve wearing mask, case everywhere go city people careful.

So (in way) understand idiots thinking “this hoax” “this isn’t dangerous”....because you’re affected directly, don’t know anyone seriously ill/died - feel bulletproof. feels world away you.

That said knew exactly felt sick it, you’d take precautions sure. Technically water makes things wet. :) water isn’t wet make things wet states.

Not approach seem immoral also seems illogical. Chinese think Beijing outbreak caused imported salmon IIRC stopped importing seafood Ecuador finding virus packaging shrimps.  know don’t answers. I’m assuming best, hybrid model kids go every day. 10 kids room usually fits 20 more. Kids staff wear masks. Gym auditoriums cancelled, used spread things out. Maybe use cafeterias well make sure meals eaten desk.

And sorry I’d communities low positivity rates case counts. NY using 5 percent positivity threshold that’s probably bit high. Northeast would shot try this, opinion opening hot spots madness.

I also think parents option keep kids home penalty. Hybrid works request. 

Teachers staff risk. sure would teacher going in, I’d masked probably use money UV lights air purifiers.  Fuck watch Biden speech. He’s fine. Stop getting opinions deceptively edited twitter videos.

edit: crawl fear hole, downvote comment, crawl back fear hole. Sure would great people read article headline. researchers found children middle high school likely infect others Children younger 10 years old around half likely adults spread Yes, but: Researchers traced children felt sick. transmission rates asymptomatic cases remains unknown, children less likely adults develop symptoms.  sub startrek references? Look top videos today. isn’t back work. It’s giving shit anymore...which don’t blame young people for. Fauci said, young people naturally risk taking know consequences aren’t extreme them. I’m trying rude it’s pretty common sense here. Trying blame going back work specious best. Sure it’s % it’s actions without much consequences seems driving this.

Yes. It’s obvious. discrimination housing Central Park five issues “very fine people” sharing video guy shouting “white power” it’s pretty obvious. Probably. police departments near announced going enforce COVID violations even businesses let alone private parties. comfort food, food much relationship, that's hard swap. Nevertheless, sometimes sacrifice things enjoy. others :) watched video 4 year old hospital. healthy kid.

The notion younger safe completely false. people get hospitalized, we're even begining know long term adverse health complications are.

And we're learning they're serious issues asymptomatic ""mild"" cases well. Causing damage heart even brain.

With rate infection United States desperately need shut down, else face far worse situation. Ive operating assumption single case evidence enough right now. far done us good. Always within month two, single case stufies become new standards. continue: are, definition, close domestic care older person, thus unable socially distance vulnerable populations returning home. parents take care grandparents go work stores. keep-the-god-damn-kids-home. type ""Snapmap"" Google it'll take is, stories spread wide.

Depending city, dozens hundreds times people simply ignoring pandemic. Protests highly visible, restaurants, bars, churches, house parties not.  well stayed 4 months home think might currently ventilator somewhere. read stories connected bottom. I’m profoundly sad. couple things: reinfection reemergence still important distinguish between. Also, even true reinfection, seem common. seems uncommon recent papers seem pointing isolated individual cases happening.

Sometimes, viruses weird. bad viral infection, got better week, got hammered even worse week recovering. symptoms, higher fever. sucked doctor basically confirmed sometimes don’t kick virus. Obviously likely reemergence reinfection, timeframe wasn’t extreme. Still, it’s undoubtedly something rational person spend time worrying about. subreddit careful use isolated cases develop confirmation bias subject. could fluke. Wow people NYC dumb. wish hospital administrators would begin honest outspoken what’s going on, don’t dichotomy “everything’s great infinite surge capacity” public-facing websites, “oh god we’re drowning” samizdat coming individual doctors.

If things bad, hospitals need stop covering up, make sure people know. That’s way we’re going make public health changes. criminal. Climate change big one. treated anti-science religious hysteria facebook conspiracy theories covid-19. everything quite back normal.

I can't speak countries Europe, UK still plenty measures place. anyone work home so, social distancing still advised, gatherings limited. Even though pubs open, numbers limited tables spaced out. Nightclubs still closed opening date planned yet. Gyms, theatres, swimming pools reopen.

So chances actually close conditions someone infected dramatically lower lockdown. got make distinction though..

You may idiot, _fucking_ idiot.

One stupid, stupid inside another being. Shit, steak tartare vaccine. Trump racist? asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

Oh, gonna learn boy, gonna learn time. Correct Doctors, nurses, public transport drivers, supermarket staff - people go work even first signs slight tickle throats capitalism feel society would suffer even one extra day not. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  Ice Wall Airlines? hear pretty nice ticket fare days. /s Yeah there's cab driver believed infected American troops ~2 days military personnel arrive Japan commercial flights take PCR tests. fly directly one bases country showing symptoms COVID-19 required to, according Foreign Ministry official. Canada-circlejerk finally peaked? Scandinavian State numbers lie CDC caught last week trustworthy. real leader leads. /s Nice help concentrate infections like that. would think optimism supposed vaccine coming soon contribute this. find data convincing all.... reading post history, doubled assessment. New York city outbreak experts US estimated 240-400k deaths USA alone.
Couldn't believe back 140k sadly might become true many open cases quite high death rate compared many countries 

Here austria probably get back necessity wear masks going stores tomorrow. (Active cases went 350 lockdown may 1350 again. Travelling within europe mostly allowed again). Beside changing minds every days things right overall march on. Hmm, that's correct argument. Even 20 percent India 60, that's roughly 270 million people right? 

You right, citizens governments need pressurized ensure follow rules ensure rules followed respectively. Needs teacher. IMO way people don’t take seriously now, would actually take seriously death rate much higher. unlucky remember point sick, starving kids, verge losing job deciding going work option left. Unfortunately everyone remembers this. That’s continue insult unfortunate people anyway. I'm hopeful major companies like Walmart Target requiring masks, eventually noisy antimaskers stfu needs doing. yet found time recently give millions 9/11 memorial... country burning. It’s kids die ER it’s adults seniors forced contact asymptomatic carriers get die. 

Being irresponsible children turns vectors killing others. entered medical field CNA January, thinking maybe I’d work towards nursing. I’m desperately looking get fuck field see expendable healthcare workers are. make better? o.O Yes Seems bit extreme definitely deter people getting tested Germany China Europe basically (regarding technological capabilities). daycare age either, distinctly remember going school like 9th grade flu missed classes would missed something else wanted weeks later. 

I young naive even think going get sick. parents clearly care time. central florida. wont going them.   outlook part problem. help *me*, directly, relatively small percent -so wear one? others around thinking thing mean protecting either, a/pre-symptomatic spreading definitely thing. Giving least minimal shit around taking part functioning society. Imagine two apartment blocks. One sprinkler system installed, fire department on-call. not.

Fires start apartments. Apartment nothing, fire consumes entire apartment. Apartment B automatically starts sprinklers moment gets whiff smoke, fire department called shortly afterwards. 

An onlooker scratches head says, “I don’t believe Apartment B burnt toast. would big reaction, Apartment burnt down, reaction?” vulnerable patients, definition, already nursing homes, unless they're already hospital.

If nothing solution, states nothing would great shape now. not.

This nursing home talking point stupid naked. first weeks handled badly, nineteenth time thread, repeat article, Fauci's comments, initial impact later evolving response strategies management reopening, (so far) looks like NY well. Well no, right thing all. Guess fucking idiot, every single person wearing mask would much safer! you’re wrong part problem. everyone wearing mask, could substantially protect us COVID. think meant bet beans. Issues stupid could cause rift within party. better, that's implosion going. Aw, well thank you. trying virtue signal, think cause huge nursing shortage near future. dead set nursing, people drop pretty early anyway.

Stay safe, friend!   Ohh fuuuck, remote small health network areas world scare most. Alaska one places. going slow burning forest fire there.  Good luck assume everyone it, including you.  already saw notification typed comment username deleted it.

where deleted comment then? idiot need vaccine. never developed one 1918 flu. (1918 twenty years term ""virus"" came common use, we'd developed handful manmade vaccines point). 

These things burn out, eventually, process pleasant. get back ten million gave Dr Phil ? KNEW months ago. overwhelming amount information show mask usage would almost certainly help. 

Instead leaning information US government &amp; media (both parties) lied public.  dumb reasoning conservatives masks trap viruses, ppl touch to, say, remove masks much likely spread others...dumb fucks Another distraction. Governance 'on track'. never understood need follow cling someone desperately. love mom dad dammit ever disagree argue. Yet follower swallowing nuts guy give two shits them. think fact men sexually active longer enough explanation. quite specific function whereas even historically women likely bring family. yeah, see deleted comment, know said bs. don’t give damn fetuses either, it’s super easy manipulation point strong block single-issue voters. armed would probably enough, police numbered outgunned.

To stay peaceful, plywood protest phalanx Yeah, traded constant ambulances constant police helicopters neighborhood. I'm sure need go cuddle blanket hide reality. douche. pass, .01% also needs cut. thinks convenience important public health.

She absolutely needs ankle bracelet, instant wants anything, going door shops. also taking daily dosage Clorox? Yeah, really mean anyway? symptoms, really validates beliefs. would undermine stance near death ventilator, not. Yeah agree you. sure got comment let people die. adding said, trying illustrate can’t approach problem exactly way countries did. absolutely shut down, adds part 2 govt take care people. absence that, you’re going people don’t money coming openly rebelling. That’s like 3 x 9/11s worth deaths couple weeks. Almost like American problem, prevalent everywhere. 

Who'da thunk?  definitely living strange times. scares get way worse gets better. Yep. want effective revolution sanity, efficiency, &amp; kindness get reign country. rural, low population density even cities, high voluntary mask usage, highly educated, high focus healthcare access, least-religious state country. Corona never stood chance. Keep Vermont! link studies? Also determine it’s permenant lung damage short time frame? Surely would hard tell thing lungs haven’t time heal? far I’ve saw it’s small percentage left difficulties. LA half population NYC, spread *three times* area. visualize streets people live city, add car culture vs universal transit. think two US cities less alike people live close together, far apart.

And strains we're dealing came Europe, means overwhelmingly entered via NYC. paywall site. peak 881 mid-April. That's really good.

We (Northern Ireland) well too. 8 patients hospital, 1 ICU. That's peak 346 mid-April well. Mask casket. Don’t things though? STOP FUCK!!!  21st birthday want go bar. course. That's tradition someone age need choose.
The grown-ups closed bar already.

(Sorry, know 21 year olds think 21 grown up, rest us there, know really not).
Just legally all. love though. Everything medical science community seeing virus points body losing immunity 3 months beating infection.


Care back credible references? Given outbreak quite bit older 3 months, we'd lot confirmed cases already especially among HCWs. (Especially given immunity disappear fades, gone 3 months average, lot people would vulnerable then).

For reference, SARs MERS immunity estimated last *at least* 1-2 years. Sounds fake forget, minorities can't racist toward whites, impossible /s state government city government NYC fucking terrible. Fuck ass wagon! literally comparing highest recorded day lowest recorded day since then? rolling averages? fuck wrong people?

Us people literally looking pertinent FHM people looking confirmed cases, you? know anything Sweden's testing rates past five months know Sweden little testing recently useless proxy. need look deaths ICU admittance. 

What data? Thank good human. feel we're seeing disproportionate damage future current under-40 crowd, agree damage hits every generation alive, one escape unless tremendously wealthy. learned New York people would dead... thought Maryland well Hogan? Ignorance bliss though, right? 21 vaccine candidates different diseases 13 clinical trials, actually fucking stupid say something stupid, automatically removed office. Time tell. people masks rural areas hotspots major cities. connected media might believe. Best running along now. I’m sure need iron kkk hood. Psychoooo.  kook  literally problem. I'm mostly talking part timers states share. retirees flee fl winter. back north gets hot kind older article it.

Edit:. trying come anti ny pro fl. think anyone really winning corona battle know still first quarter it. really like applauding something far over. know two months ago numbers area low tests rarely available, easy get access testing. time lot testing shenanigans shortfalls area. please definite ""purely political post"" seems comments would fit description including parent comment removed comment. Ah yea, global issue though: business owners may get compensation keep people employed, renters country left right continue pay rent. there's temporary moratorium evictions.

Evictions business closures seen everywhere, though admittedly probably nowhere near hard US (in first world, Latin America's fucked even harder imo) Sigh... yes is... Worst part get sick much proclaim media COVID-19 bad people said be....... Second Italy, Thailand lockdown mask up. broke heck too. Enemy America. invest education, govt afraid people people govt. Wait, people tearing 5G towers? I’ve never heard sadly believe it. sources? Hey, that’s looks like close well! No, correct. Also worth noting several labs Arizona report today joke? Based current CDC estimates mortality, numbers New York City alone consistent 40% city infected. rest country handles well, around million dead. I'm sure proud there. going disaster... Yeah didnt know either read article couple weeks ago. group Houston Doctors actually held press conference discredit media calm everyone down. let everyone know overwhelmed numbers misinterpreted. That's always try take media says grain salt tend hype everything instill fear people. reminder never let win anything power local dog catcher ever Romney seems like sympathetic alternative... entire pandemic made distrust nurses absurd degree. Every nurse secondary social circle downplayed situation. Meanwhile, one ER doctor know ended ventilator. That's true though. Studies China showed survivors, even asymptomatic survivors, COVID, quite commonly left permanent lung damage. data yet, indication also leaves lasting brain, kidney, heart damage. No, young people dying rate old are, mean fine. really lie. hospitals extremely low PPE Americans stocking masks states even seen single COVID case yet. quickly retracted masks became required right way NY. trusting instead? Lashing country loving 100%. really hard read people MERS died tested. Ikr several countries study almost 20 years ago different respiratory disease - Coronavirus less - believed them. wish mine smelt like wecome, gave back ""Thank "" You’re one haha, took minute realize actually said saw story insinuated visited Walmart without mask tested positive. validity that? Rest country quickly catching up...which shouldn’t New York ended getting control laid good blueprint stamp out.

States like Florida zero excuse. New York one first states caught guard incomplete knowledge. Florida caught guard full knowledge, leaders don’t care. Yea call even learn mistakes? Yeah never said China one, country wide, anything say trusted. know based clients Wuhan Beijing literally locked houses. People saying China got control better are, view, comparing apples oranges. Note: ***Please keep mind today highest Saturday case count ever.***

According Worldometer, Louisiana (read below), Rhode Island, Connecticut reported numbers today, 47 states Washington D.C. have.

Fortunately, deaths Nebraska, South Dakota, West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont today.

Also, labs Arizona report today according following source: (thank u/babydolleffie this)

Louisiana longer reporting numbers Saturdays release weekend numbers Sundays (source:  suddenly get going. thought one ""can't report numbers there!"" shits.   course did. contributed discourse made worse result. 

heres downvote Yeah, waterfront South Florida. Life's rough. Get used it- America going become heartless go deeper *cannibalization peasantry* phase empire.

You see justifications increasingly inhumane societal decisions. compassion, mercy, empathy eschewed support additional revenue streams profit- structural mechanism American empire. Diminishing returns complexity decreasing Energy Return Energy Investment make empire expensive, absent necessary gains avenues plunder world, next stage endo-colonization: process acquiring necessary plunder support empire within country instead outside conquered states.

The result empathy/compassion/mercy consumed, assholes shouting ""bootstwaps!!!"", decaying infrastructure, stagnating wages, increasingly hyper-socially-stratified availability goods, increasingly aggressive planned obsolescence, increasing focus numbers/metrics/algorithms/financial-fuckeries justify increasingly inhumane societal choices, vanishing civil liberties, increased militarization local/state/federal police, increased corporate financial system complexity serve mechanism moral laundering acquisition profits, hollowing political reality increasingly interact democratic republican politicians little blue red shamans dancing around totem poles ultimately shrines corporate financial gods, etc etc. Insert surprised Pikachu face here.

Exposure proportional time definition. much exposure leads infection unknown (or probability infection depending exposure exact).

I agree you, schools closed case numbers high CA. wouldn’t sent kids school year, I’m happy governor made choice me. cast things trailer step kids hate you? Sounds real nice. Texas situation much worse, either way kids spread virus older teachers puts risk think understand better then. suburbs different, high density spots hit pretty hard (well, pandemic stopped spread whole country there's huge differences suburbs). took peek ESPN NYY v NYM. fans, cardboard people stands piped crowd noise. 5 minutes, turned off.  really sucks, fucks going get best healthcare imaginable, single one succumb it, thousands thousands die complete disconnect society. Real society, upper echelons powerful. \*Surprised pikachu face\* New Yorker agree shit. Coronavirus sub hard Cuomo cause he’s delaying reopenings far long good shut-ins here. closed late also opening late.

He singlehandedly cause thousands business closures numerous extra deaths arrogance.

Fuck cuomo Let's hope ACA case gets dropped. well said. Revolution, come! Bullshit. 

We knew virus spread fast could spread fucking February. 

NY leaders still encouraging people go town middle March. 

They sent elderly nursing homes inadequate care ability left die. 

They fucking 10x death Texas dont give shit model. girlfriend started teaching new district told priority choice wants teach home new Wherever let work home there’s vaccine, I’m picky. I’m Iowa originally it’s certainly going state. Mass wanted open schools good spot so. keep forgetting exactly Q-anon folks exactly are. know they're dangerous hope there's lot them. Coronavirus: ""Trump 2020 baby! Oh yeahhhh!""  That’s point. regions flu virus recognized cells don’t mutate quickly. cells don’t protect catching flu even though recognize one strain. senators there? Oh yea. That's difference though. care ""freedoms."" Everyone else go take long walk short cliff care. It’s discount compared terrible coverage get go outside health system, still terrible. wife works bank carry insurance it’s 30% cheaper family plan, half deductible accepted systems area. medications never blocked insurance. Plus it’s 10% coinsurance instead 30% work offers (20% see health system doctors) thank you. say hate Trump. much invested situation you. people think corrupt, barely literate narcissist though. feel like didn’t quite read said correctly. completely agree you, argument OP. already idiot. Sad part Ohio really well back start this. One first states close schools, forefront lot shutdown measures, DeWine Acton pull punches daily press conferences.

It's gone shit since then. top there's one thing many people know (or forget) NYC schools. 40% students public schools get majority meals school breakfasts lunches. students' parents work jobs shutting down.

Closing schools day one would meant kids quite literally starved, parents 7 year olds would decide losing job watching kids home. Could prepped? Sure... probably, 20/20 hindsight gratuitous.

DeBlasio Cuomo screwed bad, lot rock/hard place going on.  truly case it’s pointless laws cops can’t stop crimes committed feel like I've heard plenty Oxford astrazeneca. [I'm New York City public school teacher 63 colleagues died coronavirus. happen

Maybe meth maybe def dead hooker. quick brush away. didn’t meth...I fucked mind went down. C’mon...I’m free thinking. almost seems like attempt eugenics definitely hitting voters. Honest question don’t know, would seen Pandemic coming? signs would be?  mean needs risk assessment prevalent virus community

The janitor get Covid getting groceries maybe option work protected job You’ll never home family. Lol. 9,000? vaccine trials 30,000? arbitrary numbers? already millions doses far showing safe stage 2 3. people trials? Instead 9,000 20,000? Instead 30,000 50,000? 


Would hassle handling additional test subjects relation number staff mostly? I'd think they'd love data case right? Right? Look summer’s sea ice melt. We’re within years first blue ocean event. There’s supposed plastic fish oceans 2050. 100-200 species going extinct every day. We’ve already lost 60% wildlife 1970 2014. Every week, news story pops saying “you know thing said wouldn’t happen 2100? It’s starting happen now.” know we’re within years decades really ugly resource wars food water. know humanity’s “best case” scenario ecologically impoverished world extreme human population bottleneck. know extinction event rivals Great Dying distinct possibility. face that, Covid’s blip radar. 

I sure shit don’t want get transmit virus, understand nihilism could drive somebody point wanting get tempt fate. sadly almost 1 3 tests positive currently 9026 new tests reported today 2742 testing positive today. far past 1 3 end backlog probably. voluntary, would help communities without large number conspiracy theorists (in CA lots sane towns). next Japan trip looks moving farther farther away. going California? Weren’t strict lockdown? 

Also, Iowa? Why? 

And lives Idaho? 

The South red shouldn’t surprise anyone. 

Everything bigger Texas. 

Who lives Oklahoma? 

For shame, Kansas. 

Utah, Arizona, Nevada even ashamed. 

I kid, obviously, y’all stay safe. governor unhappy people visiting Texas, Arizona, Florida failing quarantine/properly social distance/mask upon return. Wealth, yes. That's key everything, never attain it. Good grief, got millions people trying break middle class, getting rut too. That’s true misunderstanding use ventilators how. I’m critical care medicine physician. lot misinformation spread due Dunning-Kruger effect due busy overwhelmed hospital systems non-intensivists taking care ventilated patients coming wild untested ultimately unfounded hypotheses mechanical ventilation. I’m teacher get 10 year. don’t use end school year cash certain percentage days pay per unused sick day. I’ve always used kids little germ factories I’m immunocompromised.
I’m unlimited paid sick days think requiring doctors note reasonable people don’t take advantage. Yesterday much higher case count. hit 80k today didn't. ""mandatory"" like one public transport 30-40% doesn""t wear ?

Mandatory mean shit unless enforcement don""t see coming.

Thanks stupidity America (and Brazil). putting COVID patients nursing home doesn’t feel correct Lmao imagine stupid? go patting back literally retarded lol don’t. walking version Charlie It’s Always Sunny meme he’s losing mind mailroom. Thank interesting post!
Those non mask people really believe fighting

They understand indirect murderer protester hero anti-freedom, full conspiracy government. 

And brought bible! think god really angry possible murderer using excuse human saving obligation. Well average dead person, you’d start digging get closer. Every news headline: Man refused obvious thing shocked suffer repercussions said thing. vanishingly rare, though. could never beaten it, well.

Edit: There’s bunch comments asking know it’s vanishingly rare speculating extrapolating bunch numbers. *far* conjecture saying it’s vanishingly rare. Definitionally, 3 4 instances haven’t confirmed 15 million confirmed infections vanishingly rare. I’m saying never change, thus far, “they got twice” crowd one dicey speculation. surprisedpikachu.jpg Much that, PCR runs 45 cycles. that, PCR product still needs analyzed via method electrophoresis. even get name right dictatorship article saying “as 7th day Adventist would believe that. article link least actual quote saying doesn’t believe it. may follow religion doesn’t mean agree every single thing believe. Floridian, kudos Cuomo fuck ~~DeathSentence~~ DeSantis

edit: awww, must pissed maga off. Good It’s easy get work visa Canada work degreed professional like nurse engineer accountant whatnot.  Though like vaccine actually works? Make vaccine - works so, how, made specific chemicals, proteins, etc - made certain way specifically perhaps target say area body. Ie; definitely react body specific way, thus making body react specific way. Like human body right? Vaccine work specific human bodies, targets something pretty much people kind thing, definitely work broad way.

Therefore, definitely absolutely work, know doing, vaccine made specific proteins, chemicals, yeah definitely work, made right stuff. So, already understand put body since already understand body work. Like need see anything already know would probably happen.

Don't need light pile gunpowder see explosion able confer explosion size, perhaps already determine yeah obviously taking match gunpowder make react explode given much gunpowder such. need SEE already make good logical guess. Young children far less likely spread virus pubescent children adults. high school aged children, particular, spread virus like adults do. *shrug* New York says hi. seems think stock market translates votes truth New York best-timed shutdown. SC, honestly shut March April. nothing going on, also limited cases. full shut fatigued people gave false understanding. Now, need shut down, reluctant....it’s dumb, contextual fact often ignored. 

Hopefully, learn full shutdown foolish, government response targeted based around stronger testing tracing. title say “good” reasons? New York California.....I working LA protests thousands maskless people yelling shouting shoulder shoulder. find update ok? 9!9!9!

EDIT: Based much he's tweeting seems fine sane states. ...by continuing work home, letting handful diehard ""I've gotta office mask"" people contract COVID-19. think simplyfy to:

The opposition Sweden US dislikes Sweden's strategy. Trump (for while) liked Swedens strategy government following advice experts. Ayooooo I'm 22. Despite paying expenses, given stimulus check school spring 2019 filed dependent parents. I'm expected pay back 50k loans can't declare bankruptcy wanting chance decent life. Climate change getting closer closer existential threat. worked 2 ""essential"" jobs saw older generation say fuck flood target 2 weeks lockdowns. listen everyone older 40 family buy fascist fox news propaganda every gathering. point becomes hard care world try. equate correct frenzy towards COVID Sharknado, myself. Swirling tornadoes rights protestors Karens swirling cities, snapping anyone trying fix things Vermonters also breathing recycled air conditioned air. summers usually around 80°F retailers running A/C. Lobbylobbylobby. $$$

And, country club buddies could give fuck virus. It’s Bigfoots Boris failing understand covid19 interest trump thinks. Neighbors huge party last night least 100 people masks. Beer pong flip cup perfect way spreading it. Yeah right, still thing covid many deaths could prevented putting covid patients LTC facilities. remove deaths, would be? Hmm, don’t know maybe illnesses diseases people haven’t able get treated due coronavirus? haven’t able see GP since February.

Maybe increase drug crime deaths too. Theres many factors covid either stymied exacerbated. 

Less half ball park guess, would surprised real — doubt we’ll ever know though. When? going get bad NY? I’ve observed types things WNY, I’ve heard people saying it’s going get worse Memorial Day, BLM protests, July 4th, etc...there six people ICU county 740K. Percent positive rates dropping 1%. region state fewer 31% ICU beds available.

If we’re seeing data continue look better despite lackluster adherence social distancing rules, that’s great sign we’re closer returning normalcy, reason doom gloom. think anti maskers told masks make difference pushed liberal left. watch fox news I'm sure pushing masks not. believe pushing beginning. Thankfully big box stores making mandatory nationwide, guess better late never.

Remember president made masks political thing wearing mask showing support. wearing mask shows listen science probably watch fox news, likely vote November like Fox news telling vote. Chtulu-22! Surfaces transmission overall considered unlikely, virus stable weeks refrigerator temperatures, theory someone coughed external package could still viable infectious dose many days later. meat would sterilized cooking process.

New York’s death rate still 7x Florida’s 9x Texas’?  removed? never encouraged violence threaten anyone even insulted anyone.. country lying cheating people get ahead

Tell us really feel. [Wear mask, Hey there, vermonter here. I'm seeing comments back fourth masks beliefs contributions low numbers. Vermont divided masks, schools opening next year lot anti masks want kids affected disease also want effecting childhoods. 

The term ""new normal"" hit topic state done best change ever new forced normal ""dangerous"". 

The state lot old people. Old people stay indoors. younger people , even like mask idea, still wear mostly stores. 

We made though summer point big that's whe go camps see people usually don't. higher numbers ""summer"" (our fairs opening year) coming end winter hits cause ski resorts open (cause alot staters guys hot). 

Tldr: yea, old people vocal Facebook stay home, young people vocal wear anyway normal big events shut hike eat icecream. Dude settled years ago, 2020. Lol, started studying mask efficacy past 7 months Makes change windows licking before. Well actually believe contained virus. believe they've ramped testing organized contact tracing. lightly symptomatic carriers, people still get sick quite lot. China also lot high density poor rural population might strict monitoring. ton undocumented people one child policy. mean much see, many spreaders there? might trying tackle them, without reconciling millions neglected people even get basic education, there's way control spread among them.

Also Italy spread started Chinese tourists quickly went up. happened Chinese tourists every Chinese city? China locked way way later countries (Italy locked week two, China covered virus much time).

The way get rid virus people educated trust government knows doing. People China even treated equally. dont really believe effectiveness wearing masks, especially see many people wear incorrectly. people gives false sense security. country (the netherlands) doesnt wear mask reduced amount infected people small numbers. Rather, attribute success quarantine home, social distancing, working home, overall awareness. believe, however, wear nursery homes etc. know kids get sick already, Florida numbers don’t change much (except horrified current outbreak there). new study says symptomatic kids also spread it. one symptoms should’ve allowed inside school reopen, though it’ll damn near impossible make sure that’s plays out.

We still don’t data asymptomatic elementary school younger children spreading others. probably wouldn’t send kids either any, tbh. Pretty sure sometimes right thing get attacked. called ""The fountain falsehoods,"" deliberate strategy imposed leaders wish overwhelm desensitize you.

This psychological warfare feels, receiving end. correct, burlington small population, whole area split bunch tiny cities basically. look Burlington, South Burlington, Winooski, Williston Essex, becomes much bigger population center. people vermont outside cities consider burlington close together  Look 'Moral Injury'. mostly agree you. don’t think average supermarket employee gives damn public good job ties it. worked lot jobs growing never thought tied society overall positive effect anyone wallet. Currently living Vermont, it’s real boring, 3/10 wouldn’t recommend. Half use tree lines It’s essential travel, makes complete sense, tired athletes getting special treatment working 

If don’t agree watch Aaron Hernandez thing Netflix think it. Yes, Sweden bit 500 fatalities per 1 000 000 population USA bite 400 fatalities. Sweden zero collateral damage. here. think looks like could excellent weapon arsenal. course, treatment vaccine may faults, tools have, we're REALLY going able strangle thing. guess players could always play Madden? people probably watch anyway real thing. footage fake?  Tbh almost nothing happens anywhere VT, can’t exactly claim Franklin county, Chittenden classified “hopping.” Well really call 28,420 deaths 260,655 cases (in case Spain) controllable size. Mind you, despite total lockdown including military streets ensure people stick it. think 8 weeks? I'm afraid best numbers show what's still coming. agree impression US however deals 70k cases per day business usual. I'm Germany btw idea bit lighter here. really don't, self entitlement charts. anything like happens immediately go blaming something someone else. Without doubt, without United States world would worse off. things country offer reason people world come live here.  Wait MLB US teams? cheated lied entire life. Attendance school funded. trying maximize resources. Find different method distribute funds may hope. since March 11th I’ve smoked quarter pound. would’ve never able accomplish world normal right now. parents work options children. schools close *all* shut again, parents stay home too. Otherwise, forcing working parents choose dangerous choices, try survive. That's survey shows.  kind mask wearing? There's way 30 minutes even N95 anything you. placebo, imagining things perhaps even psychosomatic symptoms. I'm buying bullshit tbh.

1. Medical Professionals debunked Carbon Dioxide concern.
2. regular gas exchange wearing mask. people think carbon dioxide molecules thick go masks!?
3. pulse oximeter ($25-$40) check blood oxygen saturation? ease mind seeing masks lower oxygen saturation. don’t think it’ll August next year majority Americans vaccinated. It’s going long time. 

The school zoned smallest district, nice. principal seems great distancing plan place. We’ll see goes, even person stuff even happens. right, worked well last time.  need coughing people problem. Breathing enough, somebody walks past stood. 

Think far smoke smell vaping spreads, long lingers. Breathing normally effect, can't sense it.

Your whole argument boils ""Screw you, life worth less convenience"". Get grip. world revolve around you. dead don‘t vote anyway Get ride. think anyone wants lockdown. lockdown want it, forced it. hope rising black smoke carries far away
And never come back town I'm ""white"".

I said "" **Americas** "" [ includes north south] 

Thank *trying*. get obsessed feels like taking crazy pills media scientists saying obviously wrong. Hey, really appreciate that. :) Thanks taking time make day! Yes. Every morning school stand up, face flag (there one every elementary school classroom) place right hand heart, pledge allegiance flag: “I pledge allegiance flag, United States America. Republic stands, one nation, God, indivisible, liberty justice all.”

It used mandatory participate. instances teachers arrested standing pledge. child, could get sent home potentially expelled complying. every day Kindergarden through, believe, 8th grade - age 5 6 till 13 14 years old.

I never noticed weird really years later worked  corporate charitable giving director. 100% funded public middle school East Harlem going closed. re-opening day renovation, attended special school ceremony. color guard, school never (or high school football games anyway - it’s weird thing suburban high school - teenage girls short skirts, little militAry type jackets, tall furry hats strap chin fringed boots, carrying wooden rifles, marching formation pretending shoot wooden guns sort faux military pose. mean WTF, even thought going rails), case group students (in normal clothes - rifles fake guns kind, thank God) carried flag onto auditorium stage led salute front auditorium full students, teachers, parents. pledge allegiance probably 25 years. felt strange couldn’t really quite believe thing - even though I’d spent years every school day myself, never examined weird make children do, even once, never mind daily basis. Congratulations accomplishment White. sure information. truth. 17% USA population(Rural) causing 83% Urban population hardship? understand rural areas cover 97 percent nation’s land dominate Big Land. land starts $160.00 acre(barren). think Big Media, Big Business, Big Economics, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Influence Politics think rural America.

Every one knows rural ""White"" America multinational BIGs pushing ""White Privilege""(Self hating White's weird) also dismissing ""big city"" problems. Oh come sound silly. could Rural America Help Urban America? Let sleep field? Housing land cheaper rural America wages. dont know sayong, care (note, truly expert could explain point concisely without condescending)

But want tell sending CVD positive patients nursing homes good idea, CVD disproportionately kills elderly, anything say 'scientifically' debunk dont speak south American, middle eastern african countries? white liberals hate much? Malinche live third floor building heard first floor idiots playing drinking games friends sound echoed courtyard tonight. hate stupid people. Looool that's joke right?! pnw rains probably 75% school days, amount outdoor learning could happen. Nice job Vermont! #fax stuff like get rewards? swear first time I'm seeing article someone young dying getting rewarded. I'm tired winning second least populous state? Wow! Well little think case right. deaths something right unless think herd immunity right way go. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Maybe. matter got handled, people would shit Trump it. 

*I Trump fan. think he's idiot, ridiculous anything he's evil nothing he's stupid person planet. cough everytime eat drink girlfriend allergic everything constantly sneezing. People definitely stay away. I’m still gonna give mask credit help self esteem tho spend day shuffling words around. assumed DND reference. Yes 40 percent people missed house payments last month. That’s anomaly, norm exactly. say word ""children"" people believe means anyone 18. Defining line necessary. Yeah, totally, disease certainly perceived bad found curable. 

I still see saying ""The cure always worse disease."" wasn’t claiming every district it. it’s brought it’s something one talking about. cousin got younger kids go er bit. also cover mouths rub snot pants though. Ok, fine. meant use ""dozens"" reflection least 12, fine. 

And latter, know prevalent reinfections among unconfirmed infections. even really small percentage reinfections would observed large measure among confirmed cases. 0.1% 14 million 14,000. international community needs know pressure percolates help sorry state affairs god forsaken state. 

Why think would Indian government willing help people world watching? Oh, absolutely! looks get tell people kind math I’m amazing. act like I’m sort genius something always say something effect “Oh, could never that! I’m horrible math.”. try explain it’s harder things. practice get better it. I’m even great math haven’t gotten anything less B+ far (currently Calc III). 

I wish made people take math HS helps understanding life stuff like budgets credit card debt, helps think different part brain. need stop dumbing education laziness. It'd nice, education there's assumption go work sick. went flu fever almost passed make leave saw bad looked.  think Trump would *more* get it. Look Brazil; president “got it” using experience downplay severity disease. It’s gaslighting whole different level. Oh know, probably coronavirus colds started way. might need one two rounds vaccine turn another coronavirus cold. might immune way viruses get inoculated for, immune system train deal suppress serious symptoms presents novel virus.

I hate endless narrative reinfections, vaccines pointless, etc.

We aren’t doomed, something person encountered before. sooner train immune systems attack thing harmless vaccine, better. days would probably cover colds flu year I'd contracted something serious needed surgery something.

Had appendix couple Decembers ago. Surgery went little sideways abandon laproscopy open up, requiring week hospital full month work recover abdominal wall sawed open etc. Burned sick time vacation year (plus max could save prior). Imagine people community dying preventable deaths disproportionately disease color skin Well we’re 70k/day guess it’s hoax /s Hope good thing, issue denial realism. Isn’t statement wages really low?  Maybe shows poorly American workers paid? #fakenews Technically virus never defeated, suppressed. definitely attributes like herpes virus cause flareups stage clinic trials RN? I’ve heard it’s carried squirrels, squirrelly pumpkin. kids staying long possible.  getting massacred it.

They 0.48 deaths per 100,000 population, 340x less NY state. would call level 340x getting massacred? many parallels responses COVID climate change, main difference time scale. cases, one side aisle chose question science rather cogent debate policies best suited scientific reality. 

As negative consequences COVID play orders magnitude faster (most importantly, fast enough within single election cycle) leaders ousted failing respond appropriately. lead even Republican leaders take seriously would climate change (look Abbott Texas changing course masks). 

My hope crisis leads Americans wanting vote leaders listen experts. could saved countless American lives economic damage listening experts beginning, able said climate change. local Meijer Ohio yesterday, big mandatory mask sign entrance. Still plenty people without masks walking around. don’t get it. r/peopleofwalmart I'm genuinely concerned fall/winter. looking like going go cold wet months effectively zero cases, knows. guy has:

.
. Yep. It’s lot jewelry stores normal times. Makes sense me. sub weird cocktail toxic doom naive hope. one possibility people possibly change Trump gets himself. That's it. could spouse, kids, coworkers, anyone close would still deny covid. Even 13 year old wears one this. gets part good health practices. others. absolutely hates complains still wears it. countries shit together. I'm teacher UK. They'd rather die desk. multiple reasons this, one noteworthy opinion limited amount living space.

A great deal Vermont mountain, protected national forest that. Sorry people prioritizing money lives lives others. part problem.

Euroweekly news (and Olive Press) local free newspaper basically adverts mixed BS click bait articles. open week it’s plan. 
Teachers asked 75 questions never got answers. couple quit. want  Exactly. logic flawed 100%. Wear mask inside sit table allowed take 20 minutes eat chat friends. Sounds legit me. make restaurants go take-out/carry-out delivery. Really, employers create better sick leave policies. work rigamarole get sick time &amp; asked kinds questions, docked pay, etc. Leaves many feeling easier come sick deal hassle &amp; interrogations, run around try get Dr's note etc. Instead come &amp; sit quietly desk, hope gets better. May responsible sometimes seems best choice light draconian sick leave policies. good I’m guessing many set purpose cause confusion distrust. Great make buck two. sinister mere capitalism. SHIT they’re fucking human beings aren’t they?! lack federal leadership organization fucking amazing. They're infighting public health professionals. Thousands died stupidity someone named Kevin watching video... fuck. Pretty much entire country stop labeling every Covid pos person dies Covid death, especially crash motorcycles employees getting work done? meeting whatever performance metrics use? so, what's problem? not, talk that, can't fix aspect job, that's let go. going get people wear masks can't even get wear pants? understand conversation appropriate risks CDC even allowed seat table. trump administration said guidance ""too prescriptive"". Local school districts would love get kids back line sight long done safely. agenda safely top down, pretending things back normal everyday people buy misinformation masks. many people going reject vaccine outright believe compliance public health safety? hear saying side one seems care dangers. Obviously?

They’re human beings functioning respiratory systems... likely kids required wear masks, difficult get young child used it, 4 year old wears one better half people see. covid common colds terms transmission? Like covid easily contagious common colds? also common colds stop track almost always guaranteed get colds someone it. wrestling practice, would tell theyre reason ppl dying? are. Im gonna try spare feelings could care less people get offended think illegal sign away rights via contract US A; federal rights important contract sign, win courts law. 

You *can* sign away wavier sue company, organization, individual; found several cases deliberate negligence harmful action organization question followed lawsuits without contract. (Not always, often constitutional rights beat contract.) 

This murky area, really legal sign away rights potential avoidable bodily harm negligence - could argued court law contracts deeply flawed, standing, therefore void. 

**For instance:** director movie set built *properly*, actors sign liability wavier, one star's breaks leg, probably hook lawsuit. (I'll pay workmen's comp, that's already something I'd putting money into.) upheld end contract providing safe, conducive working environment employees ability job safely. 

However, director, build movie set *subpar* even *dangerous*, one actors breaks leg due terrible working conditions, probably going get pants sued off. case *did not* uphold end contract providing safe, adequate working environment employees job safe condition possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

In opinion, one major contributing factors Trump administration blocking CDC giving official guidelines federal level states follow safe reopening school campuses. want federal-level statute provides parents, teachers, school administrators legal ammunition fight back kind behavior seen contracts. 

The Trump administration want parents ability point school district following safety guidelines; could lead lawsuit.

The Trump administration want teachers, janitors, bus drivers, ability legally leave jobs school district endangering lives - ability push back school administrations/district tactics using federal mandates. That's asking whole bunch lawsuits. 

The Trump administration want school administrations districts ability sue state federal government school campus forced open unsafe learning conditions. school district 20 dead teachers sure hell sit lightly CDC ammunition sue state/federal government with.

Not like they'll make situation *that* much worse. third 40 large companies seeking U.S. bankruptcy protection coronavirus pandemic awarded bonuses executives within month filing cases, according Reuters analysis securities filings court records. 

Well part started firms paid bonuses half-year period bankruptcies. Thirty-two 45 companies Reuters examined approved paid bonuses within six months filing. Nearly half authorized payouts within two months. 

These conflicting statements. first casts suspicion whether timing bonuses obvious end run around proscription payments bankruptcy, second simply brings contrast misguided optimism board pay bonuses presumably performance, expecting they'd bankrupt long after. apposed Satan worshipers run many charities. assume fan it’s right username.

Www.Youdon’tsay.NicholasCage.com/surprised going come screaming, troubling headline, strong, definitive study question, that’s part reason hasn’t received widespread attention. small sample size, taken one hospital UK, introduces major selection bias. Maybe true combination patients, also predisposed hospitalized, best, study applied high margin error hospitalized patients given area research conducted. cannot reliably tell anything rest world. doesn’t mean reinfection possible, also doesn’t mean it’s possible, really tells us nothing. 

First, someone needs conduct much larger study (Iceland maybe?) validate results across wide swath positive patients, including asymptotic non-hospitalized people. moment feels like enough evidence believe happen, enough evidence assume widespread enough problem. 

Second, true don’t time study, see resurgence Italy starting around now. don’t, either Italy winning managing virus post outbreak, longer lived immunity described article. Love Chinese people!

We're yet. 1/3 college degree. Im shitting people make money without degree, things speak itself. SMH, cockroach dung like get elected?  That's opposite white people barely wear masks every Mexican family I've seen them. give shit level people died Sweden. would denial care elderly Sweden compared Nordic countries would seen larger proportion deaths higher ages. public data shows report, 89 percent died covid-19 Sweden 70 years old. Norway Finland figure 87 percent Denmark 88 percent.

(Note slightly older population neighbors)

One also ask would believe true? Especially since curve much flatter drawn many others really hear much speculation example Belgium much top ours. think Swedish healthcare system particularly poor compared Belgium's?

What even reasoning behind ""Sweden denied people care""? fact flatten curve much coming normal countries similar total death tolls back normal months. whole point flattening curve, ensuring everyone could get best possible care.

Even corona, everytime got plane would catch cold narcan dispenser yelling me? mean given regulations lifted fast track please keep mind Federal Gov't point, think that's unreasonable.

I mean ultimately, ""Do trust Trump administration safely greenlight.... anything?"" pretty valid question here. first year ever bought Season Tickets professional sports team ever. excited watch local club summer represent country continental play second straight year main Supporters Group. 

As well baseball. Holy hell ever miss spending day Toronto, window shopping trying new food seeing new things night dome. I'm ready end. Misunderstanding something crime.

Wow, take victim syndrome new level. Good luck navigating perils life. need get good chunk US population believing scientists global warming...  lot context involved claim understand, scientists one trusted universities world confident, maybe already pretty solid evidence efficacy, potential efficacy.

Saying trust scientists rather conjure baseless speculation? cool, cheers well.

EDIT: see last paragraph comment responding to, tangent particularly interested in. graph article putting. 

It’s completely exponential, yet Florida leadership isn’t taking drastic measures stop spread virus. Sigh. point even high risk groups well, still roll vaccine mass groups approved form atleast immunity. think it, vaccine healthy people go back work socialism without risk spreading high risk unvaccinated group. 1) Obama categories 
2) Bush cares Katrina? Whoa hold now, you’re trying tell virus part humans natural immunity to, spread certain group humans happen breathe much way humans do?! 
/s years? COVID-19 vaccine cannot development years given disease discovered late 2019. Research vaccines coronaviruses equivalent research vaccine SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19.

Vaccines often long term health impacts, typical vaccine takes 5, 10, 15 years testing development gain approval. Fast-tracking matter months 1 year means corners cut, they're hoping corners less dangerous actually getting COVID. 

We also know research regarding COVID scientific research often produces non-causal correlations subsequent research proves false (just look drastic changes CDC guidelines February April despite substantial sample sizes. Even today, potential long term effects COVID-19 discovered). That's process science: report results reproducible study, verify subsequent studies. 

So fast tracking vaccine best solution we've got, can't argue unforeseen consequences, since improperly validated vaccines dangerous game. okay wait extra weeks iron kinks vaccine distribution. 

We also prepared possibility vaccine impossible. diseases know well, like HIV, vaccine despite promising studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus know well all. am, Fauci said, cautiously optimistic. here. miami things called coladas witch basically 1 part sugar one part expresó. would two coffee morning colada shots followed another coffee lunch maybe shot. one cup day. May something nicotine craving Didn’t downvote you. There’s lot hysteria antibodies long last, there’s adaptive immune system though! U.S. teacher, totally understand coming from! Covid-19 hit U.S., saddening hearing pandemic affecting ways student's parents making ends meet financially. that, understand parents would want kids go school, understand teachers may want reach kids trying times. 

Similarly, AAP (American Academy Pediatrics) also suggested schools must opened, since child abuse happening home, students getting social/emotional connection deserve. 

However, take step back think purpose schools. teachers expected sacrifice lives, like teacher Israel, order allow rest society income? continuous cutting funds course last 20-30 years, forced adhere *No Child Left Behind* *Race Top* put insane amount pressure teachers students, well bullshit teachers deal with, fair ask much teachers? Hell no. issue families making ends meet pandemic shoulders educators. students go back school band-aid solution much larger problem involving poverty distribution wealth. education problem; government funding problem. 

Some would argue going back school could actually make problem even worse, especially reading article post. Based recent back-to-school press conference, fear even proper supplies resources protect students staff (especially considering underfunded general). Teachers, students, community members support education need take action support safe learning environments. personal opinion, safest option would distance learning. know might sound stupid but; students 13 school online used empty schools spread younger kids can’t stay home online schooling effectively? Stay fuck sub starters. people LOVE doomsaying. Agreed! 

I really impressed slow mo fluid dynamics share. Wtf? Yes we

Who TF think possible ? Great. Oxford probably trusted. hope :/ would like dengue pandemic. something even want think tell us to. sounds absolutely dismal. way anyone surprised Let us know get it! tell come please? durp durp Scheduled late January guess masks work well read, long lines 30 mins. rides much less that. could hopeful say less pollution. Perhaps less exposure viruses sorts. 

However another poster said still births increasing rate premature births dropping. believe probably answer. Would really hurt Alabama schools don’t open?  don’t think would change educational rating They’ll horizontal weeks soon said bet 50 dollars one would reply, got like 8 replies....you owe 50 dollars. Facts. way, deniers would say fake news. think difficulty breathing refers problems specific virus: feeling unable completely fill lungs due fluid buildup, able fill lungs still feeling weak dizzy lack O2 due tissue damage, coughing wheezing.

Best monitor symptoms avoid anyone you’d especially concerned transmitting possible, it’s runny nose could anything allergies normal cold covid. youre pretty worried could see getting tested. bet appreciation levels pretty low genders. advice, stop creeper. Winter coming Florida number cases country half population. preexisting condition. racist homophobic fucking moron. horrible timing get results. think researchers would startled they'd study 3% hydrogen peroxide. Lol anyone really think couldn't? sad. Someone good dying. :( right anti-bodies + t-cells + safety issues certainly promising gives reason lots justified optimism. 

And according Andy Slavitt, seen data, one single severe reaction far. People don’t seem realize reason less teenagers died schools shut sooner everything else not. vaccine modified version older vaccine proven safe. real. What's irresponsible saying ""see feel better cut wheat""? Go Oxford!!! Make virus thing past! Yes! actually easier filter particles smaller 0.3 microns due phenomenon describe called ""Brownian Motion"". N-95 mask takes care 95% 0.3 micron particulate.  Don’t worry. Pharmacists always forgotten too. Yeah super weird article feel need write. 

Did know also blood require sleep? know I'm good overall example hated going school never paid attention.

Online school would useful without actually go school. necessarily. Tetanus infect someone once, body can't ramp antibodies fast enough prevent damage. However, vaccine provides stronger immune response previous infection, least good (booster every 10 years think?). remember reading news many military trucks transport bodies different places know put them. couple months ago. happy read now. articles saying vaccine work?

* Settle people Phase 1 results, cases fairly meaningless. get Phase 3 results one looking Phase 1 general safety see immune response. vaccine would still long way away. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Cheers bud Wife NM AZ now. Trade Corona Hatch chili couple months. makes sense  Schools going bloodbath next month. never get 100% compliance anything. vaccine 100% compliance, enough people antivax, works. Stop spreading doom gloom let's focus scientific facts. janitors people fix equipment. They’re important too. Ask everything goddammit. Best generation? There's lot negatives new generation (mostly social media) disagree described mostly seen new generation. 

It's generations (I mean act like first pandemic ever had), stupid selfish people US ages. Think bias teacher teach good school try hanging regular public HS school different opinion. axe! I’m sad terrified coming US. don’t even want go pick groceries. happens get car accident hot spot? October it’s also cold flu season? Ugh. sad. Trump #sad, actual hurts heart sad. shouldn’t happen year 2020. course sub would turn this. maybe lockdowns fucking emotionally, mentally, physically unhealthy everyone regardless political views.  conservative. thing terrifies beginning wave, peak. worst, New York 600 deaths day. Texas lot people New York. bet Trump disappearing Coronavirus. 6 months. least wasn’t “I made terrible mistake” guy again. Yes someone explain throughput morgues work? 100 deaths day (for now) lead overcapacity? found old numbers deaths per day sure capacity morgues usually are. Instead insults, could try explaining think wrong about, far tell solution forced us money problem feds shut fuck get back work. goal ""demand money""! I, exactly like said, demand response virus includes making sure people afford live! part response include federal unemployment insurance, another part funding testing contact tracing apolitical data collection, part response include funding essential workers forced choose health wage unemployment. Like, 100% agree you. want argue thing, robust federal response focuses getting us pandemic. 

Like real, want thing. I've tried agree bunch times. Take care. vocal minority 300 million people still lot people. Shout lab workers. I’m student lab hospital now, microbiology last three weeks poor souls working butts trying handle COVID everything else apologies thought clear using broadcasting instead publishing. tell least five different family members watch news daily happened. seems like television news basically swept absolutely crucial story rug. school district (Washington state) actually seem different plans different ages. Middle high schoolers going school alternating days half school distance learning days. Unfortunately, elementary schools kids every day option full time distance learning, homeschooling fall. (This county major city town semi-rural. making decisions individual districts.) Thank keeping environments CLEAN! deserve way internet thank you, deserve pay raise, sick time, proper affordable healthcare (if that).

You deserve much high five, dude. ... What?

Generally, air indoors recirculated building AC systems, airborne microbes eventually circulate around entire building. many, many cases viral spread apartments shared air &amp; plumbing systems. dont worry credit card debt keep giving new dont keep taking credit cards.

Okay? fun U.S. immune real world much thinks is.

Didn't say was, fact stated propping people negative U.S. losing far faith world stage seem realize. worst shape developed nation. nothing fix it. inspire confidence.

From personal stand point correct, financial stand point wrong. average world citizen lost faith US true. global markets hand play big role currency valuations tremendous faith US. noticed US markets crashed burned? president decided print another trillion dollars. happens one sell us anything? Gotta print money government keep buying stuff.

That's works US, that's like Communism works even stretch. mean really doubt Putin anything vaccine related since Russian hackers caught trying get information vaccines research. expand point, another example, most/all hospitals USA emergency pharmacists point, administer monitor drugs ORs inpatient outpatient procedures hospitals...

You know used hear patients dying, sometimes nurse gave wrong drug wrong dose?

Yeah, we're working prevent that.

Many, many different types people specialists work healthcare, often ways lay people even know about.

We need vaccines *healthcare workers.* clickbait ad money. That's era 24/7 news cycle. Notice headline neglects mention actually tested negative? fearmongering finest. summed thoughts exactly, without saying word. You’re lucky. live , go grocery shopping would say 60-70 percent would wearing masks. better nothing, still think 100 percent Ah actual ""science"" argument favorite. sound like episode Dexter's lab. throw world around insult without research yourself. Please means apply scientific formula me. 

Let's see.. based findings living last 4 months without changing life anyway shape form. I've completely fine. Everyone around fine. people dying streets. apocalypse. lot unnessacary alarm. Why? elderly people might die years gonna die anyway. 

Your using science argue me. overly precautious one actually knows deal this. That's whole thing. unknown. unknown scary. enough data it. one tell going ok. one tell masks actually anything months data meaningless. Scientific studies often take years. revised many many times. science fact. method used find things work. Wearing masks science experiment. wearing one same.

It's cute think 12 - 18 months. going anywhere. exists. going continue exist. like Spanish flu still exists. goinn kill people there's nothing it. There's actual science you. emotions science. 

At end day. live life. gonna end gonna end. knows might develop cancer wearing face covering years time tell. that's last thing worried about. Global warming going get worse. Political divide going get larger. gonna fun decade. Enjoy peace lasts.

So means live fear bubble. really care life much. Leave people alone. mammals unpredictable dangerous creatures put stressful dangerous situation. leave people alone. honestly actively try ruin someone's life participating science experiment really upset anything happened you. covid19 affects cells renders ineffective. also profoundly imprints lymphocytes causes immune system dysregulation. Like HIV hep c.

Edit: Changed attack affect bc want spread called misinformation. note cd147 potential receptor sars 2 (sars 1 used it) still know happens cells. 

There's also paper superantigenicity according sars 2 directly activate cells. Hey, watched movie Downsizing reading today loved it. read IMDb reviews lot people disappointed comedy ethical theoretical strong points consider. They're moaning comedy, denying important issues worthy it. comment really rings true, thank you. lot pointing next authority level instead right thing. Wrong country Well shit, they're human beings too.. +3 deaths today across country. That's back initial levels (february).
ICU 50 (49) 4000+ peak.

On less positive note cases trending imported cases. tourists people living coming back country origin. found poster. brb check facebook pictures see real. wear shorts instead. misunderstood something get upset people call misunderstanding. about?

Grow up. send people AZ nm still count AZ infections. see numbers go hospital bed usage. He’s risk losing election unless people stop dying. 

As said, fastest solution stop testing! testing, blame! it’s always upsetting hear careless governors lot ""kids spread it"" nonsense came countries US, Switzerland UK. anti-vax unfortunate thing people mad us wanting close schools instead mad people make impossible survive minimum wage children unless risk lives :/ even need said? It’s common sense! Capitalism works enough socialism smooth rough edges. using argumentum ad misericordiam logical fallacy stopping us real rational discussion. 

OF COURSE every single individual death bad, even death row criminal dies COVID bad, one arguing intrinsic value human life. 

Can imagine ""let's ban cars protestor"" lost kid car accident? Would anyone dare show statistics extremely low chances dying car crash thus proving logical argument banning cars dumb idea? 

Of course not, called basic human decency. mean side argument right, means nobody insensitive enough tell factual truth face. 

And yes, agree kid ""sacrificed"" same, time, long everyone wears mask, never going infected first place nobody die. 

Masks 100% effective stopping spread COVID long everyone uses correctly, educating kids use masks properly efficient society sheltering vaccine available all. Jeff Bezos could single handedly create new post office money has. ""trolling"" him, Trump better learn that. want try take California Bar November. But, I'm 60, I'm African American compromised immune system. I've self-quarantine since February. Likely STILL form vaccine found. get financial things control, I'm going ask State Bar plan people like me. Excellent thank Won’t argue that- Youth wasted young say. reality hits them, it’s important them. Sigh tell long results?Seems shitty get results 5 days later call Monday lack knowledge diseases spread also outstanding.

I guess guy outstanding ignorance too.

[New York's Covid nursing home policy 'a mistake,' expert relevant quote Rebecca Gould, president CEO Schuyler Hospital Montour Falls, said kept Covid-19 patients hospital rather sending back facility's nursing home.

""We knew beginning could devastating impact nursing home,"" said. r/Science great conversation going study flaws. Remember, scientific studies (especially epidemiological studies) simple nice, tidy Money. Why? why? Ha. Funny. Hm. combined percent getting lower massaging data making new stat? Explain? state periodically reviews death certificates see they've missed cases. report ones find once.

EDIT: Here's  Incredible news, Italy suffered enough Yeah I'm sure magically reduced death rates two days. state also 99% white! sure going need lots emotional support trauma informed pedagogy moving forward. counseling social work dept already constantly busy this, can't imagine many kids needing additional services now. tad early determine sharing suits gave COVID (fire started 12th, article published 17th)?

 
More likely COVID earlier, surprising given crowded conditions normally work in. lot people still claiming that. Mainly anti maskers want admit masks cases places increased mask usage. insisting ""it burned getting warmer.""  Weekend, backlogs. Honestly, completely normal day day data processing. Much kind system built around quarterly yearly figures well. Expecting precise daily numbers what's abnormal infectious disease, course want accurately quickly possible, bottlenecks always happen weekends right folks overtime push divert resources catching create jumps independently virus moving. Here's think. elementary kids typically one class room stay classmates teacher. get middle school switch classes every hour so, exposed many people. mail coming USPS average 2 3 weeks late now... kind assumed coronavirus probably well. pretty much accepted it. Sad true. 
Black lives don’t matter, 
white lives don’t matter. 
The $ thing matters USA 14 day quarantine unless county less 400 active cases per million. edit : yes cloth valve ones protect one I'm happy people experience others have. wish anybody. give unique perspective others never respect easy pass us damaged goods. Let's give six months even total isolation, households (not saying specifically, sentiment prevalent reddit social media) apparently hate other. say together time like normal, challenge theory strongly. think situation I'm broken one, think everybody else is. think healthy family dynamic ""stuck together"" months lead I'm reading elsewhere. perspective someone grew toxic abusive home, yeah see signs posts. offend people, piss off, ignore I'm childfree, bet covid eventually ends things go back normal lot apparent problems magically go away person who's kids fighting daily? they're stuck together, like other, etc? There's deeper issues there. great time reflection lot folks, bad I'll take toxic self therapy 14 days. 14 considered upper bound. 99% something like 11 days.

It week since fire. lot push perfect attendance school, end really means nothing. remember many classmates came sick ""toughed out"" end spreading others

As far people working job sick, terrible work culture enough paid sick leave (and people, none all) Fuck that. hate worked places forced work sick. even worked meat department manager, handling food, forced work sick. never let kids go school sick. rough. Oh yeah, totally agree. I’m doubtful enforce can’t really fault employees. I’m hoping maybe it’ll lead people wearing masks. Dollar Tree typically pays less Wal Mart last checked employees aren’t enforcing beyond store sign seems working (though mask mandated county, it’s strictly enforced). no, definitely giving Wal Mart credit respect here, intention! think takes time get spread, especially since seems like lot symptomatic spreaders possible see hospitalized cases. Maybe lot isn’t right descriptor—some maybe?

Oklahoma weeks ago, example, they’re seeing spikes cases fatalities. Even Ironic American African descent, Vietnam fear murdered racist police ! last two records beaten Sundays though. There's possibility Ade. jobs legitimately fire call sick kid often enough. blame parents this. mean, shit 12 percent. That's tests (including antibody) number. explanation read reason height

Umm, plenty examples adults spreading COVID adults room sitting down. That’s interesting point make. senior 9/11, multiple teachers remark personality shifted abruptly never after. sense safety overwhelming optimism vanished instantly. number deaths recorded now, see could parallel event. It’s lot one day adult handle, much less continuous months someone still child. meeting principal explained kids school actually get short changed education it’s going day focus keeping 6ft apart, washing hands constantly, ensuring teachers sanitize day, little “normal instruction” occurring. Additionally, won’t able “socialize” normally anyways. elementary standpoint. 
Our county decided begin year completely virtually classrooms teaching access materials. Kids safe home focus curriculum instruction instead distancing sanitizing day. Don’t guys think worse idiots getting covid mild cases. se “well didn’t kill fine.” worst case scenario people like this. going get food supplies quarantining? every place delivery. everybody family nearby help them. people quarantine suppose do? Starve? 

This countries providing people need quarantine themselves. doing? groups would be?

To clear, think either protests (from health standpoint) opening businesses rules acceptable. Duh real issue- problem going on, many us still working underpaid essential jobs. absorb cost time takes deal new procedures PPE, workload increased, pay not, taxes high ever, anyone talk whether extend unemployment people safe home. 

Literally, zero discussion extra pay benefits essential workers- absolutely nothing, keep working, paying taxes, putting family risk daily basis less people safe home ""assistance"" making summer. Fantastic news! children shorter,

Well I've found way solve pandemic!

Just adults sit around other. heads far ground childrens' heads.

When get Nobel Prize? asked question regards children getting people think likely contract spread virus adults someone literally responded smaller/shorter stature aren’t eye level adults they’re less effective spreading it.


Excuse me, what??? one argued they're prone getting sick. argument getting help needed aide them. data? won’t accept can't really job computer work important. Imagine cashiers grocery store decided say fuck it? really can't understand Americans anything kick White House. 
What waiting for? quote article, already bans ad network websites publishing medical misinformation harm others. new policy expands include broader COVID-19 conspiracies, ones spreading misinfo possible vaccines.""

This Google taking first action this, rather clarifying general policy. Previously took action limiting people monetizing COVID-19 videos Youtube directing traffic CDC website, likely banned *individual* websites using ads previous policy. pollution many people (60%) default masks motorbikes. getting 90% people wearing masks middle february. Vietnam plan place H1N1 2008. Positivity 12 percent. That's tests (including anti-body) (new) PCR tests only. Media really stop reporting bogus Florida numbers report look numbers dashboard. hard. They've told multiple times. Where's number from? I'd like take daughter unoccupied park wait 5 minutes feel safe.

It's hot AF Houston I've pretty much assuming virus dead playground equipment nobody playing. 3 kids one got sick. God love comments! charts links fantastic!  Come guys joke... Hong Kong local cases like month it’s skyrocketing :/ me. hope stay healthy! 💜 He's gotta go, start ballot impeach again. Thank link. Sad horrible read. earth wrong people say. know Arizona's hospital capacity like right now? give us better picture.  Shocker Lack forensic pathologists weekend? would guess anyway. Mucha fuerza, hermanos Italianos! De esta salimos sí sí!  Good luck fixing willful ignorance

I feel like need acknowledge that, difficult, “willful ignorance” something addressed education, normalization, increased media literacy, availability mental health services.

I think way subreddit treat anti-mask people others like they’re unavoidable force nature counter-productive anti-science.

We turned public’s views AIDS, public perception condoms around height Reagan/Bush administration. Reagan administration.

People keep saying “you can’t fix stupid” literally can. think say “you can’t fix stupid” rally cry status quo. I’m sure you’re talking there’s news footage inside hospitals everywhere  say masks don’t work accept form proof contrary. head, know personal experience, think masks 100% effective, worth using. don’t understand concept risk mitigation.

Here America let decisions dictated science. fucking retarded apparently. Meanwhile Connecticut see maybe 5% mask utilization average day. impenetrable beard save me! try complain, dudes unmarked cars disappear you.  Extremely terrifying. pretty big arguement last night family member seriously believes government going force people take vaccine, microchips it...that way government follow everything do. people literally choosing believe none professionals actual professionals. think doctors people medical world lying. Human behavior pretty interesting. 8 glasses gravy doctors telling us drink? Keep use mouthwash too? agree, I’m definitely suggesting don’t want painted someone downplays lethality contagion. concerned lack transparency data people’s presuppositions must manipulated one way since unable view topic without first filtering red/blue funnel first. feel like can’t dumb. playing part voters, know full well risk wearing mas. reason say people cunning get elected first place.

oh wait, youre serious. let laugh even harder

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA They're probably desperate Brazilian Donald. bet think get selected &amp; go trial they'll better chance survival. I'd rather homeless? elected official say anything Trump ever again, needs resign. impeachable behavior - dereliction duty. actually worse that. 9026 PCR antibodies added together maximize confusion :P

Look dashboard there's separate entry total PCR tests reported day. 7836 today, means 35% positivity rate. Yes can. Nursing homes rely heaving Medicare Medicaid funding. Nursing homes terribly run staffed.

Federal funding funds facilities, better staffed organized could clean “dirty” wards, organized much better fashion.

Even testing people exhibited flu like symptoms tested negative strep flu, positivity rate high.

It could well something else like Bronchitis something. Interesting. 

This would lead closer conclusion that, reason, people develop complete antibodies virus catch it. Texas teacher strike, stand chance losing teaching license. may interject, correct term would cockwomble. bad, thought taking Trump.

Cockwomble
Cockwomble (noun)A person, usually male, prone making outrageously stupid statements and/or inappropriate behavior generally high opinion wisdom importance. That's really good point bet lot people thought of. high Republicans sentencing Americans death caring. moved rage easily article makes want throw things White House. Egg yolks face incredible Asian countries using masks flu season decades, USA like ""we believe studies anyone here."". Articles like annoy end assume lack evidence back CDC saying masks necessary.  evidence already exists, pervasive belief American exceptionalism. Woops, st paul Way good likes him,But least entry level.    party holds white house Senate anything? They've months  talking data scientist Florida? Rebekah Jones? 

She fired changing data make look like pandemic severe. opposite seen people say online. 

From see, people claim government agencies trying make things look worse order tank economy make Trump look bad install laws control people (lock down, face masks etc). 😁 OK, wrong Washington state, swear large (or least vocal) number died wool anti-vax. ""I really learn mistakes"", republican probably. know, team lead got sick early year. (hallmarks covid ""it's continent yet"" stuff.) 5 us got sick.

Or least admitted sick.

Of course none us used sick days, even Canada. 10 hour shift means get fraction total sick days hour opposed day.

(premier alberta screwed things bit regards retaining employee rights, that's different discussion.)  think read lung volume pressure something it.

Enjoy high crime rates riots. subway stabbings lol Wonder much marines contributed Yeah, unfortunately point, people change minds this. turned ""my rights, I'm American, unconstitutional"". There's swaying opinions that's irrational standpoint starting at.  think see saying: saying get total number given day NEXT day, total graph.  I'm logging whatever number happens time look webpage, might 6pm (most days), fluctuate bit.  

Yeah, way better way it.  Mine precise.  But, still pretty close.  Whatever extra add one day subtracted next (my days lopsided... longer 24 hours less... still zero sum game matter it). close enough submit publication whatever, close enough see basic trends.  

I'll probably start way suggest, though.  Thanks pointer. referring places like Texas Georgia southern states, California also reopened around time. Well, won’t happen Wal-Mart’s mask rule goes next week. prevent ERs overwhelmed? can’t keep patients hospitals forever need beds. God wants use zoom church goers, god wants use door church.

Right, got ass kicked learn anything it. riots similar casualties Stop trying feed talking points downplay problem. Bruh would mask stop condoms it’s like penises sneeze anything currently live Oklahoma. (Not choice)(not MUCH people) name kevin stitt. fucking moron. claims step back reopening efforts (paraphrasing here) ""if people want take measures protection see appropriate, right to..."" also trump coming tulsa first rally, despite SLIM safety measures. (The rally like half capacity, days leading immediately rally, tulsa saw pretty big spike cases. also known say hilariously untrue things coronavirus. Masks protect getting COVID 19, people complete morons. long got downvote I’m good Shut boomer Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhh    would imagine danger would come roommate/s. nothing else it’d good talk see protecting (wearing masks washing hands whatnot). I’m honestly dumbfounded still dormitory housing despite evidence bad idea is. Sounds like something cockwomble would say. According world meters Orange County NY zero deaths zero cases today. meet Trump rally?

Shocked! Shocked term I’d use magically pooped rainbows. Getting corona taking proper safety measures inevitable point. announced death camps infected would still 36% approval. Another reason get extra dollar hour.  I'm curious. story many, i'm American, flu-negative virus damn near destroyed me. lasted almost four months, still numerous bizarre residual effects today. went doctor, area Covid tests yet, negative flu A/B, listened lungs said pneumonia despite coughing mouthfuls fluid worst it. 

My now-ex fiancee lived Europe, flew mid November monthlong stay. Shortly got here, got brutally sick, got week so. Shortly after, started showing bizarre symptoms snowballed coming weeks, lasted mid December (when left) mid April. 

The big variable: told, lot businesses town AirBnb owned Chinese-American couple, regularly traveled back forth two, owned import-export company. 

The time talked ex since broke December (due Covid, likely would've never seen anyway,) mid April, she'd rushed hospital damn near died it. second infection serious seems unusual, clue think anymore. ""They produce crap consumer products break looking them""

Because that's order. also produce lot high quality goods buy cheap shit expect.

It zero amount local cases long time. Also last outbreak Beijing hundreds. see never believe them, choose look facts spew bullshit. swear, reading subreddit Europe surreal.

Yeah, we've known they're effective, US keeps ""discovering"" twice week... tiny bit research learn “saviors” all. Cuomo build fuckery healthcare country older Trump-humping relatives starting wear masks think infatuation slipping bit. I'm glad, disturbing watch people know willing die due ignorance rather try normal.

There people would eat feces Trump told wish exaggeration. It’s herpes it’s Lol “sight” sources. hospitals empty, huh? Right...

So you’re one idiot conspiracy theorists thinks COVID lie and/or actually serious? Shouldn’t Twitter accusing someone random celebrity baby eating Satanic pedo? maybe coffee shop harassing teenage staff ask put mask? 

Btw, obesity increases risk developing complications COVID. thought aware that. reason. Minorities already known disproportionately impacted, health economical.

Also USCIS begging $1.2B cash infusion stay afloat furlough 70% staff, course slow legal immigration naturalization.

I seen evidence governments world education campaign risks SARS-Cov-2. efforts centred around spread virus information available need spread virus available like keep informed access wide variety news sources.

Most information filtering/dripping people like read ""a flu"" kills old people. narrative everyone else getting dramatic trying force compliance harsh rules restrictions fits honestly cannot appreciate risk.

There's BIG difference ""bunkering place"" (whatever fuck is) requiring people wear piece cloth faces. ya know what???? people wear mask virus count goes life goes closer normal. Thats NY worked.

I wanna knee fucking idiots skull. claim victory. They've calling conspiracy hoax months. they're going manipulate lie leading people cry foul conspiracy. creating false equivalency encouraging usual ""both parties same"" bulshit discourage votes Right. Like it’s young people working service jobs, essential jobs, healthcare, etc. it’s young people don’t wealth fall back on. It’s young people need pay rent avoid ongoing eviction wave.

They reopened everything, refused pay people stay home, wanna shame young people getting virus control? Fuck that. Young people done everything can. point they’re going parties seeing friends, that’s govt, them. fuck expected care federal govt doesn’t? 

A pandemic individual responsibility. requires massive coordinated federal response, universal healthcare, public safety net, none backwards ass country. Time use 25th amendment FACT 1: Excess mortality USA back normal levels (below 2: Europe COVID ended (excess mortality normal levels) week 22 (**7 weeks justify testing funding decreased? party mental That's fine, too.

""More possibility"" Okay. science works but. Stay safe! What's important? Economy people dying? hate everyone everything year. Even handled well things looking like guaranteed win him.

But public demanding vote mail (which anyway), installed new Postmaster General loyal him. covid continues worsen, he’ll turn around agree voting mail able tightly control normal voting process. already directed new Postmaster slow mail, due budget cuts USPS severely understaffed. telling might election nears. might post office fail deliver on-time millions ballots blue/purple states. lose, he’ll insist fixed him. He’s already establishing private paramilitary force DHS already used Portland kidnapping people streets. probably practice run expands (which leaked memos DHS already approved). 

So he’s preparing pretty much everything (probably ideas, signed them) remain power regardless election results. He’ll fix favor, doesn’t work he’ll use force. What? Literally every single person know lives NY migrated Florida pandemic. NY handled “well” everyone left. south least I've noticed upper middle age/baby boomer crowd giving fuck. Young people generally careful exception firsr opened everyone partied like tomorrow. *always* boomer crowd antagonizes work masks.   I've debating co-worker regarding homemade cloth masks whether work prevent/reduce spread corona virus. One points clinical studies prove cloth masks reduce transmission. looked studies, although diligently, honest can't find clinical studies cloth masks. found studies regarding medical masks healthcare workers reducing transmission.

Obviously trusting institution like CDC good organization trust given 95% donations employees go 1 political party, feel like reaching many pediatricians across political spectrum hear opinions analysis would reasonable way assess wide variety risks children face every day chicken pox, flu, SARS-CoV-2, wearing masks, exercise, balanced diet, social interaction among peers, hit car way bus, kidnapping, sexual abuse, physical abuse, etc.

If took current administration realize US government cannot trusted strong grasp science, really look back US history better. many examples US government proven slow moving comes scientific advancements. design, simple politics, true since least early 1800s late 1700s US government already behind laws court cases vs scientific advancements.

This article two goals. 1. Highlight age make believe young people high-risk death 2. Make feel bad order influence behavior. 

The term “American dream” perfect language manipulate feelings. actual fuck 140,000 dead US alone still people thinking fake. 

What joke. Seriously, even without virus, anyone gets NICU wear damn mask? many way, second amendment.

Too bad required balls also lacking US. He/she clearly is. deaths low compared March-April? got way infected day yet deaths seem stay decrease want get re-elected. controls many confirmed cases going declare successfully battling virus. dumb asses eat up. I’m sure you’re whining unrelated things, already said obviously everyone aware lots things weren’t done well, particularly beginning idea doing. doesn’t way relate question well curve kept flat after. 

The point *shape* curve context. entire country wishes shape curve matched NY’s. Could NY done better beginning make raw numbers curve lower? Obviously. separate question one referred here. Also pathogens Europeans brought many considered ""childhood illnesses"" wearing sunglasses, forehead got burned entirety youth taken away.

Heh. electronic overhead freeway sign near says stuff like this. anyone know get one signs ballot Georgia? remained calm offered good advice throughout this, arguably providing better leadership Kemp. must joking. You’d never survive. Well said. I'm 34 never achieved American Dream either.   point US pandemic itself. I'm 100% masking. I'm trying understand influx articles make sound differently. sure missed something somewhere. Thank you. :) imagine great 2020 could certain human beings could stay fuck away bats &amp; exotic animals. # active virus (infectiousness) × time exposure. Makes sense. long hauler mean someone (like you) who's prolonged symptoms issues caused Covid originally? know, prolonged effects even seen asymptomatic cases? correct? 2016 voted man, four years later regret TREMENDOUSLY. voting shit bag lunatic again. Spot on. threads top comment sort shitpost. wrong statistic upvoted correction buried below. almost gone bad early days, back inundated conspiracy theorists South rising again! split Washington two states done this?

I'll give parting advice we're topic. go around labeling cautionary posters reddit doomers, run risk labeling edgy edgelord. Interesting bothers need trucks... legit waiting commercial something showing 2021 yearbook flipping like senior quotes page akin anyone passed away year.  Maybe somehow make real push/impact remote learning occur pandemic control.

Schools going shitshow. think isn’t buying ads, demonetizing websites. I'm uncomfortable 73F. hope Scottish/English genes withstand global warming lol. could determine direction transmission, calculated proportion detected cases equation [number detected cases/number contacts traced] × 100, excluding index patient; also calculated 95% CIs. compared difference detected cases household nonhousehold contacts across stratified age groups.

I think water wet think. kids bring home every cold flu would different Covid-19? Moving goalposts, see. Shuffle along. Well, children younger 10 appear drive covid19 transmission even though contract virus show comparable viral loads shedding patterns adults. Scientists know yet. 

My point ""common sense"" (knowledge though personal experiences bias) unreliable science (knowledge rigorous study) needed. saying deaths counted COVID. still can’t explain away excess deaths. asked, put hands ears shout, “lalalala...”, like child. societal scale, contemplating worst case scenarios psychologically blocking out.

""Surely can't bad"". Transmission little kids young people something people find disturbing uncomfortable think about, play mind games other. scientists academics pop bubble logic. 

The reason intellectuals hated groups cut society's misconceptions force look ugly things time time. Pure bliss satisfy thinker. hotel last month.. signs required masks. first really happy..

Pretty much guest decided want wear mask would walk back entrance, mask on.. wander hotel without it.

It honestly baffling. 40/50 year old adults acting like spoiled children think rules apply them.   rot deep. deep within society. science denying moron president face rot. Yeah, no.

If first one taught us anything, would spread COVID parts world. believe literally rest entire world far better us Top 10 anime betrayals huh  First need make funeral business great again. school nurse?!?  Bussed crisis actors. Yeah...they take ""fall"" window. *Reads last paragraph*

*Then looks Portland*

*shrugs* tons daycare break outs Texas. 

The argument essential employees go back work teachers essential employees deal adults able abide rules, know cover cough sneeze, etc. also large grocery store space social distance. school, lot different. crappy time single. I'm big dating time I'm like ""when ever gonna able date again?"" Ohh people aren’t going like one.. got 14 need more? think might problem way Texas chose respond this. fact say need tak USA really sad country. competent leader.  Cute.

(-; coroner investigation still open case cause death someone think children human? Another factor elementary school there's usually one two teachers single room 20-40 students. would somewhat feasible restrict contact people room, would ideal. 

In middle high school there's 100s 1000s students travelling throughout building different classrooms teachers. teacher comes contact 100+ individuals day, students probably contact even since every class exact 30 students, mixed up. Unless live surrounding state vacation lake side house family friends. 

With friends might great idea right immediate family vacation without seeing anyone.

I'm really lucky teach great school. lot work coordinate worth it! super high success rates, usually 1-3 kids pass given class. really feel workers, people posting version story every day months don’t really know it. know mean. hard time keeping temper situations like this. worry could get trouble one day. can’t imagine walking something like trying politely get stop. Back terrible management. job, everyone general idea job, what's expected, means I'm week, someone covering work since would priority. priority, mean I'm boss, everyone else us. work comes first, whether I'm not. Staying in-character shows truly master trolling arts. applaud dedication. Yeah thats pumped trillions intonthe stock market gains wiped wave foreclosures evictions coming, schools amd businesses reopening making damage fucking worse? kidding. United States declared victory numbers dropped 20K new cases per day. contrast really striking. suspect ""100 cases = control"" much better way looking this. Compared us, control. feel like restaurant safe precautious prevent it. wear masks, face shields, gloves, change every time common surface touched dealing guest. outdoor seating it’s spaced accordingly. They’ve shut streets town accommodate restaurants, it’s huge success. People pretty great wearing masks. tell someone every then, one flipped yet. Overall, I’m hoping find safe way reopen temporarily restructure get virus control. say eating mask public endanger others you.

EDIT: kind Redditor pointed meant “WEARING” “EATING” damn autocorrect! exactly. need push Overton Window. I'm sure America survive another 5 months incompetence. go... enter idiot  Florida REACTS: ""Hey extended family, let's go Vermont!""

Ok? article related anti-vaxxers though. European countries seem mask issues themselves. it’s States people actually send care problems. I’ve heard lot. Schools = daycare. don’t kids parents summer usually?

Do send kids paid daycare work? I'm sorry family. However, husband needs choose nobility teaching. medical issues gave profession unnecessary unethical risks placed upon us West. 

Frankly, five days per week. harsh truth matter teachers professors acting like sheep. know latter term used conspiracy theorist idiots, case, accurate. power boycott refuse. However, want self-martyrdom everyone else pay it. Someone needs stand up. Texas seen 110% increase cases linked childcare centers two weeks. Almost 2,000 cases connected childcare centers, though unclear started. 1/3 cases children. childcare workers. FUCK *threw feces*

Beautiful comic Look Canada coped SARS - said they'd ready next time. 17 years ago successive governments ""forgot"" reduced supplies ...

 5G...lmao! Oh, looked like wrestling gator need take pants wrestling.... looked details it, looks like real effect transmission, maybe majority infections isn’t surfaces. shown direct mid-day sun, virus get 90% deactivated early reports said kids don’t get caronavirus much data listen data agrees narrative. Like man don’t get fight wearing mask understand can’t see something catching spit coughs sneezes something might much mitigate something we’re told cough sneeze elbows hands cloth catches germs? Blows mind dude. I’ve tried years get people understand psychology uninterested. want unlock understand potential mind? Westport shitshow. breweries. bunch bars restaurants -- places wear mask walk door take spread germs anyway. There's almost never weekend passes without incident. Used several music venues ever increasing gun violence, there's one main one small stage back bar now. Also, matters, mask mandate require masks outside. cops see seem 50/50 wear masks (I live next bar elsewhere city, see semi-regular basis responding shit there). can’t legislate compassion compassion big part beating this. still good news! 

That surely depends whether hospitals max capacity not. Bergamo's hospitalizations plateaued Covid infections not, deaths skyrocketed large *because* hospitals taking higher number patients. Arizonas reporting place? One day 100 deaths next day 30 deaths, cases seems like real trend numbers it’s weird Florida. Noone listen. meanwhile , Florida close 350k cases Disney continues open young people continue party Florida. that’s really it. afraid. I’m not. follow rules yes. understand aren’t closely. really aren’t repercussion one self. really really slim chance young. make okay follow rules? No. people people.. Don’t worry, consider far right president trump majority decisions. I’m sure others like me. confirmed causes long term damage majority people, way overstating actual results. doubt musicianship, music everyone. drugs, experience angle. college students? troll, suppose a.really committed troll, give anything away lol.

No, I'm 100% serious, despite however may feel.  Florida collapses entirely, needs like Thufir Hawat. happened Brazil? Number drop 40k ba days ago 1k today. op literally worship Queen's stool. called grooming stool shits uk subjects citizens supposed worship point discussing glossing saying moving goal posts, back pre-election spin loops interest again.

You said, Boris isn’t inclined behaviour.

There 5 meetings opening NHS US private health industry.

That documented fact, lying Corbyn presented media, Corbyn quoted Channel 4 dispatches investigation exposed talks.

Therefore, type behaviour inclined do, point discussing it, seem want argue Boris’s side whatever facts are.

I’ll read reply anymore, want argue bad faith. Yep everything US’ fault, ramping production meet demand? it’s consolation, first friend develop serious complication CoViD-19 going make happy you’ve careful been. know think replying to, 

I'm replying someone thinks smarter are, really fooling anyone actual brain. wouldnt let upvotes get head. praised neanderthals isnt really show intelligence. I'll say again. I'm aching get back normal. I'll let poke vaccine eyeballs. count this, disappointed.

It's really unrealistic think fully tested vaccine short amount time.

I'm sorry, feel better realistic build hopes crushed. Agree, headline writers suck. “Algal nasal spray originally researched fight HIV shows promising results COVID-19 trials” accurate, serious. Less click-bait-y. problem is, people go spread virus blabber anyone listen garbage. Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea chest pain common COVID symptoms. Even adults. mean definitely COVID? No, symptoms common COVID. ... welp. remembered poor decision. Sure, responded statement saying presidents statement young people survive initial infection still 100% true.

I’m way saying schools open, sick subreddit constantly taking outlier cases evidence things worse are. think main difference freezer trucks come icecream. immunologist, guy spent last 30 years leading product development teams.

I stand points. ""Modified"" mean anything, may may work.

I happy anyone working vaccine arrives, create low-pressure environment minimal visibility reasons mention. Deniers could find 'proof' piece dust want to. article say going counted covid death, simply says boy covid symptoms, 100% correct. job bend backwards cater deniers never, ever convinced matter much proof they're given. I’ve saying would happen since mid-March. able invest divorce lawyers, would’ve dumped fortune stock back then. surprise it’s starting materialize. 

Also, inevitable Covid baby wave starting December, probably newly single parents. Yikes. Oh it'll get there. explanation besides fucking dumb able understand deaths lag infection. fast killing disease, give 2-4 weeks. think get close normal year ends many doses already better treatments way would curious coronabortions... going? Effectively makes sound like good thing lmao staying Airbnb, camping. short, article quotes selection subjective opinions several people, mechanistic experiment artificial droplets virus anecdotal event control group. One would think mask wearing clearly important beneficial everyone wants believe, better selection arguments article. 

Meanwhile, Czech Republic, petition stop measures, ""masks enough"". me, frankly horrifying: order push others wear masks, large amount people keep overblowing effect despite continued absence actually sound evidence based wishful thinking, approach leads. 21st century, could fighting pandemic advanced technology tracing testing, instead fighting woth piece wet cloth, easier cheaper. keep saying it: would one finest scientific events human history get vaccine quickly combat pandemic. figure insured person’s co-pay. Except crazy relatives swearing vote him. add Black people distrusting medical establishment new thing, actually pretty well-founded. past centuries, White American doctors notorious experimenting Black patients without informed consent generally lying them. 

I know think things ancient history, they're not. mean, Tuskegee syphilis experiment end 1972, well within lifetime many Black people alive today. 

It's awful, put huge well-deserved distrust American medical system Black people together actual racism within medical system much exists, combination makes health outcomes Black people US hugely worse be, know that.

I expect, though, reluctance die lot White people get vaccine Black people longer feel like they're used guinea pigs. fiance's district planning hybrid model 7-12 full-time person K-6. Yes please! don’t need lot..just couple debts virus never going completely gone. (USA) aren’t island ensure 0 cases virus. LIVE this. Hopefully get vaccine works life go back normal. let take course.  Hey major hospital issues? Bad prediction. Getting thing september would probably one greatest human accomplishments ever over, would like finally do? I'm taking family leaving country (US). think urban area schools lower socio economic areas worked really well. Many students would put effort  totally are, kind weiner.

And say causing resort ad hominem attacks arguing people talking way think should. 

This point making, would point agreeing new projects goals differ minutiae productive divides important resource - people energy.

Which point making. Instead wasting energy manpower giving president excuse cut funding force people back work divided demands, United demanding response virus includes making sure people afford live.

Just demanding money means easiest solution force everyone back work soon possible. goal? goal. interest public coincide interest charge took going viral next level, that's sure! would’ve thought young humans still humans think convincing argument I've seen sending kids back school yet want 2020-2021 yearbooks multi-page ""In Memoriam"" sections. justthenews.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yes, could something else, else circulates time? seems plausible test falsely negative. especially true cases digestive tract affected. Fecal tests might accurate. None conclusive all, article states.

The actual facts reported. He's tested positive, no-one exactly sure killed COVID, he'll get another test autopsy. Even title acknowledges saying COVID-19 symptoms. never say non sequitur. making point whether trust scientists high confidence results they're seeing could mean road ahead.

What long term ramifications generation young people go sustained isolation like this? 

I would argue side effects would enormous: extremely blunted social skills, depression, ptsd, stunted emotional skills like empathy, social problem solving, self-esteem, etc. This, itself, could result generation people cannot access economic world 12 years public education prepared for.

Ok, much need? know seen one yet. meal prepper? diaper? thought masks protect person getting covid, masks prevented person spreading Covid another person. “No offense he’s Oklahoma” -Hank Hill That's true, least social circles (mostly college students people office jobs) lot nonessential partying/travelling going never sent covid patients nursing homes, obv.

I’m doctor works nursing home disagree. 

Let’s go back April, looking projections 130,000 hospital beds needed peak, state 53,000 beds statewide. started creating surge capacity units tent hospitals Javits Center Comfort, even reached maybe 90,000 beds. 

Under Standard situations, discharge stable people nursing homes. Nursing homes stranger infectious disease; handle tens thousands flu cases every winter, get C.Diff infections year round. good isolating contagious patients come back hospitals. Covid patients come confined rooms allowed lounges common areas, staff put masks gowns gloves going in. isn’t first time handling contagious patients. 

What choice healthcare system send Covid patients back nursing homes? Group homes assisted living exempt regulation would take patient tested negative twice. takes average 3 weeks, meaning patient taking bed cannot ship even though stable nothing babysitting them. time need every hospital bed get, alternative there?

And today know 10 days appears infectivity despite testing positive weeks longer. also know &lt;6000 Covid-positive patients sent nursing homes time 37,000 nursing home staff tested positive going work positive tests. Since data showing there’s low rate staff getting sick work PPE, it’s likely brought infections work home, current conclusion NYS Department Health. It’s starting last phase testing 5G, Covid-19. Wholey shit. March, explanation call post excursion malaise sounds much like stronger version I’ve struggling since. partner thinks I’m crazy it’s head, cancer, something way could still sick 3.5-4 months later. Nowhere anything I’ve read collaborate it, I’m afraid go doctor case think I’m crazy too. create petitions White House government website start calling Congress representatives go WTF?! I’ve wondering air conditioned air northeast versus rest country.

I’ve never really spent time northeast—is air conditioning common? It’s definitely common south, midwest know isn’t common people’s houses restaurants businesses. Still, eating outdoors summer popular midwest south lived there. gods name wrong people?!?!?!!

It’s almost try find absolutely worst things could possibly fuck everything double it.

In worst part entire GOP complicit they’re still jobs!

Somewhere along line, America went shit nobody noticed Trump. first time heard someone recatching it? He's hardly first. Though there's debate whether people re-catching it, going dormant flaring weeks later. New York call Cuomovirus Public health officials known get people listen years.

It takes leadership, broad-teaching campaigns, focus alternatives making things safer rather total abstinence radical life changes.


The US lacks leadership make happen. Oh coughed? Welp, mind little ol' anti-aircraft gun. Sadly many, MANY idiots make vast majority state. Ehh. pretty embarrassing twenty years. math kinda sucks.

Let's hypothesize median loss immunity occurs around 6 months, left tail starting around 3 months.

At end March around 200K confirmed cases. sake hypothesis lets say 3 3.5 months around 5% people lose immunity (the tip left tail distribution centered 6 months). Currently US approximately 0.3% chance contracting (confirmed) case 2-week period. 

0.3% * 5% * 200K. would expect see around 30 cases.

So, handful cases absolutely _**necessarily**_ indicative disregardable anomaly. could start left tail _typical_ loss immunity quite short (single digit number months) timescale.

You **don't know** whether not. say great confidence, statistically, mathematically, **can't know, yet**. take months data know.

Edit: 6 month median, stdev around 1 month would appropriate guess, accounting reporting lag means we'd looking 2-3% confirmed cases end march pool. keep seeing articles make sound like masks protect wearer. thought way around? someone lives there, appeal people? know people like come sickness get change heart turned ideals party? got one junior year high school. amazed cuz mom got breakfast first hour PE every week two. Turns show later day still counts full attendance. 25% herd immunity cuts transmission COVid 50%, vaccine works 50% time, looking massive drop rate spread honest want feel bad exactly Darwin talking about. Twat waffle Man, every day guy fewer fewer fucks give diplomacy. fantastic. that's Trump got Covid19 light cure from. test anyone comes contact him. I'm guessing get within ten feet without tested.  One elected Senator never understood exponential function.

It inevitable disease would time become concentrated populations took precautions. groups well educated, indifferent welfare others, also groups thought masks social distancing symbols political adversaries godless science.

They care much deaths political rivals. disease taking advantage decades rhetoric supporters... would explain excess deaths there?

That said, UK ridiculously high death rate compared nations, would make sense end lowering Paywall :( Shove light-bulb ass me, thanks. remember fucker faces names loved ones infected inaction complete fuck attitude. Remember faces, faces real virus. still right thing even government force to. plenty young people going socializing hate trump Interesting.  Well, days log numbers earlier... usually noon.  days around 6 7pm.  method, words, consistent.  numbers always changing... always variation sources (worldometer seems higher get, every time).  I'm sure something along lines.

I fully expected week bigger last few.  expecting big uptick... far seeing it.  appreciate younger people making sick population, also treatments covid gotten better/more successful. Came comment “dumb ass” like comment better. Reluctantly agreed. I’ve patients refuse tests don’t want “tracked.” Contact tracing? get 100%. It’s useful makes sense case someone suppressed immune system gets exposed. 

I understand it’s nice know you’re en route covid patient, it’s part job (used EMT). never really know you’re gonna roll arrive scene. hope best prepare worst every call. Besides, patient tell covid, especially ask, healthcare workers wearing n95s regardless (even they’re old...better nothing) States basically different countries   true comment don’t think media many people willing openly talk about.

Okay 🤷🏻‍♀️  another perspective NY ones bent took hardest Whatever happened real conspiracy theories? Like mattress stores front money laundering. Doesn’t sensitivity PCR timeliness (e: in, detects ongoing infection, instead resolved ones).

I’m virologist colleagues antigen based saliva test would sensitive enough catch high viral loads. Something like strep rapid test. Perform every couple days weekly depending kind population we’re in, bam, good strategy.

It boggles mind haven’t made rapid test yet, even decently characterized antibodies. happens disease comes back.

Less 1/3 many official cases USA, almost amount deaths.

So almost 100 million fewer people nearly total deaths far less 1/3 cases.

Does make sense you? maybe scale Europe’s outbreak much greater, weren’t capable identifying cases larger percentage went unidentified.

We pretty well measures showing decreasing trend. Cases 620 day testing positive rate 0.5%. 1200 people hospital covid, 130 ish ventilators around 50 deaths day (all settings).

Every measure except first still shows consistent drops I'd expect deaths fall 20 ish end month. New positive cases stabilised 600 day past 2 weeks now, coincides pubs reopening 2 weeks ago. Complicating matter however testing increasing focus hotspot areas.

so they, like Covid 19 coronavirus tend cause abundant viral load saliva mucus making relatively similar ease transmission.

The innate immunity, part immune system inherited recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) things lipopolysccharides bacteria RNA viruses. see ""sars-cov-2"" mechanism recognize specific viruses, instead recognizes generic structures say ""virus!"" ""bacteria!"".

Now course people inherited decreased likelyhood catching disease inherited decreased likelyhood dying disease mean previous ancestor developed immunity exposed disease. mechanism inheriting adaptive immunity like that. factor inherited difference immune system all, could something else.

Beyond that, people die virus vast majority well beyond reproductive age seems unlikely would much recognize difference resiliance disease ""survivors"". Firstly simply dangerous normal healthy human reproductive age unless comorbidities extremely unfortunate. Secondly vast majority people die already children going have. black death type scenario, 30-60% population could die might realistic think survivors inherited resistance disease disease might become weaker simply that. isn't.

Smallpox also 30% risk death frequently killed people reproductive pre-reproductive age impossible groups exposed long time might individuals resilient due inherited factors. would due random mutations natural selection inherited adaptive immunity. would due inherited differences immune system all.

Like said, evolution work growing gills response flood. works killing less suited survival, leaving well adapted reproduce greater numbers. disease kills less 0,5% population, vast majority elderly, going great driver evolutionary change. attacks cells

Cite? ever doubt? study needed this? mean, sure, police annoying leads citizen deaths. That's kind whole problem less know goes. case last 5 years, never took 10 sick days per year. Probably never 5. maybe holidays...

Anyway, company 'ecosystem', learn place.


Edit: anyway, sorry system quite fucked up... :( many cities like that. unfortunately states getting hit hard.

Personally feel geography. South hot stay inside. think makes spread, LOT. north would likely hit hard Fall. really good advice draw good point. It’s lose/lose scenario, one outcome far worse other. much would crushed long-term relationship ended, would even crushing family member’s life ended. europe primary schools open caused even 1 major spread. course could coincidence, people 14/15+ seem spread virus significantly younger people. I'm sure countries issues deal with, lot faith actually able it.

They'll also starting flu season baseline almost Coronavirus cases US basically partial leper colony point. plastic face shield absorb aerosols. Airborne particles easily travel shield. 

Synthetic masks like made polyester nylon also good. kind fabric kind skin. comfortable first stretchy, time make sweat skin break out.

The best kind mask made layers cotton fabric, like quilting cotton. get Etsy $10. completely worth get nice home-made mask. offer better protection feel better face. One roommates dad tested positive coronavirus yesterday. tested Thursday. last saw week ago. None us (my two roommates I) symptoms. supposed get tested? kinda agree you, governments magically supply food, energy, healthcare. People going leave homes keep essential parts economy running provide food, power, health, etc. Anyone still supports POTUS would need severely severely (like two iq points higher potato) brain damaged justify support did. bolted sign door 'Covid 19 party'. kind balanced out. mention colleges That's bold move Putin, let's see pays still COVID-19 age. idea number low. I'm disputing number, conclusion. said headline wrong, basing one unusual value. couple bumps graph 7-day average, trend clearly downward. Perhaps change future, make headline wrong. really wanna know much doctor claimed kids transmit disease well paid. lose license something saying unethical shit like that? all. Irony: article written negative manner pointing discussing negative behavior. 

It's kind like someone hitting kid hitting another kid.   things think of. Government putting efforts countering virus.
1.They worry payment (retirement/SS) 
2. Long term big boost health insurance companies. (All ailments caused virus (for survivors)
3. Life insurance (more likely) include clause, cover covid19
4. Population control totally welcome come long quarantine 14 days. want coronavirus. ! RemindMe 6 months ""Do USA still exist"" Americans live country facts &amp; reality bent will, everything written pRoPagAnda en masse. 

So, no. always, information -- public can't/won't engage it. exactly fucking tragic. Even business, best deals *aren't* zero-sum games. best deals make parties stronger. Trump actively rejects kinds deals can't understand anything beyond ""if helps must losing"".

Pathetic. surprising deep-red S0uthern states much given consistent rankings education levels way vote.  spoken like someone TV Guide Economics Degree really. 

Gatherings general illegal, outside inside. could enforced better (some political parties held protests social distancing rules, really stopped), result spike luckily.

As mindset, I'm sure. People parties stuff like seen badly general public, gatherings 4-5 friends considered normal right Covid way contagious. ”customer” told leave store refuses trespassing too. showed meals still distributed needy kids. So, added concern problem really changed? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* ""Statewide, latest positivity rate new cases made available Florida Department Health, Saturday, 11.85%.""

Yet another lying ass news source. Probably. Let's see bail everyone half year.  lot people blindly shitting John Bel Edwards due headline. BTW he’s democrat don’t know. 

I’m Louisiana. JBE issued stay home orders March 22nd. 7th state places still crying “just flu, bro!” We’re currently state wide mask mandate 20 states still requirements masks. 

Yes, subject article seems silly. fully admit does. But, shit JBE like he’s done nothing patently false. He’s much top situation majority governors... especially southern governors. point people lost loved one virus. take seriously. one wants die. virus kill 99.5% people catch it. people working entire time without complaining. really need study say this? Thought common sense.  I'm far smart guy, see word ""study"" conjure visions guys gals lab coats glasses clipboards several pens each, reading data spending lot science medicinal monies. Great use said monies. Thanks, ask well!  Yeah mean wont go years. Even semi-effective vaccine helps lot. Google put ad networks platforms, platforms putting Google ads jn there. that's ads business. Instagram got Facebooks Ads. Reddit also got ads service. Herpes HIV retroviruses. DNA insert genome cells allowing persistent infection. 

This virus make infected cell zombie grows tentacles (filopedia) latch onto infect neighboring cells. suspect could allow infection survive neutralizing antibody response, since neutralizing antibodies nothing virus already infecting cell.

It follows would also also cause cytokine storms - immune system going apeshit neutralizing antibody response fails end infection. also probably restructure patients lungs significantly can. Probably effective either one alone. combo, mask would majority protective work. choice mask shield, mask vastly protective own. positive test rate Colorado like 7%. That’s well estimate positive test rate 5%. last time well 5% like month ago, schools finalizing plans. 

I’m teacher district announced five day in-person, district hasn’t announced changes plan. 

I’d feel lot safer pushed back start date, like districts done, wait positive test rate lowers. it, might take another month. 

Like could students start October end mid-July, end May. Students could month summer break come back mid-August, like normal. pray people don’t fuck us, somehow get testing contact tracing running. 

There’s good way start schools: kids’ learning going suffer matter what, I’d always favor plan would result lowest number deaths. Whatever takes. best argument I’ve heard can’t wear mask *really* don’t want public spaces.  people wear masks sick around others sick? sure I'm downvoted. thought pretty well-understood least cloth face covering may protect wearer, may keep wearer spreading virus others. live close damn rlly sucks No, actually, nowhere close. pop density philly 11k/sq.mi. pop density burlington 4k/sq.mi. rate, zombies. Zombies happen Woooooooooooooo paywall site “6- (severe level three, abdominal respiratory): Headache, loss smell, loss appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain.”

Not even half severe symptoms covers dealt with. tried pushing start illness wasn’t typical 3 symptoms CDC listed March.

I wonder neurological issues go away time or.... 

This good read though. I’m also CA, region? Every 60 seconds minute passes Africa. What's point? son 100% safety work. welds top large turbines. works high profile sites top notch welder. He's since young child. 
My ex husband (we still close communication) Superintendent Covid hit company, welded entire life. He's mid 50s now. (I married older man type thing.)

Neither mask. 
My ex occasionally goes bar.

Both refuse even discuss Covid can't wrap head around it.
My son also smack hot zone Texas.

I tried there's nothing else wait see if/when gets it. Yeah dumped first week stay home orders here. Lol, reddit people, income see quite time. benefits run end July, may living coming year longer know.

Moreover, pandemic, smart incentive stay home risk spreading virus. It'll cost long term deal widespread pandemic make sure people stay home pay bills without fear. still mask mandate? I'm Burlington area, stores signs stating masks required ""per local state laws"". Cuba well:

[""Cubans celebrate local transmission COVID-19 first time four bad:

[""Florida COVID cases surge fifth day Trump pledges outbreak coming I'd hope start getting armed security least start carrying store like skim see what's going on. told yesterday ""lockdowns spread covid"".  shared factual info person. doesnt invoke fear people wont post it./s guy defending pedophiles earlier? Babies would super spreaders passed around like used to. one year old jams fingers mouth, mouth whomever holding her, eyes ears nose orafice reach repeat antimaskers &amp; believe covid hoax shld wear medical alert bracelets state deny covid real virus Therefore 
If catch virus shld denied treatment since big hoax anyway,  fuck em. need treated . imho Agreed. people risk job stay home allotted sick time, change set expectations keep happening.

Personally think homeschool year, going back work office full time. hope employer continues flexible working remotely, already decided keep daughter anyway. newborn feel like, make ends meet husband's disability, risk it? many people can't that. foreigners perspective, Florida seems America's asshole. time passes, think chronic health issues recovered patients end bigger story deaths. ever doubt this? speak though Cush stay home job clearly remember hospitalized flu complications catching sick co worker. almost died giant medical bill took years pay off. coworker worked duration flu, knew it. Another worked right strep throat run sick days. Definitely. People need know worth US. always amazes see god everything, human actions take aid other. God's power incarnate, people good without promise heaven riches?

But no, unless claim good God's name, misguided.  I'm saying smart decision. Never did.

You might want try arguing I'm actually saying instead like saying. like shirt shoes service.

Doesn't say anything pants! \*starts unbuckling\* sad truth lot people never really wanted kids pressured one way another result willing play odds need free time.

Sure, ""love"" kids like family member cries loving another family member kill them. Agreed. Huh. People people. Weird needed study that. Ignorance lack decent public education mind control conservative media past 30 years. Lot people getting sick dying sheer stupidity Lake Ozark, MO, right (visiting 16-year-old daughter seen since February) . Barely masks social distancing. Bars full night. curbside grocery pickup relied Uber Eats. Dreading flying back San Jose tomorrow numbers peak: 552, 531, 511, 511, 489, 480, 481, 431, 432

To say increase 431 432 last two data points suggests increasing trend misleading. India may much worse I’m even sure tests reaching low income rural areas Maybe time go back Scotland Ireland move somewhere much north. summer time summer time supposed hot period. hate cold weather happens make live life. way feel favorite time year others theirs. take turns works out. wonder teachers want die.

I mean, doesn't? might mask mandate, people still wore masks regardless. Yes shit hit fan government stop it. private company bullshit. fuck wrong people? thrown jail cells throw keys volcano? People fucking suck man. Omg it’s weird! I’m British ... live US... 2 year old born here. country gives passport birth.... couldn’t care less gets US passport gets UK one also.
It’s almost like want install birth here, can’t believe nonsense goes school joke, gremlin somewhere Facebook, Reddit form social media saying complete seriousness 

(Is civil enough Reddit????) still infects people get vaccinated clueless you? Well that’s exactly government white people tax money west trajectory gradually better relations russia tbh makes lot sense should, lot english speaking russians culturally russia lot common europe, much china asia.

The whole ukraine thing, proxy war syria, election meddling, hacking, sanctions, oligarch sanctions soured things ruined timeline sadly

If people could get heads asses I'd happy removal russian sanctions creation kind political diplomacy normalcy possibility future alliance exchange stop hacking meddling, sides. I'm tired all.

edit: Well guys nationalist lunatic head ass. waste time. know russians like fortunately. New York literally placed CVD+ patients nursing homes risk death much much higher elderly.

There arguing smart decision. Try anywhere else, likely small spike deaths. filled joy anticipation Mom, content life job, celebrated birthday, water broke 30 weeks. Leaving hospital mother’s day without baby one worst days life. can’t people wear mask smh it’s hard, helps prevent virus spreading, it’s political statement. looked funny probably wanted one Cases viewed individually still anecdotal helpful opposed scientific research studies.

If multiple cases substantiated science like MIS-C was, that's different story. stores appointments 

A lot small places essential exactly this. could considered problematic. SHIT  Dude knows messed ... hill choosing die on. wish take Americans him. Imagine many people get flu shot year fear covid, misinformation. going get bad. accept vaccine body... manufactured current presidential administration. 


I know there's hardass attitude politics, head buried ass think politics leading factor fight COVID-19 United States. one superspreader, boy infected around hundred people school, two weeks later, 120 schools closed again.. 

The German government wants reopen schools without restrictions beginning September. expect second wave. Canada usually applaud rules one confused.

Show us way eat wearing mask. fucking course can. would make sense wouldn't? happen US. can't open schools. bail parents impacted financially. recourse. That’d actually considered good United States lmao  Got team monkeys working round clock this? freedom! would complaining front door wide enough lack handicapped parking  Western diet makes people look significantly older, agree.  specific allowances disabled people.

To add information here, can't wear mask, place still allow enter long offer ways shop. Say, curbside pickup, delivery, sort thing, let inside. even thing (wearing mask) dangerous others. reddit. Depends subreddit lurk. Stupid people everywhere. idea sacrifice entered conversation *at all*. true, make sure getting mask vents filters ones hole punches air exhaling still filtered. first couple weeks even think thought mask fine. last couple months I've using slide filters hole punches cover vents.

The vents keeping things little less warm humid letting breath go everywhere. seems lot people deny virus real thing would rather completely ignorant risk everything rather adjust habits schedules it. shut besides take mean people going remove masks eat drink wouldn’t make sense Yeah words NBA MLS players testing negative everyday artificially lowering state’s reported positivity rate son friends haven’t inside store since March. practice social distance outside play one two families, one time. kids haven’t congregating, you’re right.

Go on, I'll wait. shit Kids ages 4-12 going school full time ~6 weeks strong increase cases Reminder one singular Republican voted impeach, one two charges. Reminder Democrats delay deny witnesses chance speak. Reminder Trump Republican Anything agree fake news eh? sad privileged world live in. Hi, story tell, earlier February, got deathly sick week birthday, I'm American, time, idea COVID States, looking back, nearly unable anything frist days illness, early symptoms COVID, namely lack taste anything, food could bear eat cookies duration weeks, thats ate all. sure fucking hope so, mantra lately hold Summer 2021. poor people. really need armed bouncer outside check people enter. Even better veteran position obviously right. admire patience step-wise logic arrive way last remark. approach taken authorities stage pandemic, would controlled much easily. far much thinking along lines of, ""we proof hurt us."" Right. can't even get grown adults county act responsibility empathy. Asking undeveloped children seems pretty much asking trouble. Ah, sorry bout comment then. I’ve seen comments like completely serious. furthermore, fuck ""it proven one way another"" used evidence push re-opening. heard repeatedly. ""there evidence children driving this"" example - works. ""no evidence driving it"" still WOULD drive study. like he's saying ""We study shows DONT drive it"" he's saying study done yet. everyone like ""SEE, OPEN SCHOOL!"" 

like . wtf kind leadership that? insane.  worse now? article errors downplays asymptomatic presymtomatic spread. wouldn’t trust it. Bernie started Mayor VT. hard imagine place like VT could actually elect Repub governor??! Makes sense. got nice hippie dippie feel state. Ben Jerry, Phish, Bernie Sanders, Birkenstocks, nature lovers hiking lake mountain paths. Sort similar Pacific Northwest. Teachers grilled us citing wikipedia reason. Anything that's said taken pinch salt. KN95 absolutely effective. N95, hand, definitely higher. P100 highest. 5 median. Everyone still using 14 day quarantine exposure. That’s awful. state? district pays $125. made $167 long term interventionist.  fucking crazy lol.

Special treatment people based color skin definition. GTFO nonsense lol many places shortages tests masks, issues largely solved timeframe. global attention turns producing something, produced two months oh really? let change really quick closed slowly, specifically way handled nursing homes allowed ravaged. got unlucky, inevitable given population density international status city respect travel business. still fucked up, worse anywhere else earth lol. bill federal help. Science fits narrative != Science

And extremes Actually 1000 cases California (that include staff, parents children daycare) since March really astronomically high opinion. 

I’m actually shocked didn’t see spike childcare outbreaks 1100 YMCAs NY April. heard somewhere need two doses month apart possible I've got confused another one. required period immunity develop course! suppose. decade since I'd last gone Disney World, despite living way closer ever past. passes cheap! posted meme importance wearing masks community Facebook page. Someone actually said, “well post anti-liberal memes.” post way political, that’s way spun it. Another gov dumb ass exposed. what’s next? banana cost million dollars I'm disingenuous, dont to. 

You're low level troll, wont taking seriously.

Another ""alternative news source"" Russia reported pandemic deaths Italy common flu, Sometimes too. still here, you? waste time prevented death. You’ve got republican White House tweeted video dude saying white power shamelessly, endorsed it, nothing combat pandemic conveniently burdens kills poor minority classes.

Thats one example. 

Get yet? mean health insurance companies? make money taking premiums paying cover healthcare costs. wouldn’t chronic conditions resulting covid lead increased healthcare claims? short term they’re well they’re still taking premiums paying elective procedures. 

Alternatively suppose could make argument increased mortality elderly decrease costs road. That’s morbid hell. vaccine makes bad cold, happy. Link please  think special blood pressing concern always himself. makeup smear masks would wearing one time. hot currently ps saying masks filter air.

I saying trap particles minimize spread better respirator hole let's completely untreated air it.

Hopefully end like Ischgl February (that austrian skiing resort Hotspot believed

vote vote vote!  Ummm, shit. certainly appreciate beer choice. understand that, done issue? Unfortunately can’t tie someone inject vaccine them. vaccine almost certainly safe take, many clearly won’t believe it. I’ve seen sub. 

In terms myself? I’ll getting soon available. immune compromised due Chron’s. biggest concern - want family safe. going get clicks advertising dollars? Sources?   Geez trying nice reinforce we're team here. Lost mine amount coffee decreased. Used make 30 ounces weekend mornings finish it. 16 ounces want (although also probably get stomach checked) seemingly locked earlier didn’t testing capacity identify mild cases. Hell, weren’t even looking them. hit early also meant less time prepare inferior treatment protocols. Survival rates already much higher even absence confirmed drug treatments. terms total numbers, early lockdown probably much worse saw number cases southern states.

As California - don’t know enough what’s going there, definitely loosened restrictions, although extent — much people complying, don’t know.  think much fucking anymore. imagine she'd peg sense Donald. They're used hospital, sticking tube someone's throat ""areosoling procedure"" possibility fine mist spraying out.

Dentist offices, too, because, looking, everything aerosoling. serious question, treatment thats developed since New York spike. completely screwed up. 

I’ve dealing anxiety throughout life. It’s way worse now, pandemic parenting two young kids this. 

At work, incredibly stressful project amidst leadership transition. Everyone expected productive pretend like everything world fine. need vacation mental health break, can’t afford lose time.

I don’t really eat stressed; I’ve lost least 15 lbs. haven’t exercised much. fighting mild suicidal thoughts. concerned exposing vulnerable family members virus, would feel guilty actions caused one get sick. 

I keep telling need get next two three weeks. able take vacation mental health break. 

My thoughts everyone struggling this. comparing? USA fucked numbers won’t hidden medical profession still publish them. Case numbers can’t go don’t test them! Wrong. Try Yes. Maybe see bleeding always stops, eventually. Wikipedia untrusted source cite sources. went whole education without using Wikipedia marriage got little bit better due spending time together. Literally racist okay. 
 
Edit: thanks /u/mrflamingqueen ! coordinated responses written trained professionals state level would much expect. Well poll numbers collapsing antibodies either?

again, source, read it. 

Because get infected rate even though going school since May 11 keep social distance (1,5m) anymore. 

I'm sure link PDF, recent numbers.

We already know there’s immune response don’t know anything long. ok Missourian, agree. finds better fatefully hard argue one who's purposefully ignorant incapable making coherent points, probably should. least know testing sufficient control transmission 34 states. Best testing world? Maybe head buried sand since March.  republicans. Trumpsters. Republican governors like Alabama Louisiana issued mask mandates. Heck, correct I'm wrong, even Greg Abbott mandated masks Texas ridiculous thing I’ve seen day. populace becoming westernised. people VPNs. younger generation value parents governments ideals less less.

But companies going surrender it. They're expanding internationally, happy giving up. Property development massive generates huge returns, even tier 3 cities talking thousands dollars per square meter.

It one goals, that's set appear show thinking future, long success continued seen current set up, remain way. give fuck. give selfish fuck staying power. know chances re-election nil. know holding election rages control difficult impossible. know letting surge benefits politically. that's care about. lives, democracy. know Oxford publicly traded companies tied it? saw Astrazenica set deliver 400 mil doses vaccine, im thinking buying shares pre marktet tomorrow anticipation jump  Maybe saving lives important getting re-elected.   lot necessary commodities traded USD oil, forces faith currency. seem stuck idea inflation caused ""printing"" much currency. Also inflation necessarily bad thing thing. years higher lower overall stable.

Since adoption federal reserve banking system USD one stable currencies, tested time. global epidemic increased spending destroy USD. Although letting labor force go homeless starving could show world United States longer task handling global currency.

I think look past clue government financial downfall, current system fairly new completely different past ""empires"". also think know fall happen United States setting new standard look for.

As side note might benefit taking break social media bit. even worth discussing foaming mouth. good one. believe confusing N95 type, protective, slightly nicer N95 masks exhale valves. Exhale valves let air unfiltered. great woodworking keeps heat makes breathing easy, filtering intake, great covid protection others.

Most nice masks (including N100 worn drive covid testers area P100 wear costco, etc.) exhale valves. mask either tape shut wear second cloth/surgical mask top that. protect reducing risk others. also realize good portion (not all) Disney guests want ensure don’t get banned.

Still glad am. least biological hood work with. educate people virus real, threat health death real, masks social distancing necessary?

I’m disappointed wearing masks keeping social distance already common sense Asia Feb, many people today US (I don’t know countries — hope US arrogant country) believe COVID19 lie, big Boss puts 5G chip masks track everyone’s privacy, Bill Gates wants use vaccine control people. 

I’m ranting, seriously, could done help educate people? think mandatory vaccine schools, like mmr vaccine? would amazing. personally think flu vaccine mandatory school admission well. really, big part ir equator. big cities under, close enough winter like US. Alabama's coronavirus cases rise, something officials expect happening mid-July, education officials adapt quickly responding pressure parents teachers.

How could officials expect cases rise? Alabama didn’t much limit officials half Alabama’s 138 school districts rolled plans plan start school year. Nearly plans far give parents students choice traditional in-person school virtual school. mean still go camping oxford vaccine? anywhere read that? Yes!!!! Don’t get wrong alone awesome can’t wait meet friends. tbh think I’m going treat bit, maybe get nice spa day, tea tea house, even watch movie alone. Isolation got guess haha jk That's goal, likely happen. However talking what's happening now. future goals matter pandemic handled.

As right now, capitalism rife China there's restrictions, lot state involvement, there. There's Chinese stock market. Individuals businesses. Wealth accrued. fundamental points capitalism exist systems. Doomscrolling brings joy care admit. found reason live honestly bring smile eyes watching weak minded fools run around finally angry something, even energy focused wrong directions.

Run idiots run! wild need keep explaining almost August... we’re held account life led, would certainly worth brownie points. :) already posted 50 times week ago easier contact trace restaurant meal reservations bank cards used identify least may infected.

In US, contact tracing protest next impossible, particularly someone feels motivated lie contact tracer there. even someone honest would likely unable identify people nearby, making fruitless.

We assume inability US health agencies perform effective contact tracing means activity safe. Anything congregates together groups people hazard. Reddit get downvoted stating obvious truth... Excerpt: ""I'll repeat relevant expertise applying nonlinear mathematical models time-series data. But, alongside wife, still entrusted decision affect young people's lives. Using limited area expertise along comprehensive collection data, decided high school kids attending campus person fall, regardless precautions school administrators take requirements have. it."" Many vaccines, many different phases testing. Oxford phase 3, couple others (non American far tracker shows rumour mill going announce antibody t-cell response would good. equipment supplies subpar yes, country dirt poor. People risk dangerous ride US raft nothing. Aldi announced requiring masks. issue reporting system weekend, data abled entered. Maybe much bad news going around doom scroll. Seriously, searched ""good news"" yesterday got ""RECORD BREAKING COVID NUMBERS!""

So... there's good news then. Okay, good know. Harder expressionless they’re struggling Awesome. one near us (I could read them) know damn really worth  wish would require properly worn masks too. I’m sick seeing noses hanging masks. Defeats purpose. Ill keep wearing mask. Eventually mask deniers die virus. studied flu, linked. help.  Live DFW, confirm dumbest leaders. Would hope intelligence level indicative general population, smart enough realize isn’t.... Thanks I'm proud country managed I’ve resort news-free days devote time self. It’s big help. whisper great news, many idiots ready manipulate data order demonstrate covid protection tools exaggerated Interesting. I’ll read it. I’m used seeing things like political polls poll 1,000 error 3%. assumed “poll” 40 would error like 20%. Guess doesn’t work like that. go mall, dinner movie. would wonderful! know doesn’t directly answer question don’t source cite, current thought actually backwards original logic: virus may survive well heat outside, heat outside drives people inside air conditioning seems spread it.... summer actually increases spread bc people stay inside longer. Scheduled test soonest possible 8 days. Got test it’s another 8 days results given. 

Been 16 days since close contact restaurant kitchen tested positive. Still waiting results.

I feel bad contact tracer assigned case. 

I hour drive la county. Idk anyone else, NY resident making $500 week work, get $187 UI. enough rent like $75 rest month. Guess I'm gonna eating much. See that's gets me. keep changing rules response increases cases late stop damage done. proactive bit longer could get ahead it. IndiaTV pseudoscientific blog btw, although Oxford indeed releasing phase 1 results tomorrow. say safe, works. think residents simply see reality pandemic getting hit hard, acting accordingly. sizes mass graves see digging satellite imagery completely odds official death toll. already did. going participate, maybe dont lost conversation. people age less likely ""patients"" even get spread it. 

Why difficult understand? Yeah. Mine too. Hell time decide go Disney. know around 30,000 Americans die year ""just flu""? finally bury sword wouldn’t they? american feel like media ignoring oxford favor moderna. sure much faith put “india tv” previous demand india produce vaccine independence day. guess we’ll find agree completely still lot risks, primarily getting resort corridor (airplanes, road trips cities, etc.), comes recreational activities really feel everything make safe possible. Maybe try limit checking day? Wondering safer: Disney World public part Florida? personally vote someone clearly mental cognitive decline, especially since voting points align. best luck. virus gets love.. husband ""over this"", cranky masks, I'm high risk almost daily anxiety attacks, he's wearing masks without asked mostly humor me, think. 

I particularly care wears them, long keeps wearing them.  Anytime study treatment vaccine sizable portion start saying won’t work even data released. don’t want cure vaccine. want locked forever. city/country? 

I live Belgium near Antwerp. Belgium mostly reopened lot measures place. Masks mandatory supermarkets, bars/restaurants full capacity distance rules place, dancings/clubs still closed...

Nevertheless see spike cases though last week, worrying. school district offering different options based age - elementary would mix remote person different schedules per room keep social distancing. Middle school high school remote only.

However removed option large increase cases California. I've seen lot replies schools done that, awesome. Happy marriages end divorce.

The virus actually many people favor accelerating things may spent years discovering own. Yes, good point will. hope enough people join make unequivocal. realistic aspect conspiracy sites need worry money exist sow chaos.

There flag burning hoax two weeks ago people laughed at. follow yesterday guy behind entertainment.

Imagine people they're well funded. Long would mattered unfortunately... That’s accurate all. It’s socially distanced let disease infect others. agree point summer little disingenuous say Singapore got ""massacred"" they've 5 deaths per million people (making 138th ranked country measure). Sounds like happened Melbourne, thing mostly control. running rampant lock again. 

This thing hard control, soon restrictions eased cases start coming doesn’t take long start growing quickly. think due incubation period allowing presymptomatic people love community spreading virus. get wrong. would much like see vacinne. Maybe heard many hypes promisses already... really care vaccine protection reduction severity. still giving level immunity. said coronaviruses typically get lifetime immunity, even serves purpose safely familiarize immune system novel virus, reduces future severity percent hospitalized significantly decreased one left long-term effects, can't tell we're bad cold/flu corona - would great, honestly! Back June, opened dine restaurants bars people sitting inside eating drinking without masks, that’s happened. Yeah best plans seen give parents option keep kids home, I'm glad got that. agree, wish would keep home people would follow rules long enough get control. whole discussion would easier contained summer. doesn’t *have* to. depends point people start taking seriously responding accordingly.

Likewise, lot damage could Europe, people took seriously enough people, indeed potential super spreaders, haven’t exposed. true, shields help. There's mainstream PPE going prevent virus 100% effective. trying mitigate likely infection vectors, includes eyes. also helps stop people touching face. Recommended positivity rate &lt;5% control transmission. Many states even close that. Raw tests totals mean almost nothing. first point directly quoted saying modify deal liability issues people fuck shit up.

They also specifically say use valves mask situations dont want wear contaminating environment.

No idea science deniers thing filters work poke hole them. *Insert cliche common sense here.* BTW, could read next reported Covid-19 patients, scientists advise, “barely 1% 20 years age, age group accounts approximately 22% entire population”. safe Europe though?

whats reinfection bullshit??

Nobody said anything reinfection!! 

Cmon dammit CARES GO BACK SCHOOL permanent resident reasonably enjoyed stay US far, I'm eagerly waiting November.

If gets reelected, I'm selling place leaving (which guess wants, though may realize I'm immigrant since I'm white is).

If roughly half country (give take electoral colleges) votes again, hopeless. Sorry everyone else privilege packing leaving greener pasture. Still pay bills unfortunately. Guests stay require minimum 14 day stay. business government shown care. Aww, cute thinking cute. Everyone state knows uses term. 🙂 Soooo irrational. people think virus doesn’t even get ‘burned out’ fevers?? virus originated bats, able increase temperature super high, virus adapted give one damn heat Water isn’t wet makes things wet Meanwhile continue cut higher ed funding wife even know paid year.   really hate state. views deep state conspiracy-ish showing excess deaths usually good start. fact _something_ killing hundreds thousands people around world hard debate. people think part conspiracy though.

That aside, established something fact killed massive number people normal, ask causing covid.

Edit - here's article last month goes numbers different countries. Sources Nah people like dont vote period True.

Yea, amazing bad US always manages look next Cuba lol Yeah, think oddly specific want see peer-reviewed research paper public health researchers public health research question making claims data types researchers relying on?

You really think speak, outcome uncertain numbers telling story seems really bother far. 

""The numbers telling story! Oh, way, can't point credible research that's corroborating story. uneducated understanding research design."" tells Swiss idea what's going pandemic.

You ignore whatever telling that, Switzerland knocked daily new cases something like 90% high, active cases 94%.

They're dealing pandemic MUCH better US. must great parties. point women likely resting more, probably eating better food, less physical stress working shopping eating outside home. things would make early labor less likely start.

I know got idea things mentioned could stop labor progress delay delivery past normal gestation length. wasn’t hard me. saying human beings social creatures find totally understandable people find hard.

Examples people able say goodbye. Examples people long live anymore still can’t see other. People simply missing other.

So understand need lock saying also mental challenges consequences coming method. That’s lock almost always last resort like now.

People Alzheimer’s example, move way faster apparently seeing family helps slowing proces.

And many examples. simple google search would enough.

It used excuse ignore rules / guidelines (depending live). bit test backlog released last Sunday (120,000 test results) handful labs reporting daily. Today included 93,000 test results. similar first-time positivity rate (11.8% vs. 11.3%) last Sunday. kewl Yess shit. Well least sleep soundly knowing you’re charge anything. Wasn’t reason Russians wanted him? real? 


Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa teachers moms make medical experts. Listen scientists. listen politicians, movie stars, moms, teachers, preachers, etc.. Sadly, deaths caused COVID-19 SMALL part damage done. survive, even asymptomatic showing organ damage going long term effects. decade two fallout really appreciated. Regardless skin color, blood underneath red. Stop trolling already. NEVERMIND! THOUGHT!!!!! Study: Plandemic ends November 4th. main driving factor, would seen much worse outbreaks countries medical care paid taxes. didn’t. Please wait 2021. We're talking N95 masks here. reason said previous studies general public wearing masks focused whether protect wearer evidence mixed best.

Does help wearer? Maybe. There's anecdotal evidence like says so, never main reason masks. Researchers emphasize two main reasons wear masks. There's evidence protection wearer, stronger evidence masks protect others catching infection person wearing mask. 

And FWIW, CDC recommending face shields alone weeks, saying provide significant protection others. kids get 5 sick days year, anything else requires doctor note. many doctor notes still land truancy territory. 
If kid stomach bug, absolutely nothing dr visit them. run course. spend $$ time take them, spread virus kids there, get note school, use one 5 days hope 4 sick days year. 
We've dealt truancy issues lot years, one kid gets sick usually get it. even homebound learning couple months cover hospital stay + recovery time. kid goes school sick nurse decides send home, automatically excused. 

Then usual issues covering child care can't miss work, going dr can't afford it, catching make-up work missed days. 

The whole system rigged kids come school sick. Lol, we’ll nearing peak bankruptcy then, q dumbasses walking around guns everywhere, grandma dead, vegetarians days, trumps militant nationalist police disappearing dissidents every major city, Democrats blaming Bernie Sanders coasting senile old man’s loss general election. best case... worst case everything plus volcanos, San Andreas fault finally giving way 600 year wait South Park removed broadcasts episodes made November 20 March 2021 going get rid older teachers trying send back classroom (plus anyone sense). DeSantis already made attractive starting salary new teachers, make veteran teachers - totally replaceable aside teacher shortage FL. I'm obfuscating want know, Trump responsible supporters idiots right, left responsible idiots left? simple question. stop studies! virus disappear. throw full scale flu season, hospitals, already capacity many areas...this fall going harbinger death. Here's story: floated ICU help nurses, nurse myself. getting meds they're room helping Don/doff PPE, empty trash cans, restock.

Well, hour shift, nurse respiratory therapist (who visiting checking patients asked help turn patient. asked n-95 (oh yes, old whatever... already got virus /s).

When get room, teach we're going do. 

First, we'll lift person's chest high (this pt also 400lbs easy task). Then, RT going stuff pillows neck near chest offload pressure laying prone (on belly intubated). get pt high (us two nurses) RT goes change position neck lay opposite side face, hear *crack crack* . neck cracked, moved quite hours. intubation tube kinked throat oxygen saturation started going low low 80's (we want 90-92%). RT said we'll move back (their neck). lift move face back original position.

I exit room nurse says we'll try later charge nurse. 5 hours later, get opportunity RT, charge nurse. pt moved bed, neck moved little freely turned head still work! tube kinked throat time heart rate went 30's (normal 60-100) crash cart opened atropine given twice. Oxygen saturation 70's. Luckily, pt stabilized head position go back original one. charge said unfortunate, they're dealing another pt another ICU bay who's nose falling face (from pressure). 

Another pt told ""you maximum support give you. cannot anything else need try laying prone"". pt rather large belly uncomfortable laying it, course! last final effort body had, even maximum oxygen support, satting 88-90% we're probably going intubated night. 

That one shift ICU. nurses amazing. work another floor Covid patients. see full story patients transferred opened eyes. Unfortunately, getting push back able transfer pts higher levels care (IMC/ICU) they're full. ppl floor satting 89% 15L, can't go higher. patients prolonged low oxygen numbers, get hypoxic brain injuries issues low perfusion. Everyday anxiety producing.

Edit. nurse obese pt asked charge staff protocol patient code start CPR impossible turn without 6 people. answer wait 6 people outside room, wait everyone gowned ready go, get started turning compressions. realistically, that's probably 6-8 mins able help patient hoping efforts revive them. come Pacific Northwest take care aging parents. 99% people, it'd ok. mean that’s fair said gotta eat. Yes it’d fantastic got sick pay don’t, sometimes gotta make tough decisions.


Corona, said, different story.



And wasn’t talking sending kids school. sick stayed home think difference valved masks essentially breathing without mask exhale mask inhale. droplets arent caught valve like surgical mask otherwise. air itself, suspended aerosolized droplets. Texas 2 weeks away 2 weeks away 2 weeks away running hospital beds Well experience far unusual. Read comments post. dont know downvoted
Your right!










*Wink Wink* “common knowledge” isn’t accurate. It’s typical antibodies disappear completely within months. cells don’t make antibodies, B cells do. Yep. even worse narratives virus mutated less deadly, weve gotten good treating it, younger ppl dieing.

We may improved treating it, still killing ppl ppl survive issues.

Ppl think respiratory, is...but also attacks blood vessels hit organs too. I've heard autopsies find bunch blood clots. focus Coronvirus know itll significant greater impact flu season immediately  everyone internet pocket. hop facebook group 50,000 people back dumb opinion implementing quarantine international begin contact tracing still possible.

Unfortunately, techniques used since Plague little obscure government. p100 respirator downward pushing valve. internet checking agrees statement pushing plume (and water droplets) downward significant factor reducing viral transmission.

I also wear goggles (again) since spiking hit (again). Right. 

But state report (my guess know everyone access that) look dashboard get *only* new tests done day true-ish accounting new tests positivity. *socialist policy. socialism. understand things work. feeling could show bank statements still believe I'm wasting time. 

That said

You're right me. Wow, congrats rightest person ever!!! parents must proud. Yep. secondary infection vector allow infection persist face neutralizing antibody response, allows cells become infected without exposing virus ever exposed antibodies, since already attacked cell, using cell zombie spread neighboring cells. China largely capitalist though. think part what’s going there’s sort excitement gawking people- easily justifiably feel superior them. too...but it’s like, certain point need look away circus focus work needs done. gym requires masks lobby. That's it. I'm going. money put study like this? would make think spread effectively people? 1918 influenza change via recombination time endemic humans 1957, would created new pandemic flu virus. 2009 pandemic caused triple reassortment. 1957 1968 pandemics also caused antigenic shift. 1975 swine flu scare. common feature causes influenza pandemics seasonal influenza evolves.

And assuming I'm talking virus evolving become less lethal, I'm explicitly not. I'm talking partial T-cell immunity, know portion uninfected human population currently simply due cross reactivity seasonal coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2. partial immunity people born 1957 H1N1 pandemic 2009 strain another example. test covid+? wanted thank recognize civility. whole world needs lot this. one Youtube video nurse vlogged infection point died....RIP her. want see reality, maybe watch one. know really, unless someone stories share. assure also complete idiots, population politics. still political parties calling social distancing rules stupid people saying government pumping numbers (I'm kidding)... luck charge people listening scientists following advice, taking seriously talking large amount lives current situation so, no, exactly comparable. I've lived Houston. I'm kidding. 

Weather forecast says wet humid hell: can't close borders state level, cities communities decide close off.

In New Mexico, many cross border Gallup AZ. area along AZ/NM border Navajo Nation lives still hottest spot per capita nation. come across Gallup NM side.

The NM governor close border, able work city's mayor close city supplied troops help keep closed. let highway city unless official business.

They used number hotels segregate exposed, suspected, positive, recovering, patients go back families continue spread. rural, many cars, houses small, public health poor. working like hell stop spread. massive undertaking, appears working.

Honestly, one local dude early got serious was. single dude accord money drove tirelessly 16-20 hour days seven days week taking calls locals area thought might exposed shuttling around hotels try arrest spread. damn hero, hope see articles written point. “Reported”

Can imagine numbers messaged Bolsonaro control? Unfortunately isn’t handed fast enough times unintended recipient awarded. Canadian schools elementary high school (at least lived) stand attendance canadian national anthem. never sing it, failure comply would get shit teacher Trumpets didn’t know that? 🤣🤣  US population 330m, nearly 20,000 people fit category. Doesn’t seem infeasible me. case, worrying guess :/ 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! I'm pretty sure HC workers dealing lot grocery store workers. One life hands, wears loaded PPE every day try save people idiots wear masks. vented mask block/diffuse respiratory droplets well. anything, may cause travel stream concentrated vent. reason they're forbidden healthcare settings, sole purpose used dust mask construction. going find peer reviewed paper comparing respiratory droplets spread vented non-vented masks? No, really common sense. yes, droplets ""filtered"" even cloth mask, droplets make fabric. mask going completely block respiratory droplets spread, vented mask even make effort to. 

San Francisco's health order even allow vented masks used face part mommy daddy probably still pay insurance medical bills. reasons too, course, things get lot real anything involving doctors starts coming bank account. Found room. sad. Good luck millions losing insurance. german virologist made study smaller children supposing study based little data later criticized retracted still making, people misled media would completely negate study completely negated study argument opposite hypothesis, parents apparently don’t want care children 24/7 argument comes reopening schools,

Just wild guess insanity eradiating us infectous seems reinfection possible sounds like eerly accurate description answering question.


The Tl;dr:

Idiots common everywhere stupidity infectous, leads crosscontamination reinfections. UK european countries achieved without mask orders?  reality, immune system lot complicated “high school level shit” (and comment replied doesn’t even understand basics - cells don’t make antibodies). 

You’re immune system make response protects virus decades. make weak one lets get reinfected again. could make extreme response kills you. make response trains immune system ignore virus ever sees again. different responses involve components immune system, slight changes interact. ok. context I'm fairly lucky. dad 78 spent lot great time years. Tricor/fenofibrate typically prescribed high triglycerides (which cause liver damage) versus atorvastatin directed towards high LDL. Yeah wait till shit hits rural areas, gonna disaster, think NYC bad? hospital 2 doctors facilitating residents 100 mile radius. talking USA, far understand foreigner hardly hold sick worker. heard unusual get paid sick leave similar matters.

If people ought behave responsibly, society provide constitute required conditions incentives so. Well, must take BASE jumping. Depending age, actually safer Covid. also heard people survived jumping plane without parachute. Seems like fine sport lady. sure survive many jumps God decided call her. Great job, Italy! Yes, strange reason, five times number recorded deaths pneumonia flu year almost previous year. strange.

If anything, Covid19 death count low. remember reading interview early (April, maybe?) doctor said hospital allowed record death Covid19 unless patient tested confirmed infected, recorded pneumonia. Even doctors *knew* Covid. cheer whoever gets vaccine first long make available everyone regardless from.

You think United States going make vaccine available everybody? simply declare pandemic minute vaccine, start charging it. Unleashing virus world? confirm. started wearing dad’s shoes 4th grade one biggest kids class high school. Passed parents height weight 6th grade. didn’t even end particularly big dude 6’0 190. viruses behave same. can't access site, Europe largely geo-blocked news sites.

So they're adding negative antibody tests total diagnostic test count, discounting positive antibody tests count? actually would total testing done, less diagnostic tests deflates +ve rate. see saying, feel like wording post political comment. true news people age spread virus. wording imply people go school others. 

I think need make effort get younger kids schools higher priority older kids, think reasoning behind formative years importance structural in-person education. need lie act like older kids spread easier younger kids. kidding daycare bring home give whole family easy college student.

Just make sure understand I'm saying relationship also survive quarantine. come side. get R0 value disease less 1, becomes completely manageable there's limited impact wait vaccine. Masks would accomplish that. Unfortunately wont instantly effective we've let go hand putting mask orders place they're still place everywhere. irony legitimate tradesmen know wear mask danger. one welds without mask. anything beyond hospital workers, group wears masks profession.

These people pretending they're ""manly"" without one dumbass complains never gets rehired worksites contractor teams routinely ignores safety rules. 

No one wants die get fucked lazy.

The ole ""Dude, need tether up."" - ""Nah, Im good. slows I've never fallen before."" - ""Yeah, first time fall dead."" Damn didn’t think haha. people like scare got extra ? likely find people don’t like use paid sick leave days *actually* sick.

I worked manager would send anyone much coughed sneezed home people hated would go great lengths hide despite fact would absolutely pay missed days.

Where currently live work, people symptoms exposed coronavirus get apply immediately employment insurance via government benefits symptoms diagnosed COVID 19 etc (Canada) work also top salary lose nothing two weeks. still hear people hacking away awful cough on. Many still deny symptoms fever, cough, runny nose initial symptoms government online self-assessment five months ago don’t care dozens now. causing anxiety level work go roof; one wears mask act like contaminated based know behave work hours. eager things like “host party next month” someone things like like...uh, thanks. Whatever do, dont look [European countries US dealing totally different COVID-19. European COVID-19 uses metric system. virus actually act way small children older kids adults shit.... data exist. course can't.

This point I'm trying make. indication right reinfection short amount time even close common. That's article individual stories blow up. existing treatments talking about?

Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* dont say....

get flu shots people.....and pray. praying. correct answer indeed ""we know"".

We've seen examples reinfection. still know:

1. happen everyone, given chance.

2. second infection average better than, comparable to, worse first one. diseases find examples three, ""better than"" far common. German schools open since 2,000 school children teachers tested German state Saxony showed antibodies COVID-19, study found Monday, suggesting schools may play big role spreading virus feared.
Germany began need apps lots ppl using it. little I'm aware of. Yeah we'll see goes winter. maybe they're extremists funded CIA? watched live, starting wondering SNL trolling us along 4 year long skit. realized serious hoped dumbass followers actually would drink bleach remove voter pool rest us. elementary school kids? mean imposing several widespread lock downs part coherent national strategy dramatically reduced spread virus country, yes bad job. suspect many articles claiming numbers dropping statistics going straight white house. agree people misinterpret usage masks filter particulate catch. disagree youd want force droplets straight down, could directly handrail, table, surface thats spread risk store. Keep moist air 🤗 Working it! school sending home anyone (staff students) symptom anything. informally named ""holding tank"" anyone symptom held picked up, even means 3 pm. Kids symptoms immediately sent nurse sent back matter checkup provides. Anyone tried bring OTC meds sent immediately. Anyone complains tummy ache puked night - same.

But school long. I'll shocked make end September. glad  realize people going think I'm attacking them, understand situation sucks everybody, started side discussion based person lady ask could send kid back school ""ruining family."" people strong ill towards  Medical types like call n95 type masks respirators - always made think powered thing - anyway, that's meant since mentioned valved n95s.

Personally, think wearing *only* one shitty masks - e.g. surgical cloth type - foolish. had, just.. go public. Privilege ftw guess. level protection provide shitty. Yes, shitty protection beats protection. maybe, *maybe* enough help significantly population level - though think U.S. probably well past point even universal masking (assuming shitty masks) would actually put end ongoing spread. 

But case, main point previous post wearing n95 air leaking around sides, fit you. can, concerned actually getting decent level protection yourself, try makes/models find one fit. Ideally would actual fit test. half-face type masks cartridge filters tend achieve good fit wider range faces compared disposable ones. go back. life isn’t worth it. always find another teaching job future. support system try find remote work possible. Water wet hobby correct people idea they're talking about.

I'm formally educated causal research in, advanced degree took courses observational research design causal research.

I doubt hobby talk things clearly educated never two countries, states, cities make comparison meet criteria ""highly similar."" 

So halfwit's suggestion is, there's way form valid counterfactual, make conclusions based clearly invalid counterfactual.

Well, that's pretty stupid.

Maybe instead use heads think would happened New York followed Swedish approach given understanding virus, transmits, who's at-risk, New York's demographics population density.

It's pretty useful use head think things, know? similar"" extremely subjective who's qualified say data similar enough

The researchers develop literature it, dolt. Honestly, rule allows landlords impose strict no-visitors rule (that actually enforced) non-compliance grounds eviction would go long way curb behavior real quarantine active. would kind order since ultimately judge final say someone evicted (and laws vary state state), get idea.  don’t want take risk teach distance learning find another job. schools essential kids must go back school possible. Teachers know Check documentary Freakonomics cover school amazing results. shit Sherlock. ignore hoax results....

Why dudes even getting tested don’t believe virus? Man, gotta yuck someone else’s yum? ain’t jam, jam ain’t someone else’s jam, jam ain’t everyone else’s jam necessarily, etc etc. long everyone consenting good time, where’s issue?

There’s million insulting words English language - get creative! Irrespective blame generation. There's bunch people coming age likely die virus put plans hold keep everyone else safe? There's bunch busting gut get wing parents parents abusive ramps urgency. going happen unrealistic us expect them.  
A significant percentage young people quite simply limited reasons obey lockdown protocols. Lol wonder long gonna take realise reading replies since first breakdown lol. Show numbers idiot  two main branches Satanism; LeVeyan satanism/church Satan Satanic Temple. Neither one believes worships Satan being. use symbol Satan light bringer represent choosing knowledge dogma. Satanic Temple mainly activist organization personal religious freedom. Except whole let’s send covid patients back nursing homes thing. NYC done shit ton things right, fucked royally nursing homes killed lot people

I like Fauci, dude lives create sound bites lately Saturday's report always lower Fridays. Take last week week weeks always follow sharp curve corresponding lab's workweek. live? new symptoms would coincidence? currently work place general manager like this, convinced take ibuprofen come 12 hour shift full blown case flu, fever shakes everything. high intensity fast paced fast food job, terrible idea really sucked. ever call reason, even 12+ hour notice, (the management general) act like don’t believe me, make point mention short bad I’m fucking them, demand doctors note, even sometimes punish reducing hours next week even doctors note.
My job shit hope isn’t typical, management stopped caring covid even April, give us masks now. still try convince us come try call out, roughly 1/100 people city confirmed case covid, it’s really matter time everyone there, whole lot customers, catches this. Shits fucked.  Elementary school 5-11 :O thank god Death increases lag infection rates 2-4 weeks, that's long takes die get infected... can't argue stupidity. cheap ass mofo. 20 bucks?? Take 20 shove sun don’t sine! Stop spreading bullshit. Jeez, even trying up-play it. Scary stuffs. wedding photographer, 2 weddings yet cancel october december. fucking nightmare.  that's remember. room, last meal. remember anything else. Apparently, made calls sent texts family spoke doctor sedated can't remember that. Three-and-a-half weeks later, woke intensive care. 

Christ, last time heard someone blacking Corona lime involved I'm 'here' want trade places I'd happy to. plenty tweets, Google ""Herman Cain"", news stories two weeks. think there'd least couple he'd made public appearance hospitalized virus.

He could totally fine, could also quite ill. 

With things going though, write possibility GOP staffer ghost-tweeting weeks death Herman Cain. sounds like Trump press conference. would bring back school? know Florida, places recalling elected official involves in-person gathering ton signatures get moving first place.

EDIT: Florida, Governor cannot recalled. vote in, live next election apparently.   Volunteering vaccine trials good really hope don’t test people prison people low income communities forcefully fear DeSantis Agreed. see one talks about/remembers executive order governor requiring nursing home facilities take back confirmed covid positive patients. never closed public transportation, start disinfecting trains overnight late-april, iirc. close 30k deaths kind success? death rate anything applaud? don’t believe you. America full stupid people. That’s Reddit tells me. don’t 10% prevalence. Would actually great news would mean much lower IFR feared. 

There much bias noise data. desperately need prevalence tracking modeling randomized testing good quality data control don’t it. Anyone know rule change white house control numbers affect way worldometer gets data? mean also know people head sand rude awakening  life death. Young healthy people (who even fit heatlh conditions) virus still worse health recovering. would want get sick anyway? hate sick can't enjoy properly anyway. really dumb. 

Also maybe they're trying manipulate young people force actually protect people vulnerable. Since young people tend narcissistic anyway want something sake caring someone else. Yeh I’m suggesting context framework like California. think need 5% positive rate 

Our school leaned open support Republican shocked obvious consequences ignorance population part live gated communities, locking fairly straightforward live smaller town NC thrives tourism. last week every hike I’ve 80% state cars, well downtown area. one wears masks (I do, obviously), whether hikes downtown. It’s fucking selfish come tourist small town right even wear mask. hate all. god can't anymore people. damn copy paste Facebook argument numbers blown deaths covid related. Ignorance bliss guess. think that, every time go store house there's least one person wearing mask mean I’m bit hyperbolic it’s really lens view makes sense RemindMe! 1 day Thank sharing even read reply replied to? Today highest Saturday record. irony? excuses forcing senior centers take sick seniors spread disease literally vulnerable population possible? really needs light shone it, NY mandated policy explicitly killed people. Yeah forgotten shortly another breaking story Iraq finest standup people ever pleasure meeting. Starting think best brightest don’t go politics. fair testing doesn’t make go away either. always felt fixation testing, possible catch ever case corona contain it. Containment never really possible country like US. hotspot? Probably bad idea depends live. reading article Trump debating Congress much money CDC needs title implies trying defund CDC testing. Also, CDC given raise lying. caught lying COVID 19 cases 2 whistleblowers saw articles Trump want give raises dishonest organization makes sense. Somebody told tonight lockdowns spread it. mask protects people sickness. respirator protects people's viruses. #JUST LIKE TRUMPS WIENER!! ugh, say that, they're colossal dickheads. grew pretty rural place VT, end clearly marked dead end road, amount people every fall would park driveway get start taking pictures yard surreal Imagine entire continent 363 new cases. Yes - isolate know sure almost like virus spreads like a... Virus Tough spot in. I'm sorry :/

Edit: I'm reading person who's wearing mask owner company. sure that's right. notice people often using CDC stats proof deaths going realizing deaths often backdated. Since take two months deaths added, one week number seems always look low. made wedge issue. works. Find issue. Take rediculous stance make huge issue. false bravado mistaken many confidence intelligence. Boom. Ratings go up. real iq showing shit work people start dying. Trump Kemp done. Masks don’t prevent getting it. spreading it. get “thrown jail” here; actually working legal system doesn’t cater whims bias local officials.  ""Flattening curve"" time machine sorts.

So many people saying nothing, let virus run course, stay. Well mask one example buying time useful. 

Other reasons better availability hand sanitisers, time people develop good habits, better testing tech, course vaccine (if happens). stands maskless know what's scary: morons actually BELIEVE say act like do. Hang there! Took 11 weeks get it. actually read study? tested patients felt sick - children aged 10-19 tested symptoms rare. Look breakdown brought COVID families - 57/10,592 age 0-9 (.005%) 231 age 10-19 supports real world data we've seen thus far (e.g., Sweden) children rarely symptoms thus, rarely transmit. smaller scale studies conducted Europe followed asymptomatic children tested positive - see transmission. Yep, I'm trying pretend like smart know things. trying start discussion new ideas instead 2 opinions echo chamber. him. many people government also governors mayors also too. Trump worst offender. Sucks hovering 10% death rate per day vs new cases per day weeks now. 

Even though numbers lower still loosing 150 people per week. article yesterday, info today.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH lol, dumb. last time, masks stop getting it, prevents spreading it. That's anti-maskers dangerous. guys, virus SMELL FEAR, CHILL OUT, duh dude dumber would need watered twice week. leave biggest turd Biden. Bill Barr would like word, unmarked van cried eyes Italy seeing 900 deaths per day... need vote confidence whatever needed get rid desantis. would certainty contagious times. lack data research particular situations moment. know anything certain situations saying things like dangerous misinformation there. tbf Kemp idiot right would surprised see contract virus shit he's pulling. poppy bush administration basically [gave sadaam invade kuwait, attacked did.

i want autobot know corona covid-19 nothing however. Well guess virus made pretty piss poor quality.

Could incubation period month fatality rate 90%. Added gruesome death like Ebola. house burns down?

If get corona, promise I'm staying house entire isolation period.

Edit: downvote circlejerks find this, I'd still avoiding people. reasonable ask somebody perfectly isolate long periods time. disagreement change fact. least protect **ourselves** rightwingnuts fighting keep people wearing masks, distancing, taking precautions.  Simultaneously laughing ass dying inside, watching Wallace hold print interview President United States, knows kind ‘in face’ proof necessary get semblance honest answer. Agree [This shows hospitalizations Arizona declining steadily since end June. lag reporting data almost 3 weeks now. data different yours? opinion (which downvoted sure): use N95 valve. Better protect infected (a N95 much better surgical things) reduce risk spreading got it. get infected, also can't spread virus.

Good bars supposed closed Texas, lot restaurants bar areas allowed open. I’m nurse NYC don’t think hospitals even upstate (way upstate) would want take bunch NYC covid patients put communities risk.

So say nursing homes  “Come hospital see, take mask know” Vegas fun place another reason go Vegas. However, would zero chance would choose vacation destination. could see driving occasionally couple hours away. recent reporting Friday Thursday’s processing, almost 62k pending results. positive testing 20%, additional 12k cases yet reported lab(s). vaccine available world wide uk? would elitist one backgrounds families. lived MO life yes, FL epitome could afford travel mother's paycheck back late 90s took year two save for.. back travel agencies bigger thing internet exist now.

Pandemic Race full swing, don’t think anyone cares Olympics right now.

Food probably requires separate license. awesome news, I'm thrilled hear could bandaid vaccine rolled out, here's worry: President Sphincter decided hydroxychloroquine miracle cure virus, screwed people already things like lupus.

If medicine approved use COVID-19, I'm concerned HIV patients lose access it. need figure good way screw over. Yes, AIDS airborne contagion. must physical contact blood transfusion. treatment AIDS well. downplaying horrors AIDS epidemic beginning one knew transmitted. terrible. People deny existence though. quite different. Trying best embrace absurdity point much resources take add question? fairly neutral article source explains whole issue White House wanting COVID-19 data released public CDC want info first? 

My personal bias horrible government directly involved releasing scientific data public. understand bias, seek find somewhat neutral article this. doubt anything perfectly neutral anyway. Thanks! like government $600. government paying $50k/year basically retire permanent vacation, much would make give work McDonald's? even consider less 100k/year. point valved mask still worse nonvalved variant.

Why purposefully something less correct stakes high payoff? Wait, going hold Japan bastion healthy work culture? read judged you.

You obviously read article obviously responded bad faith. everything clear.

You're simple person. see right boy I’m arguing potency virus? side effects/physical damages? sure needed retort serious question. I’m genuinely trying gauge severity ICU rate you’ve stated relative key points. mask social distancing currently norm. parent young kids, would never, ever intentionally send school sick. one thing, shitty thing school, another, like home me. fun like them, let baby sick days. even think chance might exaggerating ""symptoms"", err side caution. Even flat need mental health day while, take it.

But even then, sometimes really seem anywhere close actually feeling well. fever, redness throat, unable give specific symptom. encourage go school, since enjoy it, go. sometimes end actually sick school. heartbreaking mortifying.

So yes, people might intentionally send sick kids school. going countless parents convinced child fine sending sick child school year, matter vigilant screening symptoms.  Please safe INJECT SHIT VEINS! I’m debating existence protests. live here. I’m saying makes sense put resources towards restaurants. Yes obviously breathable masks worse protection, I’m pointing aren’t necessarily uncomfortable. There’s plenty comfortable polyester masks there. Well point could potentially exposed coronavirus Hundreds thousands dead economic turmoil. Meanwhile president's pressing concern right. Wow.  I'm hoping US government try prevent vaccine reaching (poor) Americans US vaccine Trump investment ties ""close"" ready. body remembers antibodies make get reinfected. Immunity technically means increased resistance, properly recall. manage catch again, less severe. People Pennsylvania freaking bc governor put restrictions state...many saying like cold conspiracy.

Many places cancel fireworks. And...I saw fireworks year ever before. number subtracting everyone previously tested negative

I thought number simply *including* everyone previously tested positive? isn’t subtracting anyone takes total new tests denominator.  experience park next zero lines without deal fast passes?

It even better going peak season 90s. Asymptomatic people. free come super accurate mathematical model predict cases future lockdown implemented. 

Remember supposed reach 200,000-1,300,000 cases begining May. due lockdown reached 30,000 cases around begining May. tell whether lockdown dumb not. Also, face explosive growth gave us time prepare. wholesale mass murder point. suggesting bad idea, ""contact tracing"".

That kind contact tracing would useful South Korea, pull phone bank records use CCTV track people; identify strangers infected. US, going much good.

In case, anyone congregates close quarters others 15 minutes self-quarantining, matter what.  course, folks believe special standards applied them. Shocked tell you... absolutely shocked... 

Just like report came yesterday showed states closed schools earlier fewer deaths. would’ve guessed. 

I guess glad scientific research back common sense, people who’ve ignoring common sense think scientists make things make Trump look bad, sure research convince them. Sounds wonderful. Tween short “in between” lol. refers specific age group. like toddler infant. kids lets know age group.  Anyone child school child school knows easy get sick school year highlighted fake relationships lives. find people life give two shits make feel, cut life. Absolutely, big If. Probably they're less likely get seriously ill. mean can't transmit it, people weird. think TL:DR tiny lungs spread less. High schoolers adult sized regard. education feels like prepares better college,

For personally disagree completely. Going class gives motivation listen depending teacher helps too. I'm also competitive competition smartest least top 10% grade wise helps me. feel accountability online, people ZERO issues online good them. can't :/ Luckily small minority. Risk groups vaccination coverage 95% year, lot people outside risk groups also got shot. Sweden 2nd highest rate people negative view China world, Japan.

So honestly, Sinophobia general sense ""we cant chinese did"" guess. It’s ridiculous even question.  ...anymore... Ah. Im sure thatll help solution preventative reactive otherwise theyll always behind. horrible. high temps last month. Hard breathe one sure. buy $2 face shield. governors make mandatory /r/dankmemes downplayed called flu. friendly reminder !! parents cobbled together *temporary* system can't rely long term. summer prove parents stay home work. people relying family members who, willing provide free childcare last months, either can't agree year onward. (A lot times older family members working, may may energy keep may already offer questionable supervision...) taken temporary leave work faking work understanding bosses look way...but that's temporary. Protected leave lasts 12 weeks. *eventually* even understanding bosses going stop paying employee that's actually spending work days guiding children's remote learning instead job.

Parents nothing bad options right now. They're chomping bit send kids dangerous situation. They're balancing fatality rate children likelihood unemployment homelessness.  Keeping schools closed solves problem teachers reduces spread, solve *all* problems.  parents still stuck choosing dangerous options kids. parents really want *safe* option still lets keep jobs. Ideally, *everything* would shut unemployment payments would go again. I'd love could take 12 weeks protected leave feel confident would actually worth time...Instead we've blown last 5 months. mean, passes stage 3 great success, gets accepted, would biggest news century.

All worry production distribution, much easier creating new vaccine. Novel / Nävəl / *noun*

The last times media(and “president”) reported drug potential COVID treatment, people trying get hands it. happened hydroxychloroquine famotidine. Walgreens weeks ago people hoarded Pepcid since report doctor NYC gave patients IV famotidine ICU. Face shields provide small amount eye protection. keep reposting exact comment multiple threads?

You're bad fox news dude. posted almost exact comment Israeli doctor reinfected thread. 

Yes, antibodies last longer months. 

That's normal. happens things covid.

We long-term immune functions periods longer months. cells/memory cells ""learn"" make antibodies fight future infections. 

Once these, exposed covid (or something else) again, body makes antibodies. 

Stop trying scare people sake karma farming Son's weight 24 Actions consequences. Nice that’s becoming thing again. forgot people south stay indoors central air conditioning summer. Sure, real number probably 30-50% higher. So, huge underestimate, that's probably typical around world, yeah real number definitely higher. excess death numbers analyzed we'll accurate estimate.  Someone know High School 5 states since things opening back up. Illinois Iowa Kentucky Tennessee Georgia. Iowa Georgia last 5 days. makes sick shit spreads faster faster. 

My sister living LA hand responsible basically said fly back Iowa visit parents see-able future. medic response teams. Young, professional, stress resistent guys help. point is, sites say BLM cause spikes, gathering anti maskers did. Now, idiot would say...well anti maskers wearing masks that's spread. idiots fail realize even though people wearing masks BLM protests, could literally count one BLM picture people wearing masks entire number people anti mask rally.

That's fake news side it. straw man built. really. There's enough data suspect virus attacks cells. research accuse others misinformation. Also weak cd147 binding observed experiment. 

Oh everything virus misinfo right? posted asymptomatic/airborne transmission Feb downvoted. happening reinfection/relapse idea. yeah, come back comment months see spreading misinformation. too. height anxiety early, know much. science starts understand this, less anxious feel. data have, action take protect myself. People hate comment live Ontario premier conservative - Doug Ford. point even compared Trump. liberal, acknowledge actions fight pandemic province effective.

I think Covid19 lackluster response uniquely US far right countries phenomenon. also science denial, felt right left. Also whats last lines comments? honestly think things like ""stay school"" ""grow up"" mic drop worthy. ain't TV show dear. Really? link that? That’s fantastic hear. Perfect example. Thanks, Biden! point initial finding young kids less likely transmit. 

But that's found. find test that. see pursed lips disapproval mask. furrowed brow probably communicated lot. it’s easier us stay away stores lot anti-maskers. Target, Walmart, local chain grocery store going stores have. avoid thus avoid anti-maskers. Mine valve thick AF filter it. I've checked multiple times can't feel air go valve. mine fall category dangerous? show source spreading this? revolution pages anyone direct to? think time somehow join together fight back. government longer serves people. scares me. rally almost month ago it’s taking long show positive, makes worse. fully understand could’ve infected sometime many unknowns still it’s scary. There’s also extremely high chance successful monoclonal antibody treatment soon bridge gap Masks whole lot easier find cheaper face shields. even sitting purchase. employees inside masks, face shields. greeters chose put on. believe see last restrictions, including social distancing, gone forever.

POTUS us. Yes schools important, even go back person restrictions keep everyone even close ""safe"" going take away important parts schooling anyway. People spread outside. Like, what? Ending quarantine shit leads HUGE masses people close together public lmao. way worse handful less people house wording, absolutely cannot disagree. I'm 60 children blessed grandchildren. 60 years age get wrong thought knew love younger. parents always said person really learn love grandchildren. found true. granddaughters wrapped around papa's little finger love it. 

One children letting child go school take classes online. dont know. wish child send child back school. There's enough meme papa help need team up. children future right simply know enough virus make intelligent decision. 

In opinion risking future America word POTUS disregards agencies country whose job keep Americans safe. People like Epidemiology professionals, immunization &amp; infectious disease professionals CDC's recommended guidelines opening schools rejected. Why? supposedly costly.

 CDC &amp; Dr. Redfield redrawing guidelines suit POTUS. Well thats exactly POTUS CDC drew guidelines re-open economy course disregarded. look mess lives cost America. children, grandchildren, teachers everyone housekeeping crew School Board line fire virus. 

When reopening schools cannot afford let anyone guinea pig. forget loss life President already cost nation. Please forget school districts private schools wealthy schools. afford disinfectant strobe lights cost tens thousands dollars. also money infrared body temperature screening. even afford swab someone test kit give results 5 minutes. 

 technology available schools busses anything children school personnel touch. reason given why
some children can't absolutely unacceptable period end story. one &amp; one. POTUS wants open schools let show media let media follow child Barron classmates school month first. feels strongly safe prove us. go exposing families environment. 

that help disinfecting technology marched BLM demonstration 8k people masks. city high infection rate Ontario. stipulated masks must warn. outbreak. That's throughly believed covering face stop spread virus Haha really solidifying position top guy.

I’m sorry thinking AZ would know open schools pandemic died lot.  Japan cars

Weren't good initially. takes time build stuff levels destruction different industries 90s different. Car production good even USSR era (for different reasons) sold europeans, way good Btw, love asking people proof scientific evidence much. bring least one support position?

Burden proof make claims. That's basis critical thinking - believe something people claim unless proven.

But people inclined believe nonsense Russia long negative. point. ok. people live paycheck paycheck family dependent them, put blame lack generous sick leave low paying jobs. People work hard fear homelessness get sick work. risked termination many jobs around here. 50,000. maybe equal number adults. enough barely make blip economy. Plus, people social security Medicaid likely die, cutting ""dead wood"" speak. win around long stop care human life. necessarily. lot NY’s problems involved retirement homes. FL won’t necessarily see high death rate NY NJ. states possibly hit harder population density things like subways buses may meant higher viral loads. 

Also, lot testing, pick lot asymptomatic mild cases March, thereby dropping fatality rate. Also, FL skewing younger. 

If FL senior communities start get hit, quite ugly indeed. It’s already plenty ugly. 

Treatments somewhat better now. Let’s hope best. 

I imagine DeSantis capitulate mandate masks point soon. Let’s see data week. think people probably starting self-protect. Yet gathering 100 people doomed entire states. Got it. I'll stay house another year thanks! Oh innumerable questions even asked. 

For example, think going lifetime effect mental health well children several teachers die? orphaned?

What suspect ones brought home virus killed dad?  

Everyone seems speculating happen children go school, whereas one considering happen do. thought virus id checker everyday citizens even getting retested see reinfected? sucked prepared every meal since March.

There's middle ground takeout twice week.

There dishes transport better others. experience, etc, etc. also nice get something different cook every while. Plenty small businesses support. tests accuracy certain time period, days. think right around time symptoms first felt, every day someone say something different. assume everybody else it... kidding Username

But agree, we'll see guess. study figure out? virus.. wish districts would follow suit. get control.

They taking 109 new cases seriously.


Arizona slightly lower population recorded 147 Covid19 deaths yesterday. may consider asking people may sick consider wearing mask starting Aug 1st, figure way offend Karen Bubba. Local Arizona law enforcement may consider suggesting request people see wearing masks busy pulling people 71 70, harassing kids joint, guarding local donut shop. take word - scientists TWIV say. 

Also, unfortunate reality mean raise doubt - logical. Source this? saying don’t believe you, I’m active NFL fan I’ve heard nothing this. Yep, mean, main focus vaccinating risk groups, high vectors spread, like doctors, nurses, teachers maybe. 

Once get groups vaccinated, deaths, spread hopefully get lot better. get rest population control, get herd immunity. makes fucking angry. 

I'm fucking moving Canada Germany shit, country full lost causes I'm tired care anymore. used proud American, fucking embarrassing. Yeah also lived there, cheers you. continue push Chinese government adhere Marxist principles. 

I much better chance convincing imperialist shitheads.

Nice try trying pretend first-year political science student though. Made laugh. # way?!?!? Besides, relatives! Consider bereaved people blood/marriage relatives!

&amp;#x200B;

And now, often do, find wondering Black Death plagues, famines, etc. Ignorance... surprising mask related hospitalizations getting news coverage?

Oh wait, bad, probably fucking any. Thats lovely, think would happen Bill Gates endorsed him? Exactly popped mind too.

Why many people take selfies front seat car? use profile pics? don’t think I’ve taken pic car, ever, don’t understand compulsion. Ya stay home &amp; conserve finite amount battery charge I’m teacher. called sick spending night vomiting high temperature head teacher told take paracetamol lunchtime! mental probably people March parroted ""China lied us!"". 

Now whole situation exist hoax ?? dumb, spread virus effectively adults? still people right? Nice, coffins pretty dark. save much money paint black. would involve losing, though, narcissist can't stand that. 

His brain go far ""Testing = higher numbers reported cases = states shutting = wrecked economy = low poll numbers = probably lose election."" Nothing else important him. He's narcissist, needs supply, winning reelection get supply. help little, every drop inhale reduces chances infected, well reducing viral load receive. 

Though main benefit control spreading, say... spreading whoever gave Stitt, Stitt.

Which means hanging around mask-positive company created pro-masking state, probably contract it. don’t think able detect means survives, particularly point infectious. scientist, saying don’t think able detect “live”, infectious virus. white house? thing Drump cares getting re-elected. Allowing virus run rampant obliterate minority communities takes enough focus deploy stormtroopers every major city suppress voting. actions make perfect sense admit stop nothing avoid prison.  thought Americans knew already Snowden. guess not. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Shhhh. can’t give away secrets..

Also don’t forget top notch craft beer scene. appreciate connection post made 5G availability heightened coronavirus risk through, mentioned 5G deployed dense urban areas right now, *also* tend greater risk transmission.

Of course, 5G isn’t *causing* COVID slightest; simply correlation ≠ causation fallacy action! work place who's corporate headquarters biggest footprint FL requiring masks. work WinnDixie AL legit business I've heard come recent days saying require mask customers. (Associates required to) blows mind publix, walmart, cvs everyone retailer know requiring masks. way rationalize maybe want shoppers refuse wear mask, though population can't bigger pro mask population it? mean there’s tests there’s cases.... That’s works right? There’s way virus goes away US winter. There’s going wave wave years come. US completely botched laughing stock world. Even Biden wins November won’t help, US healthcare system nightmare Biden won’t nearly enough fix. China handled virus better America freaking started there. US going permanently weakened.  fuck, fasting?

Next step would crier walk streets ringing bell yelling ""Plague! Plague! righteous cleansing punish man lust vanity! Oh, swing scythe angry God. Repent! Repent! Repent!"" imagine? Nah doesn’t even make sense logic. pandemic worse doesn’t help minimize it. Right covid cases surge plan stop funding testing. mean there’s tests, there’s cases, right? Problem wearing masks make coronavirus visual problem. Visual problems make people worry worry bad economy. didnt support masks.  Medicine resident - confirm. hospital run remdesivir, we’re sure next shipment coming in. least dexamethasone shown reduce mortality readily available now. Better safe dead kinda divided. There's bunch countries virus going down, like European countries, there's also lot countries virus still ramping up, like India, Africa South America get this. Trump better suited deal Hilary would been. Mitch McConnell going try knee cap Trump way would Hilary. Trump also seen incompetent. Stepping back letting experts run show would easily reelection he'd gone Regan like figure. Instead he's settled strategy workout him. truly understand purposely chose screw up.

It's him. Republicans. They're aides, lets dictate messy issues, they're genuinely bad responding crises. look 53 Republicans vote House bill back May, send back amendments, make bill. Make ""laundry"" list send back down, come agreement... something! no. just... suck. Reagan thing HIV epidemic.

Less capacity test less resources then. bet NYC closer 80k day peak, near enough tests go around. think panic would help us tbh. many people taking seriously. Keep hacking.... come on, man. show proof please. need blame China everything hide owm incompetence. help us slow spread virus. also protects directly, much nearly much prevents spreading. opposite China.

From end January, young people 20s 30s persuade older people wear masks, instead older people even dismissive some

Then everyone put masks mainstream media covered authoritatively. worries. get looked like point view 
I regret that. Vermont leadership White House impeached. senate chose jot remove It’s little harder bullshit Reddit Facebook. People like see receipts.

Also, read article?  UCP power now, absolutely. want NDP back. NYC heart set reopening schools fall.

I really think looking smart time Thanksgiving rolls around. I've lived whole life, stop making us look bad? Archive please? mask protects you. behind ""research heard about."" hear recent research, [like 

We're experiencing biggest crisis decades right now, behooves stay date stuff.  140,000 *dead* surreal think about. 140,000 fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, friends, neighbors, teachers, cousins, etc. gone, idiotic leadership country  r/nottheonion “That spurred agencies look new ways China, Russia nations using range platforms spread disinformation pandemic, said.”

Oh well, absolves responsibilities dealing it. come nature, must real.

You think China accidentally/deliberately releases virus want, really fail see logic make US try even harder containing it, public health least fuck you. that's great sounds like city. rural communities. lots places access high speed internet even dsl. would take days driving around deliver food them. remarkable, doubts. also reason trust RIVM. ""It not"" referring RIVM opinion though, mine per se. even offers temporary protection

Fuck me, would nightmare US. Temporary protection would godsend could get everybody vaccinated time. sizable populations unwilling comply, risk harbor disease duration vaccine's protection, sparking new outbreaks wears off. It’s great place live, long aren’t looking make money. It’s somewhat hardscrabble existence here, end paying lot extra money heating driving, groceries expensive elsewhere everything else too. It’s worth me, aspirations get rich. #BernieSandersWouldHaveWon really answer questions.

I kinda goal?? well least possible one

And preventing ton people getting sick not? Thank goodness. Sources? Democrats blocked Trump operations benefits last stimulus package. 

Trump insisting payroll tax benefit, would directly reduce Trump's operations tax bill. 

Plus cut payroll tax would weaken social security, making case cuts social security.

At point, trying mislead people. Free speech actually mean freedom say whatever want without consequence. actual phrasing refers government restricting speech. Private platforms right duty ban harmful speech. never constitution. Read OP posted, specific Supreme Court decision explicitly spells cases people penalized free speech. put simply Chief Justice Holmes ruled someone cried fire theatre movie theater people hurt killed result person would held liable right express speech could get people killed without consequence. 

These people encourage people things objectively could make people sick kill right broadcast speech major platform like YouTube. 

There profound difference place like China free speech non-government owned platforms like YouTube choosing ban accounts inflammatory rhetoric. 

No one right wrong endangers people. can’t see deeply misguided. sure, well people following social distancing masking now? I’m far area thinks it’s needed don’t know anyone personally affected first round. takes hold now, future, people screwed allowed believe safe. Yeah, totally. agree you. going get gnarly. ending federal unemployment benefit going make things gnarlier, faster. businesses go under. jobs lost. folks needing unemployment. people made homeless pandemic. hungry kids. people getting sick can't afford doctor. civil unrest. State unemployment enough avoid things.

This personal sacrifice, like people tighten belts buy new tv something. people able afford essential things are. Tennessee still mask mandate. work “hotspot” county STILL put mandate place.

What different US? businesses cannot manage provide benefits protections global counterparts? Wow, per study 11.8% household contacts infected. says similar results found US studies. absolutely changes view contagious virus is. assumed somebody family caught it, everyone family would soon. per study, it’s unlikely spread within family.

Someone explain even possible? stupid people believe it’s “old” people, certain health conditions weak immune systems etc. get impacted negatively virus “young people” can’t get (which straight BS).

That sort shaky foundation beginning cases started flooding babies, kids, teenagers young adults don’t meet specific criteria started getting infected dying this. still can’t believe dumbass kid months ago America licked toilet bowl dare got fucking COVID-19 it. Two reasons come mind.

1. Maybe people feel disgust recording viewing kind videos. could people subconsciously feel someone struggling COVID-19 ""holy moment"" left hidden.
2. Maybe videos links referring quickly censored excuses ""FUD"" ""COVID-19 misinformation"".

""Disturbing new revelations permanent immunity coronavirus may possible jeopardized vaccine development reinforced decision scientists UCSF affiliated laboratories focus exclusively treatments.

Several recent studies conducted around world indicate human body retain antibodies build infections, meaning may lasting immunity COVID-19 people recover.

Strong antibodies also crucial development vaccines. molecular biologists fear way left control disease may treat symptoms people infected prevent debilitating effects, including inflammation, blood clots death.

“I don’t see vaccine coming anytime soon,” said Nevan Krogan, molecular biologist director UCSF’s Quantitative Biosciences Institute, works partnership 100 research laboratories. “People antibodies, antibodies waning quickly.” antibodies diminish, “then good chance immunity vaccine would wane too.”

The latest bad news came scientists King’s College London, whose study 90 COVID-19 patients United Kingdom found antibody levels peaked three weeks onset symptoms dramatically declined.

Potent antibodies found 60% patients, according study, 17% retained potency three months later. cases, antibodies disappeared completely, said study published preprint Saturday, meaning yet peer-reviewed.

The report latest growing chain evidence immunity COVID-19 short-lived.

A Chinese study published June 18 journal Nature Medicine also showed coronavirus antibodies taking nosedive. study 74 patients, conducted Chongqing Medical University, branch Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention, showed 90% exhibited sharp declines number antibodies within two three months infection.

....

So far, though, scattered reports reinfection comprehensive studies verified happen. Experts say disease hasn’t around long enough determine likelihood contracting disease once. kinds coronaviruses, like cause common cold, offer clues.

Studies four seasonal coronaviruses cause colds show although people develop antibodies, immune response declines time people become susceptible again. Scientists suspect severity cold symptoms reduced previous infections.

“Waning antibodies affect vaccine development,” said Shannon Bennett, chief science San Francisco’s California Academy Sciences. “Where natural immunity doesn’t really develop last, vaccine programs likely easily successful achievable.”

...

“Our understanding protective immunity engendered virus interacts past immunity coronaviruses still evolving,”Bennett said. “People presume immunity.”

...

Epidemiologists found neutralizing antibodies less 5% COVID-19 patients hoping isolate use inoculate others, precursor full vaccine. Unfortunately, recent studies show super-strength antibodies also fade away.

The Chinese study found 11.7% decline neutralizing antibodies symptomatic coronavirus patients 8.3% drop asymptomatic individuals three months.

...

Even vaccine produced, infectious disease specialists say could take years entire population inoculated. vaccine wore time, periodic boosters would needed, influenza shots.

All emphasizes need effective treatments.

...

The trick, Krogan said, find several drugs work virus create kind cocktail, like combination treatments HIV-AIDS patients use control infection. Researchers currently testing drugs hamsters mice, soon trials monkeys, Krogan said. said hopes develop cocktail end year.

It difficult, admitted, people infected COVID-19 display [so many different lingering long virus gone.

People reported vision problems, confusion memory issues. Cases chronic fatigue, heart problems, lung damage, blood clotting neurological symptoms like dizziness confusion documented numerous patients long initial symptoms COVID-19 gone away.

Epidemiologists believe most[ severe cases result overactive human immune system response. That’s think causes inflammatory reaction similar Kawasaki disease recently affecting children exposed coronavirus, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

...

“I’ve never seen virus get fingers many biological processes once,” Krogan said. “It’s fascinating, horrifying, complicated virus.”

...

Whatever happens, epidemiologists hope recent reports antibody viability put rest concept embraced many young people herd immunity, disease can’t find victims many people survived infections must immune.

Make airtight except perhaps allowing air air filter, ie; HEPA, better yet 'ULPA' air filter. Could perhaps get tubing, attach directly onto suit air go it, put filter end tubing. maybe tubing, attach filter material directly onto suit itself. Bam, something 100% effective simple mask shield - mask maybe protect everything, face shield sort shield virus still float AROUND it. full body suit hand, covers entire body, much safer.

Maybe look strange - time like this, kinda necessary. want get information there, much better covering small part body. Actually better chances airborne virus, mask, small coverings safe enough. really hurt Republican nonsense. hope people remember November.   interest improving understanding, answer way I'm would get far mark?  

To something work with, end (in NM) still Saturday - 9:45 pm.  Bloomberg, death toll 140,000, whereas logged number 6:30pm, 139,426 (wow... jumped lot 4 hours!).  

So week underrepresenting happened today.  BUT, next week flip, since extra deaths go somewhere... go next week's data.  deaths tipping edge one week next, sometimes deaths would go next week tipping current one (based logging numbers later earlier day, basically).  Overall, can't make numbers disappear; go somewhere.  deaths generally going up, eventually show (give take week, basically).  Right?

I'm asking good faith - genuinely would like get better idea this.  way see it, ""messiness"" around edges, - slightly lopsided weeks.  ""my"" weeks can't consistently under-report deaths.  There's way repeatedly, since chop week shorter logging numbers earlier earlier day get 12:00 am.  Right?  (And that's assuming would want chop week get lower numbers... aim all).

I agree way good yours.  started personal journal kind thing.  many dead today?  awhile, month two, started thinking... man, looking numbers day day super informative.  started looking every 10 days, eventually said... let's week.  got am.  sloppy method random boob (me) would come with.  based personal desire keep track numbers every day.  Clearly better wait next day get total whole previous day.  still get way far mark.

I probably rolling average. Politics aside, think children smarter adults sheer number neural connections culled. would say peak intellect around 12-17 years age, although unfortunately coincidences teenager. Good point First thing: need isolate immediately. risk passing whatever virus someone else.

Second, get test.

Third, try panic. get lots fluids rest. Many people don’t get life threatening version disease, try worry much long symptoms stay manageable. That’s cute, think world know still exist grandchildren. YouTube video recommended talking Bill Gates wants kill black people. Like what. dude giving mosquito nets vaccines. He’s trying keep alive. Even Africa nutty people believe nonsense. Sign here: deliberately trying harm country. point destroy Fed, break unions, privatize whatever sold off, cash whatever salvaged. 31 notably lower median. would 25. Sorry no. relates area listen public health officials 

Your area can’t speak too. areas seem full idiots

We learned schools open close call That's attracts place. Honestly, still majority people country feels similarly. problem selfish loud. read crazy stuff phone lockdown. say president tried tell people do, didnt listen. hobbies. say people go crazy lockdown. everything lifted, can't handle go deep end. u/undeleteparent giant covid bacteria,

I would hope could provided better role model self destructive NY. killed many, citizens spread en masse FL rest country, waited long lockdown , claiming control (lol)

 HK Taiwan even Korea despite crazy religious spreaders). places high density, good job keeping control everytime starts flair up. negative. Unfortunately tests 100% accurate problem. ( especially USA ) apparently dense population. anything proven trump and/or supporter?! I'm gonna continue wearing mask planes getting eyebrows done homegirl straight breaths mouth lol. otherwise, let's go back normalllll IMO math one subjects translate well video. much easier student watching understand work involved watch someone else directly play back confirm moron. Anyone ""smart"" enough professor stupid put mask drain society. We're better without them. goodluck making money FB.  average CPM something like 20 cents per 1k views..... time peak flu shot season. 

Great. can't even believe attempted lockdown Colombia, let alone reinstating Bogota. much suffering imposed poor Colombia even stop spread corona virus. Shame responsible congress likely never face repercussions. surprisingly low considering much care happened states. Hopefully delayed giant death toll. exactly making safe bet. fucking shit, written 6 year old. best bet would hit nursing homes first seniors large. High spread high risk homes. work university it’s starting ramp next two weeks. Mostly
In person classes... There’s lot data represents good news coming rarely gets talked about. Canada high percentage people wearing masks unlike US. Keep mind virus mutate time. bet anti-vaxx movement going get whole lot new members come Worth asking level debt now, ballpark... want answer suddenly change 3 million tomorrow hahaha hehe can't sorry speaking ur truths.

I’d prefer pandemic fucks sake don’t trust government looking best interest anymore. Uses AAV delivery... potentially significant population may pre-existing immunity could impact efficacy vaccine generating enough titer fact reddit promotes sub source facts genuine information atrocious. size sample pool close possible expected ratio tests return positive? 

for example expect 1 10 tests positive, pool size 100 tests likely pool return positive, would use pool size 10 less, test pool would reflect expected positive tests within pool. using example: 10 test pool 1 10 pools would positive, 5 test pool would 1 10 pools would positive, 20 test pool would 1 5 test pools positive.

but guess sampling larger pools likelyhood pool return positive results would increase, would test larger number tests pool. guess 4 sample pool would imply LEAST (i cant believe state this) 75% pools would negative. Mississippi 3 million people.

Expectations need tempered. Greatly. much sub likes harp Disney, honestly, think something worth considering: aren’t “essential” business taking nearly precautions? Disney theme parks know short leash, stores public places know little risk actually shut down. think businesses actually enforced mask mandates, temp checks (which yes likely catch cases, help detect some), provide face shields employees, etc., think would better position. think Disney could improve things, overall, sounds like much better job many “essential” businesses. 

I also feel conflicted open, one hand, would best everyone stay home. hand, Trump Republicans made impossible businesses shut employees stay home. think problem though people’s financial situations gotten dire though government forced companies employees go back work.

Hostile? No. Dismissive bit blunt? Definitely. apologize came across hostile though. 

My entire point none us thread enough information supersede doubts actual scientists closest data.

I definitely biased bit frustrated dismissal genuine good news redditors, even coming straight horses mouth trust most. Totally guilty.

You absolutely, probably smart, well educated person. I'm saying whether points good not. I'm saying neither enough information know points good not. Fauci says it’s least 1 1.5 years away. believe? Yeah, lose kind ADA claim moment refuse curbside service. 2024, pandemic years short-term interesting research published decimated death. Yes realise - Australian sense trust Americans. No, proved wrong... admitted it. Yea, idk lol. Thanks recognition yes factory. article contain actual data. link ADHS dashboard.

So ICU beds use flat. days, days. patients flattened since 12th.

That interesting data. seen explained given increasing number cases. Science advanced tremendously recent years. virus sequenced within month. huge jump start developing vaccine vs traditional methods vaccine discovery used past. Ok many people actually this? first I’ve heard check virus anyone network friends/family. really necessary wouldn’t shouting rooftops? another reddit bubble “must have”. friends/family would never know buy stands right now. Sure, catch spread it. already know that. Let’s maybe put confined places sleeping 7-8 hours every night. Good thing that’s something happens schools!

As teacher deaths.... severely risk death covid, take personal responsibility choose different job path while. share living space family member high risk, same. doctors, nurses, grocery store clerks, etc it.... teachers. way flu vaccine gets distributed. distribution networks place. Well strong possibility least months that. doubt Trump continue try prop stock market November regardless long term consequences. US world's biggest economy many nations dependent US dollar value, LOT leeway break fundamentals (seemingly) without consequences end like Zimbabwe.

The problem can't really put coming hits mass evictions followed mass mortgage defaults. something help people next weeks allow procedures move forward, trigger domino effect dire financial problems. Homeowners hit little delayed immediate shot renters, without help really start kicking Thanksgiving there's way shitshow spring. something. bizarre...he's sheltered majority US population.

Doesnt interact much, doesnt see whats happening around him, common mindset really is.

Its year US Army reported majority citizens ""unfit"" service due either poor health education issues. Unforgivable Interestingly, risk groups also ones vaccine either help, might endanger. kinda like opposite.

Edit; major vectors health care workers priority, agreed Inflation already occurred. See stock market real estate prices.

The Fed absolutely hellbent making sure asset bubbles never collapse, hence ridiculous amount money printing since pandemic. mean... trump already gave $1.2 billion Oxford development vaccine. Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana... confederate states really... Look source, Lancet.

That's important one. forgot CNN MSNBC list. Media lies, period. used guard dog government lapdog. mean, bandana material loops attached would meet requirements. It’s like loops really affect material mask made of. 538 article weeks ago: reference meme image made rounds social media link Snopes article refutes it: takeaway efficacy masks, especially home made cloth coverings, ability affect coronavirus transmission likelihood still early stages determination. meme image misleading gives false sense security CDC's recommendations avoid transmission (social distancing, limiting group sizes, staying outdoors) much important. Except guys can’t go anywhere outside country, right? situation sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry. ranted them? think Oxford university worried Captain Creamsicle's chances getting reelected? want provide worlds population escape horrors 600,000+ dead. dont give rats ass politics others thrust this. gets downvoted? Yikes. rural MD, feel doctors calling 13 different hospitals, begging bed. nurses working 1:11 sick patients? dangerous. means we're risk getting sick beds care.

Please stay home. Wear masks wash must venture out.

And yes, vote everyone set US health care system fire. edited. It’s 300million US. Ya don’t fucking say saw people wearing masks LA protests without. said, I'm saying actions help contribute current problem. protests month, figures actions accounted for. protests I'm seeing anti-mask, anti-lockdown protests. we've also still got small group idiots self-entitled wear mask. 

Meanwhile south LA, we've got entirely different breed stupidity. Brilliant. Thanks! CDC guidelines coronavirus yet, likely include politicians. priority flu pandemic. There’s certainly MANY factors consider, think commented elsewhere thread social impacts development. really significant, I’m really happy way will/can/has affected people. I’m excited see innovations come improve engagement.

Here me. real damage consider younger generation, addressed much possible. end scale literally KNOW increasing infections end many lives. I’m master ethics statistics. I’m faced problem try think ethically.. options guaranteed save lives win every time me. ""So they will stay home regardless wait national folly play out"".

Pretty much this. basically comes going hold longest. That's going come pandemic still healthy. 

You correct logical thing. 

And ever might thinking safe let guard down, think twice, again. stubbornly socially distance longest prevail.  Dig claws ease up. Oxford's results get like 170 upvotes tomorrow whereas extreme statistical outlier Worst Possible Thing case upvoted top.

Reddit full shut-ins. introverts, that's something else entirely, shut-ins want continue long possible. Like everything Victoria took way long this. let genie bottle want go back in! Hopefully Victorians sneak NSW! much it? 14.9 million doses, represents proportion US population world population? Hopefully issuing vaccines bring US back track. China able build 3 hospitals 6 days, least able build N95 factory 4 months... c'mon said first time, blame state city officials behest federal government, there's $$$ funneled states right now. logic, keep everything closed Trump sends aid 2021 time vaccine. lose-lose situation. Literally caught economic medical devastation. blaming individuals following CDC guidelines first place. 300 million. two different strains COVID-19, weaker strain traveling West Coast China, much stronger strain (a mutation) traveling Europe East Coast eventually West Coast. possible infected strain. Sounds like weaker one first stronger one. 

Also, wearing mask, hand washing, social distancing guarantee 100% protection, reducing odds infection. 31 50 definitely trending towards “much less dense most...” think rural carries certain connotation doesn’t apply Vermont far considered populous dense. Followed fireworks.  smell farts Fuck. 

I literally spoke woman company deals often complaining gym enforcing masks canceled membership brushed wear mask everywhere 11m old. 

Meanwhile Georgia kemp suing masks interfere business? Where? 

Im tired idiots putting son risk. son important idiocy.  rest world months. governor mandated pizza rafts couple weeks ago. way HELL catch carrying around one things. Yea, one could argue much harsher ""mask public"" mandate. even anything close Canada worried next US.

I'd really like smash people nerf bat see *groups* walking wrong way isles grocery stores dumb shit like that. younger people too. stupid age. love dumbasses attitude. ""i cant believe government shut businesses,"" well look, government isnt one shutting everything down, virus is. That's unnecessary illegal. worth legal trouble even evil there's many volunteers. Man that’s scary decline ICU availability No. heard experts discussing clinicians reporting seeing firsthand. It’s guy saying it. One reference TWIV podcasts Daniel Griffin on. discussed last week.

WTF parents *Assumptions* deadly really much refrigeration either really door seals gas tight. Imagine thinking politicians directly involved production vaccines testing, clearly don’t understand shit works shut fuck evidence coming light support infected once. Makes sense since coronavirus all. generally risk people first, like cancer survivals, copd, asthma, 65 plus, etc ""Alternative Deaths .. They're really sleepy."" Source? high school going person US infected world downside? Time gym increased heart rate respiration cause pre-symptomatic people expel virus, inhale virus deeper lungs - meaning they're probably likely develop severe disease need hospital.  breaking news

Fucking ridiculous. difference knowing caring. know, care. even remarkable considering England death covid-19 antibodies detected recorded covid-19 related death (it's one reason UK daily deaths still much higher rest Europe, even though hardly serious/critical cases hospital ventilators (about 150 now, even Germany +200)) friend judges competed professionally deadlifts 4x body weight.

He slightly lesser extent, leadership states follow lead, reason still plowing way first wave even peaked, world cleaning outbreak.

How many deaths foolishness going cause? I'm shocked guy fake hair, fake tan, fake finances, fake physical fitness would lie something sake appearances. ever could predicted shocking development? changed position anything, still mask order, still even expressing regret personally going maskless indoor public space.

His case mild (so far). Unfortunately idiots often cut shit unless cases get bad. probably going end another statement people use discredit medical reaction COVID, along original renouncement masks. Pretty sure enemy covid19........ really though? lack evidence support either benefit detriment seems rather premature automatically jump THC ridiculous notion. Cannabis plenty known medical uses, including antiinflammatory properties.

A quick Google search show least Cannabinoids could possibly part treatment regimen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) medications target immune pathways, could downregulate cytokine storm

Also, people seem forget plenty non harmful ways ingest cannabinoids. Oral topical come mind. People think weed ""yeah dude let's get stoned!"", plenty uses.

So no, detect sarcasm. Surprised Pikachu face. seem like Trump held accountable anything. like could shoot someone middle 5th Ave people would still support him. :( RemindMe! 2 weeks downward trend reversed soon Wuhan done counting.

The numbers single digits Wuhan done counting. ""reversed"" new cluster Beijing. many times need 14th-31st 333 asymptomatic cases. 17 days 33 cases across rest country?  14 June 1st. 353 asymptomatic cases May 27th data missing.

The outbreak China. expect find asymptomatic cases places China. Asymptomatic cases include imported cases. early June, imported asymptomatic cases lion share nations test asymptomatic people? No. obvious do. 

A distinction without difference. effectively test asymptomatic people. would wager miss majority asymptomatic cases research respectable institutions insinuate absolutely still stuck March. worry, things get better early hit countries. watch toilet paper hand sanitizer. 

193 countries around world. countries contact tracing. countries claim contact tracing effective contact tracing. select effective contact tracing 10. good one. Stay safe. 

Try move goal posts much next time. China fact counting asymptomatic cases. arrested protesters asking arrest cops killed Breona Taylor Houston outside public officials house, arrest assholes immediately. Fuckwits. Oh irony. 

At least though wearing masks interact public they’ll infecting other.

But one cries gestapo get sick. real problem amount per cap dead NYC vs literally anywhere else. I’m tolerant him, it’s like march White House demand removed. I’ve contacted representatives many times much gotten done save two them. Mitch locked one certain side couple people dissenting (such Mitt).  point, I’m hoping governor state keep things sane. 

I can’t believe he’s still sitting, too. Also, please pandemic. want good 2025. worry guys, trump wants cut funding tests worry higher numbers. Wow. states never second guesses anything. grow humans, evaluate past experiences. Yet guy, state's powerful leader basically says fuck it, oh well. Great, privileged a-holes visiting neighborhood drinks sidewalk droplet spewing confidence selfish reckless behavior. Still lot anti-maskers northern AZ, think lot folks incredibly selfish know it. long health care friends exhausted long shifts, I'm gonna mask trust first hand info. killing old people agree Smh. seriously sound like trying muddy waters works doesn't

How managed that? Show I've said masks help. average mask helps prevent droplet transmission people wearing masks

No, prevents spread, caught. Standard masks protect it. Medical ones do.

You've taken comment, misunderstood point, gone rant without reading branches, say care. Alrighty bud. Hope get surprise children  media, health experts politicians completely dropped virus solid month cheered mass protests.  really know sub continues act confused people stopped caring.

I intended talk us elections future. 

The 2016 election tipping point America. standing precipice, ready jump either direction. anti, least outside establishment election. Bernie, man spent lifetime government yet still remained outside, clinched nomination thoroughly documented stolen him, would likely won. 

Looking 2020 nomination process, could argued looking multiple elections cookie cutter, interchangeable candidates ultimately change nothing name guy power. guess see. Maybe old guard dead 2024 get fresh blood. get anti-establishment candidate. got ego bruised baby axe grind Obama. FED warning extending deadline disastrous. Besides, literally reason we've paid thousands thousands taxes (most us, anyway)- shit hits fan used help support us keep things going.
 Beyond that, fiat currency requires good faith money- constantly pumping via commerce retain value dollar people's minds. UI benefits run people stop spending entirely, still jobs, thats we're serious trouble. People stopped caring media health experts cheered mass protests. Could be, even get frequency flu, say (and seems high side) 50 times life. case .5 percent chance dying would add 25 percent chance disease time death, 25 percent chance stealing 4 years life. would steal 1 year collective lifespans.

Even drinking hell lot damage us choose willingly. gonna long hard lesson eventually sink enough people indoor functions can't realistically happen pandemic. least UK, US, Russia Brazil. said nothing death. get from? Well, Americans (assumed) use ""Olympic size"" toilets filled inches top! worry huge waves toilet water washing sides every time ""squeeze round"" Australia (Down Under).

Even farting would probably enough cause Tsunami toilets! agree 100%. guys working butts know. unprecedented time. 

 also imagine challenge kids day day without venue change could difficult. can't speak anyone appreciate change venue time time. used nanny summertime even kids day day home required creativity. missed adult connection! ( expected fulfill another job online watched them.)


 Whatever happens know guys rock stars. frustrating believe kids get something positive end even learning navigate crisis survive. can't always see moment develop character. 

 always naysayers. However know work putting in. Continue advocate kids. find solution. upcoming fall another learning experience. schools go back session person schools won't. use data see works best keep adjusting. 

Hang there!  people around since early 1900s sure much earlier. wish could find article Spanish Flu deniers. primary school started giving prizes 100% attendance. parents word head idea binned. 

There always families terrible attendance reasons nothing illness problem. used send child back home came pre school sick. Would ring parent come get them. title thread makes sound like masks way prevent infection. could also gotten hands, rubbing eyes, droplets someone reached eyes. he's actually praising negligent murder nursing home patients? thinks Fauci extremely biased? state from? Remember Murphy NJ Lamont CT Cuomo NY 14 day quarantine hotspot states.  kinds people incapable empathy see something problem personally effects them. MI, great, soon Governor said okay start opening back up, everyone assumed meant social distancing wearing masks over.

Luckily things haven’t quite gotten control we’re back mandatory masks. Ottawa high... went Walmart Shoppers last week everyone wearing mask. things friends here. navy ship want take patients covid. time tests way test people say covid. Eventually relented. think explanation hits nail head Yea sure, guess forcing nursing homes take back covid infected people killing thousands result model copy nationwide huh? Fu×÷#&amp;% disgusting. Fauci, de Blasio Cuomo face death penalty murder. sensationalized anything. Howard County Prince George’s County Maryland distance learning January 29. Oh, that's Harris colleagues found antibody levels fell certain point children previously infected, greater risk severe dengue disease infected. fact, children whose antibodies fell within low range — sort anti-sweet spot — risk nearly eight times higher contrast, higher antibody levels protective severe illness.  think US less compliance shutdowns countries, though. also state state instead federal level, definitely left pockets fester. neck woods anti-maskers majority start. surprise vaccines gets someone sick entire day 50% people taking it. often considered worth people think actually things body much worse. anti vaxers ball couple people die it. get pulled. wants bet refuse stimulis BILLS (not checks) aid thise lost jobs massive boost hazard pay front lines working essential jobs. feels like gross dereliction duty. possibly claim best interest anyone? duty protect citizenry threats national scope, think global pandemic qualifies.

Maybe paid someone take SAT too. 30000 dead correct countries fewer dead New York. people scared shitless actually wear masks doesn’t mean weren’t failed abandoned government meant keep safe Fauci puppet months now. political, terrible job hiding it. village idiot revered presence. K would think someone whose grown wealthy usually pay problems go away able lead effectively situation ... money answer.... report showed severe cases COVID-19 rare among Swedish Finnish children aged 1 19, deaths reported.

That different thing. OP's article talks **children spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus**. talking **the virus causing COVID-19 children**.

One silently spread virus still asymptomatic. think poatage paid already, drop mail slot.

In Cali anyway, 100% sure everywhere else. years whole ordeal past 6 months youve already seen bubble burst states they're cutting corners, mean they're cutting red tape not, safely corners. hope Buffalo gets World Series This. I'm older millenial side, think lot people understand spiritually broken lot Gen-Y Z state world, feeds current state nihilistic seflishness seems common.

Sure, individual better person make difference. absolutely crucial fixing state things, can't say results surprising many broken, exhausted, desperate thanks world often seems like uphill battle survive in. end result painful amounts infighting broken lives, shattered friendships communities grew together. truly depressing.

On hopeful note, unity current administration near universal least. What? Masks work? test positive?  Don’t feel targeted, adverb implies he‘s sexually active guy. Sometimes think hes hero standing trump, says something idiotic like this. Yea there’s significant numbers added 2 weeks. Yikes. Thanks link. know there’s website updates kind plot? find far useful function paperwork submission. understand heard thing 2016. became running joke. Fine, lot people didn’t like Hillary campaign truly awful. truth Biden 1000x better able lead us right Trump. shouldn’t even suggestion think otherwise. appreciate lady's message honesty, seems well intentioned. apparantly, getting cream-pied sitting ass nine months makes epidemiological expert America. we're at. may true China reported first death then. distinctly remember seeing video ER docs Wuhan flipping new virus causing hospitals overrun, visiting laws, late December/early January. know doctors Wuhan tried raise alarm weeks China finally admitted possibly maybe tiny little issue. BSN obviously makes RN, field, education money. get points making end day $19 hour RN underpaid. someone wants work 19$ RN great need help, person get money easily. work cat scan tech I’m working less 25$.  racist, and, call racist person chickenshit hiding behind throwaway. Reddit doesnt support narrative. Same. sixth grade always said sick kids school calling slut. plenty testing going even area. It’s matter individual going way actually getting tested. case 2 test thus far I’ve manage take half hour less wouldn’t possible. I’m sure people would travel good distance get tested like grandparents shouldn’t even road ages. probably put risk even leave get tested first place choice due visits grandchildren. don’t people stand act rights time? Trump rest government wouldn’t around people wished Somewhat interesting [valve airflow also directed sideways compared directly forward. Speculating least exhale energy dispersed among mask filter material, clue percentage ratio is. Sure.... one fault federal government. silly blame local leaders city officials reopening. Lose-lose situation there's vaccine flight attendants get it? really can’t wait get back plane! can't reopen schools fax :)

/s absolutely hate needles anything sort, inject shit biggest needle need be, asap! People say Disney won’t empty due global depression/recession next year anyway Airbnb tent? I’ll believe see it.. great, shame capitalism means us see another year minimum Except immunity lasts month two, that. 2022, realistically. gods work. keeping us safe, deserve much much trophy That's strictly true, go try edit incorrectly see happens live gulf coast Mississippi, say fucked, FUCKED. 90% Mississippians think smarter experts, think whole world helping fake pandemic get DT office. hope Mississippi get everything deserve. wait? 

Also would leave never come back they're 18? castle man. Take China request moderator sub verify reliable media outlet India. thrive sensationalism instead actually news reporting. *As long doesn’t get Trump re-elected u know 30% false positives something blah blah propoganda? (Perhaps misreading it. )

They picking people disabled study, picking people random infected. 

We need studies latter type though. least 20% NYC caught it, 70-100% certain towns Lombardy. percentage population places problems? seeing horror stories either place. one banana Michael, could cost? million dollars? Retail workers workers deal public first line get vaccine. CEO's Executive level employees work home work Zoom calls last people society get vaccine.

I'm dreaming way rollout works.  think restrictions enough stop infections spiking again? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wrongly comparing N95 respirators surgical masks homemade facial coverings. Apples oranges.

Initially, homemade masks recommended protect wearer. began recommend homemade masks determined could protect others wearing them. fact virus spread normal conversation breathing, coughing sneezing, led change guidance.

When mishandled, medical-grade respirators make things worse: professionals need can't get mishandled masks spread infection know use properly. 

Homemade masks comparable. blunt, infected mishandle homemade mask, really care. long protects us you, help.

In case, see sub become overconfident masks, taking unnecessary risks. masks entirely free disadvantages. substitute social distancing.   great news! hope different strains don’t start evolve like Flu. unknowns COVID scary Sitting warehouse perhaps. I’m interested seeing gets distributed ISN’T HIGHER UP??? 

oh ya, media *hates good news* made burst tears. 13 year old cousin light life .. logically known anyone age *could"" die this, articles like like punch gut. hope least one person reads takes seriously money make way ultra rich hoard offshore account taking circulation.  Can’t believe amount dumbasses believe unironically. I’ve seen people discredit try undermine every bit good news say “no, stay doors, expect last well 2021 maybe even 2022, anyone thinks ends sooner lying themselves!” alarming say least. 4/10 funny scale ain’t bad! Better would given myself. divorce, long-time gf broke weeks ago. relationship strongest pandemic quarantine definitely put final nail coffin. *There’s six feet you’re crammed around table sharing food.*

So, that? Oxford running Phase II/III time though end July trials UK, Brazil South Africa fully running - Moderna starting Phase III next week so.

To quote head UK Vaccine Taskforce one quick statistic. Oxford study have
likely vaccinated efficacy subjects other
vaccines actually start big efficacy trials. gives scale of
how far ahead versus companies.


But obviously means nothing work. one elicits cells addition antibodies, best chance lasting longer. question exactly...are going enforce best practices viral containment? else combat spread? it’s worth, everyone’s “baseline” Anything lower serious checked out. Ok grumpy. So... three people died workplace, within short period time, guy shrugs random coincidence? 

This pandemic really brought idiots surface. see study enhancement, enhancement found. that’s good! People 1 brain cell never argued working. Please let 21st night.. Death school today’s age technology easily get tech zoom lectures. talking bare minimum technology. slow internet option record lectures downloaded viewed fully downloaded. accessible even smart phones work well viewing. 

I’m saying would challenges, alternative even 5% deaths it’s insane even consider taking months.

Edit: add, know many social problems consider well. brother elementary school teacher we’ve discussed much younger kids depend social interactions development. certainly drawbacks staying closed schools months. I’m suggesting aren’t downsides. compared lives saved reducing infections, think still err side schools/sports/large group shutdowns. moderna vaccine successful don’t bet anyone outside US seeing least year.  like last thing. Don’t forget Biomed Techs keep medical equipment running! Exactly. always lies everything. Well, then, might 120 million people infected, going us. Great example provincial Liberal party British Columbia actually liberal, conservative (well, conservative Canada gets...). Paywall Me? can't understand I'm saying, asking wrong person. pretty straight forward analogy understand. Lots kids close quarters. pretty solid refutation concept kids can't catch / spread it. Nah don’t give inch shouldn’t open period. florida..what expect? valve entire discussion about, going say irrelevant?

What point trolling me? asshole? Maybe tell people, wear mask flu symptoms....that make head explode supplied 1 N-95 mask per week, returned getting new one along paper masks 1 per shift. 

Now issued either. staff ER still getting weekly supplies COVID floor staff too. Anyone else supplies mask choice continue reuse last issued set. 

Our worry “How many people come contact one shift high risk undiagnosed/asymptomatic”. 

Our numbers might low statement put hospital works “We need treat everyone virus, currently people staying away hospital COVID fear bringing it. Soon people avoid hospital cause getting it”. 

I understand many things unable control recently started allowing visitors hospital puts many unnecessary risk it’s crazy. ""Not safe say. Big if. Fake Fauci even doubts it.""  main goal get USA. vaccine allow civilized country ""like Vietnam"" I'll take. Hey.. atleast dont blind followers like Hitler jr here. also expensive - guaranteed. Somewhere else also bad shape doesn’t negate bad Florida.

And mean, Idaho total covid death toll 120 people. saying it’s nothing, Florida already seen 4,981 covid deaths.. Ok.

From Oxford Vaccine Group: team Oxford led Prof. Sarah Gilbert, Prof. Andrew Pollard, Prof. Teresa Lambe, Dr Sandy Douglas Prof. Adrian Hill **started work designing vaccine Saturday 10th January 2020.** current status identified vaccine candidate working towards first clinical testing phase. 

(Emphasis think Trump concluded best way forward February?  think advice given come conclusion best country? think came worst, dumbest conclusion possible? Trump concluded race towards herd immunity would best bet. Costa Rica population 5 million proof don’t need education accomplish everything. Holy crap read  Same. It’s nuts TN right now. kid gifted scores highest school STAAR tests. probably get funding bring testing average lose 10 days misses per year. I’m confident ever vaccine. don’t one common cold also coronavirus. don’t one HIV. many others. Nah, help Trump say everything back normal. Personally, I'm lot worried getting severe non-lethal case. Living fallouts years decades sound fun.  Mayor Eric Garcetti conceded Sunday Los Angeles reopened quickly warned city ~~was~~ “on brink” new shutdown orders coronavirus continues surge California. *does quick back-of-the-napkin math... 14 15 conception*

Technically correct! one predicted 8/10 presidential elections within month, I'm sure. nothing's given way know us elections. vaccine named Chad[...] ofc going work!!! It’s absolutely fucked. partner’s coworker tested positive, girlfriend symptomatic. partner worked closely him, went get tested (neither companies required us to?!). tested last Sunday. Yesterday morning, lab called said tests lost? got tested peace mind, we’re double digits since exposure. We’ve also required go office entire time. Maybe take sales course, persuasion skills, ability convince people anything LACKING.  Would useless considering amount antvaxxers? potential known checked for. vaccine, treatment anything found problem SARS-CoV-2 yet. Yes, vigilant, chance finding ADE slim, yet everyone drabbled writeups ""knows stuff"" makes 100% assured happening. 

I would suggest listen todays Update Peter Griffin, brings new context. could looking bi-phasic illness small minority patients, exhibit exact progression. 

It never bad idea vigilant things, infinitely worse idea someone go toot horn spreads falsehoods, insecurities, fabrications potential lies made quick clicks. similar experience. teach high school math certified sped teacher. lot students learning disabilities excelling remote learning able concentrate. lot social anxiety exists classroom alleviated. say students typically perform average hindered quarantine. impacted everyone differently. I'd rather students staff survive another year though. imagine wealthy celebrities get first like got first set tests sparse. remember people sick AF news couldn’t get tested then, think was, chRles Barkley comes like ooo cough doctor got test 😂 think theyre using two together? can't find original source saw may anecdotal. right though, seriously lower percentage. really think Florida's health care much better New York's. Whatever reason, hope stays low. Riot and/or start union. get involved union already one. one get hopes it’s 2020 September new virus come  read article?

It seems young kids transmit less older kids weekly numbers, week lost less last week: 4,826 versus 4,999 week before.  

It's still horrifying level death, I'm seeing major uptick.  Cases, hand, vastly increasing.  +435,218 cases last week, versus 403,128 week before, versus +325,337 week that.  Cases drastically going up, deaths not, whatever reason.  Atlantic good article deaths indeed going spike... convincing read.  far I'm seeing anything major.

(minor edit fix typo one numbers). I’ve staffing industry 25 years. could tell stories....  it’s justified lies public masks don’t work? ever supposed trust him? Okay misread comment. age based makes sense, hear bit. Everything Q waiting holy grail never manifests. mean, AZ sending people states enough room hospitals them. in-state hospitalizations flattening necessarily mean things improving, means can't handle patients. “They died covid, covid” still current Facebook wisdom. bordering treason. necessary public health. endanger lives people manage make harder medical providers leaders?  one issue swedes much healthier Americans. Less diabetes, less obesity, better physical fitness, less poverty, better diets, better medical care preexisting conditions, probably also get vitamin due mostly ethnic Swedes living Sweden. low death rate might due policy response much overall health.  could admit use phone trace anyway would lot simpler. us anyway... Thats happened mild symptoms fatigued always excuse. every developed country outside US. Sufficient testing, contract tracing, real lockdowns, social distancing, masks.

We know fight this. months. question how, it. needed impeachment? THINK unity current administration universal, definitely buying it. see come election time. ‘Murica spray people around listerine?  Learn force nursing homes accept covid patients kill elders? Almost every state US less deaths per million NY. praise California, Florida Texas. Similarly large states extremely lower death counts. 

Now I’ll get downvoted stating fact. friend, want break partisanship too, partisanship literally baked constitution (and don’t believe me, read Supreme Court opinion faithless electors couple weeks ago).

It’s going take single candidate fix. That’s say it’s mountain high, instead need aim bigger terms taking apart. I'm central NY work largest hospital within 1.5 hours direction. floor saw huge spike COVID pts started, 2 3 weeks low/nearly new cases, started picking back up. We're getting 10-15 people (just floor) anymore, 1-5. Luckily seems like critical cases lately. lot people still wear masks see lot people not. Restaurants opening back people going back normal. unsettling annoying. Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. French variety, perhaps? Thanks clearing us. knows, maybe are. Maybe dawned powers NK population weak disease could devastating. B-but muh Florida... never said anti-vaccineers made smart compelling arguments GF always go back teaching *safe* so! &amp; loved ones want stay **alive &amp; well!!** current Jays lineup? Eh.  Trump basically orange Mao Zedong, stupid (anti-intellectual) dotard kills population shit policy cult personality. strange ab argument earlier someone claimed Trump fault New York wad democratic mishandling catastrophically. also used Bill O'Reilly video justification, though, im going defer Fauci's expertise one.  I'm shocked. Wyoming do-nothing governor really frustrated constituents refuse wear masks? guy steadfastly refuses step plate order masks worn. Anyone kids knows damn well especially grammar school, “perfect attendance” impossibility....unless you’re sending kid school sick. Well almost certainly true elementary/daycare age children spread less (both study studies looked different ways indicate this), still spread it. headline says, high school age children spreads almost rate adults (other studies also confirmed this). careful always specify age group mean say ""children"".  Second wave incoming autumn though... fact schools give kids awards “perfect attendance” dumb hell. I’ve seen kids got award come school sick hell. would encourage students come school matter what? 70k test backlog Arizona 10-15 days waiting cases.   armed anti-mask protest happening Columbus Ohio right now...  hate here. Even trolls better 2016. I'm frankly shocked individual #1 gotten yet, despite pretending COVID exist.  rural state highly educated people. surprise they're #1. mean, one pentagram it... bet one people wears mask gloves driving alone car. 😆 Extremely low IQ, lack empathy, inability perceive future consequences  Huge circ jerk. meet conservatives agree mask wearing. Amazing people bitching congregating beach probably ok crowd tearing statue. Yeah affects everyone differently. know several people gotten it, know anyone hospitalized yet personally. fact alone color people's impressions virus. don’t use air conditioning Vermont. Good. OC full morons. Problem people fixate first impressions. Americans listened news politicians told without research, first impression told masks ineffective could even make worse. confirm confirmation. Live OC even working hospital frequently need tell patients/visitors/contractors put nose wiener away pull mask up. I'm NJ, everywhere else rural me, well, except NYC. Oh, shit. Field hospitals national guard setups directed cuomo, wildly ineffective N.Y. state made problem nothing fed probably call authors studies mask effectiveness without reviewing studies methodology, point information like obvious thing missed.  They'll like ""ohhh could arrive conclusion? naught!"" get hero's parade figuring Um, they're both, actually. 

If believe otherwise, think doctors, surgeons dentists wear them, done many years. think blood spit flying around, dentist wearing protection prevent catching disease?

You may confused true crappy, non-medical grade masks much protect wearer. little, protect people. also true pre-Covid practice wearing one ill common Asia reason: protect others. 

But mean masks *in general* nothing wearer. Ah, makes sense then. Thanks. I'm currently watching party full mariachi band across street. hate stupid people. #ThoughtsAndPrayersAndDieting Well no, mafia fed poor starving southern Italy exchange future service. mafia much smarter. realize indebted people useful dead people. least safer lol Finally state make go...""What idiots"" Oh yeah Vermont thing... Thats one state always forget about. 1. Mirror submitted article: http://archive.is/lQc8D

2. Poetry literally zero proof wearing mask restricts oxygen flow. think mucous particles fly mask air doesnt? Look r/India, somebody posted news exact strategy used 100 years ago fight Spanish flu, slogan ""wear masks go jail"". Quietly one biggest mistakes leadership made saying masks ineffective back March. minimized importance start people still struggle come around it. First impressions matter first impressions extremely incorrect. Regardless won’t help way. realize doesn’t matter. Also cult fat fucking pond scum garbage dog shit supporters looking excuse start shooting liberals. fed doesn’t directly fund hospitals. fed indirectly funding private hospitals Medicare Medicare doesn’t give power dictate local private hospitals split wards suggested. 

And ship small part picture, national guard hospital pop wasn’t used hospital facilities closed 100% control. Sending covoid positive old people nursing homes 100% cuomo control. _Laughs Demolition Man_ Yeah I’m sarcastic Nobody knows they're losing already lost control: completed 4,952 tests per million population. Even Kyrgyzstan similar infection count, population 6 million, completed 40,000 tests per million pop date. far know things might swept rug without anyone noticing. Japan record manipulating GDP growth rate. images allowed r/coronaviurs would post shocked pikachu jpg. Yep, exactly. know countless people 30 traveling around since flights everything dirt cheap. saying right, everyone took seriously beginning would situation.

Edit: spelling  right thing do. know much individual states US, buuuut know like Vermont. much. me, probably made run 10 tests. Republican. Yup thats happened NEK still ship? like months, certainly it, none it, probably safe leave? clear present danger made think harrison ford thought ""no ticket"" scene last crusade someone edit ""no mask"" everyone furiously showing masks well....fuck it. hope outing worth people..... public pre-K programs Florida? Isn’t Bernie Sanders senator there? Man president.  sure am, need smell bad bam! One lie. Everyone country knows it. idiots like keep repeating it. Trump first world official react. needs go one way another. pals Russia going eventually, it’s matter time. told Melania Mary bad drug problem hired work Trump Org. course didn't.

The twist: Mary introduced Melania standing right there. Trump even smiled said it.

That's malignant narcissism. UK anything countries aren't.

It's bit late put lipstick pig. rushed one according Reddit experts, sure that's good enough could pay enough unemployed citizens would work... You’re either teenager someone one lose. People dark skin living Maine likely going vitamin deficient potentially susceptible virus. immigrant communities likely live close contact option social distance. Oh us vermonters want part Canada sadly going happen. 🖐 hey that's me. seen anyone call someone else do0mer 2 months.

Edit: maybe banned word... where's information speak of? pragraph full 'maybe' 'perhaps' slow clap.... Good question..... state website health department shows HIGH transmissability virus, yet, go shit still! Facts? I’m teacher I’m terrified colleagues mindset. I’m terrified respect boundaries, sneer mask, pull every chance get. safe. deaths California, Florida, Texas combined right way handle COVID? That’s New York highest number cases per million second highest deaths per million (behind New Jersey). Governor Cuomo sent sick people nursing homes exposed vulnerable group population.

Fauci lying. New York fight coronavirus correctly all.

In contrast America, big deal here. already encouraged today, decent amount people listened shopping public transport (which extensive heavily favoured driving). idiots interviewed TV listening restrictions, rare turned memes laugh at.

Sure non-N95 masks cheaper. freedom price treated like human.  100%. live anywhere near South Midwest, know Trump still hugely popular definitely win election people ""united him"" show vote. So, shocker, states highest urban populations lead nation Slow clap, ‘Merica. It'll embolden get horribly sick. Yeah.. medical expert jail country listen imbeciles ignore science?  mad person always thinks everyone else mad Smart Frankly, I'm one people who's hopes crushed twice. campaigned Sanders hard firmly believe Biden bare minimum need start course correcting. can't stop there. 


But also clearly see what's stake, think current pandemic recession going awaken larger amount people problems. 


I wish people had've paid attention months outbreak, I'll take get. I'm naive much uphill battle we're facing here. ""And one day, like magic, it'll gone."" djt offense, I’m calling liar, exactly I’m talking about. can’t use random Reddit user’s anecdote correlation Trump making yet another asinine comment slowing testing delayed results (which we’re skeptical likely coincidence) use proof. need PROOF, there’s proof can’t use it’s realm conspiracy theory.

I’m journalist, ex-auditor CFO told company $100M sales testwork use anecdote random person, I’d fired. joke, so, explain punchline? told actually he? reading written - sorry background isn’t sufficient read lines...  

“Some GOP lawmakers, angered administration’s position, pushing back trying keep $25 billion testing tracing bill, people involved negotiations told Washington Post.” Seriously. know least 2 families personally Long Island traveled Disney Florida back. don’t much hope keeping numbers rate. It’s plain selfish people downplay. mom seen hospital go COVID floors almost 7 floors COVID patients San Antonio. mentality exposes people hospital danger need face. isn’t like haven’t tried... specifically believe differently? elected officials don’t represent us many even respect constitution historical values. serve people don’t give rat’s ass whether die... want us back work make money. willing stop working stop buying products, us. that?  Aww let’s talk moving goal posts. that’s wanna go way ever compare. Double standard. NYC biggest hot spot international travel U.S. high population density. Long pandemic, experts predicted NYC (and rest NY via proximity) one areas affected pandemic. point didn’t really see raise numbers yet. early tell? easier U.S. contain virus. mentality ""it's late anyway"" probably one main reasons situation getting progressively worse. don't. However, think there's distinct difference contagious childhood diseases teachers get exposed measles chickenpox vaccines life-threatening adults COVID-19 know life threatening vaccine. type info (as late is) good Biden. living rock surprised new revelations said reply another person... Unfortunately, PA's genius gov sec health followed suit that... county PA, something near 80% deaths nursing homes. Nothing short murder. Something something depth warmth said stops catching virus

Yet mentioned daily thread. mention better methods going bring up

Already mentioned thread. often make comments without reading things first?

Like I've said before, one problems facing America pandemic extremes sides. developed nation issue America is.

Its simple, wearing mask help reduce transmission. shield stop getting virus. Headlines like suggest is, that's comment came from. Depends many people line front you. 3M 6200-series half-mask respirators (the kind filters sides) come three sizes: S, M, L. appear sporadically Amazon reasonable prices various sizes; wait large show up. 3M 7200 respirator shaped differently fits GF's small face better 6200.

I full-face respirator actually find comfortable half-masks. Mine Chinese clone 3M 6800/6900 accepts bayonet-style 3M P100 cartridges actually nicely constructed works well. 3M Honeywell full-mask respirators available multiple vendors $200-$300 variety sizes (the one bought early March $32 longer available vendor).

Though impossible find, many US-branded N95s (e.g., Milwaukee, 3M, Honeywell) cupped-design keeps mask completely face find comfortable cloth surgical masks. read 100% test subjects administered vaccine achieved high levels antibodies.

Where's source?

100% makes think trial small (&lt;100 individuals). Viral sprinklers, defined world-famous organ player Balboa Park. I'll never forget lol. Ive got family friends across Europe. They’ve reached asked timidly things here. relieved find appalled repulsed governments actions, too. 
My husband honeymooned Germany Austria. Salzburg, shared table Biergarten couple Vienna. introductions asked literally said “we Americans. Sorry country is... know...”
When visiting family Sweden one summer 12 13, heard aunts uncles chastise parents presidents actions (W Bush, 2nd term time) aunt later explained many Europeans hate Americans they’re always meddling. realized maybe America bit bully global politics. 
I’m glad coworkers reaching out. shows really care mean times. (if ever fucking ends) it’ll individual Americans repair international friendships. lot don't, unfortunately.

I live area that's popular American tourists, many still believe they're coming visit. shocked tell border closed they'll refused entry. I've planning moving new York since covid first hit changing mind. want move ever. Living city many people actually able work together help solve issue like state government actually gives shit? Sounds good me. literally best explanation went NY seen. Kudos. No, concept.

No, poor management hospital leaders, due worst pandemic 100 years global shortages PPE. Nothing hospital leader could done stop this.

They prepared practical so. stock much long. every hospital supposed build massive warehouse full years worth normal usage ppe, btw, expiration date? No. reasonable practical.

No, hook rules protect hospitals, individual providers times crisis care. rules hospitals would close treat anyone pandemic over. rules protect providers hospitals emergencies well, natural disasters etc.

It apples oranges.

Simple right? person fired failing follow normal ppe procedures time normal care,, rightfully fired. Yes? pandemic broke later date mean people rightfully fired, time fired.

Let's say pot illegal, person gets arrested pot pays fine, 2 years later pot becomes legal person still rightfully arrested fined based law time. law changed future mean due reconciliation.

Yes, signed this. part Healthcare provider. want out, quit. Literally one stopping you. either accept risk, don't. Iran Iran, escape COVID-19. Funny wasn’t saying month ago reason went “figured out” that’s viruses work. people it, that’s less people infect. agree this, point banking foreign interference support existing base.
If plan fails, least fucked country economy enough Biden blamed 2024 jr, Jared, Ivanka run president. so? Cos mean small town everything shut, roads pavements empty, parks empty dead good month initially. odd ""group park"" pretty much that. early long queues due distancing supermarkets. virus exposed stupid Americans really are. friend deserve award using Taylor Swift reference medical section Brilliant least say you’re young smart love !! important essential worker. doesn’t help watched news channel propagates anti science propaganda viewers eat like ice cream. Seriously gonna pretend NY handled situation *well*? place really hive mind times. jesus christ lol Ah see thank you! 2025 pandemic? Please seriously don’t know haven’t figured phones, Fitbits, OnStar, Waze, Google Maps already tracking them. quite gathering morons Unfortunately, PA's genius gov sec health followed suit that... county PA, something near 80% deaths nursing homes. Nothing short murder. I'm waiting right-wing nut say China's deliberate attempt depopulate Uighurs Xin Jiang... brother way. He's consumed conspiracies. comment proves people don’t actually read article posted, headline. LOL Yep happened early Brooklyn too, early pandemic. wearing mask get politicized🤔 2 days couple days ago Oh means waste resources then! didn’t know I’d something important sports! breaking away? think they're going override Trump's veto? Republicans also trying force spending bill protections corporations people got sick business refuses follow CDC guidelines can't sue them.

90% Republicans support Trump, almost them, save someone like Larry Hogan.

They ability stop Trump got dangerous back February refused. Every single death Republicans Congress Republican Governors like DeSantis, Kemp, Stitt, Abbott, etc. ""I put bacon face. would leopard eat it? SHOCKED!"" do, like things, use different word it. Beaches called arenabozzles. hope recovers quickly become advocate mask wearing. think it’s easy forget American Revolution (1775-83) significantly predated French Revolution (1789-99). It’s also easy forget American Revolution judging subsequent standards French Revolution wasn’t really much one.

A colonial revolt sure enough short-lived exogenous conditions largely bought Britain colonial body almost equally supported home country blew quickly mostly far-off hemisphere. bit tax revolt, still rule rule. stayed changed (no bad thing). much compare something changed fundamental nature politics, economics society established hundreds years far-reaching impacts much world many years come.

There’s doubt France's debt, aggravated French involvement American Revolution, led introduction new taxation reduction privileges one immediate cause French Revolution. terms cultural, political economic financial causes, little nothing hadn’t place thinking independently long before. doubt even useful military lessons experience American Revolution certainly didn’t moderate French Revolution went it.

Would French Revolution occurred proceeded without American Revolution much way? Almost certainly, it’s impact minimal. Depends consider ""last time"". fight Ebola, example, going well. confirm. went local beach 20+ high school/college kids (that looked late teens early 20’s) hung together w/ distancing. Young guys bunch hot chicks talking, giggling, playing football, throwing frisbees tacking water, etc. it’s don’t care world. Dumb a-holes. realize global pandemic? Signs posted beach entrance tell folks stay 6 feet apart don’t live together. state 2 week + wait.... like WTF That's [cries Houston] Please let like herpes. *know* 5 months March, point immaterial purposes determining public policy.  Texas states lower population density, would expect implement similar safety protocols like NY?  _that_ different.

The previously badly hit areas US seem fine atm cases rising previously untouched areas. Mortality likely even nationwide over.

Sweden much smaller country wave homogeneous. thing is, suspect authoritarian regimes secretly fake numbers (like China, Iran, Russia). Trump would stupid openly admit it, announce advance too. highest hopes voted someone outside establishment. utter disappointment. Didn’t drain swamp, didn’t fix economy, ignores experts, rants social media like teenager. We. Are. Fucked. 

P.S. way Biden endorsement either. He’s creep. Elections sad one forced pick *least worst* candidate instead best one. Crimes humanity. Seriously. Wait....what here? I'm upstate working retail, everyone wears mask I've heard complaints. People hate Walmart's ""go way aisle"" lot though. learned chose opposite. Even politican charge drooling mouth breather mind gnat, teams people behind 'em heavy thinking state would get nothing done - whether constructive majority citizens another issue. Look political goals party currant occupants white house achieved. 

This means deliberate mindfully chosen moves states refused shut long enough, refused require masks distancing upon opening, etc.

The least immoral reason think believe get herd immunity way. horrible enough accepting minmum 1% deaths population, cost care, unknowns duration severity effects infection even asymptomatic survivors, deaths injurties get timely treatment hospitals overwhelmed covid19 patients. Indeed. one really needs imaginary reasons sleep well, can’t see one supporting you. Evil ignorant idiot Oh boy, get worse? Thank explanation!

In part it’s manpower problem? government provided leadership would also make sure adequate staffing data could entered databases. Without pulling hardworking hospital employees emergency tending staff patients. nothing ""desperation"" - ridiculous inane spin accusation. British propaganda. historical fact well known, obvious undeniable. 

You may want live disney land revolutions great super awesome - usually happens people addicted short term satisfaction - history reality show different truth.

And also - American revolution inspiration French one. im American, thats history you.

- Downvoting doesnt change facts. makes expose incoherent, ignorant resentful connards. :) I'm expecting this.  First all, think flu season considered over. Fever fatigue two possible symptoms. I'd try get tested, least, get quarantined tested. covid causing. cant reopen thingns expect thinngs go back normal. Investors sector contracts nothing. I’m sure youll find something u keep looking. make sure benefits good enough. 42.4% obesity US. 140,000,000 people higher risk. NY NJ worst death rates planet. Density airport don’t excuse early infection doesn’t excuse hit long crisis Europe already started, continent worst hit country (Belgium) death rate half NYs. 

To pretend like NY cuomo good job say don’t care many people die democrat charge you’ll support them. axe. getting pizza, can't. Pizza easiest thing possible get delivered oppose mask ordinance. Karen year, one. Dont need fear, DumSantis fine job ...Didn’t NY/NJ highest death rate country? live movie Idiocracy. like want afford food...  lockdown strict comparison countries lockdown 1. state brought daily infections 10k day 1k day. means something right. No. Other. State. That's Fauci saying.
2. hospitals capacity. tough call states may make decision too. 20% NY COVID-19 deaths nursing homes (which lower national average).
3. NY got hit early hard. past several months treatments COVID-19 improved thus death rates coming (thank God). states' doctors get benefit NY doctors learned. thus lower per capita deaths.

But yeah sure bud. NY reacted like Florida. I'm sure everything would turned great. love Fauci let actual CDC director step role he's currently Infectious Disease head. knew wtf going happen Trump charge stepped front train himself.

Now he's like, fuck it, gloves off. He's good man I'd love see get presser say, 

'You know what, fuck it, quit, America.'  true Republicans Congress Republican Governors. partisan issue, Republicans allowing catastrophe continue. it’s distributed throughout country, process going actually getting vaccine itself? Assuming health care workers high risk individuals already it, going kind “schedule appointment pharmacy” thing, government facilitating process randomly? Sure, buddy. Whatever helps sleep night.

Have good one. 1) bracing NY 140,000 hospitalizations 53,000 beds. 

2) order left hospitals decide whether could safely discharged. kick hospitals. become new doctor would ravage hard can't regenerate? Let tell time tendon left ankle snapped first semester college treated sprain go doctor surgery final semester college four years later fix it. Washington state learned it. First cases US, started work home voluntary shut-down really early. Cases never spiked Seattle anywhere near New York experienced weeks later.

I think kind odd New York getting praised hit massively hard entirely avoidable, but...I guess that's still better states? Even though states still reached New York levels severity, AFAIK. anyone know masks helping

My parents believe masks don’t work like flu “they” going making us vaccine attend schools No, he's getting even people happier childhoods did. That's everybody. dead Americans happier Trump.

Edit spelling train ride like 40 mins I’m NYC Bronx like 5 days week alright guy lots studys posted reports first hand sub White, liberal, retired gun-owner 50s, here. I'm waaaaay afraid angry white men black people. Black people right angry, IMO.

To put another way, feel much safer seeing crowd masked black men coming toward street bunch cops. April possible get test high risk group? Florida May. They're really gunning #1. vanity thing.We imagine day take ginormous poop toilet flush it- praying goes down.lol
Another reason dont fart either.
Its true...men let one loose, apologize, think nothing it. ladies scarey reality. know people had/have virus (it even themselves) need information guidance. girlfriend spiked fever almost 103 nowhere afternoon uncommon get sick exhaustion (we recently went back work stressful plus suffers insomnia), definitely alarming. complaining muscle soreness well told stay home rest sounds like normal flu symptoms I'm gonna lie say panicking like crazy inside.

I'm curious kind symptoms common familiar virus. many similarities general influenza COVID hard know urgent serious taken. Obviously fever break gotta seek medical attention anyway just... know handle this. world want anything bad happen her, I'm barely reassuring let alone myself. need insight something. Well, one need scientist understand why. People tend meet people age interests.

If live multe generational household, combine different groups spread groups. Obviously, don’t. imaginary reasons. Honest inquiry. worst hit state correctly? backlog number mean? 61,988 tests sitting queue 16th processed reported them? daily positivity number processed? I'm confused sorry.

Like posts data way, thanks this. yeah .01% noteworthy. anecdotal evidence weighed 99.99% people reinfected. 

If handful stirs worries, inherently unreasonable taking dat slippery slope. I’m sure there’s non-island country Earth that’s gone 30 days without new cases since whole thing started. lingo. Everyone said crazy Pizzagate. it’s true even worse Wayfair Amazon selling kids. everyone opening eyes seeing SAID TRUE! Now, first Dr FRAUDci says don’t wear mask. said wear mask. FRAUDci? we’ve learned anything Rothschild Clinton’s it’s stop nothing start NWO. They’re trying use reverse psychology use man made virus wipe us out. Insert link. want us confused question get sick die worse, need vaccine. Don’t sheep research. Insert link again.. Walk away. Profit. image. Hmmm. That’s definitely true lot states. attitude doesn’t help anyone, you’re part making partisan issue. teachers need worry themselves. selfish cunt society get fucked learn hard way like want to.  point, Trump administration wants Americans die. made clear incompetence willful malice. DaRe You?!?!

We Asshats proud noble people disavow affiliation spunkwaffles like Gov Dipthong. If, 21 years old, cannot understand ""If thing, family die, therefore thing,"" something terribly wrong brain's development. mother died 4 understood coming back. 21 year old good enough grasp death know avoid something cause it, should.

tl;dr excuse. people likelier smarter too... think actually pretty small part population. 

But unfortunately, passionate voters entire system voting built favor them. 

The hope remote working become norm progressive people spread throughout country start voting places currently red. Houses cheaper there, all. guys beaches uk?

I thought guys went Spain that.  spike daily cases mass testing. spike single day since they're reporting daily.

I'll make clearer. sufficient enough increase account 300 cases regular case load across rest numbers 50-80 cases day. numbers tend trend downwards things get better.

So saying Wuhan mass testing certain baseline...and Wuhan testing large drop (75% so) number asymptomatic cases across country...

And Wuhan testing finished, asymptomatic cases rest country doubled previous low.

In perfect lockstep? That's countries beginning tested people symptomatic, effectively means asymptomatic people counted.

I aware still beginning.

Contact tracing means blanket tests people location. People need showing symptoms get tested long many places.

Are still stuck February? Maybe March? Gorlami Literally 12% deaths NYC? Cuomo real bringer death. funny 
when say ""Dems politicizing COVID"" politicizing COVID. kinda satisfyingly dense. How’s picking sick deceased patients firefighter/EMT “supposed make feel”? feels awful. Fuck bullshit tell people assume virus seasonal assume get long term immunity, say ""oh course assume things, probably acts like lot viruses, pessimist.""

But tell people kids probably spread too, like viruses, sudden assume can't.

The truth always convenient. Long time ago, put kids cages. read data somewhere showing genX age group resistant wearing masks followed millenials? young age groups, ""young"" compared elderly.

I would think mask wearing easy measure seriously person taking this. Good point, thought would least hold American kids like movie level villainy, movie 'evil president' villain would compelling motivation cover deaths 'not wanting look like loser front despot friends' Wow. interesting bit scary. knew Dengue get worse exposure. glad making sure don’t make mistake vaccines SARS-CoV-2, creating mess. It’s part process. Oh, comprehended fine. saying. don’t see we’re blaming youth government. Hard care something president tells months it’s nbd It’s embarrassing frightening. They’ll hide real numbers unfortunately, plenty Americans going believe it’s longer threat. Sigh. read, reason loss smell occurs virus attacks epithelial cells around olfactory nerve, causing inflammation. inflammation compresses nerve point impacts totally blocks signals. person recovers, swelling goes sense returns normal.

Given fact children's sinuses significantly different adults, would make sense symptom would less reliably expressed?

Similarly, infection work way along olfactory nerve regions - would makes sense balance would totally borked inflammation around inner-ear, pink eye could similarly due virus attacking eye.

Has lung capacity returned? Even Asymptomatic people shown ""ground-glass opacities"" associated reduced lung functionality. Fauci guy think is, want see credentials. Show us birth certificate. Meanwhile, many states testing results 10 14 days, spikes % positive 15% 23%+ (arizona 3 % contacts traced 90-100% ccu beds used.)

Trump=Sickness Death - true campaign message.  told us protesting outside safe didnt cause anyone get corona. beach dangerous compared that? way. else friends Jeffrey. He’s terrific guy, say likes ladies much do. Many younger side.  That's years less national average. article notes average age new cases 15yrs lower before. forcing corona virus patients nursing homes vulnerable giving nursing home execs immunity lawsuits regards corona virus deaths right way? think 8500+ deaths tell different story. better keep away books there's one '/s' notation book ever read. worst death rates world outside perhaps Lombardy can’t explained density alone used work Walmart, straight told us sick excuse missing work absolutely would accept doctors notes. 

If threw front manager, would send home you’d get strike missing work. Not: 6 different symptom clusters, unique viruses/mutations. studied symptoms. different clusters arise exposure. Imagine 32,000 citizens dead virus spreading country rich, privileged millennials going back mommy. PRAISED complete failure disregard health well-being. Fauci crock. always anecdotal evidence people able afford something need health. know truly can't afford made poor spending choices. 

im taking privileges granted... im presenting perspective european thinks americans go bankrupt die homes get sick. made specific reference state think shit-hole needs fix shit. I'm health care reforms we've started. think long way go make best world. wore mask, would cover super cool piercings, duhhh /s people keep saying ""wait two weeks"" two years now.  hudson valley pretty okay. Lol hey French Revolution set stage democracy.

""Globally, French Revolution became focal point development modern political ideologies, leading spread liberalism, radicalism, nationalism, secularism, among many others, accelerating rise republics democracies""

Led Napoleon. explains New York 10% antibody positive tests vs 1.2% population virus... actually can’t imagine would happened Cuomo shut in, say, Feb people country even acknowledging here. People would freaked federal response would totally discredit him, without evidence silently spreading unmitigated way, people wouldn’t taken seriously. NY economy fell cliff shut it’s pretty important country globally. I’m sure, without hard evidence Covid, even Cuomo tried shut big businesses - even financially - would complied without fight. Nobody would ok losing jobs shutting looked like everything still fine. needed testing months earlier could say “see? Shut down.” Took forever get tests places country still don’t easy access. pure evil Damn... mean future getting kids house parents work and/or peace. Kids fine home home school better 30 person classroom. smartest well adjusted people I've met homeschooled. purely parents. opposite day? There's way flu vaccine could increase odds getting COVID 19.

Walking hospital drug store filled people receive vaccine, though...  64 years old.

This would good chance lot boomers retire. Make room seniority lists younger people. ""I'll leaving country we're able to"". Reading comprehension. important. see sporting smile shit eating variety deriving Asia.""

Why ""Asian""?

EDIT: genuine curiosity word ""Asiatic"" (a word rarely ever see used) getting downvoted. read study Melatonin reducing cytokine storm. look it.  longer incompetence misconstrued such. actively sacrificing thousands lives slimmest hopes messaging changed enough influence election. banana-republic dictator-level malice villainy.

Someday grandkids going ask President could allowed directly interfere deadly pandemic cause many unnecessary deaths I'm going respond ""honestly, still idea.""

Edit: grammatical errors I'm going blame autocorrect really weird beer drinking.  Finger prick enough.

I finger prick test milk blood finger enough gather test thing. 

15 minutes later, negative. think (most) young people US took seriously first. Old people didn’t. Young people said screw it, thing supposedly won’t kill I’m gonna live life. we’re here. love living dumbest country world.  Lmao. ""Liberate"". country policies hated worldwide. country done liberating, they've created terrorist groups killed millions civilians. Open eyes typical, ignorant American. In-correct. Everything scientifically points re-infecrion. least months (probably longer infection anything passed extremely mild), inflamed immune response people's bodies fighting virus. 
People tested positive viral RNA still present, mean active infection occurring. forget majority deaths caused covid. death presence covid. get car accident die, covid, marked covid death. heart attack, covid, death marked covid.

Additionally, roughly 80,000 undiagnosed cancer patients result slowdown/stoppage non-medically-neceessary screenings. looks exactly I’d imagined. guy starting broken microphone. says exactly says keep stating obvious common colds rhinoviruses. Maybe 20% coronaviruses. north east, experience it’s 2 degrees separation someone probably 3 someone died It’s true, mask care people dying. want look good upcoming election trying strategy sticking fingers ears saying LaLaLa pretend bad things exist. Sadly lemmings falling thing. Lol nurses lower average mortality. safer lots jobs

It's well paying job benefits pension. want it? Lots people. Covid requested day week. Request granted.   sad lives y'all live Yes, thank you! Adults always putting down, saying ""You'll wait older achieve dreams."" surprised yurt village open visited couple weeks ago. place looks like prime space spread virus among tourists.  Frankly, it’s going politicized matter what. it’s delayed election, Republicans going claim purposely held back.

Edit: clear, truly wish wouldn’t politicized; it’s everything concerning virus US. Yeah. think problem. try something get bored within 15 minutes there’s point. Ive never fan sitting quietly home; need see people, make plans. Can’t really right now. i’m extrovert energy zapped. I’ve turned TV shows intro song first episode finishes. I’m holding next summer start feeling something again. not, well, I’ll figure something out.

Out meme cycles we’ve last couple years, cutesy day-drinking bathrobes quarantine shit far worst. Like, you’re telling supposed life? 100%.

It's kids blame, parents send in. Every kid loves day school, even they're sick miserable. parents freaking sudden parent while. long throwing positions without backing I’m going say disagree you.

Well that's either us here. We're voicing opinions. Disagreeing absolutely fine, that's one best things destroying planet governments governed capitalism chance stop it

Greed destroying planet. Consumption destroying planet. aware living China, that's consumption-ist society.

Yes capitalism promote materialistic need, that's part human nature. desire more, more. takes us back primal need. seen across animal kingdom too, gluttony there.

As comments US, agree. situation sustainable long dollar global currency. china's economy stabilises, currency manipulation stops, yuan push rival it. Perhaps even earlier that, euro will.  
People refusing wear masks mandatory tour covid unit. would waste PPE. problem politician charge party belong try right things. Trump taken covid seriously, might complain felt enough, would totally different. called hoax, tried slow testing, made states go bidding wars stuff, etc.  No. Partially hyperbole, partially people don’t come say way. say want mask requirements, next circle jerk terrible baseball restarting, Disney World open severe restrictions, people go beaches. right now, Americans cannot afford something Americans can? stop Americans enjoying something Americans can? advocating for? say show people video bodies photos inside ICU hospitals that's maxed out. would it, show people dead. 
Deniers think people dying, let's show them. seeing death rate .00032%, meaning 99.997% children survive. would mean entire USA (320 million) got virus death rate we’d see 100k deaths. I’m saying isn’t tragic, statement young essentially safe true numbers perspective. confirms lockdowns don’t work. correct strategy beginning everyone wear mask, Fauci Jerome Adams bungled message. HIPPA rules health privacy would got around, seemed become desensitized imagery screens. see lots death, violence, war, poverty, seem real many people. Oh Abbott, silly rabbit, still using tactics won’t save day - Backwards responses rising cases, overflowing hospitals wrong places - Texas burning you’re caught holding match, every response merely patch - raging situation fuels devastation failing state nation live desperation - leadership fails around us, look maskless people bus - It’s become political - calling cynical - virus rages like rats cages ICU’s filling stages community rages obituaries fill pages - enough. Letting virus burn worst thing following advice Dr. ain’t flu - don’t silly Mr. Rabbit, today - know full state lockdown solution keep virus bay. *mic drop* Yeah, grocery pickup delivery (there free options live), masks basically walks something like gas station. outside wearing hour time, I’m worried may damaged point I’d better wearing cloth mask... always favor extra protection could it, starting wonder it’s really safer many reuses. talking newspaper days, no, goes sub absolutely nothing like that. save lives US regions forever-wars actually pretty good Indiana  could try, I’ve never really active type. Especially since live pretty crowded city. Correct I’m wrong haven’t studied shown opposite also Outside low risk. wouldn’t eat indoors that’s damn sure. Well, end day hire good people. even times people problem good work attendance, toxic individuals, let go behavior can't corrected. yeah...always start hiring someone good fit role, experience work ethic, also someone good attitude work well team.

Once team full individuals, basically shovel reasonable goal tell deliver good product, worry details happened. That's comforting. hope we'll ok. seriously....you're responding. Maybe reading lies. quite lot. would probably take time read them.  Hawaii many schools face face k-2 upper grades remote mix, slightly varies school Age factor younger people healthier immune systems able create effective response faster. matter virus caring. Thank you. definitely look it.  Everything revolves around dear leader, course! Yeah, lots unusual reporting lately, probably come. FEMA blitzes started Friday. Demand high expected, (good news maybe?), know numbers come in. federal help let state labs work backlog, there's mention that. 

We also know Sonora Quest switching new high-capacity system. possible they're pushing hard old system order focus effort getting new one running. Ski areas suffer whenever sub-par snow yield, let alone COVID impacts. huge ski areas might enough resources weather storm, worry smaller areas. Sorry harsh.

No USA wan influence idiots go example nonewnormal aware get downvoted oblivion.

Yes angry US goverment multiple reasons.

The conclusion war profiteer maybe quick maybe understand thought this.

This sub also high quality content. Maybe also try sub masks4all... 

I Apologize insults.

Stay safe Yes, I've never bothered get flu shot past definitely year. Every little bit helps lower hospital usage we're already dangerously close overloading now.  pretty slow Sunday. ??

Do strawman often? 

Going adaptive immunity gonna help much, evidence human bones show clearly much difference inherited resilience actually matters.

If humans genetic immunities, would vulnerable *everything* nature, including parasites likes ribeiroia ondatrae worms. 

Humans vulnerable everything nature, genes long since learned stop thousands different types pathogens, ""generations"" ""evolution"". seriously see overlook adaptive immunity tiny aspect that. could order DNA around, could simply tell body allow coronavirus infect all, instead **DNA** best produce white blood cells bone marrow, stop infection via **DNA** blueprints white bloodcells complete spreadsheet types pathogens bloodcell expect meet.

To say virus kill 0.5% population **dependent** everyone becoming immune stops infecting us. don't, start killing weak individuals. weaken healthy individuals. kill weakened previously healthy individuals. cannot gain herd immunity exposing virus gain herd immunity would need die **en masse**. *survivors* would ""small random inherited factors"" making *them* resilient pathogen. 

Human reproductive behaviour would **rebuild** population would *then* normalised immunity pathogen. seriously easy understand anyone complete denial evolution first place.

You claim flu bro, again, *as many formulations* come with. say shortly, say long winded, put idiots say put scientists say it. 

This pathogen DNA ever met before. overall populations earth carries ""small random inherited factors"" making resilient specific coronavirus. bodies react like native americans' bodies reacted disease brought europeans *reality* showing happen *hypotheses* claiming happen. can't leave either. dream though. dont find comparison convincing gay past. pandemic quite different ignorance thousands infect kill multiple thousands. please, let's stop throwing word privilege around. That's getting quite tiresome. risk death incredibly low gives shit jesus get lives damn bankrupting world nothing get hobby physical component like cycling? helped quite bit keep balance Thank much. hope loved ones safe healthy. NYC shut got near Texas's levels, meant lot precautions necessary, thankfully.

Texas refuses shut properly prepare, call pinch hitters Honest q: didn’t opt deadline? reason fucking article younger 10 years old around half likely adults spread virus.

Young children repeatedly shown resistant infection spread. question young obviously it’s true all. Regardless, read actual article next time. IMO teams soft-pedal kind stuff actually done vaccine safe, known work, provides long-lasting immunity, manufactured mass quantities.

Getting everyone whipped frenzy an. Imminent vaccine sides:

* People think ""oh, pandemic almost over"" stop public health things need every day. seen disastrous results mindset US.

* team feels increased pressure deliver likely take shortcuts, quietly ignore equivocal trials bad side effects, shout critics internal whistleblowers.

* vaccine ultimately pulled found unsafe, discredit entire industry talking point anti-vaxxers. 

Let's sure get right, meanwhile let's long haul. mean, toner ain’t cheap. kid 5'7 140lbs, assume symptom pattern look like adult's little kid's... That’s California. Back April avoiding even fast food drive thrus wiping every new item buy Lysol. cases worse ever, eating drive-thru food sticking stuff cabinets without wiping first. Randers... Twitter Youtube getting better blocking flagging. Zuckerberg needs held accountable. senate hearing joke. 

I'd love see someone power money like Bill Gates take ""news"" sources peddle pandemic (and other) conspiracies. Think guy convinced Pizza gate real drove DC loaded weapons ""save kids pedos"" rots jail kids father. Yes, dumbass... junk news new meth, meth dealers arrested crimes. remember reading somewhere even developed vaccine wouldn’t way administer world doesn’t enough syringes distribute widespread vaccine, least anytime soon Also ask doctor get pneumonia vaccine. correct putting infected people elder care facilities spread virus ? feel lady. 63, asthmatic, life risk everyday assholes $10 hour. country failed her, level ignorance, enforcement personal opinion health expense others, lack leadership (with bile nonsense spewed Trump today) also terrible support systems feels needs $10 hour. literally can't rush vaccines side effects show months. That's indisputable fact. That's observe happens. can't give people put time machine see happens 6 12 months road. Keep chasing pipe dreams I'll listen experts seems likely less likely time goes past. First suspicions March. 5 ideals greed, cruelty, selfishness, corruption, deception.

You witnessed 3 article. first two selfishness cruelty. care kill clerk, want inconvenience sacrifice slightest.

But man yelling ""ADA Exception"", encounter 3rd ideal: Deception.

They liars, deceivers, truth them. ADA lie one invented may perpetrate evil upon society.

They demand **the right harm kill.**

The antimaskers bioterrorists. treated such.

No negation terrorists. think every America, 330,000,000 us Manhattan, New York, Manhattan, Kansas, support that? painting us brush different ""ugly American"" painting brush. There's lot difference Manhattan, NY Manhattan, KS, good people bad people each.  keep seeing shit. make sense, gotta use right! can't cover mouth nose. one other.

Hurricane season here.

Keep eye next days possible development Gulf; there's potential system watched. August also peak season, always interesting month.  anxiety also gone manageable severe. healthcare, highly recommend seeing therapist telehealth appointments. copays coinsurance right therapy really helped times start spiraling I've never wanted someone right something entire life. 😮 Imagine ELEMENTARY SCHOOL! Ehh problem. Someone asymptomatic issues past 4 months height covid-19 don’t see would ever get vaccine especially evidence asymptotic harm doubt does. 

If person gets vaccinated person B asymptomatic get vaccinated issue. 

I won’t getting vaccine. wear mask 24/7 outside stay indoors otherwise. I’m definitely injecting something make person feel safer. see huge argument happening. many kids come school obviously sick fevers vomiting immediately call parents come get them. don’t pick up, don’t come get kids. sick kids sit nurses office day come back school (still sick policy) next day. Coronavirus going spread like wildfire environment like that. preschools closed?  Seriously?

Is anything done all? things like O2 therapy, antibiotics, blood thinners etc?

This first I've heard chilling.. people know voting currently circulating lies pandemic like crazy. think antibody test count active case, one person getting multiple test result multiple cases, think test 50% false positive, seem know 1-4 people went test left getting got call two days later saying positive, also seem know doctor nurse sent unused swabs came back positive. believe cotton swab contains virus that’s many negative first time positive second time. Others think covid19 test registers positive coronavirus. circle jerking Facebook “facts” day including mask don’t work. 

I feel like steering boat right toward eye cat 5 hurricane realize impeach president gross incompetence yes? paywall link: always felt nauseous kid, still it’s early. Certainly lots causes. kids anxiety, allergies (sinus drainage), gerd, want stay home. Point it’s hard tell it’s noro one causes. welcome. pretty exciting news considering many lives it'll save around world. China's already pledged make public resource. agree. Fear natural reaction danger. It’s survival instinct. People china fine, enjoy improved quality life, wealth prosperity last 10-20 years, happy us.  Go back Idaho fucks Let go. obviously needed somewhere vent frustrations even meant ignoring intended point. Chinese colleagues back January February. quite humbling receiving end. case you’re bit slow uptake, post wasn’t stellar review Trump. Put guns away... it’s caps, know it’s legit choice “do thing die,” behalf good people everywhere, please choose live. Get part time job park ranger something, beg, borrow, whatever, please live. 

We need good teachers next year too. I'm sure refrigerated trucks store piles bodies help either really, porous border UK Northern Ireland. Tourists also using way avoid quarantine checks. Im nobody civilian regular job lives regular life. knew virus far back November... regular nobody like knew back then, im pretty sure knew before.  I’ve heard teachers charging anywhere $600-$2000 month per student private tutoring school year starts don’t go back. tutor six students ten months $1000, $60,000 sounds better dealing parents. hehe.

Least around couple decades *with* commercial vaccines, compared players market.

Out interest checked commercial vaccines none ever registered Australia USA afaict, I'm sure Europe. Possible sublicensed sold different branding though. Eastern Washington, 50% / 50% Seattle early days actually surprised masks worn, etc. Granted, February/March, lot cities still flailing bit. WA looks trending wrong direction now, sadly, I'm sure great managing reopening.

Going outside ever risk I'm aware of, sunlight might actually provide net benefit vs minor risk, since outdoor transmission proven extremely rare, especially masks distancing.  Lol no. elderly people nursing homes got sick there, went hospitals recovery mode allowed return nursing homes. weren’t allowed return recovered would either filled bunch hospital beds like Italy causing death would effectively homeless. top needing continued medical treatment covid, people likely nursing home reason. needed bits care too. would add stress hospitals well much needed New York City. happens 50% success rate vaccine? Currently almost 100k cases day easily see 200k cases day. 

If vaccine works 50%, 20 million cases time people get vaccinated, 200k 300k cases day, mean still going 100k cases day vaccine? 

How 50% vaccine success rate totally eradicate corona virus 20 million people already it. gotten large, mutate, spread like flu? Even get vaccinated, 50% success rate, means 50% chance working every time vaccinated. eventually everyone get it? 10 times deadly flu really one ages. 

So ever eradicated spread like flu? many cases see year 50% vaccine success rate? wear mask pump? outside everyone far apart. asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

Why quote sound like, ""I incapable learning""? Yeah they're dirty communists made Bernie Sanders!\^/s

\^GoodJobVermont Yeah high death rate government fucking nursing homes top tier No. wiped due disease would big enormous loss face. Plus able tell people rest world well handling virus. 

They need coronavius take Uighurs. erase history pace. DeSantis enemy people. right California least think get hit hard fast NY. Look now. 


NY, NYC specifically path fucking insist opening schools fall like they're planning to. Fuck mitch mcconnell lindsey graham. start taking seriously. Boris getting probably helped turn things around a.fair bit. #Crack feels dirty compared good ole hallucinogens entheogens though. literally don’t. I’ve never understood need slapping /s every sarcastic statement someone makes online. I’ve literally never problems discerning what’s sarcastic what’s not. It’s pretty obvious someone suggesting weed could cure corona serious. sickening we're even situation something preventable nations able handle like adults. Trump creep? list 25 sexual assault allegations.  Mr Prime minister Majestys United kingdom Great Britain, Northern Island overseas territories you. do. states cry states rights things get mandated dont like. Yeah cause mask makes immune COVID. Show (the way outta here) State! It’s insane trying rewrite history. people forget soon? fucking joke, grandmother died direct result Cuomo’s policies. Fear useful emotion, know harness it. lie virus? Nice Meet Highground User even know talking about? Ugh take upvote clever bastard Ill take fear Desantis I’m sure known back elderly risk... No, one quite clearly clue means, literal. curve, curve peak, goal push downward keep then.

The U.S. whole shaped like this: NY shaped like this: latter shape would liked see whole country look like.  curve flattened. level NY said done good job. 

The term metaphor something -- understanding relies solely ability look shape know describe it. agree *other* areas NY fucked up, undeniable pretty much sets standard crushing curve keeping low there. claim everything whole great something...just one thing. said afraid of. royally fucked notion up. No. Asian Brazilians, Mexicans etc. Yeah that's wearing mask works Democrats join override veto Yeah, I'm trying give us much credit. Culturally believe easier us adapt mask wearing. places reopen, many small buisnesses enforcing Mask Entry Rule, I'm sure eventually cases rise. Many people starting swarm beaches, people going back work, buses trains starting pack up. 

I'm entirely sure level stability eventually diminish. inevitable virus know post removed parent wasn't, also ""purely political"" answering question.  system unemployment totally fair definitely one taking advantage people want work, absolutely jobs there....that's MUST continue pay people triple salaries unemployment bonuses forever never circumstances give workers hazard pay!!!  deserve make work people sitting butts forever!

Excuse go vomit, I'm sick shit. Oh America, baby? might surprised learn UK actually biggest believers 5G theory, Americans.

Edit: Oh, France #1 anti-vaxx Pennsylvanian pretty red country here.... I've lost lot respect coworkers local friends. idea good it. Sounds like rounding impressive nonetheless.

Thank sauce. ""it affects whhhhhaaa"" New York essentially murdered old people could, sticking rona patients them, got deaths state, that’s want US be?

If “as well” New York, America would done San diego. Everyone wears masks seems pretty damn cautious general. thankful one braindead places like Florida north Carolina. asshat, hat offended comment sir. ass HOLE bit santorum. That’s worst part man. finally got anti-establishment candidate fucked bad probably won’t get another multiple elections. sitting February knew shit gonna happen looking Italy Spain yet governors somehow know care anyone wants read past headline, vast majority sub unfortunately , Fauci said ““New York got hit worse place world. correctly things you’re talking about,” continued.”

As well New Yorkers “I’m proud New Yorkers done. must continue alert,” 

Fauci even admits NY horrible beginning, it’s pretty clear talking steps quell virus, broad base numbers clearly said bad. hey, whatever. Hindsight always 20/20. horrible headline think CT Washington good jobs early on. Seattle flattened pretty quick given proximity NYC fact 16K people changed residences Q2 CT many people commute every day well unlike NJ. also don’t believe department health state would encourage people go outside addition mayor truly didn’t know whether safe. alone egregious, among many things. Fuck, vote retracted. Sorry. real hard time telling sarcasm asshattery online lately. hospitals full unknown reason. voted for. high infectious mortality rate cause panic. I'm sorry? understand point. 100s, 50s, 20s, 10s. think witnessed something called downtrend. Complicated, know.

Yeah, downward trend reversed soon Wuhan done counting. 

May 14th-31st 333 asymptomatic cases. 17 days 33 cases across rest like take back point impossible?

That nations test asymptomatic people? No. obvious countries contact tracing.

Ah, still stuck March. worry, things get better early hit countries. watch toilet paper hand sanitizer.

Anyway, good one. Stay safe. Can’t wait go back august 26...  Again, SARS MERS would, absent medical care, kill majority documented cases. incredibly severe disease. 

COVID produces vastly higher rate asymptomatic / mild infections ""moderate"" ones still nasty, pose minimal threat life people. also known produce widely varying antibody response, see noticable decline time period looking it. 

The severe COVID patients appear stronger response. also high rate least mid-term injury. great. 

People, especially critically ill, getting COVID would surprising. must say argument make interesting though. read study? highly recommend. Basically people afraid go outside followed social distincing protocols, however undeniable atrendees higher rates covid. Luckily us, former group much larger latter. Exactly We've confirmed cases work coworkers still think hoax.

How mentally ill think entirety world named donald trump coming get you? Casino employee here, it’s ridiculous amount people money thrown around. recently small dip numbers, idiots force pretty much every night. that’s sitting HOURS table people. Add fact Arizona California walking back reopen, everyone funneling Nevada’s casinos beaches Tahoe. 

We screwed Tahoe. Two months ago, didn’t personally know single person tested positive. week opened casinos (June 4th) three cases local grocery store, two casinos north shore (and that’s heard coworkers knew individuals). Fast forward last week, husband came home work south shore casino list 10 12 coworkers quarantined contact testing. far, two positives couple quarantined coworkers pretty sick. Several positives various bars around town. Yesterday, townhouse neighbor good friend danced away us dog (poor thing loves doesn’t understand won’t come pet her) brother/roommate tested positive. Currently, tests taking 10 days come back. 

Lake-wide, average something like 25,000 year round residents, two main population centers making 20,000. Last heard back April May, begging tourists stay away (and shaming didn’t), grand total 9 ICU beds 7 ventilators. sure either, definitely enough handle tsunami that’s hit tiny community. Medical community scientist: trust us! 

Also medical community scientists: confirmed teenagers human. violence. us angry poor decisions Covid19 pandemic feel sort action. Peaceful protesting? Idk. Best thing would resign, mean? Pence takes over? many questions have. seems hopeless really. hope find interesting information. Reality liberal bias. manageable baseline, anymore 5% however im worried also cough sneeze wild abandon. Kids talking start coughing sneezing straight zero warning attempt cover up. yeah science right? Hard agree! work really great school, colleagues working recontextualize courses direct students utilize community assets learning full time school usually cuts that. honest, traditional school really benefit majority students. classrooms often constrained system. Many teachers hoping forced change open door new formats learning public schools better serve students. majority, rushed vaccines caused problems. pandemic, it’s question balancing risk That's universal then. best become 2020 baby. double last sunday's count 45, bit less double prior sunday's total 29. It’s right article, prove what? Tegnell seems pretty hot least, e.g. [this March 16 titled *Anders Tegnell praises British idea herd immunity: ""Where need get.""*

[Region (one administrative regions) apparently get memo either. slide translates ""Goal Herd immunity. Method = Braking slippery road. Protect vulnerable!""

If view naturally-acquired herd immunity unavoidable tailor strategy introducing particularly hard measures, might well call goal, official not.

Edit: [Here's April 1 Region Norrbotten press from. [news guy also illustrates early thinking. least [he's doubts “We don’t want children get us, teacher, don’t want go funerals,” said Brosius

I doubt worry much thanks idiots government maliciously stupid. many dead people even funerals. find even disgusting I’m heavily downvoted pointing poorly people treated.

You're downvoted attitude, content. happens. need ""disgusted"", fake internet points. I'll say again, I'm rallying behind broken system, I've seen lot peers making piss money away put position. I've also flat broke, eating beans, wondering I'd able pay apartment lights month.  

We need fix broken system, also need teach sound financial literacy. starting see quite states shift PTO, corporations heart problem. They’re humans. Humans get transmit viruses. 

Have disbelievers never around toddler?  sick two years straight kid went daycare. Actually looks spreading information. going get proof, proof, numbers CCP claims accurate 100% false. No.

Getting mangled death car wreck surely fun either keep many people roads.

People assume happen them. stop Facebook. part, European countries start opening things back virus already quite low levels population.

For example, UK right estimated around 1 2300 people infected. means relatively unlikely come across someone virus. European countries likely even less COVID-19 population.

The US much shorter less strict lockdowns, virus get chance get low levels within population, moment people started going started spreading like crazy.

You also need look different states differently. experience New York (whose curve different European countries) different states Florida Texas.

Edit: forgot mention many European countries Test, Trace Isolate programs place. UK, test positive COVID-19 asked provide details anyone close contact recently, they'll told self-isolate two weeks case. allows many infections stopped even happen. *Official cases. also especially liked medicine dosage stuff related PhD work expertise. That's infection rate numbers tell me. outdoor UV index FL high enough kill virus? Would level UV cause skin related problems too? seen things people believe. Dumpsters fire shoulder Interstate. watched Karens go maskless dark near Covid gate. moments remembered scientists... like tears rain... Time die. Ya, could've studied instead turning blank paper hoping everybody forgets tests later. Absolutely agree. media hype something like fuels mistrust. Wait autopsy--then tests positive covid cause death, write story. 

I want parents less cavalier, lied to. Crisis actor corpses. never school actual nurse. young, ""nurse's office"", bunch pamphlets students' medication locked up. could ask secretary needed meds, needed pad bandaid. never nurse. heard one came public health while.

If got sick day, got sent principal's office puke garbage parents could reached come pick up. Fuck CCP they're new version Nazis oppressing Muslims like putting concentration camps serious day coming. World war 3 hand China left desolate barren. Fuck CCP! Free Muslims! Free Hong Kong! free Chinese people! God bless world! know talking about. virus majorly spreads particles originating saliva oropharynx, unless symptoms like coughing sneezing quarantining home anyways. Oral washes gargling proven bring value enveloped viral particles saliva oropharynx 0 takes 1 hour particles go back normal.

In theory frequent oral washes would superior asymptomatic carriers wear cloth masks. security guard outside door local Walmart. Makes feel better since live town lot people think hoax. think still thing. saw one posted reddit past week so. fairness pretty sizable country. I'm saying _if_ false test patient COVID-19, would false negative false positive like comment above. Honestly unless someone worked school don’t think truly appreciate it’s hard return safely way things currently sent up, won’t change. 

Barely substitutes, even so, safe moving building building?
That’s outbreaks nursing facilities happened, workers shifting locations day. That’s ridiculous even enough.

And ones many times older I’m sure they’re trying risk lives year like usual.

There’s many issues I’m fairly wealthy district. cannot imagine lower income districts able manage, ones need building since online often reach them. people believe free hard.

Was taxpayer money human science took us moon? No, pulled real hard bootstraps jumped. anything _really_ want it, also choose want things, fucking fault can't something. 

So think, act.

I think something ADHD-like. lot stuff trouble sounds kinda like ADHD.

There's two hot takes this:

- ""ADHD fake choose jump moon anyway like normal people do, lazy.""
- ""ADHD real, diagnosed. choose jump moon anyway like normal people do, lazy.""

They believe humans 100% rational 100% time, that, we're able make _good_ choice often list choices range bad worse worser.

It's hilariously misguided harmful. US currently 20% world's incarcerated population.

They less free every single country planet.


The brainwashing propaganda must really effective there's still people calling US land free.


It's simply impossible country highest incarceration rate per capita well absolute numbers even remote suggest country free. ~~FaUcI~~ cUoMo??? two unrelated companies. 

Just suspicious coincidence branding products similar.

Woolworths Australia unrelated company former Woolworths USA well.  Beyond height, would imagine parent's actions relevant. young children constantly running around wiping boogers other, they're also constantly wiped parents. Reminded wash hands. generally given extra measures protection.

I imagine parents would pulled 12 children sports, playdates, social events moment COVID labeled pandemic. Even regular flu seasons normal practice. US averages 7 cases bubonic plague year.  claim died overdose, lead Pretty easy find evidence motivation going become common cold. 

The 1918 flu 1)had death rate 10% significant evolutionary pressure lower (dead hosts can't spread virus) 2)flu changes readily recombination, host infected time two different flu viruses assembly instructions host cell gets mixed up, swine birds huge populations constant contact humans.

The covid19 virus devastating modern society overwhelms health care systems (average hospital stay 3 weeks huge), sub-1% death rate significantly affect transmission. recombination coronaviruses super rare: 4 cold-causing ones stable decades able sequence DNA, animal reservoirs like bats minimal contact humans. clearly indicated linked article, amount antigens indication anything. idea import vaccine better purely prejudice supported by... even doctors clinics offer Influvac

... idiotic ""insurance"" system incentivize clinics prescript expensive stuff unnecessary treatment. That's well known problem.

In either case, original reply implying Russian vaccines dangerous, source BBC article contains vague concern local flu vaccine effectiveness (and admitting flu vaccines poor effectiveness). doubts even live Russia WW2, allied soldiers marched local population nazi concentration camps, they‘d see eyes happened there. Holy shit. That’s terrible. retelling worded funny though. lol! 

I went first week grade 7 new school shingles. Didn’t know was, serious pain itching. covered blisters mom thought bring dr. 2 weeks home isolation. second generation virus infectious first generation virus. spring celebration. 

The ccp provided samples first generation nobody else ever got sample freely Wuhan. 

Just like ccp tried say virus came somewhere else China, claim second generation virus come China. 

And ccp *just successful* claiming second generation virus come wuhan, saying virus came somewhere else first place. realize none confirmed right? No. 

Just ask people asthma still start smoking. purely anecdotal based one trip local Walmart morning, majority customers clearly wearing masks get door. also ignoring one-way aisles social distances. majority workers saw bad customers—masks around neck nose hanging out

I shaking time left. sure expected anything different. Schools closed Finland, Sweden. plan never herd immunity never be, get facts straight. Dude, sick shoobs et. al. work Philly live Jersey, July 4th anyone west suburbs work could talk ""goin shore."" elderly in-laws inland LBI they're terrified. friend contracted Covid wedding hotspot south. people crazy. Uhh... could tested proved lot earlier.

I think knew didn’t tell us people wouldn’t hoard masks. requires reading, something anti-maskers probably do.  Standard situations, discharge stable people nursing homes. 

im aware. friend mid 40s spend six weeks nursing home ankle surgeries (car accident). actually defended Cuomo first. 

I really appreciate explanation. Sounds like people going die delayed hospital admittance didn't, contribute nursing home deaths did. think may changed mind again. 

I think Cuomo going able dodge negative publicity this, nuanced. He's smart take hit apologize. Agreed, people deniers facts available - they're deniers truth scary awful comfortable believe lies. facts videos change that. us won't. Sorry mean half mask referred above. plastics would degrade oven? Thats point, examples. Finally good news ! Thanks op :) they're rushing hide numbers U.S. school starts. good one.

I hope get disciplined breaking SOPs ""endangering fellow officers public"" choosing non-lethal route. happening ""everywhere"". MIS-C still exceedingly rare. Again, proof people pro-science pro-data undermines wishful perceptions. I'm going research force president resign. I'm positive Congress Senate make happen, imagine martyrdom there. all, according crazed ones, chosen god take pedo-ring stop new world order happening. Covid God's washing machine? Aaaarrgghhhhhhh Summer, Tourism. Well duh friends also trying hang out, I’ve avoiding them. Anyone spending time others indoors/unmasked contributing problem. also coworkers going restaurants gym - it’s unbelievable. Soooo much ignorance lol That's unfortunate. Maybe another 400+ deaths change people's minds? Every single state around us anywhere 173% 439% deaths per capita do. Even Canada country that's done much better US 161% deaths per capita state. try impress upon ""it's flu"" ""muh freedom"" people talk seem bad bad here...yet. lot room growth good way. expecting see onlyfans /r/Coronavirus reason place US surging saw China shut economy down, saw Italian hospitals ran, New York list goes on. asked explain low new cases Urban centers some1 posted surprise new cases centered urban centers places listed places cases total per capita close 0.2% deaths population estimated places 25% population infected easily explains it. said explain Hanoi, Singapore, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo etc comment would've made sense. consistent US major urban centers US either seeing spikes cases already seen spikes cases. list 2 random events could happen BFE farmland virus could still spread....will $hit....but frequency events virus could spread much higher urban centers mass transportation, dense office space, dense shopping, frequent restaurants, denser living spaces. really understand trying disagree increase new cases centered around urban areas.  Sure increasing crazy areas Arizona, orange county florida people wearing masks...but cases still spiking areas (I'm bay area) people got tired lockdowns sending kids daycare still socializing ""only"" ""close"" friends. problem little people seem take seriously unless hits some1 close US trying say? Skewed how? People wearing masks respecting laws corona automatically dismissed hospitals. Let people following laws go first. ridiculous allow people say, ""Muh freedumbs!"" get medical care risked many others may also need care. Buried WAY ARTICLE....""boy tests negative"". morons. Wake up. That's great, feel like VT laundry list advantages achieve superlative this. Haha... last job 104 hours sick time year rolled over. longer term staff 200+ hours banked. could get paid take (only vacation).

 
And yet, people still came work sick. live city US. 200k population. Two major hospitals reported days ago current number covid patients hospitals. zero. Ah, sad troll, then. Got it. Ok good, like theory. resigning then? gf works Publix, want get sick pay co worker diagnosed reset team. two worked next other, Publix employees wear masks store open.

The people stocking, overnight, wear masks.

They dont anything sanitize store either, like wipe down, disinfect grocery boxes.

So lady reset team got Covid knows where.

And gf wanted get tested, said voluntary isolation, letting use PTO sick pay.

She's going get pay two weeks. one eat mask though, they're gonna take em eventually know might sound weird hell onions smell taste completely different since march lockdown started spain.During time sinus infection possibly covid spent month able taste smell anything. 
Its really strange cant find info high false negative rate tests don’t get either. I’ve staying home much possible, many friends partying like nothing happening. It’s like live alternate reality. 

On top neighbors huge birthday party kid right next door, right next other, distancing found. even long term problems getting coronavirus. Even asymptomatic, could long term problems like lethargy, exhaustion, susceptibility pneumonia, etc. definitely something kids think about. dying age 13 trigger testing even repeating test COVID? should... poster ever respond back? Yes, agree policy good security helpful. However, Walmart stores need follow mask policy. example, customer refuses wear mask inform “greeter”actually called Health Ambassador, Ambassador suppose notify store management customer entering store without mask. manager suppose grab box masks greet customer inform mask policy policy place ask would like complimentary mask? course, still refuse, told stop customer shopping. fine, don’t expect management escalate situation turn violent. follow protocol get customers comply mask policy. don’t appear following protocol locations. good employees customers like. Yes weird side effect pandemic lately I’m disappointed everyone wants hook me. 57 confirmed staff child cases N. S. Carolina.  
1 Tucson.  
64, split half half children staff, Massachusetts. 
Texas 226 confirmed staff cases 113 pediatric cases spread across 270 open child care centers.  
 

The day cares pretty much constant exposure sites. literally one article, localized areas, dozens more. But, yeah, kids get spread it, worried? what's concerning day care kids, age 13 cases, little kids, supposedly spread it. School's gonna shitshow. haven’t new laws requiring paid sick days everyone, including part time workers - think probably not? bipartisan too, part human nature. friends donkey's take seriously, yet lot seem exercise degree cognitive dissonance justify risks, dismiss fears, etc. even striking since see much end even localized group think before. 

I'm saying I'm guilty ways well, I'm human all, given nature works likely know unless someone points natural response defensive one protect ego, often making problem worse. Wow. That’s control? Damn. I’d love 100 cases US on-point comment far, really. Including ones. People follow safe guidelines time pandemic going home vacation. safer ways vacation many take precautions.

We going short vacation days concerned. going midweek rural area, renting place stay bringing food. masks sanitizer well staying away anyone see hiking. Seriously either anxiety disorder severe asthma. Go doctor immediately. Incidentally, doctor see spent many many hours life wearing surgical masks high stress situations, won’t get much sympathy there. Also related: *lose* everything, deserved it.


Good ole America. understanding summer south means people inside use AC. basically destroys entire argument summer helps.

My understanding logic summer helps is:
- People spend lot time outside
- Outside less risky good air circulation
- Also people spread more. places go. COVID-19 shows differently children adults. Vomiting definitely common symptom children. 

I hope get definitive answers autopsy closure. read one yesterday. Apparently Karen sign paper saying would stay home self isolate like way paper worded notifying health department kind travel vicinity isolation. 

Since seems use standard document, notion getting changed suit needs passed lawyers everything else would kind ludicrous moments notice. sign, got prize behind Door #2. use either. google find map? Great article! like doorbell idea, pain perhaps effective. Wow straight negligence, thats crazy. hope youre negative. thank Lord Ah yes, sniffles. 

That explains hospitals getting full morgue trucks.  slow down, virus impeded higher humidity, higher temperatures increased UV exposure. flu seems nearly vanish summer months.

The part people pay attention COVID much contagious common flu, slows down, stop without human intervention.

For sake argument, let's say native (no preventive measures taken) r0 common flu 1.4 2.5 COVID. Let's also say summer weather cuts half. Huzzah, flu .7 fades away. COVID still 1.25 spreading. slower, take measures, pack bags summer own.

As mention, scary. summer lull. drop infection rate looks like summer weather. start fading. Folks need prepare. actually it. I'm changing lyrics Phish's Disease, hoping start chain.

Glad hear made it. friend dealt worst April (and survived) another friend recently diagnosed.  Omg. I’m sorry. saw another article study South Korea showing ages 10+ spread quickly adults. school doesn’t offer online option mine also out. Check homeschool groups area resources curriculum state requirements. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Oh wait air born 😂 19 million caught spitting breathing touching surfaces. Jesus Christ hope old advice free cause worth 1 cent shit CPP selling Yes will. They've already started hiring private security wearing black shirts many locations called ""health ambassadors."" Essentially putting bouncers front. Home Depot. 

I'm sure corporate memo said losing revenue gaining require masks (i.e., fewer anti-maskers stop going mask mandates people shop less lack mask wearing), mention nearly corporations want Covid end masks help this. Basically, Walmart knows best financial self interests madate masks. Teacher murdered school leadership parents add this, denying severity Covid-19 - really, even truth - are, think, comparable various ""truthers"" many ways.

Take Flat Earther orbit look porthole, they'll say movie.

Walk anti-vaxxor study study shows vaccines obvious connection autism, they'll show one study shows *might.*

The list goes on. They've completely identified personal level position, entire lives wrapped it.  Arguing argument rarely going work. wish knew would... Whoa there, expect schools ""fix"" inconvenience sick missing class? sick inconvenient. That's life. something schools fix. 

I've also never seen schools pressure sick kids suck up. get sent nurse fever symptoms sent home. suggesting schools need fix peer parent pressure sick kids? theoretically, i'm well aware. tested proven years road see problems theoretical. promising yes, totally unproven relative vaccine approaches. conservatives pushed conspiracy theory narrative young people children cannot get spead COVID19 despite literally data science saying otherwise come find pro life party pro life all. I'm anti trump you, dude. But, correct I'm wrong, Spanish Flu basically covered up, least downplayed, world spread around due morale reasons?

I'm trying excuse Trump - trying (and maybe misinformation, I'm wrong, tell I'm full shit) highlight happened much worse pandemic. Kick scream actions though - sarcasm. looks things, shit getting worse worse America, kick off, better things be.  work moved untracked sick leave. sick, let team know stay home. ""just kind sick"", feel free check things, maybe work document, etc. otherwise, hope feel better, see soon.

Productivity gone all, feels like actually gone up. Also we've WFH since March continue rest year...and successful think we're going move level permanence WFH.

I feel bad people companies. humble brag, feel legit bad, wish employers actually respected you. :( friend waiter steak restaurant. offered job back reopened said making unemployment. Note: otherwise cautious covid isn’t quarantining. family high school perfect attendance. tradition every one kids would get (there like 4-5 kids). remember one day one girls crashed totaled car way school tired couldn’t stay awake wheel. sure sick something else, *had* go school every school day, matter what. post-crash went school anyway, huge black eye. Crazy. perfect attendance big fucking deal anyway? school wasn’t even huge prize anything associated it, certificate would get. It’s possible countries get much travel US large US. effective would caught virus super early (no one know virus first started circulating here) would needed complete travel ban time. missed it’s impossible. keep hearing small countries don’t get quarter international travel New York succeeded containment. It’s thing. long illness change view?

Glad recovering, btw Remember United States required paid sick time. people come sick probably don’t want either need pay bills 

Or employer makes jump hoops. Going doctor costs $300 “note”. know I’m sick. I’m really going pay get note I’m short $ anyways. Imagine celebrating selectively passing donations. Everyone fucking need get access help people specific skin color. Gross. Apparently, defense mechanism human brain. it. combat actually means overriding natural defenses brains. it, mechanism supplies Denial phase 5 stages grief. fight it. 

Some people simply refuse to. I've never spent less hour waiting... 14 million confirmed cases. Sure, actual infections probably much higher that. we’re specifically talking confirmed cases, here. doesn’t change seems rare. you’re going get high horse science, though, use data set everyone else discussion. acknowledge can’t know prevalent reinfections among unconfirmed infections. Non-paywall story left shaking. feel badly them. course dont. :) beep boop :) Painful, lonely, gurgling death usually describe it. Here's better idea. Shut bars restaurants. They're human petri dishes. incredibly devastating loss family. one bury thirteen year old. 'It Gpa's time. wanted economy survive. Bless sacrifice.' I've telling mom! Wow, thought covid thing would get hand, thanks Google. anything believe Next they'll requiring pants shop store. stop?! Wow, wow. People amazing, good though! amazing healthcare right Take care. Small kids good spreading colds diseases spread via air, droplets touch, either buy kinds explanations.

If small kids spread COVID-19 easily, I'm inclined think immunological explanations. reason small kids typically less severe cases also reason spread much ill.  took 4 months. beer it? Corona? “Kids don’t spread this.” Except, whoops, turns teenagers spread [just adults.

The high school teach announced Friday resuming in-person classes weeks. first call made lawyer’s office update create advanced medical directive power attorney. Yes, I'm intrigued post bashing Fox news voted, comment ""there decent liberals"" voted dirt.

Reddit form peer censorship... pro CNN, pro liberal, proud Democrat comments visible that's gets voted. pro conservative ideas conversations get downvoted removed.

Also, bots help.

the thing worse two party system, single-party system that's we're headed to. 
Americans know understand monopolies bad, yet embrace political system Teacher here, people love comment rarely actually reading. like day 5th grade class again. wonder indoor dining outdoor dining. ThT really valuable know. bet carry vastly different risks. Oh knew. Wait try use stupid HRA card. documentation! Omg. I'm glad got knees done years ago. lot sick time left. soon tried use money card, much proof eligible expenses. two year nightmare large ones. dad attended one said everyone wear masks, since around 100-200 people people maintained 6 foot distances other. supposed big one town got cancelled Antifa started expressing interest.

Edit: clarify, “riots”. I’m talking couple peaceful protests. I’m confident they’re source infections. There’s force field makes impossible. wear mask, MAGA hat keeps falling off. It’s science. That’s awful US never changes? long ago women leaving kids daycare go work full-time job rare. Always changing. ...and they're still alive. least dying something interesting COVID (moose accidents).  children sneeze, cough bad basic hygiene habits. went Target Michigan yesterday every person saw mask on. first time happened.

Edit: Wait Friday, yesterday. Can’t keep days straight. Total brain fog, it’s drag. Science + politics = politics account. incapable making argument resorting username defense stupidity? Sad. Yeah look states data VA whites mostly getting dying it. said way back blacks Hispanics getting dying most. true. makes much sense. 

The thinking folks like infections rare, they’re harmless. Yeah is.

It's lockdown thing works. See, example, Spain Italy, arrest people going drive.

If want get hundreds thousands people dead, let exactly call for, let anyone go anywhere feel like.

And notice ICUs full, death rates keeping going up.

So. Yeah. want millions dead Americans, let highly infectious people go wherever want. since January 21, 2017. Sounds like county I'm close too. Start W exactly full smartest bulbs bunch? Unless cop tasing one mother's stomach okay Asshat!!! asked regrets choice wear mask, said, “I don’t really second guess anything.”

This pretty much sums entire federal governments response. Teachers get shat society general.

They go strike.  hatred minorities blinds logical thought. Coming new yorker...i dont know necessarily done right compared california. really know big curve flattener? see people everywhere, interacting, shopping, eating out, park. responsible testing contact tracing community level isolating incidents? Mask casket. goal 0 deaths 0 new cases, correct? guys find better way reach goal would hesitate say handled poorly. haha. Wait! cases deaths though. Meth Terrifying really. also incompetent thinks helping keep presidency. March April, still pretty sure would reelected. know. must lot old people voted see boob is. point? since beginning. basically hydra really is. I’m getting stressed going town groceries I’m eating local restaurants. enough small towns vote red November issues. 
I’m also worried election fraud administration’s part. keep talking it. I’m experience narcissists say you’re going something something usually means thing. Like husband accusing wife affair affair. Lol nobody gives shit baseball Canada. People give shit NFL Blue Jays, even team. 

Toronto NHL money hosting half playoffs. think give two shits Blue Jays can't play? Exactly. news uncommon. 

There's reason media focusing 100,00 COVID victims elderly plenty co-morbidities, media's focus emotionally manipulate fear healthy young middle aged population.

""See young guy died? could next!!! Oh, also, going publish entire medical history, photo even name privacy reasons, trust us, exists underlying health conditions. Pinky promise, would never lie, even last words nurse even though one independently verify it!"" nope November, really? Personally started worry prepare China stating build hospitals, like January *crickets* funny think side thinks cheat. 

Regardless good helping people tegsiter vote exercise right vote  know meme karma, actually pretty worrying turn events. got covid beat it, antibodies. wore mask public. got reinfected anyway.

These types events driving factors public health policy, instead US dismantling CDC reopening.  open fucking schools 3 weeks?! mess. administration worst. think us probably knew Trump people would bad handling major national crisis.

But bad it, borderline unbelievable. truly remarkable wrong they've done this. took average person paid 100 million dollars construct worst possible response covid, I'm sure could've come something worse we've done US far. I'm actually headed nursing right now. 

This ass, swaying personally know anybody dropped it. 

Just two cents.  Even higher yesterday. D: Nooo.... say. SAY unless provide best PPE there. pretty much got everything kitchen sink. blame one bit.  Yea would make sense    ...maybe? even know anymore ""Me-damn it, Satan. agreement. get realm, gotta take assholes."" asked clinical research facility area who's study vaccine becomes available next months, would tell already got vaccine placebo. said no. said get vaccine said yes. would study even work placebo group? says “non-n95 cone mask” n95 worn properly zero outward travel. Burner account? cowardly use real one? Won’t matter. lie. does. fragrant flower scents rainbow light emanates it. cases nursing homes come came infected staff visitors, transfers. **SHIT** we're sick pandemic &amp; POS country fucking even MORE.  bubble concept NBA. Aside 2 teams drop bubble tournament, seem fine. NWSL almost done bubble tournament Utah.

the amount people associated MLB, NFL NBA compared MLS NWSL, comparable. security contingencies alone dwarf NWSL.  


They're also played regions far less covid.  


It's comparable they're sports, that's it. 

and started testing less backed afforded better control ""their bubble"". talking first third world countries here? Cuz aside states US joke lockdown. sure first worlders worse tho. Long Island leave houses two months unless grocery shop essential worker living us. wear masks, respectful keep distant. NY gets bad rap, good people us smart don’t fuck around. I’m glad see us getting lil praise hard scary long time. several months since start outbreak. longer spaces infections gets, worrying makes me. read oxford vaccine, based mers vaccine 5 years trials behind it. already know safe. 12 days taking test results yet. FML Louisiana. Science correct Non-science dribble wrong? effing WAYYYYY. Someone got let world population know this. least......America....maybe...please Sure, says guy 0 input. least try... 38% willing risk dying fake virus OC Wonder opinion Trump’s handling January until...today beyond. start taking seriously.

Watch do, say

.. *jackshit* say ? Wow, color surprised delusional idiot. Mode RNA’s main business self promotion pumping stock price expect lots news stories nine remaining days trial begins. friend, literally CANNOT get back normal shit control. completely eradicated, least controlled. 

You're logic what's drawing whole situation needlessly. Who’s protesting. cov-idiots would protest mass gatherings pandemic. judging term limited person replaced, yes That's problem here. He's probably going fine. fuckwads always are. ""see virus. worried."" Well (Australia) positive confined home unless need go hospital - done via Ambulance free emergencies. Police come check abiding home confinement order fines steep (and jail available really want play stupid games).

But even regime ankle tag people - that's insane. Plus mortality rate low, pretty confident probably almost fatal cases people serious issues severe comorbidities. We've seen odd news story every couple weeks young healthy athlete dies whatever, that's - someone like dying thing rare national news story.

So exactly stretch see young healthy people scared. course, absolve responsibility spreading others, serious real. there's lot selfish people there, ones detecting lot non-selfish reasons freeze lives year.  Sorry rush, right corrected 😊 Cmon, parent parent...in past never gave Motrin 7am bring fever could get work least half day (Knowing course ok, nothing serious)?

I have. joke President, Administration, country point. repulsive. articles think he'd post.  level stupidity that's unbelievable. They're second worst mortality rate nation, behind NJ. kind shit people take seriously. NY killed thousands seniors putting infected people back homes. Anyone buying fucking idiot. update caused Xinjiang cluster? another state mentioned earlier today dealing issue? Oh I'm disagreeing you. mean even want make numbers public. excuse laughable "" want flexibility reallocate resources"". “President” like still power 85 cases 8407 county spread four months.  Dude cut snark. Different diseases less likely transmitted different age groups. Studies like important given conclusion. dream, right? dear leader also worlds BEST immunologist alongside forays aspects sciences arts. America tremble beg help dear leader vaccine. One friends posted Instagram stories, found childish drivel. shame you. fact, I'm saying would pleasant, merely offering fact lot people line iv hours teaching. good another thing entirely early numbers 70-80% death rate people ending ventilator, think getting better though doc's rushing put people vents like early conservative even blood oxygen low cases covid would indicate ventilator. And? None said mentioned autoimmune issues refuted claim deal said issues. Thanks! Don’t despair yet. Things bad hopeless.  Minimum wage children complete losers want advance. Everyone gets minimum wage. starting life need work minimum wage, that'w get roommate help make rent. gonna talk guy coronavirus he’s wearing mask? Yeah idk people think otherwise, thats viruses work lol. course spread it. look motorbike, heart attack, stroke, words besides pneumonia add corona search see deaths counted. Also funny enough, type number Google say, say 242 666 321 123 54, Google say related Corona. Im flattered think could look worse already do. maine?   sure seems way. I'm AZ someone know bragging Facebook yesterday getting face masks made tulle. know, material used make ballet tutus bridal veils. clever, right? honestly despair. We're one worst affected states (if worst) people acting like joke. California close taking #1 state correct management.

My point states actually stop all-out spread ones called “correct.” ones irresponsible first made corrections. coordinating absolutely nowhere near NY NJ remained way. definitely live near me. one masks. insane. unions weak united states ""right work"" laws effectively require unions give benefits non union employees company, bother paying union dues? corollary ""fire will"" laws many states long discrimination can't proven, employer get rid worker reason time (such joining union business like). 

i find strange police unions seemingly. right even teachers unions good job making states provide better protection schools/kids. steelworkers union used strong, auto workers union used be, laws stacked pretty badly many areas.  Fauci really turned partisan scumbag. vote office people want more... might sound silly bit whiskey feel like might exposed...like day opened front door without mask thinking delivery turned kid next door sister Covid, small amount whiskey afterwards. Anyway makes feel better reading article maybe silly all... Virginia also great job. Shut everything down, mandated masks, slowly opening things phases, masks still required course. shocked shocked. guy governor? wonder U.S justice system messed up. cowbell? Getting office letting kill another 100-200k Americans definition phyrric victory. good outcomes anymore, less bad ones. Yep. administration highly corporatist, whether red blue. Data massaged whatever way Wall Street satisfied. black people Mexicans dominated Wall Street they’d love black Mexican people. mean, almost exclusively poop work. Saves toilet paper gives little break go look phone.

Could one situations. hope people contagious first two weeks, even symptoms months later. roommates month finally moved back house; I'm still paranoid It’s malevolence day 1 don’t realize you’re paying attention. certainly did!!! Proud new Yorker #nytough #nystrong Got link article? Seems pretty stupid people wearing masks hotspots 

Also, places peaking hot weather wise right now. 

Too many people breathing recycled air conditioned air, like cruises. Well, honestly think one goals Church Satan. Aaay nice username  joke, Mary Trump's (his niece clinical psychologist) new book hammers hard.

Not denying someone something. also derives pleasure lying someone. even important meaningful lies. enjoys power trip lying getting away it. log numbers records.  weeks begin Saturday that's first started tracking things March 21.

So entirely possible ""my"" week different basket deaths/cases whatever source using.  Also, numbers fluctuate lot even hours... log numbers given day might impact one way another...  numbers right ballpark.  

But yeah, get stuff Bloomberg, which, last heard, gets stuff John Hopkins.

Personally live metro area want move sticks main guy started it? Wanna read I'm sure sick days really change much unless unlimited sick days company culture sick days used sick. lot companies permit employees use sickdays like vacation days becomes especially useful rarely get sick end hitting max sick days. think max sick days accumulate workplace 1-2 years worth (15ish days think). Number times I've sick past year 1 day.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlimited sick days solve this, seem rare. It’s Brawndo, fucksnorkle  never gotten phase 3 highest saturday case count ever highest saturday fatality count 7 weeks. trending exactly? sounds super good. almost never drink, man could use one those. blows mind state done almost worse *every state* held example what's good.

However, unless come way go give injections every bat pangolin jungle, COVID eradication probably table. vaccine make less widespread also less deadly, like flu shot does, would fine. states flattened curve. states’ case numbers still going up. curve truly flattened, definitely think go back, then. Exactly. Either way, neither number 1.4% site.

I’m making political statement discussing further-reaching implications anything sort. I’m simply saying statement technically correct. Idk guys keyed looking arguments none had. they've ever got. need pay people certain age away social security. It’s scam. I’d way rather put money 401k get way way better returns.

Apparently there's screenshot COVID test package reads test also registers positive *many coronaviruses*. 

So narrative bleated anti-mask crowd say 100 people city test positive today. 3 4 actually virus rest simple coronavirus brings common cold. nothing mindset whole US really politicised pandemic

This beyond *politics*. everyday workplace. Everyday life. Deaths city! politicians votes elections. breakdown society itself.

Social theories Mass Mind, Howard Bloom, Carl Jung, Marshall McLuhan, Rick Roderick - ignored denial abounds. Petrol addiction, unwillingness change, another example: Climate Change. topic *survival civilization*, politics. beyond normal integrity things ""debated"" endlessly. even reason assume ""the economy"" benefit moving away fro Petrol, deep seated self-destruction urges driving behavior variety topics. Duh modified older vaccine extensive proof completely safe. Lockdown getting wrecked. worse almost every European country. need celebrate use example. Massive reporting deaths died home. comment gave cancer complications beyond death concerned may ones get virus possibly die? Seriously, question? care neighbors anti-maskers care one themselves. Survival smartest (could combat idiocracy). Oh think trump fine job handling this? Everything need know know now. still don’t hear solutions coming would costed thousands lives. Stop arguing fucking healthcare worker actually SITUATION eeem adamant know perfect solution for. guarantee death toll would juet high mystery solution thought up. Bets exorbitantly high price tag vaccine Canada sounds nice right now. response pandemic really showed countries priorities it’s far states visit friends family. corona person wears mask relatively safe especially outdoors, least opinion. say 2 hair stylists corona styled like 140 customers wearing masks none custies ended testing positive? that's indoors CNN recently put death rate different terms. said death rate would equivalent 50 plane crashes per WEEK since April. many planes crashing every week would people pay attention then?   Wait little bit... Eventually vaccine politizised way current administration... Sad times yeah. flip side freedom guess, politician's politickin. can't weld us homes, great, acknowledge means need approach situations differently need people coordinated central action. coordinated central action not, either way problem get solved without people someone read article sum me? needed study this? thing Networks air cable 24 hour running 2 hour Covid 19 Documentary showing people dying (who give permission so) ages.

slow testing?? remember countries sending tests germany thay faster actually theirs. dad (also german) also able tested pretty easily fast results. exactly try get tested??

more cases could've had...?? everyone (almost) get point kinda unavoidable point. however hospitals even neeeeeeeear capacity also one lowest mortality rates. that's goal.

What do? 
How infected?  know what?

It’s entirely possible someone gaming algorithm. Russian Chinese coders extremely talented absolutely capability/resources “split testing” suspicious of.

But yeah it’s whole rabbit hole worth going down.

We need teach everyone algorithms. It’s insidious social media presented natural news feed reality underlying code calculating every single thing do.

Oh, hovered mouse YouTube clip 5 seconds?

Scrolling Facebook newsfeed stop look post cars 5 seconds?

Your personal emails via Gmail? Every single word analysed processed “anonymously” (which get away it).

Every single thing social media platform popular free platform data mining every single action non-action do. tried nothing, work. worldometers good comparative tool, would defer local reporting sources comes official numbers. could still die. I’m starting think might chance. That’s kindof way people. Don’t ever admit might wrong something means you’re wrong everything. That's necessarily true. descendants people fought secure freedoms much better position it.

Here, talking 1984-level authoritarian, evil, fascist rule. said can’t spread it. minimal testing without showing symptoms done children weren’t enough tests waste non symptomatic people. shown n many different places absolutely spread it. used retail manager.

So, username parodying LOTR reference or... ""Experts"" say ok said BLM protests didnt anything spike cases happened immediately  think, took 4 dark months get I've noticed great way encourage others socially distance you, along mask. Also, showering neglecting personal hygine done wonders. #*ATHLETES [French study finds kids seem pass along another another know everyone creaming finally found study goes along intellectual biases, ignoring countless studies go narrative, counter study, indeed make anti-science. Lol. I'm Christian I'm atheist agnostic best. Even actual fuck anything?

Are dense? Fyi- emergency authorization bypasses validity testing normally conducted approval, many labs run multiple concurrent tests using frequent kits ensure quality control. I'm sure happened, getting negative across multiple test types way sure. Critically ill people ICU tested negative. Additionally, tests require highly skilled technician, there's room error, especially since enough technicians meet demand. 

Unfortunately, might never know sure covid, doctors always use testing + evaluation diagnose condition. doctor calls probable covid I'd trust that.

Makes sure goes downwards.... ^/s don’t know anyone would step foot Walmart begin with, staying protected means never leaving hike reason, reddit doomers instructed. Haha, valid. decreasing number cases 25-30% could increase chances successful CT effort.  right.

The whole dick people views based reality got first place. GERD always cough full, post covid interesting restaurant. agree thought process places like AAP(The American Academy Pediatrics) stated want kids back school conflicting message. makes whole mess worse. It'd nice normal included 2m rule though.

I also kind like mask I'll using often too. 1. Ban social media pushes conspiracy theories misinformation (a poster talks this)

2. Replace current US administration voting November 

3. live area mask mandate sensitive indoor areas write local government asking it

4. someone Karen wearing mask politely ask wear one, don’t get manager. Part would want record broadcast social media try get fired like happened Costco people, might excessive. 

5. Move away whole anti-science anti-intellectualism putting emphasis education. almost need campaign this, support athletes celebrities get attention ignorance gotten bad. 

6. Stop political spin sides holding news media accountable bias reporting 

7. people truly ignorant stupid, don’t waste energy trying convince hope less ignorant kids. people entrenched ignorance social media news hyper partisan think balanced help. truly believed they'd stop looking stepping traffic mentioned something effect rural areas may poorer.

Otherwise hard see right. in: duh. offer anecdotal experience 15 years teaching. K-12 leadership keep jumping fads. Every two four years **new shiny thing** gets rolled out. teachers campus/district get forced go hours upon hours implement **new shiny thing**. told **new shiny thing** future *forever*, spend year tearing every lesson teach apart redesign meet format **new shiny thing**. examples consultancy firm brought train us entirely different grade levels subjects told can't fit lessons perfect mould something wrong you. ask show say ""you're expert content, can't you.""  **new shiny things** I've seen come go time: Bloom's levels, Kilgo, Small Learning Communities, 5e model, 3 learning types, Project Based Learning, Capturing Kids Hearts model, High Schools Work, NCAC, seven thousand different specific flavors ""differentiated instruction"". Sometimes even drop old fad entirely ask keep previous (conflicting!) model implementing new one. every new Principal Superintendent prove something. seem reinventing wheel.

So waste much time chasing dumb initiatives instead boring, practical, ""nuts bolts"" type training. Even I've gone tech-specific training 20 minutes someone running cute new app new data processing platform yet another way view state testing data (spoiler alert: usually tells already know interacting kids).

That's big question. 

My assumption antibodies fade, left t-cell response would make getting covid less severe.  

In perfect world, everyone would get vaccine, would effective enough time virus die out. reality (especially US) lot people even bother get vaccine. hope vaccine offers enough protection dramatically reduce cases eventually possibly potent vaccine, real breakthrough treatment  Yes, one poorest countries world one best health care systems.

In post, essentially worst-possible-case scenario, I'll give anecdotal evidence 2-3 people tested positive visited crowded bar one Saturday night city, within 2 days, information shared widely social media, caused dozens go get tested isolate. even bar/restaurant example, *some* suppression spread still possible.

The much bigger problem, opinion, test results taking week many areas country. Contact tracing essentially useless that's case. guess what? funding Congress could help solve issue. Trump course opposes reasons. land “me me” Yes no. Antibodies (to virus) expected decline recovery - covid, seems decline relatively fast (within months, many cases - research needed find e.g. lasts ~x months ~y% cases, ~z months n%, etc). 

The immune system also cells (to virus) produce antibodies case reinfection virus. research still needed find protective cells covid (do prevent reinfection, weaken it, etc) Vermonter here. Pretty convinced low key different country can't reveal would bad morale states found out. I've lived New England life never lived anywhere central air. one life-long dreams! course, I've also never lived anywhere dishwasher, last two apartments washer/dryer. least lifelong dreams small, they're easier someday attain... health care about, probably skip brewpub entirely. entirely possible alcohol steals years life Americans C-19. simply would ebola level dangerous would given seriousness already Yeah, hear you. Reddit, often see slogan ""Your mask meant protect people, you!"" 

And think.. man, seems counterproductive. mean, sure, minimal level motivation act ways protect others Covid. first priority going protecting myself, family, etc. That's selfish, sure, but.. human nature too. 

And us live areas there's crappy rate mask compliance, probably makes slogan even less motivating. tons people part protect me, make effort protect them? me, means I'll go ahead wear valved n95, I'm sure contributes people either refusing wear mask chin-strapping it.

Shortages.. yeah, that's issue. feel like stepping n95 production #1 priority terms pandemic response. almost hard find legit n95s sale find decent gun sold out, ha! Yes.  shit? can’t imagine walking something like trying politely get stop.

Do want get shot? going happen go around telling people put masks. No; OP wrong. report tests persons tested per day, tests per day. six tests day, they'd report 2 tests, 50%. recount people previous negatives want exclude base population.

If tested every day, tested positive day 4, it'd be: 2 tests-0%, 2-tests-0%, 2-tests 50%, 1-test 0% (1 active case). percentage ""people test positive never tested positive"". Ok, insist strongly Russian shot good. take phrase “not necessarily bad” context, emphasize it, completely ignoring next part sentence, says ""The problem evidence \[of effectiveness\] doubt"". also ignore fact doctor said ""not necessarily bad"" still recommends patients generic French vaccine, vaccine initially invented Russia. ""refute"" argument Influvac referring ""idiotic insurance system"".

So maybe provide least argument confirms Russian flu vaccine **is good** instead trying refute words bad (btw, without giving proof, although initially exactly demanded me)? Thats Calvinism is. Calvinism says God predestined everything happened ever happen. Whether person deserves get nothing done. Oatmeal rocks (; top that, insanely less international travel, too.

It kind makes wonder if, people start letting guard back worldwide year so, years' worth basically flu exposures we'll end astonishingly bad flu season in, say, 2023. That’s school district. It’s disheartening. laughed someone claimed immune response pathways easy understand. [that boi got governor north carolina announced schools set remote person schools district decide handle it. Asheville they're exactly describing person k-6th grade remote optional remote 7th-12th, think. virus acts others, belongs strain, NOVEL VIRUS meaning new HUMANS. unlike FLU VACCINES MEDICINES HELP FIGHT THOSE. ONE ANTYIHNG FIGHT THIS.  


thats virus 1918, black plague, etc.. first came humans cure nothing fight cause also NOVEL VIRUS first appearance.  


no one seems grasps NOVEL means. It’s shame time, money, resources wasted try convince people NYT source data, ones made graphs. data official data US States countries around world total deaths causes. Choose ignore truth want, unless world governments straight reporting deaths never happened, virus killing excessive amount people compared flu. spike Boston protests cause, mr bostonac? Cuba also sent doctors world help bad. Masks still reasonable defense virus. Masks best used protect others virus, everyone needs wear one.

Here current article:  Oh I’m sorry didn’t realize needed link everything lazy ass Oh see (I misunderstood meant “stop), context won’t stop sites either sites peddling shit still exist, they’re monetizing effectively.  Personally virologist works engineering proteins, money expedite fuck science. 

You simply need coordinate teams hire plans. Accelerating molecules new biotech money absolutely that. 

That said, boy don’t trust novavax’s stock price one fuckin second cynical side says no. But, I'm absolutely certain form airborne herpes, anti-maskers would wearing five time, refusing go outdoors. I'm right you. want go movies go eat friends - want COVID tho so... Went Walmart saw 99% mask compliance. Thank mayor mandate governor president bother. Thanks link. interesting. take via current observation. Curious know there's scientific reasoning younger kids susceptible, purely chance due right situation. Hopefully good sign re-opening school later year. 

This article alarm day: It’s almost like virus doesn’t care age. people think virus kind age bias it’ll effect? (wearing mask) reduces susceptibility 30%.

If person Covid wears mask not, reduces chances 95%.

If wear mask, around 98.5% effective.

(Edit: originally heard information progressive podcast information shared hospitals. collective crowd sourcing, numbers controversial read replies, opportunity look different sources information absorb yourselves.

In end, what's important statistic involving mask use valuable resource fight transmission rates, especially US. Coupled social distancing, refraining indoors public spaces, limiting exposure avoiding large gatherings even amongst friends family; ability individuals make change regain control situation dealing world.)

(Edit 2: List sources additional efficacy everyone shared information)   ok, reddit also seems exclusively think antivaxx also 'dumb, rural conservative' thing started affluent populations California seeking 'organic-type' lifestyle. people foreign country, ignorant Americans would simply write hoax aren’t affected by.

Sadly, this. 
Either that, they'll say, ""That's they're using American medicine"".

Another good example fate Conestoga town Lancaster, PA 1763 (no, it’s wagon). Paxton Boys, vigilante group organized French Indian war, made claims indian attacks, blamed Conestoga (who peacefully living nice land awhile) helping nebulous enemies, burned Conestoga town night killed six people (fortunately due weather number people away home night).

A reward put Paxton boys, many locals sympathetic one sold out. Sixteen survivors kept protective custody barn Lancaster City.

Sadly doesn’t end there. night Paxton Boys broke in, murdered (some scalping dismemberment) two (including eight children). Members Paxton boys never prosecuted, went participate massacres following decades. Conestoga people longer exist. reinfection previously mild SARS-CoV-2 cases realistic possibility considered models second wave post-pandemic era several years SARS-CoV-2 could develop endemic seasonal CoV similar transition 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus seasonal influenza virus. couple days row missed deadline reporting, also Mondays historically low reports point out. hope tardiness suppression purpose narrative ahead dept ed meetings taking place early week. America explain! confusion!! No. adding negative tests positive ones. see new PCR tests day Dashboard. state report play funny numbers. Go back Facebook. 12,500 cases sunday? Florida must trollin Duh, people grade school people now? That's fair, well!

Like Cuomo, Dewine, Whitmer, Hogan done well general this. Fantastic leadership transparency around. even 50/50 split dems republicans too. 

I think ultimately problem south is, well, they've antiscience anti-authority far long nip shit bud early enough end what's happening something simple ""wear mask help fellow american"" becomes political statement ""better dead democrat"" idiots. Yeah, true. see footage refrigerator trucks NY. Im body lifter/ power lifter. Mere body weight access gym isnt enough im talking getting fit im already that. response exactly id expect random redditor. Clueless data exist. course can't. see anyone say confidence long-term immunity real data collected many years. immunity lasts 18 months? Two years? can't know yet. true confirmation bias lies expecting can't get re-infected...that's much attractive popular belief. possible know yet.

Just look ppl working grocery stores too. They're getting paid lot they're dealing this. Edit: Study

Lol theres chance aliens came down, abducted me, gave super powers, brought back. doesnt mean true though donate donate others also need? gross. took atudy figure out? Well, unless money speed time make months vaccine testing equivalent years decades, there's still problem safety.

The point Warp Speed fund development multiple vaccine candidates, whereas past, would ever receive funding. still negate real possibility ineffective (or, worse, botched) rushed vaccine.

What's alternative? vaccine development, none think time constraints.

But handling pandemic, federal mandate mask wearing actual enforcement would go long way. Thank you!!  really hope isnt happening, cant ignore fact basically every story person potentially getting reinfected involved hospitalized second infection. 

That said, could also true lots people reinfected problems dont hear cases. Lets hope so! didn’t contact trace kids didn’t symptoms, there’s bit gap knowledge.

And far, probably best study/information virus far. still many unknowns virus. also, everyone ignoring findingthat kids 10 may half likely spread it, could implications reopening younger kids, generally need care supervision working parents. death rate 0.5%, even misery, suffering, tragedies we've far many deaths we're 8% way thing. Thanks, Trump! wait till find everyone spread effectively adults. It’s workers lesson learn - it’s workplaces don’t offer paid sick leave work culture penalizes staying home kid sick. religious family local church extremely diligent self isolation PPE measures. Cooking delivering food elderly community don’t go grocery stores exposed.

My non religious neighbors across street house parties every weekend. kidding guests cars parked street including parking spot.

It’s religion it’s selfish idiot responsible member society.

How people engage religion, much like engage civic duty wildly variable. Humanity general isn’t healthy. little actually helps planet. good deeds offset tremendous destruction. biggest thing probably help earth die get buried, provides nutrients soil...but cremation rise cheaper product, capitalism wins destroying planet, even death still takes 6 minutes UV light sun kill virus.  

**BULL** shit.  KiDs rEturN SchoOL Even pandemic even Missouri giving free weed blow, would still rather punch dick week spend one day Missouri. Man fuck America 🤦‍♂️  remember months ago early China didn’t report kids virus, reported kids it. suspected least theorized/wondered whether kids didn’t get affected weren’t spreading it. we’ve since seen countries isn’t true kids getting infected spreading idk headlines like seem revolutionary point. Yeah, unfortunately abusers ruin everyone. everyone could call much wanted penalty would cause issues own. shitty. No, also love people hate government!!

How feel Putin? friend grew Moscow considers despotic madman looted incalculable amount wealth opportunity Russian people. Thoughts? Where's evidence this? guy incompetent, conspiracy theories helping anything here. Ive worked security stores younger. pretty much SOP issues first try talk deesacalate doesnt work, ask leave. refuse, call cops let know calling cops. trespassing point. leave without pickup phone. Unfortunately, part blame rests media’s shoulders, they’ve supplemented stories stock photos used photos emergency rooms, sometimes indication picture you’re looking isn’t place article. 

I don’t think many people accustomed fact-checking ‘reputable’ news sources still believe journalistic integrity. 

When truth exposed seeds doubt sown. people saying pictures fake masks don’t work. Damn, got me! OK mate. studies indicate children 12 may rarely spread virus adults much less likely, ages, exact reasons still unclear people think can't?

It's people thinking can't. scientists clear association age transmission risk, study/article providing information want return “centrism”  feel like opposite, information helps anxiety dictatorship proletariat baller 😎. Texan here: happy admittedly jealous Vermont! consider shutting borders states refuse try control outbreak. Mate. lived 4 years. communist country. Like said before, long term goal enact it, happen.

They teach studies marx high school. again, joining government society now, whole point said. communist not? interest educating capitalists you’re comrade feel free DM get deep theory.

Of course I'm communist. work. Chinese people communist. like idea accruing wealth, rich, owning business. Maybe put first year poli-sci reading material look real world.   I’m talking AIDS deniers. I’m talking misinformation middle epidemic, including parallel getting people wear protective equipment (condoms/masks).

We models deal this. article example this. idea people far gone they’re beyond hope absurd Science Fiction. They’re pod people. That’s New Jersey. Nice tactic...

Smear someone baseless accusation discredit person. fact copied question across many comments makes strategy obvious. asking question. posting seen. Gotcha. even still, wild gyrations. awful think short years ago country put man moon. End empire sad distressing. Definitely likely, I'm trying stay little hopeful! guys best generation, understanding difficult situations willing go flow. Take care peers, y'all ok come quite story tell! Yes..... send bodies Texas.... great plan ?????? need study that? Paging Texas Senator Cronyn  government-imposed rules non-factor. Even forget UFC run literally 500 shows 20 years government oversight well-oiled machine point, UFC basically runs NSAC, report detailing actually came yesterday. Government oversight concern them, serve rubber stamp point - UFC set huge PPV events days notice government oversight, like they're waiting hear back bureaucrat paperwork like me. 

And say point moot comes Yas Island UAE. simple. theory behind people thinking can’t kids less likely develop symptoms produce heavy coughing. Since they’re coughing much they’re spreading much. There’s NY Times ‘The Daily’ podcast describes theory better.  Can't wait read findings tomorrow. Sounds like might promising results. Kap lost job bring attention things people finally starting care today.

If think weird wants donate money people suffered ways lost career bring light never understand mind Kap. cares people. think that's racist fine.

I think racist man lose career bigger patriot disavowed, hated, screamed him. US centric I’m US we’re terribly. countries surprisingly well, even Chinas economy growing right now.

There's certainly malicious management, expect countries well long term. constant local epidemics popping whenever governments relax. relax, fatigue limits budgets. need global coordination shut pandemic down, also need vaccines, otherwise we're going take turns it. There's herd immunity sight even immunity surviving partially lost (antibodies), meaning reinfections, meaning like seasonal yearly/biennially never found target sars

it went away fast, coronaviruses

if mean Cold ones, well they're responsible 20-30% colds seems they're attenuated, means there's little interest produce associated increased mortality. 

not sure one also comes logistics immunizing 7 billion people every three months. 

Yep. Well, vaccine effective, need everyone, something like 60-80%, around 5 billion. hope manage make vaccine us doesn’t money masks, vaccine made lead war global instability countries fight it. 

There still international solidarity. also interest everyone everyone get vaccine; live global economy now. means matter ""open up"" economy everyone else trouble. I'm sure country economically self-sufficient, certainly developed big country. line people need change behavior stop waiting vaccine may never come.

That accurate, yes. likely vaccine come slowly. 

Don't think I'm optimistic. I'm not. is, many substances found affecting virus  deviating discussion. Obviously he's responsible, done racist actions, supporters relevant. relevant fact shows trend encouraging racism.

What find funny Americans everything left right issue. people go back pointing good bad regardless it? Trump bad thing, try deflect ""the left"", rather acknowledge move on. converting teacher cannon fodder &amp; acting ""canary coal mine"". Seriously. BREAKING NEWS “the tongue important speaking” hope remain safe well. Wishing peace strength.

I'm exhausted too. hardly comparable, know, wonder people London, UK, USA coped World War II. keep meaning look stories people lived see keep going, try get perspective.

(again, anyone reading comment, ***not*** comparing current plight ww2! know completely different!) Sure protesters matter hope jsut angry asshole non-mask wearing deniers still fighting keep bars open avoiding illegal gathering orders "" RIGHTS ""  


Social Justice Misunderstood value American Rights Huge factors virus spread right along many many ways government failed us. website here, see lot amateur-virologists immunologists blaring falsehoods misinformation matter. try get primary sources usually one argue point push agenda like many like do. tell Boston, live Philadelphia. Sorry. You’re high think coronavirus go away. flu go away vaccines?  Talk beating dead horse Boom! Hook vending machines voting machines dispense Trump vote, probably. 👍 know isn’t American vaccine, right? Britain get first. following logic, Arizona, Texas, Florida's governors blame? Many local leaders opened early, ignored CDC guidelines, refuse mandate masks, still pushing schools reopened backdrop record cases. counties issued mandates, local sheriff's refused enforce law. 

Yes, federal government blame much since lack coordinated effort, claim local leaders blame completely unfounded.

Newsom power stand ground. didn't. mask exemption

Sortoff. People still claim disability can't wear mask, businesses make reasonable accommodations. course, letting inside risking lives staff customers reasonable, business would things like offer curb side pickup. 


Which perfectly fine people actually disability (they're pretty darn rare), problem ADA can't question claim, there's requirement prove it, nothing. So, example, ADA protect (I disability worth mentioning), go store request curb side service, that's technically illegal, there's fuck store call bullshit claim. civilized area, amount abuse likely insignificant, worth making lives disabled harder catch bad apples. place like article covers, whole story. People abuse left right. Businesses mercy abusers. still kick out, they'll still take white gloves deal them.  


That, IMO, bullshit. nothing tyrannical trying simple things save lives. epitome American stupidity. Calvin’s Doctrine Predestination/Predetermination specifically live eternally Heaven, versus make there. Calvin called predestined God Heaven “The Elect,” God “elected” eternal life even born. one knew part Elect not, naturally, human nature is, Calvinists started trying hedge bets (even though Doctrine doesn’t allow influence). disciplined “pure” life one lived, Hope you’d somehow increase odds getting Heaven (even though, stated earlier, Doctrine provide allow influence after-the-fact). four kids 10-17 going back middle-high school. Two kids spectrum three working real AD/HD diagnosis. Two perfectly fine online schooling last year, excelling classes needing prompting class homework.

The two big problems. 14 year old AD/HD typically well tests, suffered staying task handling self guided projects multi-part homework assignments. went nearly straight A's C's, even us checking multiple times day. difficulty online classwork tools well. 12 year old, IEP subject matter issues, AD/HD, spectrum also disgraphia major problems across board. Even meds, near constant intervention one us, extra educational aids us, struggled every aspect every step process. Neither us SPED trained. straight A's across board adapted well structure focus class rooms combined teachers talented building trust him. managed get year, took wife able home every day due temporarily furloughed. 

That's option us fall. work, work. two absolutely fail school year home unattended. Since traveling SPED teacher, provisions SPED specific online education, home option. two going school, leaves oldest youngest home together. get along, trust 17 year old watch 10 year old, going too. leaves oldest. problem there? chooses online only, automatically excluded extra curricular activities, including NHS, Key Club, clubs (even could done online), he's excluded dual enrollment early college program. So, he's choosing go well. one kid school really help anyone. exposure risk essentially same. And, him, wearing mask problem, he's fine wearing day long. Employees stand entrance/exit say hello, keep baskets straight, watch one walks cartful unpaid groceries, etc. Usually older retired person. really counted Florida’s numbers? source this? thousands people NBA/MLB bubble testing positive everyday counting toward Florida’s total would huge deal...   had* big thing enough people immunity, even though doesnt last long, virus go away cannot find new host. Best case scenario bullshit. Stuff ""back normal"". think people say ""nurses"" mean anyone works patients doctor, literally holders nursing qualifications. Good luck getting though closed borders Australia area USA far fewer people it. takes succeed. can't wait overtime end lol 500 hours already year. work chemical plant makes soaps disinfectants swamped year. like money but, getting burnt out. Oh, absolutely will! Going drug store tomorrow get something ticket!  Common misconception. Europe wearing masks.  died hero ❤ country obviously arent praying away hard enough. (/s)  Doesn’t coronavirus attack cells something like though? annoys people downvote don’t explain why, I’ll share thoughts comment. Schools aren’t suggesting closing altogether, instead going virtual school day ranging 1-5 days per week depending school district. they’re like ours, schools could move grades (especially younger) in-class instruction mid-semester area decline cases. teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, school social workers would still working full-time, usual handle unique circumstances challenges teaching taking care students they’re home. Also, someone pay keep lights actual school building. !remindme 1 day guys polos hats look plainclothes me.   would award comment I'm broke AF thanks lockdowns idea downvoted.

It’s less year, enough people get vaccine 50% make huge difference. refine time goes on, living like another 2-3 years work way higher immunity rate option. way things looking US, need vaccinate teachers first.

Sadly, endemic virtually *all* industries fields works, especially positions policy. Creating pilot programmes specific locales one thing (and rolling sufficiently successful), forcing unproven theoretic programmes entire workforce another. Fingers crossed vaccine, Moderna one, work well. Dare even hope work well - going need billions vaccines around world want hope halting virus.

* Fluency French helps. 
* easiest way get large amount ""points"" get job Canada bring unique in-demand skill set. I'm sure many options, springs mind typical example high-level tech industry positions. 
* required prove cover initial moving settling-down expenses. number quoted website roughly $22,000 cash - least, that's amount they're guaranteed wave through. 
* Another way attend grad school Canada - pretty sure that, again, required pay full tuition costs. may scholarship options truly spectacular student. 
* Finally, think family already Canada counts something. much (historically) US. 

You'll want confirm website, that's gist it. 

I'd like point could take, possibly, years years planning saving achieve. easy escape. *especially* right now, Canada *not* want Americans traveling across borders. fact... *no* country does. likely last *significant* amount time.
