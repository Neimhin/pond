0,2020-12-11," covid running China Italy, FDA spent energy suing companies make flavored vaping products. They've day late dollar short almost year. widespread US, track trace effective anymore. I'm even sure they'll far ahead. Hard predict point. easier time getting hold vaccines much larger population issues healthcare provision public attitudes. use 70% alcohol wipes. DAMN NEAR EVERYTHING home work. No. mud slinging. made mistake. costly mistake accurately criticized it. previous comment explains exactly mistake. like Trump. trying defend actions literally cannot explain actions good way can't refuted. insulting others last resort. one vindictive towards Trump situation. accurate deserved criticism.  current government want case would done right away. 

It’s crazy let economy still plummet people go hungry avoid socialistic society percent workers months. realize vaccine prevent getting virus system spreading usual right ?  prevents getting sick it. know pretty much every single cause death ""comprimised mostly elderly people"", right saying 'we'? spokesperson Pfizer, then? research claims last night. FDA report states expected amount total sample size. also states one confirmed cured. also states cases occured 9, 37, 48 days vaccination. also states confirmed correlation. Workload less less people sick Covid though. It’s gonna take long times. Maybe year two enough vaccinated. Definitely need less cases deaths! Damn, first person I've seem legit fell ""deadliest days American history"" meme.

Look again. See anything wrong think everyone died 9/11/2001 victim terror attacks? 200k long ago. titles specify 'in Us'? exclusively American sub?  guys need get fucking life stop 24/7 covid news cycle No. doesn't. Again, that's science works.

Read comments above. simplified much can. ""We"" wearing masks society right now, midst threat darkest days pandemic. I'm talking people do, cultures; I'm talking likely happen western democracies, US, might still qualify western democracy definition stretched little. they're wearing masks now--and I'm talking crazy oppositional personality disorder convenience store Texas; I'm citing major political figures going parties Washington DC, people certain New York neighborhoods, anybody Dakotas----they're going wearing masks next summer, incidence naturally dropped drastically, vaccine widely available months. going happen. people want happen may die barricade, battle win, hurt next pandemic comes around, like not.

Me, I'm happy wear mask time, on, without vaccine COVID, never ever want give receive respiratory virus again. excuse keep coughing 2-year-olds' spew good enough.

After watching contagious effects restaurant hygiene, I'll probably never eat restaurant again, either. that's germaphobia you.

Edit: way, strange asked read article, original post contains quotation it. 9/11 considered turning point American history. previous decade two, felt impervious global power. Communism fallen. end history. terrorists got wanted day, provoke USA overreact. spent trillions dollars destroyed countless lives trying return feelings safety previously had. public allowed for, even encouraged massive expansion surveillance state day serves primarily undermine rights, gottam scared brown terrorists. much cultural disagreements boil ""are Muslim terrorists destroying nation???"" - - much like red scare McCarthyism last century. people claim superpatriots ""the real America"", willing sell civic rights name safety couple thousand deaths completely simple easy things protect number, more, dying every single day months end,.... That's something. Even science education doesn’t help. another thread there’s nurse touting “advanced medical degrees” insisting won’t vaccinated wants get pregnant...eventually? It’s insane. claims work nursing home thinks it’s fine PPE use flawless. She’s completely disregarded science (that presumably understand) delusions rushed vaccine sound better head? Wtf?

I’m nurse. might stupid one since studied nursing science “advanced medicine”. She’s kind nightmare kicked journey home health. Working alone much nicer working kind personality. It’s exhausting it’s like they’re stupid purpose.

She’ll definitely administrator someday isn’t already. course go rich white communities first. could almost understand foot-dragging cases deaths soaring right now. Risk always relative. Driving 100mph dangerous compared sitting sofa safe compared trying climb K2. vaccines answer horizon, whatever risks entail. they've circulation months tens thousands people. deaths hospitalizations vaccines phase 3 trials. Enough enough. Pull thumb ass issue approval. expect replaced someone will. Didn’t lock grace etc? didn’t bug mistake seems read them. saying rushed vaccines bad. said nothing vaccines bad, rushed good bad. Nothing suggests vaccines bad effective. RemindMe! 5 months No. I’m position high exposure risk, medical issues put higher risk category. Bro logic 6k plus deaths saved makes sense moment vaccine approved enough vaccinate 60%+ country day 1. Seeing 20 million doses available far number everyone pissed California staying locked year...this why!!!!! Let know best times, weddings fucking boring. Right they’re boring dangerous. Right, like Germany. man. Glad hear others too. Wait, school denied existence dinosaurs?! grew Catholic Church/school never saw this. master statistician are. Gotta try really financially astute, say anyone else giving financial advice says way certain people want hear?

He's fucking charlatan. ""advice"" pay books seminars, rants people stop paying frivolous things organize debts interest rate.

You could get advice *free* plenty sources, including reddit. Fuck guy. Finding paper towels also hard found stupid money Data efficacy asymptomatic infection transmission still limited needs page 47-48 want stop working ease universal basic wage eliminate small business push socialism. don’t personally believe exactly sound flipped side politics. Everyone conspiracy theorist Isn’t vaccine experimental RNA vaccine?which brand new method vaccine? ask remember reading somewhere concern idea something don’t know long term effects may have? I’m open anyone clearing said wether right wrong. Good. We're rural area state wide mask order suffering businesses. Today's experience visiting 5 businesses (our every two weeks grocery trip, post office run, etc.)

3 businesses limited compliance one business employees customer wrong masks including mask employee sneezing wife's stuff trying escape. like fuck, think quarantine. 

Obviously, we're done businesses. We'll making point chamber commerce Monday. want hear businesses tell they're suffering can't bothered basic compliance. badly want shop local give business. like mask use, business' lack compliance affects **all** town's businesses. Maybe waiting rooms patient rooms, ORs critical areas certainly cleaned. know talking about. machines disinfect either UV light another peroxide fog sorts.

If real issue compromised patients getting sorts infectionst. tracked good hospitals see happen.

Only moron thinks hospital needs entirely sterile like operating room. Certainly waiting room ED gross would anticipate disinfected consistently patients? 

Different areas cleaned different standards real issue, know. Hospitals fine job. use common sense.  asking people! ideas useful common sense - certainly nothing high school educated person figure themself. stuff wildly impractical majority people. reason avoid possessing credit card, level self control all, LOT things pain ass without one. He's basically another con man dressed christian really intent fleecing flock Bullshit.

My local Kroger Walmart daily. far! many died causes mono junior year college. obituary, hopefully won’t written another 70+ years, please make sure says mono junior year college. want everyone know. wife COVID. We’re pretty sure she’s infected she’s server work home. started getting symptoms Monday Tuesday. wife social distancing home? chance make person’s symptoms worse they’re constantly exposed person shedding virus?  And?

Deaths continue rise almost everywhere. Telling truth would worked, saying would 100% cause run masks. People selfish. Buckle things aren’t changing. it. Pfizer vaccine scrutinized chemical history human civilization. odds Canada UK fucked basically zero. Gonna pass US military deaths ww2 pretty soon (416,000). war lasted 4 years.  One hope realize rest whole world that's wrong. GDP per capita, less poster referring to, also alluding fact vast majority population reap wealth. week ago unable keep meeting home felt sick weak. later told trouble breathing unable show work new project last Sunday, Ms. Cowan said.

:((  ""Prideful""? like arrogant reckless. I’m glad hear came back home. hope continues feel better It’s safe imagine contract—especially one written “great negotiator, greatest negotiator” there’d remedy vaccine didn’t work.  expecting much personal responsibility     asshole caring “stolen election” American lives. Imagine cared people much cared election different would be... fuck vastly prefer using 70% alcohol spray disinfecting. much economical materially efficient ignore weekend numbers. They're calendar artifact fewer tests reports relevant authorities.

The best comparisons week week Tue/Wed/Thur/Fri, week week, look 7 day moving average. Go Worldmeters webpage USA daily dead graph, click ""7 day moving average"". project already April peak going get better soon unless America changes tune stays home Christmas New Years Eve. Good luck that. definitely common 50's 60's, too. agree, basically western, post-industrial kind thing track record raising well-adjusted humans. clear political pressure FDA approve Pfizer vaccine. bet Congress also considering sort protection pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer lawsuits something go wrong. Shockingly enough, ignorant people medical degrees like one license revoked attending anti-masker rallies telling people wear masks 2 Titanics day keeps good luck away! Oh know, could something fact every epidemiologist world (except Sweden) predicted winter surge? Imagine dying chlorine washed tasteless industrial turkey. anyone take opinion layperson seriously? one problems, think make facebook reddit comment opinion layperson considered alongside opinions experts. qualified drag bags hotel room, decide whether vaccine safe not. thought great thing looked thread. vaccine coming, behavior reprehensible. Yea, that’s is, be. Due pretty abject failure federal government—the trump administration.

Also, news flash: countries Europe states too; call provinces. need vaccinate 40% big impact problem psuedo-promise made regarding vaccine availability would turn corner end year, reality likely months minimum receive full vaccine protection, people getting antsy shifting goalposts. 

It like Senioritis, except letting guard means tens thousands unneeded deaths. holidays cannot treated like Senior Skip Day, close yet. real dude 74m seriously don’t understand. Fuck selfish fucks. know, like years last year stock company price double. think worst managed department company. Rest may bad. thought talent. Humans easily replaced. Many love company would job half salary... company like use name get employees. probably jump 5 years forward career job (I even 1 year experience started). can't say wrong decision work many people say same. Endure years get dream job. current company hire week interviews give idea willing hire 1.5 years experience. field, known good used old algorithms. closing shit down?  I’m sure you’re downvoted, take situation absolutely correct.  utterly naive statement. j Jenius? 2 weeks read, time took create vaccine 48 hours.

It’s 4 weeks since documents submitted FDA still waiting official approval.

Just food thought..  Why, you’re clever person. realized covid pandemic doesn’t exist. Congratulations solved problem. hell? No.

It’s “3 6 months” “easy” mask wearing social distancing. point it’ll entire fucking year total. I’m sick minimization awfulness covid restrictions, especially sub, frankly terrible mental health. Fuck sub You’re wrong. 

That article also nothing backs point. relevant sources:

[Pfizer vaccine found 90+% effective preventing vaccine 94.5% vaccine 90% effective half dose followed two weeks later full  since seems like people freaking trying get it. Lotta places chicago still indoor dining, beefed security keep passerbys getting nosy like 35k flu deaths last year. We’re 293k covid deaths. would say that’s qualitatively different.

Quite specifically, talking quantitative difference. 

That said, problem death count US anyone died positive COVID, listed COVID death. 

What look common, everyday killers (heart disease, cancer, lung diseases, kidney failure etc.) see they've gone up, stayed same, gone pandemic.

There's good reason see go considering calamitous disruption COVID caused health care, least stayed same. However they've gone down, that's sure sign misattributed COVID.

I believe find they've gone significantly. love piece shit wrote book conquering pandemic absolutely butchering second wave Wut iz 1+1 messaging 2 months [**2021-02-15 00:00:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-02-15%2000:00:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide ordered 100 million doses (50 mil people) front months ago, basically delivered fast Pfizer/Biontech get made vaccine approved. countries placed orders. trials looked good wanted - there’s orders line front us.

That lag may improve Moderna Oxford approved fast, also dibs number doses those. manufacture quickly. Sounds like American thing happen Hawaii :-/ even hear right now. beyond embarrassing. whole scientific medical establishment agree rushed vaccines bad. say rushed vaccine=untested vaccine. Untested vaccine=not proven safe effective. proven safe effective=potentially dangerous vaccine. reasons vaccines generally take YEARS develop. reasons RUSHED vaccines ptentially dangerous.


 cant honestly believe created vaccine way back january february you. science works😒. anyways statement alone genuinely believe vaccine january tells clue talking about. 

And usual assuming thay read cnn article gave you. 

Like saying goes lead horse bucket water cant make drink it. That's good! Yeah yw. grandparents tried got Covid days ago thought I'd share. Scorpion RemindMe! Feb 15 would first dose admin'd? tomorrow? weird fucking question, testing more?  Tip penis injections incoming meaningful amount vaccine makes people. exactly, people need accurate generations, every old person part group Sadly due conditioned principle ""too much one thing bad"". hey, that’s kind inevitable considering you’ll never see rest us staying home day, ones  orgy pile? also ominous feeling lag reported deaths burdened systems. I'm sort surprised we're seeing infected numbers bouncing yet. may lose track what's actually going soon. can’t wait incoming country songs. Three fine. Six? Zero chance. sounds insane doubt paper spread much covid. holy shit though people insane miss working general public! Well problem? like pubs. people hysterical stay closed indefinitely.

If afraid, attend Thanksgiving celebration visit pub. clear safe. Others not, safe. business tho. tl;dr 

she clue. Hes going lucky guy. cant even get dates meet halfway 😪 understood reference two vaccines even effective Pfizer one? Space Race yet. hate it, right. got witness destructive power tsunamis Japan's 9.0. way US cases hit peak, come bit, go even greater heights destruction...yeah, fuckin' spot-on. ""Mostly"" quite few? American patriotism lip service. takes zero effort put Army bumper sticker. ask people actually sacrifice bit countrylike wear mask public refuse think concerned showing much interest Pfizer-BioNTech actual results came back could crowding-out effect reduce motivation two pairs. I’m saying that’s good reason, that’s I’ve read. SNFs, long term care facility residents staff get first, inpatient staff, outpatient Harumph. Overpaid, oversexed, here. Wealth needs punished. ashamed themselves. assume every positive case gets tested. lot people didnt get tested.

you might get point herd immunity soon, maybe sooner legit vaccine. don’t follow rules knowingly put risk, it’s fate willing accept. enough people die dumb fucking country learn severity pandemic. we, developed fucking nation earth, worst outbreak? assholes like ones described. Oh, red necks, covid deniers, anti maskers, anti vaxxers, majority trump lovers, etc etc Average stay nursing home supposedly 835 days according google. idea you’re seeing 6 months, unless that’s acute care post-fall something.

I guess also depends if/when become widow/widower move nursing home. Perhaps, even harder! :D stunning achievement. Thank scientists! Donald Trump blame. guilty 300,000 cases second-degree murder. 

A coalition nations created pursuit ensuring justice done perpetrators 9/11. Trillions dollars went exacting revenge fewer deaths America suffer every single day next 2 months. 

Too bad Donald Trump's skin brown. would executed high treason 6 months ago. approval vaccine huge. enormous relief. Front line medical staff nursing home residents staff vaccinated next weeks, already reduce hospitalization death rate 6 weeks +. roll rest us. want know quickly get it!  Hopefully good percentage incumbent lifetime politicians Link article broken- anyone link it?  Training people safely doff full PPE extremely challenging. Flying people back infected countries might much risk ICU ward PPE worn appropriate means diapers might pragmatic choice, Wuhan first wave.

We've seen numerous countries get reintroductions via flight crew quarantine returned travellers degree vigilance warranted. reintroduction potentially costly affair. that's silly. Heart disease/cancer average around 1,650 deaths every year, every day. think given day ever spikes 3,000? really fair use 2,400 (7 day average) less reported weekend week get backlog.

But already moved goalposts anyway.  Trump ""I take responsibility."" Pretty much sums up... Pretty sure people want ""oPeN evEReThINg NOw!!"" even acknowledge virus exists, they're willing anything like wearing mask get injected microchip supposed stop ""mythical"" disease. high risk activity long safe

Definitely ""high risk"" others wearing masks social distancing. course, risk becomes higher longer stay inside half hour fine. probably thanksgiving election, I’m surprised India didn’t go significantly Diwali.. waves, arms getting damn tired Yessirski ! LA doesn’t care COVID. First mass vaccine transport US Belgium 11/29. It’s here, stored several places.

But apparently it’s allowed actual vaccine administration sites FDA licenses/approves vaccine. Oversight control safety measure vaccines think? Thank you. I'm already sending love. Someday, able mourn collectively, together. future farmers America cannot thanked enough grand feat. thats people generally need solve issues own. still mindset, cant blame really, powerless force. Right you!! postpone wedding next May. Lost grandmothers recently, fiancé’s grandfather hospice. Sucks never saw us get married, grandmother mom’s side looking forward years, it’s talked about. 

Certainly never taking loved ones, hugs, moments granted. Can’t wait nightmare over! Speaking American left house months except unavoidable lots precautions, would fucking nice feel like one (or least vast minority). really doubt good couple million take it. People skeptical chinese products ends political spectrum. 

A normal vaccine made western country would give coronavirus, chinese company killed virus making vaccine, they’re injecting coronavirus someone’s body. Oh agree. find interesting would praise administration condemn issues.  That’s really good point! Also nonzero number elderly people help next generation childcare. 

The world going different side this. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m excited day coming won’t check sub, again. know money, right? Golden cage sucks enormously. 

Had come told give money usually make without work exchange locked home, would refuse immediately. That's worth it. vaccine little people already issues it, I’ll wait get vaccine due hopefully working issues. also want know long vaccine last get (I don’t like shots) flu vaccine needs renewed yearly. also afraid infertility thing (I know it’s proven false) still puts little bit doubt me. I’ll probably wait little see happens vaccine. yayay refuse kink shame. hope get ass shot ASAP! think time anti vaxxers start wear hats crafted tinfoil. least easily identify avoid them, meanwhile, protect 5G nanochip activation signals turn sheeple. win win situation round. People going accept Lockdowns business closures April, year. We'll get creative people going it. They’re actually far base, won’t necessarily get COVID it’s still possible. example, moderna vaccine showed roughly 95% efficacy preventing 100% patients getting severe symptoms otherwise contract virus. still get COVID vaccinated, you’re less likely severe symptoms.

The holds true flu vaccine others, even contract virus likely less dangerous hadn’t vaccinated all. YES, yes, want Sociopathic Greedy AF Corporate Covid Immunity. they'll spin loss many worker protections there. 

GOP *disgraceful embarrassing. sleep night? people make country happen. ashamed yourselves.* Yep &amp; GOP lawmakers sure pushing grannies &amp; nurses way, sure. rejection probably due wanting favor one pairs two.

Who cares this? feel like want many shots possible want anymore. sucks. Please explain. phrase gotten literal want canceled.  course head FDA told he’d fired wasn’t approved today. I’m sure wasn’t factor all. Public health policy based optimal outcome presupposes potential harm calculable way performance risk management. Risk management requires opportunities outsize loss addressed long becomes actuality. White House chief staff, Mark Meadows, told F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, consider looking next job didn’t get emergency approval done Friday,

Umm little concerned part Statistically, extreme majority people get “lucky”. It’s shame shouldn’t matter % people aren’t lucky, everyone taking seriously regardless. Lmao youre fucking stupid There’s known cure bells palsy. deforms face effects nerves face. Cases range mild sever. Earth earth Earth. Everybody get porch wait newly-trained postal worker come administer shots!  could care less anti vaxers get corona take mine. That’s great thing 95% success rate vaccine.  lets carpet bomb alberta recolonize less stupid stock. same. county/state doctors believe virus go away since election over.....they still say that. doctors nurses push beliefs treatment we're doomed. end easily 2028 numbers people masks/vaccines compared number people like masks cautious vs number ready go get vaccine tomorrow. Even Covid year, world surplus 83 million births instead 84.5 million even 9 hrs ago [white house chief staff threatened FDAs chief's approve vaccine end today. coincidence. guys paying attention. 3 million vaccines can't get till June. 

We seeing normal till Xmas next year earliest. ideas values 135 years old. article May. Back May serious concern COVID was, large part, transmitted surfaces. know vast majority transmission via respiration. 

The amount UV necessary kill airborne virus particles would dramatically exceed levels deemed safe humans. best kill via UV filtering air, little late already spent 10 minutes standing talking someone. say Ferris Bueller, lose testicle. Ew, I’m sorry Mods general plague. Nobody wants listen someone wants pandemic last forever Uhhhh okay dude, careful

I “recovered” October testing positive 10/8; thought could work 13-hour workday 11/30, symptoms came roaring back kicked ass week That's gonna happen. We're getting doses till June earliest. 

We 3 million divided across 50 states that's it. going least another year. stop 9/11 comparisons? See, don’t need worry COVID, even 107 year old survived it

/s federal govt abandoned us. 
 
Bingo. accurately, Trump administration senate. Democrats fighting hard economic rescue, coward corrupt senate majority letting country starve. Ur vast minority made bunch rules based science expecting others follow arbitrary rules. 

I'm tired people done shit last 9 months get pretend helped shit. jack fuck. priveleged entitled. make others feel bad following fucking rules given. 

Nobody asked leave house. Shut fuck up. U feel like one many people stupid are. Provincetown, Mass. Year round population 3,000. Going wedding felt wrong. going wedding felt wrong. Adulting fun Aww, passed trig. contagious virus 2019 killed 300 thousand counting really bad trying obtuse?

This may shocker you. people *do* actually die viruses 😱. know viruses REALLY new concept you, everyone immortal them. believe not, (I know it’s hard westerners understand) die day. 

Get news. wouldn’t haven’t noticed shit otherwise. 

This brain sucks.  looks like queen wearing mask aussies sure smug bunch, thought well reading comment. Aussie shit smells like roses, ya mate? Throw another shrimp barbie ya.

By way, better hope covid cases ever make right back lockdown. government decided even one case many. 3 million vaccines divided across 50 states chance get till least June. 

We've still got least another year this. stop downplaying this. currently it, feel like shit 24/7. joke.  never catch it, spreading it? That’s disturbing thought Back pile! keep hearing Thanksgiving infections haven’t hit us yet turkey day 16 days ago. 

Incubation period 3-14 days (last checked). 

How seeing infections thanksgiving yet? weak move can’t forever it’ll destroy economy society. measures eventually end would tell vaccine prevents asymptomatic infections, tell prevents people infecting others

You'd run antibody tests contacts well You’re drama mongering. headline says cdc monitor sees relationship. literally downplays link. Please stop. hadn’t hear that. link?  Yes no, may done 10 years worth studies quantity, know long term effects vaccine could 10 years now. misunderstand me, can't wait long test that, urgent situation now, completely invalid concern. many countries locked earlier? many fail in? 😂😂😂 guy asked possible dont get sick another non deadly virus gave immunity SARS-COV2. would mean a) wide spread people worldwide dont get sick b) would still wide spread virus would endemic c) would found widespread. dispersion lead virus disappearing, yes, virus widespread. hundreds always 3 ten example superspread it. cases course possibility ""run dead"", said, must widespread give alot people immunity, dispersion plays role. might best celebrity impersonation I've ever seen challenger Queen Elizabeth England, mean? battle shall legendary.  God horrible pictures.

I really hope publicity Covid minks help people realize bad conditions farms make stop buying fur coats already. Nah, he's driving much traffic. That's 180k-270k minimum..... minimum! hit 300k 10 months. going possibly equal much 3 f-ing months! Well, guys already thousands corpses... Several hundred dollars, per person. Salt troll! put Laura Ingraham Fox News earlier thinking may see crying big Trump news today, swear God still arguing flu deadly. said scientists say total number infected could ten times current known number. proceeded divide number confirmed deaths hypothetical number cases got roughly 0.2% fatality rate. said anyone says rate higher liar, encouragement doctor guest. 86 experience, kids taking seriously parents. 

In example, siblings getting shit parents saying Christmas year.

Same family. That's really good point. reason stay-at-home order. u understand UV....fully... „germ theory“? 

Oh Internet full shit lately ever. US losing, average, ten times number people per day WWII combat deaths. May ask live? 50% effective first second shot, controlled data, can’t draw full proof data. FDA estimate 82% efficacy. That's called Spanish flu, yep. first thing taught history class took Bezos' 180BN gave equal portion 330 Million Americans we'd $550 richer. 6 Bezoses would give us amazing amount $3300 might last us 3-4 months. wildly gross simplification exaggeration guillain barre syndrome really...that means nothing.

Blinded germ theory....study environment. Okay [CDC estimates much especially you’re 70, majority people 50 world realize week, right? could’ve easily asymptomatic mildly symptomatic employee infected 100 people time frame. K, Cancer. Fuck I’ll 606,000 US deaths year. 12.5 million globally  BSN enough know better month half. America fucked long time.

America proven one worst countries earth. garbage Americans done last year stay forever. Americans horrible people.  I've wondering 2020 climax America's collapse. think might be. whole decade could end rough hell. Pfizer said they’re going run N-assay entire vaccine group see blocked infections entirely. vaccine generates protein antibodies, N exists, specific COVID anyways, means infected enough generate additional antibodies. Nah dude get haha, good hear rationality people instead circle jerking memes day. think new Zealand's difficult get permanent residency Australia honestly know easier people coming America places going you.



I've probably got small view subject, came broken house managed shake ""homeless"" label couple years ago travellings definitely something Ive ever done, love beautiful country is. definitely bucket list holiday destinations never visited. whole giant spider thing totally overblown online. I've seen like 1 spider past 3 months, average garden spider, avoid Sydney... That's [funnel Web lives total nightmare fuelled guarenteed death machines. lost family member covid today. Wish could made long enough see vaccine happen. Hopefully means lose anyone else soon.  fake, misrepresented. 6 people died course vaccine trial due unrelated causes. Get head ass. It’s red, it’s trump. It’s deep. Better? Dude deaths gonna increase next month. Stop acting like everything prefect nothing bad ever happened.

It's humanity never learn mistakes garbage humans were. gf Philippines I'm lot trouble convincing get apparently really messed dengue vaccine killed kids (but that's apparently dengue far worse antibodies it). 🥰

Nice thanked always appreciated They've worked well, they're final nuclear option halt widespread community transmission. novel vaccine well. There's history mRNA vaccines.  glad read link, good point first summer life go swimming once, first holiday season (and won't) set foot inside store.  Let’s hope distribution isn’t botched everything else been.

I call naive. Land free, everyone Surely, tell COVID response wasn’t botched. Like, it’s awesome vaccine, Phizer wasn’t even produced US nearly 300k people died meanwhile. Largely depend Moderna rollout distribution efficiency. Could probably early beginning Feb maybe late April. disputing something going on...but huge EXAGGERATION component! nothingburger, superfatburger either - moment. 

THen also explain countries, death rate almost zippo despite high cases. Hint: Check Qatar start.

I already answers...because homework. Democrats ability get anything done ever know why. can't even time desperation ramp enough public outrage pass simple bill?



Why Biden alarming world can't get anyone penny more?


A: fact care. (Which believe)

B: he's Democrat cant anything like Obama couldn't. (This party failures)



Even Trump stimulus checks.


If Biden issues none Trump wanted to, he's one done nothing politician office.


Have fun left wing 4 years, nobody America forget 4 years give dime. Fire her, disgrace 86 year old dies today covid worse 30 year old dying 56 years something else lose year life socially?

As uncomfortable admit, people die covid old. flu deadly people 50. Hahaha noted. got married Feb 25, 2015.... Ed Sheeran Brit Award dreadful song ""Uptown Funk"".

My life lined tragedy. Decent! I'd keep away use separate bathrooms can. Viral load seems lot outcomes, add viral load possibly help it. 

But u/youBoughtTheTop also right, pretty sure husband got COVID we'd ignoring helping out, old folks. nurses 🤔 following news lately hope things go well, we're still 2020 all! really think test every annual flu shot 10-15 years? know general mechanisms vaccines.

Think it, make hybrid variety apple that's new world need tested poison first? No, know apples general human safe simply variances make-up miraculously turn killer.

Also Covid appears long term effects anyway exactly avoiding opting something known complications. Yup :( that’s exponential growth, initially hotspots coast got contained, it’s it’s like frog boiling pot water let get bad vaccines started getting closer it’ll subsides. us saw tried warning other, it’s getting bad let’s hunker more… funny. situation terrible want take enjoy all. laughing. Sorry. mention tent treatment centers, even non-covid... like heart attacks, car accidents, etc.

Do suppose that's staff things? president made vaccines weird political ""warp speed"" crap, wouldnt hesitancy. searching hard silver bullet save presidency one trusts anything. Fuck “misinformation” ministry truth echo chamber. crime humanity People like part problem well. Spreading false propaganda people problem B people not. Coming Flint MI seeing people constantly blaming saying white republicans problem beyond cringe. challenge anyone Michigan visit local big city like Saginaw, Detroit Flint tell demographic see wearing masks. top dare confront them. 

Good luck. Shit like enrages end. parents (both 70 years old) contracted covid survived. mom left permanent lung damage. mom diabetes type 2, dad shortage white blood cells. Two parents friends mine died within days. parents could died well.

Now mother reads conspiracy blogs anti-vaxx anti-face mask. thinks corona measures imposed government draconian facemasks worthless. time likely infected people without facemasks.

It enrages fucking much. Every time try point fallacies reasoning turns heated argument real. fucking. fast. I'm fucking fed up. thank keeping everyone safe :) Apparently triaging. Essentially sending home older patients try save younger ones. Tree-fiddy? God damn Loch Ness monsta! healthcare worker , currently working, agree. need staff healthy care PEOPLE! know we’re focused COVID many illnesses bring people hospital/clinical settings. vulnerable always vulnerable. next line. treat caregivers first.

Because paralysed sedated fully, may think assaulted nurses obs hang new IV saline.

About 30% experience depression 40% report cognitive impairment par moderate brain injury. pretty bad situation. many people can’t afford lock down, work jobs front line. Masks great, they’re 100%, especially there’s marginal compliance among people around you.

Once hospitals get overwhelmed need start sending people back home need admitted Case Fatality Rate (CFR) skyrocket.  everyone people need admitted aren’t admitted die.   

During Italy’s crisis CFR regions almost 10% hospitals weren’t completely full.  

Right U.S. CFR 1.2%.

If we’re 3,000 deaths per day CFR 1.2%, happens CFR regions gets 9 10%?  

What happens hospitals across U.S become full U.S. CFR goes 9 10%?  

Daily death totals could hit 12,000 20,000. True. found something different dosing brought ~90%, think needs investigated further. people won’t wearing masks gone eradication summer.

I think argumentative, earlier tests mature widely available, hence discrepancy percentages. 1 percent lot, can't say due contamination lab errors more. trying shift argument evidence rubbish, evidence prove reasonable doubt. think rest case. “Save sociopaths, capitalism!”

It can't explained simpler. stupidity knows bounds seems.  people take measures covid, sure hell wont take flu.  get slaughtered police protesting? People losing livelihoods results deaths well.

The correct answer need shut non-essential businesses government needs help financially, unfortunately people government ability keep happening they’re exactly that. Yes will. mask, fuck early retirement Fuck government sub wrecking peoples livelihood goddamn flu. never got impression they've dismissed virus... way back since March-April telling us daily serious please take precautions.

Liquor licenses way control much / long alcohol served, there's legal tools finely adjust restaurants conduct beyond that. guess could instigate new laws, take since adding exceptions legal foundations decades ago.

How Sweden's fault problem whatever politicians around world choose use as? misunderstand us them.

Da fuck talking about? said that’s 100 weeks heard immunity. merely corrected math saying it’s like 20. Yeah, people going die, shit, nothing bad math. I'm saying understand Snopes thing sent, non story spreading around, baseless propoganda disproven. Passing around gives validity.

If near someone sick intubated I'd take silkwood shower afterwards. realize probably nonsense scientifically accurate, stating attitude would be. death happening hospitals may counted time, maybe we'll see count stagnate while. “nah” sounds like “wah” lots people don’t best immune systems.

It’s Transmission rate (R-value) super spreading events (k-value). higher Covid-19 influenza. think striking flint r-value number sparks made, k-value number sparks ultimately result fire.

The k-value really important disease initially become epidemic eventually pandemic. Reduced travel mass gathering events bring k-value means take longer influenza really get strong foothold. typical flu season begins see strong growth ~early December. likely take longer become widespread season.

The r-value (average number people infected single person) reduced result masking, social distancing behavioral changes mandates. number target “flatten curve” slogan. Covid number 2.5 measures place currently ~1.2 US. number 1, number people recovering becomes greater new infections eventually would end pandemic. sustained periods &lt;1 short periods let’s Country (most northeast summer 2020).

For influenza value 1.5, it’s lower less robust virus, natural immunities built annual exposure least partially effective vaccinations. Since viruses spread similar pathways additional measures place (masking, distancing, etc.) drop Covid R-value 2.5 1.2 May bring Influenza 1.5 &lt;1.0, keep virus endemic prevent widespread infection. told such.

Me, one last get covid, literally house full virus choice matter. course, inevitably caught Covid could take 10 days recover.

I can't imagine revolving door covid cases coming last ~12 months. I'd wanna quit too.

It literally turns co-workers bitter, due higher-ups ill prepared things hit fan. Fortunately clients staff (many high risk) ""recovered"" without anyone dying.

Meanwhile live SF Bay Area nearest hospital 100% full ICU, county 12% ICU capacity left yesterday 1100 new cases. soooo many people neighborhood walking around masks, restaurants full store employees taking masks whenever could get away it. like people decided done playing pandemic.  Man, really underestimate capitalism lol. immunity builds population also becomes likely virus actually evolve less fit (less contagious / lower R0 value) strains order immune evasion.

You may COVID-19 symptoms could develop late quarantine leaving quarantine contagious.

You could also asked quarantine get positive test. positive test quarantine twice six months. Except it...doesn’t be? Like literally every first world country, instead letting small businesses die leaving millions Americans streets, could instead compensate business owners everybody wins.

I agree actually much data justifying closure gyms fitness studios (I run one I'm presently closed due rising covid rates city, dangerously close closing permanently) issue procedural one, would question mad it.  like they're woke. wearing mask selfish. ""OMG! happened ME!"" selfish. Lots MLM loving, Trump supporting, 'maybe vaccinate kids' nurses area seriously scary. Fauci thinking early spring we'll vaccinating high-risk groups opening gates general population last heard. if... mandatory testing everyone work anywhere home? happen. man, would help. believe culturally, Japan way open idea wearing masks kind protection public anyways. America obsessed “freedom” lot people’s mind anything isn’t freedom privilege instantly feels like oppression.

""Legit"" sticking point. would inline suing Toyota provided ability go get accident.  military always known 30-40% stupid rule. Onky donky plan open soon vaccines readily flowing general population via allowing people proof vaccination buy tickets enter

We're going enter domino effect things quickly reopening pandemic ending social standpoint lot faster people think Garnish company till end time. Bankruptcy. Take stuff.  fine business,or him?  would make big difference too. Also, half country risk include obesity

Anyone cared could lost 50+ pounds since March. isn't. damn sure good example unprepared pandemic response vulnerable biological attacks. pretty clear disease could easily end society know government/military able act time save us. phrases better said. writing definitely least sent google translate. fined physically forced close doors? imagine? Go r/conspiracy see show lol. 


I like use shbreddit gage overall sanity It’s also bad idea use debit card. Don’t it. tied bank account meaning someone steal get pin, going lose every penny account rectified. 

Some banks good give courtesy send help report fraud. Others make prove didn’t make purchases reimbursing you. 

Get rid debit card. Use credit card buy things issue aren’t losing money. tell Credit Card Co didn’t won’t make pay bill determine fraud not. also build credit get points use, something can’t debit card.

I’ve see many people get wiped debit cards. Unless using PubMED medical research, I'm going go ahead ignore you. cost 1 person getting hospitalized covid would easily cover rent months.  strap torture method vaccines now. wonder well ever find fully erase possibility infection. may keep spreading. business runs severe risk permanent closure unable conduct said business amount time. Also temporary closure impact budget payroll could lead positions eliminated. Healthcare country tied employment, limiting business eliminating jobs literally creating health crisis. 

And admit dependents, makes sense advocating someone take away means providing them. mortgage, car payment, retirement savings, buying groceries? means obtaining money told can’t work it? It’s clear federal government going providing assistance lost funds. suggest becomes job? try think situation one. hospital. one day, likely, mandatory like flu shot antibody titers Amen that, gym happy place don’t know would got shut would love try something cool like that. bonus get know got cool smell gene read comments I've made r/conspiracy rather assuming I'm covid denier. actively argue real. fun. Sometimes minds change. 

Also, would asking somebody confirm post real price real? fuck lol. Hope whole business meeting culture changes (where possible, course). work intn'l secretariat surprising travel Vienna, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Egypt, Latam, Davos etc hand brochures deliver half day workshops forced audience. Also depends where. Supposedly California place SARS (or whatever) they'll using here. Also, bit Ford getting large capacity chillers could inoculate workforce.

It really seems like going random ad hoc. remember getting downvoted months ago, predicted rural communities going get hammered eventually, refusal take safeguards seriously would come back bite ass. expect 5k deaths day around Christmas, 6-7k / day early January. side effects? care comment removed. report me, boo hoo. i'm glad saw it, arrogant dummy. summer 12 days here, we've control while. worst took place Autumn Winter.

I think relevant. Although perhaps summer peak people may tempted break restrictions socialise. appealing us cold outside.  know, pecan pie *criminal*. Outkick garbage site Portnoy garbage person union-busting scumbag Apparently can't make jokes thread. That's sickening. Damn, already? death toll hit 200,000 like month ago? though? lot discussion twitter. one sure long term immunity one dose wasn’t explicitly studied, second makes almost difference *initial* efficacy. New cases fall dramatically 10 days first dose. may last months. It’s also possible second dose needed elderly weak immune systems. Holding back second dose case distribution problems means thousands people die unnecessarily (as Scott Gottlieb agrees) 

Dr. Michael Mina thread Right on. Glad you’re keeping mask candor up. Sorry you’ve gotta serve people lack compassion. half dose gave smaller segment trial mistake, mixing different lots, didn’t give population needs vaccine most? 0 evidence dosing regimen works people 55. LOL what? even comprehend blazing speed went COVID appearing scene, vaccines injected humans outside context clinical trial? literal revolution eat rich point.

Doubtful. rich always find one poor defend another poor. Sometimes even pay them, say ""look customers put harms way (and contacts).

And contacts' contacts, on. people die people choosing take risk. like running skydiving business, occasionally people knew getting die. im curious too. give sources vaccine related deaths long term side effects? never find anything duckduckgo vaccinators getting vaccinated first? turned 32 2 weeks ago, keep thinking I’m 30. reason Swedes explaining strategy precisely many misunderstandings it. look article thread about. flat wrong. ""U-turn"" happening.

What exactly ""the bigger picture"" here, ignoring it? seems like arguing bad faith. Around world? Except literally India handled COVID worse United States, even India better prognosis end they're still ahead. Walmart getting Lysol Clorox products small batches lately. Still can’t find Lysol off-brand aerosol disinfectant spray though. FYI... can’t find disinfectant wipes, use Lysol brand multipurpose (lemon) spray/bottle works diluted. usually wet paper towel, ring spray Lysol multipurpose spray wipe surfaces, etc. prefer actually doesn’t dry fast. Australia others long countries situations like Austria Belgium work together

Yep that's point. Australia control virus without hope countries ball. rest world wildest control outbreak care. average European country best hope maybe eradicate virus internally soon open borders, gonna necessary point (and even don't), get fucked right ass one neighbouring country same. Fingers crossed you! First off, would require alien-like technology, likely beyond anything government would able create. Also, many ways one spied smartphones, PCs, voice assistants, etc. So, would essentially need chips. whole theory simply add way. 

This one illogical, nonsensical theories ever heard. level, people believe probably actually convinced microchips vaccine. want excuse refuse it, nonsense best could come with. Yes, so-called ""conspiracy theories"" end true. blatant load crap. Damn people really want acknowledge sub.  want see got information... clearly don’t want show Got .net site explains this? Yes also tens millions naturally immune Luckily landlords aren’t hounding us still may able open future. Could worse guess.

Moderna supplying another 100 million doses post approval (estimated next week)
Then (hopefully) another 100 million J&amp;J (maybe February) another 100 million AstraZeneca (possibly March). 😳 excluding Moderna another 100m doses. First tragedy, farce I’m sure bartenders servers major cities make 500 night sometimes governments going pay that? Barbers nail techs strippers you’re talking hundreds thousands people income great idea, they're gonna downvote anyways small brain syndrome. can’t use google, perfect guinea pig 💯 Two things could make sanitation wipes seen back shelves. Either changes government would allow government use US defense powers force companies increase production lot more. wait pandemic mostly over. Seriously. mask needed socially distance really don’t get unbelievably fucking hard people understand goalposts shifted every turn people discouraged living even slightly enjoyable lives almost year now, people give up. vaccines.  read word word? feel like we're talking other. feel absolutely heartbroken doctors nurses hospital workers underpaid overworked here, done it?

Cashiers go strike one harmed. Janitors go strike one harmed. Doctors stuff? People *die*. need voice. need heard. need benefits like everyone else.

But without ability strike---because people probably won't, entered healthcare want *save* lives all, get voice, opportunity? sudden everyone gunna supposedly ""severe allergies""  Portnoy douche  Yes, understand that’s article saying. sharing place work does, saying standard everywhere, unfortunately clearly isn’t. Get zinc lozenges vitamin C D3 can. Haha yeah tru, it’s place. way average 5k deaths day next 20 days.

I would invite go work night shift hospital. Pick one. side educated. I’m WA too! Sorry shut bar 😕 ""It states...""

We functioning federal government. failed country people EVERY step way. Ugh... remember let happen. Trump said beat virus,  everything fine now. /s Actually, is.

In order save 6000 people couple days, (a) identify everyone who'll exposed COVID T+2 3 days (since first dose offers decent protection, 95% like T+30), (b) figure amongst people ultimately die *then* (c) get vaccine immediately.

So realistically ""saving"" anyone. Instead, installing doubt amongst thousands idiots delay getting vaccine, undoubtably killing people come contact vaccine deployed.

tl;dr: math. Shit, that's 1 every 500 people dead wtf yet nothing happen precious London



You watch ""It is"" predicted 300k months end. 15 days off. Thanks efforts hardworking scientists medical professionals around world.

Also credit governments funded operation get one party suddenly total fucking jews purse strings 4 year spending spree. 

They also want jump start economy new president take over. Lol getting downvoted. Literally single logical flaw whole spiel. People sub fucking stupid capacity independent thought outside following narrative. dead January 2

I feel like we’d lucky 362,000 deaths January 2nd, seeing luck feel like we’re going lot closer 400,000 deaths time. Jokes covid already ED! Muhahah That’s true, irrelevant. simple fact always death, deaths related Covid-19 unique could prevented following recommended safety guidelines.

People dying hundreds thousands couldn’t bothered needed protect them. literally ourselves. Hope Doctors Nurses Medical Personnel get first. Would make MUCH easier MICH less risky take care COVID Patients get well! Wow.. vast majority dying can't take grave stupidity. Corona deaths different story. That's saying something. delay week 20000 deaths. stall further. dumberest reading concern well. really hope goes well wipe out... WH want numbers posted. That's entire reason said states stop posting them. say year? patterns we’ve traced since spring hold true, worst yet come**  Fair enough. Messaging may *little* consistent Northern CA, right . . . state local agencies getting communication better line. Maybe people within individual offices have, shall say, differences opinion, evolving situation. could lot better. called exactly this, toxic positivity, laughed me! Honestly, morons aren’t worth anymore. Yeah, forget interest rates ever going again. 

Also, what's going happen high-end restaurants cater wealthy afford pay $250 plus drinks steak dinner take prime real estate build handle future restrictions. Affordable family places able though. there'll Ruth's Chris Arby's. Ok stay home keep body away people Novavax promising indeed Dude idk even happened, mean protocols stablished since beginning year. Im already seeing people social media feeds whining recent allergy reactions reported. Even though reports actually indicate normal process GOOD sign discovered early, people still fear mongering hell it.

 


If allergic reactions affect less one million people means virtually non-issue compared billions people affected covid worldwide. ooh scary headline! They're literally concerned insurance payout get severe reaction forced vaccine job.

 


No one forced vaccine. jobs voluntary. two nurses develop reactions recovered within 3 days, lasting effects. 

 


Im dreading much worse people interpret data fear inducing headlines coming months. hospital full, lot people start dying. already seeing rural hospitals beyond capacity.  Nope. Trump buying enough hasn’t kicked yet. still first purchase. state told number Pfizer said short shipping due manufacturing problems. really relatably written. Yes nappy diaper. want wear adult diapers instead going toilet live next door funeral home. go outside often, hunkered months, every time go day parking lot full. I’m gonna need get back March first lol. Lose 10 pounds, highlight hair, get back skin/hair regimen, nice makeup, etc. it’s hoes lol 😘 guy Joe Rogan right. going least 500k deaths even though ""tried"" contain it. dropped 3000 people Wow Mexico beats US punch. Star Wars 2020: Makes Holiday Special look good. know local hospitals lottery system Sorry, don’t know you’re talking about. We’re still mostly seeing november deaths reported now. It’s almost over. waited long like tsunami waves. Oh, right. murderers rapists. We're afraid people. mods subreddit trash HELLYEAH Vegas end February work conference (not CES) pretty sure got covid trip. hindsight, wild think totally aware thought really going China still willingly congregating huge groups. constantly think strip walking crowds possibly infecting people unknowingly incubating. Apparently US best pandemic plan world paper too. lot countries used least parts great effect hear. 

The people respective countries might turned significany variable determining outcome, though. Fucking finally! you’re going let us know you’ve asked out, right?? 🥸🥳 I'd rather vaccine injected arm, guess... people went ape-shit abandoning civil rights democracy, “pulled together “ fight terrorists hit home “ (for 3rd time ). intellectually malleable fools cannot . us know people don’t.   trump cult smooth brain morons don’t understand voting science electoral college doesn’t mean humor them. death toll double within 3 months!!! Same!! Even little things like brunch girls shopping Sephora without masks/distancing/restrictions general. sad!!! Definitely sake frontline healthcare workers well. Even get vaccinated first, lives return back normal long time. can't even imagine exhausted feel right now. Wonderful, thank you!! Australia domestic borders, almost entirely contained outbreaks within states resulting clusters swiftly contained. fact it’s called Victoria, hell even Melbourne, outbreak hint. like 35k flu deaths last year. We’re 293k covid deaths. would say that’s qualitatively different. 3 6 months easy enough wear mask minimal socialising. Better 2 5 years us get immune enough anyone really susceptible dead already. virus created Muslim country Middle East.
The republicans would something they’re brain dead supporters would wearing masks isolating. Im really afraid brutal winter. relief essential workers still sitting petri dish areas. people making die?! different world DC. Science matters here. Masks indoors outdoors. Even grocery lines distanced u shop one direction emergency USE mean exactly? Someone ICU essentially getting vaccine? late? ship time final approvals coming down?

Wasn't happening already? heard stories hospitals already vaccines stuff. Also states knew many doses they'd getting literally next week kind movement needed happening finally Thank mentioning heroic scientists behind BioNTech! story inspiring. good article them!

[How Couple’s Quest Cure Cancer Led West’s First Covid-19 Type “zombie apocalypse” Twitter wanna laugh saw grocery store yesterday, too! Actually vaccine said work always advertised since beginning. flu vaccine works I’m hopeful reduction - see study starts somewhat effective 10 days first shot. Even 50% would help.  Trump thank. made fucking mask political. Canada 80% COVID deaths among nursing home residents. Nursing home residents long world. US average duration stay around 6 months--about 3 men. 

I'd say solid majority least. damn fine 😭😭😭😭😭 daddy af rollout vaccine going leave people upset disappointed. it’s start. can’t get discouraged. isn’t traditional vaccine, it’s designed prevent symptoms occurring covid prevent death, get shot person giving explain better Great title lion king part 20. funny thing would’ve stayed job, would’ve one first vaccinated. 

But I’m part normal population lol. Regardless, I’m stoked finally get vaccine! million die year Yes us friends, situation different lol  Suuurrree. Everything go smoothly favoritism towards rich famous people. forget along 'savings' pensions care state also means loss lot jobs businesses service elderly care sector. similar babies children contribute tax adulthood provide jobs/business economy food, clothing, toys, education healthcare need. Nope..trump administration buying enough

Edit:

Florida also didn’t give damn covid so.. Worldwide demand? I'm saying certainly take ramp production Ok. already forgotten OP part. work lot people say stuff like time stuck that’s people think.

Edit. Nope saying thought. replied saying wasn’t different flu deaths. Actually, check even local data usa, counties instituted mask mandates markedly lower rates infection deaths. short, conclusion wrong. Thanks! NEEXXXXTTTTTT  restrictions enforced. Almost useless understand people still trouble getting this.

Pandemic = stay fuck home. End story!

You'd think people hear people dying single day, might start thinking ""Hhmmm, maybe skip holidays year."" first step many

I prefer term ""One giant leap mankind."" still 1k upvotes? huge! vaccines flaws? 

Nobody denying that? symptoms fun. Duh. know implying they're trying hide? fact vaccines unpleasant? think dying moreso unpleasant. think losing loved one moreso unpleasant. 

The point save lives, period. 

You're definitely 6 feet sand. ever taken biology course? history course? degree two? confirm. - 32 year old. I'm going miss people consider valid excuse things. it, folks. Except seems ongoing health problems caused Covid people. age groups. someone doesn’t die doesn’t mean aren’t impacted. History making. finish line sight. sad seeing raging pandemic taking American lives insane right. lost good friend pandemic. Here's hoping Americans come vaccine help end pandemic. know sooo many people social feeds reposting false vaccine memes info posts. death negative outcome. get car accident leg gets crushed may wake find amputated instead repaired simply spare entire surgical team 10 hours would necessary fix it. 

It's extreme example, hospitals next weeks going using battlefield triage stabilization techniques simply time manpower offer type delicate personalized care people become accustomed to. That’s slightly full time minimum wage job pays month taxes people get old, body's defense repair mechanisms break down. modern, industrialized world, use science, money, medicine keep frail, sickly people alive months even years they're ultimately killed heart disease, cancer, stroke, organ failure, contagious illness. 

This year contagious illness novel, maybe two three times efficient regular one, altogether situation really qualitatively different bad flu year. nothing sympathy those, know many personally myself, i'm slightly better sense need feed myself, still fall need work i'm trouble category, finger pointing categorizing gets skin. like people keep saying ""stop calling us heroes putting this,"" whenever see post praising medical workers going hell. 

I'm tired people using excuses getting bad instead finding creative workarounds continue safe get vaccinated. Novavax’s one, Imperial College London’s track finish trials soon. AZ’a trial results still scrutiny Shhh mate we're trying keep seppos We. Aren't. Waiting.

Hard stop. Get vaccine don't, refuse business business go Lockdown socially distant others take vaccine.

Want risk, guest, time next fall bitching lack distancing vaccine available you. Moderna works efficacy? Without storage holdup might add. Lol really they’re better prospect. Secondly, don’t know AstraZenecas efficacy yet. mean never taking mask hurts nobody, anti-vaxx mask get people sick killed. right side on, case hurt overly cautious. horrifying me. fucking maskless wonders walk around big smiles face honest chance they're going directly responsible someone's death.

I'm horrified. afraid get / get it, I'll statistic. I'm shape... ate like shit years. I'm terrified getting virus now... wrote got image comment like, morbid reality activity account ceases fucking die... scared... living life pretty much alone help feel better either. ""enough"" people? far back push goal posts collective mental state society deteriorates around us? understand surface looks weird sample size 4 vs zero really strange statistically. 5 vs 1 probably wouldn’t get much scrutiny. I'm reserve. get special release. Yes, challenges lay ahead. But, past 2 million years proven anything, humans species triumphs. crushed Spanish Flu pandemic, split atom, landed Moon. give 3/4 world vaccine. justice based state governed wrt it’s response, Florida would last. think they’ve shipping things least week. mean right though. offered high price, US negotiated got outbidded countries. dam vaccines NOW, Dr. Hahn*

I guess should’ve ran trials administration working kinks last 11 months them. told March going lose 40 pounds really go. Exercise more, get healthier, eat better moderation.

Yep, flabby forty still here. least didn’t gain covid fifteen like friends? America relevant post Germany? Shit, science somewhere Buddy told leading scientists lifestyle choices going change warming planet fast rate. science straight telling reopening way wrong. either accept stamp feet ignore reality. Yes, know many people actually get vaccinated. I've heard 50% reluctant. 
Subtract population 75 children, around 255 people left. Half 127.5 M. 150 plenty, vaccines might way. would comfortable ordered Pfizer one, though.

I've heard Ohio data reporting issues, spikes backlogs gotten through. 2 Brain cells play keeps COVID away. attitude seems know, means yes, spread it. 

The reality know, many previous vaccines, answer ""no, can't spread it"". 

Given number reinfections staggeringly low data showing similar immune response wild infection vaccination, personal thought we'll end data showing something closer ""probably not"".  think they're probably trying make people aware things end overnight vaccine here. distribution vaccine likely take months point majority vaccinated notice considerable drop hospitalisations cases(we'll never eradicate covid completely make non issue). January we'll walking around without masks etc. It'll slow gradual ease hopefully say next summer may able return normality depending fast vaccine rolled children's dicks destroyed CIA missile

People bring ""low death rate"" normally trolls. I'm giving benefit doubt. Didnt germans mindset american covid deniers? so, US look forward to? He's extremely accomplished surgeon done well government. sure cognitive leap come from? man literally medal freedom.

Are racist? accomplishments black man good enough you? mean, they're right practical sense. restrictions pretty much dropped ages 60+ get vaccinated. ages 60+ get vaccinated well healthcare workers, pandemic over. Follow yelling, where’s face condom? see Covid herpes! Yeah wait didn’t think haha, that’s true. People need responsible tho. right wing country trying create emergency. end know, imagine.  difference make. Like said vaccinese ""rushed vaccine"" category. understand people desperate take vaccine want pamdemic mean get anti-science dismiss dangers vaccine proven SAFE effective. first dictum medicine first harm. Even fauci said this. rushed vaccines potentially violate dictum.   correct population ie case per million population. California looks mild comparison states. OH/TX/CO/ky 5 cases every 4 CA has.

Now correct deaths population even lower. CA half states. brother anymore....

It’s bad advice, basically forced listen hours years ago, heard, repeated many different ways.  blood type?  guess would weigh thousands deaths. clearly do. Lol, wait, what? it. good gonna get that's life gets back normal. fact even 95% effective goddamn MIRACLE ever one. Holy shit people INSANE...

If 95% effective good enough life go back normal, life NEVER go back normal. seatbelts, floatation devices airplanes VACCINES... reduce deaths level living life assuming people vaccinated considered acceptable risk. That's known beginning catch thing once. Care bundle Trump streaks. Chicago flagrant they'll slap 10k fine more. become burden them, send home someone else take care of. It’s sad. think underestimate massive amount layoffs occured print newspaper industry last 10 years so. Digital ads pay far less print. means wall street outbid them. That's efficacy works. daily deaths keep going up, could hit 500k February. means express words. appreciate sharing IIRC total excess death toll year much higher official covid death toll probably right. imagine we'll higher estimate many died. sure compared medical specialists fields, that's point 😂compared average American, especially average antivaxxer, Goes Thanksgiving celebration middle pandemic tests positive *surprised pikachu face* I'm still trying figure tile cleaner went. seen nearly year.  really sad. it’s historically unusual, people used lot interaction elders family modern times.

Thats heard....people moving mass droves Texas.... One restaurant know WA got 70K fine. Ouch. Yeah, year's flu season seems long difficult.  I’m fan apocalyptic fiction. article reads lot like that, except without “fiction” part.  hit main issue. I've yet find mask comfortable enough leave alone.

Yep did. hurt. Yesterday comment facebook news article elderly people dying local nursing home. woman said: well elderly people die day right? bad whatever. recieved soo much backlash, 200+ angry comments, even mom shared meme skull without brain. backlash warmed heart. Fuck woman saying that. She'll get old someday, lets see feels then.

Disclaimer: mom cancer cannot take covid vaccin really worried. Covid kill gets it.  we'll wait see much damage ""other virus"" (online disinformation) done. 1960s, Internet. people still trusted experts. TV channels people got news, none peddled conspiracies. entirely different world. South Korea never locked down...  say revolutionary. work. wheel revolutionary (Well, revolves, know mean), good. elderly vaccinated young party-goers wouldn’t able spread anymore. Vaccinating elderly already nullifies premise. Depends whether make compulsory not. Melbourne, Australia mandatory masks 3 months times outside home. That, coupled strict 3 month lockdown helped health department get cases 0. case well month now. looks like Texas category glitch 155k cases. went back. way already are?

You think little subscriptions Washington Post NY Times make money? No.

Truthfully, really matter two *how* people consume news, make money. They'd better loss leaders free. doubt megawealthy oligarchs like Sulzbergers Bezos would ever notice insignificant income subscription fees.

You're also supposed offering money offering competing product: again, offering product. *News* product, representation already occurred events that. create anything. competing with, exactly? must life party. /S making money sign sound financial advice.

Sure is. crap advice, think he'd make I'm curious he, well financial advisors, still sticking 6 months emergency savings pandemic changed minds.

You think they're saving more? less?  whole emotional moment many people dying &amp; everyone carrying like fucking happening.

It's truly fucking upsetting many levels. May slightly longer Christmas New Years probably cause artificial drop reported deaths many staff kind like saw thanksgiving. imagine deaths artificially drop Christmas stay low New Years staff back  years estimate deaths caused probably shockingly high. 

Most death figures we're given things like annual flu, swine flu, even spanish flu simply estimates looking back. I'ld imagine especially hospitals strained hard accurately keep track died what. I'm sorry hear that. husband going similar losses total loss respect people choose deny severity virus. I'm sure loss inflicted you, please know fully supported strangers conviction spread people care about, well general public. numbers coming Thanksgiving rediculous totally preventable. Again, thank you! prediction peak around 8k deaths per day early February.

And thin herd. essentially one see spike deaths Thanksgiving figure well least last Christmas.  I'm part cherokee well. heard language spoken person, since 6 years old. privilege meeting great great grandmother. 98 met her. age thought must've seen dinosaurs little. look back realize held last cherokee culture family. would love learn myself.  Masks, worn correctly, work. 

Data vs. Anecdote Knowledgable maybe. 

You wouldn’t see dermatologist heart condition. yet many times we’ve got physicians speaking outside expertise people readily listen even they’re wrong. elderly vaccinated, death rate would probably drop 90%.

40% wouldn’t make huge impact randomly selecting people, would massive vaccinating specific risk groups. think need look effects somebody drinks it. turns best vaccine combo, see Americans giving alcohol 56 days. much anybody else, sadly. jackass HR lady went one locations CA (we’re Michigan) positive exposed 24 people. Four already tested positive, entire office plant close everyone getting tested. Rumor she’s still trying fly back even though she’s quarantined hotel pretty intense symptoms. don’t know knew positive flew there. ...and reality. Jesus Christ anti-Americanism Reddit annoying.

Newsflash: US covid death rate right line much Western Europe. Literally first sentence article: 
 federal government says distribute enough doses Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine immunize 2.9 million **Americans** first week US Food Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes it, far less initially discussed 6.4 million doses. Say last words, nasty monster ""there many people here! Yeah may thats point!!!"" Yeah. I'm surprised sheer number people like this, extent. I'm surprised who's selfish-- like yeah, know murders selfish assholes expect kind cousin grew announce care diabetic ass dies; fact, she'll happily kill rather delay shopping trip.

It's hard. need shared morals meaningful relationships people. Like ""human life value"". mean, guess better learn people share beliefs hard come terms with. get info? 

[Best estimated chance dying 0.003%

20-49: 0.02%

50-69: 0.5%

70+ 5.4%

If you’re 70, underlying conditions almost risk.

Different groups affected differently say 1 50 chance dying makes sense, even took average groups don’t think would 2%, especially considering majority people world 50 guess also partially make sure enough doses round 2, since spoil break whatever. Heard Toronto already. Okay do? hang like normal pray get sick it’s bigger evil ? Could elaborate point? see parallelization leads lot data patients trial time.  Yet, patients vaccine number months know long term effects could patients 5, 10 years now? I'm sure vaccines usually side effect right away possible side effects develop later life? I'm sure 97% people without masks assholes

BUT

Some people cannot masks due medical conditions. job we're restricted insisting masks this.

Also isn’t vaccine supposed ? saw coming. warned us. told us holidays would cause massive surge cases/deaths. told us wear masks stay home. listen? Abso-fucking-lutely not. fate deserve then. !remindme 22 days Yes, that’s clinical trial tens thousands volunteers conducted. wedding never coming it? That's bad idea... encouraged people get vaccinated could save lives. Televised live tweeted hashtag #iGotTheVaccine . cant wait get myself! “everything” would guess fall 2021, lot schools might reopen March April. I'm pastor insisted keeping doors closed services online. suffering severe losses... losses life due gathering.

I'm public enemy number one right now. end sending resume churches pandemic over. people angry gotten sick gathering.

That, I'm convinced Jesus would us do. Love neighbor (inside outside church) keeping safe.

Yeah Cali imo example place prob take bit longer Bro literally don’t want give 17 younger you’re saying doesn’t matter? really missed point question never mind something remember decade research done coronavirus’s researchers knew target spike protein. important fund research helps us line. first coronavirus based pandemic we’d totally different scenario right now. people smart. complicated that. Right, healthcare workers long term care residents first. state freedom deciding think it’s fair ask reasoning behind decision since minority. Idk would consider “hounding” much would consider asking reasonable justification. Yes think everything 2019-like June. September-October think stuff like mass events conferences. Beginning end. hope we’ve learned lessons humans trying times. certainly have. I’ve also learned ton am. I’m like moments absolute solitude also feeling like world crumbling around me. can’t wait travel again, close humans again, edge whenever step outside apartment. won’t ever take freedom movement granted ever again. confined nearly year made ready live again. big achievement humanity vaccines.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* probably get normal life back early-late spring That's happened Spanish flu.

What happened government enforced wide spread censorship threatening journalists wrote it, [active anti-mask protests mask wearing (same today), society whole chose forget pretend never happened collective shame. 6m doses. expect 20-40M every month. J&amp;J AZ vaccines approved, would really ramp quickly. easiest manufacture vaccine (Astrazeneca) issues delay US approval. Thats big reason actual number much lower. Cali lol... San Diego honestly thought would contained China. rose coloured blinders on. Wishful thinking. really though beat August. days Canada *zero* deaths 200 new cases 37 million population. Yeah, that's history too. 

Going get hopes vaccine anď let next 6 months play out. Hope tbe best. always knew selfish country, I'll admit Covid surprised administration instinctively corrupt, disgusting. I'm sure trying figure personally profit reward/bribe buddies enable corruption. Give states! That's saying, find invest technology achieves this. Live polio vaccine use since last 20 years. reason they've giving live polio vaccine Sudan save money? Depends go, specifically willingness handle potentially frivolous litigation. Yeah, lack research. However, generally younger people healthy better immune system. So, long severe allergic reactions medicines, immunocompromised, fine. that’s one I’m praying whatever God real (even ‘God’ human ingenuity) land 75 year old mother’s arm suffers COPD That’s nice you’re right. think know well they'll tell us longer 3-6 months.

Since there's people never take it- *and* know yet whether prevents infection spread prevents symptoms- they'll say indefinitely.
You *know* that.

We've already lost year half this. can't afford lose anymore think it’s realistic thinking. head warp speed expects us normal May, Fauci thinks could hit “relative normal” April-July. depend country. Indeed doesn’t sound excessive all.

We couldn’t done wanted though. doubt government could organized money people, it’s mostly cops. 

They won’t enforce covid restrictions. departments immediately state won’t enforcement whenever new restrictions come out.

And can’t fired refusing job. 

They could entirely ignoring thousand serial killers would literally safer. User name checks In.... 1/1000th space? One, pandemic destructive tons great scientists dropped everything work project, effectively unlimited budget. Kind like Manhattan Project. sped things dramatically. Two, virus contagious widespread, trials wait long time enough people got COVID draw conclusions vaccine. Contrast HPV vaccine -- since delay HPV infection cervical cancer years decades, presumably vaccinate someone infected, took much longer prove HPV vaccine prevented cervical cancer. reduction provided people take social distancing protocols masks seriously next two months majority population gets vaccinated. Many health professionals warned throwing caution wind thinking pandemic since vaccines here. Seeing way people followed protocols far, agree previous commenter March-April. fair, amount people giving shit contact tracing, miracle they've caught 100 people. catching covid Friendly's restaurant...that's got hurt. Texans fan, thought safe here. nurses dumb? specifically, many dumb nurses allowed continue nurses? normal vaccine research project, hurry. research team stage one time priority put work needed enable them.

So come proposal, write proposal, initial research show reasons could work, present proposal potential funding committees.

They wait committees decide proposal gets funded, wait longer funds made available agree start date timeline first results.

Since they're likely working small team, results may obtained multiple batches tests.

Once results, need write up, present them, probably get published peer reviewed (and nobody rush that) write new proposal phase 2 testing present committee. agreed again, need go find test subjects human testing run trials.

And on, on. Everything done one step time, waiting absolute conclusion every step people part get done.

In emergency waiting. Everyone gets approved almost automatically. testing done one large simultaneous batch much possible. Results peer-reviewed within days funding pre-approved ready go next stage testing, test candidates pre-selected ready go first stage results approved, results monitored regularly see evidence sufficient yet.

And top that, hundreds teams exact thing. likelihood least one pass tests ahead schedule experience delays failures.

Imagine car broken down. One mechanic assistant might give estimate weeks repair it, right.

If 100 teams 15 mechanics racing fix 100 identical cars, would shocked first team finish done couple hours. sure you’re downvoted, we’re third quarter, far yet Thank you, you’re right. incredibly difficult stay positive Good following dream expecting like exotic warm place lol People keep treating EUA FDA said vaccine safe. EUA means risks worth potential benefit. think completely reasonable low risk person aka work home use instacart wait actual FDA approval. Seems like Pfizer thinks data available haven’t seen evidence that. virus can’t replicate body develop immunity “still full covid”, that’s works. seen evidence show people act transmission vectors infected virus? point there's almost point criticism, show ppl names faces everyday victims.

The US killing themselves... tragic. referencing coronavirus came first place live markets laboratory conditions Yeah, excuse moved slow. explanation moved faster.

We're demanding healthcare workers can't expect regulators? re-write shit article language wrong liberals speak:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Unexpected side effects (probability: news)

The vaccine trials specifically excluded groups people could negative reactions vaccines, like instance people unusually severe allergies. already news bad reactions Pfizer vaccine specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

2) won’t enough vaccine doses everyone (probability: reality)

It take literal year everyone get vaccine, even wanted it. currently rationed frontline medical workers elderly.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Vaccination becomes politicized (probability: news years ago)

""Anti-vax"" large political faction decade point.

&amp;#x200B;

4) could vaccine supply shortages (probability: news)

Pfizer already lowered delivery estimates based material shortages.

&amp;#x200B;

5) People won’t get doses (probability: already happens)

This first vaccine requires multiple doses staged specific times apart. People already this.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Doctors bend truth help patients get vaccine faster (probability: medium)

This silliest problem list. Here's replacement:

6) Medical professionals botch delivery (probability: high low, depending country/class)

The ""hurly burly"" medical practice caused vaccines go bad due lack sufficient refrigeration even developed countries. caused vaccines kill undeveloped nations. people standing line dose medical person changing gloves vectors disease. entire medical system medically literate, not, problem Africa, medical corporate CEO made news refusing wear mask, bottom tier two-tier US health system suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

7) Vaccines exacerbate inequality health care system (probability: inevitable)

What nice way saying ""we're gonna kill bunch black people, there's reason it."" US countries like UK chosen two-tier medical system reflecting two-tier health system. great would abolish class system, neither Biden Fauci strike revolutionary Marxists.

&amp;#x200B;

8) false sense security develops (probability: already happened)

You see chart US cases exactly happened, ie two weeks surge.

&amp;#x200B;

9) Anti-vaxxers amplify misrepresent side effects (probability: already happened)

They've saying Bill Gates going implant tracking nanobots body years. Jayaus war time death numbers dude gonna punch lawsuit right mouth! Don’t let dumbass documents push around bro. Dave good people shit money getting debt. That's it. 

His politics suck. investing advice suspect. make $30,000 drive $40,000 car, he's guy, otherwise, change radio station. 

1387 people developed musculoskeletal connective tissue disorders. know numbers rise well give vaccine . Watch numbers zoom Biden's team takes stops hiding suppressing messing statistics.

And crazy people blame Democrats ""increase"" legit source please. Hmm... medical workers come first US. enough spread high risk don’t equal elderly? 65+ alone 45mish+ ? Manufactured too, first shipment came EU right? Thank goodness EU didn’t pull crap like “EU first” prevented shipped US dad's 80, regularly cycles 50kms regularly looks grandchildren. idea every 80 year old frail geriatric deaths door seems get floated regularly nonsense. Trump republicans fucking guilty dereliction official duty gross negligence leading mass death.

Their inaction often times negative counteraction disaster.

9/11 never forget?

Never forget 300k lives lost due trump's fuckery. You’re wrong. Although, you’re interested using pertinent information, could say pandemic president ignored cause addition amount deaths greater lost 9/11. small percentage elderly people live nursing homes though Yeah anyone's fault. Again, payments leases frozen August evictions extended January 2021. Since extended 2 times now, extended again.
What landlords suing NYS tenants. lawsuits archived. Wishful thinking. like end 2021 beginning 2022. Cause, dude dude, you’re loser attitude, height, keeps getting laid. exactly need eyes? Shrug shoulders say “oh well”?? understand type hesitancy. also needs pointed (and fact talked point friend well), due nature RNA based vaccine, actual viral loads sense major vector complications quite literally absent. major source complications RNA based vaccine beyond typical allergies vaccine ingredients would body's antibody response, would exist viral based vaccine anyways. untested, prudent caution, appears intrinsically safer form vaccination. expect lot parties gatherings summer.

Thats highly irrisposible. reason Pfizer vaccine two doses month part anyone immune.

This may take Dude. stand lab day trying figure potential drug fits mechanisms structure f**ing virus. Don’t come „do know UV though“?

So: yes, really. calculate dividing deaths cases. Ideally use country control, deaths lag behind detected cases. USA around 98% last time calculated it, taking account lag, push survival rate little. Yeah, theory March. sun would bake virus. then, know, Florida happened July. No, we're changing light bulb. no, wearing mask avoiding crowds, healthier ever, allergies, flu, covid, 

not even sneezing sore throat used get every year, year lockdown worked healthwise know this?? science field another college psuedo intellectual? staring barrel *NINETY* 9/11’s we’re March. Trump utter lack leadership. refusal buy vaccines. remember unprecedented tragedy like enough stir Americans action, something horrible happened society last 20 years.  posted thing! author article OP trying push narrative. think need open link incognito news article sites show paywall Fire undergrad nursing. Linkedin guess u missed multi-country aspect research. use 1 tablespoon per 1 pint solution. Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler, whose husband owns ICE NYSE, sold stock January secret briefing. watched vote voted mention reasoning (lack data 16-17 age range). US, Trump admin purchased another 100 million doses Moderna, expect ready June, yeah, late Spring/Summer/early Fall non-critical group folks expect available, year half trial data *mass* scale. Outside multi-year effects (which can't imagine worse catching virus itself) we're going know everything know vaccines then. Thanks Pfizer thanks FDA I’ve WFH shopping home since March. Still half tank gas. .... well, 606,000 people die every year US alone Cancer can’t god damn thing it... makes think Covid different. It’s stage Ah guess. frustrating. third article site cites argues implementing lockdowns sooner. article trash, author article biased moron look profile. OP who's posting trash (just look comment/post) history answer -it’s hard. Countries done next cases  Since two-dose vaccine, divide numbers article two know many people get month? mean cool they're close comparison. Thats exactly wrote. choose lose job. business owners affected lockdowns lose income word issue. clorox wipes wasteful. buy spray wipe reusuable cloth. sending us accept decline emails 😂 Really...?

Or weather? False attribution MANY cases. Deceptive articles..

Understand People mostly respond incentives, there's real tangible incentive lockdowns, resisted almost immediately. fair business owners, lot get relief, unemployment denied many workers, long-term solution presented, riots protests BLM exacerbated resentment. 

Right cases exploding hitting home everyone know, starving death eviction next best options, course lockdown resisted. Lock-downs seem worked fairly well Australia New Zealand far see, perhaps work Southern Hemisphere..... read one articles. 

**It fact states exact opposite title.**

I'm nurse I'm going wait see happens 1st 2nd 3rd people take vaccine. Eventually I'm taking vaccine 3 4 years today. 

What vaccine work 🤔 

Fuck trump bully let scientists take time, vaccine rushed opinion. Yet, U trust scientists science. study UV-Index...UV virus think Nope won't. dead body. Doesn’t matter reason.

Businessman Trump tv 3 weeks ago bragging businessman smart could get 100,000,000 doses Christmas.

Not 40,000,000 complete failure, even buys put together aren’t enough inoculate population.

Meanwhile Australia actually Trump said going do. weather...(almost) nothing lockdown....but simple hot/cold... Herd immunity without vaccine fantasy built thousands corpses. follow asking isn’t bush president photo meme mission accomplished take I’ve heard:

The liberal side mistrust government agencies due pressure “make vaccine happen” President. target election obviously missed, sentiment there. 

The conservative side mistrust it’s unproven “new”, don’t grasp concept we’ve years research rolled year timeframe get done. 

The others - well, mind control government tracker chips seem top concerns. simplest terms: 

The vaccine fool proof everyone, need wait enough people vaccine. 

Your friend may vaccine may 5% work. hug him. company helps sell exhibits sponsorships several association tradeshows. It’s roller coaster. We’re seeing thing, I’m sick trying gamify everything trick attendees visiting virtual exhibit halls. Doesn’t make sense kinds conferences run, it’s quality networking anyway. really scary. handful extended family extended friends older really fat likely die covid. great-aunt like 93 head breast cancer twice broke hip last year. gets covid g-o-n-e. Love subreddit like negative news, obviously post great news! Yep. Got temporarily banned sub automod days ago literally cut sentence fit narrative dude. 

However, full lockdowns (RR=2.47: 95%CI: 1.08–5.64) reduced country vulnerability biological threats (i.e. high scores global health security scale risk environment) (RR=1.55; 95%CI: 1.13–2.12) significantly associated increased patient recovery rates.

But go ahead... keep manipulating information continue anti-lockdown narrative. see comment history, post biased 'news' sources exactly now. [CDC link get wrong, US sucking dirty ass. much different elsewhere despite typically awful way Americans behaving. main complaint continue much *worse could have*, rather ranking compared others. doubt infrastructure, resources, knowledge set excellent example, lately decided blow everything rational reason. [This](http://spacanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fur-farms-1.jpg) canadian mink farms [look gross overcrowded conditions, probably better culling like denmark done I’ve reputable high ranked hospital, among best country, outbreak amongst patients staff last months.. even then, nurses cared refused wear proper PPE, breaking protocols coworkers hospital espoused. Nurses whole sacrificing lot right it’s fucked, beliefs aren’t infallible CDC director this, allegedly? IFR estimated .5% .6%, also locally higher treatment available. Hey, 👋🏻 Forcing?
No one going force vaccinate something body want I'm anti vax person either, I'm sketchy vaccine. Good luck you. Yeah, taking vaccine place continually gives world airborne viruses many americans died 2020 compared 2019. thats real metric  Duplicate post I'm afraid dying cause death rate low. I'm afraid long term chronic effects Nah. believe it. made mistake giving benefit doubt first time around never again. People stupid safe then? Unfortunately rise evangelical right past 50 years given Christians bad name anyone pays enough attention politics. really answer sort part group goes deep end still like core element want associated anymore.

Example; still play video games want called ""gamer"" given fucked lot young men gaming community are. sure, like video games lump *those* people. reporting lab results showing Covid December outside china. 

Sure, happen I'll convinced (most reports far actually weak, Italian one far virus capable silent spread without causing much social havoc many months

That, actually remains demonstrated... 

There another meta-issue: covid-in-its-current-form originated Europe, initial outbreak pattern would different... is, first large outbreak Wuhan later outbreaks traceable Wuhan..

TBH, way escape would assume early form virus less contagious/less severe... I'll try find latet. think big bias atheists much like, say, vegans (""how know person vegan? They'll tell again"") lots folks really broadcast it. gotta stop milestones bro. killing us here... literally hate make point, Brazil US providing excellent vaccine trial data. 

If get large cohort 10,000 subjects, 5k placebo, 5k vaccine, wait see many develop Covid-19, wait time able establish statistically significant effect much lower active outbreaks. useless moniker fits, wear it. Excess deaths 310k five weeks ago, that's probably going right. also helps every government solely concerned funding Moronic - update NY far worse quote told everyone wear mask Holy delusions grandeur Batman. next battle FORCING people immunized infect others, selfish fucking anti Vax ass. Fucking force them. google “covid stats nyc” see lockdown worked june september, problem lockdown people don’t follow it, 17 9/11 happened. entering senior year high school. I'm 36 now. wife first kid March. 

It seems milestones life linked tragedy. imagine long term effects?

The ""It's ok old people dying"" people taking seriously, Finally, study also revealed changes long-lasting throughout organs mice COVID-19. addition temporarily altering genes turned cells, virus made epigenetic changes -- chemical alterations structure DNA cause lasting effects. Deb said could explain why, people COVID-19, symptoms persist weeks months bodies rid virus. 

And that's seriously dangerous. 

I wish people would follow rules reduce death rate well. knows people susceptible diseases future. 820 deaths per capita  
 
    
That sounds extremely serious senate vote Canadian Texas contagious virus 2019 killed 300 thousand counting really bad trying obtuse? say, target demographic desperate people make bad decisions money. totally get that. already thought people sucked, made want around literally anyone aside husband son. even exaggerating. can’t unlearn terrible everyone around is. don’t understand people want done masks start social again? really don’t understand it? enjoying current situation? I’m pretty sure *everyone* wants things go back this. around 90,000 dead month three months? Fuck. Depends age. I've ever influenza, know sure. Never got tested. got vaccine moved life, much like I'll covid. Oh one's treat. Several studies show little correlation government restrictions lower COVID mortality rates.

Lockdowns necessary contact tracing quarantines become impossible due widespread community transmission. intention prevent healthcare collapse limiting infection.

This article dates back 27 March  Preach.

We governor takes pandemic seriously literally tells opponents mask they're still alive 2 years vote him, long stay healthy now! love Walz.

..But we're surrounded cluster biggest idiot states took precautions whatsoever we're still middle nation's hotspot. 🤦🏻 true eventually ship turns. Old news hospitalizations due serious life threatening symptoms, testing. Hospitals full. People vaccine nine months now. know. numerous us governors issued stay-at-home orders found breaking orders. Idiots Well thankfully others vote like country would screwed already is. don’t imagine anything. That's awesome!!! Fuck. Damn remember Germany way us (The Netherlands) requiring masks stores stuff. waiting see many americans die get paralyzed sterilized it. ""Daddy, Santa vaccine can't go near mall?""

No good deed goes unpunished. really? First would tell us ACTUALLY immunity vaccine, 2nd, tell us immunity know certainty well. Unless track immunity status, COVID continue take toll years come. one done deal COVID vaccine curious - UK showed footage patients inside hospitals UK Italy. 

It showed people ICU. obviously blurred peoples faces remember horrified nonetheless. 

Are US showing footage all?? Bla bla bla fear circle jerk, go fuck wierdos r/thathappened KCDC investigates transmission circumstances, cluster details published local press quite frequently.

In Germany, luxury, us, infection rates half sentence government, like ""we reduce transmissions close retail"" recently.

I can't take granted without hard numbers, often wrong past.

What public picture virus transmission? shame Trump approve preorder back May. say average deaths per day 9/11. always lower Sunday Monday. denial.

1) update quotes everyone you’ve “cited”

2) hamster study

3) Cambridge study showed reduction spread among clinical staff universal masking went effect.

4) outbreaks sea since universal masking carriers

5) meat packing plants move near zero symptomatic cases since moving universal masking

6) recent study “masks” breaking particles found one mask type that, gaitor, rest masks proved varying degrees success, include surgical masks nearly effective N95’s

Again, completely dishonest approach, you’re bot, nut job. Spanish flu least 5x deadlier Covid, mind boggling think about. Like 2.5-5% world died it.

^/s Great read...

im sure ive covid March UK testing unless got hospital , shortly swelling balls, Dr thought Varicocele eased came back ten fold last week, started antibiotics yesterday. 

To read today timing.... Read comment replying again. one person, 100 people; two orders magnitude greater. talking disease? Middle aged female good shape I’ve got greater 99.9% surviving? Bring on.

The vaccine study wrapped mid November. hasn’t even *time* follow people see long term effects. Oh minority? 85% rest subjects white biologically things don’t always react races. tested negative, Taiwan halfway quarantine trusting hack named Tegnell. Exactly. Commercials thank yous empty.

Every time hear someone want thank health care workers, think takes stay stop gathering wear damn mask.

If selfish thank yous mean nothing. 😂😂I know feeling may bit commentary things beyond covid, could venture theory case much US western countries: 

America place largely supports, values, operates community. could insular communities networks, real national thing. think it’s really existed country times war, even kinda played point.

You physically see national policies. federal government provide comprehensive relief package people smaller businesses. solid message “stay home, we’ll get it”.

Though would helped, wouldn’t stop assholes going unsafe, it’s latest example policies reinforce “rugged individualism” persona. double edged sword covid fatal. won’t act community, “I care myself, think it’s dangerous person, won’t change behavior”. Quotes cuz I’m guessing we’ve heard something similar local asshole. USA 350K deaths January 1st.

By february 1st 500.000 deaths flaw stupid. review going ensure safety efficacy. idiot asked ignore review accept whatever company said. $280 week much qualify Medicaid? Holy fuck garbage country. pressure 🤷 Far people wearing masks world cases still surging. Masks never anything crippled stopgap solution. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, earliest either. expect cases come light. Germany kind like never explosion kind situation. Whereas America persistently crazy high. Definitely. Theres gotta acres cold storage space cold storage containers there. I've met many conferences vendor training classes. get misinformation flair here? one dumbest comments I’ve ever seen may mistaken, believe peer review showed first dose 50% effective second brought 95%. Nonsense. Sweden passing law mandate lockdowns. Looks like Constitution like excuse-makers pretended. thought April. realize much faster. Christmas parties New Years parties coming Think worst dude add hitler discuss little detail Struggle Existence -Darwin oh! ah! amazing “Died natural causes,” even though COVID-19 months ago.

Delete post. still carry spread covid even vaccinated (and worked you)? skip 2 years anti-vaxer controversy move without them? don’t want revisit stupidity every day It’ll take 15 days slow spread amirite? need look 7 day average since weekend deaths aren’t reported days later lot places.  Germany Spain Europe soon Ohio Europe level ICU patients.  point even reporting able keep up. We'll seeing deaths reported February happened January busy January trying catch December's reporting. also hundreds people already infected covid got shot.

It also takes like month work. There's going ton people understand go party days first dose get sick. one go waitlisted California? options it? Pfizer created Viagra, im sure thats hes getting live NJ, pharma capital world, guess we’re good hands then. Either way hospitalizations deaths going plummet point soon beginning process that's start wrapping mRNA vaccines existed since April. understand proper trials necessary. also hope health agencies learn something next time. cost ensuring ""safety"" vaccine around half million people US alone versus simply releasing right away vulnerable groups. price higher heavily botched vaccine could inflicted. i'm sure answer within bounds rules It'll make difference world thousands die unnecessarily.  now, ‘worst’ man? That’s point article missing, politicians aren’t taking away everyone’s right work, taking away chance giving anyone dime money pay system. 

They want work don’t care die. want sure job can’t sued though. places closing hospital systems brink costing much more. happened? Right, subjective reporting scale couldn’t possibly research validated tool. Maybe put everyone fMRI brain scans see what’s really going bodies then. worked like that. government state reserves though. Well true, yeah aren’t getting extra batches reality won’t need them. can’t stress much non-issue is. 

Also can’t say conclusively say candidates “inferior” don’t even trial data yet? Uhhhh makes black ass even suspicious. *When doubt, know way out* barely top 3K day. won’t jump 2K per day overnight. also ignores weekend numbers always lower attributes high weekday numbers deaths weekends reported later week. doesn’t sound like antivax.. Ohh, yes Norcal definitely much consistent job. I'm Los Angeles, city government really bad job putting unified message. 13,700 Cases L.A. county today yet retail businesses still open. Meltdown quite strong. countries getting better, many month Yep. “We low masks please put scarf face” needed say. Instead world learned health authorities lie.   agree last 6 years average .01% increase death percentage per year. .664% .712%. .66,.67,.68,.69,.70,.71

Then year. .9% increase. isnt statistically insignificant. Thats 9X increase last 6 years! we're hitting deaths December. favorite thing Reddit people incapable understanding jokes idiotic need feel smarter people.

Yes, twat, legitimately stopped reading, began type reply, went back checked rest sentence and, rather simply deleting half-written post, continued it.

You absolute genius. understanding, allergy risks mRNA vaccines (which Pfizer acknowledged). Personally undiscovered allergy know actually suffered it. Another possibility antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) problem coronavirus vaccines caused disease outcomes worsen.

So I'm hoping attenuated inactivated vaccine, less risky due similar real virus terms immune response (due presented entire virus) reducing possibility allergy ADE. you’re suggesting everyone stay home can’t afford get sick whether simply due money would lose, lack healthcare disease damage/kill people continue eat indoors.

I’d say you’re going wear mask, stay home rest us leave houses little bit comfort actually end yea, please go half capacity restaurant server hating making half everyone “staying home they’re scared”. He'll surely explain 7 trillion dollars 600,000 deaths Day 1. illegals! 
  
 /s fair point. blame us? honestly expect Americans care others, environment etc? Even simple thing using cleaning rags something expect Americans change. think could completely prevented national level? Break how, im interested. figured referencing. left part Bells Palsy happening rate 25-35 people per 100,000 year US. 

The incidents Pfizer program fall within margin normal

Edit: forgot word  Yup rate we'll get vaccine time 2022. Politicians didn’t create pandemic. Incompetent politicians lost control it. really financially astute...

The consensus I've heard advice generally good people trying get high interest debt, problem spare cash invest, investment advice garbage. cares /s American zombies can't run countries. Person fetish here, would definitely increase amount hit flight attendants. 

Thankfully, plans fly anywhere anytime soon. I’m sorry think April magic happen normality thing it’s big doubt. Even vaccine there’s still whole globe needs done...

Normality knew it? I’m sticking guns fall/autumn 2021 people year. stood science righteousness, got silence incompetence governments Regardless that's true, still no-cost opportunity secure happen. wait use one inferior options. Ummm lol quite bit lag. Like 1-2 seconds, makes whole conversation weird struggle. always wanted that! fun! It’d liable, doctors, would unethical use position trust give advice knowing full well don’t training/knowledge support it. Mask “mandates” don’t work (because person charge US government constantly disparaged use actively encourages people violate state guideline). Could slow reporting staying home worth saving lives thousands people? 
We total lockdown 4 months I'd gladly prevent families losing loved ones. see priorities lie. mma gyms jiujitsu open everywhere else? actually science behind 6 foot recommendation. applied thought virus spread droplets. idea droplet would hit floor would reach face distance 6 feet. Like everything life, reality complicated evidence came pouring virus least partially airborne. traditionally airborne like measles. could hang airspaces build take ride across room right conditions. 

The sad part people like parents think safe visit friends stay 6 feet away. I’ve told numerous times means nothing yet decided believe convenient them. It’s going way 3 mill week. first week. means people death’s door get sent home hope don’t get worse. means think you’re guaranteed die deny transfer rural health center doesn’t ICU. means nurse patient ratio goes way high may die nurse couldn’t get time check vitals. means otherwise treatable illnesses like heart attacks appendicitis may mean death. 

All one degree another possible, people ground know. I’m picturing fedora-wearing neck beard educating m’lady metrics testing vaccine probably already knows about, because, she’s health field. Vaccine side effects pretty immediate. like get vaccine years later autism cancer whatever antivaxxers spouting. something goes wrong, usually happens within 6 weeks, subjects followed least 8 weeks longer Might even catch rate suicides. I'm sorry. four year old hard feel disappointing them. Fortunately, tend forgiving, attached tradition. Maybe year ""unbirthday"" later, special day you. essential workers come in. men women load trucks, fly, drive deliver. pharmacists, nurses, techs come take there. don’t ever forget housekeeping! site named rational ground almost guaranteed grounded rational thinking. fault. one knew already circulating 2019. many pre-existing conditions? /s (and politicians) saying even best case scenario take year vaccinate enough people (the e vaccines produced need two doses 60% population, worldwide that's 9 billion doses). 
And year point many people like ""we vaccinated risk groups, need masks distance etc anymore let's hit club"" lead massive amount infections young healthy many death (even rate death 50 year olds like 0.3% infect enough people bodies pile up...) Unfortunately yes. groups FB nothing vaccines anything closely related. Yet, keep seeing comments 5G, Bill Gates causing virus. Many millions claim tRump made possible No, really can't fix stupid / IDGAF attitude people have, article: 
 Jackson, **registered nurse**, said husband took half-hour drive Los Angeles Manhattan Beach eat lunch outdoors — something longer near love eat outside,” said. “A lot people would like go staying home time.** It’s individual decision.”** 
 
And that's someone really know better. limited legal tools used. example, public gatherings *has* limited law 8 persons, unprecedented move. Exactly done exactly clear legal praxis, severe limitations constitution. Stay home orders would likely *not* possible.

With tthat said, neither experts Swedish constitution rule law. Maybe better leave one lawyers? Show study long term effects (1 - 5 years) I'll gladly take it. amazingly helpful. Thank you!! share far wide Lol wonder chuckled someone said pessimism bias.. could relate.. thanks depression. Lol. might shoes dmv. isnt one germany issues with, started issuing dont use warnings adverse reactions people alergeys Eight days row without local transmission nationally. Much higher periods without local transmission many states. 

Nothing wrong taking care bandwidth noticed initial onslaught Nyc news? Geez ambulances stopping, hospitals full huge amount people seem died. Shhhhh. sounds like context. like here. person scam people living care people safety, picture surprised. Anyone knew China landed moon, collected rocks, first autonomous docking around another body bringing sample back?

Likely not. always find space science engineering good place go convince people doubtful since medicine tricky involves things people can't see understand people often think know bodies well.

China excellent science done. poor students work inhumane hours early age, many, many students, surprised start becoming leaders many science engineering fields. lot people don’t Thank sharing that.  30 - 90 days u mentioned based info got much earlier year ago, sounds like testing shown immunity last longer.  

The 5 - 7 months immunity line anecdotes family coworker.  Luckily gotten covid myself. many people businesses stupid. brother’s workplace, work-from-home pandemic, mandated everyone come office next week Christmas luncheon. Stupidest thing I’ve heard happening long time. ~99% survival rate It’s safe say won’t die unless 70+ co morbidities, right? Doubt it.

This thing ain't measles. efficacy numbers first batch outstanding. drag future.

And plenty ~50% hesitant quickly change mind tens millions country alone vaccinated. I’m glad posted literally days ago everyone saying thread subreddit people die Covid they’re fat. seen people Facebook really discuss 5G Bill Gates poisoning them. 

I can’t imagine goes people’s minds believe crap tbh. scares think people consuming social media way they’ll believe whatever told small bubbles. grandparents assured wear masks conversation told going state 5 days, eat restaurants frequently, go gym walk ""can't sit basement."" Grandma called last night say back sounded pretty awful, definitely congested and/or sore throat cough talked 5 minutes. bring though she'll blame allergies.

I accepted months ago I'll probably lose one this, I'm pretty sure I'm one family taking serious. cancer, grandma diabetic heart attack, plus lung spontaneously collapse least once. Pointing mask (ha!) flaws standard Narcissism. license says I'm inch taller too! like think alow successful life crime.

Gas station attendant : "" guy robbed us 5'11"" shooting hot sauce penis.""

Police detective : "" darn... thought narrowed spicy_ejaculate, license says 6 foot... investigation continues..."" anecdotal city doubled numbers Wednesday Thursday another third Friday... There's 825k jump Turkey: , explains worldwide bump, know cause spike there.  trying equate social life someone's actual life? saying certain age someone's life worth anything anymore?

I brother low functioning autism. life value you? authorities balls that. We’ve known early it’s airborne. facts ever off? Hijacking comment say even vaccinated still need wear mask. vaccine works, though get sick, virus still multiply nasal cavity spread though sneezing, breathing, etc. I've got imagine living rich western country, already trial going useful trial, right?

[I grabbed one near 71 day window start getting useful that's excluding in-processing time. long take volunteering jab #1? Total guess here, 30+ days evaluate health rest?

3-4 months unlikely still seeing case numbers vaccine rolls out. might, granted, imagine trial studies turning away countries like US, Canada, or, Germany going race first batch vaccines verify efficacy case rates become low. question: far deaths data produced mainly hospitals.  

when people able find bed anymore they'll die home, dealt? mean, get counted covid death? get counted dead covid? i'm saying is, come point see number deaths stabilizing hospitals capacity death surge uncounted stats? Bull shit . sure vaccine thinking Pfizer’s vaccine shows equal efficacy across age groups That's shame - one reasons love Reddit exposure non-American points view. fda looks raw data analyzes it. Everyone else trusting company get analysis right. (with varying legal penalties don't, blind trust) 

The fda considered gold standard, expect lot countries approve near future.   trust shady pharmaceutical companies going make billions vaccine horrible side effects legally held liable? 

HOW DARE YOU, IGNORANT ANTI-VAXXER!!!!!!! son born March 13th year. allowed visitors hospital 12pm cut guests. He’s almost 9 months Fear mongering precisely? making confident claims data for. Dead giveaway they’ve never basement, let alone Japan. It’s justifying continued hermitage going approved today anyways ""just Trump theater"", earth would ""second thoughts"" vaccine?

Your mask slipping. nurse must retarded. province? Ab? On? depend age, matter ignorant not. whole family got mother father, got mostly okay. Temperature mother father rised 40 day, thankfully recovered well. sorry lost year. Losing loved ones always hard, losing opportunity witness major life event must feel especially painful unfair. good friend. goes away people without lasting effects. (Had years ago.) Also occurred normal rate vaccinated group (proportional many get Bell's anyway, 1 8000 people per year. nothing vaccination. There’s meeting 12/17 timeline works Pfizer get EUA 12/18. 

Realistically two vaccines pushed Christmas Wake up, please research, one article found reading comments Gotcha. Yeah, peolpe say ""well, Japanese peolpe masks time"". No, really don't. mean do, small percentage thier population. Lots rural areas rely sending complex cases, especially bad injuries major hospitals city. Stabilize toss chopper.

That won’t option soon likely. NYC 9/11 dealt smoldering rubble stinking everything still burning month after. saw people crying covered soot. fun time. death toll continues equal 9/11 everyday seems fair me. Hope enjoyed bike ride figure get home subways shut down. watching history end eyes friends. I’m actually around 6’2. license says 6’3 don’t think am. 

I want push narrative anything 6’4 short kicks. Lol. think 68 years old...and Mexican boot. Trump wants keep people like out. Shows idiot is. Woooow, Youtube proofs. afraid reptiloids punish revealing secret data? According ICU NP friend, anecdotally, already seeing increase cancer deaths younger people. in, people put going doctor have. simple enough machinery, raw material, knowledgeable staff. 

Could elaborate this? sharp cutoff, what? posssible learn potential long term effects new kind vaccine new virus Felt sad last night. went pick something nearby Pharmacy located small strip restaurants. Saw restaurants closed good. 

I can’t imagine many close time ends, happen livelihood families close businesses. Stop spreading misinformation. incidence Bell's palsy -in case temporary- 1 8000 per year general population, found rate vaccinated people.  
 
It would actually remarkable significantly less vaccinated people. It’s mentioned it’s non story. FDA expected make decision today, regardless administration said. 

This way administration say “See, approved told to, you’re welcome”

It’s another ploy certain someone take credit something didn’t involve him. Thursday advisory committee meeting. Friday approval. Assuming course nothing important hiding data, know Tuesday. truly hate argument. don’t estimate ‘actual’ cases disease. say xxx cases breast cancer year diagnosed. don’t pretemd 50% cases undiagnosed make survival rate look better. Possibly died never diagnosed would counted cancer death isnt baseline start with. 

We don’t even say yyy cases flu ‘but likely estimates put us zzz’. yyy cases diagnosed flu probably bunch people never go dr. don’t get counted yearly tallies. don’t get counted death rate flu. agree, faux fur good. fur coats fashion anyways. 
But agree fuck Canada goose  Great. Clickbait make deniers feel good poor decisions. Username checks ...? US government opportunity prepay another batch Pfizer back noone evidence effectiveness, - effectiveness numbers told line goes June July.

You need econ terminology, simple enough machinery, raw material, knowledgeable staff. They'll expand fast later next year abundance vaccines, takes while. pretty much sums felt me, except you’re sleepy you’re fucking exhausted. option nothing pass three main groups:

**Group 1 - AntiVaxxers:** people vaccines pandemic believe kinds conspiracies. group maskers anti lockdown. group responsible serious rise cases around world. question countries followed science emotions, would lot less cases now. countries fine. 

**Group 2 - take vaccine soon offered them:** Obviously group concern.

**Group 3 - Hesitant towards taking vaccine:** people conspiracy theorists. part support mask wearing understand lockdowns benefit area. take vaccines never think twice protecting lives children giving vaccines well. 

However, hesitant take covid vaccine new enough people took it, that's all. line minute lot people taken massive reports problems.

I know true number group. However, recently poll published NY firefighters showed half said would refuse vaccine. ""Many FDNY members said needed information taking vaccine."" right serious crossroad turn many people group conspiracy theorists. address now, complete disaster hands. Conspiracy theorists mess things rest society last thing need them. 

If continue popular narrative vaccines guaranteed harmless perfect, bound big problem month now.

There doubt give 10 million people something, could glass water care, swear illness followed direct result water maybe chemical glass. 

Now imagine vaccine. Give 10 million people horror stories spread like wildfire even without evidence anything vaccine. 

Consider fast news spread vaccine trial participant Brazil died. lab able tell everyone person part placebo group, news pretty much everywhere. Right sub new post every minutes almost day. 

**How prepare?** 

**Step 1:** 100% honest upfront. Tell people using forms media complications happened bound happen far none life threatening. Tell symptoms minority experienced explain symptoms might appear people. Remind specific groups take (pregnant, allergies etc.) make sure doctors remind people giving shot. 

**Step 2:** Tell people expect horror stories verified. stories include people claiming gotten terminally ill family member die vaccine. illness could true could death, imply vaccine caused it. Using Brazil placebo example could really show people quickly fake news related vaccine could spread. 

You know scary part is? 10 million people one reports horror story (even confirmed linked taking vaccine) enough scare lot people already group 3 hold long possible taking it. many reports, anti lockdown protests turn anti vaccine protests. thank  title seems exactly article about. sure get govt selling vaccine way title written. would make sense. Moderna insane requirements Biontech probably requiring 100% sure vaccines stored months. likely normal freezer even fridge would fine weeks going store long time. stores enforce mask policy better cops do.  Someone work lost mother, assisted living facility due dementia, covid. told us family told roughly 90% folks facility covid positive. sick days, can't even imagine many people going losing elderly loved ones. poor people pretty much sitting ducks facilities fucking awful urgent concern them. You’re fucking dweeb Kate That’s weak mindset conclusion. probably talking therapist, you’re already. I'm Pfizer trial. got first dose intake visit, 3-1/2 hours long. Second dose 3 weeks later. it. American agrees. People country suck. know they're unpopular decision hence comment. WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland able administer 3.4 million doses COVID-19 vaccine month, prime minister’s top aide said Saturday, country’s health service gears likely biggest logistical challenge ever.The number daily cases emerging Europe’s largest economy fallen surge October early November, number deaths remained stubbornly high, regularly exceeding 500.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Antigen PCR tests two common \+ full-face NATO threaded respirator. I'm relying brave r/coronavirus members get vaccine first. I'm cowardly unsmart person believes cv19 vaccines rush job unknown risks.

But dopey unsmart brain says soon vaccine deployed, cv19 testing plummet deemed unnecessary obvious effect ""ending"" pandemic.

So I'm stuck hard place vaccine nothing high risk. Either way, first reddit. I'm dopey dumb brain, please save me! That's alot microchips put us track us watch bowel movements /s RemindMe! 40 days enough doses. already saying able produce enough next year, first million doses. need 500 million doses.

Look chart see drastic effect previous vaccines were. dropped cases dramatically... decades. see drastic changes next year, especially considering many doses need. Footage mass graves New York convince them. shit looked like war zone. Imagine thinking stop spread highly infectious airborne disease cloth distance Christmas/New Year wave. Super Bowl Sunday wave. Al least spring warmer weather horizon, though December-January-February death toll truly awful. vaccine can’t come soon enough. thought surface stuff started 45 people March, expanded 120 weeks. Phase III trials, group thousands, started I’m done polite stuff happens me. you’re going parties right now, you’re selfish prick letting know. can’t friends people like anymore. real documentation death tolls? seeing actual change population density large cities many folks dying? Consider fast news spread vaccine trial participant Brazil died. lab able tell everyone person part placebo group, news pretty much everywhere.

A large part vaccine trial Chinese vaccine, Western one. tendency Western media report negatively China. hysteria probably happened Western vaccine. Tell people using forms media complications happened bound happen far none life threatening.

This going led people group 1 move group 3. someone remained relatively healthy last 9 months, would take risk get vaccine now, instead waiting another couple months? think ""determines"" live die. Individual biology, behavior, health, exposure determining. model estimates probability, based factors.

I notice seem hard breakpoints ""age"" factor. Ages 55-64 get one risk coefficient, 65-74 get different value. might nuanced curve could fitted data. suspect 64-year-old person, one day his/her birthday, almost exactly actual risk he/she two days later. (Assuming, course, he/she attend big birthday party.) like pulling sex. Better nothing far foolproof. Pair barrier risk reduced further. Abstain going even protected.  Thank you, science, curing disease God unleashed us. drive car? There’s lot fuck head drivers license unlicensed cause accident. grateful company work came realization summer offices expensive. closed, consolidated, restructured 60+ buildings realized good portion staff capable working remotely. Productivity actually went way up, lay anyone off. employees eventually return offices July That’s like 20 days! people prison proportion population. experience chronically ill (autoimmune disease) vaccine reaction (2020 quadrivalent flu vaccine) much worse expected. strong immune system response flu vaccine caused severe symptoms (extreme body pain, high fever, chills, headache).

.................? yesterday coworkers talking \*employer\* better mandate vaccines employees spring. like, wtf.. get away Rona remember seeing happening Italy thinking: _this anywhere - us_ microchips require 5G, controlled you’re cities time. 

/s important part trial recruitment making trial easy possible take part in.

&amp;#x200B;

I know form testing would required get extremely reliable result, may test invasive administer weekly duration trial. Also, test needs conducted hospital lab, could involve great deal travelling participants. Clinical trial design always balance what's perfect what's possible. wrongthink bad told him. would argue already given assisted care. understand diseases require help all.   would anything wife's parents time comes. Even means, leaving job etc.   watched death process plenty times understand long awful be. RNA shelf life one year stored properly -80 degree celsius freezer. everyone carries -80 degree celsius freezer interesting tools carry operation easy opinion. It’s healthy sit locked indoors like approaching year. Get hike something. Covid isn’t going come falling trees get you. plenty things alone, away people.  health been?

Yes, minority. problem seen USA Europe partial measures / realistic individual precautions work thing winter. Summer, sort hiding sealed air conditioning. Winter, nope.

It either takes degrees personal compliance exist enough people (yes must avoid healthy friends) degrees protective equipment people have. discipline use PPE standards.

That leaves hard shutdowns. ^This Since even mentioned vaccine social media months ago already spreading misinformation. “Bills gates devil, don’t take chip, they’re gonna send shock body take vaccine, it’s also gonna alter dna destroy part brain” initial reaction. little discovery change person's mind. assume cultist would understand concept. pre-hyped mom day hopefully fall stuff. Acknowledged people wary since developed quickly, actually started working mRNA vaccines years ago, that's able modify particular virus start trials asap. one trials issues, personally taking soon able to. Solid health system help course, people also good discipline... Wow, virus comes back lift restrictions, would guessed. It’s EMA. EMA stated won’t approving Pfizer vaccine Dec. 29th, Moderna Jan 12th. Reread comment. great news. waiting Moderna get EUA unblinded. I'm going nice here: get fucking vaccine, wait time next year.

While people might wear masks, going distancing, shutting businesses dumbass refused get vaccine that's available.

You right hold us hostage stupidity. Get vaccine get sick, mitigating think special. even rate death 50 year olds like 0.3%...

Not even close. Recent estimates place [between 0.055% 44, assuming people significant comorbidities prioritized vaccinations, number much, much lower. Already **if 100,000 people age range infected, less 80 expected die.** Yeah aren’t taking away medical advances. Spanish flu spared nobody, young died alarming rate Spanish flu. one select flair list? Can't find UI method either Old New Reddit. won’t wait one shot vaccine, they’ll wait logistics moving Pfizer vaccine homes without risking spoilage sorted out, they’ll wait Moderna vaccine (estimated 85,000 doses coming 2020 Ontario) approved stay fridge 30 days. wrong. I've trying leave adult life problems see America exasperated last years. I'd like think I'm empathetic person genuinely feel bad getting throughly duped thinking country policies best. crazy see lack education lack perspective unravel society mere matter decades. bookings year cancelled mid March, next year looking much better. Imagine thinking smarter/know people dedicate lives carrying kind research. truly baffling amount hubris. system actually sucks. comes deciding debt pay first, recommends using dollar amount deciding factor; interest rate. also preaches credit cards stupidest fucking thing I’ve ever heard since don’t cost dime, actually save money; like Fidelity’s signature Visa gives 2% cash back every purchase annual fee. want save money? Dave Ramsey idiots Since already approved medication, doctors could already start prescribing off-label right? much effect unvaccinated population? assume time next year many 80-100 million US received vaccine (intentionally otherwise), create greater opportunity COVID-19 mutate limit effectiveness vaccine? research model self reports, self reports qualitative data get since actual rater involved giving basic reliability. Reliability caps validity. right basically means Pfizer's research badly flawed.

Pfizers research model partly self reported partly quantified PCR tests medical exams.

All research voluntary therefore biases, get around fact used double blind trials.

This removed much bias possible. clear anybody read report significant differences results 2 groups. already UK approval Europe's regulators [reviewing likely decide soon.

I trust Trump administration means look rest world - anyone good job far. Yeah, sick comparison well completely ignores normal deaths happening, too. People still dying cancers, heart attacks, accidents, etc 3,000 deaths Covid top that. best ignorant statement, worst intentionally disingenuous downplay deaths thousands preventable problem income gap bay area.

I think high time state law limiting income tech jobs. seems fucked say, can't people coming college making 100k year bartenders making 50k plus tips. Three months short think double digit chance sounds right. Anyone know vaccine would require 2 doses per person? know it’s 95% effective that’s really high. Would one dose 80% effective? Also high would allow us double number people receive it. weld people homes

Also clarify, think got turned sinophobic narrative interesting watch.

I'm almost positive actual story sealed secondary exits apartment complexes order better sense people coming going. Also, someone literally welded apartment, think would escape window break walls something. make sense, saw number people occasionally trying correct ""welding homes"" story. closed. government needs provide alternatives. can't condemn someone going grocery store alternative. great advice, people live somewhere without winter :P get mad someone that. Reread comment. got mad someone shaming others things safe. I'm mad people yell others ivory tower. bout sit shut let people go walk park. Social Media cesspool need filter heavily don’t friends it’s okay blinded, randomized placebo controlled, addresses self reported criticism. Damn looks 60 may sign time mRNA vaccines future.

With insane cold storage requirements countries can't establish cold chain, developing world... reason. car accident. latter half matters, first half. EurakaAlert article press release. 

A preprint actual journal article available at: pdf preprint: 

A link calculator given page 17: 

The data R code available download. links also article. new opponent arrived fucked world
Corona:A yes new opponent BATTLE LEGENDARY hard argue someone vested cult personality. widespread reaction given permission ""leader"" movement. criticism leader ideology becomes personal attack, minds, attempt oppress. Without Trump, get reaction. Here's difference - governments countries supported citizens.

In America, people still go work ""essential"" jobs like selling clothing fancy clothing store. Gyms open right pandemic worst.

The people work places risk everyday, come home think ""well I'm already risk anyway, might well go stuff people care about.""

It's obviously flawed mentality, think much easier would stay inside government gave money live without shitty ""essential"" job like countries. that’s left near future J&amp;J

I think probably live west hear chinese vaccines, bunch phase 3. 

Sinopharm TWO phase 3. approved general use UAE. sign get free get appointment. trust china, trust different country also developed high expat population?

CanSinoBio one-shot adenovirus vector vaccine. They're currently testing bunch countries too. 

Indonesia already received sinovac's vaccine. 

Maybe none get mentioned Western news much maybe seems like exist, third world countries getting pfizer moderna. 

 starting pretty disappointed vaccine development turning out.

How? bunch vaccine candidates shown 50% efficacy record time. pfizer moderna 90% effective really happy results oxford released. Plus, FDA needs 50% efficacy approve vaccine here. I'm sick stupid asses like act like everyone goddamn deadbeat something selfish pos basing anything science fact.

Just give cash invest use pay therapy bills. Cases could low people would still use instances like fearmonger. people here, unlike you, see difference cases high vs cases low, see COVID. course, sub us full Americans know difference. 

Again, way stop every single instance COVID spread countries like SK understand can't let perfect enemy good. Global gratitude coming way!

But let’s honest US. didn’t need way. seriously didn’t. took one stupid sinister president ignore intelligence agencies scientists allow viral infection flourish. Green light 98 yellow 99 red 104 non ignorant people You’re bit weird aren’t you. ok? 40 years research, vaccine HIV. least 100 years research, vaccine Cancer. going research, vaccine COMMON COLD. less year vaccine COVID-19?!

But hey reddit experts here. Carry on. looking like CDC meeting vote 50 mins. Vaccine finally start given. True know did.

He's guessing passing fact. Pa passed restrictions indoor dining three weeks places around saying they'll stay open people applauding saying they'll go support dining in. One place know said they're closing indoor dining comply people saying spend money anymore. Got ""slammed"" Facebook youngins say. get it. Good luck everyone! Much love! overestimating scientific literacy average journalist. Kids don’t need vaccine, rarely get serious illness covid. second vaccine widely available I’m done restrictions. vulnerable vaccinated zero reason social distance wear mask like Betty White immortal.  are.

Let's start maybe 30 years we'll probably able find another source cash somewhere ... *cough military budget*. more. many idiots soft hands. doubt it.

REALLY want take chance, least hasten understanding whether safe like... gloss part injecting doubts vaccine kill saves? people get it? Every poll I’ve seen since close beginning virus says 65-70% American people taking virus seriously mitigate exposure. numbers changed.

Maybe lower-level employee basically forced work keep food table. commend also feel sorry you, don’t believe gives right denigrate someone limit exposure virus. Whew. guess people make things up. Oh my. I'm vaccine first. One professors, literally smartest man know. He's led teams hundreds people, 400 letters name. Can't figure use one note uses ms paint lol. dead yet? social media, yeah, that's fun laugh Provide credible source evidence. talking past point, agree everything saying. Again, I'm aware almost everyone gets vaccinated fine, *will* side effects come hundreds millions people get vaccine come 45k trial group, chance, however small is, makes people time average person chance receiving covid vaccines thousands thousands prior examples likely handful true allergic reactions

You're rewording wrote writing like we're disagreeing. Stop. say like Canada somehow immune fucking idiots? Omg, plus holidays, plus angry trump people plus whatever campaign republicans wage murder opponents disease terrorism. Since April I’ve left house week pick medication I’m still terrified. Delivery people still show get grabby face refusing wear mask without sort respect. severe ptsd amd depression kind preferred isolation mow fell like... idk. Like I’m stuck bad dream sleep paralysis actually happens every night. Actually, trump right feels like waking nightmare sleep paralysis. I’m smiling ear ear. I’ve actually somewhat enjoyed solitude. it’d nice know option social, feel urge. Hahahaha. 

""Alright blissfully ignorant""

Critical thinking. Every single person around says take it. ask why, can’t even come proper answer. don’t understand someone wouldn’t get vaccine. Florida can't enforce fine governor order, many ignoring requirements exactly supposed do? Mitch McConnell refuses put legislation Dems passed vote. GOP senate, thus 100% blame here. He’s bound one first line. don’t enough hospital beds every overweight person covid amount deaths already occurring daily clue downvoted. right. related poverty lack resources change fact many comorbidities cancer airborne contagious currently overloading hospitals? I’ve seeing posts night Facebook people urging others take vaccine. lot video posts James Lyons-Weiler talking bad is. It’s frustrating me. mom def going see posts that’s it, won’t get vaccine. She’s heavily influenced things others say doesn’t research it. all. anyone solid retort use kind pseudoscience? took month Melbourne, Australia. Simply due fact people symptomatic long periods time. get police enforce masks shutdowns?

The sheriffs police chiefs area issued official statements arrest anyone enforce distancing orders. friend nurse told horrible stories hospital started working at.

maskless, tests, absolute negligence 90% people alive has. Ask anyone born 1945 WWII impacted personally. heck lot less coronavirus. exactly wife planning doing. shrink wedding bare bones Covid things back normal, we’re throwing MASSIVE Merry New Valentinesgivingsmas Eve party hang everyone wanted wedding. 

More holidays added name necessary. aww dont think so. makes logical sense Good Lord. Melbourne Australian here, worried Covid months. sorry going this. government needs shut everything pay stay home like did. way point. Don’t know you’re getting downvoted, you’re right. every anti Biden commenter pro-trump, sheesh. Fact matter Biden made clear he’s challenge. unenthusiastically voted due reality 2 party system, he’s gonna upset status quo America used wondrous it’s merely ridiculous. I'm sure good number said blokes attend American guys happy bottoms. really don’t think people realize weighted towards oldest people society hospitalizations are. There’s like &lt; 10% population immunized drop hospitalizations ~90%. can't speak entire county, know current hospital two hospitals acquaintances stretched breaking point. We're opening unused space used ICU beds staffing travelers, well offering well time half overtime shifts still barely getting by. 

One big factors covid patient requires ICU level care tend require weeks. That's kills hospital capacity. Also 100% recovered children showed blood markers blood vessel damage post infection. means long term one knows. 52% efficacy anything laugh though. That’s roughly half protection. Obviously adding almost another half top preferred. statistical signals 52%.

Either way couple weeks long Nothing’s stopping developing vaccine making patent free. great. world leaders follow example. current approval includes 16/17 year olds age group included stage 2/3 trials. originally set 18+ 30k participants got bumped 40k 16/17 year olds part additional participants. 9 buildings go today work cleaning. Contact tracing going suck. Thanks info! read viral load first contact affects severity symptoms don’t see info weather affect we’ve already infected. We’re isolating case. saying vaccinating 19-23 days? RemindMe! 2 months Yeah MN. lot friends moms dinner one last hurrah... Fuck. drs still telling weight people go home ride out? fucking cunt, think kids losing parents covid too? Way actually, listened kid talk mother severe symptom's probably going die, fuck you. plot distributed vaccine knew long term effects?

That's identical scenario we're now. Zombies thing cancer sterility are. work grocery store California never shut even really slowed shit, I've able observe day-to-day behavior local area (Stockton/Lodi). People radically change shopping behaviors, part. Initially might've 'spread shopping trips every 2-3 weeks' thinking, kinda stopped summer. People shop like normally do, except masks effort maintain distance.

I assure you, fact lot stores shut first lockdown, people would've gone shopped there, too. whole half-measure business 'reduced capacity' 'outdoor dining' really working. know, see exactly fucking crowded stores get laughable excuse traffic restrictions (my store cap 176 super-busy period long lines 5-6 open checkstands might mean 100 people in-store). went Walmart superstore last week buy gift card, practically elbow-to-elbow checkstands, counting traffic presumably obeying limit.

Outdoor restaurants enclosing outdoor dining using heaters winter, means part point outside negated. They're also still allowed limited interior dining. along lines ""Oh see dangerous vaccine is? 90 year old lady got already dead others already died too, I'm sure going see tons die soon"". opinion strong response, congress bailed country two full months March president given soft order everyone stay home. strong leader would appeal sensibilities common sense rights. Responsible people freedom. Irresponsible people need controlled. 

I’m sure soft, prolonged shut would positive impact knows much point. Nearly every country going another spike. don’t know legitimately control population year wait vaccines.  

I really hoping America would come shining example tackle impossible challenge. Instead, weak leadership ineptitude led us now. don’t think could possibly worse. “a 9/11 every ten days” still used score points?  

Probably. it’s less flashy. tragedy 3,000 people dying single day easy comprehend.  lot colleges using PCR tests. big state ones well small rich private ones. know works America practically anyone come in? Yeah Australia doesn’t that. Good summary, vaccine timelines bit optimistic.. Pfizer show even though 2 doses required, protection starts emerge circa 10 days first shot, amazing, still means 2-3 weeks vaccine really starts biting. 4-5 weeks cases, 6-7 hospitalizations, 8-9 deaths would realistic timeline. still cause optimism, we're almost there. like President something that? Like maybe tell people hunker down, wear mask public, wash hands, skip long distance travel, avoid large gatherings, stay home sick, skip shopping malls, work home option available, skip bingo nights while, order pick dining in, social distance? supposed support stressed areas medical staff, first responders, hospitals, long term care facilities? Isnt supposed direct various government agencies personnel hardest hit areas? supposed console provide comforting words families lost loved ones?

You know, stuff democratically elected leader might country.

Or much ask? Yes, add people virus reports show may immunity lasting 6 months more. Also first 1/3 includes oldest people death rates severe cases plummet alleviating significant portion strain healthcare systems. along told goal flatten curve health care system isn’t overwhelmed.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m super confident back “normal” April, soon enough vaccines available anyone wants one get it, people demand things open back restrictions cease. welcome date resources prove masks working. recent studies show mask breaking large particles finer mist causing moisture particles hang air 6 hours doubt vaccine provides sterilizing immunity. People milder cases possibly still spread it. Anecdotally stores large Mexican cities, big chains etc, require temperature checks entrance strict mask use entering. Far US doing, wonder they're worst off. Even salons take temps. seen Youtube btw. Speaking Australian, I'd gloat subject matter damn shocking saddening. vaccine tested envi masking social distancing already occuring. provable reaches 90%+ efficacy people continue mask socially distance. Fired what? told do? decision made CDC. really shitty one covid wearing mask + social distancing enough? is, I’m part. still go store, travel different states keep time. adjust behavior? quote disgusting consider Christian. Christian's supposed supportive respectful less well them. no, doesn’t. reinfectipns weird cases people screwed immune systems baseline I've heard *thousands* opinions life I'd call willful ignorance... Liberal, conservative, black, white, male, female, tall, short... Literally anyone capable stupidity. definitely ""the team"", matter consider be. mean... car analogy:

The vaccine rushed. talking friend 20 years works viral vaccines - John Hopkins PhD shit. process rushed, ""stacked"". Nothing time based rushed, funding manpower normally would get able stack steps normally would linear. Exactly. Kills people understand statistical occurrences. Someone blind folded ran across highway get ran over, therefore dangerous run across highway blindfolded. Smh 😔 doo doo. There’s rush! Nobody’s going anywhere. makes sense see vaccine’s effect early adopters! Follow simple safety measures, wait! It’s finally coming end. Almost feels weird picture future Covid longer large issue is.   one get it? wasn’t medically rushed.

People cautious handful allergic reactions understanding allergies, particularly clever approach.

There little reason believe someone else’s allergic reaction extrapolated similar risk anyone else.

By time average person chance receiving covid vaccines thousands thousands prior examples likely handful true allergic reactions  Well good way make people see bad situation is, also america cared 9/11 deaths covid deaths reason, using 9/11 deaths trying make people see bad, also covid deniers like patriots shit care alot 9/11 we'll use till understand. Ugh shut fuck already Thank kind others. grew Catholic (now much), outside church always taught anywhere Gods temple created image. don’t understand why, pandemic, people don’t take route. Go worship woods, home, even watch service online want. Instead, moms church inside, singing large groups. It’s prudent. 1 million percent next 60 90 days, we're going really make sure mega-corporations competition. someone already covid, got vaccine...why would want doubly fuck possibility long term effects both?? bunch dated improperly attributed snippets masks. mean, pay get even I'm priority group? Well agree, remarkably wasteful compared testing trial subjects. average moron drama mongerer (arguably case US), responsibility placed news outlet simply potential inferences individuals?

I opinion, curious thought. I’m fleshy fun bridge kinda guy too

hey future grandkids us bills fans never gonna hear end play huh I'm taking risk. Hi friend, much home improvement understanding effectively free everyone.

.most insurance covers preventative vaccinations per ACA. insurance likely cvs groups offer subsidized shots like testing. End day, change much. look projections new cases hospitalization; see Cal getting 15% capacity lockdown within 6 weeks. time, craft new local legislation incorporates dynamics situation there. [There's vivo efficacy golden study found plenty signs immunomodulating effect, signs antiviral action. dose 400umg/kg once. normal dosage EU.

I believe basing claims vitro antiviral effect causing major delays considering ivermectin. least hospitalized patients mode action unlikely work. Even antibody cocktails work well setting. antiviral effect claim makes studies hospitalized patients unbelievable, thus ivm seriously considered. Actually OP reminds dude job got fired earlier year Literally one asked yet tho.  Wow, people here. smell gasoline kinda, \*extremely\* pungent shits, lemons, that's it. tried shining light peehole? underlying health risks though? ""There's pandemic raging 3,000 people dying every day, attending non-essential gathering would pants-on-head retarded"". People honestly take virus seriously enough. extreme risk getting virus. Thanks, really. 

I left job high-risk. exhausting tbh get choice though vaccine want take? Easy distribute, yes. Cheap produce? No, twice price Pfizer per dose. USA went war two countries, one completely unrelated 9/11 attack, hundreds thousands people died it. we're dieing 9/11 per day we're lazy wear masks clueless stay home, save lives friends, colleagues neighbors.

I get people want feel good themselves, I'm honestly sure feel good about. need take long hard look mirror. oh well

fuck santa guess happen. try make sure set sites far past likely date case glitches. would rather surprised mask burn date arriving earlier arriving time. shit  unforeseen all. two people already *known* allergic many things. always allergy prone people response vaccinations, medications etc.. 

Absolutely *not* unexpected. Let’s forget children protected much later. pandemic over. slurpie bootie lets get get coming from, children participated clinical studies chicken pox nasal flu vaccine infants. avenues trials children young give personal consent, theory time data impeding factors, consent. Vaccine Pfizer already out. say best control. control anyone thought possible. said controlled like could. he'll control it. soon see much control. soon. yeo like what? think getting vaccine = free pass go back normal life personally.

The idea community spread reduce near zero, also limit harms reducing severity. Vaccines help accomplish that.

But, green light normal happens community clear outbreaks, personally get shot. Maybe, anything, shot give sense relief risk lowered. F.D.A.’s decision followed extraordinary sequence events Friday morning White House chief staff, Mark Meadows, told F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, consider looking next job didn’t get emergency approval done Friday, according senior administration official spoke condition anonymity authorized discuss matter. Dr. Hahn ordered vaccine regulators agency end day.

This scary. Political overriding process. one rare posts useful, me, new, information. Hypochorous acid nasal filters new things me. Thanks. paper suits, any. full NBC suits, obviously need. go hospital, I'll wear stuff shed wash later. I'm googling now, know HEPA (too big?) viral stopping nasal filter, please let know. Believing Spirit Universe vague ""God"" one thing - believing genocidal nutjob ""God"" christian bible another. never stopping selling guns. moved guns behind counter temporarily shows Walmart good security  said 60 you’re healthy. 

[This CDC says 89.3% hospitalized underlying conditions. Mind article March numbers likely outdated, point almost everyone hospitalized wasn’t perfect health. 

Also it’s good point 0.5% average, people closer 70 would still risk 0.5% people closer 50 would less.

Also yes hospitalization rates bit different death rate gotta fall severely ill die, 10% people falling ill conditions, even less people dying conditions. lets look worst case scenario conditions given, 10% people dying underlying conditions. 

That means you’re 70 underlying conditions I’d say that’s low chance dying, unfortunately severe underlying conditions chance dying probably quite bit higher average mentioned I'm Japan choose virtual person program. love person kids wearing masks, basically chin half time they're always drinking starbucks whatever. Yeah, defeats purpose guys. believe they're safe though, maybe ""temperature checks"".

Point is: people believe want, that's that. placebo group get first go vaccine? Seems like get extra benefit working trial. vaccines probably eventually approved children - Moderna running trial 12-16 something like already.

Children necessarily need vaccinated end pandemic return normal life though.. unlikely we'll eradicate ever, get vaccination levels high enough can't spread widely. July vaccinations

The vaccine continue distributed th following. Dont let Fauci mislead believe public fully vaccinated August. 

Because possibility infecting others vaccinated duration immunity wasnt tested for, current restrictions likely still around 2022. America spends per pupil primary secondary education virtually advanced nations. 

Public schools get plenty funds - waste lot use rest inefficiently. Michael Mina leading charge there. importance tests massive scale. They're accurate, everyone access them, they'll catch enough infectious people tamper community infection. least totally control. Thanks hard work! can't think important job putting red suit kids sit lap get photo taken. literally gonna next year's Halloween costume. recent studies

Stuff posted grandma Facebook qualify study. Yeah, sounds like beforeitsnews something lol. Wow! could prevented. Sorry.

Attitude affect virus.

Things like better testing do.

Let's talk better testing, attitudes. key wear paper suit full face respirator P100 filters. Along that, wear gloves. leave, throw gloves, remove paper suit, spritz hypochlorous acid. Additionally, based available, nasal filters, n95 disposable masks, googles, povidone iodine gargle nasal spray. Lots options wish look hard enough. 30, isolated together gf despite security measures took, brought infection home.

She recovered quickly, keep suffering lot symptoms. infection training lot, relatively healthy, heaving body weight without fat. (I strongman, restricted weight class &lt;105kg)

I struggle since 3 weeks even simple tasks like getting stairs up, reading longer text even finding words. resting pulse 100, constant muscle pain/cramps, headaches barely keep food stomach. least struggle breathing, maybe used swimmer strength sports.

This shit extremely scary honestly worried consequences it, mind constantly feels clouded. (I might able complete master's degree health improve fast)

My lesson: ""low risk"" group behaving careful enough, one time something slips security net. come U.K. approved USA? Yeah looking really bad here. LA Suburb COVID unit expanding almost daily now. initial wave dedicated one five floors separate building COVID. entire building converted COVID ward. lost one patient every day last three days numbers accelerating incomprehensible rate. surge COVID-19 cases Mississippi left intensive care unit beds available across state prompted need restrictions, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said Dobbs said Tweet beginning Tuesday, elective procedures require hospitalization must delayed statewide. Mississippi Department Health also anticipating many hospitalizations increase cases continues. really wish 9/11 used baseline time.  MIL, FIL SIL first round vaccinations (they told days ago, FIL supposedly getting end December!), I’m excited them. Since I’m priority all, schedule says I’ll likely fall March- July vaccinations. I’ve got high hopes, low expectations I’ll get then, fingers crossed! Like hundred different news articles talking many doses can't get June. *Breaks System playlist* exactly asking great comment weeks back explaining rapid development vaccine make less settle fears. terrifying. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Pfizer yet published results scientific journals, give news article important note effectiveness means. results reflect complete so-called sterilizing immunity infection, rather protection COVID-19 illness serious consequences someone infected.

You'll find sources phrase sterilizing immunity. vaccine published scientific journals AstraZeneca/Oxford discuss paper - primary result 70% (62% full dose, 90% half dose) studies (change probability symptomatic infection) , testing asymptomatics too, secondary evidence level sterilizing immunity too, lower. systematic information came UK trial, level quite uncertain. 

This paper know yet - likely sterilizing immunity too. there's also fact asymptomatic spread lower symptomatic/presymptomatic, I'd guess we'll find vaccinated spread uncommon. Yes, WooWoomelons. I'm anti vaccination.

I going rush get particular vaccine. matter anyone says, normal five year processes turned nine month process.

That sort speed/urgency means higher chance mistakes. conspiracy see normal, safe vetting process extremely rushed. 8th March. Woman day. Bucharest. Romania. Less 10 known cases. Public Health Institute employee returns holiday Israel mistress. Upon return buys flowers women colleagues Institute. gives flowers, kisses hugs them. days later feels sick afraid say anything investigation would reveal infidelity. 
9 months later: 545.000+ cases, 13.000+ deaths, 7.000+ cases daily. 
I bet result anyone would expected 9 months holiday mistress We’re quarantining two weeks going in-laws house. six us, us starting quarantining today. I’m hoping goes well. Hopefully, people similarly- small gatherings people took extreme precaution. graph Pfizer data shows vaccinated group clearly diverged control 14 days first shot discernible change that, time second shot. 

The trials deployment schedules really quite conservative. think erred side using much vaccine much effort rather risk possibly getting worse outcome trials.

You could argue best use limited stocks vaccine would single shot many people possible perhaps another round. that's tested can't happen. way. saw Thanksgiving""

""Didn't help, it?"" True hurts feelings almost ALMOST makes care people lost family members COVID. 9/11 tradgedy bro 1.5k deaths 20 years ago 😬😬😬 Yep. brutal. tip iceberg terms preventable deaths ""tolerated"" business go usual. Well I’m school thought people making policies made bad decisions regarding keep business running socially distanced manner. 1. Trump goons downplaying whole pandemic ruined trust scientists researchers. 2. federal govt should’ve collaborated states (especially hard hit) allocate resources experiencing large surges hospitalizations, push mask-wearing campaign. 3. Honestly, stupidity normalized. People spreading lies claiming “I’m entitled [wrong] opinion” completely disregarding established proof studies. 

It’s amalgamation honestly makes furious. much love America opportunities it’s given immigrant, infuriates people “greatest country earth” stupid easily manipulated Literally good thing occurs 2020-2024 100% Biden, whereas everything occurred 2016-2020 good Obama’s doing, everything bad Trump’s. confirmation bias.

As Reddit politically diverse forum due downvotes silencing minority, relatively prone attribution fallacies. think underestimating far willing go paint vaccine dangerous. logical. wife came shift COVID ICU. told conversation vaccine today seemed debate whether would take not. wife finally said ""Well going take watch want see goes""

These front line ICU nurses. Okay 0.9% you’re right that’s closer 1% thought. admit wrong numbers.

That’s still apocalypse scenario though, apocalypse end world, 0.1% people dying isnt aware weed shops 100's people gathered hour together room. Yes....we absolutely close down. Thankfully weed shop follows protocols put place medical professionals relating pandemic. Hallelujah. Yes.  smell like cashews. Turns people thinking like rare. :( Hahahahahaha.

No. 

I manage restaurant NY (about two hours north city we’re still open). employees barely scraping by. It’s absolutely insane “the worlds number one country” absolutely SHIT working class pandemic. guarantee rest states bars restaurants shutdown within week. 

I first admit restaurants shouldn’t open fucking pandemic financial relief 100% needed work. can’t corporate legal immunity covid relief package. diagnose brain rot. cure issue fault policy people. people told go life government, many don’t choice. Save us Joe! FDA approved two-dose vaccine. surprised selfish people are. think messaging masks ""they protect you"" ""they protect others"" reason (and accurate anyway).

What surprised many believe completely dumb shit like 5G causing covid, covid real, microchips vaccines etc. - much would expected.  bet care disruptions though. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn ordered approve vaccine Friday fired. Actually Germany new record. Spain, Italy France 2nd Climax? We're getting started. 0.1% dead. Almost 300.000 official deaths (many, many excess deaths), population 328.000.000. official deaths alone almost 0.1%, excess deaths way past that. I’ve thought well. I’m close grandparents calling weekly years, know I’m minority that. feel terrible lonely elderly people, time too. wanted start volunteering elderly way, I’m sure that’ll happen 🥺 270,000 deaths 3 months.

Sheesh feel like nothing comes cabinet serves build public trust. There's people watching loved ones die every single day rate happened you. get easier disease killed them. war dead Americans. politicians time give single fuck Americans dying ways, surely care 9/11 deaths.

That war ego (How dare attack us?), war profiteering, oil. target demo christians thing following advice biblical Christ like. advice best describe aren’t majority listeners. Almost everyone know follows never really NEEDED help. boys! shit finally over. Wtf buy guns Walmart??  terrified heat disease colon cancer? ""OC: Release violent criminals now!""

5 minutes later...

""OC: Wait, mean release here!"" Lmao care? 3,000 nobodies never met ever meet. Care hell everyone else.  wonder rare, second infection generally way mild, maybe less noticable, since people expecting get tested?

A curiosity mine. We'll learn time.

I'll trust CDC now. matter either way today's choices. Stay in, use precautions need go out, plan get vaccine available. People read article general area live in? I'm near beach areas, barely masks all. stores even let slip without masks.  personally feel like mostly everyone know decided they're done COVID-19. Even people cautious mingling others, neglecting social distancing guidelines, feeling confident they'll fine.

Being someone still takes seriously, I'm treated like I'm obnoxious ""dramatic"". kind hard neglect data create false sense comfort myself. comprehend others it. read article? touch comparisons Germany fared better Italy spite also elderly population. wx name assume know basics, still suggest going someone haven’t!

My best tip stay western Oklahoma generally Southwest better northwest... also better road network.


I miss college chase trips. went gym regular routine, ate healthy support work did, avoided alcohol, worked quality movement patters transfer old age, helped employ coach, keep local owner business, made friends regulars.

All healthy things, replace, owner decided pull plug since know could open again. can't replace situps globo gym.  love attempt explain away seriousness this, like covid patients need bed rest got week. bed bare minimum, need highly specialized care nurses, doctors respiratory therapists. I've said many times, nurses doctors. medical advice coming nurse barely credibility normal person. think Australia skipped flu season covid precautions. Hey, that's birthday one well. time analyze vaccine trials since overworked. idea people reading comment, attempting show easy ways help nurses healthcare professionals see solid aspects trials - since absolutely mission critical getting public confidence needs human society move past pandemic, usually clinical mindset makes easy communicate. nothing grateful incredible work done healthcare workers everywhere. Jared diamond recommendations? love bios interesting ppl Well, simple supply demand. created product literally used everywhere almost anyone computer. He's certainly earned IMO everyone entitled feel differently. Pfizer said *at least* one year. Based well immune cells lasting, likely several years, certain populations may need frequent boosters. Okay like, record without breaking rules around restricting social gatherings? realistic individual precautions work thing winter.

Masks, social distancing, reduced capacities realistic individual precautions work winter, especially masks n95. Everyone able buy many n95 want govt didn’t fail miserably. 
Vaccinated still need wear masks. Records going break daily quite time. 

You're right, vaccine can't come fast enough due manufacturing logistical reasons. what? 

what? Shutting restaurants bars places people take masks important, absolutely contributes spread, gives license people interact households. 

I agree people choosing continue gatherings. Mostly already past. people hanging friends every day likely going stop, probably feel invincible (since covid thus far). see people know super frustrating. Especially surge unlike anything experienced before. annoying make sacrifices others choosing to. nothing finances businesses; know people seeing friends family fun, mostly without precautions (without masks). think death tolls dumb comparisons. Take group nursing homes 1000 old people died. years life lost probably less sandy hook shooting 28 people died. said cheering. see pro against.I’m waiting facts. You’re emotional. You’re getting Covid again.  able things 100% linger. Steve Jobs would argue art school excellent choice.He said useful class took calligraphy Thank you, truly Phew, second thought said USPS ! good rule would . identify Republican.. voted trump.. anti mask...If ever said words * fake news * ALLOWED NEAR HOSPITAL !!   ,DIE DIGNITY TRUMP CULT TRAIN Wow dangerous virus can't even kill 107 year old likely, yes. Pfizer established precedent this. However, *when* actually get vaccine debate, giving placebo group participants soon could confound trial data. Get tested notify contacts. Covid cause changes smell taste due nerve inflammation, congestion like respiratory illnesses, anything selectively diminished smell/taste changes smell/taste reported, uniform. Japan South Korea shown even wide spread mask wearing contact tracing, covid can't completely contained without implementing strict lockdown. risk jinxing myself, sick since February. actually really nice. I’ve definitely experienced three. Especially breath, would different odor fever coming on. God I’m fucking excited. Day 1 return normal US Yeah, used donations pay salaries anger fight!! Good luck  High priority.

They trapped close quarters. Wait, you’re saying GDP per capita used unless total population certain limit? Id say since born country. need citizenship grant thoughts careful posing self-published, poorly researched, purposely mis-titled research internet.

People might think troll something. Everyone talks herd immunity. Isn’t impossible don’t give vaccine young people? There’s 75 million people 18 face masks!  Oh strike certify ama chapter union go strike safety issue

Contact labor lawyer follow profesional advice dont want guy little embarrassing America NEED rely heavily vaccine development instead beating virus ways? get effective way neutralize virus severely rushed makes bit nervous. 

Other countries beating virus social distancing, wearing masks, paid stay home. shown effective neutralizers virus. Unfortunately America, virus polarized politics viruses existence still highly debated issue.

when presented new evidence That’s unrealistically optimistic timeline Narco dogs often trained read handler cues scratch handler wants probable cause search. No, that’s great answer, thanks. I’ll interested watch see Biden takes credit anyone credits Biden administration them. authors offer several possible explanations lower risk observed. include better personal protective equipment better use it, working well-ventilated environments possibilities patients admitted ICU less infectious wards, high risk procedures establishing patient ventilator (including intubation) high risk assumed.

I wonder particular doctors also tend spend less time close proximity patients. maybe time patients sanitize ensure PPP integrity order. visualize busy overloaded medical staff (or taking) time maintain safety thoroughly ideal. agree! probably could gone swimming friend inject testosterone weekly ass. That’s hardest shot give No, enough billionaires fun ignorant left wing schemes.

But could be. drive, resources brains. somehow go rails every 8 years so... that's makes America frustrating credit, always phrase things well wording might confused him. guy bothered people put masks anything. might hard cardio? runs mask fine. Seems like another BS point.

Yeah plan, since Covid, difficult actually get see Dr like answering questions without appointment. guess like office visit fee. It’s actually reverse problem. Case point: virus still numbers live extremely low summer. Many us went kayaking, fishing, beers fire outdoor activities summer. Even covid sensitive friends would come drink porch. it’s cold numbers went people gather inside more. I’ve pretty isolated since early November. don’t think acted summer wrong dangerous sporadic deaths till recently.  People “throwing labels” Christians trying force everybody else believe believe-or live life do. judgmental people. want victims badly. bet, people take masks meeting starts. everyone takes seriously, still. ready that. lump early 30's 18 year olds early 20's going get much lower infection fatality rate (IFR). better IFR us early 30's .05% hype button.

Enforce masks?

Not moving world here, grade homicidal asshole empathy narrative cover. Same. It’s made question whole history couple people, particularly one contracted COVID maskless socializing turd, attended family functions rather isolating. Zero responsibility, zero interest well others, might well join GOP. Hate timeline. snows foot here.  Oh god, damn sorry. feel horrible happened hope pull through. yes, know must feel horrible amazing work her

I hope makes Yes, thank helping clarify!  gym stayed open.

Only ten people allowed one hour, sign names provide contact details, temperature taken enter, observed using hand sanitizer, agree wear masks wipe equipment before/after use, equipment sprayed disinfectant hour next group comes.

Haven’t outbreaks tied facility throughout pandemic. Fitness one things shown increase survival chances helps people‘s mental health suicides related lockdowns went on.

There way keep open take proper precautions, government seems middle ground wasn’t even discussed businesses. gaslighting continues. owner bothered enforce masks. POS maintaining community hotspot political spite.

Save empathy someone deserves it. reason close restaurants. already limited capacity, hardly transmissions traced back restaurants, hospitalizations state high. said, advancements made vaccinations nothing short amazing! One day started run-nin Hmm, think right. Redfield hopes widespread vaccine March, Fauci expects one April. Warp speed head expects us normal full stop May, whole Fauci says could hit “relative normal” April-July. country also effect. everything stayed anything pandemic shown world Americans willing part. fair.. eating taco bell alone non-negligible CFR. Good question. 

[Hinshaw stressed one put risk making dangerously happy-huggy videos. “These ads filmed last month strict protocols protect safety everyone present,” Hinshaw. “The cast crew required follow strict protocols, including screening, off-camera masking distancing times camera wasn’t bit overstatement say one put risk.

He's magical creature, what, need vaccinate Easter bunny unicorns well? Great questions! I'm curious 👍🏻 ever start? Next week earliest. FDA meeting next Thursday. anyone know takes long make vaccine? apologize thats stupid question, im impression ingredients quite hard come mass produce much shit 100's millions. Im hopeful, timeline feels painfully long that's first time I've heard said like that. Love it.  making new records every day Honest question know ask anywhere else.

Why U.S. Government/Military/Warp Speed program handling distribution vaccines?

The news today said companies handing vaccines UPS.

At point maybe cannot take another crazy pill, feel like plan place made distribution nearly instant. Air drops DC-10s, Apache helicopters flying every major hospital America, on.

It really bothers best chance turning tide disaster competition bathrobes hickory farm gift baskets sent country. Thank Biontech. Pfizer one producers. likely Holy shit thick.

Normal corona viruses typically vascular rather respiratory disease. *assumptions* *anecdotes* beer buds totality situation. literally last person would think take advice subject clearly unclear prefer remain willfully ignorant berating people little know compared ass. telling there's something fulfilling pretending reading second monitor many weekly scrums? China risks social unrest cancelling lunar new year holiday, insanely fucking serious. Think opening ""China"" chapter World War Z. Ah yes, 32 years professor PhD microbiology immunology, practically novice... Good see Trump, Senate, House Representatives along rest necessary factors indeed able make FDA expeditious get job done timely manner. Brother seriously need look vaccine works, end solution. end solution takes months even years fully effective till take precautions. Kennedy assassinated ‘60s endgame.  Unfortunately that's really works. Even well educated people form opinions based facts.

The way works this: based upbringing, character traits life experiences, one chooses allegiance various 'tribes'. uncritically adopt viewpoints biases tribes belong to. Education used vet facts form opinions, construct ever elaborate defenses opinions passed tribal chieftains. example - fans sport teams feel wronged unfair referee, match.

Another important dynamic zebra stripe effect. parts tribe's lifestyle - overcompensate remaining lifestyle choices, unambiguously signalling we're affiliated Other. espouses X, hate X; hate Y, love Y. friend hospice nurse. got covid month ago. like, positive person ever could tell scared could die. shook up, I'm already rightfully fearful grocery store monkey. people definitely play significant role, leadership strongly influences people behave view situations. Given obsessed Bush Obama possibility airborne respiratory pandemic occurring, I'm sure US plan top notch, one best world. incomprehensible plans safeguards eliminated quite literally ironic times, comedic irony Start good go things reopen! people didn’t even go war WWII. think saying benefit outweigh risk. effective vaccine supposed be, risks would pretty high vote down. Even younger people less likely symptomatic, vaccination least reduce likelihood asymptomatic carriers reduce duration we're sure long transmit virus (immune response vaccine lead body purging virus faster).

Why risk spreading virus instead mild vaccine reactions? 0 deaths attributed vaccine 44000 test subjects Pfizer trial. Besides training body fight virus, another big benefit vaccines reduced transmission rate. That's achieved body kills virus faster spread much/at all. saying kids benefit vaccine true. Everyone benefits bit whenever anybody vaccinated. Vaccinating kid reduces chance immunocompromised adult can't take vaccines contracting virus

I think votes wanted data 16-18 age group. Basically saying felt enough data make statement either way regarding safety group. 17 members felt enough evidence. Reading Apparently 15 million already assumed it. case counts easily reaching 300k keep end january (49 days). 49 \* 300k = 14.7 million. would mean close 30million would form natural immunity (assuming long term immunity thing). US 300 million people, would mean 10% population it, vaccines started distribution (\~24 million). 54 million would form immunity (natural, vaccine). wonder effect spread. thoughts/feedback? would immediately unfriend person response. time assholes life. real number 30 feet, I'm sure go ""less worse"" distance people might actually follow. holocaust incompetence ego. many positive facts, course downvoted it. comment saw 100% enthusiastic reasonably posing question vaccine testing period, makes question trueness website since subreddits always million opinions, subreddit shows certain type ideology maybe bots? Current trends point 3.5/4k per day, even Thanksgiving surge. can't look bad, account additional measures states like California New York taking combat spread. 

Point is, we're still good ways 400k deaths. I'm saving money now. I'm taking least month work reopen properly. swing ways. 
There's also chance people blame vaccine anything bad happens someome received it. Heart attack? ""It must've vaccine."" Cancer? ""It must've vaccine."" on. 
Derek Lowe talks family combined Thanksgiving/Christmas/my Grandma's 80th birthday party outdoors socially distanced back October cases lower weather still nice. someone explain never ending comparisons covid 9/11? far tell, two aren’t related way “people died,” right? Like 9/11 terrorist attack *people murdered people.* covid naturally occurring pandemic people dying natural causes, right?

I don’t get whole reddit narrative “how come freaked 9/11 covid?!?” Well, because, 9/11 “third party harm” means it’s preventable. Covid pandemic means it’s *not* preventable. it’s preventable, I’m gonna freak there’s nothing it. hospital rolling who's risk exposure. ED ICU nurses providers, RTs nurses working covid floors wave 1. Im saying good scientist. worked EU became state epidemiologist assume reason hired him. Thats used ""maybe"". 

Anyway point post, say isnt good PR/communication. Eh. I'm tired, disappointed many neighbors family complacency. I'm also proud us making far. whole year nuts. bothers people power influence whatever want consequences poor wealth healthcare die alone. opinion weaponized misinformation pandemic. mom antivax stretch word pandemic. got vaccines, vaccines. groups intentionally spreading misinformation, super vulnerable fear tactics. 

Another reason think people arguing getting vaccine issue politicized. People loyal political party. soon politics involved, many people lose ability think logically. amazes willing people roll dice based chance ""most likely"" die. saying that's happened gentleman; virus widespread may everything could,, goes show ""most likely"" inherently means negligible chance die, especially people even 20's. even take account long term issues, study coming showing virtually children catch covid sustain blood vessel damage, cases worse, that's within subset population least susceptible adverse events resulting infection. 

It likely happen flat wrong. Yep. reason believe it’ll end next year. Spring looks likely. worst offenders nurses? know one post multiple 10+ gatherings, mask companies selling everything make governments.

Is right? thought government initially ordered less recommended. 

What's supply curve look like? highly inelastic? 🤔 goddammit you’re right Eh, people place beginning collapse '70s Kennedy's assassination, would mean we're half century collapse accept true. Historically, taken centuries empires collapse start finish, think technology-especially tv social media-has rapidly accelerated process. Honestly, feel like US maybe 30 odd years left collapse more-or-less done finally rebuild (and hopefully build something better).

Point is, climax hit, things tend deteriorate rapid pace. Certainly next year going fun. legitimate question: go backpacking Christmas, risky behavior? People keep saying stay home. time leave go grocery store laundromat, hike. limit hiking something feel guilty about? Struggling reconcile information here.  companies selling everything make governments. illegal per se, there's nowhere private actor would get sell (and government might say anyone private stocks get government stash). Bro

You almost always ignore someone response serious discussion starts like this. think it’s general idiotic reaction lot Americans people amazed by... Anti mask, anti vaccine, voting trump heavily again, stop steal madnesss, general protests excessive thanksgiving travel. guys looking great rest world lately.  “it’ll 9/11 times thousand” Vaccines accomplish herd immunity. distributed natural heed immunity reached. Even infections far, 5-10% population who's infected. good thing? need kind natural selection Luckily Biden came plan well election. Finally politician makes rich pay fair share waited months Shingles vaccine... think helpful announce individual feelings everyone else somehow agreed upon. I'm going get vaccinated ASAP, I'm fine wearing mask distancing pandemic actually over. may take much longer happy about, ditching common sense methods slow spread, random number people vaccinated likely pretty gnarly consequences. vast, VAST majority Australia went lockdown lite 3 months living complete normalcy since June. Americans seen mass death, mass layoffs, return normalcy sight. absolutely condoning behavior like visiting family Thanksgiving, going maskless wherever please. conditions would make even well intentioned person lose hope try find bit misguided normalcy, country (Australia) terrible comparison. future we'll know plan scenario, one could seen coming... would made killing sales foresight hindsight it’s killing. /s readout means we'll able see effective vaccine is. enough apply EUA Interesting piece research. understand numbers able protect family better.

1. healthcare medical workers 
- comorbidities 
2. Essential workers: ( specifically food, transportation, teachers.etc.)
3. People 65 
4. everyone else

again uo stare state seem follow guideline maybe

I dont think priority list considers live family member higher risk you. basing individuals most.

If read correctly bus driver though high nurse/doctor/ hospital etc. “earlier” early 

Again, tricky cause got janitors hospitals Dude, elders *are* high-risk. Move life. guess better people lose lives people lose businesses? think Ayn bad Adolf, wut? Headlines need really start careful. people know everything Covid, believe first place, title reads pandemic next week.

Title said ""limited vaccines could arrive small number patients starting next week"".

There's way many people know heard August vaccines may approved November stopped non-mandatory precautions behavior changes. 

There's gonna ton people who've heard vaccines arriving administered every day Christmas decide go Christmas otherwise have. Oh brainfart. read 154 twice somehow

How many people tested positive twice six months? say? Yeah, sucks situation I’m in, zero sympathy fucks give people aren’t taking precautions COVID-19. legitimately people like cannot first/main wave vaccinations, sometimes forgo vaccine genuine, honest goodness medical reasons (and bullshit antivaxers try peddle).

So truly thank everyone get vaccinated. Well honestly keeping fit fact help, that's really best argument make here. know comments said kind business PPP (and aid) meant help keep doors open, politicians, mega churches, super rich took money line pockets.  We've farting around 9 months people still taking seriously. could done couple months people actually listened taken basic measures protect themselves. transmitted air inhaled. know avoid breathing asbestos fibers chemical fumes. works catch Covid.

What we're seeing result people self-centered inconsiderate ignored warnings wanted Thanksgiving. Australia almost flu season.

Flu reproduction factor (R0) less 2. SARS-CoV-2 R0 4.5 more. Even use lower commonly reported r0 3, it’s much higher.

Mitigation efforts capable suppressing covid simply crush flu respiratory diseases require contact people flu way less infectious. even mean? link got test CVS reading info gave essentially said thing (for nose swab). “Still 254 days 5 months we’ve heard people testing positive longer (6months top head). looked still doesn’t necessarily mean”

254/30 = 8.4 months Fuck that. unfair unreasonable unacceptable idea. social needs gradually supersede need stay safe forever. number COVID cases went pretty hard last months.
I don’t know many people governments ignored that. financial support ~~small businesses.~~ employees lost job.

FTFY agree you, please stop throwing around term gaslighting? People things don’t agree gaslighting. actively trying convince pandemic isn’t real, fine, simply ignoring guidelines isn’t gaslighting. It’s serious term wish people wouldn’t use whenever mean “doing something don’t like”. it, course. /s Shutdowns best public health regardless financial relief.

Honestly, still socialize, outdoors. Health organizations even encouraged people socialization others avoid isolation, long outdoors masks. Freedom movement States constitutional right subject exception necessary health measures. Historically border closure ground rare pandemic provoked closures, may dubious constitutionality, challenge pressed highest court.

As highlighted state borders closing 1919 Spanish Flu folks, seems like recently low risk group, definitely back. things definitely taken consideration anyway, since people may infected quite ago may less protection, least there’s data available. Maybe I’m wrong this, seems like news suggests that

My personal guess would same. Covid, less likely catch again. Much less likely. 100% immune though. got antibodies however much immunity, byproduct use counting many people Covid. immunity ""stored"" T-cells produce loads antibodies quickly, ones floating around blood next meaningless compared that. Actually is. data Pfizer pretty clear infection rates vaccine arm 10 days 20+ days after. second dose definitely necessary see effect. Everything possible, many groups don´t want shops closed christmas ""because economy"" ""to get back normal lives, expect likely 6-7 months now.""

6-7 months vaccine going widely available everybody. actual pandemic however might that, vaccine targeted impact deaths/transmissions much possible choose vaccinate first. 

40 million doses end year huge. 12% entire country, 12% vulnerable people. Even vaccinate 75+ year olds early January (75+ year olds 21 million Americans, realm possibility), would reduce deaths half, DRAMATICALLY lesson burden hospitals. Unless high priority candidate. probably even access vaccine spring anyway. Go good thing! What’s even worse seeing people thought rational intelligent human beings ignore covid advice partake large thanksgivings, traveling Hawaii/South America, partying indoors maskless aware virus CDC guidelines. Yeah, phrased statement bit ambivalently, sorry. =D annoyed journalists wrote headlines ""Antibodylevels dropping, immunity"". asked anybody actual medical knowledge, us would able tell start. serves frighten people needlessly order sell newspapers... No, analogy reaction \*you\* would go restaurant people allergic carrots. paid attention last ten months US always struck diamond-encrusted Deagle wielding great power. think that's going change. first second peaks mostly affected low-income minorities working close quarters living multi-generational households.

This wave's mostly affecting middle class white people gathering Thanksgiving. time come realize that, late. 3 million per week. 330 million americans. take year even reach herd immunity. want well, think problem capacity here. Even speed still take ages. hated driving Oklahoma every time got gas/food hated bearing intense wind. words good luck lol Given area currently availability hospital, expect would able survive, although guaranteed, also want suffer hospital week more.
It's unnecessary risk childish assume everything ok options wearing mask go over, going over, easy. like line grocery store everyone standing moving really easy make Lysol wipes. use Lysol concentrate make solution fills part small container put stack coffee filters soak. Eh, Christian conservative circles still thought nut job. Seems like he's gotten nuttier since. Contact tracing isn’t reliable it’s almost impossible be. much easier trace contacts family gatherings because, guess what, people know other. 

If live normal life, go restaurants supermarkets gym get it, know got it? Unless big spreader restaurant infections places go undetected.

I don’t know NY % unknown source infection places huge. mean 80-90% huge (Germany).

That data highly biased. nefarious reason, it’s way is.

The virus gives one fuck pockets empty ""need work"": it'll kill dead injure *just same*.

THAT SAID - said Iowa Nebraska major factory processing plant outbreaks Spring, bigger risk supply chain issue. half employees sick Covid dead, cannot meet demand, limits supply meat products available consumers. owners less concerned this, realize demand still high, offset deficits jacking price meat, like spring. little downside them, Americans love meat products pay higher prices, even supply increases production end. real incentive keep facilities clean safe employees, consumers pay due demand. 

In fact, recently discovered Iowa dealing factory outbreaks, leadership nothing lessen spread, also made wagers many employees would get sick die. game them, knew decreased supply would hurt revenue. late stage capitalism horrifying, yet unexpected. teach term garnished wages.

If actually looking conversation good faith, try bit tactful future. r/darwinawards expend effort?

Because wearing mask public social distancing tiny effort massive reward, tens thousands people's lives. would make tiny effort prevent spreading illness causing people die?

All 2% Pfizer. Politicians know feel must *do something* even said thing going accomplish anything. Cuomo pandering idiots think stopping covid even possible. uncle physicist would like invite church Key word *almost*.

Its literally headline. mention, lenders look industry going forward? already near impossible make money. Lenders going even wary.
 
Without major assistance, interest free loans, etc restaurant world never was. MUH SIDES administration drove people actually work hospital. large doctors nurses aren’t hard keep happy you’re one places actually cares them. And, noticeable side effects, like fever soreness? first 100 million doses purchased U.S. government, approximately 20 million doses delivered end December 2020 balance delivered first quarter 2021. Today’s new order 100 million doses delivered second quarter 2021.

So 50 million people receive Pfizer vaccine another 100 million get Moderna vaccine. Fingers crossed.

Not one. It’s mRNA based Yes! Fuck vaccine want need it.

My body, choice! What? USA already hit day last fucking week. crossed 911 (total death 1 day) one single fucking day. Great, across Pfizer Moderna, brings us enough doses 150 million people June. 

Now either AstraZeneca (300M doses ordered) **or** single-dose-arm J&amp;J (100M doses ordered) pan out, takes us way number people realistically opt-in get vaccine. think would get it? spina bifida myelomeningocele. home since March. mental health really suffering. No. Social media given opportunity congregate spread do-do brains.  Except people going restaurants also go places like grocery store, workplaces, children go school, etc people “saving themselves” also go. 

Plain simple - people paid stay home nonessential jobs, given “the right work”. Hep B. Took two shots vaccine, waited, titers run year later. Took series again, measured titers again. time low. took single booster shot I've immunity years. Mask use suddenly picks up... unless every state municipality adopted uniform set rules regulations, nobody bother trying? People already freaking 2 people allergy reactions prepare popcorn anti-vaxxers. bigger group ever before. get it, expect federal help states made decision close Unless job, work expose min wage die/starve/end homeless. signed help man vaccination clinic hospital work 🎉 I’m hype! one caveat didn’t track asymptomatic spreaders trials, don’t know people 95% contract virus not, won’t get symptoms. Yes new potentially dangerous virus erupts. anything covid shown quickly drastically things change. learn mistakes avoid global outbreaks.  vp elect Newsome said wouldn’t trust vaccine. They’re partially blame. Yeah, article fucking dumb. way average 5k deaths day next 20 days. 3k - deaths would accelerate far faster happen month. 
 
By Late January? possible people don’t change behavior. Can’t get sick don’t leave home.  Yesterday dumped asymptomatic (but PCR-confirmed) cases onto statistic. Previously ignored them. That's suddenly +800k yesterday, ""only"" 30k actually newly infected cases. hope quickly determine Pfizer vaccine caused reaction people U.K. instead saying “don’t bother history allergic reactions.” 

An estimated .5 - 2% population anaphylactic reaction point. That’s lot people may go without vaccinated. We’re expecting J&amp;J, AZ, Novavax well. could happen daughter's boyfriend's brother, happen anyone. Yep, everyone stopped giving fuck.  Three Million Get Vaccine First Week

Oh thank god. mean like Seniors Home??? Seems like work well first time, second, ... Okay but...girls dicks. know there's fantasy fetishes reality girls can't suffer erectile dysfunction. vaccine wasn’t late. reason millions won’t die US alone. June enough doses 150 million people. Could even Pfizer delivers and/or vaccines approved. Actually, there's not.

If FDA 400 sign-offs approval, first one scientists doctors evaluated safety rest bureaucrats. still licking boots 280 approvals saying ""we know safe 400 middle managers signed off!"" Even disease wiped wild, BSL4 labs retain samples (eg smallpox, etc). Experiments continue ferrets w/e. Unless dinner thousands attendees, odds ""some"" dead coronavirus remote. Yeah reason OP thinks months old article method suggested -but never used - minimizing disease transmission crises relevant here. 

People posting time time months. guess think everyone stupid figure article about.

It doesn’t, many people.

It cuts heart muscle, damages blood vessels, possibly comes permanent neurological effects. relatives going right (an emergency pharmacist RN, watch people struggle die everyday) they're worried long term effects.

No. Optimism bias exists world would see American Covid catastrophe mirrored everywhere blame.

Americans selfish. That's it. acting like virus exist... quite possibly. 

If still continue practice good social distancing mask wearing before, risk change. PPE seems like better use polyester spunlace chlorox wipes Young people priority list vaccinated honestly. They're ones going partying spreading nursing homes (ex: young nurses/hospital employees). Plus, they're usually asymptomatic. thinking. talk safe sex education analogy, since point, can’t stop people getting together, make sure safely. It’s honestly quite frustrating California subs, right basically don’t wanna hear rather confusing. least real life, seems like people understanding rather focused prescriptive shaming like many California subs right now. don’t think shaming going work point, especially since multiple crises relief sight. can’t look things isolation, consider larger context. 

For example, waiters can’t get work may able apply benefits already used available benefits, do? Let’s say go target Walmart spend majority day indoors, close contact customers, even less protections restaurants. instead people work outdoor setting that, perfect, offers greater protection many indoor settings would, force people situations take jobs indoors businesses can’t shut due classification “essential“ (which say seriously sarcastically sense whole, grocery stores essential, given store essential unwilling enforce rules). 

Overall, well think Newsom good job early days even mid summer, think didn’t develop policies based best science data available even though marketed such. lead case rather high also crippled economy leaving people absolutely Safety net whatsoever. don’t envy right now, think he’s isn’t working frankly think he’s lost basically credibility public.  got flying across US Christmas insisting we'd vaccinated next months, wait little longer. parents disgruntled ""wait 3 months"" palatable delay ""sit tight, 2022"" makes people give entirely say ""we live lives!""

I actually expect us vaccinated March, that's fine saved dying January bug picked airport December. honest hospital collapsing cases nowhere send people. sometimes  It’s mess. good month writing, disqualifies me. get much unemployment, disqualifies me.

Edit: forgot mention it’s I’m married disqualifies me. combined income married people qualify lower single. LA (county) cases Canada 1/4 population Well, empirically, he's helped lot people made lot money, that's evidence. 

And follow ideas, extremely hard wind better financially. Now, whether follow ideas, that's question. talks ""baby steps"" really they're baby goals. steps save $1,000, pay debt except house, continue saving six months expenses, invest 15% income retirement, fund college kids, pay house. That's well good, can't decide those. talk budgeting course, get nitty gritty it. also believe reserves strategic purposes. good data, analyst able predict hot spots, possibly determine extra 100k would make impact, so, big impact. situation remains fluid, agile could prevent millions cases. He’s like financial muary povich. lambasts people views. Things change. question going get worse? need to. We're watching burn currently. Let's see rises ashes. LA County alone cases per capita half country makes third California's cases. Nordic model pros cons. Like example, many wealthy would actually flee somewhere like...the US. large, works fairly well Scandinavians among happiest folks planet...at least based global happiness index measurement.

But course, rich folks like higher taxes use scaremonger tactics ensure never comes pass. want honestly thank commenter giving actual laugh otherwise grim winter day US, trying hold onto virility (so far good, damn right I’m staying home!) well sanity also democracy.  still remember reaching 250k feels like days ago. Shits moving fast now. We're adding like 16k deaths week look 7 day moving average average day 2019, 7,778 deaths. always deaths per day 9/11.

But guess still will. forgot reddit coronavirus commandments. Thou shall speak poorly Europe, save types comments US. noticed milestone too. paying attention live NJ. breakthrough every single state plus D.C. (as well Puerto Rico) recorded least one death, first time I've seen happen. I’ve railing nutter years. /r/pf guy bought cult. different muskers trumplets. Wait endanger everyone? take vaccine get sick since took vaccine. Yea, suppose kinda read wrong explain excess deaths(more deaths usual) much higher year. excess deaths actually higher thsn official covid death count likely undercounting slightly Back May FDA put Ivermectin recently released research article described effect ivermectin SARS-CoV-2 laboratory setting. types laboratory studies commonly used early stage drug development. Additional testing needed determine whether ivermectin might appropriate prevent treat coronavirus COVID-19.

The FLCCC since done additional research. Ivermectin safe use. group brought us MATH+ standard care, FLCCC Alliance recently presented I-MASK+ protocol.

They group practicing doctors researchers 2,000 published papers credit. 

They actual research hard evidence, actual science!

## could help everyone can't wait vaccine roll out!

Source check: Thanks this! Clorox/Lysol wipes always cleaning product choice, used use everything it’s driving crazy 8 months! woman know totally believes shit. refuses wear mask shoves people way local supermarket ( masks mandatory ). weeks ago laughing friends faces mask, totally smirking sooo intelligent knows us. feel young kid getting vaccinations crazy mother. Simple sheeple are. major outbreak since May. Sounds like got act together today also marks first time every state plus D.C. least one death. recent instances 48-49 states getting non-zero deaths, always small states either report recorded 245,000 new cases recorded today, including record 36,000 California. Deaths stayed 3,000 third day row. Daily new cases exceeded 200,000 five consecutive days. We've really got raise awareness dangers coconuts. national disgrace. Americans dying everyday coconuts falling heartbreaking. I’m sorry. Good right thing. fuck COVID. goes deeper thought! still wise wear masks indefinite future, probably 2021 tbh. Stores still require masks, still mask ordinances many locales.

I actually hope turning point us culturally. many people still go school/work cold flu? Maybe least get mask up. We've learned much pandemic best ways prevent spread respiratory diseases, maybe work towards lessening spread seasonal flus out. yeah, think is?  **Dec. 12, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

It still sucked national death toll less 1400... Less half amount people died yesterday states alone.



We lockdown protest antimask rallies instead allowing ignorant people put others risk gathered entire police force fined arrested every single person got hands rallies.




Sounds kind excessive paper results lie remindme! 45 days people wanted. asked would say no, enough dumdums acted, reap whirlwind everyone. ? It’s efficacy (at least Pfizer vaccine) based preventing infection. Idk you’re talking about. Prevention infection 90-95%, prevention severe symptoms something like 100%. Oxford AZ trial regularly tested participants iirc. Moderna Pfizer verified person symptoms. DOCTOR told March it’d blow couple weeks. told absolutely case. Anyways still lazy find new doctor since one prescribes medication it’s like actually need accurate medical advice him. percentage 34.000 people increase give vaccine people obviously . 

Oh page 38 . Last paragraph . 

Right see 1000 participants developed musculoskeletal connective tissue disorders Florida? closer Texas. think is? lololol oops remember day. Yeah, sucked, Americans finally felt vulnerability. Still need go war it. read review data taking long? FDA takes raw data companies provide reanalyzes them, often picking apart statistical calculations made manufacturers. Among regulators world over, similar direct check data produced pharmaceutical manufacturers. type analysis, routine new drug approvals FDA, legally necessary emergency use authorizations pandemic. given Covid-19 vaccines could given hundreds millions people, agency decided thorough review needed. interview Wall Street Journal, Hahn, FDA commissioner, said staffers working long hours parallel seeking insiders FDA, even current timeline seems insanely compressed; one insider said Marks, center director, first stated publicly regulators folks nearly fainted start Peter [Marks] stood public said get EUA application turn around weeks,” staffer said. “That heart-stopping moment. people motivated vaccine looking like serious efficacy it’s public health crisis, doesn’t mean there’s fast way EUA process, allows clearances based far less data traditional approval, provision rolling more, FDA said statement, “rolling review” meaning European Medicines Agency U.S. “The EMA access scope data investigational product FDA product development,” statement said. FDA said “tremendous insight” manufacturing processes preclinical clinical research EMA rolling review would point delay Pfizer’s decision drop initial interim analysis, would likely occurred late November. would allowed outside committee peek efficacy results 32 cases symptomatic Covid. Instead, company decided conduct analysis 62 cases; time plan formalized, actually 94 many experts believe would mistake analyze data 32 cases. could clear vaccine effective, clear whether efficacy 60% 90% — would little safety EUA issued regulatory authority based 30 cases, would know much vaccine,” said Jesse Goodman, former FDA chief scientist professor Georgetown Pfizer much data — evidence greater 90% efficacy — drug giant still couldn’t file. FDA’s decision, announced quietly Oct. 6 prelude earlier FDA advisory committee, tell vaccine makers ask EUA half patients studies followed two months. Setting threshold slightly lower would saved time, meant less safety FDA advisory panel held Oct. 22, experts convened FDA said resoundingly would favor conducting studies longer, collecting data. time Oct. 6 decision, approach met resistance White House, pushing faster debate shaped, part, widespread worries even lower standards might hold day.

FDA landed, going draw fire. account, process far faster pandemic emergency, passion concern public health patients admirable, it’s kind like heat battle people lose perspective,” said Goodman, former FDA chief scientist. “And think that’s strong science-based regulatory agency important.” What’s wrong statement? Honestly? find “wrong” that? guess, probably lack research/study adolescents far safety, etc. would help get locked condo hell I’ve since March? bakeries arent businesses popping island. Restaurants take-out/delivery opening too, already pointed out.
Again, businesses deep debt survive even without pandemic. pandemic making reality hit sooner rather later.
Even then, can't evicted. There's halt January. He's saying Biden give another round stimulus checks won't. forced? Ha! focused trying say ""I understand, like it"" even say why.

It annoys me, everywhere. We've used Covid 9/11 comparisons since beginning. Sometimes seems like cheap way get various knee jerk reactions.

These feelings matter, course. Yeah, inequality. That’s makes US stand among rich nations, along lack free universal healthcare. Brazil free nationalized health care so, come USA. this. LA keeps malls movie sets open tells kids stay inside, it’s looks little ridiculous. Yeah. remember texting closest friend mid-march like ""this whole year fucked, it?"" 

And was. John Prine - Hello 

Saddest part it’s anything new it’s lot consequential. assume every single infection gets caught testing system

(spoiler: doesn't)

Antibody studies suggested unlikely higher 1% Western countries. Possibly lower better treatments start pandemic. Poorer countries even lower death rate.

(and no, I'm saying anti-vaxxers justified idiocy. people need get facts right) Got evidence that? Sounds like load bullshit. organizations openly admit shortcomings?

The simple answer moved faster. How? That's figure out. UK slightly. reckless?

Why pick dates review? earlier? asking much move faster? 

Nobody says ask much Drs nurses overflowing hospitals. first, biggest, revolves around FDA decision require two months safety data half patients study company asked authorization. settled less data, vaccine likely would authorized FDA might also able save time evaluated data vaccines rolling basis, instead getting information — Pfizer’s case, tens thousands pages — once. (Regulators U.K. accepted Pfizer’s data rolling basis, FDA argues processes simply — perhaps least consequently — FDA could turned around data advisory committee rapidly, holding meetings on, say, Dec. 3 Dec. 10, instead Dec. 10 Dec. 17.  everything person again? sure getting numbers according [2010 Census NYC Metro 22+ honestly know LA.

Almost every even minor league sports team area sold season tickets 2021 already.

No, he's completely wrong spreading vaccine disinformation. happened months ago, 3 days ago. months likely  almost sounds like he’s taking advantage desperate people. tell friends Healthcare obligation get vaccine show leadership establish trust hard working doctors researchers developed this. 

""We know long term effects "" anti-vax diatribe needs squelched reminder know short term effects covid know long term effects either. 100k people gotten vaccines nobody died except guy got placebo Yup.

But voted Trump Kamala Indian. Dumb fuck. Oh. admit Trump's actions negative impact safety vaccine. However, fact Trump demanded approval moved up. means available faster.

Hmm. Gotcha. makes sense. got tripped thinking “okay well prove person went Friendlys caught Friendlys not, say, gym went day before.”

That clears up. Wasn’t doubting it... “Friday long week” brain going 50 million enough vaccinate good portion high risk individuals, enough reduce hospital strain drive deaths.  neighbor retired hospice nurse tells stories 50% people dying lung cancer blame people smoking.

What cahoots, incompetent. got begin with? think person took first comment mean 1 million people already die another million Covid would make 2 million total. So, source claim Covid would double 3 million deaths typically seen US.  

The first comment said *rate* 1 million, 1 million would die. expect anything June unless healthcare worker elderly high risk Unless find technology that, animal testing likely one ways. sure investigation underway (when focus moves Europe USA), reporting lab results showing Covid December outside china. can't chalk lab contaminations. saying virus capable silent spread without causing much social havoc many months especially beginning outbreak. really see problem that. vaccine 90-95% effective get first...then they're mostly going transmission vector virus.

Well, live rural county. Almost everyone I've talked to, overheard public talking covid masks, act like covid big joke. like bunch rebellious adolescents talking school principle. Specifically, mean I've heard maybe hundred people discuss this, one acted like covid something taken seriously. Across age groups; really, really disconcerting see grown grey haired adults giggling think rules strict. mean fucking weird shit.

As far large urban areas, go read various sources. sounds things, 1 100 people areas take covid seriously. 

Are urban area? so, see adults grey haired seniors mocking covid rules loud public (and clearly overheard others like rebellious HS student front freinds) ratio 1 100 exception? Maybe, goes well. I'm pulling ya! Third/fourth peaks first wave, actually understand people get news facebook (or solely reddit matter). saying? FDA approved tonight hard decision right one. Thank you. Moderna expected approved next week. think necessary all. Nobody could take care. fucking crazy. area live - LA - good masks keeping distance. Literally EVERYONE wears mask even jogging. insanely confused soaring high. central air one ac window boxes? mean exactly happened every single new president? way scenarios difficult understand. NYC metro definitely 10 million. That’s practically population NYC itself. Guys, give idea gravity situation:

We’re currently 300,000. 

90*3,000=270,000

That would mean minimum 570,000 deaths March. 

Assuming vaccine June, would wager count could go 700,000 time remaining.

That would make pandemic deadly civil war Spanish flu US. Well, works pretty good dogs hearworms Exactly.

If lost insurance definitely apply Medicaid. 

But say *""easy"" mask wearing* saying? hard wear mask? People hate facts. Couple fact age bracket question low incidence serious illness, maximum benefit vaccine somewhat reduced. 

That said, understand staged age-group-specific approvals. need studies participants. look data differently, assess impact age brackets. enough 40-50 year olds show effective safe age group, analyzing data along data 50-75 year olds 20-40 year olds approach that's taken. Analyzing data way reduce sample size, though change math. RemindMe! 5 weeks true majority population follows mandates willingly. Bay area wearing masks everywhere since beginning, antimaskers around percentage wise. preface saying I'll get vaccine available.

What failing account variable time.

Say, car analogy. mRNA vaccine, like car amphibious exploring vehicle hybrid.

Yeah, first team get vehicle land water back land safely, dryly, one piece, that's first step.

The team know long design good for. time see vital gasket decomposes 20,000 miles tires blows 2,500 miles got math pressure exchanges rubber water land.

Vaccines like that, except human body.

We know develop vaccines 5, 10, 15+ years. Traditional review methods would accounted released market.

But, said, I'll get available. immediate threat virus outweighs potential long-term effects vaccine. Gotta love big brother. B E  saw shirt said ""keep calm carry on"" found niche. NYE month January disaster. many people like “2020 terrible year, let’s ring 2021!” I’ve already gotten invitation party 30 people evite first sentence “Raise hand you’re ready 2021, right?!” politely turned invitation down. sounds pretty optimistic, actually.

Hate one break US developed, diversified, advanced economic juggernaut history world. transparent financial system boot.

Thats asked college sophomore. make arguments like one. mean ones actually count Coronavirus deaths, without covering numbers?

And positivity rate. *Chef's kiss* roof. could sniff hand sanitizer directly nose 30 seconds didn’t phase me. Read pessimistic posts here, optimism:

1) One vaccine EUAd, another similar one EUAd 1 week. 

2) vaccines enough vaccinate vulnerable disease. cause infection rate plummet starting couple weeks. deaths fall couple weeks that. maybe like 4-5 weeks.

3) one colder parts year. warm spells start happening, people outside instead cramped inside.

4) Treatments continue get better.

5) almost holiday season. Christmas may interesting depending many people decide drive instead fly see family.

6) US 2/3rds mark virus. Within 6 months back normal almost aspects life. Las Vegas depends people like misunderstanding probabilities like this. ten worst casualty count days American history *no longer includes 9/11*. state became mandatory enforce regardless store size. absolutely true - hope transition towards using proven adenovirus methods soon they're available, least reliable data method known fairly reliable terms lack long term effects. People call masks ""face diapers"".... know filthy house becomes never put diaper baby?  God bless you, safe Depends two Georgia senate seats. going change elderly care systems permanently going forward.

My dad needs memory care mom *this close* signing assisted living COVID hit. past year difficult mom caring dad. think going happily go assisted living there's vaccine? NOPE. 

And get old make calculation. South Korea screwed finally hit point. Untraceable see 10000 cases day soon. Alas lowish cases 8 months they’ve cracked pressure now.  It’s deeply frustrating. Especially I’ve spent time living Europe, know doesn’t like this.

I honestly think Americans understood things Western Europe, we’d stage quick reenactment French Revolution.

Day day, things aren’t bad. I’m blue area reasonable government. I’m currently unemployed therefore eligible decent free insurance example.

Honestly feel like often forget people actually interact regularly several notches brighter average, lots people kind idiots. Got remind smart friends aren’t norm.

But it’s malicious idiots get me. Folks don’t understand things, get that, try to, accept expert advice don’t bother me. it’s ones sure cousin outweighs health expert every government.

I’m lucky. I’m white middle class. I’m freaked money, able save fall back parental resources. That’s true varying degrees friends.

It also means horrific police stories can’t happen me. can’t, cop knows there’d actual pushback abuse, won’t try mostly. Doesn’t mean I’m nervous around way I’m Dutch British cops. I’d happily ask either directions, tell say problem, trusting wouldn’t shoot it.

But yeah, there’s low level stress health, housing (oh god housing area. Rent insane, basically find stuff via local connections, trying buy laughable) jobs/savings. 

I think Americans don’t get rest western world doesn’t fears way. can’t lose healthcare, lose job reason, swiftly evicted.

Sorry long ramble, question definitely hit mark lot stuff I’ve thinking lately. seem smart competent too.

I’m honestly thinking trying masters NZ figure stay something. Sorry Australia many big spiders.

Though would hard, family friends US Europe, it’s damn expensive travel. hardship opposed death.

Why easy wear mask? don’t learn history condemned repeat it, learn history condemned watch everyone repeat it. Oh gosh summer I'll able drop kids parents' weekend 2 whole days time. 

Don't judge me.... Died *with* Covid-19, necessarily it. assume include minors studies. even though reason assume vaccine works less well dangerous people age group, *have demonstrated safety efficacy age group.* 

Couple fact people age bracket less severely affected virus, there's reason least assess age group differently. 

Don't worry, age, probably last line get anyway. don’t think vaccine approved 16. kids? Eventually need vaccinated beat thing. offered services Walgreens part 'Operation Warp Speed', immunizing health care providers daily, travelling assisted living homes state. offered hourly wage 20% less normal hourly wage. I'm still going it, right thing do. Well someone burns paper he's incompetent child, hard read. Jeez, country *doesn't* mink farms? feel way. We’re getting married April. We’d love least semi-normal wedding. idea point trying make, absolutely hate Trump, looking pissing match look elsewhere. 

My point trying rush vaccine months, saying he's ""defeated"" FDA's vaccine approval straight dumb uninformed. bunch asymptomatic people population r value spread drops 1 wouldn’t mean cases would become less less frequent? Tl;dr good program specific type financial problem. compare two, Spanish Flu spared nobody. least Covid19 doesn’t kill young alarming rate. Everything else *wasn’t* botched, dude. Witness, today - Administration put effort vaccines, it. go quite well. even medical degree? saying want evidence, different saying think harmful. Basically, they’ve smaller sample 18 crowd pretty confident fine (younger people usually better overall, especially comes things like this), want another round trials confirm. Also, guy responded didn’t miss point question - valid say younger people average better majority voted vaccine right need worried. Thank China rated pretty low cracked it. Japan rated pretty low Sweden rated pretty high. number cases amount time matter? hardly data safety efficacy vaccines past months. took 10 years would long-term data people took earlier study. huge number cases number people trials demonstrate short-term efficacy safety diverse sample population idea long (or even medium) term effects are, no? Better get jump hot guy (no pun intended). may friends thinking thing. would one test that, e.g. would needed? time?  reiterate further, bot. one paying attention surprised this. 😠 Thank understanding hope come strong support! truly cannot understand lack empathy church people. pastor even said “99% fine.” Umm....ok, well, let’s care 1% too. Several friends found churches, “ugly” group louder fb think. want church person. truly help know pastors like you! But, unlinked 9/11, half country going give shit. that's deviation norm. Covid number one killer Americans (all causes) end February. feel like we’re gonna need throw parties like Leslie Knope Ann leaving - holidays year one big night. people including me, vaccine April. So, idea need decide December we'll April ridiculous. I'm still figuring December far income tax situation, since accomplished Dec 31st.        
I think bit much ""lets put carriage front horse"", especially corporate media. people, *plenty* time figure do. legit studies. 
They enrolled 30,000 people needed enough instances disease occur 30k, allow statistics demonstrate vaccine effective not.

Pfizer Moderna seem conducted studies well. Oxford astrazeneca one issues conducted. I'm happy one provides protection virus. one questioned further, expect tougher get FDA authorization. 

By conducting studies well, mean established protocol laid criteria enrollment, randomization, treatment, constitutes positive test, constitutes mild vs severe disease, valid satisfactory field trial looks like. study initiated, moving goal posts.

As someone else mentioned, cases virus over, timeline hit numbers statistically significant outcomes happened much quickly non-emergency vaccine studies.  Yeah, likewise I’m obviously extremely touchy this. Feels like we’re other’s throats. Thanks despite think things start going uphill us whole soon. Yeah, Europe horrible run lately, cumulative deaths per capita EU greater Europe still well US. 
 Furthermore, European death rates trending down, whereas US rates continue climb. Well everyone vaccinated. vulnerable 10% population vaccinated risk Covid deaths complications population large becomes comparable seasonal flu. Everything else basically gravy beyond that. 

The 10% threshold critical benchmark. occurs longer pandemic. ""Become member f*or $5 month join discussion Parler ""* share population isn’t even close. They've done far better numerous countries, would massive improvement. March 13th, day everything changed. Yeah book tho movie terrible take. nobody America would take medical advice Smith that’s like electing reality tv star president. show proof this? could wave hit 0 suddenly start again? Everything I've heard learned scientifically plotted we're indeed second wave according graphs I've seen. Generally 1 5 'non-religious' genpop (and like 3-5% atheist). 
 
Do source figures? seem crazy low, especially percentage atheists, maybe know really non-representative bunch people ...in America. Cause ignore it. I’ve seen reports first 3 groups get access vaccine 1) 20 million frontline healthcare workers, first responders elderly long term facilities. 2) 80 million essential workers. 3) People 65+ comorbidities

I get group number 1, don’t know agree group 2 ahead 65yo + “comorbid”

The vaccine’s proven effect tremendously reduce becoming ill, hospitalized even die infected SARS coV 2. 80% serious cases come 65+/comorbid group. 100 million US citizens front vaccine?

We don’t even know much vaccine slow transmission yet. 

After 30, 40 50 million essential workers, (I’d guess) ages 18 58 get vaccinated... going conduct themselves? keep wearing masks? Distancing? gathering large groups? 

If don’t stay protocols, pandemic-wise? mean 65 plus comorbidities can’t get vaccinated um? March? Later? Yes. willingly take risk. 

You stupid fucks don’t seem understand people care different things you. No, can't start vaccinating second round enough doses vaccinate them, enough expected pipeline treat first round again.

There's nearly month doses person, production increasing time. Current estimates us vaccinating somewhere around 3-4 billion people 2021. Two years, max, get everyone. one studies. 

""Lastly, government actions border closures, full lockdowns, high rate COVID-19 testing associated statistically significant reductions number critical cases overall mortality.""

&amp;#x200B;

but go ahead...just downvote... purpose. people NEED get back work egged Republicans tell Dems reason there's funding. Republicans tell science trusted (which exclusively trump many Republican senators said) course going believe them.

And works well Republicans want us divided. underground raves LA? seeking clarification due confused phrasing. apologize came rude. I'm bit defensive comments people complaining able see movie due restrictions. 

I'm sorry going hard time. Ultimately common folk always get shaft America. feel hope things improve. excellent summary could happen quickly. parallel development paths didn’t hurt, either. help doses distribute. add this, University, nursing student absolute worse students following sanitary measures long shot  Excellent!

Not bad all. Worth risk point. estimation moderna get EUA? old folks get moved nursing homes generally need specialized care....

If 80 year old dad still jogging every day, he's likely nursing home... big brother last years Trump blindly obeying anti-science stance wearing masks? guess think through.   could take one Bezos, Gates, Musk, Zuckerberg, Page, Ellison redistribute wealth equally amongst population.... Umbrella tornado. Time get shit together. Start working again, eating right, clean place. expect lot parties gatherings summer.  states problem!!! Nothing Washington DC!! Says deluded gent Orange cult member family friends. one gives shit original meaning word. anyone idea timeline looks like Moderna vaccine? keep hearing couple days? Pharmacist here. think main issue concentration required inside cells kill covid high really hasn’t considered. strange. anything new, people going need assurances usual. mention like four different companies coming vaccines, like anything else there's going question ""which one best?"". 

Scientists come say they've tested life experience give examples dozens things gone numerous trials end implicated class action lawsuit years later, horror stories outliers.

Skepticism normal part buyer's process months people board. process must occur. take account historical events going make PoC skeptical others first...

If anything, 100% eagerness people get would strange thing. maybe need enforce today, maybe telling press stop spreading lies. Unfortunately people demonstrated inability responsibly wear masks real issue I've run into. partner medical field (not doctor licensed). nurses colleagues spew bullshit. anyone concerned false positives might be? 13k cases, damn. ***YOU*** might get it. fucking learned hard way, sorry shit cereal really dude care People LTC facilities make almost half deaths currently. Pfizer P3 study clear divergence 10 days. I’ll glad say told come mid Feb. Ok end game? vaccine isn’t game changer fuck going happen. 

Are people actually willing live rest life like this????? feel like I’m going insane. huevo cabrones!!! downvote biased source American mink farms like I’d love say I’m young remember, LOL! hell problem? watch meeting listen opinions everyone voted - live yesterday. last 30 minutes think, right voted, discuss concerns insufficient data 16-17 year olds possibly changing language approve 18+. believe folks voted against/abstained. china's fault Unexpected Al Gore health officials believe manage virus effective central planning, folly hubris. 

Lol, seriously? doesn’t take advantage folks though. I’m fan program fair beneficial need it. He's one people. Ofc would defend poor decisions. Exactly. play game pretty crazy slipped by. said. Random ass comparisons dramatic effect mean US website surprising. Well, anti-mask, antivax, social gathering crowd spreading majority disease. I'd imagine anyone contact group areas groups predominant feel effects most.

Although, we've seen lot people travelling lockdown ""vacation"" infuriating. Drugs controlled cytokine storm tested largely failed, memory serves correctly. really don’t know antiviral effect ivermectin sars cov-2 virus people. Realistically don’t know really feasible approach, considering long take get necessary data. Walmart thousand people, shaming doing? can’t wait seeing crowds like doesn’t give anxiety anymore. Covid 99% survival rate diseases course. I’ll take chances . there’s data I’ll thanks . 0.1% US population isn’t dead Covid though, 1% people died would extremely tragic apocalypse COVID's dad? It’s me. I’m “some friends” 😂 Pfizer coming town.

All approvals remind meme

Well done humanity yep... California couple sheets boilerplate sign getting flu shot, long remember. big deal anything, usual ""I allergic eggs"", ""I know shot guarantee get strain flu"" kind thing.  Can’t wait unsubscribe never look again. hope feels like? We're also going hit huge recession thanks trump tax breaks, blamed Biden much production guys? Come widely available right shit easy google guys come like. sure like come words mouth guys said widely production easy read google guys. Simple: Private gatherings. there’s way stop explains doomed fail. Also aid business, shut anyway. care lose everything. Surprisingly per 100k first dose provides immediate immunity (10 days). second dose ensure long term immunity. calculations second dose immaterial. \+235,000 end January? Yikes 405,400 deaths = US deaths Covid total US casualties World War II

I mean, technically, look excess deaths, hit point month ago. confusing two people allergic reaction? contact trace everyone came contact tested PCR positive groups see there's statistically significant difference two. However, even PCR test everyone, people symptoms, since designing vaccine target asymptomatic infections.  So, get full 1% US population dead rather nearly 0.1% dead thus far? new analysis Biogen event Boston hotel concluded coronavirus strains loosed meeting since migrated worldwide, infecting 245,000 Americans — potentially many 300,000 — end virus strains spread least 29 states. found Australia, Sweden Slovakia. wended way room packed biotechnology executives Boston homeless shelters, also spread widely among infections. many people killed virus strains cannot reliably estimated. figures include infections among six million Americans tested positive coronavirus since October, infections cautionary tale,” said Bronwyn MacInnis, genomic epidemiologist Broad Institute Harvard M.I.T. “When hear stories clusters 20 50 100 affected, account happens after.” 

Here [source study published *Science* Thank you! It’s much clear now. know far life still exist Earth? 

Maybe life going core planet too. analogy really helped! Thanks :) maybe opt out. Bro, sucks die this, tens hundreds millions people also suffering. they're gonna end dying, too. age people dying covid right now. die 86 year life shitty gonna better worse someone who's 86 dying year?

Serious answers only. word year 2021 vaccine 2020 pandemic. Excellent summary. still people dispute death count. Saying dumb fuck things like death rate years corona same. can’t stand trying explain things people. Eviction/foreclosure Moratoriums ending, millions losing unemployment...

2020 warm-up 2021 soecific regulation mandates mind asking? replied times below. short, unlikely realize may well talking door knob. That’s exactly thinking.  guy(wearing mask) convenience store told me(the manager) done it(COVID). smh would think deserve hear 5 experts voted way determine extra cautious reasons.

IIRC want approval people 18 years old, current approval includes 16/17 year olds. Everyone surging time one see trains headed straight other. It’s prelude coronary clog. penis arteries smaller diameter. Shipped foreign countries thanks moron can’t keep fucking america first promise. hard say, yes, give us vaccines. Dumb fucks. hope karma follows dumb people deserve die? fuck wrong you? normal life spring? think it’s doable companies vaccines approved. Beginning end now! Don’t catch it, came far would silly fail we’re close finish line! thing need make social security Medicare solvent tax rich people income instead capping it. US, 40% COVID deaths among nursing home residents. Every good thing occurs Biden’s great success. Nothing come previous presidency give credit red party commit sin hivemind. aware biases. ""[D]eforms face"" seems bit severe actually occurs. affected facial muscles may take droopy appearance due typically temporary paralysis facial nerves. fun, people temporary. commonly occurs cold ear infection. agree assessment whether right wrong. People willing give second summer... ESPECIALLY since magical ""be end all"" vaccine circulation. swear GOD get summer hear still need social distance hearing vaccine would end since, like, June... even know. sure I’m getting downvoted this. want hear different thoughts views mandating vaccine. wrong that? Lol.   weeks late type care, doctor sit truly get wellness vanishes Medicare.

Doctors, Dentists matter, get paid peanuts preventative care.

It’s tragic, known doctors attest doctors want well patients. encountered many give ...... sad heartbreaking. account things could likely happen plan them, make longer terms plans limited evidence have, adjust learn more.

So lots evidence people see medium term effects, 3-9 months. can't much data longer that. Heart lung damage especially. Maybe clears year, seem likely.

Way better plan around long term damage finding resolves, opposite.  Biden President distribution really picks up, I'm confident botched. crazy guess things would like hiliary clinton adminstration charge. Would better think absolutely yes still think usa would rough place. Banning china flights early absolutely good move (been downhill ever since) moves early important. culture usa would lead go spread regardless president. Really hard predict. hate much next guy, think put half deaths extreme mismanagement. New York City surrounding states going blow March matter what. Europe going bad patch right now, even countries run people nothing like Trump. America grown fat suckling tit luxury decades. grotesque bodies rippled marbled growing large decadence muscles brains atrophied. docile failed notice milk soured, refusing leave comfort pens, content dream past glories real imaginary. milk slowly poisoned, demands also shrank. desperate comfort refused even smallest sacrifice complaint fear even measly trickle remained would taken too. nation dreamers imagination. shit CDC man. handle pandemic BTW? fucked every step way. 

Thank Dr. Obvious. Italy Florida Europe? Fuckin covid racist knew !  *lot* anecdotal reports articles people saying everything tasted like shit, burnt coffee, etc., we're horseshoes hand grenades territory. That's great way compare. instead use deaths per million 7 day average, gets around different levels testing, US number 15 list. Every country higher death rates last 7 days greater Europe. next 12 US greater Europe well. correlates EU higher death rates last 7 days compared US, Europe whole less - US roughly middle two numbers.

 People giving efforts showing. listen podcast almost daily. rants COVID extremely cringe sometimes infuriating. looked YouTube lot followers tend call bullshit. huge following, typically right wing, irresponsible lot says. 


When started rant economy would fine people blowing proportion. took clip clear wrong was. He's always right-leaning I'd say year gotten vitriolic nasty. rude lot callers now. asides financial incentives, there’s political crisis public figures pushing people distrust public institutions. see election you’ve seen “fake news” used describe people organizations say something negative you. 

Don’t trust deep state. Don’t trust liberals. Don’t trust scientists. “expert’s” got wrong. Everyone’s get me. things said leader country 73 million following. 

And I’d say unique time period. 9/11 happened somehow came together country. Yes disagreements overall acted nation. there’s war truth untruth. Indonesia say 97% Sinovac. guess efficacy rate adjust time place place due genetics something. 1000 deaths day change behaviour...

if 2000 deaths day change behaviour...

What 3000 deaths day achieve?

Surely people sit take notice 4000 deaths day?

This nothing shake foundations everyday life hits 6000 deaths per day?

Maybe 8000 deaths day cause people stir action...

*sigh* essential worker (or frontlines like hospital/healthcare), comorbidities likely later phase covers general public. [NYT example crowd people vaccinated early Summer.



All really depends much supply get going, beyond Pfizer's ~100 million doses available Moderna.  extra dumb thing idea vaccinated people still infect others. senior living facility work telling everyone prepare continue mask wearing least next four six months await data.  It’s common one wants believe. one admits it. side ‘don’t wait people die‘ get money. many people died heart attacks diabetes? Macdonalds still open? government wanted design disease removed huge burden Taxpayers Government Covid-19 would perfect solution. saying. doesn’t seem possible little bit messenger RNA wrapped fatty coating could give people kind reaction. I’m guessing it’s extremely rare, wonder science behind is? keep guard meantime next months — battle isn’t yet

True! fact, trial volunteers still needed second round vaccines badly needed get second half next year (like Novavax). 

I work grassroots organization called [COVID Trial Dash](http://coviddash.org) connects volunteers trials, map trials currently recruiting people interested volunteering: http://coviddash.org. 

Not trials pay, provide free testing/healthcare, 50% chance getting vaccine early. Remember much shit Florida getting summer? California doubling numbers daily thread dumb irresponsible Californians are. 7000 vast array causes. increase number say, 40-50% single cause transmitted communally, make headlines. I’m sorry school failed you.  readout? hope means something like approve it. turning corner, want come back reality going brutal time us,” Dr. Redfield said. 

How many fucking corners house dude? Cause I’m sitting keep turning corner run smack mirror showing us fucking dumb turning the, words, *not-in-reality-corner* try turn back around corner there’s gapping Covid pit middle floor. 

Maybe hold fuck still while, “Doctor”. I’m pretty sure person trolling. Look comment history. think made up. Cite statistics.

This data seems show completely wrong. 2020 deaths look pretty much normal range mean might able wedding July? He's using corona dictatorially rule NYC iron fist. Now, whole restaurant industry suffer gone even get herd immunity. kidding conspiracy right wing q anon website downvoted wrong. vaccine’s main function prevent infection successfully shown something like 94% people. Yes, still *possible* become infected, one infected, symptoms likely mild risk death decreased. carry virus multiple times, symptoms may lesson, even non existant, lungs still full covid. believe built dollar reserve currency. someone like china takes place things get fucked. vaccines herd immunity hope flatline corona. must still high like last several times commented. need lie going mostly somewhere around May USA, make think closer compare nine months went through. helping get least. know many times I've seen someone say they're sad mentally exhausted restrictions others respond with, ""well imagine sad someone love DEAD!!!!"". makes feel like allowed sad turns leads feeling though strong enough. feel strong enough, eventually adopt ""oh fuck it"" attitude save mental well-being. see people can't see they're making worse. anything one ‘gets line’ *something* *something* Third World country wearing Gucci belt  America testing. Check Brazil, India, Mexico, Iran. They're reporting. Brazil least bad probably lot worse. Hospitalizations deaths drop like rock next 2 months, 6. bought ebay extra money. DECLARED it! Assuming liberal friends medical workers nursing home, they'll plenty time see happens first. figure it'll April even readily available enough ass. time we're really seeing thanksgiving death spike, they're flying grandma's next day. firearm related fatalities That's fair enough guess. people participated trials already observed months point, probably going weeks months til get vaccine anyway. Best place world live wealthy. Yes, 86% here. way i'm thankful know people around really are. couple earned respect, lost permanently featured less life on. So, like, unless they're medicine first responders, serve essential government functions, they're going opportunity take it, want pretend they're ""seeing happens"" that's fine. Completely preventable - ridiculous country absolutely will. Hard say high pushes it.

Also means die lots treatable things. right away car crash, 2 years cancer. identify attack helicopter I’m offended speaking kind didn’t need money too. #attackhelicopterlivesmatter Military spending firearm related deaths. like ""science"" lots people ignore.... Moderna meeting week, AstraZeneca one repeat phase 3 (I believe that’s read) holes data. fuck right nonsense. remember day young? I’m guessing don’t remember. 2.9 million doses right? right away ones. 100 million (50) nothing July. Moderna’s vaccine approved July, though? is. administration actively encouraged people get infected, downplayed masks opposed distancing. Would make decent romantic comedy, time based true story (hopefully) neck deep credit card debt know follow basic budget, teach live within means. 

For example, one thing recommends taking debt sources, making minimum payments all, focus paying one debt time, starting smallest one. 

Obviously makes mathematical sense pay whatever lowest interest rate, someone who's cycle living means accruing debt, easier ""stick plan"" start smaller, surmountable debts, work larger debts.

Why 7.7 billion people need vaccine problem facing approx 1 million?
Why vaccine indemnity? (Who pays diagnosed MS caused vaccine 5 years time?)
Why would female child bearing age vaccine virus recover may possibly affect fertility?

I A&amp;E nurse yet catch virus, afraid virus see first hand, people survive quite easily- unless, obese, diabetic existing lung issue extremely weak/old. 

The fear created government media far fetched. 
Considering flu appears disappeared, society really open eyes going on.... secret anything, decided total announced file updated daily contains information deaths patients died hospitals England either tested positive COVID-19 positive test result received COVID-19, COVID-19 mentioned death certificate.""

If dig spreadsheets see number deaths positive tests \*much\* larger number deaths mentioned certificate (i.e. even necessarily proximate cause). actual cause death irrelevant, test. Hence suspicions. Wow, I've thought would like 90 able make plans far future.

That's reddit does. makes sense. would want heart rate dangerously high 180bpm? likely straight understand situation unwell make accurate assessment. borders stop community spread.

​
But made easier control it. 15% dozens cases relatively easy 6 states 2 territories. Even look capital cities, 5 states territories capitals 250km 650km next capital.

Lol, aware Europe's geography? 250 km basically whole Belgium time risking cluster cluster risking community spread. measures reduce risks matter, island.

When island (or country able control borders matter) especially remote Australia likely community cases detect closer real number community cases around, even something slips cracks. Germany started detecting community cases, virus already spreading while. international airports ports entry points, dozens upon dozens different land crossings. borders community spread.

What? point states bordering countries community spread first. 0 self awareness I’m anti vaccine many medications things approved FDA recalled years later causing cancer things, always see commercials TV drug caused taking call number. It’s abhorrent government failed people. devoted followers voters. It’s terrible, people see it’s like ignored need medical attention immediately they’re busy someone deem deserves live you. age, disability, kinds horrific discrimination doctors make people couldn’t stay fck away others wear mask. really pray souls. Even dumbest, ignorant person doesn’t deserve die way. sincerely saddens me. friend told like constantly edge nap. Number one nukes goes long way mattering. Seriously. important dude would never gone inside. 
Hypocrisy like part mess. One would assume. Yes obvious ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Same. remember thinking good started authoritarian country like China much easier contain it. Western countries powers quarantine entire cities weld people homes(to clarify, shouldn't). China need worry trials due process people breaking covid rules, could arrest weld house. Darn shame. know this?  last foot finally dragged across finish line... job ~~well~~ done.

If virus nose, still able infect others droplets aerosolized virus. Lots good points here.

1) Money.

That all. Biden never said wear mask show support him. made lot people wear one since made political. headed back work 2nd week January, going real fun trying convince everyone, mainly boss, SAFER past 2nd week January actually dangerous ever been. funny thing believe virus go hospital tell ""we cannot treat here, take oxygen bottle go home"" take probably ""see, big deal, even hospitalise me"" young person asymtomatic spread it. Everyone needs get vaccine. Wait, what? Bill Gates definitely isn’t worth 330 trillion dollars. mRNA molecule exists temporarily body. stands messenger. plasma cells organelles called ribosomes capable reading MRNA messages secreting proteins. kinds things cell might secrete given time. type RNA totally separate cell nucleus DNA unlike example HIV retrovirus ""hack"" DNA MRNA recipe protein. read self destructs back bases make nucleic acid type molecules go back stew cell plasma recycled. 
In words recipe self destructs breaks stuff already plentiful body. ribosomes make quick blast virus spike proteins triggers antibody production MRNA gone spike protein production stops. 
Everything else vaccine make stable formulation injection none new ingredients. processed excreted body within days hours nothing left could effect long term. Ribosomes altered MRNA carry were. 
Hope helps Whew man, I'll tell what. caught norovirus couple years ago literal fucking nightmare! felt like dying 24 hours. horrible illness condensed 1 solid day. sleep.

People starving, evicted, can’t afford medical care... damn, time highs stock market. Sure, buddy. Whatever say single contagious viral disease literally every single cause death combined? 6’2 lol. Pretty short. Grow more. fear same. Since attack done people, sense *something* needed done show people anyone thinking along lines attack taken lying down.

Coronavirus psychological component. can't intimidated big display force. actually pretty good point. I'm surprised happened yet, would pretty easy organize group Facebook something.  stats I've seen, covid taken, officially, 1.6m lives.

So really ""millions"" lives, unless course believe number false. point covid starts causing preventative deaths people hospitals full infectious people, sad.

 Im Australian covid19 anymore, yes blah blah well ect.... many people .. feel smart people too... saying reaction flu, big deal. gotta lock old people everything fine. Yeah let's lock grandparents isolation die covid, lonelyness.

We need guinea pigs vaccine currently good position. Bill Gates great whitewashing image. literally enough money give everyone million dollars still incredibly wealthy. So, go Seattle see people without homes street, suffering, remember that. Oh no, people least risk *fucking dying* inconvenienced Ugh realised vaccine going approved immunocompromised folks yet sigh much butthurt freedum loving ppl.

It's good outcome australia apart victoria people living pretty much normal localised lives nearly half year. 1.5 mil worldwide cases, yesterday 700k That's microchip Reminds Sheldon Amy Big Bang Theory 100% less dorky way cooler. Also airplane like ideal infection vector shit. Ppl packed like sardines breathing recycled air hours together...good times. That's cousins family got it, flew home earlier year got plane gave everyone else family got there. Nuts. beginning winter though. I'm doom gloomer, winter spread going get worse gets better. Vaccine simply months late, even developed unprecedented speed. people know medical community interested guinea pigs, concerns me. doubling rate 4 months puts us 400000 month ten days. Given current death rate that's right. However, given even winter yet, holidays coming up, trajectory case curve (we're almost certainly going average 2500 deaths per day), Jan 22 seems bit optimistic. 

Would also put us 800000 around May 22. hard imagine average 6667 deaths per day Jan 22 May 22, that's exponential growth do. Vaccines help course, quickly people seem think, really stretch least consider possibility 750000 lost summer. $250 million buys lot micro-chips. /s really letting media COVID units outside special circumstances. facilities full patients staff. room top that, take patient privacy seriously. show small clips local news without showing patients faces. Took minute establish relation. This. it. European countries strictest COVID-19 lockdown policies likely show symptoms depression anxiety, according international study investigating impact disconnecting nature.

I think instead ""Good news"" flair tagged ""Academic report"" reporting article [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143984 ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143984) notion wearing masks forever disagree unless unlucky 5-10% take vaccine effect find hard way die, worse, survive long run conditions going forward feel like veering bit far direction. General public popping thalidomide like aspirin years noticed done.

Some things take time observation, amount manpower funding trim down. need help real doctors look private information, help internet. Yeah immune response literally vaccine working! got stuffy nose got flu vaccine. much better bedridden week Similar places northern hemisphere. Seems thing stopped thing happening sooner widespread infection happened weather turned warm. Whats updated excess deaths? nurse tell touching money dangerous standing near people. Funny, virus yet leap money mouth. Also Canada. see lots countries approving pretty quick. I'm way careful this. want see rollout vaccine hospital bed still can't believe people going take there's ""tracker inside it""

Like ma'am used GPS find location hospital.... I'm flabbergasted. Keep checking states health department. Unless front line healthcare worker nursing home patient/staff, hunker down. worry. Trump Republicans got back. symptoms, separate queue much shorter waits please explain further? really want understand this, but, lacking biochemistry background minimum required physics degree (and old one, that), found anything could understand actually explained know safe long term. 

It probably moot point me, basically last line vaccine, would like know. woot woot! Remember early knew much worse second wave Spanish flu first? Goddamn it. knew nothing could do. Hey, too! Wait...DAMN IT!  Oh man, I’d rather day uncomfortable get shingles. shit kill hurt die. Well see elvis around anymore. Sounds suspicious talking work day. Healthcare setting. 

No one gotten sick facility since March. covid even common cold flu like symptoms. sold idea even overcome pandemic still going wear mask work. 

I usually get damned cold bug couple time year. year. I'm sure what's happening here. agreeing arguing? like ""Here nearest undertaker"" considering obese state read this?

r/Coronavirus/comments/kauola/how_a_simple_smell_test_could_curb_covid19_and/ Personally, I'm slightly leery new tech lack historical data. get somewhat. fucking ready roll sleeve up. Never ready shot life. 1. suspect uncertainty whether vaccine reduces infectivity merely due difficulty interpreting data. Among treatment arm, rates symptomatic disease mortality vastly lower placebo arm. study investigators resources test every single participant covid regular basis, could better determine many asymptomatic carriers. hunch vaccine probably reduce infectivity since vaccinated individual develops antibodies quickly, reduces time virus exists high enough viral copy transmissible others.

2. Mortality much lower younger healthier people, yes, zero. vaccine shown reduce chance death 0.1% 0.01% (theoretical numbers, exact) without serious adverse effects, take it?

3. point vulnerable individuals getting prioritized receive vaccine first well taken exactly states plan vaccinate healthcare workers elderly chronic medical conditions first. Everyone else wait availability. Everyone needs continue social distancing measures mask wearing long time. General distancing however helps.

We case Australia, QLD, two women violated borders brought COVID up. went cafes restaurant, didn’t wear masks, maintain distances people used hand sanitiser. case detected potential spread thousands people tested places made known contact tracing.

It’s perfect shows lowering density people minimum, prevents people catching virus  vaccine card comes identify vaccine, date given lot # vaccine. healthcare workers stay one place. going need cards prove vaccination shot record, change jobs. 

We already Hep b shots, flu shots, TB tests etc etc. guess highly expressive faces evolved possess use communicate useless one soon subdued pandemic Oh yeah no, absolutely. agree 100%. people living fear, I'm including people care survive not. bad. Unfortunately tipping point statistics enough people following rules ruins all. country right protect CFR 2% daily cases hiting 250k today 5k deaths day would expectation.  No, level danger inherently risk actually meaningful life. single freedom - bad circumstances - mean someone die. 

And course priorities lie me. neutral towards people. wont harm deliberately (unless harmed first) wont fuck profit. also people get shot and, reasons obvious, fail mount sufficient immune response still contract COVID. happens every vaccine degree. I’m one people. reasons quite understand, develop antibodies rubella, despite MMR vaccine 5 times. idea whether means could actually contract Rubella, means likely rely herd immunity keep contracting it. ignoring vaccine ready what? havnt seen one fucking post it. Get fuck outta conspiracy bullshit. fuckers like whack-a-mole, get rid come spouting nonsense. post history toxic productive reason here. California back lockdown amid dramatic surge infections. state tallied 1.3m cases, broke record last week 25,000 infections recorded single Angeles county last week passed disturbing milestone 10,000 new Covid-19 cases day, officials fear spike infections resulting Thanksgiving holiday could send hospitalizations surging further. LA officials said one person dying Covid every 20 minutes, county’s public health director, Barbara Ferrer, broke crying briefing talking “incalculable loss” 8,000 deaths. said 'might dead' respiratory droplet vs. aerosol transmission confusion. virus spread droplets 6 foot rule would made sense (since droplets fall ground quickly). 

So basically scientists misidentified transmission mechanism. tried correct it, public health authorities refused change guidelines communication.  taking drive week keep oil moving. Long enough get car normal running temps least. Could good mental health too. would short drive. mother taken opposite approach. last month gotten intense precautions says could never forgive got COVID close vaccine. is, data, heading.

You could attacked fact cherry picked dozen states handful European countries.

Instead showed lack intellect attacking source. open referenced misleading nature already comment thread.

But hey, turns don’t need article mislead.  headline misleading wrong.

Headline says masks. Data says mask mandates.

That’s issue argument. source sucky doesn’t anything that. 118 = 118 

118,000 = 118 Thousand

118,000,000 = 118 Million

118,000,000,000 = 118 Billion (Bill Gates' Wealth)

118,000,000,000,000 = 118 Trillion (The figure used mistake) crap again. terms median age population Italy 5th oldest population entire world UK 50th. Maybe UK start asking still deaths Italy younger population? stupid comparisons.

I thought expected, FDA recognizes urgency without reminding them?

That whole part story make sense. Ok, let's pretend subject trial. I'm going test today. I'm going test next person tomorrow, another one next day... eventually I'm testing people far apart background risk. compare negative test today someone's positive month now?

The way could possibly try get would daily testing everyone, possible. patient coming daily blood swabs, doctor time that, patients staggered. ""partly"" inconvenient - physically possible. Further, really telling us anything pseudovirus assay titer heavily implying. reason say ""yes vaccine produces sterilizing immunity"" possible 100% sure see trends population large - would say looks like duck (circulating antibodies), talks like duck (pseudovirus inhibiton), swims like duck (prevents illness)... probably duck.

Take whole uproar vaccine potentially causing Bell's palsy, example. go onto local news station Facebook comment section, there's bunch people ranting raging causes Bell's palsy. conversations went like this:

""Get vaccine give Bell's palsy? thanks""

The amount people got Bell's palsy trials roughly prevalence would expect adult population, there's evidence suggesting two linked, need worry it!

""Well, something must given Bell's palsy, vaccine""

Alright, there's evidence support that.... even true, Bell's palsy non life threatening reversible condition, COVID significant long term side effects risk death.

""Well that's side effect, knows else could be! Besides, I'm healthy side effects COVID I'll wait let people test vaccine me""

Tens thousands people tested vaccine you, significant short term side effects based know mRNA vaccines, theres indication long term side effects either

""Alright haha guess I'm still taking it""

Like, honestly, good faith conversations get people, get vaccine skeptics sub either. someone says ""I wait see"", usually throw studies them, incredibly difficult convince unless see eyes. side effect, matter unthreatening, come up?

I directly attacked argument.

If problem difference wearing mask mask mandates. think would classified mask skeptic.

I UK mask mandates brought use less 30% 80% places required. canada, starting monday vaccination plan orginally go LTC priority switch Health care frontline. 

The reason pfizer ships boxes 975 doses, box unsealed, cannot easily moved none LTC 975 patients. LTC moderna vaccine. logical there’s possibility go inject people probably side effects.

Why? No, logical all. could claim much basis possibility go percentage-wise inject people. That’s crazy part. Literally nobody high face real consequences nothing broken systems change Either cures covid creates zombies. Awesome either way. mid-2021 need anymore anyway. US government less authoritarian even checks balances, 4 years Trump administration shown. yet, institutions like FDA, CDC NIAID remain autonomous.

The goes so-called authoritarian countries like China UAE. thing countries become authoritarian challenged; seem good sense (more Trump) get vaccine thing right, lose gain. one instances argument hold water, simply fact premise requires somebody like Trump power countries. People worried taking vaccine heart attack way home. Long term damage main concern, cited one [members FDA's committee voted well [government ) (who refused approve citing lack long-term data). Repeated amplification alone could easily produce false positive, go step further, sequence amplicon, identify 100% sequence identity reference genome. 20k capital city people country massive. contrast, huge majority people measurements genuinely buzzing excitement. nurse administering loved enthusiasm! I'm nurse quite bad astma period quite challenging industry obliterated this. LEGALLY ALLOWED WORK. yeah, big deal. can't afford it. Look economic situation, look massive business loss, can't ""wait"" people stubborn.

Once reached point option vaccine someone's responsibility get they're physically able to.

Line sand: lock vaccine mass circulation simply people take it. dumbass minority can't allowed hold country hostage tank stupidity. guess what? government going actually able enforce Lockdown August next year, think probably know that. 

And I'm talking right away vaccine circulation get that, we're still fucking around 20% people voluntarily getting November, year now, lot available...what simply cannot accept that. 

I'm putting life hold ruining economic future piece shit anti-vaxxer, neither you. people want condemn early death ones intentionally putting front train...its either responsibilities pull it. Furthermore, care refuse get vaccine, they'd prefer see financially ruined rather take it. 

If want get covid die point, I'm sorry care. made bed, rest us vaccinated. can't get vaccine, need find way protect yes, unfortunately may lock down, overall can't continue tank people's livelihoods careers fucking idiots time next year. it, know zero people willing either.


I'm. Not. Waiting. vaccine full circulation, experts begging people get vaccinated, 60-70% us already right thing got it, I? owe people cared financial loses past year want continue losing everything feed idiotic theory vaccine? Fucking nothing. I'll protect can't get vaccine distance them, play games anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately, numbers recorded.
As article states, investigating 115 cases Michigan's prisons alone. Iran health officials said must correct herd immunity thresholds reinfection frequent.

I know count West, pretty sure official numbers tip reinfection iceberg. I'd surprised risk reinfection three months 10%. close everyone wears masks required I'm fortunate enough able stay home virtually indefinitely wait let others get vaccinated first. I've staying home nearly 9 months now, going outside really need to, another year make much difference me. long I've got internet connection, I'm good.

Perhaps would help could choose vaccine get, understand hesitancy mRNA vaccines, inactivated vaccines well known enough people normally vaccinated receptive. None whatsoever! shut fuck up. isnt flu. people like make reason cases bad. gfy fucked right even Democrats win elections shit middle class poor. voted Biden taxes going even though lied said wouldn't. can't wait pay get less. Eternal gratitude brilliant scientists brave trial volunteers making historic moment possible!

I mean Trump said going fire head FDA unless approved vaccine within hour. really anything scientists volunteers. *crickets* wait side effects kick in, oh boy fun. I'll call now, vaccine leave bigger percentage people scarred dead virus Bold move leaving /s Americans selfish Right 3 weeks js months. rest school year May? point somewhere?

Truth is, way better US, BRAZIL, ITALY, Spain India. like Poland always used benchmark lol Happy terribly jealous. Enjoy safe! This. 100%. Nice ad hominem me!

Set aside context popular argument is, there’s even disease.

Just use line: “Still evidence masks work”. That’s here.

Then back argument charts spread disease point chart mask mandate issued.

Just two things. chart headline. simply don’t line up. say “mask mandates don’t work” data, ok, let’s talk. “masks don’t work” data? Masks aren’t mask mandates. 

To make leap requires evidence linking mask mandates mask usage. haven’t presented assortment charts. personally *no* idea link mask mandates mask useable, generally, suspicion they’re totally followed.
And article didn’t give anything either. wouldn’t trust warp speed either. government redirected PPE earlier year say wouldn’t shipments. feel way flu Yes, read reason huge increase.

Before, published numbers people, infected Corona needed treatment. decided publish real number new infections per day. don’t need vaccines may well let others them. state tallied 1.3m cases, broke record last week 25,000 infections recorded single day. 

Amazing date already is. 37,000 yesterday climbing. Unless going complete shutdown
I don’t understand people even asking cases keep climbing smh
The population completely stopped caring yes may shutdown indoor dining bars everybody starts turning towards house parties still practicing social distancing see working cannot stress enough frustrating seeing people last week say thing like it’s killing small percentage population saying “OMG vaccine killed two people way taking it’s worse virus” maybe friends lot brain dead’s Facebook.  Well it’s doctors let world know issues. feel like doctors complicit making medicine money. things terrible, surprised aren’t valued much money making machine- like car mechanics. Doctors aren’t revered superstars parents grandparents day. 

Very people understand doctors treated. keep quiet, one nowZ family member passed away (not covid) weren’t able say goodbye go funeral due border closure. Imagine stupid. God country fucked say this.

What people fail understand young people dying (and old people 100 surviving w/o severe consequences) make news they're unusually rare point statistical outlier.

Sure, sucks young healthy people died COVID yes, could happen anybobody. statistically likely all. Fauci fool
 Good thing even bigger Holiday coming up... Early on, said depending amount virus breathed affects sick one gets always made sense me. breath single micron passing someone, get minor infection. sit next someone breathe many microns period time, get much larger dose body fight therefore larger infection. Lots deaths, government testing people symptoms traffic light system implemented know it’s safe resume activities irrelevant (and said subsecretary charge response pandemic) also said continues say masks useless.

The first doses probably go politicians elite mx.

You check daily data r/covidmx. I’m disappointed comment didn’t rhyme. know history?!? /s human trials start August I'm pretty sure.. still required trial steps need wait funding stages. Love inclusiveness people watching whole time see. Ive data junkie whole time could see coming. 
 Even shut today, completely, hospitals overnight bad. 

But places scaling back weekend..so everyone going go eat spread places. do. Thanks heads up. Donald Trump emboldened idiots point think say whatever want without consequences. big Supreme Court Hail Mary Texas case got thrown humour scientists doctors try mask still mask patriot? guess vaccine already fake virus can't hurt start wearing mask now? [That actually need least one measure (bump age couple years) reach solvency.

It's also worth noting example pulled actually already combination measure. eliminate cap, also provides additional benefits contributions current cap. Look think mRNA.

They still different vaccines, variations theme.

Good luck. ramping manufacturing plants making, installing certifying new medical grade manufacturing equipment takes time.

The supplies current plants largely already taken.  Hardly. 28 confirmed, 1673 probable 71.5m cases worldwide even close 1% let alone double digits. Something happened Turkey yesterday caused jump 825,000 cases yesterday alone. That’s huge increase Quit trusting people claim science wizards follow up. I'm simplifying here


There exist two different types variables, qualitative versus quantitative. many cookies versus good cookies are. sort Farias measuring determines sort research model methodology use, least limits you.

Medical experiments like vaccine research quantitative. measure many people got sick, sick were, basically measuring construct. well gives reliability validity.

Pfizer's research model self reports, self reports qualitative data get since actual rater involved giving basic reliability. Reliability caps validity. Reliability caps validity, period.

To use qualitative research model ie. self report quantitative construct like vaccine effectiveness means someone something, basically means initial trial results suspect purely research processes perspective.

The problem none go bother reading yourself, instead spoonfed mean puppies rainbows? mean 'wtf people doing'.

TLDR step ever closer acknowledging educational field. small price pay could get back beers! still friends think like flu still friends believe shutdowns ineffective. Even friends generally responsible believe science still socialize, go bars, go restaurants. certain parts live, rare see masks masks covering nose. pickup takeout, restaurants still packed, bars. Maybe confirmation bias, maybe lack education, maybe lack empathy. Regardless, disheartening frustrating. I'm moving America 3 days, move delayed 6 months due covid, feel like I've hit lottery. reference, I'm 25 year old male American south. Yeah, almost like covid impacted country! Would vaccine even help you’ve already gotten it? Youtube decided yesterday recommend brief video meeting wild wolverine trail. 

The wolverine carrying head goat. wolverine do. EU thank that.   wrote 118 trillion calculation lol. It’s amazing confidently slander Bill Gates anybody gives praise, can’t take 5 seconds double check slander actually correct. nobody taking opinion seriously. today Los Angeles County seen 13,000 new cases one day 37,000 whole state. Southern California region 6.2% ICU availability.  tried tip video... me, worse fit depends face. I'm tall appeared happen technique used shortens mask fit smaller face.   

The thing noticed, (she stress getting knot close mask possible) knot right mask tuck material work end bulge, exact opposite want. 

In end, get better fit without modifying surgical mask, pull chin get tight fit.  

Additionally, mentioned adding nylon hosiery sleeve gets 80% effectiveness.  use thicker Halloween polyester blend mask achieve effect... stretchy holds surgical mask tight face. many designers styles available although prefer Husky dog mask.  IMO much better appearance pulling sleeve nylon hosiery head. I'm mad we're CLOSE worldwide distribution several good vaccines (in fact UK already started one them) rather governments telling people stay safe avoid interactions little longer... people encouraged mix around Christmas time.

This feels like someone getting shot dead trench enemy know war ended 8 hours before. People vaccinated US might even hit peak deaths another month. False security + avoiding liability name game. 

Placing tables 6 feet apart requiring masks entering reduces risk risk still realistically there. 

It everyone's sense personal risk assessment think worth not. obvious dangers putting trust whatsoever belief system. belief systems ignored completely. Good thing outgoing administration focused election results instead saving lives. /s  5000 confirmed. actual sadly higher. LXXXVI works there's liability form company. company held liable spread virus work place incentivized require it. I've solid cries year finally full blown breakdown yesterday. took care 40 year old previously healthy got covid. kidneys fried, heart fucked, lungs look horrendous. trach dependent likely die within year. living perfectly normal healthy life prior covid.

She awake coherent. could see fear pain eyes. like looking soul seeing nothing anguish. face eyes stuck mind week since taking care yesterday cracked.

I cried HARD. went fetal started hyperventilating, laid shaking crying unable move. feel angry people taking seriously, feel sad people died lives forever ruined, feel fear could loved ones patients position, feel helpless really anything help people.

So yea, struggling. Big time. experts understanding virus spread droplets aerosols well. droplets likely hit ground within 6 feet. We've come observe spreads aerosolized particles well. like 2022. “We’re seeing daily numbers cases hospitalizations we’ve experienced and, frankly, anticipate.”

Then FAILED. currently December!

“two weeks flatten curve” _March_. 

This exactly warned us repeatedly 9 months ago. didn’t anticipate aren’t prepared? recently heard effective way combat fake news rather debunking, offer new correct information. currently narrative head replace narrative Yeah that’s thought. wife going try another year super hesitant get vaccine. Wearing mask social distancing stores, along plexiglas barriers sanitizing hands leaving store reasonable precautions kept safe despite gone shopping hundreds times since March. It’s perfect better shutting everything down. House parties, hand, usually involve groups maskless people confined area talking hugging. worlds apart terms exposure level shouldn’t held equivalent other.  hours ago - 'four people paralysed vaccine', comment sub.

A safer headline would been:

1. Facts rarely compelling arguments.
2. people lack education come valid conclusions. science, scientific journals, newspapers interpret findings. Oops! Sorry got excited saw article. Thanks! I’ll remove it. quick maths: 

9/11 deaths: 2,977

90 Days

 Greater 2,977 Deaths/day

 Greater 2,977 x 90 = least 267,930 Deaths 90 days...3 Months...

That's Crazy.  So, first math way others pointed out. Secondly, gives TONS money charity, pledged give vast majority remains charity well. can’t pick ONE cause one city say since hasn’t fixed isn’t enough. doesn’t enough money fix every problem world. causes fix homelessness, he’s choosing focus those.  nobody cares, including racist President, really represent good chunk racist culture cesspool country.

I heard good answer worried LONG TERM affects vaccine.

I planning getting moment available me, I'm fence. Might worth low risk individual fine staying home (most of) time. months safe assuming take vaccine, anti-vax sociopaths be. think Fauci said somewhat recently thinks packed stadiums fine summer something like that. Fire them! It’s people like everyone else following rules furious Trump pressure FDA head again? seems unlikely would decision yesterday without Trump pressure. doesn’t help people trust vaccine. sells advice getting debt. hate debt. statewide mask order, even without fines enforcement, could prevent many thousands cases. vaccine 90% effective preventing infection, comparable wearing N90 mask. *speculation Ah anti christ  I’m criticising UK govt handling it’s really easy work UK deaths Italy (currently hundred though). UKs population 8million (13%) Italy course deaths would expected. 

Also article AP Indy even they’ve published website. Biden even gone office anything, stupid fuck. Ok, vaccination trains immune B cells make heap antibodies SARS2 quickly detect SARS2 virus. antibodies killing, immune system makes antibodies. it’s fine antibodies flushed system. trained immune system detects SARS2 make new antibodies time stop getting sick.

No?

You're getting one months calm high concentration expected?  DECLARE BANKRUPTCYYYYYYYY!!!!!! vaccine gonna antivax Ms Rona bout get knocked out. 👏 able get pack 35 Target.

Science based faith. based multitude historic assessments data tests, Science uses predict new hypothesis. Scientific study turns wrong, that's good thing Scientific community learns goes back drawing board.

Religion hand? religious hate idea belief evidence wrong. ""There's one truth truth never questioned impossible wrong!"" Immunity infection actually quite robust. Even though drop neutralizing antibodies 3 months post-infection, still maintain significant amount antibodies least 6th month mark additional decline evident. Natural infection produces strong cellular response well, meaning virus-specific memory B cells produce antibodies exposed SARS-CoV-2 well memory cells immediately recognize work eliminate virus upon re-exposure. this, said message gets lost.... biggest take away people like confronted mortality. take precautions avoid others, simply tune point utter denial. 

We something litterally (and use word correctly) impacting entire world. Daily told people dying. people want hear it. dont want reminded it. simply tune out, worse deny it. 

It's fake blown REAL means might die. cannot rattling minds. simply outrageous even real must fake. People believe whatever hell want believe get it. Accepting virus means accept inconveniencing lives can't that. “If immune system never anything” well, COVID would kill eventually caused cells lungs go lysis. order spread COVID, replicating cells,and it’s replicating cells, immune system combatting make antibodies wide range COVID proteins. Spreading also requires replication.

If N-assay shows equality vaccine control arms, assume people still catching COVID asymptomatically, social distancing continue around unvaccinated. would use vaccine prevent severe disease continue work towards finding one provides sterilizing immunity. don’t think case, won’t know stage trial run. would 14 days due staggering cases single month...after single month USA would zero cases...

Yeah, borders would closed already done. grandma actually turns 80 May, it'll great grandchildren running around. thankful. vaccine rushed. talking friend 20 years works viral vaccines - John Hopkins PhD shit. process rushed, ""stacked"". Nothing time based rushed, funding manpower normally would get able stack steps normally would linear yes danger averted, we're shutting industry, everyone working industry homeless, importing chinese cola instead. shocking, upsetting, outrageous disappointing.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Obviously extreme majority people get fine, plays ""wait see"" types answer, making people stupid wanting wait see edge cases look like vaccine (rightfully) rushed market shitty. ""locked down"" agree opinion church situation. don’t agree opinion.

Outdoor dining big deal. live Los Angeles. Many restaurants set outdoor “enclosed tent” people eating (without masks obviously). It’s eating indoors. Stupidity another level pointless put blame consumers, exactly buy mink straight cages. Canadian government big progressive values regulatory authority allow farms exist. talking fear, science. 

If make reasonable assumption COVID works like coronaviruses, assume lots people recover nevertheless plagued severe, lifelong complications.

But 70% 330mil people 1% fatality rate (China still reporting 5% back then), 2.3mil dead Americans. probably won’t far it’s said done including excess deaths. im professional applied sciences. Post graduation 10 years.

I however study Australia sophmore year. experience basically extreme majority Australians much higher standard living here. main things helping affordable education, free healthcare (my experience ER infintely better Ive here), reasonable minimum wage limits.

I've done fair bit international travel comfortably say citizens ""first world countries"" generally happier, better work life balance, factor lesser educational, retirement healthcare costs find money burn far many Americans. 1/3 Americans dont even leave US, partially cant afford $135 passport. good chunk population lives paycheck paycheck poverty.

When travelling around Latin American often meet Europeans Australians Americans despite fact countries geographically closer US far vacation time. Theyre often found nicest resorts too. 

Why think US economically ""advanced"" countries? bigger consequently diverse better stretch. Id argue Germany Singapore overall superior science engineering economies example. vaccine coming invented Turks Germany.

Our tax code literally 11,000 pages. special interest loopholes. 

Have travelled? sound like youve Texas whole life. Nope. get PCR tests every week. mean, make lot sense. represent smaller portion population make tragedy smaller.

Each tragedy. pretty pessimistic, even think we'd get 200k deaths end year. underestimated many people still think big deal. Intellectualtakeout.org??

More like IntellectTakenOut.org People way optimistic. get it. much want attend sporting events go back clubs far away happening. Everyone wants pandemic end partly selfish reasons. Yep! It’s important note democrats could way covid general. doesn’t negate awful worse nothingness GOP, least dont even pretend side. expect better Dems they’ve failed (yes, know, McConnell) good news honestly never gotten first place US shit together OP lockdowns mask wearing. Australia closed multiple borders. national borders closed, state borders hard closed too. 

Having said closing borders enough combined decent quarantine system plus decent track trace system important parts equation.

While extent restrictions Australia less possible elsewhere, elsewhere really everything possible powers either. Sorry, believe Australia natural advantages I'm frustrated disappointed countries Canada, Europe, US even Japan. I've always thought started end Cold War, time beginning.  also ordered churches, synagogues, mosques closed let marijuana shops remain open. night America.. dont know yet!

Which would better results? answering every question “we don’t know” February March, did, saying they’re waiting better data, it’s coronavirus, working assumption works like coronavirus, airborne primarily spread droplets.

We’d focus masks day 1, instead useless sanitizing obsession everyone went on. mom works covid patients ICU every day, state prioritizing nursing homes getting next year least :/ . coworkers gotten though(many nursing home workers know have), maybe hospitals PPE problems present areas better move. people start spouting standard xenophobic response; step back realize trying shove throats US.

Anything less monthly regular payment insufficient. kind low quality, anti science nonsense mods love see. ya Wow 90s time warp. garbage text website formatting. little way escape would assume early form virus less contagious/less severe...

Or pandemic detection/responding/reporting mechanism Europe/usa/around world broken demonstrated throughout 2020 Well raise interesting topic. quarantine, fewer people died due normal causes death. Looks like numbers track average 2020. 

So, we’ve got far fewer people dying due incompetencies far people dying due president’s incompetency. 

But, again, you’re mistaking trend projection whole year. one claiming 1 million people die 2021 Covid. Wow wth! Worthless anti-vaxxers. right reddit?

Or, *crazy thought*, maybe correct response vaccine skepticism linking relevant safety data cost/benefit analyses, rather blanket statements vaccines inherently safe. Ive saying weeks mods always remove comments case full lockdowns, government policy may effective countries easily implemented enforced. example, United States challenges enforcing lockdowns, citizens several states publicly protesting public health measures limit viral transmission, encouraging open revolt [40].

From lancet article OP keeps touting. btw OP lockdowns havent working people like you, whove undermining countries response disease since day 1 Feel sorry all, lucky Australia virus eliminated! Cuomo getting medal response COVID included killing insane number old folks nursing homes. It’s insanity. pandemic honestly reinforced need essentially abolish politics reform entirely corporate interests creeped way far extent people dying simply existing. It’s sickening. That’s still less 6 months data. There’s reason it’s getting emergency use authorization normal approval. There’s little chance I’d take vaccine little data long term effects many circumstances. wouldn’t even normally approved clinical trials fast never mind approved general population. thought said St. Nick immune COVID? USA USA USA!!! NUMBA ONE! Fuck stats say. change definition stats fit purpose. That's College Juniors roll! USA USA USA! disagree. Well one did, otherwise occupied time think follow research. understandable given workload. hospital works operating 95% ICU capacity, etc. That's really great question. I'm doctor guess would vaccines designed generate strong enough immune response already sick person. Instead doctors use therapeutics drugs, antibody cocktails used immediately attack infection. Nobody shut down. don’t understand calling that. Newsom didn’t want close malls Christmas sets tone rest us. 

Unless federal government wants give national guard power enforce shut majority Californians going keep living lives precautions. Yes that’s respiratory viruses work wish EU would authorize Pfizer Moderna vaccines emergency use already. Waiting end month drags needlessly. France objectively lot better America. quite Australia tbh, anywhere better moment I’ll pass thanks I’m anti-vax. personally vaccinated everything exists, notable exception annual flu variant. 

Skepticism, questions, critical thinking looking facts data make one “anti-vax”, it’s mark intelligence. 

Thank you. runs donut shop northern Ontario called Don’t Crueller Anyone else getting really really sad? Like first half pandemic sad fellow humans suffering dying wasn’t deep rooted sorrow. feel like I’m mourning country. pandemic feels like killed US. Instead temporary problem reason feels like one many nails coffin preaches getting debit can’t without first getting debt. love type beautiful “I miss life” post follow “daddy af” hahaha kind person Yes, agree reporting nuanced scientific enough throughout entire pandemic. actually underestimating scientific literacy average person, kind shocking. Maybe Dr.Redfield spent time convincing Trump take virus seriously less time increasing personal salary sycophantic creepy-bearded turd? Yeah... even more. hard. Ah missed one yesterday! much noise Pfizer FDA ACIP meetings. Interesting data, though super impressive difference median recovery time (1d), curious really statistically improved patients oxygen, mechanical vent ECMO (though probably powered determine difference subgroups). Likewise would nice statistically improve mortality. interesting see gets recommended moving forward. Thanks! not. You’re choosing find points valuable reason, better alternative explanation rampant reinfection. I’m tired staying house kids wanting go outside. neighbors don’t social distance wear mask. frequently people kids want play mine. It’s ridiculous. ...he told dubious reassurance. lot credible scientists raising questions vaccine. need science. need skepticism, crucial part scientific discovery. pushing anti-skepticism anti-critical thinking agenda think questioning vaccine pushed world record breaking time “pushing narrative”. 

If even looked post history you’d see time I’m calling bullshit r/conspiracy extremely skeptical side things too. rushed anti-conspiracy side things immediately assumed I’m crackpot who’s nefarious reasons. wanted see r/coronavirus say skeptics, I’m honestly impressed. see sub way see r/conspiracy, massive, agenda pushing, anti-criticism, overly defensive, doom gloom circle jerk. China's fault american government failed continues fail people? Yea, probably right. frustrating.  don’t think ever trials pregnant women they? would considered unethical. Look mate, really weird here. said hope we'd get confirmation soon stops people infectious. That's it.

Go away invisible force field bullshit. Almost 3000 people die every day one fucking illness. Shut fuck Yes. Victoria getting top c19 spite newscorp, newscorp. 

I hated lockdown, found anti-Dan line Australian (newscorp owned) actually distressing. 

I sheet lot blame home Dan Andrews administration stuffing first hotel quarantine. c19 getting control something it, did. effectively. Booster creates high affinity antibodies stronger longer-lasting; like second workout building foundation first workout. Honestly though pandemic made shit ton money stock market, shouts sub! Societal, social pressures fear mongering rampant sub, helps biotech companies soar me. lot people end interpreting kind info ""masks work"" states. broke Italy Korea back February sub still tiny, lot people terrified would go global. like.... readers infer line questioning?

According DHS “What found far sunlight seems detrimental virus,” Dabisch explained. “And within minutes, majority virus inactivated surfaces air direct sunlight.”

Outdoor activities **during daytime** pretty safe given sunlight. somehow, cities interpreted outdoor activities safe time, hence outdoor dining even night still allowed places right now. suppose right, people also like told *feel*, feel like misguided attempts instill right™ amount fear public embolden conspiracy theorists people already distrust authority. 

You could tell individual COVID killed upwards 300,000 Americans since March, might inclined stay home. could tell they're 20 healthy, probably die. perhaps also include relevant studies long term damage might spread love. point going lose average American, question where? stop point, someone always going dig deeper say misleading. fine line I'm glad job draw it. Alright I’ll gladly wait see nothing filter anything far tell thus far. website either.

Theyre facts. fear mongering. Maybe people like took seriously hundreds thousands dead. hey ""live life"". Selfish. fire nation attacked. America everything cost money god. Anything interferes prob. Dont believe me, look politicians worried about...the economy. cant let economy tank, economy falls dont nation, ect. heard cannot allow covid take many lives. seems government acceptable many die. all, circles. Ive seen action put forth toward post election non-sense toward covid response thus far. Hope vaccine works, people gonna shit.  website compares covid guidelines around world? Looking particularly distance recommend socially distance, long quarantine exposure, easily comparable metrics. It’s job. Half family nurses PAs.

Nope.

Australia achieved something pretty much every country could achieve (especially USA)

The fact failure. Australia unique lucky way. came first, chicken egg, theory. 

If high risk populated vaccinated, would enough impact lower workload, needing vaccine Healthcare workers less desperate? clean? check penis anus

(what catchy ring phrase say quickly several times) challenges enrolling volunteers developed countries right now, they're still ""least worst option"". 

Developed countries better clinics infrastructure enrolling subjects, particularly healthy subjects. FDA EU preference US European ""data"" particularly likely match ethnic make-up countries. Developing countries might also good metrics disease incidence makes setting studies countries uncertain. also sometimes long regulatory start-up timelines countries (Brazil take 9 months) whereas FDA, EMEA agencies signaled willingness expedited submissions approvals. Finallly, ethical concern (warranted not) using people developing countries ""guinea pigs"" developed countries

As far high risk people essential workers, drop study time line vaccinated.  lost hope strategy McConnell got re-elected. yeah maybe consequences time. stick massive fines ($1200 per person followed potentially jail)

Or, wild *out there*, make billionaires pay fair share? telling Bezos needs freaking money hassle pay pennies journalists report he's okay associated with? even thing first place?

We've seen paywalled news get you: fake news takes control industry. Murdoch cohorts freaking stranglehold US Australian news industries it. Lockdowns work used properly. take scientist know people stay home virus spread. U dont sound logical agreeing wjth rush it.

Reddit stupid. Things defined pro anti trump freaking huge! Thanks man. definitely want check Australia, I’m great humidity giant spiders. Thanks tip Sydney, good hear overblown.

I really love high deserts American West, get sense cattle country outback similar, kind harsh beauty.

If ever get chance, America quite beautiful, national parks marvel, Americans generally friendly, stereotypes Australians good.

Dude, congratulations making homelessness, that’s huge achievement.

I definitely feel lucky right now, can’t imagine didn’t support networks, hadn’t gotten expanded unemployment, fallback plans.

Really worried mean country, businesses destroyed, homes lost, lives destroyed. Doesn’t seem like recipe people turning away authoritarian populism.   Shocking genuinely don’t know what’s wrong this. explain? But... covid preventable. deaths could avoided. extent, maybe you’re right. people don’t wear masks likely die. innocent coworkers, fellow neighbors, children etc. government could prevented 100% 2020 tests positive covid-19. 11. first started getting sick, apples tasted like metal dish soap. Later on, tasted like nothing. Mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing cheap. PotUS politicized them. FDA says safe, CDC says start injections. Honestly, so, many people following rules. many us zoom calls talking friends afar, hugging family, last 9 months. 

I fucking sick tired reading comments like ""yep, figures, one right thing."" see every post. trying signal? knew bad? adding?  


Fuck, I'm probably adding anything either. I'm tired, trying, many others know too. Pfizer vaccine 30 micrograms moderna vaccine 100 micrograms per dose?

Are lipid nano particles different too?

Would moderna's cause frequent/severe adverse effects? become vegetable. fully aware everything body goes paralyzed. horrifying. real tho many deaths solely due covid? Arent hospitals labeling everything covid get money feds? Also many deaths people 70 arent overweight obese? hear going crazy part. media people tend focus polarization pandemic driving us apart, bother think cooperation empathy collectivism dealing global crisis brings people different creeds, etc together single goal reduce much harm possible.

Stay strong, absolutely right side history, friends. God hope writing guy reads around 2120 next mass killer pandemic happens. 

The fastest way defeat lock everybody homes two months. Government pay people decent universal pay, every resident country two full months over. That’s fear tho. absolutely long term data vaccine even vaccines type do. That’s biggest hesitation I’ve heard. Everyone saying it’s safe basing one data months old. It’s simply possible know long term effects humans. Granted also idea covid might long term either I’d take risk vaccine. anti vaxx people would die Real Lock downs definitely does. half ass ones definitely much due people obeying Crap. one dr. John campbells recent YouTube videos stated known risk mostly people history type allergic reaction. Thursday said two people reaction aware risk type carry epi pen everywhere probably unlikely someone without history allergic reactions. I’m gonna hug everyone see even ever hated isn’t selfish. deserve beautiful wedding family friends. FDA says good administrated. CDC says administer it. someone born raise South OKC went ton huge storms including May 3 '99 tornado &amp; 2012 tornado... always amusing people take vacations storm chase. bad way good way. amusing. large corporations (i.e. major banks etc) social media policies. usually follow two tents; 1) disclose work and, 2) say anything could embarrassing create negative PR company.

It's double edged sword; prevents stuff like happening also prevents things like early pandemic nurses disclosing lack PPE.

So good bad. contagious virus 2019 killed 300 thousand counting really bad trying obtuse? I'm pretty happy. Meanwhile guys got dudes refusing life-saving surgery buying insulin would ruin families irreparably financially. Literally choosing die. joke. varies neighborhood neighborhood. mine, hardly anyone wears masks narrow sidewalks impossible social distance. like since pandemic began, though. I’d consider life long brand new allergies cropping weird auto immune things like what’s seen instances UK vaccine trials honestly worse “long term effects” COVID, many proven recover go away time. McConnell probably block vaccine distribution fiscally responsible, instead propose targeted bill target completion Mexico wall. goul power. number people think 80 yr olds today WWII mind blowing. Seeing shocked error pointed surprising Well, thing bad affecting US life expectancy. living fantasy. earth talking about? Nobody saying FDA going get done today. Trump theater. approval moved up? original date? Pure conjecture. didn’t require anything, unlike wearing mask

Even Fox News liberal him. brain washing plain simple. stole dad me. drove girlfriend SC, secluded beach friend husband socially distanced activities wore masks. travel holidays, modicum respect others, conscientiousness speck critical thinking abilities.

So yeah, people stay fuck home much ask average person. Yes, long term studies. 9 months way short especially severe side effects popped rare instances haven’t even begun studied yet. It’s way soon. It’s also insane could prevented proper border closures contact tracing happened. Fuck, forgot reality bit.

Just watched Elf first time, new episode Attack Titan, sick Virgil combo Twitter bu SunhiLegend. riding high Okay then, over? It’s impossible society like forever there’s vaccine coming, people really slacking face masks, socializing etc. probably double time fair amount people vaccinated. 
People seem think vaccine means “treatment”. can’t covid, get vaccine magically get better. prevention. didn’t realize many people didn’t know today. Got get sites first. would interesting able compare ""strong"" response pandemic instead would do. We'd still issues, course, ones going issues vaccine comes out. many deaths? cases December, like could pulled Madagascar closed country. 330,000,000 lot people. government somewhat limited response us actually rights, unlike people China. Would response like Spain (1,000 deaths per million, 330k deaths here) Canada (347 deaths per million, 114k deaths here)? Even rate Canada managed would still 9/11 every 10 days. Would ""a 9/11 every ten days"" still used score points? I’m sure care plant closed. That’s gonna affect business. Cries third world country tell new disease killed 300k Americans 2019? think missed worries many ""me firsts"" prevent others getting it. Like politicians justifying getting normal person. Yup. someone fucked immune system absolutely way going body. Seeing albeit rare extreme immune system responses happen something ain’t mood considering lived hospital much childhood 4 years adult. ain’t tempting fate. always amazed me. It’s hard - “a” means “without” “pre” means before. “Without symptoms” vs. “before symptoms” like whaaaa challenging general US population? Remember said would stop talking election? world media written west always quick hype denounce everyone else results, regardless consequences Agreed. I'd feel confident anywhere US. whole situation made much worse. People also allergic carrots. worried that? people know vaccine ready January?

Yes course need go thru trials etc done fast still, literally made week sitting there.

No one credits Chinese scientist leaked genome sequencing made possible. happens 60 90 days going slow down? get it. huh problem ignorant history. headline exactly studies say, course obvious attracts interest (aka clickbait). Lockdowns slow spread stated third study, less stricter measures. would encourage anyone interested dig deeper know exactly distincion would data-driven model enabled extraction mobility characteristics crossed observed mortality rates show that: (1) time social distancing initiated utmost importance explains 62% number deaths, lockdown strictness duration informative; fuck SARS-ncov2, gonna die soon amount people going lie vaccine going equal amount assholes want wear mask around strangers.

We’re still gonna wear masks year, depending bad antivax community decides could even longer we’re free covid thought way.

The vaccine developed Germans.
They partnered US company trials, production, distribution.
That company received precisely $0 US federal government towards vaccine. 

Quite literally, thanks nothing. Money ultimate irony Yes, but... first vaccinated. healthcare professionals die COVID-19 already died.

2020 merciless. flip side, maybe keep people homes suppress virus bit. Pfizer's experimental model basically problems, among many others;

1.) Low reliability due self report; low test-retest reliability ie get results retest, low interrater reliability ie get different results depending upon person is, low intra rater reliability ie results rater different times. well complete subjectivity.

2.) Low validity; using indirect qualitative measures measure concrete discrete construct ie. low construct validity, reason sacrifice validity large scale clinical trial except maybe undue haste.

Validity well construct measured, reliability get results every time. Reliability coefficient validity, 80% reliable test max 80% validity. construct 80% valid first place...

Does make sense you? would prefer discount every single ounce humanity supposing every executive order passed directly detrimental American people one way another, none behalf him?  yeah live mountainous green region really didn’t understand concept hiking went college. 

it still blows mind people come walk around manicured trails fun. something makes sense country boy totally normal city dweller You’re assuming every single doctor researcher studying diseases dropped everything study covid. That’s accurate all. weep mankind, even covid ""over"" we're gonna somehow convince lunatics climate change real need clean damn oceans etc. 

COVID showed us science accomplish focused important issue incredibly well funded. also showed us fucking stupid, selfish, gullible, resistant change people are. Governments shown malicious incompetent again. see world could really fight environmental issues way need to. feel already lost. That's lot executions /S Yeah Tulsa race massacre one long works, US, freedom important lives. worst realizing exact people friends family. cant look way anymore. Dumbing much grasp really makes look stupid. hilariously true. love ppl angry lockdown never quarantine wear masks. Even better cops thing want enforce lockdown. yeah definitely 100% governors fault one elses. It’s normal people wary injecting new chemicals bodies. also reasonable people wait people gotten shot. It’s like leaders haven’t made short sighted decisions vaccinations before. skepticism today largely fueled 1976 flu vaccine debacle. hope keeping sane. planning months. Distribution won’t issue. think so? saw article Africa countries seem excellent virus. explained combination dealing ebola horrible virus past completely different immune system due diet/environmental factors might actually make easier them. lmao true. leave entitled LA gays act like it’s god given right get drunk every night week friends (who they’ve slept mind you) continue sex every attractive guy come across. know quite god they’re vapid miserable. entire pandemic roll eyes behavior watch proudly exhibit idiocy social media sane person question 'lockdowns'. government literally tells millions get fucked they're paying people dime. even work? long last? I'm absolutely anti vax question lockdowns lot might longer painful reaction experienced without chronic illness. hopefully chance longer life without covid risk makes worth it. I'm sorry make decisions health though. mother chronic pain always pain, vaccines always really tough her. hope hard opt get one day. tell people wear masks early months. wish could pass/fail students year. Grades keep intense pressure us (students, teachers, families) seems reckless time. extenuating circumstances, there's thing.

I've got approximately 50% failure rate among students, we've covered 1/3 - 1/2 would usually cover time.

I'm normal year failure rate 1-4%. travel Mississippi work temp housing manager I'm renting gave heads mask use ""is 40 percent really nobody seems care much everything still open want check casinos getting really bad things might little different arrive."" 

As someone traveling state governor gives shit we've closing places virus spreads easiest (and cities STILL 100 percent ICU capacity winter), really disheartening news. nothing politics. Although democrats take serious privilege. I'm registered nurse. get vaccine I've seen safely used least year. longer receive flu shots past 3 times gotten landed either hospital urgent care. 

I got flu shot I'm good health, go doctors appointments, chances getting it, extremely low.

But I'm sure find snarky way call idiot vaguely wish somehow contract I'm blindly ecstatic rushed vaccine everyone treating like miracle cure. tend want see shit gonna affect people en mass blindly  awful perspective

It’s rate equation push R less 1 burns out. 

The way forest fire put shovels hose lines slow spread burns don’t think Pfizer let buy right now, least said won’t ready. think US gov trying spend much money (that’s first), buying enough doses one vaccine won’t ready ones are. We’ve already seen Pfizer tell US won’t get doses Spring, point buying right now. health minister, Jens Spahn, said: “It’s clear need additional measures, rather sooner later. cannot allow festival virus. virus doesn’t care whether we’ve bought Christmas Appealing Germans show solidarity towards other, said: “The ‘us’ important ‘I’, means making Seehofer said “furious” Germany “thrown away advantage fought for” early pandemic, blaming lack discipline citizens, “insufficient measures Wednesday, chancellor, Angela Merkel, delivered unusually expressive appeal, voice breaking urged people stay home Christmas, risk seeing grandparents Merkel repeatedly called nationwide approach tackling coronavirus decisions made state basis, appeared ad hoc confusing.

It's sad situation Germany. There's mixture government officials deeply understand current crisis want take action crowd populists oppose work necessary manage pandemic, whether due capitalistic reasons ideological ones. repeated far large across continent. 

Germany started work managing community transmission, stopped early adopted poor habits neighbors. result, cases control way rest Europe. Merkel willing work, support enough government members make headway. people die. many countries even less willing work, far countries made stopping minimizing community transmission priority.  string attached close keep people safe covid. Thanks  Lots vaccine News coming FDAs announcement. question would nice someone help answer it: long immunity granted vaccine last? heard people talking boosters administered well makes lot sense.

Flu one many viruses people die from. People also die endemic coronaviruses. Flu isn’t particularly deadly, expend effort? agree said one thing add post days ago saying 2/3 adult population got vaccine vaccinate children. feel known (and correct sums comments seemed agree correct) might swing adults young children get subject children vaccine. good day us significantly lower infectivity rate empathy businesses majority vote representation won’t pass laws necessary provide level support times crisis.

Also 0.3% 50s seems wildly high. overall rate somewhere 0.5% - 1%. guy came mom's house work turned raving, full-on ""Bill Gates put tracking chips vaccines"" Covid denialist. started insisting Covid deaths actually flu deaths. Agree, wrong United kick considering parents wearing mask, companies causes people masks double views. They're brainwashed hoax conspiracy propaganda point. However long term problem they'll also likely refuse vaccine well, turn making hospitals still full. parties still perpetuators imperialism, though. needs go. I'm sure choose see media public stockholm right now, masks norm all. Life looks like old normal bars closing 10pm, course people surely taking common sense measures like reducing unnecessary personal contacts. really understand exercise. need equipment. things gyms closed. owned businesses, money bank, least year operating costs, fairly normal. shut 3 6 months result business going under, really business, hobby made money of. Lol get ready it’s coming, least if
You want travel internationally. people prior immunity current strain flu, also I'm assuming people getting flu shots Right? That’s I’m thinking first moved town, excited Dave &amp; Busters nearby. went disgusting. lot less 49% take account many people didn’t couldn’t vote. CDC says people infected may need get vaccinated know long immunity lasts either group yet. Nope. won’t change behavior you’d putting testers risk Meanwhile florida wide open doesnt even much Whatever feel comfortable Got positive pcr test Monday. negative rapid test Friday negative pcr test Friday. 

Tests seem pretty inaccurate. plenty people space work out/need PT train effectively/need use expensive machines medical/disability reasons need place escape couped inside. Gyms mental sanctuaries many people. top evidence spreading virus significantly. benefits gyms open far outweigh cons. Continue safety measures even increase restrictions necessary closing completely answer IMO. Saying ""JuST BuY PuLl Bar IdIoT"" plain ignorant. yes, still wear mask? so, long? decision critera stop social distancing / masks? # people vaccinated? 50% people vaccinated, 70% 80%? 

Considering hard get people take COVID masks seriously, imagine pushback people vaccinated. first statement- predicted beginning. It’s theoretical all. phrase way avoid “well week five people “ type arguments well lovely panic people find shit really real. 
Check back historical record year/ president gave real numbers early walked back. high estimates right range happen.

I think we'll okay next month getting past Christmas. least covid yet (that know of). became necessary destroy city order save it... French guy here, Macron announced vaccination free well! mean seen anyone thinks get 2 year old keep mask several hours delusional. 6% actually covid deaths I’ve seeing therapist 2 years now, crap still managed beat down.

If go 2 years this, I’m ending it. 2 years might easy you, it’s 16% lifetime, humans aren’t supposed live like this.

I mask social distance, second I’m going again. stay shut-in you’d like, rest us want over. plenty people space work out/need PT train effectively/need use expensive machines medical/disability reasons need place escape couped inside.

Bear mind there's also limited international flights, large conventions/meetings, huge drop many communal vectors contribute influenza spread.

Had done imagine bad coronavirus surge could get. guys really try EU doing. Capitalism, socialism sprinkled matters. arent going die. Shutdowns ordered without financial support, period.  Yeah honestly storm chasing Oklahoma Kansas would dream come true Tbf gym also refused use masks, financial stuggle going here. Well, sounding safer, figure speech. method tested decades course safer method never used humans. That's fact. doctor thus reading serious. knowledge judge understand laid out. know though there's definitely little testing new method.

I getting vaccinated seasonal flu, definitely covid, yet. enough science backing one able trust one moment. I'll re-evaluate 2-3 years later. Attempted murder legal form. hell goes way legalize something like that? “Risk” Trump status quo last four years maintained, honestly think even 10K would it. It'd something ridiculous, like maybe 80K - 100K. Republicans surprised far they're willing bleed. Really? realise vaccine released public FDA approved they've done extensive tests? fine. last 4 years proven many things assume government policies really courtesies typically broken. seriously suggesting take measures flu?

The flu animal reservoirs well, could distance mask like, unless want make permanent, flu endemic human population. Honestly hopes combination vaccine natural immunity. trend we’re time get summer could get herd immunity maybe 40% vaccine compliance. Scotland here. Getting support depends circumstances. self employed complex I'm surviving protecting family. Also business landlord nothing short amazing, norm.

I feel sorry people getting help. must brutal. Sure, reprimanded shitty/dangerous/hateful speech well within bounds law. Idaho based. It’s better 90% garbage states. we’ll much worse worry starts happening  World Health Organization actually stopped testing K-9s couple months ago. people still question: “WHO let dogs out?” too. It’s like one phrase everyone acts gangsta ________ shows up. country damned doom still don’t care. realize it’s real moment start flighting single breath. experience, good 80% people Walmart masked properly, 10% dicknose thing around chin lower lips like that's going anything, 10% without mask.

Vaccinated adults still carry transmit disease even vaccine works don’t get sick it. (I know vaccine isn’t 100%)

Why risk side effects children they’re rarely getting ill? risk might still transmit disease, currently are? There’s great benefit compared risk. Also, vaccine rationed probably 6 months adult population alone, wouldn’t ridiculous make adults wait kids would necessarily benefit it? (And adults wouldn’t necessarily benefit kids getting either.)

We’re going need mask long vaccines doled out. Kids resilient now. 

Clinical studies children chicken pox makes sense really dangerous illness children. high risk illness. goes polio measles such.

The scary part anti vaxers ruin shit everyone else long time. get vaccinated, still carry transmit Covid. refuse vaccinate risk catching us fellow anti vaxers. Like, we’re still going responsible mask protect assholes got us high death toll first place. knew selfishness could heavy? friends Taiwan say people wearing masks essentially, don’t to. time eradicate virus keep things relatively normal beginning chance spread soar level America. failed vaccines? information coming from? Well, one could get curbside communion without ever removing masks like get curbside cannabis, great. Why? thought virus really spread surfaces anyway? something change?   read side effects happen vaccine, large majority time happen within first couple months, years line. birth boom next two years. double positive impact social security. Let generation Alpha Beta deal it. I'm sketchy vaccine

So, ""opinions"", huh? good excuse start war wait more? ""objectively one worst"" world. merely subjective opinion, free course, try sell objective truth, not.

Your entire argument second third paragraph boils personal anecdotes people reddit, representative society large. talk people praising R&lt;1, almost different people different opinions? Again, bearing discussion.

If actual data show strategy OBJECTIVELY ""one worst"", I'd love see it. far I'm concerned, dust settled, point comparing countries. say someone critical FHM Tegnell. Worth risk

You mean inconvenience. know MRNA works body. long term effects MRNA would suffering MRNA already bodies. 
This stuff long term effects misleading. know individual ingredients act body. Mixing vial make ingredients. 
People make mistake thinking becuse know something biochemists know either.

POOF anything philosophically possible, real world possibility demonstrated far far glaucoma concerned. There's clearly enough evidence suggest there's high possibility COVID cause glaucoma, that's made hypothesis. direct link gyms open increase Covid cases? Otherwise, isn’t good reason shut down. Limit capacity, sure, shutting allowing big box stores remain open hypocritical simply anti scientific. It’s picking winners losers. Yeah bro 1200$ 5 months would really done something. Maybe ask mommy ps5 money instead absolute pathetic child. Wow. source this? makes sense thing Australia shutdowns per-state border closures etc, businesses open fine actually things get covid control. one state outbreak months, shut hard, eliminated it, open back up. I'm fairly sure businesses got support too.

A shut arguably better businesses shut down, actually done competent leadership states least this, even federal government wanted Trumpian. Though US might far gone. clearly need change system. pandemic federal level say. Merkel wanted shut nation already October. 

But stubborn prime ministers German states haven’t listen. ones able decided. Stupid. need loans, need money pocket, richest country earth, issue tell people enough resources us all, need cutthroat survive. stupid lie fed us wealthy. majority population followed rational scientific suggestions, mandates would ever needed. people want less mandates lockdowns, less dumb. much Germany run ICU beds.

We've run staff. retired Ob/Gyn wife (almost 70) gotten two letters Chamber Doctors asking come back work.

She least polite answer. give example person? can't say I'd interaction like anyone. similar frustrations think overall message be: tragedy regardless Reddit decides people deserve ""other side"". tragedy happens California, tragedy happens North Dakota. people follow guidelines CA people ND. fucking viral disease. anybody explain away seriousness anything? 

The question quite simple: ""No ICU beds means can't hospital?"" answer equally simple: ""They would start putting people stepdown units surgical wards, eventually available inpatient beds.""

Hopefully vaccinations wear cool masks ventilators....I heard pooped doesnt protect people vent.... people? also business owners. Sell business can't make money it. one keeps restaurant open ongoing massive flood.

Who's going buy gym right now? Like, earth would make anything think that's sound investment current state things? Yet America politicians (D R) taking away right people earn living zero due process going wear mask protect someone doesn’t want get it, sorry. don’t care. Also, time get we’ll know extent vaccinated people protected infection, disease, suspect protection infection pretty strong too. arrest owner Agreed. summer would eat outdoors, tried tip closer 1/3 40%. genuinely felt bad workers forced work Mostly Stockholm. failed region. region signed deal ended bought support stockings 500+ Euro piece. region extremely expensive new hospitals failed basic things. also scrap 20 million Euro system simple work.

For kids people special needs Sweden may best healthcare world. average Joe regions like Stockholm healthcare good. often miss basic things queue meet doctor long.

Wear care grandma dies. odds serious negative outcome virus orders magnitude higher vaccine, even considering chances never get infected. 

All approved vaccines tested tens thousands people. Even young healthy, odds hit hard virus worse that. Sure, wear mask vaccination. opinion however, average human not, thus unrealistic ask people. Yeah I’m sure gym owners thought long hard possibility pandemic closing opened businesses. /s  Read article? r/coronavirus mate. Tegnell claimed summer countries would worse Sweden strategy Sweden superior.

Do source particular statement, general interpretation made? sort perverse irony fast food places TGIChilliBees open takeout, gyms closed. think many places outside Hawaii closing outdoor spaces though. also suspect many ""JuSt PusHuPS HoMe"" crowd actually work spouting ass. like good news coming forth sprinkles.... Last step, swear! people 20s still need get vaccinated order stop spread virus. get jabbed, need keep wearing masks. flying fuck going buy business right now? inherently unprofitable matter owns it. right mind would buy it? even someone did, would extraordinary loss. business owner fucked financially matter do.  Well, you’re hair dresser Texas stay open, go jail less day run office. 🤦🏼‍♀️ local restaurant pivoted super fast carry out, created subscription service pay certain number meals month choose ones want menus month comes out. tipping policy begin paid waitstaff living wage. waitstaff runs meals cars, pretty well. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Good news indeed! 

The beginning end arrived! likely doesn’t. relates close viral code is. Covid seams “behave” appears closer SARS coronavirus cold. universally Without financial support, taking away Many Many people’s livelihoods telling “deal it.” People food eat roof heads. hospital beds statewide dropped 9% Thursday, 10% Wednesday

😳 States can’t run fiscal deficits

They sell bonds, really states can’t afford level support needed — federal government much larger tax base.

It’s also tough state borders porous. Can’t hard lockdown, eradicate disease open up, cases keep coming in. general population even worse one. many instead taking serious. Thank you! 2021 going great year! reason continue beyond pandemic.

From experience:

\-More say care act like ('cause freedom whatnot. many cases, can't bothered actually *do* anything help, e.g., masks.)

\-Many care tell sorts crap quoted article (it ""their time"", ""they're old."") close older relative vent long time. one family sister-in-law changed behavior. relative finally pulled released, began claiming survival he's ""real man"" crap like that.

FTFY That’s entirely accurate. Many people exercise physical health mental health. [Studies show exercise effectively manage depression without rely pharmaceuticals. Running outside 1-1 exchange whose mental health better managed lifting weights rather traditional cardio exercise. 

My anxiety increased significantly since gyms state ordered closed again. Lifting weights manages stress far better cardio. still exercising intensity—it’s possible without equipment don’t (and near impossible buy since March). 

So physical mental health suffer due one size fits approach mitigation plan. far capable mitigating risk, risk potentially pose others shut-down mandates can. gym/fitness center well executed enforced mitigation plan poses greater risk contracting/spreading virus shopping Walmart Saturday. Simultaneously, one able improve physical health reduces severe complications COVID. 

Risk hospitalization/death increase significantly population density, time contact, personal hygiene, age, underlying health conditions— factors exclusive gyms. Thank you! ""think"" ""ask"".

You put medical care hands medical care professional leave work them. Reddit zero sympathy. pass blame without addressing fact many people losing jobs livelihoods. idea gets us back normal, know it’s vaccine approved itself. People saying months vaccine life normal. state setting sites week, life’s going normal. No. actually means support Lockdowns Financial Aid tandem US, citizens unfortunately smart enough work. people wearing masks trying right thing though. idiots loudness makes seem plentiful are.   post stupid it’s unbelievable.

This virus already killed 300k people country 16m cases. That’s 2%, .02%. .02% 16m would 3200 people. 2% part don’t hospitals 100% capacity like see almost everywhere soon.

Also, flu killed 34,000 didn’t shut everything down. Covid killed 304k majority country wearing masks shut year. can’t see difference you’re fucking idiot. People losing livelihoods results deaths well.

At rate? guess ozone hole Australia finally shown purpose. know chicken pox vaccine doesn’t provide sterilizing immunity either nothing stop it’s spread itself? bet didn’t. [And deaths chicken pox dropped dramatically around 50% vaccination rate. sterilizing immunity needed herd immunity, reach herd immunity chicken pox ~50% vaccination rate vaccine didn’t provide sterilizing immunity? 

Because it’s required, COVID vaccine roll much faster, there’s evidence suggest people vaccine clear virus quickly. Also course face coverings keeping hands clean!

Now need paraphrase rest title?  Thank you. ate inside September, point stuff *has* open people do. Well support lockdowns, least US, financial support. Society isnt gonna shutdown viruses eradicated. Pointing areas gyms locked smart people avoiding good place look genuine evidence spread rate.

The virus airborne. Gyms indoors, full people aerosolizing grunts, panting, yes, even talking shouting.

Unsurprisingly, like choir practice, gyms indeed source superspreader events:

1 asymptomatic instructor passed 8 instructors, passed 112 people US following ""open up, safely"" direction, think could make strong case activities conditions. Spread weightlifting garage doors open box fans pushing lot airflow? Great! Spin class small cramped room 30 people? f-ing way. talking PPP?

Look forgiveness guidelines - majority funds used pay employees exceptions around HCE. Yes way. Maybe force people controlling things (ie McConnell neoliberals) right thing start getting 10k dead per day feel bad, businesses got big handouts government back stimulus released. Problem lot businesses use money instructed, instance neighbor got 2.2 million (he several massage parlors). Instead using funds payroll purposes ended closing shop firing employees. went shopping spree untill feds caught going he's jail. mean feel bad types business owners trying cash in? 

Also take consideration businesses quite well really pay taxes Trump admin least 3 years meaning able pocket extra cash Tax Breaks yet somehow claim broke. best friend told covid vaccine doesn’t exist. got upset couldn’t see person. Precisely get flu shot every year. Never side-effect.

To headline reads like ""Coke sugar bike rides"" Considering already dropping like flies is, probably best interest drug marvelously trials made available us time need most. Thankfully consensus important one opinion situation. I'm thinking workload Isolate. aren’t taking seriously live try best isolate within household. test earlier week negative days later positive, false negatives happen. Sorry bigger person. Thank you. long give priority groups get vaccine? need delay things convince hesitant? Always lead. Never going stop. Go USA


Fuck!!! Yeah, definitely give employers blanket immunity COVID liability. one would abuse it. /s Wait. plan since March? Gee, get mean one large benefit certainly doses allowed used EUAs. I’d rather two manufacturers producing vaccines one. isn’t worry might long-term side effects vaccine aren’t apparent years vaccination? Congrats thank do! us can’t afford keep financially supporting everyone. swear people thinks money grows trees government. US already added 5-6 *trillion* dollars national debt year guys wanna spend more??? good fucking luck taxes everyone! Well maybe stop fucking electing republicans. republican party party suited modern era. also dynamics. example young children higher chance transmitting flu Covid-19  Well put! local gym selling items living fine. owners pregnant surviving well. They’re also zoom private training fitness classes $50 hour well. bad allergies suppressed immune system.

What everyone telling listen doctors. Follow advice letter. States going this. 9/11 blown way proportion. Covid even top cause death US making bubonic plague. People dying world variety reasons. Try mitigate it, let's pretend world ending. literally putting money saving lives

For people country, make money months, lives effectively over. 

So really simple. 

If given choice going broke/being evicted catching covid, people going take chances covid... CDC approve vaccine tomorrow vaccinations officially start. can't stand liability clause. live Florida work mask mandated catch covid people care can't sue making work unsafe environment? Yes recovered it, symptoms temporary.  that’s problem. Contact transmission small part problem long people don’t touch face. problem people breathing subsequently people breathing in. you’re wearing mask, highest possibility spread totally uneffected measures mentioned. videos China already back February right ? people seen think change thing.

Careful people stay careful, stupid people stay stupid. yeah they’re paying 40% tax next 10 years pay spending Even cops regular inspections. going notice someone parking street going someone's house.

Outside parties loud music, idea logistically enforce it.

Even states provinces snitch lines seeing decrease cases. fair, need adjust number excess deaths number expected flu deaths year wish widespread referencing polio, Asian flu Honk Kong flu. early vaccine fail one pandemics. Maybe China ready determined novel coronavirus, latter two centred region. Curbside pickup delivery doesn’t work fucking fitness center. still income business. complicit grew complacent pursuing employment took administrative burden hands, willing accept less money compensation exchange. growing regulations profession pushed many older independent physicians employed section workforce, became much keep with. 

Then also consider AAMC, accrediting body medical schools, hospitals member organizations medical schools, definitely shaped medical curriculum. Medical schools classes public health, don’t classes administration, management, business. Chiropractors learn business professional school curriculum. money comes mostly followers. keep donating, buying books financing rallies. least Germany. That's think least ""rebel leaders"" mostly money (or grudges former employers). term people believe vaccine.

So term attach getting vaccine only? ones think head, I'd like one suitable public use. want stop paying federal income tax wtf even me? fuck representation Turtle McFuckface sit legislation would help fucking money? I'll make easy enact private citizen executive order redirect funds paycheck going fed back account. Fuck them. wish California would grow balls same.

Bloody poop horrible. real tragedy correct answer. Finger pointing help ""Spanish"" flu, help now. study finds people vaccinated Flu 30% less likely catch die COVID-19.

This people get vaccinated generally careful health, avoid catching virus. likely take precautions, hand washing, mask wearing obeying social distancing measures.

It's self evident anti-vaccine folks also less likely want wear masks, anything told. Honestly good lab shepherd would able same. farmer train dog fetch odor 3x/week 6 months I’m waiting stories old fashioned holdups like old West days. packages “lost.”

Multiple others developed US. mean, different countries world tried different things. Unless every country suddenly turned small island like New Zealand, realtively low population density, severe restrictions followed while... we're basically screwed without vaccine. 

Sweden's approach work, Germany's approach work, Japan's approach work. three main approaches: herd immunity (without enforced restrictions); hard lockdown progressive reopening; half half. control everywhere, there's still lot people infected.

I personally see realistic way out. think either vaccines, deaths economic collapse.

Besides, think risk Covid higher risk taking vaccine. Covid pretty high chance killing someone, long-lasting effects well. Even individualistic point view, getting vaccine makes sense me.

And, all, scientists know lot vaccines say safer vaccinated not, way know better. formal training, able make one judge one.

So I'm trusting this, too. I'll take deem fit, we'll see go there. Hopefully 2021 regain normalcy. businesses pushing back ones never endorsed masks, minimum safety. deserve shut down. feel bad businesses got shut taking seriously.

Lol it’s pretty easy understand they’re like [archive link anyone trouble accessing article plenty articles state evidence support vaccine stop catching spreading virus. vaccines merely designed (hopefully) prevent getting severe case. stop getting Covid.

Yeah, except China socialist dictatorship controls media. free journalists publish scathing articles critical government without fear reprisal. free journalists scientific evidence suggests originated China.

And cares? Unless China's fault (I believe was), cares? China trying rewrite history? thing China guilty trying deal virus clandestine way. Instead open honest, hid lots details knew hoping hurt economy. led unmistakable fact allowed virus spread unchallenged guilty negligence handling it. open honest, nobody would blamed them.

And yet China acts like younger brother chip shoulder trying gaslight us history revisionism. solid majority people know clearly China's fuckup, succeeding making look worse.

its think may wrong, they've lost big picture. Worst case, right. vaccine phase 3 testing, thousands taken it. wait 2 months, see non-fatal side effect 5%. what? Turn vaccine, wait next one phase 3 trials, wait another two months? 300,000 deaths later, new vaccine. better outcome? perfectionist's mindset.  alright US use picture victim. case showing even thumbnail. make sure you’re injecting vessel. follow proper sharps procedures confirmed infections. certain point May became tribal entrenchment around masks, Osterholm’s apparent dissension CDC’s position caught whirlwind. mask issue became defining stance, albeit garbled message, clear, never anti-mask, homemade cloth even medical-grade surgical masks offer empirical protection N95, currently reserved specialized uses settings. Homemade masks idiosyncratic, though potentially effective, means diminishing transmission, license carefree trip Lunds somebody [...] Osterholm’s refusal hide ambivalence masks turned unintentional iconoclast [...]

My view March was: get mask - MASK - wear it. scheme get even better mask. Osterholm showed late masks generally, mumbled message wen did. PPP loans gave small businesses 8 weeks employee pay basically. 9 months ago now.

That's great keep employees employee back 8 weeks obviously gone longer eight weeks business expenses business es getting help for?

There’s going be, minimum, 25m vaccinated end January. Assuming country vaccinated people intelligently targets high risk groups need to, already enough vaccines stop 60% deaths assuming prioritize people 70. 

Imagine deaths we’re seeing subtract 60% them. we’re midst largest increase US right now. wave subsides, still knock 60% deaths off. seemingly nonexistent slow periods pandemic next 6 months. That’s good bad. 

But mostly good. Look situation improve even heading March. individual risk going without mask vaccine soon become dangerous collective risk weird way.

This refrain eating public places. Sure, safeguards like distancing plastic barriers etc., inherent risk presence others without masks sufficient ventilation still there.

Most importantly? Accidents happen. gave consent parent/guardian. stage consent involved, definitely factor. adults ask directly. 16 year old goes get vaccinated, would need spend extra time obtaining parental consent, slows whole process. obviously insurmountable problem, complicate things already complicated chain distribution. 

More that, though, there's legal issue. Minors cannot consent. someone give 16 year old vaccine without parental consent, sued possibly lose license adverse effects. question directed at,but yes far experts saying people infected get vaccinated too,since immunity getting infection last long (about 3 months) whereas immunity vaccine hopefully longer that.

But:If half population dies vaccine finished, dont worry buying presents parents.

Everyone. Wear mask. Keep 6 feet+ distance eachother whenever can.

That's average age death unconstitutional mandate? Yes, absolutely fight it. Fuck you.  country genre deserve talented artists like Charley Pride. keep dip spitting hicks like hank jr. Horrible people subreddit. Someone dies, deserve person happened agree asinine lockdowns. 

The true nature many pro-lockdowners apparent, actually cares human life, wouldn’t celebrating someone’s death disagreeing (among many things course). Lloyd's London really insurance company, market. underwriters (corporations rich people, called 'Names' members) refuse pay out. Usually insurance company use go Lloyd's find Names/members underwrite contracts. 

A small insurance company likely go large insurance company go Lloyd's, 'Names' underwrite everything. bunch middlemen. fact, Lloyd's layers middlemen, managing agents, agents, members ('Names), coverholders, brokers. take little top.

In 90s, due asbestos liability, bunch 'Names' went bankrupt, many unlimited liability. pool much exposure apparently 2% days, underwriters forced cover pandemic losses, we'll likely see hundred billionaires lose shirts. We're breaking conditioning.  No, would recommend contact recent close contacts give heads up. bad anyone position power could help support businesses. guess would socialism, though. would go business owner likely. 

If he’s set LLC pierced corporate veil go business accounts assets. Assuming rents building space leases equipment likely tangible property seize. Assuming virus hit business hard also probably cash poor. 


If gym similar business set likely point send sheriff shut business down. take court seize assets. discovery attempt get full financial picture. time file bankruptcy. bankruptcy state levy him. show nothing state/ creditors end nothing. practice work *people*. government could give $10k week everyone still people going giant parties without masks spraying spittle screaming virus real.

If everyone stayed home original short lockdowns worn masks whenever possible acted responsibly socializing needed much assistance first stimulus checks, things would've fine manageable everyone could go usual. There'd still cases, spreading uncontrollably. reason continue closures many mask-fearing idiots (same goes Europe, they're struggling too).

All takes one look [a country like Hong Kong (where people actually commit wearing masks already normalized COVID) see point failure is. Government also failing us now, put position fail us populace damn stupid selfish. Early year, government Germany anything covid health minister telling us worry since similar flu (I'm kidding you), guys quick demand strong government action.

Turns right one time, government actually started something, quickly changed minds became ""lateral thinkers"". No. I'm introverted optimist. socially distance, wear mask, that. realist optimist, realist pessimist.

You'd blind see doom gloom sub.

My dad passed away year (not Covid) like world hunky dory, many folks really seen revel awful. opinion, may differ. First mean it’s clear cut others saying legal system won’t allow done. You’ve (and others) making statement. 

Secondly ends discussion laws could passed summer. laws could passed right now. letting law passed earlier year expire May. show lots could done. Lots could done. pass law. 
But Tegnell told everyone wouldn’t 2nd wave Sweden. everyone else would one Sweden. 
It’s really tragic. don’t understand defend health officials politicians. UPS FedEx play nice, know shit going down. Oh no, blame Sweden that, though blame occasional Swedish commenter bends backwards defend charge - here. He'll probably able rebuy pennies dollar auction, lol. don’t see reason unless like don’t pto get covid pay work quarantine need positive test. Maybe look getting antibody test later! explain bit formula? I'm bit slow things. get double digits chance? That's said **rich** business owners specifically. ... batshit crazy antivaxxers get way.

There. fixed him. people don’t deserve vaccine surplus I'd last person argue Australia US shining beacon human rights. detain asylum seekers arriving boat. detention 10 years without accused crime. 

Being asked stay home middle deadly health crisis killed hundreds thousands completely reasonable. even pay people $2600 per month so. sane person shows terrifying Covid is. Higher death rate, far contagious, spreads much easier cripples hospital capacity. fact simple mask wearing seeing flu rates nosedive Covid still exponentially rising basic gatherings terrifying. Government can't allowed actively long-term suspend ""free-market capitalism"" whim(or political agenda) something microscopic (relatively speaking) mortality rate institute manner socialistic welfare. Pandemic insurance huh, good know there's insurance elected officials decide feel like breaking entire world's economy.. I'm sure many people never realized needed thing, shame them.. true free-market capitalism state fed gets take risks business where. business owners consumers. state becomes actual risk business.. well see going.. No, fuck off. Rigged economy so? possible level virus system changed time? Also realize one person's experience cannot demonstrate level test accuracy right? Time educate masses. think everyone works charity volunteering time..? Technically trillion closed businesses, too.

$669 billion small businesses PPP, $500 billion aid large businesses. $300 billion direct payments taxpayers.

Not enough, zilch. needing money live seems escape lot liberal elite.

Just learn code. /s Fair enough. However, figure obvious things figured here. Koch brother requiring anything. People could support kids. say everyone, kinda figure people following along there. Regardless, add three zeros have. Either way, logistically possible dude single-handedly end poverty U.S. still make enough himself. uses money pet projects policies benefit personally. And, really could afford borrow difference. owns much capital. gave away twice already. That's ridiculous ancient patents are.  unironically sucks wait long new administration take over. wish Trump would hand now. Damn, that's really interesting. 

I sat around TV family extremely sobering moment - watching people die alone w/o loved ones. might knock sense people. Give example, we've go n95s now, they're fit tested right us. switched styles hospital new supplier. I'm big dude, suddenly ""normal size"" n95 riding mouth I'm admitting new covid patient. seal there, eating thing supposed protecting me. I'm ICU ER, regular telemetry nurse covid patients last 4 weeks. Hopefully gotten incident vaccine still work knows. Exactly. lol (lots love) honestly don’t understand everyone masks. Especially wear transport shopping/in close contact others. What’s big deal? obviously opened weren’t shut time went. sure tell except fact open, I’m sure long open. risk distributed evenly population might true, luckily it’s not. vast majority benefit via vaccination 70, small percentage total population. 

Once population covered death rates plummet concerns hospital overwhelm relevant. idea nothing change hit 70% population isn’t backed anything. How’s death rate there? wait showing symptoms late already spread it. like Covid, people asymptomatic flu contagious, well symptomatic people contagious developing symptoms. 

Wearing masks public social distancing needs new normal. else return go old normal tens thousands people die every year easily preventable illness. article nothing sort. test positive 90 days first bout covid. Reinfection extremely rare. long term effects actual covid worry vaccine. coworkers seem divided. long give priority groups get vaccine?


Given temp requirements may time, case opened twice day one minute per opening. Healthcare workers need take appropriate amount vaccine twice day, meaning carefully calibrating taking little risk sending patients home, taking much risk wasting limited Yes. said word starts K. Im going get Monday yes Im american. It’s misinformation. look comment thread. People can’t trusted make decisions... add hundred thousand deaths. hero time get people wear mask March lying saying masks effective prevent hoarding medical grade masks. time cloth would better nothing given anti mask folks less ammo. think aus/nz maybe Hong Kong, Mainland China Japan SK no. SE asia probably mixed. Coward country? That's unnecessarily condescending. say going ask? relevant -- stated, I'm already disqualified -- cannot get due reaction previous vaccine left ICU. 

It's already said no-go people reactions previous vaccines, publicly, people allergies, according UK. Israel excluded people biologic therapy, think obvious going. 

Congratulations acting like people chronic health conditions know bodies, though. Great gatekeeping. worst impacted state spammed propaganda lockdown killing economy.

They also complained walked every street affluent suburb 5km travel restriction harsh Please feel free supply said numbers perusal, then. OoOoh look everyone, reddit rando says MaJoR PrObLeM you.

Lmao, get it, shit person. People kids outside responsibilities. can't tell people work regular job, ""hey, live work 3 months now."" That's fucking insane. Yes, let's mourn aswell. Good idea! know point though. bring great point, thank you! agree, also think it’s little bit both; Japan (and much Asia) good model happens people things like mask wearing, social distancing, etc. order protect public whole. It’s pretty common practice. 

Thanks bringing up! People also seem reading vaccine won’t do, long take vaccinate everyone world wants one. many people planning jet straight countries take get shots, even countries might get vaccines till 2022. I'm envisioning pigs wearing little masks kind adorable. 

Also, hope see uptick influenza deaths things start go back normal. lack enforcement disappoints it. point rule enforced Hope stay way.   Sucks mate, people wearing masks malls, stores, gyms? Plus it’ll really difficult get loan mortgage. doubt banks would clamoring give money he’s trying open new business that’s exactly like old one went bankrupt. consider treasonous get extent character. need won’t there’s nothing Well think know people view 9/11 worse 3000 people dying:

Keep mind 9/11 could actually see it. could see fire, twin towers, rubble, debris, bodies, people panicking, overall destruction. 

Meanwhile, Covid, everything raw statistics. actually showed people beds suffering Covid think people would treat threat Take first $2.2 trillion stimulus package. That's $2,200,000,000,000. Suppose 320 million Americans. That's enough give everybody, man, woman, child $6,875. Alternatively, 123 million households, that's enough give every household $17,886. first stimulus checks $600. FUCK money going? Well I've going gym since August 3 4 days week anyone gym covid. really comes fact republicans don’t think people deserve help, businesses deserve help. 

Why even businesses? make money people survive. businesses important sense vehicle provides human life. 

Save PEOPLE businesses back normal soon enough. Save businesses poor people die. 

We ass backwards. care fetuses, didn’t ya know? I'm saying need close \*for time shit control\*. never said anything permanent closing, please put words mouth. Furthermore, kids, kids act like (I'm way damn awkward relationship long) concern. laugh karma like strikes. belief. easily provable fact. Newsom shutdown indoor dining statewide June. never reopened LA county. 

There rogue places defied order, shut county officials home country's citizens bad, honestly know explosion cases right now. things story I’ve never understood part legal You’re right though. They’ve released suffering. anti-lockdown mean denying virus exists.

I extremely anti-lockdown. course don’t want die. fact, think anyone supports lockdowns lot answer for, terms concern human life. fact believe person’s death “karma,” lockdowns shows much care human life.

Lockdowns horrible disastrous policy decisions. Possibly worst 21st century. Pointing fact equal wishing death. ""wait, still wearing mask? think is, April?"" would think probably animal reservoirs. I.E. Pigs birds social distancing wearing masks. would likely need wear masks social distance forever maintain low flu numbers.  tragic circumstance happened. think many people ignorant, reckless, and/or uninformed COVID-19. hand, many not.... example: 
   
For December 12 3:00 EST, Johns Hopkins University [Cases mortality section reporting among 171 countries highest COVID-19 death counts per 100K population, #1 Belgium (pop. [11.6 highest 154.89/100K. contrast, #13 United States (pop. [331.9 90.31/100K, Taiwan (pop. [23.8 lowest 0.03/100K. 
          man dressed Saint-Nicholas feel ill prior visit.  
  
UC Health, Nov. 5, 2020: show 50% people, nearly 40% children age 6-13 years, tested positive COVID-19 asymptomatic. Asymptomatic adults children spread SARS-CoV-2 virus others.
    
CDC, November 20, 2020: ""Masks primarily intended reduce emission virus-laden droplets (“source control”), especially relevant asymptomatic presymptomatic infected wearers feel well may unaware infectiousness others, estimated account [more transmissions."" used humans. take advice reading studies. whole thing really bad going worse. I’m self employed really tried go book. didn’t get unemployment help went right one time stimulus. 

I’m sitting like 17$. utilities waaaaay behind, Car payment late, meh. SUCKS!!! Well one less coz ded Unless they’re ones getting assistance Patience virtue. relaxing break [at last month. fearful catching it, despite people wearing masks. There’s lady could smell Parkinson’s husband it.  Again, gyms resturants 'open' 50% capacity (forgot add that), attendance low due safety concerns, least businesses making money. Anyone point still ""needs proof"" effectiveness masks social distancing, clearly susceptible proof form evidence, peer reviewed studies, anything else.

I suspect travel restrictions matter lot too: less flu coming countries. Or, y’know, civic duty. That's OP said. that, that's OP asked.

Words meaning. ""join echo chamber rife confirmation bias populated hypochondriacs"" ""why suffer due virus affects people 90 years old already chemo?""

It seems like people consistently say virus dangerous doctors scientists, hell would know? Florida? know governor said municipalities allowed mask mandates I'm sure they'll implement safeguards soon finish making sure businesses can't held liable issues covid.  that’s it. like “an irresponsible minority” Except say masks effective. said cloth masks make risk 0%, 100% factual. 

There huge difference. Well first no...but testing facilities expanded greatly, height pandemic equivilent US 50K cases day. There's argument know young child can't keep mask duration find alternative commercial flights.

Though I'm pretty sympathetic situation. kid months younger would fall 'under two' exception. would've fine staying on. really 'banned United life' (which really believe unless story) seems really stupid. irony effect follows cause expected? don’t understand isn’t reported US. starting happen everywhere. people left work pandemic *and* cover left thing drives nuts people actually believe government conspiracy. Like seriously government stupid enough shoot feet control population? Like honestly gain ruining economy? fact entire world would willing destroy economies well populace patently ridiculous. 

I'm laid second time yet instead taking personal responsibility conservatives state yell ""Fuck Inslee."" highly doubt guy wants watch state burn. He's trying keep constituents safe. conservative pushback rolled back phase 1 restrictions terms Bars such. real issue people getting mad wear mask literally least do. fact government can't stop bickering everything long enough help people pathetic indicative much felt impact. 

In conclusion support shutdowns, support ignoring people businesses suffering, could play along wear mask taken care much easier. one trying take rights away. see far fines wearing mask. wanted take rights away absolutely shoot foot so. yup! capitalism always race bottom. Tech AI combined capitalism going absolute disaster. late join DSA! people deliberately obstruct efforts help people. CRAZIEST coincidence! Amen!! money get indeed based income last year result people fired planning grow suddenly slow down.

Getting even say, 90% income last year stimulus still results fire people hired new team period closings. Happened one costumers. organizes parties, growing business(15 employees) wanted expand. Hired people. Corona hit.

Most people keep job course.  love people act like can’t pay people literally dozens countries paying people stay home. Tens thousands people already gotten Pfizer Moderna vaccines many months ago. That's testings for. Tests really 100 percent accurate, that's getting at. dogs devote something like 1/3 brains scent processing? Dont go gym? Idk people acting like gym required membership don’t know why. US vaccinates 150 million people flu months every year. got flu shot cvs, open slots every 10 minutes day - walked within hour. There’s shortage people qualified give shot. anyway Please see one many replies type comment. Vaccine timelines mainly waiting, ""10 years studies"" sounds like lot, always compressed towards end anyways, generally 1-4 years. Ever notice people wearing masks ones would benefit most? Stupid ugly. Well yes, Hahn lying here. Nakedly. multiple reports certification expected Saturday, yesterday reported Trump told Hahn certify EOD he's fired, certification comes late Friday night, we're supposed believe reports White House interference inaccurate? Bullshit. Hahn lying. he's jeopardizing credibility FDA vaccine caving political pressure lying it.  Found watch people die. love hanging mean deaths less income. Going sell lot extra protein bars make one! Love see nursing major got connections going huge parties every weekend.... Yes, New York 1.4% transmissions coming indoor dining. 3/4 living together indoors. 

... ban indoor dining. They'll shut local retail store, shut Amazon warehouse. can't deny people basic right make living. article:
“Viruses produce odours. virus infected cells, knock-on effect various systems within body, results odours released skin breath. really strong likelihood coronavirus would produce distinct odour well.”

So think harms them. followed trajectory tee ! bad. It’s normal flu. forgot. 300K die every year flu annual national shut down. true. opportunity 10 years studies time people dropping like flies around globe""

If put 12 recently pregnant women room month, years worth observation, long term study. Typically patients clinical events around 280 days so. years worth observation would catch that.

I agree vaccination, immune responses general, respond shorter time scales, safety tested. ""10 years studies"" really valid claim. gym keep charging members closed, state this. open close forever. know happened small businesses loans working. I'd love go wet sauna right now... God damnit. Sorry, comment written clearly all. see reference one world government, last two questions seem rhetorical, cannot tell point supposed make. lack clarity may getting downvoted. clarify? told members long chant ""CCP virus"" entering place. virus stay away them. get half mask respirator put cloth mask vent. Works great actually protects you. Easily available days Amazon.

They're designed industrial work. Sweat uncomfortable, exercise well worth uncomfortable first place. Gotta love german efficiency ""White House orders FDA chief authorize Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Friday submit resignation.""

 talking vaccine right? Pretty well gym. People hesitant new vaccine =\= anti-vaxxer cases

You’re bad person little concern new vaccine created record time. Sorry remember exactly time. That's it, Smalls! Maybe grudge Pfizer then. knows stopped working there. 
All Yeadon, Wodarg Bhakdi, following denial agenda followers care statements scientific false. people confirming belief that's need. Im waiting article says Pfizer repositioned vaccine selling treatment erectile dysfunction.  makes sense don’t pay rent, business gets shut immediately vacate premises. 

However, don’t immediately pay fines. Best strategy would stay open, bite fines, pay rent, make whatever income can. pandemic nuke business, let gov fines dissipate since business longer exists, open new gym different person’s name voila. fuck start last night?? valid? agree it? agree businesses financial support shutdowns, literally putting money saving lives. side valid support shutdown even without financial support regardless. That’s really lot anti-lockdown talk fallen flat California. Throwing Newsom like anyone gives shit. understanding state’s situation, capacity action, hit/miss willingness get job done. 

Being anti-lockdown throwing failures doesn’t accomplish anything... want someone better Newsom, someone gonna shrug enormity situation go catch COVID (like see repeatedly country leaders falling short leadership positions). going play 2 festivals year.. Granted nowhere big two, yea feel pain. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses chimpanzee adenovirus vector. virus part DNA codes replication removed replaced coding instructs cells make SARS-COV2 spike protein.  much bunch people? You’re making nebulous pronouncements awful public health messaging throughout pandemic Bc fkn ‘Merica. love country feel blessed time. But...we fkn stupid. watched interview FDA panel member andshe explained something like 23 individuals trial became pregnant trial run although seem fine far enough data get FDA stamp safety. I’m pharmacist industry starting allow technicians administer vaccines, much opposition. technique complicated. complicated part identifying eligible, (due age, disease states, contraindications, allergies, etc.), something goes wrong. trustworthy, well trained health care provider immunizations something consumer seek take granted He's sovereign citizen. makes sense. mean, worked great, right? Almost!?!?!!! Right. Anyone needs go hospital state subject triage seems.

Anything operation put next coming months bet covid 19 firestorm slows lot. catch states ones initiating shutdowns, good reasons, states simply type funds. strapped cash is, many even enough money distribute vaccine. funding support needs come federal government interest so. Atilis What? schools, something Sweden actually got pretty right (whatever think rest strategy). least according Europe (including successful Nordic countries) - driving pandemic much worth close down, compared damaging kids. Norway's Finland's strategy schools failure SK Singapore well? arguing countries schools open? Sweden bad? Talking bad faith... Lol again, I'm really guessing. also seems like bragging intend flagrantly disregard lawful order declare bankruptcy avoid fines would used legal effort get money. Facebook protected privilege said deaths metric determine stop wearing masks. Oh no

I'm sad that

Damn even state workers NJ, hardest hit state. could change, right now, told cannot forced take vaccine.   makes think covid go away? trying rude understand reasoning behind masks. sub roasts anti maskers thing?  That's crazy, denmark currently testing 100,000 day population 6 million. LA County continues disappoint me. wtf waiting for? shut everything now! stimulus not. people office really naive. historic stats present?

Our hospitals nowhere close full case transmission plateaued  2020 several hundred times less likely

""isnt large"" misleading. ""Airplanes much safer cars, cars number people killed much larger."" mentioned ""problem"", admit risk small number happens bigger much smaller number. That's problem. Finally...we’re finally seeing end tunnel. long, long list things plan I’m vaccinated He's one blocking financial support would prevent business assets gobbled large, inherently sociopathic corporations.

Corporations explicitly choosing money lives entire pandemic. Fuck true. right. That's unfortunate calculus. stadium 10,000 people, way make living required one 10,000 people died, would really choose bankruptcy loss current lifestyle? 

Maybe would. nation hundreds millions people, surprising plenty people would choose kill one ten thousand maintain livelihoods? Hell, plenty would make choice drink bar post Instagram!

This situation requires smart strong national leadership...but ain't coming weeks. option hang there. want thank everyone involved recall is.  Donald Trump talking ass second debate asked vaccine. 6 months data right 44k phase 3 trial. Phase 3 trials 1-4 years. shorter time frame, much looks surface. enhances point judge specified, obviously. OMG! deaths PER DAY 9-11 60 90 days!

The whole damn world changed 9-11 yet one 9-11 death count daily months government's horrendous criminal inaction!

This truly crime humanity imo!  Nah bro, wait seconds grab flag Here’s hoping make 10k+ normal daily operating cost. Closing gyms parks foolish decisions resulted Americans gaining 8-15lbs average. It’s shown proven sanitize use. Cleaner definitely not, safer covid ... probably. Gyms spend long amounts time stationary, lot less space move around. people much less likely follow protocols working breath. realize it’s far nazi idea private businesses set rules allow properties. don’t think stores anything, think sports leagues large venues may create rules. Airlines already talking it. Vaccines required attend school decades expect Covid vaccines added existing lists years. taking care oneself. genes also. course, li e life matter lot  flu much less COVID notable amount, means measures take stop COVID like mask wearing social distancing multiple-fold even effective flu. causing us much lighter flu season usual, turn causing conspiracy people say ""why many fewer flu cases year - bet covid cases actually flu they're covering up."" le sigh... suppose also want economy shut every year flu season. 

Or deaths acceptable you? Missed point again. Keep trying dumbass.  bad metric, one point majority people didn’t consider groups people human. Majority rule can’t trample minority rights. It’s also laughable believe government represents majority people anyway. Pity? plenty people prison *do not* deserve die there. people wait years jail court case cannot afford bail. 

Additionally, COVID outbreaks prison responsible worst outbreaks surrounding area. due guards staff taking virus home them, also due prisoners getting released they’ve served time. Placing higher priority vaccinating prisoners good way reduce risk everyone else local area, many rural areas far less access high-quality medical care. This. Security theater abundant since beginning attract business. Businesses left right like ""We wipe everything multiple times day. require masks. square dancing class safe."" 

No. safe. suck business trouble? yes. Business owners took risk though. Black swan events like covid happen continue happen. Sometimes isnt good remedy things going turn bad. It’s also easy say support don’t support shutdowns businesses need eat, too.

You know what? without shutdowns, businesses failing. Everyone block pulling 25%-40% capacity. People aren’t dining out. Businesses needed help 8 months ago. much Rona going Austin WAIT.

Facebook took county COVID pages fake news?!?!

And wonder people won’t take covid seriously. people live infected. ""The first doses Covid vaccine will arrive 145 locations across US Monday, said Army general Gus Perna, runs government’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine distribution program.

If politician hems haws covid relief never said anything spending $2million launch cruise missile goat hearder, need ignored. Remember things got mostly back normal summer (and backfired causing small wave)?

Imagine 20-80% population either natural vaccination immunity. back normal summer. risk come carry behavior fall winter hope immunity levels still high enough keep R&lt;&lt;1. much smaller difference difference deaths. 

People might think ""ah, situation fine, fewer dying, fuck restrictions"" spring could lead overwhelmed hospitals. ""Shutting restaurants bars places people take masks important, absolutely contributes spread, gives license people interact households""


So care starving essential workers called truck drivers, people without model staying home receiving deliveries collapses? hope realize truck drivers vanishingly little zero interaction households.

But fair love virtue signaling. I'm sure downvoted. time business takes expense competitors don't, competitive disadvantage. That's idiotic block government action -- applicable everyone -- opt businesses right thing. right thing socially often wrong thing business-wise. That's sucks capitalism. stupidity amazes me. Okay number infections/deaths would deem acceptable wear mask anymore? Essential workers kept us fed risked health every day throughout ordeal. I’m getting vaccine priority. People 65 likely retired also able afford stay in. goodness, annoying I'm done conversation. 

I'm saying people CAN'T take take it. Obviously. even know going this, tangents place. nice day. I’m little confused, difference flu Covid would completely keep people getting flu completely keep people getting Covid?

Are Covid particles smaller? Longer lasting? Common sense guidelines...socially distance, wear masks allow people accept risk choose. I'm American, dont give shit  get approved “I won’t take vaccine rushed” “I don’t trust current administration” undertone trying work richest nation world can't even help people. corporation, getting bailed Essential workers gotta drive work. I’m going oppose gym staying open gym asked close provided safety net financial help. Lockdown without support directly kill people. Hard avoid getting COVID homeless. Like perhaps gym equipment. No...they never troubles like that... true also America really isn’t anywhere cases low unfortunately. They’ve really Fckd  ""Only 13x"" huge boats, guns Follow money people. coming somewhere. asking ... think denial. you’re scared work, eat? get day day nothing happens, tell threat blown really protected and/or lucky. lack hygiene food production staggering. contribution dead food consumers unknown, ruled significant.

Chinese evidence points frequent food transmission, lab data implies must frequent, least refrigerated frozen food. many took pocketed $5 million ppe money, never repaid back. average American received $1.2k, last months. Watching ND closely. Watching Shamattawa, MB Canada closely.  Honestly everyone everywhere. Everybody every country trying shift blame make enact stay home orders. 

And happening ways. Municipalities waiting States. States waiting Federal top saying state's jurisdiction. happens politicians looking get elected governing.

They think nothing decision. inaction still decision. That’s point. Attacking opposing views causes polarization. can’t reconcile don’t address other’s concerns. can't outlaw speech Except wrong, second wave Sweden's spike larger neighbours.

For people country let die spring, despite Tegnell boasting May September, Sweden achieved practical level immunity. would say starts poor leadership. hmm? trying point hypothetical situation spring:

Risk groups 70+ yo vaccinated. Therefore we'll fewer deaths (70+ yo make 80% deaths) . lead carelessness among population rise cases. means hospitals overrun younger people they're less likely hospitalized, 13x difference hospitalizations 85+ group 18-29yo group. Case Fatality Rate still tracker. Better suited Daily Discussion post pinned front page. Dumb know people there? ground reality look there? Big country, may vary place place guess. ""Vielleicht bin ich immun, ich weiß es nicht."" Haha edge, much hot take. sound dumb speak. full expected anyone following reality streets. put something wooden shoes, let sit three days. Fr don’t like freedom that’s good thing think something like could useful. pandemic easy swipe carpet people's daily lives. seriously ill patients inside hospitals — sight, mind.

The stream suggested, even somewhat shocking many, would really eye-opening experience people.

Currently world inside hospitals — crucial part pandemic lot actual suffering happens — shown much. outer world shown.

It like talking ant nest ant hill ever shown never insides nest. Oh, agree 100% country adopted philosophy open attend risk could afford financial bailouts. like 4 5 months cases surprisingly low. However, attending gym least half wear masks.

India entirely true. protect legal consequences personal dumbassery, would protect actions employee co-owner.

Forming LLC get-out-of-jail-free card. can't form LLC, sell heroin, tell cops 'later suckers'. Every state clause effect ""you remain personally liable wrongdoing commit course LLC business."" Some?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* stupid? I'm asking many people dying young healthy? know vaccines stop people spreading covid yet?

If 80% people actually jab stop strain hospitals. 

And need really find long immunity lasts. time vaccine available majority population got vaccine first may need another jab.

And that's factoring possible long term effects vaccine tested (because can't situation).

I anti vax, sceptical going quick fix allows world return pre covid times within next months. flaws found vaccines throughout process considering first vaccine attempted type virus. suggest people survive without money support themselves? know economy works? destroy country What’s solution? originally going authorized today. really much different. Probably would authorized Friday even without statement really  I’m going get drunk rock concert talk strangers again. I’m also going go street festival. I’m going vacation “I miss time 3,000 Americans dying horrible deaths every day” TWiV! seems overall summaries policy oriented. TWiV (and sister podcast Immune) technically oriented getting science. basically paper discussions reach episode explanations layman. Plus, Daniel Griffins clinical updates every Friday excellent. 10 years prison time $233,483 damage.. wow Lack money could result loss life. food, getting kicked home apartment. etc... kinda valid support shutdown without financial support. people live paycheck paycheck that's have. people got newly infected Thanksgiving starting become hospitalized. thing happen two weeks Christmas/New Years. Buckle up, folks! lawsuit incoming, way they’re paying People, agree disagree lockdown pandemic government righfully thinks retarded, gave rights, didnt raise voice, didnt fight, surrendered freedom, went along plan, virus cause retarded look back sounds like conspiracy claiming doesnt exist, death numbers going up, fine cases going up, get infected (only 2 people sure that) afraid even immunity up. still think pandemic, still follow rules guidelines, still think weak vulnerable, beyond saving, kill yourself. Honestly im mean, worthless, kind person would report jews hiding attic, ""Wir haben das nicht gewussen"" problem, fear, lack reality, manifested wanted it, ever free it, kill yourself, better us. Smell vs sniff. dogs actually inhaling virus, detecting odors produced people virus.

I responding context article. know Covid affects dogs particular negative way infected. recall reshuffling 70’s Unless gym big fail. live within 10 minutes new case count 7,500 Thursday, obliterating previous records.

I also learned vaccine studies typically exclude extreme cases, even ""traditional"" timelines. guess makes sense, sucks children, pregnant women (even though think small sample one trials) allergic people gonna wait longer, even they'd rather take vaccine.

LA county 13k. 2 states. yea let’s slam FL. 🤦‍♀️🤫 FUCKING DUMB pretty good constitution Sweden, like good constitution basic written way requires law degree understand.

I quote official restriction may satisfy purpose “acceptable democratic society”. restriction may go beyond “necessary regard purpose occasioned it” may carried “so far constitute threat shaping opinion one fundaments democracy”.

This obviously allows restriction freedom movement context sufficiently serious threat. health authorities think pandemic sufficient threat, sure can't done. pretty clear think several levels threat. hard limit place constitution, saying freedoms *never* restricted. can.

Maybe FHI right proportionality justify restriction. absolutely right determining kind threat justifies kind restrictions, comes legal praxis academic considerations jurisprudence. claiming know details such.

But myth Swedish law completely blocks possibility lockdown. constitution demands justification restrictions - threat humanity imminent, need ignore constitution create new one. clearly legal framework place enact temporary restrictions.

Any politician health official saying constitution way lockdown trying dodge responsibility. say pandemic serious enough justify measures - take political academic (respectively) responsibility decision. obliged do, shame responsibility, even turn mistaken, duty anyway.

But think selling short constitution dismiss option entirely worse - denying people academics valid discussion, right. Whether academic political, decisions open criticism debate. Even authorities final say, open power exercising why. Sheriff Barnes asshole fear mongering. order require release community certainly require release of, specifically, violent offenders. trust CDC time?

Very true looking efficacy short term complications. see long term problems still need run longer studies. 

That said, already 3-4 months data available health care workers get it. someone living LA, feels little nuanced that. June opened fast, July kept things open closed things (indoor dining gone, outdoor dining could stay). numbers started going down. Even though numbers going down, kept everything restrictions July. Nothing changed numbers stayed low August, September, October, first part November. since things fine months, assumed restrictions place working. 

Then uptick cases noted. positivity rate hospitalizations began trending upward too. usually hovered little 1k cases every day months (which bad populous county country w/10mil ppl - many states). numbers around 3k 4k. People paying attention getting nervous, restrictions put place county state. hoping couple thousand daily surge going top precautions taken. started getting closer 10k. started getting 10k. Yesterday practically hit 14k. think fair say knew numbers going up, began putting restrictions place, knew immediate effect, even still anticipating cases rise much, rapidly. part surprising/shocking rn.

Problem people care still gathering other's houses. There's way enforce even law enforcement said enforce anyway. could big reason restrictions closures place matter much they're going impact people gathering indoors. fact mostly serve hurt many small business spent ton money upgrading COVID safety shut back again. ""They planned Smith's older brother officiate wedding front parents scaled-down ceremony field Lubbock, Texas, Bassett proposed. Bassett said favored location, believes abandoned golf course."" Well ignored basically two months. two months afterwards, still testing. SK tested many people one day America total. IMO, meeting like means pre-xmas quarantine blown. Long exposure like indoors lead source transmission. personally would choose meeting home, never both. participants unable understand reasoning, problem.


And ""soft quarantine??"" country adopted philosophy open attend risk could afford financial bailouts. like 4 5 months cases surprisingly low. However, attending gym least half wear masks. We'd still pandemic, living fear could die.

Are actually living like that? Wtf virus traveled every corner United States across planet .. yeah plastic shield I’m convinced ISN’T safe. It’s new. 

Unfortunately government doesn’t great history transparency, previous deception creates future doubt. 

Most important thing would long-term testing reporting side effects outcomes mass adoption. 

Ultimately isn’t going matter it’s going coerced everyone, anyway... won’t forced, can’t grocery shop, go school, bank, rent housing, visit medical provider unless vaccinated really “choice” ? Movies major part economy. Movies also major part entertainment industry. Sounds like going business either way. Either due revenue Covid huge fines state. Great sense humor there.  religious doesn’t make nut job. I’ve lived Bible Belt majority life. know plenty reasonable religious people. Hiding behind religion excuse act like irresponsible asshole qualifies religious nut job book. “They gave waterboarded knew telling truth” Poor souls  People ICU also last three days.

That's stupid (you judge downtrend least week) that's even true. number people ICU last 3 days 256; 257; 255.                 
On average, 10 people previous week.      
You consider plateau (I optimistic end year), certainly downtrend. would decrease lockdowned? ""Just like that, like miracle""? true. Plus hospitals turn much attention resources COVID patients rather people would normally get priority treatment. You’re going sooooo antiquated like ten years... live AZ truly Ohio US Spain Europe. one wears mask cares Corona. drive restaurants packed gills. NOTHING Doug Ducey needs RECALLED essentially commuting genoicde black brown, BIOPIC people POC. Yikes. one time...  hope subreddit posts comment threads preserved historical purposes. could provide really interesting insight historians archivists Sweden entered chat room. mean there's literally people hospitals dying covid still deny real Minnesotan proud guy.  wish people read book *Deadliest Enemy,* taken seriously. had. patients.. yes. sadly, many patients refuse believe real, despite literally dying ICU. article nurse exhausted fighting patients also trying save know deaths per capita. like Paris lot personally understand sentiment know one hold it. think deaths per capita likely change coming months though. live, hit 3000 daily cases first time November we're 7500, worrisome say least sincerely want get vaccine immediately. go toxic epidermal necrolysis reaction unknown medication young. don’t want go again. I’ll get it, live waiting bit, social distancing taking every last precaution I’ve taking far bit longer. study effects pregnant women, long term side effects? seems like lot still extremely experimental insane vaccines blanket legal immunity potential errors. great. Worried family going break isolation take dog vet. seems hurt paw somehow.  Part frustrating COVID individual risk indeed low--any one person unlikely die. said, group risk immensely high--people virtually guaranteed die.

So comes is, yes, optimism, also individualism, exceptionalism, plain old selfish behavior. know number people got COVID none got sick. also know someone whose husband died. death guaranteed outcome anyone recovering--both guaranteed outcomes. hard wrap head around low individual risk weighted high group risk, often leads invisible tragedies. 

It miracle us make thing without losing someone love, dying ourselves--even particularly likely one us dies. think makes better christians “wise” money paranoid. dad instance. makes 6 figures Alabama. never wants go anywhere spend money anything fun. thinks doesn’t enough saved make end life worried something bad happened like someone’s health civil war something crazy. rushed vaccine failure, Covid stay next 20 years. Merry Christmas 🙂 could tell individual COVID killed upwards 300,000 Americans since March, might inclined stay home. 


We definitely told possible, back March. could tell they're 20 healthy, probably die. perhaps also include relevant studies long term damage


How present studies long term damage virus that's barely 12 months old now? five ten months ago might spread love.

The number must huge. estimated unofficial cases also considerated talking 70% immunity would ideal? one lol! smell BS alright ... Winning again! I'm fan choice Biden Harris, though, see rationale choice. seems like forward-thinking hopeful choice, rather naming person group actually mattered right year.

Biden Harris interesting Trump. great relief. Yeah don’t disagree. disciplined financially system sucks. However, isn’t target audience. disciplined probably wouldn’t position need program begin with. system targeted behavior rather math. be. available people high-risk; ones clogging hospitals. 1% U.S. population die Covid. immediately enough doses vaccinate 1% population. obviously directly overlap young die. vaccinate 1% vulnerable, could see deaths hospitalizations drop huge amounts (25, 50% maybe? even know guess.) Michigan Department Corrections says staff identified 115 prisoners — 114 men one woman — diagnosed COVID-19 tested positive 90 days longer. 

That lot Reinfection means person infected once, recovered became infected again. CDC says possible, rare, get COVID-19 90 days initial “Confirmed cases reinfection still incredibly rare,” said Dr. Matthew Sims, director infectious diseases research Beaumont Health. “The number confirmed ones compared number actual cases COVID extremely low.”

Shall trust CDC time? Shall believe them, regulatory capture made information release completely untrustworthy?

Here 115 concentrated examples something CDC says rare. rare it? CDC needs clarify ignoring counter-examples prove completely wrong talking hats. UPS lose vaccine Oh no, can't spend money helping elderly instead bombing poor people third world countries *that's system designed!!!* Yes America, land free, getting caught tiny amount weed seen justification drown blood. prisoners fall high low priority vaccines? remember first time country imposed total lockdown, everyone feels fear virus brought. kept thinking vaccine made available. now, we're verge breakthrough heroes; frontliners scientists never gave looking solution. thanks y'all. mean use US USA talk country people called US-icans USA-ians. We're called Americans understandable people would also call country America. name country all. totally get America technically two geographical continents people feel however want whatever want. colloquially term America used refer USA Americans used refer people USA. Russia technically mostly Asian continent colloquially tend refer Russians Asians. Slightly different example concept. Like said, people feel however want since that's two way street, happen feel petty thing get upset about. Reality is, say America, people world assume mean USA, say Americans, people world assume mean people USA.  surge still would occurred likely regardless, smaller surge surge nonetheless. 

Personally, I'd rather soft summer/early fall give winter instead. Germany started lockdown October, cases would time bit relaxation Christmas. 'they' people.

Don’t care debate you. fun arguing might one stupidest posts time. People shit-tastically bad making informed decisions. Habits control us way we'd like admit. instilling fear people correct way either. Strong intelligent leadership needed face pandemic, obvious many ways failed us. Facts.

The American COVID-19 debacle primarily result *intentional efforts* politicians seeking additional power, corporations seeking additional billions.

~~ill still probably stay one anyway~~ Australia developed country without equivalent bill rights.

This quite correct counting UK's Bill Rights 1689 ""bill rights"" incorporated Australian law.

What US style bill rights explicitly listing rights. rights exist scattered various documents implied Constitution. great news! light end tunnel keeps getting closer.  \*9 month old \~In Together\~ sign frayed flapping wind\* study published Nature looking data 10 million people tested Wuhan months initial lockdown period ended found pretty small number re-infections 0 asymptomatic transmission among around 1700 contacts infected individuals (who asymptomatic, clear).

Good time 2020 act 3, near end year all. awesome! 2020 hell great way end year. 2021 full progress. Thanks amazing scientists got us point. hate people can't hang video calls.

You’re saying it’s impossible weaker virus previously would caused noticeable outbreaks sooner. That’s necessarily true. Wtffff fuckwads went. everyone contact with. 9/11 allowed openly tout xenophobia racism disguised patriotism Wow, so, messed up....

I remember fucking *terrified* virus aligning Lunar New Year, massive Chinese holiday. gov didnt shit.

How hard would tell everyone get *some* sort maks say masks dont thing tell us ride subway spread fomites.

How fucking hard set outdoor learning kids, prompt people gather OUTDOORS matter what.

How hard lockdown numbers start climb, like running ice, day stop activity cases continue rise.

How hard rally public create smart rules, promote restaurants destroy them.

I’ve patient safe since March continue continue get us mess tried tie-on cloth style (think surgeon's mask) instead ear-elastic style? Also, I've found bigger better, least me. favorite masks big enough wrap around chin.  incredibly sad- every individual death tragedy.

That said, really curious see mean cities states available funds. Fewer senior citizens likely translate less spending social security pensions. I'm especially curious NYC, since MTA's pensioners drain department faster even catch up. wonder lifting financial burden means states struggle maintain elderly way. (And please think I'm saying positive thing- lives worth state funding) Well think hiccup experienced fairly common alot vaccine trials never conclusive whether caused correlated vaccine. 

And secondly, don’t think they’re hiding anything think confusion laying effective vaccine different trials gave us different results. What's fucked even vaccine rolls everyone wants it, we'll probably see huge dent numbers. Seems like half country take cult reasons call people skeptical, thats offense us real rational skeptics. call paranoid obsessed. There's thin line sometimes.

The problem death count continues rise. infection count, know actual IFR pandemic actually ended. example, saw someone claim risk dying low, taken today's case rates compared death rates. case rates spiked, death rates hadn't, course looks good. 

An IFR 0.26% still crazy though. means 1/500 people catch it, die. People initially hesitant would able use rational thinking consider would best interests, whereas antivaxxers would not.

That means self-imposed lockdown last year realistically end around May... (I'm playing safe.) Well, I'm halfway - gotta find hobbies! produce anything published september? Maybe something specifically talking vaccine safe science unsound? Costco tonight too. Must gotten big shipment. could prevented, too, infuriating.

According Worldometers, LA county 8,200 deaths population 10 million. 820 deaths per capita, would right national median (the median less mean, mean skewed states top). However, California whole 528 deaths per million, currently bottom quarter. discrepancy due northern California much lower deaths per capita. counties Bay Area 300 deaths per million less, similar Oregon whole, one handful states 300. Oh God! saying vaccines 100% certain, small minority people may great reaction it!?

In experience first-generation immigrants (both teacher life general) ""make best Americans"" take nothing American experience granted embrace best America try live it. ""Do anything contribute discussion? ""

I do. Stop talking shit. would say comfort loved one important possible risk. Especially someone needs medical help cannot get themselves.

What found benefitted drinking plenty water, apparently baby aspirin recommended. found deep breathing exercises like I'm exercising (controlled breathing instead panting) helped breathlessness. also found every taking cough syrup ease *chest congestion helped recover bit.

None medical advice. studies showing link lockdown stringency COVID mortality, 18 highlighting immense costs lockdown.

So, know lockdowns save anyone, kill lots people. Pretty tough cost-benefit sell Prolly wont. Probably closer 450k lot fudging numbers numbers counted. That's dumb prediction. lucky enough covid case mild. However sense smell hasn’t returned it’s killing me. idea dull life become can’t smell things. Smell linked strong memory hate taken away. 

Stay safe people see good news. less expected government fudged up, course did, going 40k trials 3 million getting vaccinated within week insane. Look progress. Doctors notorious scared doctors they're ill. goes dentists. suprised many dentists scared going dentist patient :) Many MD lean hard appeal authority. Unfortunately many buy it.

Also difficult would test traits ER? information turned rapidly administered therapudics? completely support asshole mitigation. generally correct notion. get ready downvotes apparently Trump runs FDA, CDC, US Treasury, mention also runs UPS FedEx. 

The point US federal government, GENERALLY speaking, sucks actually getting things done. Doesn’t matter asshole sitting Oval Office is. cousins mums best mate said dads boss died covid sh*t, sayin serious get go! !! ,🙊👈 thing they're actually bad things imagine side doing. rock living aware this? Currently trial, tested twice. world full fake news, sometimes apply commonsense logic. really believe Trump GOP spend $50 billion making prosthetic penis?

Wipes harder find right PS5! thought supposed trust scientists. ones agree you? 4,000 people get disease save million lives, end pandemic, it.

Also worth noting disease rarely cause permanent problems. cured gone within weeks.  would stay rate though? Barely. 10 vs 11 million. definitely cut dry like people saying. say people poor savings *have* go work, even taking virus seriously, options *most* financially better citizens stay home really shelter it. according CDC. appreciate incredible come new vaccine new virus still actively learning about?

The idea giving tax breaks rich, buy products stimulate economy, driven economic policy since Reagan. work. rich hoard wealth use get richer. actually spent money, neoliberal idea might merit.

Yet, attitude care concerned yourself. 

This attitude exactly rich, mega rich, managed shape economic policy create conditions trap many people debt first place. 

But, said, see care obviously concerned that. think take long. get certain percentage think we'd immunity. I'm doctor scientist though, could off. heard. Teachers risk they’re older students I’d even argue less. better worse someone that’s 25 basically 90x lower probability dying vs someone 65+. 

We need heavily vaccinate elderly. that’s done, honestly act like flu rest us especially 40 relative good health. dose, please?  Pass stimulus otherwise blame businesses trying stay open.

Go ahead censor comment! refuse drink water fountain!  Funny thing deaths reported covid huge amount. suspect real covid numbers almost twice reported. run 10,000 tests / day &amp; ~40% positive rate. Sure, keep cases low capping them. I’ll surprised history demonstrates lot excess deaths WI.

-your friendly Canadian neighbour Wild since literally saw yesterday dozen  phone? Incarceration rates. USA #1 beating El Salvador Turkmenistan. *And make us?* mere fact kept borders closed - every country indefinitely - therefore could easily track every single case entering 

The easiest counter. No. track every case entering. Australia community spread unknown contacts. least 15.7% known cases [locally acquired infection identified Closing borders stop community internal geography helps well: populated areas distant 

I think know Australia's geography population distribution. 6 states 2 territories. Even look capital cities, [5 states territories 250km 650km next capital. 6 states territories within 750km next. Travel next state capital happens time. cases day trip. 

The country might huge land area much population concentrated one small region it. drive less 12 hours except one populated cities around them. 

We also [notable virus border hopping two populous cities. 

The city cannot drive Hobart. another island. immune resistant community spread either. Tasmania's small population exactly makes vulnerable. reliant rest country borders always stay open people, often needing medical treatment need flown Melbourne for, skilled workers deliveries. time risking cluster cluster risking community spread. measures reduce risks matter, easily track spread virus borders inward September October 

So? reverse true Australia. see spread outwards coastal port hop borders states. Spreading borders community spread. entry country. entry points different effect community spread. effects virus enters. 

I understand exactly beneficial living island also limitations live one. bad, like making comparisons went wrong.  every body luxury going living lives. Maybe you’re young live us live people high risk. Ie: dad needs open heart surgery next month can’t afford get sick point really need care recovers can’t go “live life” level community infection spread. Vaccine coming soon, yes, effects won’t seen months millions received doses it.  Trump manage force UK Canada approve vaccine well? someone work telling multiple people received Pfizer vaccine already died...fake news spreads way fast shocking gullible average person is. sure legit news sources. probably partially badly handled U.S. 1 person dead tragedy, 1 million statistic.

It controllable now. stop vaccine widely distributed.

There going even scarier numbers January. still undeniable long term data this. impossible say vaccine behave someone 5 years shot right now, ranges still immune, back normal, perhaps even increased reaction upon virus reexposure.

Vaccines also take long time run trials 5 years cohorts ensure works planned.

I believe science know it, know everyone chain professionals, undeniable fact never known less long term implications vaccine distributed wide scale.

YouTube best facts are. learned rebuild carburetor pizza parlor basements. virus causes less harm 16-18 year olds think risks might worth getting vaccinated over. vaccine dangerous people 18 concerns. Unfortunately I’ve started noticing trend nursing circles don’t believe vaccines, reject opinions doctors outright believe limited anecdotal evidence unscientific observations facts presented medical science community. act like Facebook moms instead healthcare professionals. can’t even trust nurses anymore don’t know ones subscribe Facebook university push MLM trash etc. vs ones actually get information real doctors medical science.

It’s logical there’s possibility go inject people probably side effects. 1 million vaccines available 1millon people get vaccine percentages alter. it’s stays low sure I’ll take would like wait . People always say ""they would never sue me""

I never hear people say ""My buddies insurance company would never subrogate me"" I'll lucky get one June. stoked finally happening. Right? pessimism bias way think good outcomes happen me. people exposing themselves. getting curbside pickup. mall makes sense seeing people still crowding bars restaurants around here. Least malls everyone masked up. Honestly it’s unreal close already former CVS pharmacist, told interfere non compliant, non-mask wearing patients came in. signs posted everywhere reminding customers wear mask weren’t allowed say anything them, even felt unsafe. Dan Griffin national treasure It’s strange me, personally.

its strange...there many fda approved medications passed safety studies approved use later pulled market causing serious side effects...we currently midst another great pandemic caused widely used medications went thru safety studies approved fda - opioid crisis oxycontin. standard set safety studies fda approval mean certainly going safe.

personally, im trying reading day RNA, mRNA basics vaccine might work side effects theoretically could possible vaccine RNA related treatments general kind health problems might occur anything relating RNA...so far found anything im concerned about, found many, many things im confused about. 

im guessing im low priority getting vaccine - im young, work outdoors mostly alone, live somewhere rural low case numbers, time able get it, millions people also gotten much worry immediate side effects point, someone worried long term side effects, going take decades 100% sure long term side effects, obviously im going wait long take vaccine might well take soon easily available without make appointments weeks advance, stand lines jump thru kinds hoops...once call doctor pharmacy make day appointment easily get vaccine, figure point anyone wants get wont getting way anyone might need getting vaccine early rollout less easily available, point lots people taken it. Yeah 99.97% survival rate /s


What say someone says this? I’m sure make sure send thoughts prayers Oh sweet summer child. Facebook perhaps? different article posted stated manufacturing issue - Pfizer get components needed make vaccine large quantity, procured meet standards. caused delay amount vaccine available first waves rollouts. I’m sure that’s long-term side affect studies work Ridiculous comparison.

We went war 9/11 Iraq oil nukes.

A lot get first dose vaccine think throw away mask start making strangers day, never mind takes time immunity build up. might even 'forget' take second dose. Quite understanding  got bad one city start winter city locked HARD rest winter spring good people live managed completely eliminate virus city. 10k people die everyday USA normal times

Of contagious disease?

Shut then. ignore it. prefer calmly explain wrong, hope help lead mire misinformation. try understand claim is, evidence is, any. 

Anyway, sometimes asking questions helps correct mistakes. Science collecting facts information, explaining why.

If cannot explain something, theory wrong. 

So, I'll ask question again.

Why many people dying?

If true infections identified false positives, fake infections turn hospital admissions, full ICUs deaths. mysterious lack ill people dead.

However that's case.

Deaths increases 140% countries.

***Why many corpses?*** Probably people adamant home Besides fact good, still 90-95% effective. many people get vaccine could still get sick.

It's another reason masks required even vaccines start flowing. Requiring two months safety data absolutely bare minimum, especially since entirely new type vaccine technology. top that, one reasons Covid deadly, causing long haul cases, over-reactice immune system triggering essentially autoimmune diseases patients (they're finding IL6 increases, ANA, antiphospholipid antibodies patients Covid). Although Pfizer use virus vector, requiring two months, typical amount time takes actual case Covid go exposure death long haul, makes absolute sense.

When comes new vaccines, want skimp safety data. Two months barely drop bucket time required usually emergency authorization. want repeat 1976 Swine Flu vaccine, ended causing 450+ cases GBS made many sick. also highly politicized election year rushed thought strain flu would deadlier was. vaccine ended completely pulled, enough safety data approving (and also lead stricter regulations vaccine approval). I’m 18, mean get vaccine? age matter

Younger people generally stronger immune response, might mean require lower dose vaccine get protection can't tell trials completed.

The main problem vaccine tested youth date, work. hail 2019 corona virus! breaker chains! mother legions away Nevada she’s near prioritized@risk insists living house she’s technically exposed whenever brother wife visits due jobs. It’s like they’re forcing @risk scurry find  nursing home in. I’m quite educated science works thank you. keep arguing points tangential said.

I said:

* Many scientists religious. comment OP downvoted, commented factually accurate.

* Science religion ask different questions thus incompatible.

You stated:

* Religion science function completely differently

* Religion clearly flawed 

* thrown shit around like frustrated toddler, ad hominem attacks. 

The first two completely irrelevant questions asked, third embarrassing.

You test hypothesis previously stated. don’t answer new one pretend answers original. Reminder nurses technicians, scientists. ask carpenter botany. Even effeciencies Germans inadequate stop pandemic spreading within borders. mean. really tried tell u Age matters enough research verify whether vaccine safe age group. AFAIK four voted one undecided, based decision lack research. However, others voted argued enough verify safety age group, younger people generally better immune systems lower risk. Additionally, I'm saying matter, I'm saying people voted thought trials done verify safety age group. However, younger people less risk, anyways, trials age group would slow release vaccine. thousands people dying every day. I’m commenting historical reasons. panels asked experts ""Do benefits vaccine outweigh risks?"" 16/17 year olds experts felt enough information answer sure. mean yes absolute black white. 16/17 year olds risks associated Covid lower, risks vaccine lesser known (for lack current study).

So offered would good idea talk medical professionals decide benefits outweigh risks you. OK wait studies done (and they're starting already younger age groups). Seems pretty subjective. millionaire I'd probably hang Mediterranean. Agreed. think 6-8 months 2021 normal. Like said let know goes . would like wait . Regardless would like random shots pain vaccine . suggests drug act different stages disease. studies must conducted first** demonstrate effect ivermectin Covid-19, determine effect due antiviral action finally study administration convenient also hospitalized patients due apparent anti-inflammatory effect. enough people willing/actually get it...

I agree though, shitty letting hundreds skip queue economic reasons, govt better. person replied said 2 million would die instead 1 million Covid. said doubled number deaths.

Also, Covid doesn’t add deaths also takes away sources. Covid deaths people would died flu, died Covid instead, Covid deaths people wouldn’t died. It’s still usual 300000 new people dying year US mom dad born Portuguese consulate given citizenship. clunky can't see better way write it.

According Washington Post ""Meanwhile, [an advisory Centers Disease Control Prevention, recommended health-care workers nursing home residents first recipients, expected bless vaccine Saturday, paving way inoculations begin early next week."" 

So looks like Sunday now, great! problem.

Not case, DeSantis said thought U.S. Department Health Human Services, signed agreement Pfizer Inc., would allocate vaccines based states’ so-called at-risk populations. Instead, DeSantis said federal government “basically population basis.”    Yeah looking this. Pfizer rolling 2.9 million doses get see..even data works. 

Which hope enough convince ppl it’s safe. believe vaccine takes week two work feel ppl claiming doesn’t work cause got Covid days 1st shot. Makes sense they’re American.  incomplete trial data. finding stuff today? Pfizer vaccine clearly preferred candidate one far approval production.

Once ones get approval available widely while.

Which one better you? one available one unavailable testing fully completed yet? Utah native 100-year-old ""Candy Bomber"" Gail Halvorsen tested positive COVID-19, family members confirmed Friday. former U.S. pilot known dropping hundreds candy boxes West Berlin Soviets' blockade World War former pilot regained fame recent months several Utah lawmakers recommended Halvorsen awarded U.S. Presidential Medal Freedom — highest honor civilian receive.

Side effects start page 39. includes Bell’s palsy 40 days participants none given placebo Thank prayers thinking us! 10 days, they’ll done quarantine able meet granddaughter first time. They’re excited. hoping keep vaccine available US. Yeah healthcare pretty awesome tbh. hope distribute countries first. I'm Melbourne covid case 43days straight doses would definitely much better used elsewhere Well heard Fauci said. I'll take Fauci's word. even said FDA even 'dicking' around? Trump? said FDA effort today without 'motivation? Trump? think man called virus pandemic hoax concerned citizenry? theatrics. I'm sure FDA knows scale urgency much better.

But really FDA. pretend Trump something. Trump anything better nations already vaccinating. get Boris Johnson threat tweeting UK agencies get vaccine out. 

Who calls twitting work? That's rather ironic. like Pestilence Medicine (not Conquest Freedom) .

It's basically [risk compensation [a theory people typically adjust their behavior in response perceived level risk, becoming careful sense greater risk less careful feel Yeah I’m think summer pretty normal.

To add know seasonality pronounced immunity high population. It’s entirely possible could enough immunity virus diminished sporadic outbreaks US next summer even disappears almost entirely like flu every year.

In theory could see one final fall surge, don’t think significant happens all. summer vaccines hopefully available everyone including children don’t think cases declining discourage many people getting vaccinated. parents get kids vaccinated polio measles despite viruses normally circulating communities. Yeah, there’s way deaths “drop like rock” two months. Drastically different, young demographic used prop social security No, it’s statistically significant. fact, it’s normal background population rate. Unfortunately people don’t donate much. It’s OK want pandemic end selfish reasons, also global health reasons. sounds like things responsibly fellow man right now. long that’s happening, don’t feel guilty wanting life back, wedding. It’ll make much sweeter get it. beaches Normandy every day months.

Those countries deal population density inaccess/poverty can’t compare to

The fact similar peer nations despite insane relative wealth infrastructure damning anything else I'm suggesting everyone eats restaurant going die. think fair say indoor dining result additional deaths. think could look one deaths eye tell need die keep job. know supposed happen. hope happens. 4 objections approving teens 16-17 much data age range. believe said changed recommendation 18+ (instead 16+), they'd board dont understand foregone conclusion. anything 2000 page document thats going stop approval. countries approved 3000 people dying day. dont know would buried document FDA say ""nope good enough us"".  gives corporations money gets socialism 13k antigen tests backlog cleared days ago. Current reports backlog anymore Also thanks animals forcibly sacrificed create vaccine virus created animals kept filthy conditions. 

While great news anti-vax, hope one day find way move toward world eliminates animal experimention eliminates need enslave use sentient beings period. would like see Literally today found one coworkers came relatively mild symptoms (likely he’s attending competing *indoor* speed skating meets), another said mild symptoms probably sign virus weakening we’d fine soon. Meanwhile I’ve got loved ones work hospitals, work COVID patients, it’s patently untrue. Even virus weakening, hospitals full medical staff beyond overworked. need medical care right now, there’s lot space, lot doctors nurses help right now. 

Plus coworker sick week, hasn’t gotten taste sense smell back yet, idea long-term side-effects could 6 months line. feel like I’m taking crazy pills say don’t want roll dice odds, seem fine it. thousands people dying per day. approval took weeks data available.

I'm saying take shortcuts. I'm saying procedure quickly possible. There's reasonable explanation I've heard would exain we've wait long approval. I’m saying shouldn’t lookout range expected values it’s small it’s highly probable zero within range. 

Now let’s say getting zero statistically significant. could still result random chance it’s unlikely. Okay draw result placebo could make less likely get relatively minor ailment. say know certain experimental group fell line expected results. 

Now theorize placebo resulted lower incidence 

1) placebo something that’s preventative ailment. great. 

2) placebo effect lowers incidence vaccine elevated incidence back expected numbers. isn’t essentially bad would mean getting vaccine didn’t change health. However would decent concern whether mechanism vaccine went increase incidence back normal levels problematic besides this. 

So let’s say 0 significantly different 4 statistically (it probably isn’t would probably mentioned experimenters part standard procedure, I’m personally find p value myself). case doesn’t really even make vaccine look bad imo, would curious. I'm 44, that's cool. IIRC, Indonesia’s 97% claim sinovac specifically many people raised antibody response in. Still testing efficacy preventing COVID 50% compared next closest 7%... great! They’ll probably healthcare workers group living first, won’t far behind. keep listening? chumps arguing ""per capita"" statistics really disappointed half million people actually half million people. 3 million die year. rate suggested article commenting on, 1 million may die Covid related illness. Although, it’s fair say rate article would continue 12 months.  

You need read comments better. comment stretching meaning original. Yeah, last spring saying would summer 2021 earliest, even reach. Amazing could develope short amount time, even still technically finished trials. assuming weren’t aware COVID vaccine different mechanism action something like attenuated vaccine do, way, contract virus. 

They also really one word away saying said. said “you still *can* get COVID...” wouldn’t wrong. agree crucial word terms accuracy statement. Still, wanted bridge gap said true. believe trick look judge actions perspective others - selfishness key factor IMO. Selfish people justify decision personal freedoms, etc. Selfless talk part avoid spread, etc. get vaccine record time get VACCINE INJECTED ASS RIGHT That's hard say. 4-14 days Christmas start see curve gatherings, course there's new years.

It's impossible say, people sporadically following rules. forget jam packed 7/11: mini marts. Dat slurpie! Yeah, we're low risk. go anywhere. Although go supermarket. go gym, indoor anything stuff like that. wife pregnant we're trying play safe right now. Canada's bit shit-hole. problem keep comparing USA, one worst countries hit, instead countries dealing Covid properly. Canada also rough start, lot people thinking strange reason masks help. Plus, course, influence nearby Americans, even Canada's got anti-maskers. really long ago health care workers Canada working nursing homes without masks, despite pandemic started. Now, they're paying price though. lot Canadians complacent though, thinking they're OK they're better USA. Let’s vaccinate everybody wants first see turns out. that's probably even true since starting elderly, one would expect x.xx% people die every day age group.

and people can't math logic blame vaccine rather accounting normal first finding difference. working car buddy’s garage. tools, radio program. would rude complain, hours went OK. cares? covid stuff killing people already dying &amp; people acting like scary. Wow. link says this? Needs made meme. Additional 100 million doses. 

[Moderna read kind ""well least 200 mink died"" know feel horrible. Maybe don’t understand methodology. seems like point trial involves testing patients infection could test times therefore glean bit data level spread risk.



The reason I’m arguing take step back look economics see would test subjects “necessary”; it’s partly (barely) it’s inconvenient patient. It’s there’s added benefit Pfizer collect data. They’re trying first market, first market vaccine **also** limits spread. aiming latter, broader marketing claim they’d endanger chances reaching former. superposition waves simultaneously state fucked turbo-fucked 30% more. may Testing access top notch here. get aches pains arm time get shot, stress out, shot. Risking complications COVID well known severe pretty large group people rather possible unlikely complication inherently lower risk type vaccine calculus make. would time.

It's going bit late come conclusion March. I'd estimate it'll get worse late 2022-23, long everyone vaccinates and, follows rules, wears masks, etc. No, 3028 Extra 100M better run government, position. 

The buck stops somebody though........... Yes is, give up. people generally need solve issues own.

*rural communities whoop cheer collecting welfare food stamps* Right?

I wish could go back 2019 viruses didn’t exist nobody died. Yeah, deaths. takes weeks weeks put us squarely 2021. vice versa post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* dumbfucks still dont wear fucking mask. deserve it.

For get mad people telling wear mask 10 months ago, also deserve Go gas station. Little mini mart packed people big noses hanging masks. sure packed mini mart better outdoor restaurant... They're really going coconuts year. 🥁 watched Utopia yesterday hated idea targeted viruses. wishing SS solvency medicare via virus. power vote address issues. pandemic upend livelihoods. government. Jesus Christ people like exist. literal definition waste oxygen. really depends Oxford, J&amp;J go, accepted late January, could possibly see wide scale availability April. thing slowed everyone behaves well, been, hence death toll, unfortunately.

The vaccine rollout slow, take years (decades) build enough immunity slow spread herd immunity takes over. often wonder related generational abuse, people beginning wake said abuse mental health becomes important new generation.

I never close paternal grandparents never really got know them. Saw blue moon growing up. know ever really fully realized paternal grandfather passed, work hard call single memory him. paternal grandmother passed days ago Covid (though Alzheimer's would pretty much done anyway; apparently even speak anymore), sad situation ambivalent. similar case maternal grandparents- I've much closer growing up, still never really seen year decade since maternal grandfather passed (again, barely remember him). father mentioned years neglected growing possibly verbally and/or emotionally abused. probably played part sister never saw parents much. mother (and least one sisters), hand, covert narcissist; meaning least one parents is/was narc well.

People exactly like spending time people like. parents elderly cannot care themselves, absolutely act caretaker. want spend time feel obligated to. decent, loving, compassionate people, maybe would try care time; alas, seems case often back time go, narc/enabler couple. kids, would probably never let see parents all.  Again, “mask wearing social distancing” “restrictions general”. Certain industries, like one used job in, compatible neither.

Like, trying do? Convince problems listed bad? Dude, reopening restaurants social distancing zero things climate change, get high horse. ain't vaccine circulation. Sorry mention talking people literally got days ago UK...like people dropping dead day getting vaccine. He's talking GDP (PPP), Nominal. Tr-ump like say ""China manipulates yuan"", means economic output masked exchange rate. average Chinese pay much much less Americans get thing, especially considering things manufactured China. many indicators like movie market, luxury goods market etc., already #1. Yes long term effects? That's moot point. Excess deaths already 400k. God, terrific news. cant even believe long year been, like completely normal march 13th, went last day high school day, even knowing would last day. got home school friday, announced two week school closure, everyone excited 2 week break, are. Coming someone native Arizona, uncool rest y'all ship old folks us. 
We geezer storage. They’re triaging everyone within they’re via lottery. Part limited supplies first. Right, there's suspicion there, whether suspicion justified another whole thing. Let's hope, posted Facebook. credible source support people vaccinated still spread Covid? I've already begun arguing people facebook spread disinformation shit. clearly states approved quickly would without sufficient data ensure safety efficacy. excuse would forgoing regulatory responsibility meeting higher expectations? literally said this

*What hell? No.*

*It’s “3 6 months” “easy” mask wearing social distancing.* saw happens. study did.

And yet there's still cases like people UK allergic reactions previously unseen. cautious vaccine developed, tested distributed ~9 months kook shit like people making be. true heroes eyes. would likely failed service exhaustion. one social distancing, may hear people want to, people be. Exactly. clear enemy first one, something take anger on. much this. (And please think I'm saying positive thing- lives worth state funding)

You realize sound super cold here, right?

Have calculated cost everyone rational you? 

Should line death drug calculations said would better died planet? Depends count la ""metro"" count Orange parts San Bernardino county even Ventura pushing 14 mil. sucks quitting option That’s someone Making America Great dying! Maybe deaths hit 5,000/day people pay attention stop calling fake, doubt it. Serious effects vaccines general extremely new RNA vaccine, likely less, rather prone side effects.

No, can't know happens 10 years without 10 year studies, fast approaching millions dying right now, COVID far, far likely long term effects subset people it. risk complications form vaccine appear much lower successfully overcoming disease anyway. Further, like get long terms studies vaccine approved. takes 10 years takes long even get phase 2/3 clinical trials. wait 5-10 years them.

It's messy world, emergency authorization perfect, point backed quite bit science people appear recognize. makes far less sense take chances COVID rather pretty well although perfectly studied vaccine. death rate 18-34 underlying conditions NY conservatively .007%

That’s extremely rare. Hot take: people care 9/11 deaths covid deaths actually care 9/11 deaths - hate arabs. Time start preparing people this. second injection probably make feel poorly couple days. Scary, vaccine make asymptomatic carrier. personally didn’t experience coughing eating. actually started feeling better, Thanksgiving dinner went bed feeling better. woke around 4am bad cough, tightness chest difficulty getting deep breath. Went hospital pneumonia. Thankfully recovered three days treatment. physician initiated treatment said good went hospital symptoms. I'm saying people likely accept. crazy think year level Lockdowns obeyed. Ugh! even know vaccine prevents infection transmission! nurses could spreading everyone else! Biden's reaction meme worthy Get summer body ready! friends. killers. Omg that's terrible. Party invites/social media stories really piss off. Halloween - New Year's Eve bad, people America fucking stupid.  Better getting COVID! Fuck no. last 7 days, it’s averaged 2200. last week killed heart disease average. source that? Come down! honest. would, cares? symptoms fatigue sleepiness! even respiratory symptoms. also survived 1918 influenza pandemic, cancer, multiple natural disasters according article.

What legend! Perhaps immortal even Queen England mom's hospital nurses/techs/doctors work directly covid patients first, 65 and/or preexisting conditions. given first round, though. mom severe allergies told hospital give Pfizer vaccine directly affect her, really, wants coworkers access. Yes! work retail STILL argue customers pretty much daily put mask enter store. 
 
I call police ~~customer~~ trespasser last week wear mask refused leave store. people going even reckless careless announced vaccines here...so going like ""meh...w/e...vaccine comin dough...""

i hate people also don’t know long term effects COVID. know people shorter sickly lives. certainly take chances vaccine. theres anything covid taught me, many people short term memory certain events. Perhaps repressing memory contributed towards spread events silent generation slips silently away. generation narcissism. Uhhh. hospital already surveyed staff department interest. team triaging planning distribution weeks. received order groups receive email today well dates expect it. *so original* Right - chances get I’ll either symptoms mild, seems random severe symptoms. Plus don’t want give anyone else. husband works factory around 100+ people every day, I’m always little freaked out. Feel like it’s matter time... So, kind odd question guess: US population going deaths? population still increasing rapidly pandemic? They’re going run antibody tests eventually. Hope it’s you, person reading comment, please cautious social distance got wrong. forgot important qualifier. USA number 1 anything desireable. Covid deaths? #1 school shootings #1, ect course not. things generally don’t deter living life normally. 

If wasn’t brutal older people doubt would lockdowns preventative measures. Yeah. sad way life. I've use D-Day example. long normally take 156,000 troops? long take invading Hitler's Europe? Housing expensive common big households either multigenerational families lots roommates working different jobs. Lots potential cross contamination compared places owning place achievable. Civets believed spread SARS humans, isn’t surprising. weren’t even expecting Sunday, right? see anti-maskers consciously trying hurt others. Yeah that's problem lol bad headline would confuse hell demographic it’s directed Tbf us Manitoba bad us per capita sick people. Holy crap. idea many people hated anyone health issues. apathetic, ""yes would go Walmart symptomatic without mask even knew cashier Type 1 diabetes"".... like ton folks ok killing minor convenience.

I guess surprise. mean, look US health care. Look prices stay alive diabetic ask ""do people hate diabetics?"" answer's pretty clear ""yes"". Yep, trying laser focus actual problems. Outdoor dining big deal. 

Sadly mega churches still open won’t shut assholes Sunday sideshow bullshit. dumb me? first pass sounds lot like marketing wank. “Can’t talk right now, hot girl shit” 💁🏻‍♀️ Saturday, Nov. 7, food started tasting strange her, said, experience smell taste loss, symptom coronavirus.

What?! That's like saying dark brown hair brunette.

As someone plays ""Is allergies covid?"" game regular basis understand dismissing symptoms give break. might gotten admitted hospital sooner fact thought shingles, went doctor — shingles — doctor even consider covid bit mind-boggling.

Apparently, shingles *can* also cause loss taste smell seem symptoms manifest conjunctions face head. Even knowing that, l understand covid first conclusion jump food starts tasting weird. think missed point intentionally obtuse. 

Sure leaving hurt anyone. Ignoring science same.  They'll make sure dying peoples families can't sue deceased employer exposing covid. No. still carry transfer it, might work them, million reasons. nurses know this. can't even imagine pain. grandma raised getting old. contact financial aid department hospital ask help paying bill!

you fill bunch forms job unemployment greatly reduce whatever left pay ask payment plan. sound like complete nutjob. Stop reproducing Nice know. 150 millions get vaccinated June (possibly more), considering 10s millions infected recovered then, cases could already negligible. I'm arguing general gist, attacking science. I'm pointing flaw understanding science. tautology way scientists search truth: assume natural order described mathematically test predictive, repeatable theory arrived at. worked well far improving human lot gone. 

And maybe make assumptions four sentences? degree biology sequencing evolutionary diversity lab couple years. Evolution fact. there's enough bad arguments misunderstandings going around appreciate coming direction. plenty well grounded criticisms lob way religious organizations handled covid19 starting legal system hold churches accountable causing promote spreading events, mention preaching politics pulpit. true?

I would like know someone familiar covid PCR test comment this. infrastructure already place coronaviruses studied time. Average stay nursing home supposedly 835 days according google.

There many studies this. Here's issues *average* stays mean stays sometimes much higher median stays small number nursing home residents live really long time. naturally brings *average* reflect reality situation. 

It's detailed linked paper. recommend reading entirety. revelatory me. *has* taken responsibility, fault!

edit: that's now-famous quote certain debate aired couple months ago, attributed certain someone. medical costs incurred near end life think big part young people worked death crap wages. hard go hear lazy family gathering, cause late working 3 crap jobs. makes sense.

Let's hope wrong, prevent eh? immune system shitty, going rough go COVID. That's came for. Thanks limiting factors 

Production, distribution, cost, public hesitance get vaccinated, children .

I don’t think it’ll anytime soon definitely get better every month going forward Earths way down. company insurance tho..... might wonder penalty giving vaccine target population? know nursing home hospital doctors going find way get doses family friends too. quite I’ve seen. CDC website. don’t actually get Covid mRNA vaccine(or types). “sick” may feel vaccine cells changing fight Covid. 

“mRNA vaccines contain material virus causes COVID-19 gives cells instructions make harmless protein unique virus. cells make copies protein, destroy genetic material vaccine. bodies recognize protein build T-lymphocytes B-lymphocytes remember fight virus causes COVID-19 infected get it, hate wearing masks, uncomfortable me. hate able hug friends, I’m hugger. wear mask, keep distance. privilege able follow rules, do, much can, exhausted.

Weird, heard exclusively conservative friends. That's answer? What's wrong guy? Oh brother... really. Mostly deaths riding US, Canada, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia Eastern Europe. places caused huge death spikes last two months mostly declining (western Europe, Tunisia, Jordan, Israel, Iran, Morocco, Tunisia, Argentina, Eastern Europe like Czech, Poland, etc) seem lack basic understanding science. Whether bunch scientists religious beliefs completely irrelevant whether science religion compatible not. Scientific principles exist independent personal beliefs scientists. Even great scientists frequently wrong even comes science. Newton spend much late years alchemy believing real science. Einstein dismissed quantum mechanics contradicted religious belief. verifiably wrong. That's main difference science religion. There's authority science. believe everything scientist says, look data arguments presenting, apply time tested scientific principles critical thinking, reproduce experiments see whether correct yourself.

Currently 33%ish via worldometers last week average. extrapolating. Jam one peehole good pleasure

FTFY 1.) don’t trust immune system capable handling vaccine. 
2.) don’t trust healthcare provider provide care bad reaction. 
3.) don’t trust infrastructure/logics keep vaccine cold enough. 


If desperate think chance have, see jumping right away. I’m early adopter. institutions failing. exact thing I’ve hearing liberal friends. think early “they want see legit studies” “see happens first.” I’m going bit nuts days..  people brainwashed, stupid, selfish, ignorant. Tens thousands people vaccine trials, 0 deaths... retired doctor take chances dying virus probably 5-10% chance killing catches it? Yikes. really stop using 9/11 comparison. side calls scare tactic.

just say losing small towns worth people day something. dont compare terorrists crashing planes buildings. doesnt help. saw happens. study did.

And regular people, get see hundreds millions people 3-6 months do. Probably going lot more. I’m guessing we’ll see least 4,000 deaths day soon. Crazy haven’t gone actual lockdown it’s leading cause death US That’s shitty thing internet: anyone say anything make seem believable. Sadly, people check sources share shit Facebook. gets big sources shot down, damage done. Examples: plandemic, two guy drs ca, group fake docs steps official building. We're seeing people showing extent knowledge vaccines comes Legend. result governments lying hiding shit people. people stops believing anything said government says. Same. remember March people saying “oh, two weeks we’ll alright,”

My school really told us ""we re-assess situation 2-3 weeks inform safe resume back campus"" dumbass audacity slightest sliver hope would possible. Well I'm law school med school reason lol Wow, sub allow highwire links? God forbid blue haired redditors subjected real scientific discussion. Loss taste something tasting thing. That's like saying someone color blind cannot see all. fantastic explanation something personally realize. comforting. 

The vote 17 experts for, 4 1 abstained. would think deserve hear 5 experts voted way determine extra cautious reasons. want everyone take vaccine think deserve info too. also little sketched Trumps guy threatening CDC approve Pfizer one tonight quit. kind stuff serve build public trust. cupboards stocked full toilet paper... *just case.* Every day like waking nightmare, that’s probably best way describe it’s like working healthcare right now. wondering CA would surge, it’s taken it’s here. Right we’ve doubled one single cause. 2 million now. Add AdBlock Plus extension browser. Improves quality life approx. 150% Superiority complex. people went mall. Bullshit. happens GOP refuses job they've sworn representatives American People left us dry favor big corporations Corporate Covid Immunity. Greedy, corrupt sociopaths.   Still mask mandates though right? Tegnell advised wearing masks, even crowded indoor places. always. Sometimes people endanger times don’t. 

Like things world, optimism bias neither good bad. depends circumstances. Healthcare leaders got shots yesterday nurse hid needle behind hand. tell you? Hint: needle likely go in. Ah, like ""blame Bush"" mentality lot Obama voters had. think going stop tomorrow?

&amp;#x200B;

California Covid-19 Update: New Infections Jump 20% Single Day; Record Number Hospitalizations, ICU Patients Deaths could go back using 'Pearl Harbour's. That's used be. Started hear whispers now. 

“Biden going anything covid. Covid get worst. Etc etc.” I’d sign waiver allow film ever admitted hospital. gives shit Trump? 😂 read said tell I’m wrong. I’ll gladly take L information didn’t have. Gotcha. Thanks. Would nice see someone debunk claims sources. Bc said video truth concerning. Well, enough anti-vaxx propaganda millions refuse vaccinated, take quite long.

Yay, guess? Lord mercy souls. People need fucking listen. vaccine coming **doesn't mean** nonchalant it. Wake up, world, still going continue even virus ""calms down"". 

But nobody's gonna listen. going nightmare, like already. Agreed Best luck grandparents, hope they're better wave end reaches zero. second wave happen, covid-19 would resurface woods declared eradicated. problem CV19 even go stay away pubs, restaurants, gatherings, *you still get infected.* may forced go work catch someone went socializing. may live someone refuses follow safety guidelines catch them. 

If people caught died ones reckless, fine, I'd problem that. one works, that's infuriating. sounds....AWESOME! Definitely bucket list ride along storm chasers. boat May wedding postponed last May. Fingers crossed us see major improvements 🤞🏼 supposed inject bleach shine UV lights bum? way. You’re not. I’ve same. I’ve damn lucky situation it’s easy stay home day, honestly happy social pressure go don’t want to. US still handling situation way better.

Source: I'm mexican. 10k people die everyday USA normal times. 

People live \~90 years, that's generous.

With population 328 million, means 3.6 million people die every year US. 

Now 4k people die covid, that's pretty significant increase terrible happens. 10k people died every day since 9/11. people died 9/11/01 natural causes people attacks. What's special 9/11 way died. People getting killed *jumping burning skyscrapers.* Towers collapsing, passengers crashing flight 93. terrible everyone went 9/11 I'd rather die covid die hijacked plane crashing building. everyone tied 9/11 comparisons? Theres plenty death world could compare 9/11 shitty comparison. I, regular 20 year old female, get vaccine,  clearly since u can't seem understand comment 😜  clorox wipes hoarded fly shelves soon stocked people wearing gloves anymore? many days died people 9/11

How many days we've pandemic ? 🤦‍♂️ weird response. that's like least 40 deaths per day... oh mean total 9/11 deaths per day? telling “60 90 days” exacerbate problem. site rated high conspiracies, so.... busy helping get Jesus. want nightmare end. work nursing home. People get nasty virus is. dread going work now. first started, joyful. 

I afraid work going friend's house go anywhere. never understood point comparing tragedies, especially since two completely different. I've multiple family members catch second time less 8 month period, also co-worker catch second time less 6 month period.

It's hard catch twice since antibodies leave system 30 - 90 days. 5 times less per capita? wish, we're around 25k tests day.. whole country 120 Million habitants, us almost 2 million daily! Around 27 freaking times per capita Mexico!!! trial controlled. placebo group vaccination group. monitor patients illness.

If look here, page 30, see number cases time two exposed vaccination sure seems like wouldn’t hard nose swap

How know they're exposed get sick? aware it’s number 1 cause death currently US? logic, stop treating heart disease.  bad we're back line fraction citizens get vaccine know many doses getting? said anything really want know. USA 13th rank GDP per capita behind Singapore lol. Wealthiest what? Overall GDP? Nope thats China.
 
Per Capita household? Nope gini coefficient (measure wealth inequality) also highest ""first world nation"". fact high Id venture say first world nation all. close Mexico far wealth distributed.

We also outrageous education insanely expensive healthcare. Even many developing countries better healthcare systems us.

Covid spread rapidly silently crowded urban slums spread outward number cases made untraceable. healthcare tied employment people go work sick work unsafe crowded environments. People without health insurance forced use ER wait till theyre practically dying seek treatment. still may bankrupted even insurance.

No wonder many deaths high infection numbers. 

Obviously Trump co. failed many levels rot runs far deeper 1 administration. 50+ years making. still think country best anything suggest travelling. symptoms? get tested Covid possible exposure? still carry transfer it

Why would they? Getting vaccine virus past, right? people past longer infecting others. don’t go. Claim exposed go get test instead. vaccine distributed safe so!

When happens tho! one death traced party, life without parole. seems bipartisan support. mainly liberal friends can’t best judge conservative side, think lot people want know someone got vaccine ok get it. It’s strange me, personally. NBA, NFL, MLB... sure vaccine safe? remember talking Wuhan cases January. Never ever thought would get bad, also never thought could get vaccine like this. We’re living history. Honestly pop someone Googles exactly stawman is, textbook. See response actually think think exist, know think that. see read this, know it’s real, still can’t wrap head around it. going ""second thoughts"" *what*? scientists took time agreed safe yesterday. safety issue completely fully litigated agreed experts vaccine safe. going ""second thoughts"" Trump told FDA commissioner quit dicking around final rubber-stamp?

Sounds like someone's really mad Trump, desperately trying pretend Trump's actions meaningful negative impact. won't. Trump smart thing here, actions saved thousands lives. meaningful reason delay single day longer. FDA approves vaccine think CDC needs actually rule okay start injecting people supposed decided Sunday amazing news I’d temper expectations. It’s going take least 6 months enough people get vaccine see substantial decline hospitalizations, especially whatever reason 50% population doesn’t seem want get all. 

Then fact know vaccine protects you, doesn’t protect spreading asymptomatically others. Masks social distancing required, even getting vaccine. 

The good news mental health strain lift considerably. That’s I’m looking forward most, constantly worried well being. Whoa! That's scary! Thinking guys California hope guys stay safe healthy. Italy September-November 2019 somewhat like Sweden March/April, 2020

No. all. 

Sweden bunch ""soft"" measures implemented. Large gatherings prohibited, university higher schools closed, distancing, work home encouraged. IIRC, population mobility dropped severely.. **Hospitals** knew dealing with. Also, Sweden heading summer, Italy heading Winter clear virus prefers colder weather.


Color highly unconvinced. Lab contamination (and mistakes) happen Peak death rate, peak *growth* death rate? see death numbers per day would *drop* that, rate keep increasing quite quickly. sad! covid wasn’t huge deal wasn’t really sick know others aren’t lucky know people lost friends family makes sad K like Americans right thing continue pay price selfish actions others won't. 

Now case I'm lucky worst thing happened able see closest friends family since live immediate area, sadly price pay others much higher.  think lot happens migration.

Ok bro. possible US could theoretically see 200k dead around 75 days now... Jesus.

See kids prioritize basic needs citizens rather Fortune 500 companies, Military. USA does, opposite comes running country. Pro athletes probably back line since pro sports provides minimal societal benefit. That's fact extreme example all. equipment staff get stretched that's exactly winds happening. know? hospital said many doses expecting getting first. conversation nurse today bit mindset. smart one explained opportunity 10 years studies time people dropping like flies around globe, got right away. Sometimes need present optic number cases, amount time, matters vaccine rushed scientifically, managed get massive parallelization going big budget easy access.

Bring proof. new York times imitation website RIP 3 million people, like family 😢 everyone's life ends. sure point is. It’s record, although first wave close maximum 851 cases recorded March 3rd. It’ll also tougher contain wave much spread one massive church cluster. 

Best luck South Korea though! faith you. Word, 400,000 excess deaths probably overlap pandemic total coincidence. Coconuts killing usual.

It’s fault immune systems bombarded everyday forever chemicals healthcare system zero ability proactively provide care.

Yet, can’t wear damn mask go grocery shopping? Ridiculous. It’s joke referencing Aggressive mean persistent, tenacious, unrelenting used context. It’s really tragic people’s lives important enough Trump administration take action.

I cannot fathom gone nation wide strict stay home lockdown many people dying. massacre. NYT also paywalled? Hard ever trust someone pull childish ""I know don't! Pay find out! Neer neer!"" bit.

News cost reader anything. create events they're reporting. often they're even using reporters journalists. They're literally taking work others publishing much bigger name.

Paywalled online news outlets biggest factor led fake news pandemic leads ignorant poor educated rich. No, don't. I'm downvoted pump body full shit? know plenty people gotten flu shots still got flu. There's guarantee vaccine even work, especially one new one.

I thought people said take one ""Trump made""? lab makes it, I'm taking it. Fuck right? body, choice. 9/11 per day keeps socialism away. gave upvote? Probably heard conspiracy theory average age coronavirus deaths higher normal average age death. say alot subs making sound like deadly. 4 people became paralyzed vaccine, yet still claim safe 🤦‍♂️ reason getting voted people tired marginalizing deaths preexisting conditions. people large would led happy lives decades come coronavirus.

Yes, may pre-existing conditions. mean dismiss categorize death reasonable. reasonable. Less that... existence virus announced China December 30th. designed vaccine within days virus sequenced first time. acquaintance, who's retired med school professor, told he'll wait others get vaccine first. He's spring chicken, either. 
Over r/medicine doctor saying talked doctors several institutions *more half* *un*willing get shot. lie longer asking logistical support. Seeing right health care workers senior citizens vaccine target group, likely DOZENS die within days vaccination.

After age 80+, week like % chance death. reason wait, vaccine use delivery method uses antigens, even did, second shot applied antibodies regardless. get jabbed without trouble. Yeah 1,200 went really far🤣🤣🤣 Trump immediately fired Inspector General going oversee dispersal money. small feeling many people want vaccine may problem.

It depends many doses buy. Given passed buying extra 200 million Pfizer vaccine, look hopeful. That's vaccines work. dumb competition. absolute best way (and certainly doable) would score person number people interacted day. Sort list list give shot first interactions. Call 'man middle' vaccination scheme. Check math. 300,000 divided 365 1800 day.

That's nearly 1% US population. sounds pretty nice first week. know literally thousand thousand pages data go through? Scream stupid scream fact vaccine politicized enough already. clearly heard private corporations buy staff, makes another person stand line, pharma companies, dont give fuck, selling companies governments, dont give fuck buys first. Best workers, too! I've worked lots service jobs life, immigrant coworkers best (or least best) workers every job I've had.

That's enough cover broad range severely ill patients,"" hospitals still able help people, Jansens said. infections continued rise, ""it work anymore."" also raised concerns Germany's elderly particularly high infection mortality rates: ""Even come intensive care units age 70 80, mortality intensive care units 80%.""

Germany also averaging 20,000 daily cases ~500 daily deaths. situation Germany seems dire, expected going fall/winter. Godspeed Germany US deaths causes week 43 (late October) last 6 years: 
2020 – 2,653,049 / 331,002,651 = 0.802%

2019 – 2,343,202 / 329,064,917 = 0.712%

2018 - 2,341,112 / 327,096,265 = 0.716%

2017- 2,306,462 / 325,084,756 = 0.709%

2016- 2,239,966 / 323,015,995 = 0.693%

2015 – 2,230,865 / 320,878,310 = 0.695%

2014 – 2,115,029 / 318,673,411 = 0.664%

(deaths / population = death rate)

There slight increase death rate past 6 years. Statistically, year much different. Population increases year, deaths surprising.

It predicted 5 years ago deaths would rise large aging population (Baby Boomers, Silent Generation, Greatest fucking hard, like 10 months...

the effect saying ""this save lives"" really wears really seen family, friends, done anything fun like 10 months. Lmao getting partial herd immunity? one wears mask follows rules. bad thing No, American care environment tried hard, that’s sure whiel anti-maskers wont get say hoax.... fair trade guess. anything? He's right, there's way we're averaging 5k anytime soon. Things bad, talking almost doubling current death rates overnight. think peak likely late January / early February we’ll coming spring much higher baseline cases begin widespread vaccination. frankly, I’m optimistic vaccine uptake disease largely eradicated places masks social distancing. 

I don’t even want mention stuff suffice say: there’s still lot virus don’t understand. We’re going learn time goes on. also wrong way. care environment? F job. I’m sorry grandmother. End summer opinions changed.

Guess else happened end summer? Students went back university hit restrictions.  December already 4th highest deaths behind november, may april. rate persists looking 75-90k month. supposed backup plans case global pandemic lasts year end sight, assistance rent freeze? 

Like, consider bit pessimist, told dining would closed off-and-on year, would probably assumed restaurants pay rent time something... Good news, hopefully rest nation follows trend! Respect. always easy admit wrong. Let's hope things change Sweden, fast. Nah expect fall.   GF came home 7 nights hospital today. 31, normal body weight, glaring comorbidities.  steam rolled her. Double pneumonia. said “this fine, doesn’t harm young people” gotten ER, lord knows kind result would had. case, suffering trauma worst experience lives. it’s sad people can’t seem understand mortality rate tells nothing whole story. I’m going say eventually soon people making like be. TIL stupidity recyclable. implies 33% infected, wow Moderna trial. Arm got shot hurt, like laying lifting certain way, besides side effects.

In end lasted couple days. Like Flu shot really, lasted little longer. Damn , love guy. Really inspired helped change financial situation 600k, thankfully far off. may right nose sadly.

Now prediction full year might come true get shit control. Honest question fuck Apparently people carry epipens allergic reactions vaccines before, yes there's reaction. may approaching time near future mother can’t breathe, father heart attack, grandfather suffering fall, maybe broken hip, may able receive care desperately need,” Wilson said. “This real concern. fact, appears likely not.” Like many people frequent subreddit, I’m pretty sure opposite this. Let see correct.  think essential workers, included, busting earn paycheck take care family nonessentials get paid UBI government stay home taxpayers dime? Wow. feel superior 'knowledge' 'researched' deep enough find something go along general consensus. provides soapbox heard (attention seekers) ones know others lazy 'research' deep enough find truth.  Ah yes, let's wait 2 months equivalent 1x 9/11 per day... Well, lord says either tonight resignation letter. 74M Thanksgiving 2 weeks ago yesterday.. peak hospitalizations ***still*** days away. millions people airports days too.

""what? way. saw Thanksgiving"" going repeated lot next weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

3000 people/day last one ever. idiot? conspiracy theorist? cover situation vial longer usable. Breakage, freezer died, stolen, truck crashes, etc... There's also south america. talking Latin American offended referred home america sister organize several refrigerated trucks house dead back April things piled up.  also come contingency train 911 operators 2 hours many incapacitated. Thankfully said contingency scrapped since then, gives idea bad things 1-2 month period. point graph correct. counting deadly events. say US army deaths civilian deaths. fact seven thousand Americans died Gettysburg. different plans different scenarios. plan disease IFR&lt;0.1% involves mitigation. one suppression.

Who fuck knows picked wrong one everyone back thought IFR 3%... FDA ahead anything shocking. agency took 50 years figure marijuana dangerous. Yeah, I'm sure many young people worried. Sure, super unlikely die, what's combined probability death, hospitalisations, unpleasant symptoms, long covid etc? possible outcomes decent chance something want avoid. mean even getting cold fun, can't imagine getting symptomatic case enjoyable. I'm 34, Covid, diagnosed Glaucoma yesterday virus. even fever cough. Even effect lungs sure get nerves. Suicides likely up. Shootings even homicides doubled cities well. nurse family member said would decline. hate people Christmas keep numbers up. Ho ho ho. see stats this? know 1 per 500 0.2% dumb pay attention anything math except maybe stuff like buy .308 .30-30 even I'd ask someone smarter. Less lines vaccine Nice. People downvoting without really explaining wrong think counter productive

The biggest killer Americans heart disease.  25% deaths due form it.  think we'd agree that's significant. deaths per million 2003.

What seeing place like New Jersey something par that. think worse though.  I'm expert I'm reading right NJ heart disease roughly 1630 per million covid 2005.  There's something ""age adjusted"" understand either way think look NJ covid death rate dismiss easily. really misleading title That's viruses work.

By vaccinating risk, deaths cut dramatically.

About 1% population die exposed Covid. enough vaccine 20 million plus Americans. That's 5% population.

If moved quickly this, could cut deaths *dramatically* vaccinating virtually high-risk population.

Realistically, quickly shipping vaccine would save many thousand lives. shipped month ago likely would saved hundreds thousands lives. Yep, similar calculations.
And probably grows 30-60 million every month.

Can 3-8 months 100% infected US.

Of course vaccinating risk groups drastically reduce deaths. Read dates them. people think now, December, instead August September? Yes. ""pandemic"" part virus exists almost exclusively 65 age bracket. 

But keep mind. Even 90% effective vaccine, vaccinated 70 year old still several times likely die covid19 *unvaccinated* 30 year old. People old serious comorbidities never safe young healthy people unless 100% effective vaccine shows up. Well biggest problem vaccines pharma companies politics combined.

We Belgium supposed X doses Pfizer vaccine January, learnt today delayed February. I'm sure case rest EU US too.

We lower (again) expectations, come eventually know. take longer complications happen months everything stabilizes. research. Thx Well, would likely need PCR antibody tests might positive due vaccine. presume getting antibody tests? Okay. Thanks! happy you. Thank past 9 months. cherry-picking memory. sub place predictions ""facts"". course someone sometime said something turned correct forgetting times we've completely off. look old threads see consensus ""we've always said this"" crowd likes think. It’s simple evolutionary pressure. Polio, smallpox etc required extensive immunisation tracking program eliminate virus. 
But want magic solution. vaccinate part population, unvaccinated part give rise vaccine resistant strains due advantage virus evolve able infect non-susceptible population. 
In honesty treatments going important vaccines achieve global herd immunity, can. helps. I'm means anti-vaxxer. Far it! I'm taking it. Purely long term studies done, can't done.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* that. FDA guideline two shot vaccination. get second dose required time start over. Durant makes sense release now. point indicating opinion conspiracy bullshit? :)  someone exposed Covid suffer mild symptoms, spread virus others recovered symptoms?



The overwhelming majority people symptoms resolve (and minimum 10 days) able spread virus. far someone infected spread virus outdoors winter conditions (cooler air, wind, higher moisture)?

It's really possible answer question high level accuracy, theory could infect someone hundred feet away (though would insanely rare real world) . practice chances start fall quite rapidly distance feet. ethical way determine quantifiable way. Kousyuu region day Kantou months aftershocks (waking 6.0 7.0 aftershocks sleeping 30th floor building 5 flippin' (what seemed like) every day gets real old real quick, let tell ya lol)

Whatever results government's response, one good thing, least: dead number right around 2,000. Considering population density, that's bad. well, cheer loudly COVID doesn’t mean it’ll win testing started March. listen people telling tested properly. protocols followed, difference skipped lot beuracratic steps. vaccine absolutely safe, thing people need move past pandemic. keeps 3k/day rate, we'll doubled total end winter. me. state got shit together.  good news Americans europeans. rest world living semi normal life year hard lockdowns. Finally, kind light end tunnel! I've inside since pretty much January whole thing started (I'd recovering 2 surgeries anyway) March started taking off, felt safest stay home since underlying conditions. 

This trying, also illuminating year relation humanity. way, I'm glad allowed people show true colors reveal selfish truly know associate them. 

Thank everyone who's they're supposed taking thing seriously, especially healthcare workers who've working tirelessly this. Santa natural immunity Covid, according Fauci. you’ve got bunch traumatized kids thinking Santa might die doesn’t get vaccine. stuff give iodine based contrast part job. risk allergic reaction like stuff get injected system. amount people die severe reaction pretty rare. 

My concern rush vaccinate people take precautions care small amount people might reaction. really appreciate explanation - wondering could speed process much, makes sense!

Perhaps speak another concern? know long term safety vaccine? disease known year so, obviously long range data. assume studies continue determine long vaccine remains effective, need booster shots need new one every year like flu shot? 

I read something beginning pandemic failed vaccine attempts SARS MERS due cytokine storms vaccinated people exposed virus months later. I'm curious know know happen vaccine? part ""It's everywhere, easy test"" answer?

Thank you! goal never eradicate mate D) know... hospitalized dying alone ventilator follow simple, easy follow guidelines. would Floridans get vaccine?? cant help dont want helped. raised catholic even though I'm atheist bad things say catholic communities people. parents always religious never pressured anything. Even can't gain anything believes think community truely gain society. pay 45% taxes yet afford spend rest money poor countries funds help abused people. selfless humble people know, like many catholic communities get recognition deserve. point information available vaccine less science vaccine.

We live Information Age. actually means average person google life’s sought questions rather get degree science question in. “google” original question, results flattering. “google” “is covid-19 vaccine safe long term”? first article Goodrx pops up: reading article there’s troubling conclusions. 1. people won’t serious side effects, don’t really know serious side effects 2. Yes there’s risk taking vaccine, it’s better dying vaccine 3. give statistics people got side effects didn’t show details got (for obvious reasons). last point compare details statistics vaccine statistics covid healthy individuals age 40, appears riskier get vaccine not. again, based simply googling assuming you’re age 40- coupled idea may working home limited contact people. says article, people get vaccine, data available. sounds terrifying. 

My main point science vaccine, rather means information projected, information available, people see it. misinformation comes covid-19 they’re still finding drastically new different things weekly/ monthly basis. It’s flu, it’s vaccine won’t either. mean? one woman baby nine months, clearly nine woman 1 month. :D UPS FedEx next day delivery every day decades. military experience infrastructure mass scale could taken well year get point could compete. Italy??!?!?! thought evil chinese influence WHO.  281,000 new cases. Jesus fucking Christ Wow, 9 months. didnt know! already know percentage people expected actual immunity. Think it, spend vaccine person yet ever receive vaccine, gain overall rate population immunity tested someone readministered vaccine. advantage latter. Username checks (kinda) trying distract exact headline browsing TikTok (I know, know, needed utterly vapid entertainment). There's significant portion people saying similar stuff. Worrying. guess least people normally associate get it, least there's that. might dead take lol That’s wearing masks way important stupid 6 ft distance rule. mean like maganation's micro&amp;soft boi would do? Bill Gates great guy, motive anything nasty. Besides, think microchips even going do? work? assume people go back normal they’re fully vaccinated, think many places start open open soon bare minimum vulnerable people vaccinated. can't get flu vaccine either, barring botched manufacturing dead weakened virus vaccine, would extremely rare. mean least people don’t fear lives, quite opposite, don’t even take seriously. It’s going battle convince enough people get vaccinated. thanks news corp (news.com.au owned news corp).

Since ones calling full reopening borders Earlier year, two diners South Korean restaurant infected novel coronavirus matter minutes third patron sat least 15 feet away them. third patron asymptomatic time.


That’s first sentence article replying to.

Your certainty get covid from20 ft away seems unwarranted know catch greater 15 ft. Why? wife speculated end flu pandemic may actually cause Roaring Twenties. might right may repeat it. guess would ER ICU anyone works areas time, everyone else. 

Our institution going based upon time worked covid covid possible people. example DC. getting 7000 doses 84,000 healthcare workers. mention want start vaccinating vulnerable people too. 

Story Maryland get 150,000 doses cover half healthcare workers. healthcare worker admit bit torn. compassionate part wants vulnerable people get vaccinated also think healthcare workers really need vaccine now. 9 months PPE still scarce. rationed. wearing n95 masks far longer intended. 

And even blue Maryland, still people bitching masks. Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. one is, moment, looking like great candidate use countries can't afford / unable stored two. ready yet though. consider pope right wing religious nut job. 

But yes, lot called christians country, USA, seems right wing nut jobs. Idk, stayed yet Yet red lobster packed. Actually, 118,000,000,000,000/330,000,000 = 357,575.76. But, population adults. Bill Gates makes $28,333 per minute. Compare working poor country make year. would fine giving everyone million dollars. staggering shots workplace. know one local hospital making sure division breaks staff that, instance, ER staff don’t get vaccinated day. one hand, coroners probably getting good recognizing dying severe covid probably test suspected cases. 

On other, already clear undercount excess deaths even without overflowing hospitals. probably gets magnified hospitals full. might already seeing places like El Paso. never know full death count though undoubtedly many academics making estimates. answer may little little B. Hm True even busiest highways America’s response Covid surprised you, you’re rough years. got bad feeling vaccine thing won’t pan well. There’s way many people won’t take feed ego. needs higher, well said agree

I spent quarantine spending time family gaining new skills.

Looking forward playing bass band soon. Going travel family more.

 time reminded us always self improve appreciate every day. Yea I'm pointing statistics work. could blind folded, put ear plugs even asleep wheelchair pushed across highway still survive statistically. treatment American prisoners almost crime humanity. prisons Texas higher fatality rate GULAGs fucking Stalin... Or... Yah know, put pandemic team place stop disease spreading nation's start get control (like use have), making long term Pandemic plans update frequently (like use have), preparing PPE stockpiles case emergency (like... use have?)... setting generally robust medical system comprehensive covers everyone.

 


Oh! inoculate population anti-science, anti-medicine predilections. Well, elected officials also want ignorance taught schools. critical thinking can’t teach creative/critical thinking might go children taught home. It’s circular logic problem it’s difficult one solve elite don’t want really educate people. Sure teach people read write get life. Maybe basic math that’s it. I'll get qny vaccine soon approved q country Russia, UK, US congress refused pass stimulus bills save small businesses blame. avoidable. elderly parents told skipping friend's annual holiday party day eyes almost popped head. mean skipping? ""We're feeling festive year since Mort [their poker friend] got COVID hospital."" happening? ""Yeah! ordered food, sent invites."" elderly parents, elderly friends. really cold they're old, there's chance socially distant, outdoor event. Yeah, people going keep dying. pit....every hospital make havent already. Theres choice. arent enough health care workers handle this. one volunteer globally everyones drowning disaster.

Hospitals absolutely choice triage patients..and let sickest die snd save healthy. unbelievable. yep, post thanksgiving weekend wave hardly even started felt hospitals yet already obligated ID go that'd less new imposition make look. thing moment asked show certain reasons (reasonable suspicion, buying alcohol tobacco, entering night club). Misleading title. data masks, mask mandates. essentially unenforced.  virus blooms winter months, would seem. I’m gonna post video. do, I’m gonna preface this: I’m saying man saying clip true, false. gonna ask: Nobel prize winning-creator PCR test saying Fauci doesn’t know he’s talking formally Sounds like regular med got pushed, maybe faster supposed, caused reaction, needed go floor monitoring.
Trust it’s way work transfer someone another unit keep someone ulcerative colitis shift I'm sorry, I've tried explaining things like multiple people just. don't. listen. tried multiple times explain people local news page evidence Bell's palsy caused vaccine, even is, non life threatening condition. care. think they're strong enough get virus, get vaccine, one 4/30,000 people gets Bell's palsy. commend rosy view talking average vaccine hesitant citizen, nobody listens facts anymore. fearmongering fearmongering. haven;t even begun close peak post Thanksgiving wave hitting hospitals, bam Christmas, bam News Years. end January see peak New Years Christmas COVID wave least month returning back down. say end February, statistics brutal lucky What’s latest Moderna? seems Pfizer pulling lead. fear prediction rather accurate.. Depends much distance you’re covering, it’s steps could rely sound way get enough people willing vaccinate achieve herd immunity without incentive. good microeconomics. 

Is he? Advice paying debt microeconomics. Interesting. looks like Aviptadil useful pneumonia already set in, could one-two punch using something like proxalutamide reduce incidence lung progression aviptadil clear faster. 

reference read /ClaraGayle referring to: I’m telling you, US going hit 5,000 deaths day NOTHING long. takes longer that, first transmissions show up, see significant increase another week, college asymptomatic kids go visit family's Christmas. end January going explosive. Vaccine nothing Healthcare staff nursing home staff. general population see vaccine en mass mid February. Spreading false propaganda saying people problem B people huge part problem.

Good luck. There's awful lot people putting weird stock idea 2020 kind new beginning.  Yep, roughly incidence would expect Bell's palsy occur general pop, indicating \*probably\* vaccine related. desantis wants cry foul he’s letting shit rage unchecked months. message him. parents born Portugal. way change this? I'll talk tonight it. So, might dead right now. 99% chance alive time see this. migiht dead right understand. worry soon people get common side effects, they’ll freak tell friends vaccine horrible put off, etc. agree point. noticed many posts year 100+ aged people surviving covid. know they're reported they're statistically cool. I'm sure there's plenty 70, 80, 90+ survivors sell headlines nicely triple digit survivors. Yep! So, answers several questions here:

(1) produced early risk needed badly. Vaccine manufacturers started making back March, hoping would work, got approved needed quick rollout. 

(2) true company can't held liable. Many companies say specific reason this, going guess, probably case asking can, due crisis hand. US, example actually laws books companies liable product helping public health crisis, particularly new. makes feel better, though, need remember massive PR crisis company would face blatantly dangerous vaccine market, well every regulator approved it. Pfizer would never survive company vaccine hurt people, vaccine would ever public trust UK, Canada, USA etc. work. true can't sued, that's indication vaccine unsafe. General ""I'm coming something"" symptoms mostly result immune system going ""alright lasses laddies, go.""

So yes likely. Yikes. Sorry asked questions! article May 6. Now...in response action many months ago...

this true Thank thoughtful response, wholeheartedly agree better vaccinate COVID worry unknown side effects (which likely mild any). several vaccines coming market next year wonder people choose amongst selection vaccine highest efficacy / lowest side effects personal health, age, genetics.  Thousands people’s doctors reporting patients continue suffer symptom, struggle breath heart rate goes isn’t anecdotes, it’s evidence.

How think get evidence medical problems?

Planning around science tells us would taking we’re seeing account, we’re seeing lasting damage.  Excellent news, still far over. Still plenty vaccines left approved general public going seeing April. winter first part Spring still going rough. It’s definitely worth monitoring, numbers look entirely possible chance.

[NIH says Bell’s Palsy happens 40,000 people US every year. Divide US population 330 million, multiply 18,000 people placebo control arms trial, see arm “should” got 2 cases.

So, one way look vaccine arm two extra cases beyond expected, placebo arm two *fewer* cases expected. Even don’t remember deal standard deviations statistics voodoo, it’s pretty intuitive it’s likely unlikely placebo arm two fewer cases expected vaccine arm two expected. wonder they're lobbying Mitch liability shields? brain sucks.

Just take look kids right see go, get worse here. Nearly one empathy compassion anymore boosting fragile ego means necessary Literally tangerine ""we testing more"" excuse believe main thing trial measured number people symptoms. that's main measurement ""the vaccine reduces symptoms"" possibly claim make certainty. trials assess one dose thus cannot confidently say much provides level (the CI around one dose fairly large) protection around 2-3 weeks. possible protection one dose faded much faster two doses. 

Thus FDA authorize vaccine indicated one dose. 

Some individuals may choose get second dose time unadvisable without knowing more. unrelated hate every TV segment vaccines feels need include footage people receiving shots.

You mean lots evidence

You mean Way better plan around long term damage finding resolves, opposite.

No. better plan around science tells us, rather supposition. Said another reply similar comment,

I think poor take; even warp speed head said expects us normal May, Fauci thinks hit ""relative normal"" April-July. Warp speed expects vaccinate 100 million people end February, encompass at-risk people healthcare workers would mostly halt pandemic tracks. We're also looking hundreds millions doses somewhere first months next year. multiple vaccines giving us doses, Pfizer (the vaccine company mentioned unable give us vaccinations past June). definitely depend country, regardless May-June range seems reasonable normalcy estimate, opinion. I’m ever hopeful, think summer 2021 US real sense something like “normal” best case. 

However, SADLY, many nations appear slated wait fucking YEARS vaccine. sincerely hope situation (delivery vaccine poorer countries, etc) ends going better predicted, man look grim right now. Yeah I'm sure said that, definitely seeing first round infections subsequent daily cases now. Maybe meant terms death toll? average lag period 22 days. It’s many professions, utter ignorance spewed people capable going motions job, don’t actually understand it. same...

Too many people go vacation florida July august it’s big chunk economy that’s DeSantis blocked push would harm come November election I’m saying can’t call worst pandemic ever looking absolute numbers. Cause 1918 pandemic happened current population 2 million people would died.

And pandemic mostly killed young people worse. thought widely thought would take years get back semblance normal vaccine release? Umm. 

The phrase “a crime humanity” means it’s crime offends humanity. 

Not one committed humans. 

So, opposite way you’re interpreting man weekly podcast called Osterholm Update: Covid19 I've listening since July cannot recommend enough. thumb pulse pandemic start provided lot sanity me. Hearing go saying ""There's way we're getting vaccine soon"" ""we may actually get vaccine soon"" ""Yo we're getting vaccine ya'll need accept nice!"" thing that's given hope. Like soothsayer saying ""I think I'll able take kids baseball game July,"" helps.   refrain eating public places.

I'm OP, reading comprehension one that's piss-poor, mine.

You could take comment either:
1. mouth breather can't read answer poor guy's question OR
2. clearly spend time Reddit insulting intelligence others point comments white noise.

Either way, right. Probably enough time pass majority us able get anyway, hopefully information vaccine, possible side effects etc. dilution open air.

Talking loudly salivating food, contaminating plates cutlery huge loads saliva might still make high risk setting. seriously doubt they're holding shots reserve people want them. almost seriously doubt they're holding shots reserve people's second doses.

This done state-by-state though there's 50 different wheels invented. Reinfection eschewed rare event months, elderly, weak immune systems.

This article gives support theory reinfection common believed. Prisoners commonly neither elderly compromised immune systems. strongly dispute ""California lockdown mode since March."" couple months ago, basically everything open except amusement parks (not all) schools. People indoor dining, even bars strip clubs reopened ""indoor dining"". ""lockdown mode.""  need realize business NEVER reopen pandemic (bars, gyms, amusement parks) business need financial support end pandemic. position one wants sacrifice government refuses pay people. school work absolutely obsessed getting student desks EXACTLY 6' apart. student gets COVID sat &lt; 6' another student, they'd get notified, exactly 6' (or more), apparently need notification whatsoever.

Of course, teachers get notified all, because... reasons? Vaccines help Yes fewer usual deaths influenza still way death total normal.

The excess deaths probably related COVID unless something else happening cause extra deaths says hospital system teeters edge overwhelmed. know studies fact masks keeping 6 feet distance work since summer. people refuse google claim studies exist. original estimate 1 2 million dead.

With vaccine, hopefully keep million.

I think 750,000 looks right vaccine effective.

I never imagined would much resistance vaccines masks. Lol thinking they’ll get vaccine.

I feel though friend, stay safe.  problem federal setup Germany. many important fields, states power central government plead beg. prime example. you’re sick covid symptoms already quarantining, even point getting tested? think yes please explain state adopted philosophy open attend risk, demand masks dont worn continue call hoax. cases top US population. hospital work stretched capacity staff like stressed beyond belief.

I'm right, right? Yeah talked said could born there. weren't, there's chance.

And could, could have, too. Where's citizenship? don’t know, guessing I'm glad people moving away states government arbitrarily close business strategy even worked control virus. least freedom. simple, public wiling wear mask long term. want welcome voluntary entire outdoor mall places open, I’m mistaken. entire point stuff open, even limited. closer go LA proper outdoor dining takeout only.

We're nowhere close designing molecular olfaction sensors like nature does. gotten quite proficient building spectrometers generally quite expensive, fragile, portable, need paired gas chromatogram much art science. results generally need manually interpreted.

So yeah, we've got nothing dogs. Idaho truly sick careless place. get flu cold, start feeling shitty often stay home, possibly bed, chances spreading lot lower. (Unless work insecure job need work keep job pay bills. Or, work company expected turn however feeling.) quickly symptomatic.

With COVID-19 many people asymptomatic. actually ill contagious, feel it, still go therefore spread further.

So, even asymptomatic, still ill probably contagious. contact someone ill tests positive - even feel fine - please stay home, get tested, definitely wear mask.

Good luck hope see living best life :) Spoiler alert: happens first injection well, least janssen vaccine. Source: participated got vaccinated ensemble study it.

24 hour fever, headaches, chills, fatigue, soreness. Make sure don’t work next day.  assumption would anyone underlying conditions mild enough wouldn’t know them, wouldn’t part 90% people died underlying conditions. Maybe that’s wrong though, either way fair point. It’s hard assess risk level could something don’t know several kind reinfection:
 
- somehow recovered person seroconverted, either got mild symptoms reason
 
- reinfection milder symptoms body already know produce antibody.. similar vaccine completely protect infection protect disease (symptoms) heard nurses say anything I'm moron goes hospital pandemic sick people are. wonder situation.  Moderna, please. can’t test happens time without time passing though. me. would take federal government offer bounty police enforce mandatory mask mandate person caught wearing mask. $1000 arrest anyone caught wearing mask public $250 reward information leading arrest someone wearing mask. I’ll let know well works since think I’ll get public temperature screener. Lots people underlying conditions they're aware of, making impossible accurately judge risk. get downvoted stating scientists saying vaccine. People want lies. hate facts like support narrative. don’t care facts feelings don’t matter comes facts. born different generation guess. Remember said Trump could prevented 90% total deaths? Looks like that's going 10% since kind us going forward became aware stat. ""The F.D.A.’s decision followed extraordinary sequence events Friday morning White House chief staff, Mark Meadows, told F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, consider looking next job didn’t get emergency approval done Friday, according senior administration official spoke condition anonymity""

Okay. start getting concerned?

What mean? objectively wise thing do. realise UAE USA military economic allies, right?  different live there. live LA I'm shocked people come see ocean. held hope humanity. don’t really hope anymore. Wearing mask walking outside ridiculous Oh god literal Look downvotes too. Kinda crazy. Especially you’re 100% right. 1010110% THIS....and they'd rather steal working classes money. can't get help Republicans THERE'S NOTHING MARCH PROTEST.

We 2 societies, 2 different America's (no North South)...if $$$, live lavishly America. not, work butt mind death get paycheck paycheck. 

Judicial system...same thing

Health Care...same thing

It's time middle road, time change America towards equality tear rebuild. good way explain it. BUTT MUH' FREEDUM!! Lol. Thank you! wish thought response clever this. Yeah, I've seen ""enclosed outdoor dining"" spaces outside. We've got term I'm from; ""Inside"". wonder countries metric system lower infection rates. Two meters closer six half feet. didn’t even read check it. Yet still decide comment say know is? Shameful. Guess weren’t paying much attention college (or middle school? Sheesh.)

It links articles, medical journals sources. text highlights. read confirmed.

Where personal responsibility. Question may able answer? giving vaccine people already Covid? Typical someone whose screen name “vacuous decay” respond critique it’s garbage it’s “text only” “no formatting”

I mean, pretty pictures, right? Whoever gilded post Wholesome Award, ~~you beat it~~ insensitive fuck Sexually transmitted vaccinations. cool would whoever gets vaccinated spread vaccine others sex might weird mention go Tik Tok read comment feel lonely. refreshing see many people call others masks things. [I've waiting  Maybe yes, maybe no. needs studied, soon possible. I’m aware. Pfizer created vaccine viagra. vaccine actually hurt viagra business. Try end 2022 beginning 2023... don’t quick assume like everyone done since started. Lol it’s hurried assumptions. patience. need examples individuals suffering like this. Psychologically, people less affected large statistics hearing individual stories certain point. Nobody wants live like this. going raise hopes nothing. I’m proceeding caution that’s all. time eradicate virus proliferated unmanageable numbers widespread. window opportunity long gone. Every country stamped early decisively, bickering mixed messages. Americans need come together one unified force thing never control. Let Covid lesson cooperating together. fail, fail future generations. don’t learn this, end us. historically splits countries. Ideologies radically opposing nation better two. Everything trump. You’re obsessed. Reddit obsessed. okay? please formulate comment doesn’t revolve around Trump? It’s unhealthy obsession aren’t evaluating messages information, you’re investigating agenda emotion. It’s sad watch community deteriorate wrong-think zombies. Yes, appears random, research advances know less less random.

Example already know overweight diabetes risk factor. I’d prefer shot Pfizer. Make double! UK ordered far needs understanding excess would go third world countries. ridiculous companies relinquish control AZ so? selling cost sure they're allowing anyone wants produce Agreed definitely certainty would huge pass. Believe won’t data 2 shot vaccine months 1 shot vaccine. Awesome part trial! ~~Pro-Life~~ Pro-Birth. How’s everybody doing? true! grandpa died year, 90. young fight WW2 11 entered war. fight Korea. I’m saying “respectful, tolerant left” isn’t every conservative leaning person is, it’s trump lackies. don’t even really know mean, seems like think owned me, okay. Americans died COVID WWII. equivalent ~6,100 cases whole US normalised population size. Sorry, im married That's really accounting near healthcare collapse northeast spring. closer area gets healthcare capacity line higher deathrate climbs. scary part seen complete overtopping yet, like magic force field exactly six feet virus can't cross get you. meant get people spread breathe directly other. quite literally least try prevent spread disease. like living north east people come look leaves.. Except know, leaves dont usually kill you... Usually... THIS!!! know sick leave considered BIO terrorism tossed jail $10,000 fine. I’m huge fan program. stories people working there? First really rare. Quick goggle search gives ""Most people eventually make full recovery Guillain-Barré syndrome, sometimes take long time around 1 5 people long-term problems. vast majority people recover within year. people may symptoms years later, rare."" 20% may long term issues might gait issue nerve damage maybe paralyzed, paralyzed vegetative state, even medically appropriate term anymore. Im paraplegic something similar get fine life, society attitudes make life difficult times. "" coworkers teachers,principals "" kept coming room literally standing top desk,like 5 time chatting away"" 

Yeah you° know politely kept getting walking hallway,stay away desk. GOD GOOOOOD!!! No, wrong. Confirmed cases fraction true infections. calculating Case Fatality Rate (CFR), i.e. deaths / confirmed cases. looking Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) i.e. deaths / total actual infections, estimated, best estimates &lt;1%, probably closer 0.6% so, varies wildly age.

Here one latest meta studies published IFR covid looked 27 different studies: estimated age-specific IFR low children younger adults (e.g., 0.002% age 10 0.01% age 25) increases progressively 0.4% age 55, 1.4% age 65, 4.6% age 75, 15% age 85. cousin best lay ever had. Totally would risk it. purely averaged numbers it’s 1.48, considering people world 50, [only 9% people chance die nowhere near 1 50, saying 80 year olds 1 5 chance die complete lie. People 80 don’t 20% Covid death tate much adderall 7k people average died per day 2018 exposed 6 feet works keep moving masked. standing still, recommend without N95. That's literally exactly n95's meant for. Protecting people workplace. people go war since ww2. Boooo! (Also idiots article) funniest part article experts saying 'a glass champagne' hurt.

The advice meant binge drinkers ensure vaccine takes. study actually showed infected person AIR CONDITIONER able infect someone 21 feet away restaurant direction air flowing. words, without air conditioner running, would happened 5 minutes. mean would happen.

Thank god. Need get back god damn gym I’m also moderna trial likely received real vaccine. sucked 12 hours fine. scale 1 10 would put suckage 5. People going need toughen fuck up. I’ve hangovers worse.   11 day lag, deaths actually peaked 24th went bit week after. might temporary, confirmed cases still rising, really can't say certain getting worse. People ICU also last three days. singular event tv specific villain behind it. people scattered across country, hidden hospitals nursing homes dying something can't see. person here, another here. one defeat.   I’m saying almost data March February, assuming spread like coronaviruses made sense, turned true. Focusing messaging airborne need masking day 1 would saved hundreds thousands millions lives.

Now evidence causes long lasting complications, work there, practice caution try figure common severe complications are. 

Does make sense you?

Ignoring things you’ve done studies beyond stupid great way 6 months beyond fast moving crisis. forget also death counties year Japan included. think it’s high exposure (at least US). Think like this, it’s 90% effective means would’ve caught 10 times it’s 1 time. nurses there’s still good likelihood could get treat many patients it. doubly bad still presumably spread even though vaccinated, would likely super spreaders. probably could wear surgical masks instead N95s day though. say like welcome anticipate it. 
The point won’t permanent. history pandemics shows las species we’re willing ultimately compromise gregarious nature  allow us vaccines televise major sports stars receiving theirs. 

That might actually quite helpful improve uptake. Let people see athletes get vaccinated continue super athletic TV. 

Just yet. Maybe highest priority 20% vaccinated, get PR shots help *last* 20%. Oof We’ve deaths 9/11 now..... sibling, nurse behinds scene lab tech kinda person, getting vaccine end month. still required wear mask little data vaccinated person could still carry/spread corona. Buddy elf would like one someone count amount times hand left house anything including food drink gas. may gotten due pressure leave things needed. embarrassingly stupid age. Moderna’s vaccine 94% effective doesn’t require ultra cold storage like Pfizer/biontech one does. feeling wouldn’t. That’s wear masks try avoid crowds necessary. Yea one earlier posts neighbor like this. watched church complained internet church uses science degree. seem fall deep end. pastor isn’t going part problem using brain god intended maybe church isn’t you. pastor even mentions great gift brain maybe use it. Why, may ask? Bell’s Palsy gave steroids it. went away 3 weeks, case people.  Eating kind sucked kept biting inside cheek hard talk coherently. definitely worst thing medically that’s happened me. would rather Covid. Nobody ever died visited ICU Bell’s Palsy. There’s even link Bell’s Palsy vaccine anyway. live Seattle. *Literally* people wear masks indoors toddlers infants (at least experience). even then, sometimes older toddlers wearing masks.

There even conversation amongst family going get together Christmas Thanksgiving. Everyone knows safe. Instead we're going quickly pickup presents grandma's yard, go home Skype family. J&amp;J Jan would dream give us super tool COVID fight. single-shot vaccine without cold requirements. J&amp;J infrastructure manufacture like crazy. Sounds like talking ass. Yeah, preprint. However there's respectable authors. Oh, possible society much much worse long time. Last read late 2021 significant vaccine distribution. handful countries took seriously, worst over. However, keep way remaining cautious. hand, take slightest improvement mean time open up. fall right back toilet pissed figure harder climb time. Isn’t already happening? Ha bell front desk ring? need count days happens Quality governance matters. sad see happens next depend individual behaviours. Politician laws supposed things. America needs lockdown like Europe. save tens thousand deaths (and kill economy). Worth it. guaranteed. he'll raise taxes somewhere cover breaks Trump handed out. I’m pretty sure that’s bought Option. Generally business contracts agree (purchase) Option something future, like, “when another 100 million doses, get first dibs.” neither party wants money actually change hands it’s sure thing sides effs book-keeping valuations liabilities bunch stuff cursory knowledge actually think this? Surgical masks, yes, protect patients. N95s personal protection. vaccine, could theoretically reduce personal protection level something comfortable. Wearing N95 long causes skin bruise possibly bleed. meant worn 10 hours straight every day. Want bet repubs congress everything block legislation complaining lack action? person became infected COVID-19 5 minutes distance 21 feet. Six feet distance may protect COVID-19. That's really accounting near healthcare collapse northeast spring. closer area gets healthcare capacity line higher deathrate climbs. scary part seen complete overtopping yet, Exactly, good authority innate immunity he's pushing front line vaccine short supply???

What hole .... /s

Really though, I'm PR campaign serves interest public safety. mean he's doctor though. used medical judgement matter told. *runs burning house*

It's problem now!!! Good news. Pfizer approved week. Hopefully, Moderna approved next week. Johnson Johnson hopefully approved Jan (another 100M vaccines single shot without strict cold requirements). hold true, could realistically vaccinate around 200M around May minimize COVID fatalities flu levels US. go grocery store ride bike. never walk outside. alone. Stay strong. easy. imagine view life movie protagonist. plot armor. Nothing bad could happen you. Maybe family members, that's part growth arc, part ""God's plan,"" *you* could never die become seriously injured, chronic pain, etc. entire world runs perspective. things care things objectively important. know something understand it, important probably exist all. 2 people previously known severe allergic reactions degree carry adrenaline pen them. allergic medication susceptible. Penicillin common allergic to, one common antibiotics. he's told without using medical judgement he's useless thought South Korea eliminated virus. /s world war raging.  
I don’t think combatant nations shared much press impact pandemic individual nations fear exposing perception weakness enemies (national security concerns).   
Spain wasn’t involved talked media. Hence called th “Spanish Flu”. us non-Americans see \[possibly\] hundreds thousands anti-vaxers, hoax/conspiracy theorists, ""muh body, muh choice"" types permanent stumbling block effective vaccination campaign.

It may decades countries willing believe US eliminated potential endemic risk.

I hope find strength hang there. agree,I think using way get people realize numbers. Nobody seems understand high numbers are. numb it,and kinda realize. see age specific rates site referenced. age independent rate well? that's comes ~98% survival USA. 9/11 meme kinda cringe 3 million Americans die regular year. 

ThAtS tWo HaLf 9/11S DaY. looking the.... Let's call ""ideal"" (or real/ platonic) deathrate. That's deathrate get covid patient admitted hospital there's bed waiting, there's adequate well rested medical staff shortage medicine equipment. deathrate ""flatten curve"" about. get closer closer healthcare capacity line deathrates climb. Staff exhausted, equipment (surge beds) sub par etc etc play part increasing deaths.

New Jersey hit line spring, go wrong. enough medical equipment, enough space, enough staff. many people got sick looks like going happen again.

I hear lot people saying things like ""we sure got lucky covid bad Spanish flu"". I'd argue took away medical advances since 1918 see hell lot deaths covid. What's wrong that? rushed vaccine. actually know happen extremely comforting. read this? published study. Every day feels like say “Et Tu, Brute?” Actually person Surprised desantis isn’t telling everyone florida need vaccine control definitely don’t listen data scientists tell otherwise risk short long term complications (some irreversible) getting COVID way higher okay way ever know; I'm curious many people decide get that.  I've known Russians time must kind joke. Russian going take advice seriously. what? Widespread vaccination Mostly.

As time, Iowa reported 43 total deaths actually occurred December, 28 1st 2nd. (They reported 77 deaths today, 99 yesterday, 102 day that, ~275 deaths, least ~230 November before.)


The end November showing ~40 deaths day, still rising day day.

There significant reporting delay.

Illinois also delay, although quite long understand it, haven’t seen great data show long delay is. God, gonna 9/11 times 100... Ok. brought allergic reactions like valid reasons question vaccine. Maybe overstated position slashed analogy made wasn’t comparable. made seem saying something completely different saying now.

I seeing anti covid antivax antimaskers conspiracy theorists jumping two reported UK cases, already. This. 

Astonishing. 

My wife shocked son got sick disease vaccine still young get hell thankfully baddddd two months recovered. 

We quickly told friends kids situation, encouraged get vaccine many others too. 

The collective response was, “well ya, it’s bad, kid lived. vaccine would probably killed caused Autism. can’t take gamble precious gem.” 

Made realize society moves forward thanks 10-30% population rest drags us back. quote really got well. That’s insulting. Technically speaking, nationwide, we're kinda third wave. initial onset cases March/April, slight flattening May, upward trending June/July, slight downward trend fall, we're fucking skyrocketing per-day cases since late October.

The problem definite downward trends nationwide, flattened resurging upwards again. use years ago. Great idea. Horrible implementation... american, self-medicate doctors appointments hard get, they’re expensive, increase anxiety, never ever seem end get ball rolling. 

When you’re stuck inside, anxious time—well, anxious usual, it’s hard break bad habits pick healthier lifestyle choices. Especially since pandemic affected sense time. feel like i’m still trapped early april it’s almost january. 

I know people picking new hobbies skills pandemic; far I’m concerned, people freaks. Loud exceptions rule we’re miserable stuck. barely motivation job virtually. cant see family friends, cant go places want go I’m worried infection, I’m going keep eating garbage, keep drinking getting high couch. 

There incentive change bad habits year, especially since material conditions America getting worse worse. Anyone who’s telling chip up, get ass start moving besides boss fire scold leave alone. People wear masks, wash hands, stay inside avoid gatherings. that, i’m going keep toughing out, bad habits all. talking about? lockdown ended ppl's minds soon BLM/Floyd protests erupted attention shifted social justice matters. sectors grooming, fitness, dining &amp; entertainment (large-group gathering) closed. People continue go back office complexes. Loaning businesses doesn’t always work, depending industry. Gyms going much fewer participants. may able make sufficient income still able pay back loans. might take years businesses fully pay back loans. 

I think “loans” forgivable. shoud've helped politicians wanted financially support shutdown

Who know gym owner voted for? start handing licences people voted 'right' party?

Also thinking corporate neolib going give shit lol vaccine tested people who’ve COVID? hard shut last spring, local gym set Discord account streaming workouts. Anyone kept membership active got join in. Kept personal trainers employed (via virtual one one sessions), kept class instructors employed, etc. Lots us gladly kept paying fees. people live different world us, drive back home get mask rewashed forgot put back car, go convenience store. taxing giving money government good with, add whole new set issues though. There’s guarantees best way getting social good back money that’s accruing somewhere, person government agency. Gates definitely questionable times, he’s good world now, appreciate help it’s bringing people. would prefer general strike, democrats could lead really wanted get Mitch GOP budge, government shutdown, latter would better nothing. People fucking hungry, un- underemployed, sleeping streets, eviction moratorium runs end year get exponentially worse. solution virus pay people stay home get everyone vaccinated. I’m saying would easy, facilitate this, party could exhaust little power/leverage have. Instead Pelosi going record saying take worse deal one rejected months ago Biden election, showing $10k ice cream freezers going hair salon telling others stay home. terrible optics party’s top leadership. Forgive thinking deserve better! That's running entirely hypothesis, fact. government official thinks make arbitrary edicts business operate go fuck off.  messing people’s livelihoods. need better. better mean put place rules business must follow order operate. instance, Washington state indicated gyms must close. gyms must conform following guidelines, send official, evaluate businesses ability conform new rules. instance, indoor gym need x sq ft per person circulating air outside. official verify setup. Again, something federal government doing. People seem like choice business life really don't. hospital space treat people certain point. way covid works, can't wait hospitals filled shut down. point, already 2, 3 weeks behind infected people might need go hospital. would nice people stopped protesting bitching mayor's governor's demanded congress get real relief businesses suffering. vaccine make dent cases months. nothing really going change maybe around March, April, vaccination effort decent amount people vaccinated. remember back May, small, rural county handful cases deaths. Masks stay-at-home policies became running joke almost everybody. that, mean every conversation heard overheard like HS students complaining mean Principal stupid rules. even adults grey haired seniors. 

Now we're nearly 1,000 cases 7 deaths, deaths happening days apart. Yet alarming number people still stores manning cash registers mask on.

I (in 2 high risk covid groups) need go get essentials soon. intend arrive town 7 AM, get fuck fast possible. want stay safe high risk demographic gets clearance vaccinated. 

And feel zero guilt vaccinated months ahead people walking around stores town without mask on. r/darwinawards graph reply speaking [Sputnik V going combined British AstraZeneca Chaddox Vaccine promise paid table ""helping out"" loophole parents live small town. saw new mural put up. Small world They’ll still owe money period made money. It’s net loss business paper thing margins can’t afford. Maybe money feds gave mega corporations gone small businesses???? now? feel bad businesses got shut taking seriously.

You get pick choose businesses financially support basis whether 'doing enough', vague goalpost. derives power sucking life unborn children, that's they're one hand feel bad businesses forced shut hand know multiple gyms ""Covid ia BS wear masks"" whole time. would hope. can't imagine internet conspiracies would motivating check, never know suppose. also hope monetary incentive all, considering US federal government done jack shit since April. vaccine end pandemic cure stupidity. Anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers shipped Antartica years virus control. never solve element stupid removed.  Good, fight back immoral unnecessary lockdowns. People need make living order feed families, especially restaurants bars...  Good point need listen CNN Town Hall last week doctor fauci said still going need mask orange vaccine actually lower body virus count. Yes - disclosing current CDC policy guidelines, send someone roof see way wind blowing. 

It’s unfortunate need trustworthy source - long time CDC regains trust. Every country looking rest doing, learning others’ failures success’. Tailoring work within country dogs going save world? Totally plot point get behind. care why? talk COVID's manager he's quite busy touring Alberta moment. dashboard includes worldwide cases. probably something Turkey reporting bunch cases yesterday. hard. comfortable either, though - sweating cloth mask quickly gets sweaty too. Ironically probably helps act better barrier since moisture blocks moisture fabric. Financially support businesses everyone shut precisely deplorable ones, ones die hill for.

Spoken like upper-middle class white person, probably living CBD rich city like Los Angeles San Francisco never worry underlings function. Oh definitely think that’s end goal sure. saying mostly back daily lives Fucking lifetime fitness still open near im appalled it.  understand. Unfortunately federal government paying us able stay home. one choose food/housing potential death loved one child. pandemics always last 2-3 years. agree ordering takeout. help wait staff people live. Sorry that, hospital doesn’t use antigen tests PCR tests superior much sensitive. would recommend getting second PCR, checked literature usually PCR tests used confirm antigen tests. Given results stress could cause you, second PCR could help ease mind. case seems like already know quarantine drink lots fluids. Serious question new normal people. Like understand SOLE reason we’re living like pandemic. 

So rationalize thinking you’re morally superior behavior hoping stretches long possible, killing thousands day ruining lives millions more? Doesn’t seem kinda sadistic? Don’t want save many people possible soon possible? 

If want people suffer say so.  people choose sympathise businesses basis state in? never see level consideration 'livelihoods' Iowa, Texas South Carolina. ""One well-known lateral thinkers demonstrated Leipzig intubated eight days later""

I wish doctors always felt free toss shade idiot patients. beautiful. County Board abdicated leadership pandemic. They're scared revolt even broach March-type shutdown curfews. They're literally going wait hospitals go triage ppl dying parking lots Gov Newsom steps shut down. seeing 150+ deaths day. sincerely hope news crews staking hospital lots show tsunami death &amp; dying that's coming. public realize Surge real. Unfortunately, it'll 3 weeks late. NY least they've explicitly stated goal herd immunity (I think defined 75% coverage) incorrigible people. lost cause. Natural selection take care.

I hope comment helps people unaware think masks alone make us safe. dad used believe Covid started. family aware. wash hands frequently refrain touching eyes. Stupid stupid Jackson, Miss., state’s top two health officials preparing roll sleeves coming days first get shots cameras roll, hoping send message, “We trust it.”



Shouldn't see White House personnel get shot?


Trump, Pence family line Oval Office. Let Faucci administer shots. line Senate, let McConnell, Rand Paul, others get it.


Surely spare dozen doses today means people willing get line next months. hope Biden get top Vaccine distribution USA don’t want it, scare me. docs nurses know seem ok it, we’re stones throw UCSF we’re used quinea pigs. I’m (non-covid, non-invasive) clinical trail now. get lots free treatment way go late stage trials later rounds, I’ve never done first round. TBH disappointed possibility immune, still shed virus carry virus, get sick it. reason keep masked distanced critical number people get vaccinated. I'd rather homeless eating food food bank risk kids life. own. silver lining! There’s evidence be, extremely low rate remember interview gave CBC stated 2nd wave fall wouldn’t bad proper precautions followed. thijk forgot sarcasm tag right given US constitution prosperity. right stay open.  Speaking restaurants, people mad closing indoor dining must money jobs able eat inside restaurant. So, order take out. always try explain people this. someone said understand saying sounds like coming place empathy, also detect bit virtue signaling. 

Nope. practice preach. supermarket 1 time Thanksgiving. (I host, people live home). Everything delivered home. I'm fortunate enough job allows avoid people.

Shipments happening right East Coast one part country. Also half time say we're getting major storm turns bust rolls sea. Yes know know fact that’s case parts country? said I’ve good experience never thought might best whole country. High population density, holiday season covid fatigue would guess. SARS offered long term immunity. Like years. can’t stand Fauci, could stepped aside, “don’t wear masks!” guy, let another one thousands government medical professionals articulate new “wear masks!” message.

Instead, public center things muddled messaging, it’s wonder half population got whiplash. I've exercising mask since gym reopened last summer. No, comfortable, encourages hurry work sets dawdle hours there. 

There excuse asking people inside building wear mask, unless dentist. always wondered way around. Maybe there's millions already infected never knew asymptomatic mild symptoms never got tested. worse second time around. may even know first time. outdoors bruh. catch 20 feet away you’d need inside direct line airflow infected face. Remember tested safe find alegies vaccine readily available general public, good luck getting public wear mask Small military budgets? Higher income taxes? Better enforcement existing taxes? Wealth tax? (admittedly last Argentina, perpetual economic crisis; also calling one UK cover Covid relief) Forget drive through; simply step outside, vaccination specialist drive black van inoculate anyone see! Well right course action furlough employees moment loans ran out, sell business money sink can't afford. sucks current plans developing business, that's excuse maintaining maskless gym viral hotspot ""COVID ain't real."" jumping ship soon enough going ensure go homeless. might even save much money needed start another business.

The government bother shit job creation numbers great past 9 months. Positive 278k jobs created, negative, would send absolute ripples negotiations. know repeat, don’t believe won’t believe deaths door nothing done you.

Your neighbor won’t care thing happens them. neighbor think “they must pre existing conditions” go life. It’s endless sad cycle. means see ya later covagator, there's room. also means medical staff perpetually exhausted since many patients deal with. Exactly this. fuckwit couldn’t even enforce bare minimum requiring masks prior this. People feel bad businesses required shutdown save sympathy actual responsible business owners, halfwits like follow orange pig “facts”. Shit, someone pay me? smell caterpillars, lady bugs, pill bugs, roaches, bed bugs, tortoise beetles, ants... 
My nose fucking wild. even find bird's nests woods solely scent. difficult grasp dumb people are.. vaccines literally way end restrictions. Fuck jackass Right? I'm well aware horrible things taking seriously. seeing friends, family celebrating holidays together, always wearing mask public etc. yeah I'm pretty mentally done point can't imagine living like winter. Especially Trump kind sort maybe admitted slight possibility he'd concede, probably. sister works here...great... disagree. businesses allowed open fact closed. think lot noncompliance there.

I think lot parties going people unaffected business closures, however. LA county 10 million people. population greater think something like 40 states lol. sure reason that's best guess, many people packed together. They've working months. first heard back September we're months trials training dogs. They’re One World Government even big government forced spend money fashion. Availability PPE folk?!?! amount resources water demanded used?  Life normal people get vaccinated it. already it. don’t know dude It’s like I’ve tested anywhere else. I’m questioning claim LA best testing nationwide 0 proof anecdotes. Well see virus is. Adding politics making things worse. Negativ interest rates. EU (als Germany) going help lot. Second, really matter. Never surfed before? Thanks riveting scientific analysis fox news small business owner, loans acceptable means dealing (even 0 interest). Real financial support form grants are.

No one forced take debt due government mandates shut businesses. reason matter (COVID valid reason btw public health safety, health safety due supercede family way business owners). 

Look way, give loan 100k pay back things rebound, I'm really terrible financial hole never get of. business takes loan 6 months still dealing mandates like too, they've done aggregate debt. problem uncertainty - weeks, businesses probably handle it. really know long need make funds stretch point, makes sense take debt can't see future. remind people sometimes demanding freedom without responsibility children do. Adults supposed understand minimum level responsibility maintaining society. new normal people.

Can please explain mean this? I'm annoyed people think working help fight covid. body never covid. know body react it. healthy, 30, work home even American citizen. get it, someone else hasn’t gotten yet it’s choose. Seriously, laws driving drunk protect citizens. Yet comes something can’t see don’t feel effects 2 weeks it’s “YOU CANT MAKE SHIT! PEOPLE SHEEP *COUGH COUGH*” like aren’t removing fucks society? mean know didn’t something crazy like ask police stop killing fellow citizens sun goes down, c’mon. USA 10 months prepare enough capacity... 10 months!

Shame! wonder relates severity disease. Almost everyone SARS hospitalized. school Name City it’s better? comes back dysfunctional government. can't shut things without supporting people. Trying get removed political Georgia fix this. Unemployed here, sitting home killing others. nations giving compensations, loans. American people ever learn: VOTE REPUBLICANS? people wearing masks people claim they're vaccinated they're whatever cheat system developed. everyone chance get vaccinated, public everyone needs assumed unvaccinated -- assholes assholes can't nice things. happened giant military rollout Trump promised? Online resources Cherokee (and Ojibwe, too!) awesome. Check [Dennis Sixkiller's radio iTunes, too. Damn, find weights.  like gold now. order requires 50% reduction Orange County jails, leaves discretion Sheriff, determine released transferred forms custody. indicates Sheriff consider whether medically vulnerable populations released, ultimately leaves figure - although require address medically vulnerable explain they've done protect them. Good. Selfish jerks. like gun owners buying guns Democrats get elected? People going getting other's faces think biden lock country gets in. Yeah I've trying order tip exceedingly well New Normal crowd anything say it. Hes like Hitler realize comments made ppl live flyover states themselves

Yeah absolutely, think sentiments unique state region, fact one saying ""fuck rural america"" someone even american... type comments pop state local subs too. People states almost exactly numbers blaming other, saying ""stay shithole state, shut border"". Literally neighbors shitting ""those hicks Shelbyville take seriously, us Springfield everything right"". think obvious people rural areas taking really seriously people cities packing bars hosting parties. state vs state, rural vs urban issue, affecting us. think majority ppl would agree failure bend curve California's fault, alone.

I understand saying anything state's fault. States homogeneous. Counties homogeneous. Cities homogeneous. Nothing California's fault. like 40 million people there. weird judge entire populations based generalizations. LOL  comparable federal nations like Germany federal government paying compensations - even individual states ordered close businesses. done federal level. like supporting ban drunk driving Ubers home free. Shutting public safety measure, it’s negotiable shouldn’t contingent financial support. 100% agree getting financial support Wow, I’m used responded reason. well. Take care president dump elected refuse help yet support dying end. sounds like cult me. Okay, make sense. Ugh. Thanks filling in! mistaken? force people remain homes? I'd like go back 2003. know vaccine developed SARS (according Dr Fauchi)? first highly transmissible deadly coronavirus know of. Quarantining mask usage meant virus died vaccine needed. 

SARS deadly, shorter incubation time, likely far fewer asymptomatic carriers made simpler contain Covid-19. Still, though, example public health measures effective eliminating disease widespread vaccine needed. Okay, thanks. smelling virus metabolites infection?  wealth disgusting. vaccine come fast? Dang. cousin mine works nursing home told today coworker showed bit symptoms CoV. didn’t let know after. 

So disheartening. ppl care longer, Mayor AWOL. Garcetti literally chair Biden's election inauguration committee. county leadership hamstrung they're council representing competing interests small businesses well community health. There's unified voice. 

Add Gov. Newsom's hands-off approach based Gospel saying One Body, Many Parts sh!tshow. there's conductor pull emergency brake going go rails. train wreck motion. I'm fortunate work 1:1 patient's homes. follow nursing groups SM stories heartbreaking. family members dying hospitals listening scared pleas patients ""please let die"" over. stories putting spouses hospital beds together hold hands one/the other/both pass. refrigerated morgue trucks. None HCW's signed expecting level death.

The one comment hit really ""All crying. Patients, nurses, doctors, family... there's always people crying. mean, gut wrenching sobs grief.""

I wish time don't. encouraged finish home gym


Now I’ve BJJ almost year depressing hell least standard work without feeling like I’m part problem middle line, there's still going people line behind chance yet. Well, sure shit now! actually something talked well. Like loan money, able come back, even loans, well, oh well. companies able bounce back. places won't. can't keep taking away people's livelihoods, thru fault help them. still acknowledge pharmaceutical companies would see huge potential profit grewtest health crisis last century?

I see literally president history would done least much, more?

I acknowledge every country actively working vaccine treatment?

The thing discredit vaccine making look like involved. government run competent individuals wouldn’t need worry literally dying virus dying can’t afford food. There’s really good choice :( understand frustration, need start arresting severely fining people. don’t see difference drunk driving someone violating cdc guidelines putting peoples lives risk selfish reasons. problem sheriffs like mine even liberal part California enforce mandates. You’re welcome think whatever like, I’m stating objective truth— you’ll see I’m right months time. Health authorities unambiguous role social distancing masking play next year even lack scientific literacy knowledge pandemic history supports assertion. 

This vaccine rollout emergency measure, real phase III trial. still lot unknowns virus vaccines. long immunity last? protective it? immunity prevent spread infection severity symptoms? What’s optimal booster schedule? need answer questions begin fantasize semblance normalcy answers, masks social distancing undoubtedly part lives.

It would fantastic wrong able quickly gather understand data unfortunately that’s process speed like vaccine development. It’s actually part cut process order get *something* might stem disaster 3k Americans die every day. 

And unfortunately we’ve done horrific job messaging scientific reality public one reason another (that’s it’s separate infuriating issue). We’ve anchored lot people’s expectations unrealistic date personally, I’m worried happen middle vaccine rollout people use dates they’ve given hard cutoff observing masking social distancing guidelines small proportion population kind protective immunity. vaccine tool, it’s magic bullet it’s even effective tool stopping spread disease. effective tool masking social distancing... look well that’s worked far. 

We need temper optimism caution else we’re setting up, emotionally psychologically, another nightmare chain nightmares. explain I’m coming from? minute 10 times much death cases covid death cases. day 120-130 000 death. world. covid dayly 12-13 000 death cases. want diminish - wear mask outside - know new sometimes painful scary. even half year diminish...we remind average daily number dead people. 10 times much covid. Daily. always like one ever cared. Anyway day twice much birth cases dyings. Come on. Look worldometers dot info ones get bailed government, like banks, airlines, auto makers...which category in? can't use mask since gets soggy sweat. said, probably got covid gym planning canceling membership cause expensive I'm returning anytime soon. That's good Native nation charge administering vaccines community you. living people at-risk Elders. They've already needed refrigerated storage places handle backup. pretty simple. numbers go way down, go back normal, don't, don't. misunderstood initial sentiment, sorry. see you’re saying. 

However, disagree focus pandemic takes away focus fields genetic diseases always around continue around. think it’s important consider COVID affects certain people pre-existing conditions severely, keeping scientists fields aid understanding COVID well. I’m medical field autoimmune disease want vaccine COVID, also want continue find cure better treatment/medication things well. Excluding moment. businesses told full capacity masks. shutdown hamstrung capacity allowing keep employees hours. need help business come back pandemic behind us. right people employ. sure. side effects quite unpleasant (high fever, pain around injection site) go away short time. release non-violent offenders, whose charges perhaps related drug use, writing bad checks, engaging sex work election season? I'll give professional opinion here, sniff 👀 shit show

I take flu vaccine, guess makes flu denier too.

I lucky got yellow fever vaccine -- hey, you? haven't, yellow fever denier.

Everyone wants protect themselves. risk groups vaccinated cannot blame anyone infections. Everyone else stupid—the Reddit creed news combined *National Board Health Welfare* saying time ask Finland Norway support taking patients makes failure swedish strategy evident point. I'm curious see anyone still thinks debatable. DHS: move world

covid: stop world

who won? decide! Yup, nearly every law agency CA promised never ever enforce COVID restrictions. 

(Because they're Conservatives personally agree them) Vaccine hesitant want top line, still wants line. want see big side effects works, commiting it. I’m sorry. deleted comment misread yours...

Hence take mask eat restaurant even though that's dumb hell, legal government wants businesses make money instead needing bailout.

I’ve heard anecdotal stories Russians vaccination bracelets trying argue way quarantine restrictions countries want vacation. amount people Canada said news they’re going visit dying grandparents soon get vaccinated frightening. hope offers form protection spread. hope get good aftercare information receive vaccination.

/Ahem. SOMEDAY Payments government around 1.5k per fortnight per adult Love it. Okay buddy unpack please? mean ‘everyone closes’? Go ahead, please! I’m waiting... need get test. Probably enforced whatsoever. Oh wait, that's authoritarian y'all Anti-vaccine term people believe vaccine. majority people getting vaccine gotten vaccines many things. don’t see must much experience people real life. happen know hospital's plan COVID past? holding vaccinating them? curious. Oh okay great that's simple easy governors taking pandemic seriously regions ICUs overwhelmed zero choice. 

The Governors reached President Congress pleas fell deaf ears. Unfortunately, struggling small businesses American families priority Republicans taking seriously since loss taste smell hallmark covid infection. upper class white Person uninformed Normal working class person thinks. Hope plan. everybody forget Thanksgiving? y'all go repressing memory hypocrisy come today? evidence whether mask requirements standing 6ft apart making difference, people's natural inclination reduce inter household contact friends family.

Sweden also seeing drop seasonal flu without mask requirement. sanitizing isn’t issue. issue people breathing heavily near people extended period time.  it’s easier countries Europe there’s many businesses compared US. 

Imagine millions business US compared country Europe...

you’re even comparing apples oranges. you’re literally comparing grapes apples.

put little thought instead saying ignorant things much controlling ingress applying mandatory quarantine. ended travel ban continued mandatory quarantine would looking twice many imported cases - still well monitoring capacity. 


I think complacency much strategies mainland targeting mitigation extermination. Extermination achievable goal creates something people happy protect. policy maintenance untenable people eventually get worn down. 


That is, Newfoundland's 'new normal' 'normal' mostly keep intraprovincial restrictions want protect normalcy. mainland's 'new normal' accept part society vaccines come. People really caring keep restrictions restrictions still circulating. feels like neverending torrent mainland us feels like something like checking stove go store. 


One mentally healthy, mentally draining. Note moved back Newfoundland Quebec summer. felt hopeless pointless Quebec saw ambulances running cases exploding really expectation end. NL? feels good. Putting mask feel like piece cloth poor necessary defense neverending threat - little precaution virus came truly makes difference whether traceable not. 



Its like elections know? someone say 'cut healthcare' would throw em roof, works. something made. Something benefits us. Something willing defend. 


To us, extirpating COVID like that. Something made happy fight defend. peer reviewed yet, go: 🤦‍♀️ Based reaction hold funny. Please delete jokes never attempt again. appeal ban knock knock joke 6-8 months. ""We know"" exactly ""Facts"". Nobody knows long term complications either Covid Vaccine. Agreed. think end 2021 worst case scenario. don’t like hopes dashed. Loss taste smell without caused congestion relatively specific covid, false negatives pretty common. I'd follow isolation guidelines first positive test. Nice.  said ""shithole"" country. one comes mind. I'll give hint - Canada. yes pandemic insurance

Yeah, that: owners cinema grill chain purchased pandemic insurance. Despite paying lot money it, world's oldest largest specialty insurance company, Lloyd's London, trying weasel making payments. sell pandemic insurance ever planning pay it? Yea, people ignoring Korean CDC trying say US CDC saying reinfections rare. Two major studies come (Korea UAE) showing reinfections rare uncommon people test positive least 12 weeks (which retesting infectiousness discouraged). Yes, businesses helped, government done nothing feed relief money big business trump-owned businesses. It’s evil.

However, something like 3000 people day dying US, virus spreading uncontrollably people won’t take responsibility actions. Yes, it’s bad small businesses fucked, it’s fault every single person voted trump. Businesses need comply stay home orders, also, f*ck people even showing there? Maybe make little equitable, fine people go there, too, they’re contributing problem.

But given zero enforcement stay home order, probably won’t ever pay fine.  grew up, spent life, smack middle Boston-NYC megalopolis. Nine years culture shock still strong. would probably kill actual NY pizza. feel bad people causing mass death? Would love see results year now.  Imagine time traveller came back...  Greg Gibson motioning companies. Yet people complaining ""shutdown"" consumers, workers. Shut down. “Et tu, Brute?” - every day mention, happen eat inside, fairly likely restaurant simply disobeying orders. live orange county saw restaurant indoor dining 2 weeks ago so, thought indoor dining allowed. Guessing going orders well. could wrong, done anything pickup food cook home since March. Oh no... anyway That’s 2022 stuff. happening time soon. could done harsh lockdowns one real got with. instead deal every special snowflake special feelings. least New York aren’t even likely option get fir long time. nice/s   don't. testing influenza positives less 1% saw last year. Like keep wearing mask social distancing hope. Things sounding safer make so. Subscribe r/science serious reading Mrna vaccines long they've working them.

Also, get vaccinated soon allowed please. thoughts exactly. pay people sit asses home well being. I’m fine paying higher city/county/federal taxes ensure fellow Americans sit asses home worried finances get thing control. said “their testing people” point..... similar smell hung people have. dad alcoholic always nasty fart smell day after. like muted. guess kinda smell like fart strong. muted nauseating.
I think liver breaking toxins God uninformed :) go right ahead

Still waiting  know difference? 

9/11 fell governments lap took advantage it. became issue Americans politicians media behind it. Americans stood together, unlike covid. Covid 2 political parties pulling completely opposite directions. War great wealthy, especially soil.

President gambled would get bad got rekt, party full support. really good news future. pandemic people take sick seriously wear mask/stay home flu symptoms continue better flu seasons future. Look, people already said it, seriously screwing many many people. far evictions, pause evictions ending Many people expected pay back rent Months Rent Evicted: friend uninformed ask normal people trying make living thing harsh lockdowns forced go threw :) every sort workout allows masks worn comfortably.  keep hearing need 70% reach herd immunity via vaccination. 

However, US high infection rate. probably tens millions already may inherent antibodies. account towards that? Maybe need reach lower threshold? Definitely exception though. norm long shot. Couple things. First please provide source says won’t enough risk groups summer. Second obesity linear risk factor compelling one watch case. Think like this: you’re 30 years old 60 pounds overweight risk death increases say 2x. you’re 0.04% risk death. you’re 75 obese risk death increases 270x 30 year old you’re ~5.4% chance death. 

[And don’t think I’m pulling ass, here’s CDCs IFR estimates show 270x increase IFR 70 year old vs 30 year old. lot people obviously traveled around repress act like short term memory. halloween 4th july, etc. We’re experiencing financial downturn right now. live area shut again. time without federal financial relief. Covid public health crisis poverty. government needs help people financially they’re going continue close. totally unsustainable. say you’ve lived car.... imagine children hungry.... Real facts. US it’s control. countries quarantined locked wore masks it’s control. spin want, 300,000 dead bodies disagree. thinking it’s pretty unfortunate act sub. First all, died regardless whether shared beliefs, it’s tragedy. can’t call people selfish murderers wanting see family, also applaud belittle guys death.

Also, seem blended line ‘being opposed lockdowns’ (because truly malignant are) believing virus fake. Many many people completely willing acknowledge dangers virus importance utilizing smart, tactical mitigation. said, government’s knee jerk reactions inconsistent messaging can’t overlooked, it’s responsibility sound-minded citizens skeptical government overreach regardless reasoning.

I’m starting think there’s sense even trying reason sub, fear completely lost way. scare Jamaican taxi drivers speaking Patois them.  Aw man, well early too.

Now restrictions barely enforced Huh yeah ok.  /r/Unexpected/ heard good answer worried LONG TERM affects vaccine.

HERE IS: long-term side effects rare cases less damaging covid infection. 

If weigh damage society whole unvaccinated person damage suffer rare case negative long-term side effect even come close. Vaccinating way go.

So question simple, make selfish choice risk worst respiratory infection ever comes risk (some studies indicate 50/50 higher) long-term neurological respiratory symptoms (perhaos chronic) selfless thing risk (minuscule) unknown long-term side-effects vaccine?

The answer pretty clear cut I'm sitting. think root deaths people wearing masks, solely people congregating. keep lots businesses open legitimate economic activity US people wear masks. sweet cash pockets guess gym mop mats session (even pre-covid) wipe weights lifting session. go everyday.  dumb think. correct fines name, new LLC. mean, keep going him, keep stuff juggling act decades. might able go bank accounts, associated new company, especially sufficiently obscure paper trail. 

I used work guy would stuff. thought sure would destroyed now, 30 years later he's still driving around $75,000 truck (for business) living multi-million dollar home. like judgements meaningless. understand it. addition virus easily transmitted, COVID often transmitted pre asymptomatic people. Flu transmitted primarily people symptomatic. 

People staying fuck away anyone sick right now. Government things socialism. used blame actually victim foodborne illness.. I've matched bf taco Taco watched *him fly bathroom totally fine lol like 4 5 months cases surprisingly low

Are testing rigorously? yet see cop town wearing mask. problem US state government largely bear burden imposing shutdowns, federal government really provide needed financial support. Republican Senate president stubbornly refusing so. 

So state governors left really shitty decision make whether shut things extent, knowing can’t provide financial support also knowing one else make calls needed keep constituents safe politically correct criticize though. Oh well. seriously going write 280k deaths acceptable? job include spreading virus? bubs auto immune makes huge risk getting getting really sick nah bro I’m going Walmart :) feel bad people. read UN world health said lockdowns gonna cause harm good. cuz know people don’t like look real facts :) covid. countries took seriously got control gone back normal. failed take seriously killed elderly anyone else world. Public health measures aren’t issue here. lack financial aid is. Protest right thing. I’m going support foregoing safety measures preventing hundreds thousands deaths.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  pessimistic projection puts 5,000 January, probably no. One word: Thanksgiving. 

Restrictions going fantastic Thanksgiving: gone 140 deaths day (all stats post 7-day moving average) early August 40 deaths day two straight weeks November (a state 40 million population!). insisted. INSISTED Thanksgiving we're way record 150 deaths day. Here's summary:

* 3 months go 140 40 deaths day
* 3 weeks go 40 150 deaths day.

We live without Thanksgiving we're paying price. V-Day works. far know, cancer communicable disease. imagine fine business, pesonally, actually. might work.

But bankruptcies count credit score, obviously. least residential renting, credit score deny leases. happens commercial leases, able find landlord would rent new business name. Czechia? highest number cases per million (excluding micro-states). due robust post-socialist healthcare number victims relatively low. much pay kudos to. Wow, really highlights terrible situation country (Lithuania). Japan bit 3000 new cases population 126 million people. Lithuania 2.8 million people... we're bit 3000 new daily cases now. never going make headlines we're tiny... helped businesses closing businesses? Cases certainly going splurge first dose people saying “oh instantly immune vaccine” still need second dose wait actually effect. Man, fuck people. welding people homes me. Massachusetts, except maybe don’t even go far rural areas. late spring/early summer noticed mask social distancing compliance dropped sharply one traveled west inner Boston suburbs outer ones. Covid numbers good. risk people aren’t people going spreading virus. pandemic live give long term effects healthy people asymptomatic cases brain heart lungs.

In addition, people going false sense normalcy got vaccinated don’t know whether vaccinated people still spread virus. People going wear masks say oh got vaccine! Even didn’t could still spread it. number people trial irrelevent. time thats important. Thats find shit like protein chain used bind vaccine recepters infiltrates bone marrow gives everyone leukemia 8 months. 

There zero data studies say certain year dick wont fall right kidneys wont fail. know everyone trial develop Oligodendroglioma another 6 months. Walmart gyms (LA fitness) street closes whenever shutdowns happen. guys much worse financial situation LA fitness average american able get it? plan travel country 2021 would prefer get vaccine soon possible. 60% small businesses closed due covid permanently closed it’s yet Relax, likelihood get infected exposure. gym 12 years old forced business bankruptcy. took online, virtual PT sessions, coaching seminars nutrition counseling online got Jack shit help government close. I'd guess low. going really hard convince people prisoner deserves vaccine pretty much anyone. 

The politician says ""this convicted rapist/drug dealer/pedophile/robber/arsonist deserves saved hard working Walmart employee"" basically signing job whoever runs next election. honestly no-brainer. said podcast bit nuanced. summer arguing take virus seriously guarantee vaccine would developed, one developed would effective, effective would get soon enough prevent mass casualty. Basically, saying hope vaccine developed ""hope plan"" needed take action prevent virus spreading. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

&amp;#x200B;

It's half government wants funnel financial support large corporations instead local businesses everyone else meant drink golden trickle. Melbourne, height lockdown told symptoms likely COVID flu. he’s running LLC, renting space, leasing equipment literally untouchable. might able bring criminal charges somehow going business losing battle cases (and entire family) scheduled dental cleaning late March 2020. cancelled. rescheduled September 2021 - 18 months later.

I sure lot people putting dental cleanings, eye exams, blood pressure screenings - like us. good. bad dying COVID-19 good. Sure stupidly high incomes top many companies business owners Jeff Bezos. expect person owns small business keep business year without revenues. business plan years year without revenue whole different story. Holy Shit, that's like 250,000 deaths. Europe cases high, new stay-at-home orders work well there's lockdown fatigue 

oh yes lockdown fatigue Europe  I'm rhode island. Everyone seems wear masks seemingly board ""Covid bad"" train, least providence. still one highest levels country. We're fucked number places, states localities decrying loss tax revenue trying make novel revenue generation.

Like, shut economy, that's what's going happen. thing though. ones disagreeing butt head Reps.

There collective stupidity people general. wear mask faithfully everyday. walk stores see nothing people walks life wearing masks noses wearing one all. makes think doomed. white republican righty nut jobs causing higher cases. inner cities worse due general ignorance plain caring. 

This probably wothless due fact probably internet reeee bot one track mind. muzzling sidelining CDC one frustrating things.

Once Biden unmuzzles it, there's going lot harsh reality coming it. might contribute false narrative pandemic issue Biden. Also give essential workers hazard pay. True imagine shutting business worked hard building. virus 99.7% survival rate. Fuck crazies encourage horseshit. Lol oh no....? Sad. country music fan always liked Charley Pride pretty sure republican plan, motivate defiance knowingly providing enough support get safety measures money scarce resource. would call VD-Day?. Awesome. Covid, two types contactees; Deserved deserved. “No, rona isn’t hoax, social distancing works“

To people genuinely want shit think first curve flattening meant hoax wtf Huh? wrote friend decided derail discussion, simple impressions, seem mirror impressions many others thread, based many interactions Swedes subreddit. vast majority wrote descriptions observed behavior, psychological interpretation, easily falsifiable.

As second paragraph - sure read. recall attacking anyone's intellect last Spring, believe extreme minority cases.

As people taking seriously ""petulant child"" -- think need break Reddit friend. clearly taking well. Also someone mentioned asymptomatic. source this? several family members utterly convinced vaccine causes infertility would helpful information help dissuade fears. article linked looks like debate lawyers trying interpet what's possible what's not. 

I'm lawyer certainly look clear-cut implying. Guard would smart start. prisoners. Hell every new guy get get shot coming in. people behind bars monsters.  government telling cannot operate free market lol. basically opposite. yeah 60% pay check rest us favor kill off. true. However, currently $20,000 grant state, $10,000 grant county specifically targeted businesses ordered close. specifically named gyms encouraging businesses apply these. although it’s guaranteed payment, it’s like aren’t options Anyone already wear masks want to. start that? honestly expected virus death count MO worse currently time little surprised gotten slammed states. However currently ICU beds available within 4-state region full, least information told days ago. Covid goes away pretty quickly aren’t old already deaths doorstep. (I covid) Mr. Monday sounds much like Mr. Asshole.  We’ve people get ill far,the media love blow things up.  people supported Trump GOP nothing ever since supporting reopening things way early.

And they're making money GoFundMes Fox News appearances ever business.

I feel bad people suffering 6 + months, without anyone anything. get financial support major contributor GOP senators president. Oz reaping benefits.  I’m sure people got financially torched. Give bosses number rip new one. name countries expect require covid vaccine? Looool dude im OP whining chill jets.... 

Also way downplay million dead people ""just math"". wonder fast story would change someone cared about. Mother? Father? Sibling? Grandparent? Nutters aside it’s enough make never get it, even temporary would lie it? entire mall area Long Beach. Absolutely. 100% support country needs come grinding halt everything except base necessities keep people alive well, like utilities, internet, groceries, healthcare, etc. non-essential businesses can’t work home, need closed. needs happen large portion population received vaccine confirmed antibody levels holding. needs strict enforcement. 

I also recognize none possible unless 1. hope starve people/ ruin lives financially 2. federal government provides stimulus. bs republicans keep trying pass throws money large corporations protects businesses lawsuits employees absolutely refuse take precautions all. Well they’re stupid countries then. No, don’t Washington DC protest legal system allows much are.  words weren’t saying guns fault. nation didn’t basic levels adherence, reaping sown. Lets also mourn 4000 people died non COVID related causes Well according social media, they’re great. gym Irvine, CA client base loyal. Prepandemic lot 40+ member outings like awful fire runs obstacle courses. possible thriving like are. adapt. exposed someone exposed someone ended testing postive, get it? person exposed tested negative day exposure. 

My exposure probably 2 minutes inside semi close person Density matters parts LA pretty dense. New York City also dense, got hit really hard 1st wave. helped build immunity, also made people take things seriously. 

I think people LA started get lazy result. Quit job. That's basically asking do. Sounds like free-dumb Covid election. sending patients countries fun ? Sweden’s fault though? fault US conservatives don’t understanding legal system lol. Sweden...help us. Cool, let’s open kill exponentially people way small sample size far vaccine trials go. think 6 months start wholesale vaccinations 44,000 person phase 3 trial day one way comparable typical phase 3 took year much slower ramp due difficulties locating acceptable candidates? Whatever. never said implied 100% comparable every technical detail, got ton data getting roughly comparable ballpark, reasonable person would understood indicating. Also, emergency approval still approval, obvious since vaccinating people two days. tone nuts sign conversation.  God, stupid. Incivility isn’t allowed sub comment get removed. 

Learn debate without attacking people. fight mandate court willfully ignored? pandemic? 

Hell fined continue fined work within mandate  country? doubt, 100%. Please mistake expert Best place steaks spuds 😋 that's official positive tests. actual number people end winter? without vaccine, many countries gonna massive immune population vaccine available most. Holy fuck haha, pronounce DOA... burn clearly fatal I’m curious, asking business close employment/healthcare terminated? so, plan support family, children, ensure safety providing shelter, food, access healthcare?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s simply true

You taking account sheer number times get car drive highway

If every 2-3 people 100 went highway died constant, bet ass people wouldn’t go highway. buy absolutely relate. Gym form meditation. Think little harder. happens leave mask less gym spreading covid? Hint: spread people go gym. skeptical, ignorant.

Defend view data, opinions. 

Do know many people gotten side effects either Pfizer/Moderna vaccine?

If know this, make convincing argument use it, respect stance. However, views based ignorance fear. People group 3 nearly bad AntiVaxxers. Watch he's gonna pull ""Run another country issues America instead staying changing it"" defense, that's reasonable existed profession people try find ACTUALLY going rather guessing.

Then motherfuckers LISTENED people... German secretary health said interview: Wir werden ein paar Monaten einander wahrscheinlich viel verzeihen müssen.

What means: probably forgive lot months. Lol no, plenty mites deal with. weevil vegetables. changed tune shutdowns. can’t keep shutting businesses ALSO help millions unemployed.

I still support shutdowns always reopen business, get new job fix economy, can't bring someone back dead. two terrible choices, one irrevocable, simply difficult fix. Reminds guy contracted coronavirus 7 different times Republicans prance without mask, 2020 suspect lot less flu crossing border travel restrictions. time counter-attack dangerously getting close stage. Dogs hypersensitive olfactory system highly sophisticated processing system identify specific substances. Surely spike protein must specific scent isolated trained hound. I’ve rejoicing since March haven’t caught sniffle. haven’t weird feeling of, “uh oh. bad going get.” I’ve absolute perfect health!! It’s glorious! Well many people shutdowns also giving people/businesses money view “handouts” “evil socialism”. dies, deserve person happened agree asinine lockdowns.

wow. joking? ive already done math. retarded. Positive rate important tests per population. may peddling misinformation, speaking ignorance. immunologist, ask google mRNA half-life. others mentioned, mRNA unstable, completely gone body hours/days.

If got side effects first days, weeks... going get any....

We thousands volunteers took vaccine phase 1 (more 6 months ago) side effects. whatever happened russian vaccine putin claimed months ago  help you, understand much dude makes per minute. actually think afford it, help logistics obvious caveats. i'll never understand capitalists realizing late stage capitalism inevitable time allow people become trillionaires opinion regulation mean shit. People die poor care. That’s whole point. You’re missing it. regulatory capture made information release completely untrustworthy?

This.

They said kids can't spread schools safe... retracting statements said opposite political pressure.

The CDC longer trustworthy. sure kind attention brings lots new supporters cause. /Sarcasm Could possibly eradicate influenza strains little numbers host world year? Okay, choose believe everything’s closed shut since March. (former) gym also trying stay open. WA Safe Start plan three categories moment: Allowed, Restricted, Allowed. Indoor gyms fitness centers clearly stated allowed, ""professional training"" restricted. ""professional training"" term obviously applies job training, gym using interpreting professional fitness training. Needless say going back even safe. Let open stop madness Freedom speech, probably. encouraged local officials impose measures stricter state’s, creating patchwork health regulations based locality.


So hypocritically ignores White House Coronavirus Taskforce advice, telling local levels state more. Yea Americans dumbest people world Like make sure hundreds thousands pages data Pfizer submitted accurate.  reason

Yes reason. first place, told wear mask, Covid thing, insulting belittling. second--and realized today shopping--wearing mask puts things certain context. walk grocery store mask, goal get what's list get quickly efficiently possible. idea might walk around enjoy shopping pleasure vitiated mask, social distancing signs, arrows floor. Third, greater context, post-pandemic mask mandates based moral requirement collective utilitarianism; is, duty us take efficient action benefit, particularly saving lives. Well, accept that. healthy duty sick act primarily illness prevention. right enjoy health, duty preventing illness falls susceptible. 

If want wear masks post-Covid, stop also talk acknowledge you. want wear mask post-Covid, major problem.  mean censor? People live self centered wear mask right need someone common sense make decisions since can't seem handle themselves. really specific saying ""everyone closes"" since causes lot problems businesses, specified like ""closes public gathering"" like preventing dine-in restaurants. shut can’t leave people assistance.

Just one week salary every wage earner going entire government budget. Agreed 100%. That's maddening seeing anyone argue lockdown. December state implementing mild lockdown rules one willing go full lockdown follow guidelines back April.  Sorry (yah, I'm Canadian), deny die karma action.

If ""anti-lockdowner"", wishing death. funny much everyone panicking back sprint, government went out, closed borders that, that's contained successfully. everyone fell asleep laurels. cases spring drop ocean compared they've past three months, yet government still issue proper quarantine. Shops still close, stalling online secondary education long could too. couple days ago finally put limit number people different households meet up. 

This sad. feel like every single country Europe (and states provinces North America) made mistakes. Sigh.  journal, that's bit much think? /s fun games smell someone's egg onion shart. Damn that's short. wonder angry They're brave. thought meant scarce perspective business owner

I misunderstood Time lock one too? vagaries lead believe marijuana spider mites. Cheesoid: Petril! unseen. expect 3 per million case vaccination. people allergic everything sun. healthcare workers high risk, adamant wanted it. many vaccines cannot take pregnant dangerous. Since vaccine new, enough data suggest safe. Germans sugarcoat facts - even throwing shade, plain old truth. love them. australia, nz asia starters, still fence west end front need food need git swole. People die without food faster die covid. People die swole. risks opening Walmart outweighs risks Rona. risks swole not, gyms remain closed. Please inject microchip me, can't manage anymore Tell thank appreciated. think would able handle that. watch news see it, think hit nurse crying. see family long work many shifts. also mentioned made worse patients dying conscious knew going anything. slap reality. know why, never occurred could conscious. one dog died pre-existing conditions (like surgery recently something) recalling correctly. trillion dollar bailout airlines corporations. trump's son-in-law got paid. throw money whoever want. keep epi-pen hand like plan do. Alabama closed 3 months ever since they've opened, I've less motivated. got new job schedule little different go like used to. used 3 1 off, 5/6 days week. go 3 days week. Yeah, like leaving house Germany they're big moment.  Combined fact flu vaccines. Undoubtedly way people got flu jab year last. F.D.A.’s decision followed extraordinary sequence events Friday morning White House chief staff, Mark Meadows, told F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, consider looking next job didn’t get emergency approval done Friday, according senior administration official spoke condition anonymity authorized discuss matter. Dr. Hahn ordered vaccine regulators agency end day.

What chief staff threatening FDA commissioner? chief staff physician, scientist, FDA, yet he's giving ultimatums threatening FDA making scientific decisions supports. abuse power administration. FDA would done anyway; White House wants take credit it. people become desensitized things like they're frequent. January 20 can't come soon enough. Plus Germany consistently showed one best Europe managing covid.

As German see all. Germany basically lucky first wave March lagging behind European countries month, comparatively soft lockdown killed wave early helped Germany summer low numbers.

But German politicians learned nothing it. numbers started rise Sempemter state governments (who charge restrictions) dragged feet even though Merkel warned early something needed done. November got far soft lockdown never managed lower numbers, hard lockdown needed almost two lost months. They're type learn mistakes ignoring lessons people's mistakes. don’t even know enough realise housing blocks ONE city one state. wasn’t whole Australia. it’s funny city look far horrified. Look backyard, we’re fine thanks dont get it, business owners people think alike always trying reopen keep fight able reopen. arent fighting gov subsidize remain closed? Thats effort be, know state/fed gov damn well afford wont helps people! think they’re letting bleed political reasons

So point Biden economic failure

I much higher opinion country (us) covid even prior covid lofty opinions rest brown people speak of, come us, causing migrant crisis. please, help help us process. Still healthcare workers? I’m don’t believe conspiracy either. 
But seriously sweden could done lot lot more. Maybe fixed completely results could much better. 
Tegnell co made huge mistakes proud admit change course. rest Sweden seems frozen numb all. They’ve misled long don’t know way down. figure pass eventually. horrible cost. 
It’s pretty much America. It’s really late much population also misled long. Biden able change things bit bit much baked in. Let guess...South Dakota? lol- wouldn’t damn thing. read comment mouth agape oblivious narcissistic was. 

There indeed many ignorant stupid people country (as many countries) you’re really talking people different values you. 

I imagine disdain people across aisle whole host policy issues (taxes, healthcare, energy) must comforting think differences intelligence instead life choices. 

I happen agree particular issue (the pandemic) find attitude towards choose live lives differently take risks wouldn’t condescending, ignorant, unhelpful. Haha yea thanks, didn’t expect response lol  help truck driver eat hes road middle nowhere? sure intent here, comment like ""all lives matter"" COVID One given long keep making excuses. Yeah that's kinda me. Fatigue really set in. pretty scared getting I'm like whatever. I'm healthy 26 year old I'm going die doubt I'll even know it. want give people, get it, whatever. people would've done supposed to, we'd nowhere near now. limit half country isn't? pretty annoying. Decades Republican-backed decimation governmental financial crime investigative services. fact IRS budget half 20 years ago coincidence. concerted effort wealthy (and right, wealthy not) eliminate enforcement financial crimes. pharmacies following government process. first nursing homes. going vaccinate essential workers still unknown US Grim reaper disguise. Lol, sure. intubation form lockdown? Surely, refused treatment maintain freedom. mean, certainly winning awards, sarcasm form comedy. Humor eye beholder, really.... also like testing centers. need distancing PPE cleaning doses. Agreed. Maybe she’s talking global wise. tragic. wanted bring moments joy frail forgotten seniors. probably killed them. hate fucking virus.  used think way. trump came along scared paying close attention. republicans 100% making rich even rich. That’s it. Everything else means end ways track people voting them. 

The democrats aren’t perfect. they’re structurally much better org republicans. shitty corrupt large group bad eggs. 1:1 replacement I'm going pretend is, folks access weights check r/bodyweightfitness. decent enough recommended routine get really good strength calisthenics. Again, things replacement (e.g., deadlifts lower back movements fairly limited general), enough money anything beyond homemade pullup bar gymnastic rings, managed hold onto build strength well enough.

I currently full home gym different financial situation now, lot want get creative. like getting new copy Super Smash Bros hearing 'NEW RECORD' non-stop every time finish fight. COVID real Democrats, would rest us?

They gather crowds, large celebrations, go indoor restaurants gyms, travel. we? mean, old rich white guys power evil, obvious bad apples popped demographic. XD would provided financial support businesses instead pumping money mega corps politician owned businesses wouldn’t issue. want people stay home work, pay up!

Both parties shit. They’re guilty bullshit. One blood hands. got new debit card ignored calls emails. can’t pull money dead debit card.  argument lockdowns work without stimulus rational, lot bad conclusions get drawn it. people use argument finish saying answer open everything up, tearing government effective plan make things safer. guy voted Trump anyway kept arguing reopen everything he's still wrong track. PEOPLE HIDE IT! 

That's disease best current course action stay home!

I understand everyone lack adequete financial support government making impractical. countries hide paid people hide significantly better health perspective economic one.

If think people hiding virus bad thing understand works. Oh, live world without clickbait headlines. Mostly clickbait, I'll give little credit appropriate use quotes around word approve.

**tl;dr** ""Approve"" narrow specific definition related FDA review drugs, vaccine ""authorized emergency use"" rather ""approved"". anticipated coronavirus continue circulate human population, drug companies continue Phase 3 clinical trials toward goal getting regular, non-emergency, FDA approval. things going compliance social distancing, mask usage, good hygiene area closed gyms? Yeah, meeting ""approve"" it, grant EUA not. -10,000 media crackpot. that's socialism! /s actually allow portion go non- payroll expenses, iirc 40% could used way. Oh cool, deaths drop ton next month two vaccinate vulnerable populations good that, yeah? Something capacity thousands people pass through. vaccine needs used within hours defrosting, efficient buy special fridges needed keep one place, bring thousands vaccine recipients place. 

Instead trying take vaccine people, they're bringing people vaccine. Therefore capacity, equipment. -Hey, for...

-Move along sir. government prevented happening. Every person fighting themselves, totally abandoned elected officials. I'm pharmacist generally consider reasonable person trusts science experts, even skeptical vaccine rushed. lot skepticism came perception Trump forcing things approval processes without due course. However, read informative article researching basically explained - normal timelines much longer need secure funding, write grants, find enough people, gather enough data, etc. takes forever. COVID solved problems immense resources available, tons willing participants, virus running rampant.

&amp;#x200B;

I think healthcare professionals heard explanation would change tune 100% support vaccine. not, likely fringe people anti-vax anyway trust medical opinions. went motions graduate get license, never actually learned anything. Nobody getting evicted, there’s federal order putting halt evictions covid 19 ever actually lived car? Sheriff saying he'll release violent offenders. judge *obviously* ordering release violent offenders. know transportation packages Pfizer's vaccines tracked 24/7 due presentations earlier year guy can’t spell “Forrest Gump” certainly one intelligent individuals really need go look one many dashboards tracking positive cases deaths.

If did, would know comment fucking stupid relative ever. country reflection people. X doubt all. I’m saying, you’re pointing it’s choice lives money. shut without aid people lose businesses. don’t shut less people lose businesses people die.

You chose money. Even 8 nurses would terrible ratio ICU setting... Unless *also* lot support staff (RT, PSW, PT/OT, RD, pharmacy, etc) help. NA normal 1:1 1:2 ICU nursing patient ratios.

Of course understand 8:30 better 4:30... that's really low bar :( trust government, trust Donald Trump. There's reaching people like that. should. defense got economics degree Trump University. KN95s sold singles, $10 each. news government, trust it. First, physical beds really expand capacity.

Fact-check: false. Physical beds *do* really expand capacity. 

-There doctors available simply ICU doctors. ideal use doctors, done.

-ICU floorplans - hell, *all* floorplans - designed non-pandemic scenarios. laid plenty space designed comfortable workload. need stretch, adding beds would could lived care sent home die facilities available lost coin flip admitted.

This could happen, necessarily ICU full. like *entire hospital closed*.

All speaks necessity hurrying mean friends black? can’t read article I’m guessing it’s emergency use authorization no, say. maybe assume half tested postive 5 months, half 5 months. estimate, obviously wrong many reasons, good enough internet discussion care home fault, allowed make come ask permission to. like it’s percussion instrument much string instrument big corporations get bail outs. Merica, fuck yeah. wondering allergy thing. screenings allergies reliable case someone aware particular allergy would coexist well vaccine? would imagine multiple vaccines coming, someone can't get one, maybe would still able get one others. Let keep shitting Oklahoma. everyone thinks ass, keeps people coming here. like low traffic affordable cost living is. currently much likely dog die dying feeding one reservoir dogs? got pandemic insurance they'd driven business competitors didn't.

So model fundamentally broken. research shows Vitamin might help, pretty slow uptake. Get bit sunlight possible. Best luck father. probably still get test, difference possible case confirmed case might matter point. pretty much makes think table people immune issues. I've heard lot people insist be, I'm skeptical, I'm even allowed get flu shot. you, person functioning person severe reaction, assume vaccine would either a) ineffective (which measles MMR vaccine -- ask one ineffective two effective, idea, either) b) cause severe reaction body struggles cope with.

I'm disqualified vaccine 65 different ways (previous vaccine allergic reaction (tetanus), methylprednisolone use, etc), anyway, huge loss hear severe side effects, sort lend worse fears regarding it. cases nearly high spring, back March- may 7,000 test day. 30k tests day possible re-work HVAC system filtration eliminates virus? Maybe yet. hope stay safe. People like father amazing. Ironic Don’t deaths per day 9/11 every day even without pandemic.  Yeah, kind response nothing help. much stuff worth another humans life?

How many people protesting lack financial aid instead shutdowns designed save lives?

Why care selfish people would rather see fellow citizens die eat rice beans? one evicted

I’m 100% financial aid, lack doesn’t give right act way kill hundreds thousands people SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, infringe god-given rights pay entire savings medicine. want none socialism here. enjoy living country give trillions billion dollar cooperations made bad investments small business owners get practically nothing. 

/s People driving Mississippi better damn careful. would hate involved bad car accident severe trauma nowhere state get proper treatment. isn’t Covid patients dying home, it’s patients need beds too. hell learn play bass? know others well, included. think people getting flu vaccines year, people aware respiratory health right now. company going force employees take vaccine liable complications side effects.  People getting evicted. You’re personally seeing absolutely happening. People protesting financial relief don’t get publicity like idiots. 

Shutdowns without relief worse longterm public health. makes covid worse people lose housing you’re adding parts poverty lead death illness. think hospitals don’t infrastructure deal covid, wait till see infrastructure homeless shelters tens millions people. literally ate $10 three days I’m better lot people least still job. People can’t live like indefinitely. Idk you’ve ever third world country, don’t think you’re prepared actually live one. I'd also say normal season people mild symptoms bug would still go business maybe treat like badge honour shopping visit people bored planned already. Whereas everyone's super cautious feel weather take chances take precautions spread bug chance may Covid. virus similar SARS CoV-1, people contracted still immunity decade. far stretch assume immunity virus would also long lasting, right, 100% sure yet. I'm hopeful, though. ""Scientists revise COVID-19 incubation period 7.7 days"" (median 7.7 days, half show symptoms before, half after.) old incubation period 14 days upper limit also revised up. 14 days, 90% people would shown symptoms. 20 days, 99% people would shown symptoms, 

I think study US data, earlier studies over-represented sicker patients enough swabs confirm milder cases, turns milder cases longer incubation periods. brighter side, also less contagious average severe cases. go gym wear mask Probably there's bunch people dying covid I'm still going get drive thru food, go outside runs, stuff like that. completely avoiding people.

And yeah might email organizer ask do. I'm unemployed due pandemic &amp; still support shutdowns, even though means struggle little more.

I wish getting support government though. I'm state hates give unemployment benefits, never even got that. earnings year Jan &amp; Feb, single consulting gig paycheck, &amp; single stimulus check. earned age 13. check state's website. MA, would phase 2.  80 year olds dont frequent bars, restaurants parties. weird little pissy pants tantrum makes zero sense. Thank you. easy assume ""we anticipate"" means ""we anticipate cases"" scream. 115 / 18285 = .006

Meaning every 1,000 people contracted virus Michigan facilities once, six people tested positive 90 days later.

Takeaways...

Reinfection happens, uncommon.

These facilities incapable protecting people held :/ realize category high priority get vaccine, right? freaking reason. brother law prison counselor. support shutdowns, without financial support... **and financial support ain't coming**

What want fact? Ignore reality wistfully wish things better don’t know man, gaslighting serious form abuse don’t think applies here. high blood pressure overweight made ok someone die many years even decades normally would. Dismissing deaths cause concern “preexisting conditions” breathtakingly shortsighted. Taking metro rush hour must hell nose though. 2016:  felt sick 2 weeks year ago really hit news. thought staph infection cystic acne, treatment help. Slight cough there, happens sometimes. One day, felt better still sure it. Well restaurants gyms people near other, often maskless, extended periods time. places that. I've started wondering.. sub deleted kept sort ""historical moment"" subreddit? Damn. Lithuania seemed relatively well now. happened? Wtf supposed funny? keep dining him. fines cannot gotten rid bankruptcy he’s going likely lose years income time ends doesn’t give in.

The fact people keep going around law reason republicans refuse anything. pressure votes. literally passed outdoor dining ban 3-2 last week agree statement Every state sets vaccine priorities, yes, older first responder, would second wave many places. would guess 'no' that. 

But FB commenters, apparent FB law degrees, seem cheering knows. practice part parcel science. Pre-2020 common sense consideration actual human behavior essential good epidemiology, seems like epidemiology wants take page economics' book start assumption people automatons designed minimize spread disease. Confirms Oz (and/or NZ?) said months ago. Wish could reference this. recently heard Canadian numbers. It’s .6%, yeah, rare. Local govs pretty much best considering federal gov like 25% functional. one plans make better, anyway country strong Constitution really possible reform system. idk really worth complaining. Think law nature. extra. FDA gold-standard Recommending masks would possible yeah... would solve issues?

I say embarassing lean neighbors partner countries terms ICU capacity - summer Stockholm excess ICU capacity flew patients UK example. I'd say EU-cooperation countries terms transferring ICU capacity strength system. sure guys hearing reinfections rare. point it’s denialism. What’s wrong that? It’s John Hopkins University. Yeah I've seen comments lot like 70% restaurant go unemployment get it.

I feel like many people work home plum forgot many roles jobs closed business ""take out"" shit them. Also, people develop longer lasting cells it? create ADE pathways lead severe cases death? Hopefully something ends better nothing. People still need feed pay rent/mortgage. lol i’m annoyed fellow americans can’t seem sit still spread covid quoted imply covid harm dogs? I'd gladly take it, current incidence rates, way likely get infected vaccine available Europe. point government collecting taxes people can't even use help us we're need? seems money spent funding police agencies enforce law keep collecting taxes us hahaha.  Charlie Brown: got Lucy never heard repo man? got money, still got stuff... sub filled people high anxiety. Hell, lot people say, “I wasn’t tested but...” really take grain salt. “Homicidal?” Really? 

Lmfao really think data proves claim? realize 13x translates 130% less likely?? way small difference? many idiots here. Thejournal.ie (the linked website) comments an... interesting place times. That’s continue see mask mandates closures businesses essential people congregate community transmission happening want vaccinated are. decide wear mask, won’t going restaurants, gyms, grocery stores closed require masks service. go on, please tell us get eat restaurant closed indoor dining. Anything adults older, comorbidities, expect able receive vaccination? Also we'll need prove eligibility? really admire courage takes go government orders, media coverage, majority public opinion like keep business alive. Bet ass wal mart fitness business, wouldn’t closing shit. like isn’t forcing staff come in, doesn’t seem like you’d forced one way another mask issue based article. system heard one else industry cunt. Business owners shouldn’t pay dime fines. need send bill Dr. Fauchi Joe Biden. dirty Chinese money pay problem! talking Canada? I'm denigrating anyone safe. I'm denigrating someone shaming people safe things. Taking extreme measures make better people follow government regulations. 

Follow local health guidelines. That's ask people. Get ivory tower. agree entirely. last month partial lockdown nothing, cases higher start people worn out. even harder make people following guidance now, especially restrictions tightening Christmas. bawü curfew...I'm glad living virus taken relatively seriously, much difference approach states sometimes cities wonder control. feels like need central approach everyone follows coming month really drive numbers down. review place place.  life figure talking searched article word training. think see thought, think ""I'm virologist training"" means still learning? That's phrase used experts field, case medicine, say specialty is. Aside article literally stating expert, professor teaching virology 32 years PhD subject. country? prioritize based making sounds mouth? 80+ even risk natives speak passed over. Meanwhile whites patting back virtuous condemning people death others skip line. Convenient talk amount people getting sick, leave millions projected die herd immunity scenario! still know long-lasting effects virus, honestly I'd bet vaccine 99.9999% survival rate, that's better COVID, it? Even though know took ""99.7%"" from. California 41 50 states lowest rate per capita. They're far better states. Theoretically, situation describe could increase risk infection. shown practice? statistically verified data linking gyms spread virus, solely based model? feel bad businesses.

The business brazenly defy covid orders businesses vote government would provide aid situations.

I feel bad businesses followed rules, shut ever open back up. feel bad asshats all. true actually. seems like FHM expected take far time develop vaccine therefor adopted measures could sustained several years. Fortunately enough, got several vaccines record speeds, need that. mention loss income protection r cations people wealthy. run money food, housing life essentials vaccine make dent this. 


Governments across world failing people (except new Zealand Australia name few). breaking point? current rates virus killer en masse. fallout virus killer already is.

It's bomb worry nuclear fallout after. virus different cares less governments controlling world. virus give fuxk except infect others. 


Wear fucking mask enough leaders needs done care other. thin piece fabric, get fuck yourselves. result innocents killed would justaugh fucking morons. Everything said... validity stupid. funniest thing don’t trust vaccine made scientists cocaine Yeah start producing vaccine house deploy efficiently eradicated within year. Say China Japan, put minds something gets done *Santa* probably: Well gooooolleee, know coulda happened went strip club two days ago feel fine... I'm 30 yr old dialysis patient told end month patients work able get it. wonder it'll like eventually need mask place. started covid. Finally comment attack antivacc even though not, general, like said. Thanks. data gathered times many businesses partially closed?  Cool won’t get vaccinated others free indefinitely. Turkey reporting bunch cases yesterday.

People eat turkey thanksgiving, coincidence conspiracy? 🤔 people shut downs government financial assistance. Typically speaking is.  aren’t “freedom fighting” idiots I'm sure Reddit epidemiologist tell rare worry it. 

With said treatment Prisoners epidemic something criminal bought World courts thing possible. money laundering front gyms really make enough eat $10k/day? Maybe time career change (after covid course) Last days looking 263, 260, 260, 256. stupid, fact. 

I way call downtrend, arguing previous comment saying Sweden currently among worst world getting even worse. untrue, trend worse many countries. 

Why would decrease without lockdown miracle? time happen, enough people immune (or dead), enough people keep distance. clue happens, will. Christmas sure help anyway, many people ignoring recommendations. I’m really hoping there’s long term immunity like that. would really suck otherwise. high hopes different things time next year. Oh no!

Anyway... Oh great, comes “because it’s covid” brigade. think data supports claim part so? Expect around May especially Moderna J&amp;J get approved also. J&amp;J single shot vaccine infrastructure already mass produce. Could realistically vaccinate 200M so. 

Imagine rest population would pass won’t need much already got COVID... new case count Thursday 7,500 (total population around 10 million) absolutely massive jump Thanksgiving.

Guess I’m find it’s like hot spot within hot spot. Food prices insane, regular grocery bill risen least $100 compared 2019. I’m amazing weren’t downvoted posting memory leak   good reason debatable. Interesting. disagree. think makes sense leave discretion Sheriff, responsible housing inmates best position judge danger society. Sheriff chooses poorly, responsibility him. PPP dumbest thing ever.  certain businesses affected Virus.  Yet handed everyone even companies booming revenue. money amount forgiven based decline IRS reported revenue years 2020 2021. gyms opening given circumstances.

But - Amazon running massive warehouses undisturbed (as Walmart, etc.)?

This wealth transfer upwards. Fucking small businesses (gyms) favor massive conglomerates. amazing even reading conversation. accomplishment humankind.

That said, need relentless preventing next one. front? take we've learned year+ hell improve prevention, overall response/process. cannot end again. actually right problem Covid idiots cooped argument shut downs part “Covid isn’t serious” BS. intelligent perspective shut downs desperately needed, financial support ~~small businesses~~. People. Florida tourist economy worker here. money comes winter/spring break. Summer dead. economy killed. People running food. Landlords trying evict people.  Stalin's USSR defeated Hitler's Germany WW2 asking source Tegnell claiming ""that countries would worse Sweden strategy Sweden superior.""

Not claiming level immunity likely lead less spikes. mean hardly boast it? immunity works.   Something something transportation vaccine prep pay them...forcing closed multiple times without support pointless. cherry pick day really issue everywhere. Everyone wants blame government clear even restrictions numbers continue go up. 

This shifty selfish people issue simply can't enforce. government blaming issue. Mitch McConnell. One single republican damning whole country republicans ones allowing take blame. trashy indeed seem hard-on judging virtue signaling. understand interpreted ""hang there"" ""watch people die"" instead ""do feel best."" 

I'm advocating either position, laying business owners choosing they're doing. personally like largely become hermit since March. understand. Yep, also approved Health Canada. I'm Canadian full confidence process. miss gym much. closed March 3 months, opened July, closed September. 2 major breaks 3 + months. Ever since decided change life, lost weight started training, 2015, I've never breaks longer week. really killing me. motivation, self-esteem drains mentally. Apart physical health benefits appearance, gym helped mentally lot. Helped focus taught structure discipline. good things come time work them. It’s fine, good example genetic selection. Going lot less republicans around next year  read order, that's hold position.

We saying order simply release non-violent offenders, maybe people drug charges, avoid exactly this. meant (majority commenters sub) want hide fact love negative news upvote crap anything remotely suggests life behind masks rest eternity. 

Now you’d kindly stop Caps locking that’d great. bad virtually everywhere US. takes sone serious magical thinking believe one city spared virus rages everywhere else. inevitable LA would eventually hit. Mitch McConnell blocking everything really confusing taking Pelosi's statements regard. dems worked multiple drafts past months relief bills got rejected. one rejected one allowed massive benefits corporations removal watchdog organization make sure money went right places. important fact look case discussed behavioral patterns Swedes sub, lead commenter interpreted ""glee"" Sweden's failures -- specifics argument mortality displacement suddenly decided conjure. friend constantly attempting deflect, obfuscate derail discussion cherry picking parts able address, regardless context relevancy.  


If fellow Swede redditor wishes get answer question, needs understand history Swedish participation sub, filled constant contradictions, dishonesty complete disregard reality. care less feel antagonized properly address irrelevant argument -- free go find place receptive theories. truly hope improve situation country. don’t republicans pass stimulus bills aimed helping common people? right would reasonable say infections per day part-time county coroner rural county born actively encouraging members county get covid immunization. college degree. None. local cop Air Force reserves enlisted airman. making public declaration Facebook yet county board State/County Depts Public Health don’t reprimand him. also discouraged people getting annual flu immunizations every year. Anyway bring attention this? Ironically, Concord Mills Northeast Charlotte, sprawling Southpark Mall southwest. Southpark region Charlotte reputation massively overpriced traffic bad tons people surrounding area avoid it’s worth hassle.

We 7,500 positive tests Thursday, enormous jump 2 weeks ago. We’d mostly neck neck Virginia, thanks Trump rally 23,000 people days election seeding surrounding population covid, Thanksgiving crush devastating. might different guy, [twitter guy died still attending anti-mask rallies mid-november, guy already intubated 8 days November 7 rally. Also, guy died apparently protest leader rather local politician. However, information cases probably deliberately kept vague protect privacy. 

It would surprise even people caught bad case covid protests, given number attendants total absence precautions. Chill cold virus Pretty much anyone would. literally giving unlimited access anything feel better without proper medical evaluations determine said treatments actually needed helpful.

I've never taken hard drugs. would ever seek out. Freaking *antihistamines* give bad trip utterly hate feeling.

If doctor could freely prescribe anything want tremendous pain injury whatever? I'd writing new Nirvana songs breakneck pace. It’s also worthy r/notthethickofit ! kind hilarious realize small pathetic makes sound. Yes, think age end determining factor whether reside/work care home. vaccinate folks 80 everyone care home, likely reduce deaths significantly. 

Of course, America there’s telling states do. see distribution sloppy well managed, friends family folks vaccinations jump queue. hospital ends vaccinating staff (including fucking finance departments) vulnerable people queue. someone slated get late, working cardio.

Married someone getting early... hiding self defense equipment. :) people ""more equal"" you. Yup, used slickdeals week ago got 2 35 CT sanitizing wipes like $3 Australia going help impregnate women everyone cunt? kind banking vaccine, doesnt want chinese Well he’s Christian behaving. ""A preliminary study yet undergone peer review shown memory B cells found patients mild COVID-19 symptoms recovered cells persisted, **suggesting potential** longer-term immunity""

They think means long term immunity, sure yet. read article linked? Positivity rate case count dropped week so...yay? Meanwhile reality country 126 million people far fewer new Covid-19 cases Florida 21 million people 11,699 new cases.



So apparently measures work. dumb question realized needed read posting it. Sorry. Continue on. It’s meant general. I’m saying people won’t understand doctors treated administrators unless doctors make public. 

I believe doctors part reason system health care incentivized making money succeeded.

Maybe doctors eyes opened viewed least patients. There’s limited hero worship anymore. much realist also pushing back negativity examples worst people pandemic brought out. thing called pandemic kindness, collecting stories random acts kindness around world [featuring website podcast. Thanks! source data ""read Facebook""? miss it, definitely forget biggest humanitarian disaster far 21st century circumstances surrounding it. uk: *cries 21000 cases day* Keep pushing quaking boot narrative. really seems working you.

Happy trails. US great bad everything lol. 

Healthcare - 27th standards - 20s 40s 

We also 22 trillion dept GDP... 

America great since WW2. pregnancy aspect normal vaccine distribution, children pregnant women known vulnerable populations, get last every vaccine rollout.

False information help saddest part story residents impacted virus Gove County could reduced impact dramatically following logic, Science. Instead supported, bought bullshit administration ""Rules"" self-service rather public service. Fuck taking shit right *bat.*

I’ll stay quarantined watch rest guinea pigs trial “warp speed” vaccine. every downvote get comment thank personally little guinea pig. great next year? Sure I’ll take it. Great news! bc i’m person hates people hate people fun. 

sorry life sucks, rest don’t. don’t prick lmao Again. Goddammit, AZ. I’ll tune it. Thanks! “Can’t send somewhere far away? Like Santa Monica?” forgetting, Vaccine may even useful time everyone gets it.

It's spread MANY HOSTS, chance mutating vaccine longer providing protection new form virus.  know much sooner it’s effective numbers.

I’m betting everything back normal end 2021. many fortune tellers virus. Yeah see Dow! filters leaves people taking seriously going eat out

Very true. neighborhood primarily black mexican. drive restaurants year see outdoor diners, think neighborhood white neighborhood. Primarily white neighborhood retirees. know is, learned year way white people living neighborhood neighbor two doors down. Yeah, one person say me, ""Well really big deal make seem, *somebody* know gotten now?"" makes kind sense. Nobody know killed bear, mean bears exist.  

We live area recently, within last month so, started get hard-hit. easy people ignore done that. call 20k deaths 1.5 million infected terrifying, large numbers sure. clue either general feel like beneficial tax money ostensibly control (thru votes) rather slave benevolence billionaire. robust resilient system sustainable.

Sounds like it’s time find new circle friends limit contact family. yet Greenland proves plague inc simulation. blanket statement, kind fucked up. really. extremely easy disease spread individual goes high risk areas like gyms indoor dining clubs, likely exposed covid multiple times. Avoiding areas means likely spread likely saved someone's life.

I'd say statistically likely, especially consider many people US continue spread it. Awesome! Thanks. quickly mRNA vaccines confer immunity? western reporter got Sputnik V vaccine claimed become effective 40 days getting first shot. “200,000 ready million way!” ""*...tested positive 90 days longer.*  ""

""*Experts say subsequent positive test 90-day mark would likely detection leftover virus new infection.* "" Sad, true. You’re nuts. Sometimes people can’t deal stress constant caution throw wind.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wrote article literally states... Never going Kansas. Stupid people large numbers dangerous. There’s whole Fantastic 4 saga Hickman trying fulfill exactly fantasy superhero scale. 

Unfortunately that, too, ends disaster. unfortunately playing series seemingly unconnected events different stakeholders, continue years come. Everyone wake wars, civil unrest, refugee crisis take entire attention world leaders. still contentious even everyone agrees source problem starts fighting blame, late then.  current leadership Florida would guess next spring. Remember whole reason flattening curve hospitals don’t get overrun etc. etc. I'd wager nearly every nurse America wearing N95 masks already.

If sufficiently serious threat, freedoms suspended, necessary counter threat. Again, contingent threat actually recognized health authorities parliament. FHI says critical enough warrant measures, sure can't. government anyway. I'm trying claim that's case.

I'm saying Swedish constitution written sensible people sensible limitations various emergency measures used. mean never used. clearly stated can.

Well damn, guess AZ North Dakota West. Still better covid Yeah, think likely saw (or topic least)
The article: study:  Yeah, *after* already lose sense smell process gaining back. Part virus sucks due long incubation period (up 14 days even longer cases). sick, patients recover weeks. longer cycles take way long bank herd immunity. Also, patients lost immunity several months got infected again.

While concept herd immunity work diseases, Covid good disease test on. Sweden good example this.. strategy going well.

Also, IFR CFR same.

1. CFR disease proportion deaths disease compared total number people diagnosed disease (within certain period time). CFR ranges 0.2% babies, 30% elderly.
2. IFR, contrast, proportion deaths among infected individuals. IFR, unlike CFR, attempts account asymptomatic undiagnosed infections. IFR ranges 0.002% 9%

Last thing.. Dying concern. seeing long term organ damage patients. lungs kidneys, brain, liver, reproductive organs, several others. actually disagree. listen weekly podcast &amp; think he’s optimistic next summer, stating he’s aiming enjoy twins game grandchildren July 2021.

Sad reality. Pretty annoying keep comparing 9/11. Funny mention that. think Rhode Island set tent said would 1 doctor every 50 patients.  ""Double Secret Lock-down"" Yes, (and aren’t antivax doctors either). Generally guidance receive wait least quarter/half year vaccine rollout taking it. TENS/SJS generally happens within 3 weeks intake drug source.

I want make absolutely clear ANTIVAX. getting vaccinated. Baricitinib something since Remdisivir anything. Cool, good luck convincing people live like another 6-12 months. vaccine never meant eradicate virus, reduce hospitalizations deaths acceptable numbers go back normal. love ends every episode tribute someone lost, numbers big meaningless. telling individual stories powerful. I've also directing people [Frontline Families helps families frontline workers lost covid. dogs know Rona smelling, know Rona smelling 30 minutes vaccinate person two vaccinations per person 1 vaccination per hour 370 million hours 15 million days vaccinate America. could employ 15 million vaccinators done one day.. might revaccinate every 3 months?

Have loved one suffered long term affects Covid 19 vaccine? develop 2nd head, cancer, liver failure, grow tail? Call us! help you! Western media trying best demonize China nothing surprised at. look study findings bunch biased journalists publish op-eds. mean, sure, could reduce spending elsewhere move money Social Security Medicare, let's BS take overcome current shortfall.

Also, let's acknowledge military budget good bit smaller Social Security less half combined Medicare/SS spending. Yes, people *expected* got Bell's appendicitis died. really simple maths, guess one zealots never convinced.

So take vaccine, rest us.  Well least 5 major distributors make good promise production billions end 2021 could see lot developing nations receive substantial batches 2022. Definitely impossible. mRNA well understood, yes. transition sequence genome protein - like compiled code execution. 

What know specific implementation mRNA, coding sequence spike protein allow immune system recognize it, changes time. know permanent immunity, temporary. that, know happens, temporary, upon re-exposure.


The talk cytokine storms children reinfected (no vaccination, wild; also rare heavy grains salt) suggests interaction immune system straightforward would like. 

All know immunity achieved short timeframe, least months, minimal side effects. absolutely data +1 year out, none us say anything besides ""lets hope best"" really get ""shopping around"" attitude in-demand resource planet right now. Like sure difference safety, would take vaccine access wait months get slightly effective option? heat South Korea well: [New virus cases hit record high 950; strain medical system feared Question regarding vaccine trials. happens get placebo? eligible get actual vaccine released think headline means Alberta, Canada one entity. Alberta Canada. People actually take vacations to...Oklahoma?

Jesus, hopes there's big ass storm something otherwise dude paid go boring state absolutely nothing Well, bound shut conspiracy theorists thing I'm worried allergic reaction people reporting. I'm allergic penicillin asprin, really want vaccine. Bill Gates hero.  anyone analyzed Sturgis? didn’t think I’d ever here, really don’t care anymore. It’s like watching buffalo stampede cliff. successful country put burden COVID response citizens. government backs response, people inclined comply. I'm talking lockdowns mitigation like quantinine/isolation facilities, mass pro-active testing, financial support, on. Places like US trying stop COVID bizarre honor system Republicans can't fathom using government powers anything except war. least streets cleaned street cleaning! aren’t, ICU’s rarely full, especially entire regions.

And it’s flue, that’s exhaust sorts, flu, short influenza. Trump big part problem we’ve heading way society long time. Especially US prevailing ideology every man long time. population Canada still concentrated cities, get point. one though? flying chair please president influnce. Yeah, thread day said would 3 million vaccines US first week. gonna take bit time ramp production beyond that, sounds like lot vaccines, remember nearly 330M people US alone. rate going take 110 weeks, 2 YEARS get everyone vaccination. 

Now realize everyone get vaccinated production pick need live like mean time. flu death numbers? everything skewed Coronavirus? 2020 year everyone lost faith humanity. ""If vaccine hesitancy get way.""

Welp, we're boned. France many Covid deaths per capita, city streets covered dog shit. found Paris hugely disappointing gross. FYI. stilll HUGE amount get court order seize checking accounts, send sheriff seize equipment call vendors say”hey going seize business Friday don’t go ahead us pull equipment padlock doors “ vendors bad guys grocery delivery pandemic / lockdown area first happened. crushing, making 50+ / hr. CDC saying masks useless. 

Europe, Asia, Rest world?, ect wearing masks. relatives europe nurses. ""WEAR MASK!"". Anyways - got banned shipt shoppers subreddit arguing mod ""creating panic"". 9 months later - fuck /u/cajunflavoredbob Plenty 100M know COVID still using vaccine dose plus also know long immunity lasts others know they've covid get vaccine it.  Obviously aren’t following latest korea’s covid pandemic. months low rates come back vengeance. Yesterday 950 new cases. People got comfortable. True. takes much, much longer. 

The work involved change individual's mind spectrum moments years. along spectrum go, fewer
 willing invest time energy needed.

Societies must decide fraction vaccinated, quickly. time convinced. laggards either left behind required comply losing societal privileges safety. Exactly many “*most* 300,000?” Like, 160,000? know that? know people didn’t socially distance wear masks short period time? Wait... would socially distancing wearing masks short period time prevent covid deaths? Wouldn’t *delay* covid deaths? thing could prevent deaths form immunity. could still things now. lol available everyone months now. northeast, get break first wave June, 2 months lockdown. lol No. Pfizers Moderna's effective rolled approved. even sure Chinese one top 5 list potential vaccines Canada. I’m still gonna park ass home nothing, fuck lame shit. I'm likely get vaccine, rushed need time collect pattern long term side effects. Unfortunately, time find are, time we'll learn long approval drug vaccine anyway. think different able get funding participants way faster vaccine efforts. Yeah strategy need winter military enforced lockdown. OK state make vaccine? deliver itself? Notice stories creeping news low supplies vaccine, states receiving less planned for, etc? looked correct. Low infection rate high tracking compliance 
Lots testing  views fairly simple, grew time (I born 94). 9/11 people America acted differently, even limited exposure time period. 9/11, whether due shock attack, media, internet allowing faster spread information, shape form, average American seemed deeply change. became showing ""patriotic"" were, fairly short period time US became extremely nationalist. remember hearing sorts things attempted attacks anyone appeared US several years 9/11, though probably nothing new young know, something became talked media widespread. reason can't move fundamental culture change. Social security designed self funded. SS tax pays SS nothing else, nothing else pays SS SS tax. Using current military funding pay SS would massive change program designed. 8000 deaths day cause people stir action...

By late. 

That'll response. Followed ""why Biden something sooner! getting 8000 deaths day trump president!"" Companies don’t sick leave turn workforce disease vector RemindMe! 7 months But, changed equation. substituted death short-term financial gain, already something NZ made clear risking lives for. course lmao We're talking people who, least one viral nurses first-hand account, ton interactions patients using final breath insist find what's actually wrong can't possible COVID-19, insisting even they're die mere hours COVID-19, real.

We're literally dealing cult every definition. Joe six-pack wants bumper sticker slogan fits feelings political beliefs. What’s point? feel made big impact here? plenty bigger liars deal with, haven’t explained wrong snd correct thing is. people never admit mistake.

It’s like makes people happy complain Fauci months ago, don’t get why. doesn’t add anything desperate situation due leaders incompetence unwillingness financially support people. It’s easy figure it’s due Fauci.

Maybe move what’s happening now. bet like...”DAMNIT!” forgetting (nearly) 100M Americans already COVID? Plus nearly 500k getting infected every day? usually hate winter. warm weather person. especially hate snowstorms. We've got one predicted Wednesday DC metro area, first time life ever, welcoming bad potentially predicting, people stay in. argument see right they're actually dying things. Yes covid really died *checks notes* heart disease, conveniently timed. something. Sturgis sneezing contests bars...
I hope everyone went sturgis got corona Except little risk erectile dysfunction... antivacc general, case vaccine new would prefer take yet choice.

I saying never take it, maybe five years perhaps. 

And course, also want back normal asap, would prefer didnt take brand-new vaccine. vaccine 40 million doses 20 million people? Still, something optimistic happy about. Yeah, going on?? lol Melbourne locked 112 days. 

It severe worked. 

On day locked number covid patients France. Melbourne experienced 800 deaths since July local transmitted covid case 42 days, counting. France hand yesterday recorded 13,000 new cases 400 deaths. told don’t use viral particles Adrenovirus based exact conversation mom Thursday. going dangerous times indeed, tacked end dangerous times we've experienced year produced Monday going 300,000 deaths US. never bad. time, could ELI5 please? Imagine Covid without even basic modern medical care, even supplemental oxygen. 

Something simple corticosteroids would saved millions deadly cytokine storm. gets ED gets Bell’s palsy Dispersion evapaoration oxidization.

Corona virus RNA virus real robust outside cell thought would breakdown Thats sounds like sensible plea. freedom no. Red, white, blue eagle wins again! Ontop regular flue season fills ICUs anyways. Really disappointed state leadership. trained monkey could see coming. Super-Coronavirus becomes thing! It’s fascinating phenomenon.  western democracies least, we’ve fed diet limitless freedom long work pay tax good consumer. Individualism revered celebrated. 

As result, idea part community, skills required live one, seem lost. 

At time, leadership fanning flames tribalism sow divisions among us, order rule us.

Add COVID it’s perfect storm shake foundations cause fractures society.

Had COVID deadly is, don’t think it’s outlandish think could meant substantial setback civilisation know . Yeah, maybe... but, ya know... sub. hard tell. unsubscribed tempted come back get gist headlines... realize many scientific breakthroughs missed looking information own. 

People still argue primary mode transmission... meanwhile read back spring summer felt like I'd gone worm sub and, ways, still total cases

That means subjects reported symptoms, could cold, flu, covid, never positively tested covid. suppose report symptoms side effects, surprising 30k people, 10% kind cold/flu 2 months. would've thought would way easier creating vaccine gets injected hundreds millions...

So idea goes slow dogs. Availability price!!! I’m still waiting hear long immunity last it. hope people get second dose experiencing side effects first. LA reveals actual numbers. Unlike Florida. Yeah embarrassingly learned long time ago keep ability smell someone’s period long time ago. Thought making joke ended right. Fuck unconstitutional shut downs. Double huh? guess you’ve wearing mask since childhood protect things like smallpox measles (since vaccines aren’t 100% effective), correct? happy I'm actually seeing valid viewpoint reddit agree dispite political beliefs. Sometimes reddits shows massive echo chamber makes happy. Look like capitalism, unregulated late stage capitalism super deadly. hope change people realize this. human smelling abilities dog would experience it? Would enhanced version sense? Seems unlikely precise dog track scent. Whatabout. Great Gotcha! care

Unlike certain faction's cult personality, blindly idolize leaders. 

I support policies. hypocrites, would gladly prosecute Newsom Tromp elite fact, saved thousands lives business going go anyways bother closing fined? business gets fined business declares bankruptcy fines go away. people couldn’t define economy  Uhh title says 5 days SUPPOSED get married. seems like right thing postpone... Severely misinformed think generic gyms exist people go show off. can’t force business shut government order give people running stimulus compensation. live near mall. surprised happening there. Trashiest place town, going hill years. fine whatever want,” Knick said Friday. “I don’t it.”

These sound like words wise man's legal strategy. work greatly reduced. jobs months. largest projects working would huge impact advancement field terminated Sorry facts upset you. Glad Murphy letting data guide decisions. Get job useless Dr. Fauci hand making ban, agreed ban China, saved lives? make sure wearing gas masks &amp; start fogging Fogging uses antiviral disinfectant solution That’s lot dead consumers. economy! Honestly should’ve done better job protecting risk people. science needs looked more, think point lockdowns shouldn’t option anymore. screwing many people. Especially politicians making laws following themselves. 
But lockdown needs 1200 dollar check( never million years happen ) need take care business owners  I’ve isolating since took test Tuesday! Planning continuing that. weird situation! hope next tests come back negative!  3000 ICU beds opening every day America! irony. sarcastic? months away return normal Japan testing 30-40,000 per day population 126 million people. Since beginning pandemic tested less 4 million people. glad UK actually gives shit testing give population true idea things going. better, I'd recommend avoiding both. Walmart, Costco, Target sell food, essential. Same, could prolly make vaccine u tried resell xbox xmas Indoor dining never reopened LA wallet learn definition “super spreader”. Wolfpack! Huh? Europe cases high, new stay-at-home orders work well there's lockdown fatigue (everything open summer) people follow them.

Also period cases low. sensationalist bullshit. need lesson statistics. Gym: ""Don't worry idiot members paying us WAYYYYY enough pay fine, they're even using memberships!"" Yes, please! Vaccinate us get schools open safely ASAP. Moderna Pfizer mRNA. Well put. Unfortunately seems US, similar children, population follow rules they’re strictly enforced law. dumb vaccine prevents becoming ill, necessarily becoming contagious. read articles correctly really study whether vaccine recipients could still spreaders not. I’m shutdowns give businesses money need survive. countries it. can’t we? ""Fuck, farted? you, Frank?""

""No.""

""That's foul fuck. then, Patty?""

""Er... no.""

""Fartbot! Sniff asses.""

*Machine noises. Beeping. Printout.* Stephen Hawking voice: ""Patty dealt it."" Nope, go look historical data People aren’t oblivious cause effect, it’s many don’t believe cause! man willing die cause. need people like him. going gym everyday summer masks wipe downs strictly enforced. quit gym prob mid July everyone got complacent, one wearing masks one really cared enforce it. national guard serves state governors. CA guard takes orders Newsom, feds. Gym's disgusting, gone since February. live smaller city, day announced 40 people covid contact traced back gym. grunting, sweating, heavy breathing, putting lot aerosol virus air. believe you, source? honestly find much information fallback old white rich guy power, never failed still prioritized based ability speak dying language solely risk death. Native elder mean people 80+ elder much younger healthy someone simply speak dying language, one thousands already dead. immoral ridiculous. Mighty noble condemn stranger possible death someone else jump que. guess complicated bureaucratic system could made possible even recommend masks? quite embarrassing ask help neighbouring countries still simple thing done. love vaccines, think extremely beneficial humans personally pretty much ones had. Generic antivaxxers need shown iron lung get better idea important vaccines are.

That said, let's talk new ones. mrna ones completely new type vaccine widely tested basically trusting results private companies, held months rather decades. time peer review ?

I wondering go mrna route instead proven one extremely widespread important vaccine produced months ? safer path ? sure sounds safer me. Regarding research, idk. pandemic actually pressed fast forward vaccine development incredible way. learned lot. Enough help us vaccine development general help process whatever novel virus comes next. know still valid, cough syrup suppose avoided shown negative effect, earlier year 👍🏻  Reddit fun 😊 take final conclusion: ""I support shutdowns, without financial support"" ... financial support ain't coming. 

So therefore, open back safest way possible knowing full well COVID waves result. Pray rate infection lower rate vaccination. False negatives likely false positives test, I'd behave positive. Isolate take easy see happens. Yeah. live do. good business. Better get someone home safely kill someone bar serving them. Oh man that’s fucking awesome. 200 million doses Moderna, extra order 100 million second quarter? Dude we’re going pandemic crushed soon shit world. thought vaccinating 100 million risk people healthcare workers going get job done, looks like we’ll even doses work with. Definitely supports common notion May-June range normal. Thanks source! Another instance administration trying take credit doesn’t deserve. going say pressure applied, vaccine received expedited sign-off. like Trump signing stimulus checks. reality tv show. glad it’s little month he’s out. Go wolfpack! Lol No, not. That's emergency authorization, regular one. benefits giving vaccine public far outweigh costs so. 

The people saying lockdowns terrible, they're damaging mental health, children's education, economy right, that's still much better letting everyone catch covid. imperfect vaccine much better alternatives. Even side effects, side effects common damaging longterm effects covid? damaging lockdowns? enough information see far safest choice, that's need know. {MI\] 

# State reviewing possible COVID-19 reinfections 115 prisoners test positive twice

 include Governor Newsom birthday dinner expensive exclusive restaurant country?   want shut specific businesses rest them. sense make close restaurants gyms leave literally everything else open? comes distributed is. reaches point thst everyone wants vaccine could vaccine stop wearing mask. Prior thst continue di so. Likely similar saw start Wuhan, NYC, Italy, sadly. Back then, localities weren’t focusing masks, using vents far aggressively, throwing shit stuck. Now, dex know ventilators used. good point one reasons everyone take vaccine, take it. best protect people cannot take it.

That said, past four years taught anything, taking vaccine become political thing 40% won’t take it. hope I’m wrong. Never heard life tbh sure hope right, friend! Usually small demographic population test it. easier tell take find sample size big enough prove safe use entire birthing breast feeding process. However, runs long, well could prove safety cover demographics. know wife advised get flu vaccine last year baby could partial immunity passed womb. crossfit gym California also defying orders, gofundme setup members paying fines (on top paying $200/month). saw, fines couple grand far. doubt donations grow $100k.

I understand economic impact, bring ""we're boosting immune system, virus exist here,"" lose sympathy. Let guess, you’ve comfortably working home whole pandemic lmao There's plenty articles vets stepping volunteering.  I’m burning one masks filming it. way hell going wear mask there’s need mandate 👍 I’ve seen least two health care workers SuicideWatch agree. It’s hard change perception someone wholeheartedly believes something true. Pretending know things poor substitute knowing things... particularly age *science* lockdowns works US. *practice* not, government isn’t giving sort assistance businesses people get working. selfish entitled. Anyone tries point wrong. Donald Trump president Canada vast majority people idea KF94 means are. yes cheap widely available web America now. Yup, Amazon gunna get billion dollar checks congress massive amounts corporate welfare.

The rest ""ants"" left starve. hypocrisy already normalized, that's going effective. I’m 32, got covid survived, it’s 15 days now. didn’t feel like gonna die I’ve definitely sick life. virus random tho, 32 got didn’t even phase me, man 32 lost life.

RIP America, gtfo pandemic 1 percent population one week. means done 99 weeks! That’s year half. best friend’s sister’s boyfriend’s brother’s girlfriend heard guy knows kid who’s going girl saw Ferris pass-out 31 Flavors last night. guess it’s pretty serious. troll lol. speaking Johnson Johnson AstraZeneca. don’t know effective vaccines yet don’t conclusive data yet. Lol frustrating nuts? 

I revelation today. 

Telling people socialize like telling teenagers sex. simply incapable complying. don’t read Australian news? full statements government directly telling people come home mightn’t able later. Seems dumb even read Australian news expat global pandemic. Poster linked good reporting eg Guardian people still Trump distancing us WHO? That’s enough. US Government done better job securing vaccine Wow. amazing!! feel like we’ve turned corner pandemic, even won’t much first.  understand give us money? They're going end end anyway! get $1,200 we're gonna spend WalMarts supermarkets car dealerships medical corporations on. 

Look happens people get tax returns! run around spending money like drunken sailors! *Put fucking money people's hands, greedy bastards! We're gonna giving back anyway shop businesses, dumb fucks!!* quite morbid, COVID might significant positive impact solvency Social Security Medicare. mean, it’s common sense rich person donate charity poor person. advocate donating giving financially well off. mean part. places using consistently... History gets gory lack imagination? might pandemics grande finale speak.  worst probably easter.  going ""miraculously disappear"" taper vaccinations limit virus ability wreck havoc like currently is.  

Assuming dont see vaccine resistant strain emerge.  think thats unlikely but...  definitly impossible Interesting United States played pivotal role developing testing multiple vaccines may even benefit them. Exactly, could've pleaded private companies manufacture masks effective there's shortage  Ah finally  
  
Maybe CDC everyone solid call emergency approval meeting tomorrow instead Sunday people actually get vaccinated People can’t afford come back country taking risk stuck permanently. government (other taxpayers) bail decision? Quick, invade Iraq Bullshit headline. Article says otherwise This. Absolutely this. 👆👆 Could googled see shipping. Working state hospitals distribution operations. Planning who’s getting first shots. Shitty headline. article says wine fully restocked people keep buying them.

They restocking regularly still problem long-term effects literally untestable time passed. vaccine, mRNA treatments general, around long enough know whether everyone gets infertile, cancer, drop dead 10 years. None particularly likely, obviously situation relative risks need weighed, amount parallelization huge piles cash investigate long-term risks without lots time passing.   Christians loving false prophets, though. like even fear comodified now. Like here's straight fear mongering hear ""slop slop slop"". Jesus Christ. Lots downvoters get reference cannot embrace baobab tree. Well... end come... eventually?! Oy... countries mentioned, one ever said handling things particularly well. strong lockdowns beginning let things get control first place, yeah messed allowing second wave get bad knowledge happened before. however made good faith effort try stop virus times, governments bad public image.

To me, seems like allowed many people die America also hurt economy even more. mention negative effects lockdown people endure year.

The fact let second wave get control makes doubt 'good faith' effort part. year, two diners South Korean restaurant infected novel coronavirus matter minutes third patron sat least 15 feet away them. third patron asymptomatic time. dissecting scene June, South Korean researchers released study last month Journal Korean Medical Science suggests virus, certain airflow conditions, travels farther six feet infect others little five study appears bad news restaurants, already identified research primary source spread virus. Korean researchers recommend public health authorities update safety guidelines based study, arguing six feet space tables enough protect diners infected.  Two thirds Americans one co-morbidities ppl got covid asymptomatic mild means might effectively immunized putting risk cuz happened get 9 months ago might get right cruel opinion Shocker. Remember year go happened, antivaxers fringe minority. Hated all, even crazy r/conspiracy laughed there.

There always speculation lived smallpox polio epidemic saw alternative world without vaccines would quickly change minds.

I'm absolutely astounded seemingly opposite happened. Antivax numbers appear increased dramatically pandemic. blows mind. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article   “What happens going depend behavior today.”

That's reassuring all. American here, define “nappies” context? spent enough time crown colonies know means something recall referring diapers..

Gotta 50 states figure own, places like rural update NY urban Houston. state needs tailor demographics - rural states like NY one way, urban states like Texas other. There's definitely huge added value single ""center"" controlling disease handles urban rural places. Yes Brazil's mines crippled COVID, result Australia's mines raking billions windfall profits. One derived pleasure considering Bolsinaro allowed many citizens die. use government care citizens?

Which citizens though? outside Australia, many currently trying avoid covid? late get Pfizer vaccine, they're already sold Q3. That's accept government money; could sell highest bidder instead. US funded Moderna vaccine leverage there.  short-circuited brain ""though FDA analysis says available information allow firm conclusion potential effect.""

They 3 weeks initial injection second injection. That's data had. way conclude level confidence within 3 week window, know effectiveness without actually trialing candidates one shot.  Well, day earlier. 

Let’s give credit 3000 lives saved (although wildly optimistic since it’s likely less approval date production rollout capacity). 

Doesn’t really balance scales, though, it, consider many tens thousands needlessly dead due horrendous administration response, politicization masks, PPE diversions, refusal buy additional doses etc etc etc Right, question he's really financially astute, giving advice anyone else says way people want hear. America first world *by definition*, since allied West cold war.

In modern definitions, America developed nation, high ratings HDI. way.  Followed new years resolutions... I'm sure lot people saying want get social resolution.. Surely USA hopeful thinking.

Our leaders believe one time payment $1200 shall see us fine. Ok Imagine thinking degree keeps idiot Ben Carson Neurosurgeon  problem wait long commit people get ahead line. US order need donate allies. Several days earlier first admitted case (early Dec. 2019) Wuhan. Right, could highly susceptible disease know it. intents purposes, that's random enough. like buying diverse portfolio, almost investing Tesla 4 years ago. It’s fun look back think “what if” since Tesla done well, that’s needs taken as. Sure, insight future knew Pfizer going first 95% effective, would buy way it. 

But project warp speed looked two different companies working similarly mechanismed vaccine, mRNA ones Pfizer Moderna. wise thing putting eggs one basket, diversified across different vaccine types. Remember huge medical advancement, mRNA virus never created before. 

And keeping news would see bought 100 million Moderna, worked closer freedom buy doses with.

I get coming Trump shitty therefore things must shitty approach, pandemic killing hundreds thousands Americans, it’s time step back, even though probably politically aligned (progressive liberals whattup?), decisions looked objectively. Thank mr. Trump Good luck! Thanks link. Post open publication policy coronavirus articles, erratic applying it. Wait $50 dick program real excellent joke Yet. Sort sounds like right wing nut job.

(Also it’s “affected”.) I'm 100% sure USA prioritises HIV unfortunately Australia qualifies free vaccines anti retrovirals (my meds) I'm extremely confident we'll get priority here. Every time go check make sure I've vaccinations available including limited supply ones.  seriously thank 'We assume breath water we're 30 feet way back. would stupid.' like 180,000 270,000 dead 2-3 months?  wouldn’t say that, record cases now, compared US seems much better. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Here's simple math everyone. Let's say assume vaccine 95% effective. take take 20 times risks taking, cancelling benefits.

Yes, know work exactly like that. vaccine going work much, much better us continue wear masks distance whenever possible community spread down.

Sometimes HIV benefits guesa  runs radio show. get source? heard this, see 98% people study immunity 6 months. 4 expected result must meaningful, otherwise would expected. statistical anomaly stop calling expected result.

I always concerned placebo group behaves different vaccine group.

Let's forget polio vaccine issue affected 1 2.4 million. cause number small mean relevant.

""In 1 every 2.4 million recipients, live, weakened virus contained oral polio vaccine causes paralysis."" Last heard objection guidance vaccinating 16 yr olds instead 18 up. nothing relevant many, many us. It’s still Trump.

He wants credit vaccine, he’s got take lumps too. 100,000,000 doses promised new year.

He kept touting already stockpiles stuff, yet largely lie things says are. First responders getting first. makes feel better I’m idiot smokes asthma tested positive month ago completely asymptomatic.

Probably not, people still can, something along lines makes sense. tried see vaccine prevented symptoms still somehow vaccinated people still infectious period time find much. rate scientist going tell sure without absolute proof.  
About month vaccine widely available people stop wearing masks. That's kind dishonest assessment. get advice grandma mean bad advice. People actually *listen* him. That's makes valuable. Wouldn’t better hound voted against? fear mob may make informed decisions harder follow laterz there's whole lot us staying home :-) I'd interested see examples ""emergency vaccines"" votes council looked like. normal split vote? can't first emergency vaccine history mankind process look like? mistakes made vaccines, ever? emergency vaccines done great hurry expedience problems vaccines approved ""normal"" timespan research clinical trials? hope epidemiologist reading respond. Genuinely curious. Sounds good lull, enough anyone. I'm sure, say certainty Italy Italy Europe.  get it. I'm losing shit too. made far. need stay positive motivated comments like ruin damn night. this. this! facility major Chicago metro/suburban area. High population facilities given priority Illinois least. received 2900 doses. site wide scheduling page booked within hours! average person lives less 30,000 days per year.  OP right. Odds someone gets vaccine get shot killed within first week.  media twist say take vaccine might get shot. Inject now. I’ll gladly friend people want know One hopes good news, neither UAE China known transparency. data released scrutinized scientists, science press release. Lovely true tried make clear comment Mexico’s testing extremely inadequate. I’m going case numbers, test numbers. 

Mexico: 1.229 million cases 129 million people = 9.5 cases every thousand people

US: 16.295 million cases 332 million people = 49.1 cases every thousand people (this 5.2 times greater Mexico’s number).

The thing routine screenings college kids letting anyone get test want common many parts US tests come negative. testing comes diminishing returns. incredibly base, wrote correct, honestly fail see correlation wrote person replied wrote.

Having small chance getting COVID receiving jab due vaccine 90+% effective nothing like "" still get covid vaccine less likely get symptoms kill you.""

Honestly, get correct, bother sharing bullshit like did. 3000 additional deaths attributed easily preventable cause, then. Still tragedy, weird you’re trying minimize it. amazing! It’s fastest vaccine ever developed! Amazing. Hopefully they’re able produce amount doses necessary actual herd immunity possible. also hope pfizer work manufacturers pump even vaccinations. Actually, fairly typical Christian behavior right now. 
Sadly It'll first good breakup lol U.S. gave final go-ahead Friday nation’s first COVID-19 vaccine, marking could beginning end outbreak killed nearly 300,000 Americans.* need thank maintaining social distancing, stay home xmas, wear masks enough people get vaccinated. entire family got infected thanksgiving. thank god didn’t go applaud optimism. collective behavior far encouraging. paid content way.

To ensure fake news permanent fixture society, yes.   ASS NEEDS VACCINE PLEASE READY Deaths average \~two weeks infection.

Then need people get two doses, another month so.

And need significant portion vulnerable population (60+) vaccinated.

So real effect seen March.  Huh mean depression classified pessimism bias? 15 days seemed like year lol post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Image kids losing year school (though IMO need keep kids school pandemic rages). Can’t underestimate hit mental health &amp; it’ll stay them. New York still conducting independent study.

We're dealing last 5%. genuine financial hardship ought scheme lend money see paying free travel people large majority chose stay away recently. understand it, vaccine contain virus. get vaccine mean exposed virus. vaccine widely available, people choose get own. means vaccinated next couple weeks. science referring to? matters, Dutch president Rutte said thing.

Thank everyone made happen. Great moment, hopefully get people need quick. proposed haughtily way based stated expertise real facts back anything. 5 months, months multiple different vaccines requiring 2 doses (Pfizer, Moderna, couple months probably AstraZ). I'm sure supply interruptions make news push back people get first doses. let's see vaccines major supply issues then, like kind thing would wipe 3 weeks worth doses.

If so, gladly say ""damn, idea talking about. right, I'm sorry.""

If not, I'm going say fuck you.  massive amount, side-effects efficaciousness need tracked. deaths hospitalizations it, numbers need close expected possible, mechanisms understood. really ironic context ""render unto caesar's his"" said drive home point christians supposed follow laws land long conflict god's laws. 

There's fucking law bible wearing masks, staying distant, quarantining away church due illness (that last one especially hilarious since quarantine biblical principle first place). almost certainly true. Even not-strictly-covid deaths increase, a) healthcare workers stretched thin, b) people avoid going hospital want *catch* covid19, die preventable causes. Yes, they're either, terrorists, Socialists, communists. everyone vaccinated once, one month large portion US vaccinated safer don't/can't/won't herd immunity rate yet? Isnt mortality rate Covid estimated 0.1 0.5? 0.2% dead - surely involves undercounting - see effects herd immunity assuming reinfections rare? We're similar situation. sucks try right thing get much pushback. 

That's ok though, religious people never liked actual Jesus. Capitalism mismanagement response caused crisis bad is. profitable prepare epidemics viral outbreaks US healthcare system didn't. Wtf? Mine triaging planning distribution weeks. They’ve surveyed whole staff interest laid exact order receive it. Starting people giving vaccines first. can’t wait!!! 🥲 Sorry, didn’t articulate well. It’s mainly strange side effects Covid seem much worse personally, yet friends act like vaccine way dangerous(and haven’t read studies). understand want research data feel it’s safe, true hope time available able really look data open mind. 

Here page Covid side effects reference. Pretty sure wearing mask part job smh.  think everyone skeptical question thoroughly bodies. many, including me, new vaccine without much history, several failed vaccines get shut down, putting body single year, less testing.     Like, complete normality? don’t want lose income all. want another option income earn safely. 

My mother job you. sacrificed people like families economy still sucks makes sad angry. makes crazy socialist, fine. like mom alive. begins zombie apocalypse Currently boy Milan, Italy Nov.  damn near impossible get covid test cvs near me, fuck ton them. suppose vaccine easier lab work required see vaccine 95% effective -- there's 5% chance killing people every time go outside. That's completely unacceptable. Every time perform nonessential activity, putting people's lives risk. One death one many. Stay fuck home. certain demographic doesn’t comprehend 1 1,000 get random disease ~1 1,000 takes vaccine come it. Besides 4,000 people get disease save million lives, end pandemic, it. Definitely. Go high risks, doctors, teachers, entertainment. I'm big NBA fan compared sports, couple thousand doses provide entertainment 7.5 million people good value imo. Ehhh that's everything. Oh there's only, Russia, North Korea Saudi Arabia! occasional visit Sweden best people, stay long visit. LONG REMAIN AFRAID FELLOW HUMAN BEING. COMPLETELY YOU! Deaths issue US. Deaths worldwide problem. Everyone sharing information treat prevent this. guess difference would rather small anything all. disagree, I'm saying I'd surprised already modeled over. applicable vaccine, any. even not, wait vaccines available figure out.

If ""disease A"" spreads population rate ""xyz"", one dose vaccine ""X""% effective one dose, ""Y%"" effective two doses, half adoption, happens?

I know, I'm simplifying greatly, that's general thought. patient. Wait till next week. Doctors great diagnosing illness treating people. many doctors, especially Med school 20+ years really complex grasp immunology vaccine development etc work. Unfortunately people appeal authority MD assume know they're talking about. category Fauci health care workers. one other. read constant pop ups ads taking over? give up!  Nobody comment thread even talking vaccines you. Try harder.  Republicans don’t want want said..... Damn scientists!!

Let’s show prove wrong ! plan:

1) masks outside time 

2) planned shopping means:
   - online possible 

   - store hours (if possible) always mask 

   - store shop elderly neighbors leave groceries outside better.


3) distance, distance, keep polite distance. Greet meet show care.

4) family reunions person type. virtual.

I know tough, want prove CDC wrong ! work together February comes show wrong crackpot scientists were!! company people back office soon possibly can. can't stand able keep eye everyone. Liability reduction reason WFH moment. Close fucking playgrounds!! /s Good luck. many people reddit whining want keep wearing masks vaccine released. Especially since positivity rates (especially SD) roof, around 40% SD. Probably least 30% SD coronavirus. No, back challenge election results. unclear safe is, unclear effective is. Even 60% that's better 0. saying mirror? It’s way makes sense 😂😂 people matter. actually tested sterilizing immunity mean it.

It likely highly effective can't declare directly tested businesses plan demand drops 90%. Usually something like happens, business plan go business. sound good 3mil per week 100+ weeks herd immunity Someone said 50% effective makes sense we'd go 2 doses true. Thanks. We're going need warn people may still spread getting vaccinated. course we're already far behind screw education I'm hopeful, individually share networks FYI, would enough original $1,200 checks, plus another $600 so.

For context 34,157 died flu 2018-19 last 2 weeks seen COVID deaths that. Hello! need advice! I’m confused! friend exposed COVID Thanksgiving (11/26). tested positive 12/4 (but test came back Monday, 12/7). then, took another test negative. took rapid PCR test 12/8 - rapid positive PCR saying negative. really know believe! got another test (today 14 days since exposure) make sure I’m really confused. research, I’ve seen lot recent articles saying rapid tests inaccurate! false negatives positives possible. feel symptoms I’m really confused actually COVID. Thoughts? think herd immunity stupid thing aim many people die, right we’re actually estimated like 17% infected country. covid19-projections.com give exact number want control another persons actions. Nothing selfish that.

I also get extreme winter weather live, adequate indoor space workout in. yes, lot barriers working winter.   KN95s/KF94s good enough literally sell 10 packs local supermarkets.

There consumer PPE shortage.

People wearing bandanas single layer cotton masks face feel like it.  People invent something, apply patent, adapt something new meantime. much energy spent something trivial wearing mask. addressed several comments ago: nothing stops working tremendous shape. dont need gym that. 

Just say selfish done fruitless conversation. That's truth. know it. want want do. Dont know hard admit that. Incredible mitigation effort, truly impressed Hell let it. I’m dentist stab people every day. don’t even pay me. I’ll day Well holy shit. solution strings attached money, never would thought throwing taxpayer dollars something would make difference.

-sk33tshot really bad trolling liberals acting like divisive republican piece garbage contributes nothing society span multiple decades generations. We're seeing effects herd immunity - second waves far much less first news saying that. numbers here. really think cases people don’t wear masks grocery stores? sexy version it. everyone made happen.

Especially you, Mr Trump, operation warp speed. else possible early. wish smart patient enough read understand this. sure data presenting compares vaccine efficacy presented **The 95% credible interval vaccine efficacy 90.3% to97.6%, indicating true least 90.3% 97.5% probability, met pre-specified success criterion.** sector, agriculture, someone trained dog detect specific kind insect infestation. helped dramatically increase speed able find segregate plants prevent spread throughout crop.

The main issue length time (and expense) train animal. think one dog cost $50K. miss Agreed. Without federal support, good choices anyone right now. Young healthcare workers rush take all. Let vulnerable guinea pigs first. I’ll believe see USA = lawsuits everything, would imagined business would likely try sort settlement instead taking court evidence that?  Maybe need actuaries balance costs out. Italy Spain seem better. also easy support lockdowns getting extra $600/wk employment I'll get soon possible, understand elderly front line go first Well again, curbside pickup delivery income. programs PPP SBA loans, CA another program. There’s also federal local grants. talking hindsight should’ve done initially.

In situations sometimes people may really dark place mentally knowing people around least acknowledge struggles rooting great boost.

I hope makes okay get deaths.  Local media challenge afraid him. Regional media really care place middle nowhere. totally believe concept free speech. However person enormous sway people taking guidance medical fact. ""streered conversation"" minds deluded Swedes yourself, unable objectively asses written paragraph without focusing exclusively whatever feel need protect Sweden from. 

In March spent lot time debating fine details Swedes claiming. claim ""doing whatever derail discussion"" dishonest nonsense straight lie. 

I perfectly understand beyond make sense what's going on. That's ok. Like said - free find place else would accommodating mental capacities. seriously going write increased cases depression, anxiety, abuse boredom? doctor's offices hospitals closed non-emergency visits, many cases undiagnosed.

When people jobs, crime goes up, hunger goes up, etc. Reddit, solution ""let government fix everything"". fucking travesty burning shit it. week ago took covid test (PCR test) tested positive covid. took another test Wednesday tested negative. I've virtually asymptomatic outside losing taste smell. 

How much trust negative covid test? family taking seriously am. (they've parroting ""false positive"" rhetoric last days without actually citing facts.

I want kill anyone. get point gotta think health workers, too. still take care person want get vaccinated. Gyms fitness centers closed, NCAA Professional sport team centers open. 

Hmmm. whole purpose panels experts give opinions. feels like process quick might overlooking longer term impacts. think that's pretty valid concern even perfect. understand matter people gonna die right? walk 2km train station day go worm wearing mask, I've never breath. work hot kitchen 8 hours mask, zero issues there.

This NZ btw.

You snowflake. Dude, really leave then. Go try countries. Tengell Giesecke dismissive virus beginning. Tengell told world sorts bs like can’t stop it, lockdowns pointless, border closing ridiculous, people without symptoms don’t account spread, there’s evidence masks work etc etc 
That set stage things now. 
Honestly it’s shameful say it’s unavoidable true. 
They absolutely still giving strict advice now. need finely adjust anything. It’s ridiculous What? received testing vaccines receive. variety reasons *seems* rushed, it’s not. place I've heard happening Walking Dead. OP yes they're right. Anyone calling reopening delaying inevitable financial downturn covid cause keep letting spread uncontrollably. public every day killing people straight up. hard everyone rn everyone needs make sacrafices good everyone. everyone sides aisle calling shutdowns financial relief people mess. reopen crowd caused this. preventative measures resources organizations like CDC others avoiding. also far biggest pedophile breeding training ground Earth mention that. people armed protesting legitimate election guy win. Even food shortage half country would blame ""Mexicans"" ""China"" they're afraid admitting wrong. fairly useless article.

The vast majority people eligible get vaccine months. are, way vaccines administered going different one state another. People eligible need check see vaccinations done area. Honestly? fully get that. work Covid+ patients asked wear N95 days time. 

Sometimes switch mask nobody looking get brand new one. feel bad it, also want die people. 

I hope use personal liberty stay fuck home die like men beds, inevitably get sick. Yet stillhas money today could ever spend 50 lifetimes gives away trickle publicity. gets richer every year actually. get started collective people handled it. Oh yeah. 

There way John Q. Sixpack gets Regeneron.   Kokomo “Kokomo Wellness Center”, guess that’s health department set free tests, didn’t know going even rapid test Net excess deaths considerably Japan, regardless unaccounted COVID deaths, people's lives saved normal year. Short-sighted? so?

Are getting vaccine? they're anti-vaccine case single important vaccine today? So, anti-vax short? 

If offensive called are.....I dunno man  300,000 dead. spin way want. think it’s serious treated seriously. took seriously 2-3 weeks could done it. need buy toys Walmart. What? Living close proximity infected person exposure dogs get. Yes well.

They really double dip. Yeah well CDC ain't listening doctors Scientists frontlines comes overwhelming data resources existing preventative measures drastically reduce covid cases increase currently fighting virus. CDC NHS even getting information public either.  low deaths 9/11 happening everyday. dont get gamble people's lives. Like gym... spray bottle water half-cap bleach paper towels.

Or, fancy, empty sani-wipe station. Good. UK Americans call ""binge drinking"" normal day us. Sounds like February so. Probably couldn’t spell economy either. Japan needs review Pfizer data...what waiting for? They're breaking law, like law go work change it.  Alabama. Challenge spouts nonsense, try get local/regional media involved.

America kicking people giving ammo people think whole thing sham faked media Chinese scientists back tested November 1st also back test would test dog Rona owner known infected? Thing gyms (at least UK) majority people want stay open, abide rules. vast majority gym respect 2m rule, wear masks moving around building clean equipment done it. Admittedly increased risk people breathing heavily sweating, pretty well ventilated compared buildings too. 

I remember seeing stat England went second 'lockdown' last month gyms equated 160 covid cases total, nothing grand scheme things. think Canadians knew AB would get stats like US. propose “sacrifice months” without income? I’ve seen many gyms last 8 months, masks, close proximity, bad air flow, people breathing heavily. 

Wish schedule time solution vs close completely. That’s happy middle ground imo. Part job duties include reporting numbers patients hospitalized influenza hospital health department daily. cases influenza year yet. keep double checking make sure I'm missing anything. unbelievable. This. Nailed it. Oh I’ll show oral consent, OP get fined.' Uhhhh..from CDC. agree. even worth arguing proud boys internet. Wow particularly. fatality rate almost entirely function age people infected. Diamond Princess natural population, lot people old young.

75+: 14% doesn't. Testing equal higher prior years.  communism already like seriously much shit forced thru realizing shit current system is? 300,000 died outside gym? rest country doing? But, got yours, it’s cool - yah? fool question advice Health Canada. Full stop. without global problem. regular volunteer. I’m surprised allowing volunteers care homes. least need testing. Congratulations happy you! 9/11 day foreseeable future. 1) say disagree you? asked suggestion
2) “people like me” look suggestions find better solutions. defensiveness conversation leads believe “one people” already thinks know everything wants argue instead figure better way Bats anywhere near Wuhan. city size feel Chicago.

The bats 99.1% genetic similarities found Yunnan, 1000+ miles away. 99.1% decades centuries evolution away 100%. I’m genuinely curious think gets us back normal point.

Originally hospital capacity. soon vaccinate elderly concern gone. risk death covid basically zero remove group too.

So think gets us back normal. saying, rather people choke death die boredom? Yep. Going walk definitely replacement gym. 

Jeez people stupid.

The answer don’t know somewhat decent solution problem isn’t supported Mitch friends.

I default towards keeping non-essential businesses closed, regardless whether assistance not, it’s easy say roof stays head whether open closed. 'at least half' horrible failure people masked up, less sweaty germ swapping gym. think we’re going see incredible increase mental health issues suicides next several years based happened last year. people depressed forced winter dark business owners required shutdown lose income help government.  Meanwhile covid deaths highly correlated obesity 200 k yearly preventable deaths due CV disease.

Maybe ban fast food instead? Arrest people eating fried chicken? Incorrect. still testing influenza a/b higher rates last year. steps taken control COVID-19 sideeffect completely decimating influenza year.

It shows much dangerous virus compared 'flu'. Covid contagious flu. that, rest logically follows.

If divide reproductive rate diseases, by, say, 2, given environment mitigation measures (with Covid starting 2.5 flu 1.3) given period time, logically inescapable Covid spread exponentially period flu's chains transmission take much.

It's relatively much difficult get transmission rate Covid 1 (hovering around 1.1 - 1.4 US since October). get even remotely close, flu inevitably crushed. part population called idiots Business owners los livelihoods, folks lose lives. business owners opening taking risks people's lives. That's part that's OK. final conclusion government wont provide financial support, time new government will.  can't workout anywhere besides gym, extremely ignorant truly exercise. what?

are trying prove can't read? Wonder what’s holding seeing masks requirement. Swedes anything unless they’re forced to? That's fair, think people partially responsible ignoring guidance? Yeah feeling temporary. pass stimulus want entice healthcare workers refuse vaccine, get fired collect stimulus. I’m going chase tour company I’m good hands. chaser leads tours chasing long I’ve alive. comparing apples apples there. increase depression anxiety abuse. said seriously doubt add 280,000 COUNTING.

This really need much debate + Victoria, Australia barely cases last month. state pretty much re-opened.

Lockdowns forced masks work. Period. Whether work long term short term, another question. question save thousands lives. Holy shit go run dense idiot.

Do pushups. Buy pullup bar like $20.

Boom, full body workout. way back May. Also sequencing done confirm reinfection dormant infection never cleared. lack training understand what's going immediately indicate incorrect. agree businesses financial support shutdowns, literally putting money saving lives.

Literally every decision make putting money saving lives.

How many people die economic problems caused shut down? [Every time unemployment goes 1 percentage point risk dying goes Given [on normal year (2018) 2.8 million people die 1% unemployment point raise killed 170 000 people.

How many percentage points unemployment think lockdowns going cause? many times going pay 170 000 lives keep lockdown? Mexico? close 175 people hour tuberculosis. 
Doctors say eradicate tuberculosis proper funding yet focus that. Why? rarely effects rich people. Classic reddit, calling guy forced shutdown regardless masking compliance homicidal asshole. hope enjoying cushy middle class job allows sit computer home. ... precautions? lighting scented candle giving thoughts prayers?  Republicans agreed bail normal people normal businesses (not huge corporate donors) they’d admit along possible provide help people kick scream socialism welfare.

It’s mind blowing entire party runs mostly idea everyone fend need help you’re failure deserve nothing. anti-thisvax not?

Ben Carson neuro-surgeon.

The authority trust topic immunologists. choosing ignore post saying (as nation) helping closed businesses? ""Reddit"" single entity, plenty sympathy businesses. you? Glad left too. Damn. cannot limit forever. long overwhelm hospitals deal it. It’s irrelevant - doesn’t money, can’t pay them.

Fines levied business, individual, that’s people incorporate - stop liability coming onto personally. Here's counter-counter analogy. rise Planet Bears. Bear attack victims making can't get hospital treat diabetic shock. responsible death? Diabetes bears? fine analogy, problem whether see COVID diabetes bear attack. Branch Covidians arguing COVID diabetes, clearly not. scenario comparing acute illness/injury vs. one chronic, managed illnesses. thinking COVID vs diabetes (or one risk factors) COVID clearly bear, diabetes.

And that's ignoring discussion Excess Mortality figures, things like bear attacks car accidents heart attacks cancer deaths already factored in. seeing huge increase deaths average can't ignored explained away anything COVID.

And correct, died bear (COVID) attack! That's point trying make whatever. might past, net positive money go? Send Lawyers, guns money. shit hit fan. Maybe that's part drivel actually addressed, rest unfalsifiable statements amateur psychoanalysis Swedish collective psyche.

You're also reinforcing point attacking intellect, EXACTLY last spring, throw brainwashing card it? think people would take seriously act like petulant child. Well money go rich businesses. know important ones. guess depends circumstances honestly. support need people involved survive. wouldn’t support already well didn’t want sell beach house. Really need financial support effected businesses  Plus flu vaccines degree naturally acquired immunity. may change full FDA approval, rather emergency approval. one voted for? one saying virus hoax, wear masks, follow restrictions....

libs?...which party got checks 8 months ago? one blocking now? talking infection rate meaning many test positive divided total pos+neg confirmed? Theres always going lag based busy labs are. 

I tested wait 14 days hear negative, would added day confirmed negative. adds sooo much time infections. Rate isn’t true “as happens” rather lab says so. 

This thing obviously spreads tight areas, whether it’s events, larger cities. fully believe masks help, also believe Cuomo punishing small businesses severely. 1,000 likes Federal government doesn’t money either. ability distribute Monopoly money. makes progress India spectacular. saw someone Best Buy one even smaller woman’s mask. barely covered dudes mouth.

Sure, people actually wore masks properly, washed hands thoroughly generally sliver trust government followed direction. that's world live in. mean, contact tracing, there's real way know zero cases came there. people Washington (the state) protest lack financial aid?

Saying thousands pages dense text valid excuse.

If speed process pandemic maybe time reconsider FDA's gatekeeper status. Phizer submitted vaccine approval 20th FDA even start looking December. thousands people dying everyday need FDA. Comparing Europe US like comparing evolved homosapien neanderthal “Check sub dedicated confirmation bias anecdotes info!” shit hole without corona 😉 Notice stories creeping news low supplies vaccine, states receiving less planned for, etc?

Links? 170,000 doses 15th I’m sure ask would happy give detailed explanation. One neurosurgeon decades training. 

I clarified get flu vax. Hard call anti vax. Except that's true. Hey that's capitalism, baby. feel bad. saved / bought insurance / pivoted business-model / pulled bootstraps.

At least that's businesses tell plebs get laid off, planned bad weather. That's companies dad construction work dried recession benefited rich buy cheap property.

These business owners ones telling everyone capitalism amazing socialism safety nets bad. boat rum gone? People south 🙄 Therefore, businesses receiving adequate compensation, support businesses defying lockdown orders. better one didn’t tip. also need alive live. places payments need go? depend income too.  fines follow him. problem first gym closes can't move shit new gym. government collect debt seizing gym's assets. He'll buy new stuff new gym.  shut even poor attempt hygiene enough stop flu. Sars-Cov-2 far contagious. would mean even deaths linked COVID? probably 0/10. guess heads roll point. :/ sure hell better raise deficit one penny! Yeah took while, getting point, got there. repeat Sigh.. make difference them.  Yes, problem using engineered common cold coronavirus, full dose might trained immune system attack engineered virus, 2nd dose effective expected. using two different viral vectors might get around problem.

 effect discovered accident, participants got half first dose error seemed get better protection. that's case, give single doses low-risk population (under 40, comorbidities, frontline workers, etc.), get people vaccinated way?  Keep plague rats away us Canadians three prohibit severe Covid (hospitalization). AZ one available me, that's likely given pecking order, happily take it. Please keep mind non mask wearing assholes socially distancing also loud mouthed bullies. course everything power make numbers appear stronger really are.
Unfortunately take lot people fuck everyone comes viral spread either :/ pretty incredible here. us wait months, really light end tunnel. well unfortunately. unlike US, Mexico never pandemic control experiencing especially bad surge right now. record 12,000 cases today, doesn’t sound like much Mexico notorious running enough tests. see 5 times less cases per capita US similar amount deaths per capita. Unless heads start falling, nothing going change. Correlation necessarily causation. hear ya There's people outside America? math bit off, 10x higher that.

2,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.002

0.002 * 100%=0.2%

Also, think understand that's 0.2% people New Jersey caught covid died, 0.2% total New Jersey population died.  America always first world country *on paper*  I'm part reddit call american I'd imagine reserve doses would mostly 2nd doses. Unless big batch first goes belly somewhere. Good idea pandemic I'm sure countries like uk getting sooner. tagged USA? kinda misleading  point wasn’t presidents skipping line, showing people works, like mega superstars could.

But mega sport superstars would also advantage able justify skipping list say showing people safe ""Just flu"" folks, 5x worst flu season last 10 years That's great news. people Brazil really suffered. 6k/day dead translates 1-2 million actual infected people? (Assuming 0.3-0.6% IFR)

If so, 'burn rate' 30-60 million people / month? Curious, anti-vaxers pull kids outta school? Can’t schools make getting Covid vaccine requirement? shorn’t. ""Get Hell Dodge.""  Yeah, I’m concerned 2nd shot won’t readily available happen specific time-line. don't. 100% confirm. Also crowd send kid school/therapy/daycare pumped full meds one realizes they're sick. get everyone else sick cycle repeats ad nauseum. Pretty sure it’s .2% ten times higher number dumbest take.

Counterpoint: coronavirus

(- less cars road, guess) wait side effects known willing take vaccine. Also wait vaccine options come available. care handling dirty rags, dealing washing etc. easier use paper towel throw trash. American way pro-virus, pro New York California. Indianapolis... brother works door dash reports restaurants packed everywhere tonight. one highest hospitalization rates country unhealthy population. I’m going keep family safe clearly wasting energy worrying community. bad Feds didn’t longer prepare vaccine distribution, guess. could predicted it? I’m aware happened. 

But really reason think would fail major way point game pretty reasonable anticipated rollout. 

 understand excess batches Pfizer “passed up” weren’t coming Q2? Yeah I’m going towards bottom list comes getting vaccine. wouldn’t mind moving million people. ironic ceo hospital laid really high keep like salary low. Highest bidder Trumps cult gathering DC weekend. easily see extra boost deaths that. Ski shit, man.  exactly apt comparison. gym, wish operate pandemic, wish flaunt reasonable rules minimize risk, would deserve sued hell back creating COVID hotbed. essential point laid redundancy don’t get complacent feel comfortable sorry man go fund support help legal fees? believe binge drinking hinder immune system somewhat. Yep. Americans majority got bored want pretend like everything fine. Plenty retarded nurses here.

It's hero-worship suggest otherwise. respect work do, 50% us average, try really hard keep dumb people industry.   US enough vaccine inoculate 3.2M people starting sometime next week. fastest could done 3 weeks (as takes two shots, 3 weeks apart). best hope us 3.2M people inoculated first week next year.

The reality need achieve 70% (+) saturation (or ~230M+) anything start change. also going take longer minimum timespan (shipping, medical coordination scheduling, well time make vaccine). unreasonable think take year, changes people made sticking around permanently. I’m new Reddit, I’ve posting frequently sub since March never found someone hoping speak of. Nobody fucking hopes stay home 2025, that’s anti-lockdown people think anyone recognizes reality virus wants. guys love say people advocating lockdowns love shit, it’s fucking true. 

So find *single* example that’d great. Yeah, headline giving Spaceballs vibes.

""I father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate."" could happens current vaccines. Time tell, I'm sure sensationalist media reddit posters take opportunity post ""150+ infections vaccinated prisoners"" something.  depends people disease not. asymptomatic, maybe protection. really hope (they asymptomatic). beyond ""not serious"" - covid 100% propaganda!

There 300 million species virus within right now. evolved alongside rely upon other.

Germ Theory - entire branch science says ""germs make sick vaccines provide immunity"" fraud created thief Pasteur, named pasteurization after.

Bechamp, hand, real science work contributed call Terrain Theory; says ""health begins gut complex ecosystem microorganisms within it.""

Don't get wrong, I'm financial support small businesses, need pandemic help brother out. Let alone fake pandemic designed get us hooked government handouts...

If look stats, actually LESS total deaths year 2018. yet panicked since black plague 700 years ago.

At point either hate want learn more! Let know comments 👇 Agreed. would never considered wearing mask grab groceries something sick before. I’m considering wearing crowded spaces flu season Oh, that's sad! deepest condolences loved ones! trail blazers. really liked songs. African American Country Singer still rarity day. heat spice coolness mint taste, chemicals messing temperature sensors tongue. 

The basic tastes tongue sweet, salt, bitter, sour umami. ""tastes"" actually smells. Covid affects sense smell. Get tested. all, died regardless whether shared beliefs, it’s tragedy. can’t call people selfish murderers wanting see family, also applaud belittle guys death

Yes die, seems like understand die himself, actions rallying people oppose lockdowns infringes personal freedom, caused death others may even rallies. article notes people rallies practice proper social distancing mask wearing. top leaders rally believe virus exists acting selfish reasons (can't wait couple months see families ) 90% ""right"" reasons (what exactly right reasons according you?), fact still stands putting reasons first overall health safety greater community. 

So shame trying shame community feeling bit resentment vindictiveness willingly put people's lives risk feeling personal freedom, financial strain, want see families can't wait months. know people's individual choices. People saying people losing businesses? Well know what, owning business risky. family owned businesses struggled it, industry anymore moved on. People choose wait respectfully patiently throw tantrum demand get want. innocent people infected died people's actions choice. deaths caused people's selfish actions. Yes people's pains relative choosing personal/ financial pain, actual death death others, less compassion first. This. throw stones businesses blatantly shitty like putting signs saying masks allowed inside won’t provide even base protections employees like social distancing, increased cleaning, whatever, expect businesses able provide employees proper PPE, hazard pay, work home options, close completely still paying people, federal government going help. states much money aren’t allowed go bankruptcy, states laws place require governor maintain balanced budget. unable run fiscal deficit way federal government is. 

Unfortunately, don’t great job teaching people government actually works, get people screaming governors providing stimulus such, don’t money so. Hell, average American doesn’t even know things like taxes tax brackets work. It’s lot easier get people riled screaming “opponents” poorly educated don’t understand things you’re telling take word it. know, made comment whole state individuals stunt apparently PG description considered 'uncivil' comment removed. Pfizer applying full FDA approval April understandable lot people hesitant first line vaccine. people get board rolled people see safe. bunch morons? Maybe thy shut business rather bring fined 10k per day?  going business owners mind right now.... Oh gotta sav business staying open creating public nightmare covid infection meanwhile government charging 10k per day GOTTA STAY OPEN. 

What fucking MORON able travel countries then. way need yellow fever shot go places. different   saying humans degenerate facing adversity? Talk doctor who's treating you.  included people current testing. 2 considerations:

* vaccine might unsafely activate immune system
* immunosuppressant medications might interfere vaccine’s effectiveness Thats apt comparison, all.

To get things back control, like many countries did, would simply support individuals small businesses 2-6 week period limited openness, reopen enforced mask mandates vaccines distributed enough become effective causing actual herd immunity rather wishful thinking Sweden tried. ability reopen fully constant unpredictable mishmash half-open markets would vastly valuable economically socially cost supporting struggling individuals temporary shutdown. probably end pass-fail, April.

Since I've around much already, really necessary completely isolate house away (adult) son? caught already, even though virus done running course her, studies show could still contract it? 

I've tried searching data suggests I'm fine, family ensure contact outside world isolation period passed, still risk within household virus spreading point? ............. stupid person thinking stupid thoughts. Plenty others selfishly thinking same. know that's relevant? saying excuse getting vaccine ridiculous, less severe ACTUAL COVID, continue remain risk vaccinate... 

I talking front line workers all, others refuse vaccine drag us. really sad part elected politicians could prepaired 5 month ago passed second stimulus bill. However, looks like leaders would rather see people suffer lose pride strongest empire world. words, GDP United States worth capita used provide number. ""Ready"" different tested manufactured. Even someone conceived using mRNA method data needed prepare dose vaccine then, usually takes years get market. scientific community, safety regulatory agencies, private companies got together condensed process, foregoing long-term follow-up favor emergency authorization benefit much higher risk midst. No,my classroom work in. special needs class,and always people day follow rules guidelines. Sorry 3 a.m. typed it. Oh okay, I'm really sorry.. everyone free analyze data share others tho win one you’ll redeploy 9/11 everyday baby! /s judgment imprisonment, death. words person whose income depends gyms open. Hmm ok [Everything odor day going medical checkup going like walking dog pound see one chooses you. ""Crap. Cancer dog would like word."" they'll isolate compounds dogs sniff make mechanical sensors thing. ""Crap. CancerBot beeping.""  Absolutely correct try watching CNN Town Hall vaccine last week. Dr Fauci said still going need mask however viral load lowered thanks vaccine. China’s campaign rewrite history COVID-19 using social traditional media scale never seen before. Stay informed. Seek credible news sources. Double-check stories. say this? one first scientists telling people aerosol borne virus. Perhaps misunderstood telling folk masks mean could carry usual. vaccine get, may ask? (Pfizer, Moderna?)

Were part study? single entity (such person) making choices spend money indeed microeconomics. Thank sharing experience (and work do). receive second vaccine? people want travel see loved ones oversees? It’s staying cooped bubble... neither requiring boarding pass go terminals airports. is. Minor changes result major events (negative, neutral posting) become normal. It’s life works. Normal constantly changing, there’s “new normal” normal whatever perceive be. Mask requirements popping going considered “normal” it’s extremely minor change pre covid lives. it’s still considered dangerous go bars concerts that’s “normal” it’s drastic change. adults still carry transmit disease even vaccine works don’t get sick it.

Source this? impression speculated current research way look changed transmission rates vaccinated vs placebo. I’m experiencing thing. Makes feel little nuts. played around risk smokers less someone smoke? know? 1594 suspected cases vaccinated group pfizers phase 3 3410 total cases suspected unconfirmed COVID-19 overall study population, 1594 occurred vaccine group vs. 1816 placebo group.** least think are. Great. Guarantee vaccine people use excuse socially distance adhere rules surrounding virus, passing onto many vaccine yet. Dude, I'm professional athlete. I've harmed directly gym closures. income depends lifestyle gym every day. I'm mature enough understand pandemic would made worse leaving gyms open normal. mean, gym refused even enforce masks. cant happen. part, athletes included. type covering mask hands going home cry afterwards? 

Impressive Flu season incredibly mild year. it’s misdiagnosis (for others room).  You’re assuming OP assuming. never said every doctor dropped everything covid. He’s saying everyone focusing covid would focused something else otherwise. Self-published authors submit journal, posted open access site. Like fan-fic bad science. one clever lads thinks influenza strictly upper respirator, unlike COVID cause organ failure, vascular thrombosis whatnot.

Here's CDC says flu Sinus ear infections examples moderate complications flu, pneumonia serious flu complication result either influenza virus infection alone co-infection flu virus bacteria. possible serious complications triggered flu include inflammation heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) muscle (myositis, rhabdomyolysis) tissues, multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory kidney failure). Flu virus infection respiratory tract trigger extreme inflammatory response body lead sepsis, body’s life-threatening response infection. Flu also make chronic medical problems worse. example, people asthma may experience asthma attacks flu, people chronic heart disease may experience worsening condition triggered flu.

Any sound familiar? 

Here are, quaking boots, think complications due COVID set apart run-of-the-mill bugs, don't. afraid realize risk horrible things happening flu cold bugs new. new you. first work deadly coronavirus disease vaccine started 2003. Quick action kept disease isolated China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore mostly. vaccine developed quarantining meant disease died spreading needed. dental conference city March considered one first super spreader events Canada. believe 40 direct cases linked don’t think they’ve figured many infections resulted, international convention.

We also big rugby tournament week, never heard cases directly related that.

This back March tho people taking seriously Yeah currently looks like one shot provide least 52% protection, likely 85%, assuming immune response keep elevating (they cannot measure people got second shot around time), cases number infections early scientists say certain. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

If runner well-controlled Type diabetes attacked bear morning run, trauma center difficult time stabilizing diabetes, ultimately resulting death -- died bear attack, diabetes. thumb pulse pandemic There's way we're getting vaccine soon

So one it? mean I'm doctor read news Well seeing lived Tuttle, Oklahoma five years think get talk shitty is

Why boner Oklahoma? got wheat fetish? comment disingenuous best. trying boil complex public health issues absolutism somebody buy simplistic narrative accuse going meltdowns. 

You seem idea data objective. thing is, data requires analysis, replete subjective interpretation. data objectively tells us one strategy among worst world, that's interpretation it. 

I could argue Sweden one best strategies world looking age-standardized all-cause mortality seeing among absolute lowest world. would supported data way statement supported confirmed covid19 deaths. Weird right? threw bunch food likely fine. tasted ""bad"" got cough/pink eye etc. every time something tastes bit me, get teen never know, don’t transparency first cases China really were. Regardless, a) first widespread outbreak certainly China, b) shouldn’t matter. New viruses happen, starting Italy would absolve China covering outbreak, starting China would absolve countries like US taking seriously soon enough. making cat people. publish it, I'm sorry Hmm maybe think deploying vaccine. Honestly... I've actually started looking self-defense techniques recently I'm prepared moment finally comes. I'd love nothing destroy somebody's face tried confront COVID/mask conspiracies. scared right term? I’m diabetic. react poorly seasonal flu catch it. I’ve taking precautions vs covid since early March. seems reasonable fear based. avoiding unnecessary trouble.
So would like facts untwisted government media. Fat chance, know Except we're winter Northern hemisphere UV light possible places. feel bad businesses. really catch 22. asking shut good reasons helping either. see countries Europe giving businesses 70% income previous year shut downs. Makes easier shut way. live US daily feeling. We're dying country dying people, nobody gives fuck. Whoa, that's wild consider. relief Corporations get juicy liability shield protect COVID related lawsuits employees! Mitch thirsty that! almost like sweat glands activate something foreign needs excreting...🙃

Hehe teasing ya yeah friend's head. Dogs smell fucking tumors forming though. Crazy shit. Seems like it’s priority let covid run wild places sake data experimentation. It’s sickening seen many people recently saying we're gonna living like years since vaccine came out. ones I've seen saying we'll still living like next months atleast given vaccine take time roll point majority us vaccinated. Like even though vaccine could wait till summer things return normality date study covering incubation period COVID19? i.e., day N exposure X% people show symptoms?

There study spring based mostly cases Asia covered January-February. I’ve seen cited multiple times (e.g., median 5 days). I’m trying find something updated, especially based US data.

Context: go dentist mask couple hours, region high case load. Obviously mask treatment. patients could COVID there’s risk room. Spouse wants isolate we’re trying figure long /u/slash196 nowhere found brutally fukt facts logic feel futile try reason people fully trump cult. Well I'll dumb monkey's uncle. possible imbalance suspected COVID-19

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  hurt give people false sense security, cause take unnecessary risks. UK daily tests something like 10x Japan's. surprised real number cases Japan upwards 30k growing. ICUS state full too, well hospital beds. hoping get point are. give strength hospital workers. can't even get bed hospital need one short term reason...

I've also heard calling students medicine help hospitals. really sad. Well, bright side, sounds (pre-pandemic) young people got fuck soon could. US, LA county alone like 13k cases day. It’s madness. LA County successfully sued shutting outdoor dining data support it. data. isn’t “following science”, it’s arbitrary optics politics. Arbitrarily closing people’s livelihoods isn’t helping cause either. Outdoor dining open since JUNE surges November.... coment wasnt political, mod. 

Christ.... village idiots always existed. Social media gave politicians tool influence without actually befriend them. well helping talk provide echo chamber gives false sense right. 

A programmed idiot weapon. That's is. 

The movies always made think would programmed smart person, makes sense would actually program easiest fool. No... I’m downvoting bad information dude. vaccines doses, Pfizer news changes nothing timelines already laid out. Like said, warp speed said vaccinate 100 million end February. Moderna’s vaccine coming ton doses. Pfizer news says we’ll able use 100 million doses now, huge concern considering Moderna + J&amp;J gets approved OTW. again, trusting public health officials here. think context everything. time Osterholm probably reacting whole everyone wore cloth face mask carry usual, cloth masks adequate protection frontline healthcare workers. can't, not! NIOSH ratings PPEs reason. gives us probability exposure given exposure time.  certain activities exposure times, N95 useless. mean anything, means end result wearing one. Disagree facts? UK also higher population even criticise government well. still get point. government handled covid poorly means can't criticise countries well? Italy also handled covid poorly tbh. Deaths per capita Italy UK similar I'd hardly say Italy excused. also drrw comparisons Germany who've handled far better Italy UK people literally think virus exist, that's false positives. long ago article ICUs States treating critically ill patients still thought virus hoax. coming from? 

Well, noticed certain Dr. Michael Yeadon (who also falsely claimed Pfizer/BionTech vaccine make women infertile) popular among lateral thinkers Germany, claims pandemic COVID-19 infections false positive one dying COVID-19. makes confused guy used head allergy respiratory research Pfizer, 11 years ago.

There's video YouTube, 110,000 views, making claims interview German independent news, OVALmedia. course video wildly popular echo chamber.

It stage starting sound lot like HIV/AIDS denialism. Poor babies :( Cool guess three 9/11s worth people die daily local gym stay open! also put blame Fox News. They’ve spent last 15+ years perfecting art exaggerating fabricating getting whole group people primed accept whatever say little critical thinking need concrete evidence. think could possibly believe X already believe - W, therefore X isn’t remotely far fetched. AZ would last place would thought reach high numbers....But again, California draining years droves moving Texas, guess makes sense

Plus damn dry there. love Arizona! Well see bunch PAers coming weeks. told mom (they live NJ) everyone gathering yesterday we're basically closing much possible January 4th. thought PA pass budget 🤦🏾‍♀️. Gallon jugs, long bar. Ez weights pinch bro lol Respect science agrees opinion, otherwise disregard science dog paid special attention one friend's balls. give moment's peace. got really embarrassing tiresome. Turned testicular cancer. Employed here. going CDC numbers info. Unfortunately MSM doesn’t. 

I say let open. 
Yes yes motherfucker. recommendations put place like 6ft distance wear mask aren’t intended 100% protective getting virus, decrease likelihood getting infected ultimately reduce transmission rate (R-value), ideally kept 1. 

A lot articles point stuff like beyond counterproductive. lot people longer even try keep even 6ft distance since “doesn’t work anyways”. 

We saw similar issue early rapid testing, lot articles “rapid tests miss 50% cases”, without providing context. ultimately delayed roll rapid testing months still people won’t get tested they’re “not accurate anyways.” live North Carolina. 

Some us decent smart folk... 

Then cultists.... Efficiency store energy, wavelengths able absorb. I’ve personally slept car didn’t want drink drive. Doesn’t mean want sleep car every night indefinitely. wat new normal crew ain’t giving up. Proud guys, keep it’s family owned business fucking bullshit. ""Formaldehyde metabolism"" search string yields lots results. toxin damage DNA. However, cells two lines defence danger formaldehyde. Firstly, enzyme converts formaldehyde less dangerous chemical, called formate. secondly, DNA damage caused formaldehyde fixed DNA repair enzymes.

Note ""formate"" smell crush ant. Human noses sensitive formaldehyde related metabolites.  Hard disagree. people prison petty crimes like food theft, small possession charges marijuana, even innocent people took plea deal due lack funds good lawyer prove innocence. Oddly enough prisons full murderers rapists. There's lot stupid reasons put people prison country, highest inmate per capita ratio next fucking china. honestly believe every single person deserves painful death via covid? guess immunity harm correct wait data actual transmission. 

The point way two stage vaccines work, one included, first shot confer short term immunity second confer long term immunity. don’t gain greater resistance virus second dose. gain longer lasting resistance. 

After receiving first inoculation safe going get. read Mark Meadows told FDA head get done Friday look another job. That's probably worst thing could happened approval process. got approved Trump administration tainted approval might backfire. Yes, sunlight, ocean air beaches super spreaders. /s  Sort glad got laid lol Owner favorite restaurant died yesterday right post, interview Dont worry, 1 month heckin coolio president biden get office news tell everything OK covid-19 over. example option a) get drunk b) get drunk outside home c) get drunk outside without friends take home. Whereas business one option shut zero alternatives assistance. analogy doesn’t make much sense here. Plants theoretical maximum efficiency 30% specific wave lengts. Plants utilize fraction wave lenghts, absorb light. efficiency maxes ar 3 - 6 %.

Even current cheap solar panels beat plants fotosyntethic microbes efficiency. 
The world record solar cell efficiency 47.1%.


However, sure close beating dogs nose, artificial one. Neural network coupled super sensitive molecular detector - thats dog already - need train detect covid. even need know molecules dogs draw conclusion positive detection. Merry Christmas! insane capitalistic traditions actually killing us! would done differently, given Sweden’s system regional/national governance, legal system state disaster prep? people too.  It’s astonishing point people still oblivious cause effect. almost calculate spikes week. late august told boss Midwest see exponential growth around Election Day peaking maybe weeks later Pittsburgh burbs (where live) would mess Christmas.  Well ho ho ho.  are.  Almost week. happens people multiple jobs then? distance everything work jobs well, people need money pay bills. Thank this. small business shut 2 months, burns hear people get paid work home harping shutdowns. showed people really handle danger rationally all, maybe we're usually quite disconnected life-threatening situations modern society. thing killed people clearly visible gruesome way like Ebola bet people saying nothing would've first run hills. punching face something provoke emotional response, convince really thing, regardless dangerous consider information there. think problem gyms work exhale air heavy breathing. People want wear masks working want oxygen. probably need things spaced 6 feet. probably open till basically mess nothing really open. wife ICU nurse.

What breaking spirit patients, seeing disregard extended-family, friends neighbors public health guidelines. 

She feel betrayed society. Update: condolences internet stranger friend. I'll 38 spring, also two young kids. lost uncle July. Lol Im going bet COVID dolls souvenirs sold over, already. become part cultural zeitgeist. bail failing businesses believe businesses big fail. Well that’s unfortunate, feel compelled downvote good information seem stuck bad information... vaccinate 100M February we’d need 200M vaccine doses. 40M doses end year won’t get another 80M doses summer you’re MPH program know better! “Our elections rigged want take drug put together 7 months!” GOP gunna convince base trust refuse believe anything real? Republican Party literally dies off? Pretty shocked see amount people saying everyone vaccinated they'll stop wearing mask. vaccine 100% effective, masks absolutely stay mandated stores indoor centres. Lol yeah majority drivers shotgun, he/she gets practice dropkicks too. Totally agree. mean still agree shut needed we've also got provide financial assistance places. we're asking people put livelihoods line. can't even begin imagine financial pressure businesses must facing pandemic Spanish Flu. think needs source. Since sounds illegal.  Given press, it’s unexpected. I'm familiar gentleman. What's record like? quite nut job?

I probably Google guy. frustrating wasn’t way funding, could’ve actually handle virus people wouldn’t lose everything. Restaurants bars second leading place people contract COVID (after indoor gatherings homes) think funds close keep paying rent, employees etc COVID numbers might look different. thats one many categories could’ve looked different, leadership, funding planning sorely lacked book amazing subject. There's many more, enzymes work quantum mechanics entirely life Yes imagine would end quickly....It taper off, logically. homeless people Berkeley different breed ones SF. Berkeley homeless polite. use run every morning hills uc back San Pablo. winters I'd toss hand warmers homeless people. Used buy huge box hand warmers pass out. many questions...
Are re-infected individuals immunocompromised? Could reinfection different strain? 

Acknowledging US less stellar track record prisoner experiments, need analyze &amp; understand what’s going on. supply real bottleneck Australia, approval. they're expecting delivery Pfizer doses March anyway, there's less rush approve compared countries secured doses faster timeline. course, extremely low infection levels make less pressing issue North America Europe. Fun part father still wants stuff. touch dementia, get spread serious disease. Pfizer system think. studies raw data showing gyms superspreaders? [In NYC they're responsible 0.06% gym hold refuse pay it'll forgiven."
