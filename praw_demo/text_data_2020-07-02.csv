I‚Äôm hoping people watching whichever companies stocks carefully. put reports every month word bankruptcy keeps getting brought reports companies alternative stock maybe good idea. Hmmm went you. Wonder hahah ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt support issuing statewide mask mandate,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs hugely overly burdensome government tell people cannot wear face leave house.‚Äù

Ok. First, get rid mandate says need cover pee-pee I'm walking around front yard. absolutely reason regulate cannot wear crotch I'm darn property dancing front people walking -- except makes people _feel uncomfortable_ seeing random naked dude dancing. public health benefit. disease. collapsed healthcare system. collapsed economy.

In contrast, mask helps keep us collapsing healthcare system economy.  10,000+ cases Florida alone. Welcome sunshine state! find here, USA Canada. people usually see without masks often less fortunate impoverished. Yeah, live alone. sanitized anything. disposable surgical masks (n95s hard get) going shopping / transit. wash hands whenever come home. probably laundry WFH one sees so. Test means everything!!! Universal theme parks open That‚Äôs right. reached 100k March 27, May 27. still month widespread infections started detected US, sure. Seeing i've actually heard people say ""I know anyone, fake news saying people get it."" people believe someone care gets it, bad.  Again, cases 40. IFR .009%. That's 90 1 million people. much sub admit Cos worship him. Fauci made mistakes: like anyone position probably would. Lying public wrong thing here. should‚Äôve advised wear face coverings masks, government ban sale actual masks etc Swedish people follow rules. problem followed broken rules. first thought. 

If Trump, would‚Äôve hopped second. Even though hate whole MAGA thing, would jump joy Absolutely blows mind this. Clearly Americans continue flaunt advice deny medical experts need wake smell coffee. 10k one state insane, even mention states problems. 5 new cases country although facemasks stores set become mandatory, among measures already place, hopeful wider opening return 'normality'. 

I truly feel US following advice hope foolish actions others impact families. No. Pretty obvious point Read table one actual study

notice age discrepancies groups

Put study file thirteen It‚Äôs new study today. Imagine sad medicine helped people. No. people live issues rest lives people die 50 times over. Medical Bill's destroy hundreds thousands lives too. guys movie theatres ??? remember back day I‚Äôd go  Reportedly first words ‚Äúoh, F**k this.‚Äù expect high.

At first thought conditions, one clearly statement.... don‚Äôt call gods waiting room nothing. It‚Äôs really fucking old shit hole. Go ahead. 

Posting articles Places like worse posting all. will, climbing southern states virus raging now. Hopefully fatality rate lower seem better job treatment, since raw numbers infected crazy high hospitals inevitably max out, thats going hold. expect see US deaths multiple thousands per day range later month sadly. ones wearing masks here. live lower income area Charlotte never see anyone wearing masks stores. Even though signs everywhere.

People seem ADD wear mask couple days, see anything happening go back mask life. Supply chains going shit, micro explosions covid everywhere long starts hitting home lot us.

This life now, get used it. mask better nothing wear stay home fucks sake. 7-day average daily cases GA going every day since least June 15th.

The lag peak cases (7d avg) peak deaths (7d avg) April one saying agree real life data. always chance could error, and/or viral count lower. I‚Äôd suggest careful try go work. also shouldn‚Äôt symptoms (despite testing negative) valid reason go in? It‚Äôs thing Canada. Still lower mid May don‚Äôt get free govt money quit. Today terrible day. [I've plotting daily change 7-day rolling average new last days looked like forming peak plateau. positive sign, although would keep breaking records, least increase stopped increasing.

However today puts back linear growth change translates exponential growth total cases.

I think last days reduced low test numbers Florida. that's people dont lie ass talk 100% proven. Yeeeee... awww... Yes, 1-2 months meaning anywhere within time frame. 2 months passes death rate stays would start confident death rate stabilized. Yeah, they're undertesting based positive percentage ~15% still. don‚Äôt know. 

Do live hotspot? Sounds like two coworkers family members tested positive.

I think last days reduced low test numbers Florida. Reminds people used [pox way all. Florida? It‚Äôs nearly dense NY. Need rubber bullets tear gas thugs Worse, women pressured prove primary caregiver assumption are. Men be. stonks keep going up! Deaths gonna go high soon 12% worse day. Seems fine. really still clinging I'm ready leave sub lol. Let idiots circle jerk together USA!USA!USA! Oh no. take care lung transplants. Sometimes fucking brutal. worth fight make side like organ transplants. hope he's one lucky ones get relatively ok. big! Please wear mask would get tested? ""It's cold."" 687 deaths. it! lowered ... pandemic deaths?  come week ago matter?. warned?

Edit: hope free masks give say ""Sanders 2020"" them. don‚Äôt even care themselves, would require little bit thinking realize. America CDC Surgeon General - enough? friends coworker symptoms. idea said went test cause thought it. Dude. Quit. life lives loved ones worth it. cant believe places business shut down.

Ppl im Texas talking relocating northeast. üò¨ expect everyone moved south come back soon? order procedure, actually need interrupt ventilator. Given bad lungs sound, I'd imagine oxygen saturation would drop quite low time. 

Also, drowning sensation comes lack breathing... accidentally chug water fast goes wrong way, end coughing gagging airway reflexes. imagine several bottles water process may last hour more. 

Unsedated patients ventilators still reflexes, hence comment sedated procedure. Ok. anyone else complete/productive answer?  Doubt holidays? Yes! Many are. Others younger without career families. central Illinois never find enough even do, even debating quality ed giving kids without small group/individual instruction ton subs. districts rolled dice spend time money planning remote learning even though high probability year point. Oh boy, thread civil Immunity! Muted strains would still close enough vaccine remain effective. Miami resident here, partially losing sense taste, would surprised it. Dont take virus game, wear mask social distance. goal. physics major asks, ‚Äúwhy work?‚Äù

I've problem wrong. I'm wrong quite bit. Figuring truth much important right. 

What  BR SYMPTOMATIC mean? Gotcha, thanks! filter pocket needed there's filter? buy filter separately somewhere add mask? trying compare something holocaust? think may forgotten take meds, could also simply mean virus circulating actively population. October going boomer teacher massacre. Thousands, tens thousands old teachers going die.

The average teacher age district close 55. Something like 40% district's teachers ""high risk"" categories. Lots cancer survivors, lots old people, lot medical concern.

And we're going put rooms 30 40 kids.

So, anyways, lot open sub positions, especially year-long ""leave"" replacements. lots teacher funerals. sad! Exactly!! people make sound like super strict wasn‚Äôt. California thought relatively strict lockdown US, still saw people post hanging every day. Without enforcement, individuals everyone followed wish teachers would looked experts classroom. Doctors experts field, CLUE goes classroom, clearly. 85% hospital beds spoken for, 88% ICU beds spoken for

Doesn't essentially mean full already start triage? doubt hospital beds people evenly distributed enough still 12% capacity. think fact Paul Romer many well regarded economists argued best move economy bring pandemic end shows fighting covid helping economy mutually exclusive. Opening economy bandaid economy. Covid isnt going anywhere demand isnt going improve either. Worse yet, opening businesses hurting workforce. Gues rolling... Image what‚Äôs going happen 2-3 weeks 4th. Dr.Rob: fail mention that, states ixnay'd 'vaccine posses' judges said ""Violation Constitutional Rights... cut bleep out!"" weird, lot people coronavirus subs really fearmongering. Calling someone fearmonger point catastrophically rising case levels call mask mandates dumb. say shit like ""I hope us even [insert amount time] [insert something do]""? Yeah, that's fucking fear mongering. 

There's nothing even resembling consensus whether get lasting immunity recovering virus. Stop saying (I realize nobody ITT said that, even first guy, dbags might reading this). take vaccine that's rushed year. ebola, yes, mild disease like this.  I've work sick ONE take class. we've double classes many times can't find subs. nightmare. pre-pandemic!  runoffs. actual November ballot stuff yet. start talk secondary effects lockdown (suicides, substance abuse, etc) without called conspiracy theorists? 

***I would literally rather die live lockdown perpetuity that's important feeling express.***

Hell, here's actual peer-reviewed research indicating lockdowns caused deaths Austria blockading routine medical procedures died COVID. 

Why feel can't actual discussion like rational adults? I'm denying.. talking scammers. Wish nation wide... I‚Äôm New Hampshire say cases nowhere near Texas but, officially opened cases slowly rising... popular state staters camping outdoor activities. mountian bike park opened MANY people come state, he‚Äôll even different countries I‚Äôm sure! It‚Äôs interesting time. Putting politics ahead science... it‚Äôs just... right. lie say wish everything wasn‚Äôt open? No. gone small things but, many people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. Hasn‚Äôt proven wear mask literally stop second wave? I‚Äôm push masks can‚Äôt without social distancing well. It‚Äôs really frustrating people can‚Äôt follow rules especially given fact done zero risk. MI saying (build wall) OH ages. I'm sorry dad. know necessarily narcissism. Americans gotten extremely good dividing small groups designating others think like ""bad"". bad things happening bad people? One gives less shit. Bad people need go punished anyway. Bad things happening one own? Suddenly give shits.

Wish knew expand people's ""one own"" mean ""humans"", there's easy answer that.

Authoritarianism cancer. may case years ago, teacher shortage new teachers snatched quick. subs pretty old. Close gyms! live üôÉ know people Imperial go San Diego every weekend (or pandemic).

Please wake hoax. wot? [236 people got coronavirus Oregon church held services lockdown ‚Äî evidence religious gatherings superspreading hot Multiple countries opened school restrictions virus seems less transmittable young people (especially 12). seem get less easily, fewer symptoms transmit fewer people do. least, governments say (the Netherlands example). 

I add least Netherlands schools open way yet, part-time. Also, could see spreading virus US students much higher obesity rate, know works like that. perpetuate lies. However bad say is, bank actually worse. newer schools even opening windows. I'm lucky, window opens, teeny tiny window little air movement, place able put fan plug anything. (Plus, I'm sure moving air around room help?) 

In August, freaking hot humid can't even normal outside recess. schedule 30 minutes kids recess, August MISERABLE there. stay notice kids clustered together shade playground, panting heat. miserable hot magical 2 week window early October, miserable cold rest year. Joys central US. right can't make shit Grand Canyon fit lot heads too. cri evrytiem  (very few) legitimately trouble wearing mask face shields, excuses Hey hey hey. include florida too? say mess. must give credit credit due...! 5 tests resulted false negative we're far testing bare minimum. susceptible people nation tested weekly basis. showing symptoms COVID, even presented negative test result, continue self-quarantine.

That's original statement commented on, thought another user continuing discussion. signify talking nursing home patients? Because, I'll repeat, painting really broad brush.

Because majority COVID patients died within facilities perform extensive amount testing staff patients/residents. individuals statistically higher chance infection death. really need medical staff due prolonged shortages almost every field. think reasons we've triaged testing, none currently inept government malicious intent. even question, statement. I'm surrounded high risk people never tested never wear masks. Nothing say changes irrefutable fact. fact, sir. kind turns talking head. need answer question I'll find appropriate outlet.

So reasons. individuals experiencing COVID symptoms? might getting tested unless infection rates low enough contact tracing effective. might tested comorbidities (pre-existing conditions). really depends numbers, local health departments, state/facility guidelines. Patients generally asked monitor symptoms home case they're infected tested admitted symptoms worsen. patient tested results usually available around time infection apparent. already assume patients symptoms COVID+. nation enough tests March enough people perform on. believe plays factor well newer rapid tests recently granted FDA approvals. feel much comfortable 1-5% false negative rate (rates failure IMO) current 20%. 

As see several factors play role testing. works one region might work another. Hopefully new rapid tests higher accuracy rate detecting COVID earlier.

And feel bad local idiots. state issued mandatory mask order couple people laughing gas station made national headlines. noticeable employee badge seen. really need legalize marijuana hybrid paranoia pain relief. need answer question I'll find appropriate outlet.

Check local health department, local governments, state government, state health department, 2-1-1, CMS, CDC. great resources. end feel believe best you. Full disclosure, I'm medical provider working six personal taxonomy codes. I'm region I'm inappropriate outlet. Logic! anymore ever. Teenagers never given shit think ""chaos"" explains though: many US states went thorough shutdowns masks everything.. Yet, curve never went anywhere near zero. [236 people got coronavirus Oregon church held services lockdown ‚Äî evidence religious gatherings superspreading hot want remind everyone 2-3 week lag cases reported deaths don‚Äôt think deaths falling safe. might end seeing lower death rate back April think it‚Äôs severely undercounted number infected back April. Lmao arrogance. species fine, Americas fester widespread infections own. That's two oceans side for, keep infected away. use snapchat filters meetings. uncivil. \*side-eye puppet meme\*

But I've staying home, washing hands lot,band wearing mask times go out. lumped them? Lol Western Germany mate. literal Corona parties middle outbreak city. guess right. I‚Äôm shocked many churches holding services. shouldn‚Äôt be, live Republican Bible Belt Texas, damn y‚Äôall really aren‚Äôt loving neighbors attending in-person services.

They‚Äôre clear right loving neighbors means staying F away them. understand that. understand how, case virus spreading regardless piece dirt live on, 1 ""nation"" inside another dictate policy regarding health issue inside place traveled freely. test. I've heard higher chance false negative swab deep nose like doctor. deep could, hopefully results soon. Good Sorry don‚Äôt get joke? Darwinited States One popular, serious reputable news anchor Mexico made comment one night people might well ignore health secretary data recommendations, apparently order pushed network's owner one richest people Mexico, counter government calling lines businesses non-essential, whole country went crazy social media night, anchor ended issuing apology next day saying people follow health guidelines. damage done, many people believed him, spike cases following days incident also helped give momentum huge wave skeptic people questioning validity data anchor suggested.


So yeah, media proven cause lot harm easily situation we're living. It‚Äôs bad enough people familiar one worked good ‚Äúwhat it‚Äôs like rona‚Äù jokes around news depends actions country times. virus become dangerous time, i.e. R 1 now, also 1 later level mitigation remains same. 

A second wave magically evolve. factors (unchecked reopenings) cause R grow significantly 1 time. far tell, Iran USA produced second waves. Ice melted. specify Easter, checkmate. completely agree! partial lockdown didn‚Äôt help much full lockdown would‚Äôve, people got tired started ignoring Holy crap forgot ""normal Easter"" thing. feels like lifetimes ago. feeling there's going whole lot ""first violation""s. also don‚Äôt wear/never wore masks outside public transport.

Mainly jewish students getting accepted simply better test scores gpa. UCLA decided use less objective measurements like SAT/ACt instead use subjective measurements like extracurriuclar essays.

That's partly BS colleges say ""demonstrated leadership skills"" important. fun fellow Americans. I'm fucking terrified authoritarian bent otherwise reasonable individuals name biosecurity. 

Public health experts saying clearly simply pandemic cost exponentially lives without pretty basic precautions. isn‚Äôt big conspiracy. can‚Äôt ignore reality it‚Äôs inconvenient principles.

The people decrying lockdowns different opposed mask Spanish Flu.

At least honest now. Even Illinois starting schools info test is? would like one. like Day Tomorrow.

You also climate polarisation, mistrust disinformation caused proliferation digital technology de-regulation allowing anyone compete attention audience message reach.

You know pandemic imminent. weeks crisis mode, got sparse research data, lot frantic video calls within health community get things going. Everything reflected till theoretic. Suddenly reality, reality still different experience. drill.

So. find front camera, thousands questions, eyes imminent threat supply chains breaking, images empty grocery stores dwindling supply medical equipment. rough numbers nobody tell things pan next days weeks. Yet everyone expects know clings lips exact answers.

So. said, would said? Serious serious question: would straight forward this? Tell there's pandemic bad idea. Tell want get people sick want get sick yourselves. not? Thanks, u/deirdresm. I'm sorry illness family gone thru I'm sorry cat. enough.   Yeah idk twitter facebook feed toxic misinformed masks particularly. sad.

Jails best way spread virus even more. like they're contact outside world. virus spreads like wildfire jail, guards administrators go home spread friends on. could place 99% inmates home arrest right except super dangerous ones, would best way go. I'm even talking happens jail inmates realise they're basically inside gigantic petri dish there's way out. understand it‚Äôs anecdotal right? Holy shit that's lot even scarier compared countries like Italy, daily peak 6.5k 60+ million people country, Florida 10k bit 20 million people...

I feel sorry smart american people respectful prevention rules. important questions... sub bunch Reddits people don‚Äôt like masks try get echo chamber.

Meanwhile, CSU schools (California State University), state system here, already said fall semester online couple months back. Easy solution: Stop admitting covid patient 60 years old.

**The coronavirus put Sweden's healthcare sector strain requiring reorganisation delays cancellation routine care. Even potentially life-saving procedures affected, sharp fall number organ transplants.**

**""It's serious patients risk dying they're waiting list,""** Johan Nilsson, professor thoracic surgery Sk√•ne's University Hospital, told TT newswire.

Tens thousands operations cancelled Sweden order allow healthcare sector cope high numbers seriously ill coronavirus patients. investigation Swedish radio shows average waiting time planned operations increased three months since start outbreak.
Many cancelled procedures routine low-risk, even transplants essential organs affected.

According Swedish Transplant Association, 21 percent reduction organ donors spring, compared average period past three years.
 
""To me, surprising fall quite large. see decline thoracic surgery, almost 50 percent,"" said Nilsson, also spokesperson association. Thoracic surgery relates organs chest, often heart lungs.

**""I speculate, likely explanation situation intensive care strained pandemic. access resources needed, means people choose go potential donors**,"" Nilsson explained.

**Lung transplants fallen 58 percent, heart transplants 38 percent, kidney transplants 30 percent liver transplants 10 percent, according figures.**

Last year, 812 organ transplants Sweden, including transplants living deceased donors, according non-profit Mer Organdonation (Mod). 

The enormous pressure intensive care spring -- required doubling capacity nationwide -- may made harder devote time resources carrying transplants would possible.

""It meant available capacity us manage organ donations take care donors probably de-prioritised,"" said Lars Wennberg, doctor transplant clinic Karolinska University Hospital. ""Rightly wrongly, know. Sadly, course, that's happens tough situation.""

**Nilsson says increase intensive care beds focused Covid-19 patients, department actually ended fewer available places.** 

""They principle increase number intensive care places [for non-coronavirus patients]. thoracic intensive care fewer places, since moved general surgery cancer surgery could carried out,"" explained.
Even coronavirus outbreak, Sweden shortage organs transplants; April need 859 organs. 

The shortage mean patients wait longer transplant carried out, put risk.

**""It's clear effect transplant wait. thoracic patients, already harder find suitable organs. longer waiting time means increased risk dying waiting list,""** said Nilsson. 

Now Swedish authorities believe country passed peak outbreak, number coronavirus patients intensive care steadily falling lower number non-coronavirus patients. healthcare sector works return normal situation, there's still worry ahead summer autumn.

""We still waiting return normal situation comes organ transplants deceased donors. still many,"" said Lars Wennberg.

Personally like odds vaccine better. Next thing know, Mexicans start arresting illegal immigrants coming America, putting cages, sending back USA. President Mexico also said wall would built, America pay it, and, unlike Trump, right. India guarantee leading way test near,y enough people India slums never get tested  poorest people see - wear masks. see Europe effective lockdown measures mask wearing China's lockdown measures lot strict Europe absolutely every single person wearing mask. even went far using tooth picks press buttons elevators things like that. obviously numbers China provided (and probably still are) wrong, doubt strict measures big effect slowed spread small numbers.

Since June started, we've anywhere 100 new cases 500 max, usually 250s. really exponential growth. idea: vaccine ready, restrict it. Say USA get it. Say nurses politicians only. Make conspiracy nuts demand access it. Oh they?

So hate Norway, Denmark, Finland?


Those nations praised Sub.


No masks.


Or sub praises Austria mask mandate.


It rescinded month ago.


OUCH. think Sweden‚Äôs going best lasts 3 years slippery slope argument making people get vaccinated COVID means implant tracking chips people something nonsense. Yes get necessary vaccination.

Anyway, important vaccines essentially mandatory children, varying degrees, US states. states getting vaccinated requires exemption mandate, particularly school attendance, varying bases exemptions depending state. COVID vaccine along lines, adults included, would line process every bit important. hell time looking up, found Moderna vaccine high percentage severe reactions. think communities want defund police, try experience happens police. 

Sometimes best way learn something turn bit. emperor dies probably. UC San Diego Boston University researchers able block 90% cell infections vitro using nanoparticles sheathed receptors COVID uses invade human cells. Roach motels viruses, effect. go in, come out.

Not likely make much difference, ask me, given length clinical pipeline. technology techniques could prove invaluable confront next pandemic. smart best bet dying disease. Always been. feeling hotels really don‚Äôt clean thoroughly (especially blankets comforters). physical presence necessary? probably make work home anyway SLO. comes timezone issue working late afternoon deep night?  friend told family high risk going take vaccine releases might cause get sick die. true that? There‚Äôs data 1918 jurisdictions took stronger public health measures fastest economic recovery. I‚Äôve saying months many people saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs big deal‚Äù listen. Funny enough Canada prediction ‚Äúpeople say overblown take proper measures‚Äù 100% true. made judge jury? even coronavirus wants england right isnt. let's honest trace things minimum sending home entire classroom.

Because commute bigger cities, use gas stations public facilities, encounter people do.

You're helping case.

My solution addresses all. not. Maybe ""just around corner"" effect play. Maybe people think coronavirus situation soon go away waiting. becomes tempting keep economy running well. ""May"" = Yes. said public need mask. wait areas cases. increase lockdown. Three weeks open dining decrease total cases. believe 5 regions NY state phase 4 excellently. never cancelled, switch banks, way keep charging me. never tried contact me.

So can't 300k want gather celebrate? need mask social distancing irrelevant, can't people go outside celebrate? Agreed. 1 year old bloody nose, 3 year old daughter cried 10 minutes shows fear wherever even mention it. triggered damn gag reflex deep. basically stab brain There's 2 results head right 1st one vaccine works fine finally able get back normal, 2nd one turns person zombie.

God, glad parents immigrated Canada states know 14 yo kid Internet wilds? Agreed 100%. thought this, too. Seems new strain aggressive well. people fail realize even someone asymptomatic... virus 15 20% damage major organs lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, gall bladder, brain. weakening immune systems making people susceptible everything common cold pneumonia.

I'm sorry we're pandemic. capable making life saving decisions appoint someone capable.

The virus care ""good governor feels conflicted"" neither anyone else.

Until virus over. protesting anything. Safety first  law, technically essential Thanks! I'll check out.. bought two boxes want use them. Interesting. want one vaccine vaccinate them?

It discount indications benefits using drug certain people certain conditions. far panacea everyone wants be. major issues methodology study (I believe quote article along lines researchers ""loosey-goosey"").  
 
And discount earlier studies showed benefit drug, even adverse effects (like significant increase heart issues). short, one study significant problems discounted entirely, research needed anyone start crowing drug's success.

America become worlds strongest superpower?

We spent 100 years importing everyone moxie ambition Europe. SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV2 beta coronavirus' similar. Genomic comparison SARS SARS-CoV-2 shown 380 amino acid substitutions SARS-CoV-2 SARS-like coronaviruses, mostly concentrated non-structural protein genes protests people literally wore masks complained overdue haircut. 

Those protests caused little outbreaks either, people still ready accept reality COVID spreads. still people complaining beachgoers, Pete's sake. Herd immunity definitely reachable quite quickly, within months given massive rate spread virus unchecked. imagine problem disease's mortality would shoot roof. There's absolutely way hospitalize tens millions people once, yet least 1 20 people die get hospital care. Also healthcare general (not Covid19) would collapse months. top percentage survivors need care post-covid conditions, might strain healthcare systems leading reduced life expectancy also population large.

It's much better people wear face masks practice social distancing, even eradicate disease keep spread manageable level vaccines available. wealthy enough charter private jet lives far rules applied them. possibly first time money useless get want. hold breath yet use clout get peons turned away fired jobs Hurry! people right best available intelligence pandemic, best sources candor, regardless governors' officials' decisions.

a lot individual Americans care. face masks, partying clubs, house parties. people start caring, continue run rampant. People where? Certainly live. guess hoping awareness flu season would help that. Bunch utter morons. think point valid, continue analogy, can‚Äôt bathe x-rays surprised develop cancer. 

The self-reinforcing echo chamber, algorithms optimized reinforce confirmation bias, complete lack liability spread misinformation makes inherent problems worse. World warcraft already pandemic, Corrupted blood, affected 1.2 million players across hundreds servers. almost exact coronavirus, wealthy high level people affected except little annoyance losing health could regain, low level players would killed it, wealthy players populated areas could leave, spread virus areas low level players stay die.

People even went far purposely spread virus like seeing today, others like nurses trying heal players also putting harm's way.


It huge blizzard even got emails CDC asking data, tried study Trump abdicated leadership pandemic. corrupt hell economy gutter ... One thing I've noticed initial reports coming China, runny nose uncommon (less 5%), online frequently reported symptom now. Wonder D614G strain causes runny nose, original one usually didn't. Would make sense would significantly increase infectiousness. Schaub actually fans? Eh, I'm friends idiots. 

Social networks major benefit me, great way stay touch friends, colleagues, family, etc. lives got busier people moved away. F significant number Americans think rules apply them? know spoiled entitled, even so... say effect said studies proving effectiveness, agree.

Your argument imho I'm surprised, death pandemic issue young. Boomers mostly 60s point. Indications recent surge far concentrated younger individuals. 20-40 year olds seem driving spike late. see, functional government educated populace Denmark. tends allow tough problems solved reasonably quickly efficiently. wish here...

This reported, likely it‚Äôs inexpensive easy produce one super dangerous. Yeah USA hit peak sometime 90s. It‚Äôs hill since 2000 election it‚Äôs never getting better current government systems. There's bascially downside wearing mask, mild discomfort, there's chance widespread mask use public might significantly contribute lowering transmission rates; low-risk, high-reward counter measure, adopted without issue.

You jackshit. take credit people's work, delusional moron. Regardless, business telling countries accommodate you. Italy could enforce rules UK Russia. USA special think ""we saved asses..."". Typical obnoxious American. first wave. still got two go. true winner wins best two three. I'm really interested strategies U.S. Brazil come remain competitive moving forward first wave over.

Even imperfect information better none. fact South Koreans getting new mask every week (distributed pharmacies) makes us look pitiful.
The world health organization thought would tell us masks help would buy masks could go hospitals needed more. Unfortunately, untruths designed manipulate people behaving well often end going bad road.

If one wants money going good cause, they're better giving well-vetted charity government. New York 31k dead. south done much better north point. Look net Jersey 15k dead. Texas? 2566 deaths. Florida? 3683. people compare devastation north south absolute bs understanding tested weekly. Had. brightest minds beat scientists, second world war. lifted straight Germany.

Then again, I'm moron so....what know.  dont see everyone overseas shitting Americans. lot us taking covid serious since January. old ‚Äúthrow baby bath water‚Äù. takes one ass get 30 people sick. think shooting fireworks assholes spiting others mouths dont care look us people, rootin tootin yeehawin cowboys right? wild watching people write 328 million people.

Man, that's actually really depressing. probably right internet simply amplified voices - bad good ones. know. massive protests Chicago, NYC, DC. massive outbreaks. outbreaks consistently follow opening plans, protests. Media helping. lot us part media keeps saying ""y'all fucked "" long causes ppl say fuck it. think cheer ppl marathon? Even ones running 15 minute miles feel good keep going. tell person crappy time they're going walk go beer. plenty stories medical vacations. 

Usually related emergencies though. one unlucky ones caught back March scariest week life, Even scarier though going loose legs why? hit drunk driver pinning cars least could actually breath without assistance.

I hospitalized rushed hospital ambulance couldn‚Äôt catch breath felt like running marathon almost go intubation managed high flow oxygen, don‚Äôt know anybody would willingly risk pure hell scary able take even smallest breath knowing undergo intubation may never see daughters family again.

I‚Äôd dumbass anti-maskers actually got come ER/ICU saw look people faces, hearing cries begging doctor intubate heard screams agony us went they‚Äôd actually wear mask.

But people drinking bleach **Their President** told empathy lacking monster upset losing person taught ride bike swim time growing figure support? Yes, lot idiots family. Unfortunately, actions idiots affect everyone else. taking seriously means infections, deaths, and/or economic/financial harm shutdowns. ignoramus like Joe Rogan uses platform spread completely unfounded bullshit, harmful even everything right. think legally enforce it, something constitutional clause ensures free interstate travel, please correct someone I'm wrong Pulse oximeters don‚Äôt work someone close death reason. It‚Äôs covid specific. EuRoPeAnS tHiNk sToOoPiD? Rube Goldberg welfare instead just... paying money. 15% Americans IQ less 85, cut joining military. That's 50 million people. reliable numbers come Spain New York antibody prevalence studies put IFR 1.5% 1.2% respectively, suffered massive nursing home deaths, pushed IFR up. CDC think good job protecting nursing homes (which typically account 40%-80% deaths) IFR 0.4% quite realistic. know got 0.26% from, Oxford recently reported deaths hospital patients fallen four fold, might right all.

The thing remember IFR fixed. depends old people getting infected are, good treatments compared April, whether hospital get overwhelmed, reliable antibody tests capturing true prevelance. could still 1% run ICU nurses. could well 0.26% protect elderly, antibody studies capturing large portion people show cell immunity. Reality complicated fluid. Absolutely right. mommy comes save every time crisis, incentive responsible conservative.

However lack economic stimulation plan re-opening kind disappointing honestly surprising. CCP usually quick whip stimulation projects. Yeah, job Carlsbad, plenty people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. mom works Poway area drive work see lot compliance there. Wish could say Carlsbad/Oceanside Yeah, know.

I actually think main reason reticent stats hospitals historically prone deal excess patients placing first ""spare"" trolleys, crappy short beds (""—Ç–æ–ø—á–∞–Ω—ã"") ward corridors. 

That case years pandemic, 100% happening now. detailed ward stats would require acknowledging extent hospitals reliant measures, even though administration years deal problem.

The meaning *flattering flatter curve, hand, assumes number people ultimately get infected, longer period curve means slowing spread epidemic peak number people requiring care time reduced, health care system idea spread infections longer period time.* Especially rich Americans weird family, way hell would okay husband going rofl Chief Health Officer province said chlorine pools low concentration kill virus. qualifications studies saying it‚Äôs safe? much hate people give staff hard time job, gyms give hard enough time cancelling memberships options give continue pay act asshole.

Just... expect us love that. imposed facemasks black list forever would probably cut arm ever voting them. people pushed it? Nothing hate. took away freedom make choice. Next time ask something, thats big fuck me.

This virus plays one humanity's major weaknesses. prostest protestors die. 4D chess right I‚Äôve never seen weak argument...get highly upvoted...it‚Äôs almost like want ignore entire population wearing masks...and pass blame tourists...that could shut down...during global pandemic...but ok...everything clearly everyone else‚Äôs fault own...does South Carolina mask mandate?...no?...is fault tourists continue let too?....welcome nation takes 0 accountability expert passing blame anyone silly Swedes planned herd immunity failed. lot learn US. comrade Noodles1927! missed post first time around.

How comrade?

Comrade TalaPark making anti-imperialist posts today. think get promotion ahead you.

Don't worry, propaganda good hers! I‚Äôm going make account read article say know. understand people might think different flu months ago death toll pandemic still small idea many people infected, now? Come on. 

Figuring takes quick glances statistics. around 20,000-60,000 yearly flu deaths US 131,000 COVID deaths far (the flu season exceeds number is... 1918-19). Plus flu season never killed 0.25% population New York City. brains people. 

Still though, get vaccine manage eliminate virus US, death toll COVID-19 pale comparison cumulative total flu seasons. wonder many lives flu common viruses we‚Äôll save future end making masks, fear crowds, hand washing part culture reaffirm importance getting flu shot.

I know pretty US-centric comment, seems like we‚Äôre, ironically, people ignorant seriousness deadliness virus. Lol deaths counted COVID money?

It‚Äôs double edge sword. Slurred words hard detect online. mathematical model assumed 100% recovery previous health issues. high school overpopulated portable classrooms baseball field. don‚Äôt physical space staff force needed, certainly. subs out, teachers working day without break, impossible expectations children staff alike, it‚Äôs going fall apart seams. vice president seemed indicate information, saying, ‚Äúand must tell you, today, can‚Äôt account reports cite. reality is, briefing received today, hospital capacity remains within manageable lines, 85% hospital beds spoken for, 88% ICU beds spoken for. continue see cases rising, we‚Äôve surveyed hospitals across state, personal protection equipment appears abundant supply.‚Äù

Powerful iraqi information ministry energy would agree that. lot people 65 older working local schools Maryland saying ""Time retirement!"" least get coronavirus control.

By control mean ""Have vaccine"" ""a bulletproof 999 1000 people treated CoVid-19 hospital live treatment!"" Although conflicts study: would activate think something could happen? Texas: Hold Beer.

Oh love Texas... aside governors absolute idiots live Oregon. 

Went 40-70 cases day way record 375 cases today. cases Portland (largest city) area one rural county large number food processors immigrant labor (conservative, low mask use). 

They expecting 900 cases per day 5000 cases per day mid-end July current trends continue. Governor teasing shutting things again. Indoor mask mandate put place July 1st. Portland week prior. 

Most everything back open phase 2 opening. Vast majority cases traced back 1: small family/friend gatherings homes 2: workplace outbreaks. 

They bars open since mid may without jump. Problem is, closing bars cripple state. 2nd largest income state lottery. 90% lottery play bars. shutter bars lesser degree restaurants; schools, state parks, agencies left without funding, leading massive layoffs loss service public. mention effect employees owners establishments. 

It's pretty scary spot be. 

As somebody working one agencies living agency housing; everything tied work. fought weeks. 5 weeks end end growth since shortly Memorial Day. 

I'm really, really, really, really hoping mask orders effective flattening curve. always said wasn‚Äôt possible keep us locked homes indefinitely. would cause harm good. Remember? tag line ‚Äú15 days slow spread‚Äù, ‚Äústay rock goes away‚Äù shut country month first confirmed case...lol Actual article source: nationalreview.com He's alive.

There period expected live. 30% death chance ?   cool live population dense area, Northern Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin, Michigan likely gonna take days minimum get test back. Likely lots way parts US. 

Maybe somewhere that's 3.5 hours away test quickly. US landmass access testing think do. Yes, *that* wake-up call... SMFH. Rubio really chance distinguish competent intelligent leader went crowd. Fucking dumbass Definitely control. city ? heard Sao Paulo ok getting little worse Can‚Äôt governor shut border? 

I don‚Äôt need asshats state going vacation Florida bringing COVID19 back them.  Weird tons Americans dying keep trying justify it. country shit nothing good. Enjoy corona parties 4th. poetic be? Getting sick party worst country earth.

Canada keep border closed. Nobody wants shitty Americans coming infecting shit. Didn‚Äôt Cuomo DeBlasio let go longer should‚Äôve, anyway; Cuomo cut healthcare funding? There's whole disinformation campaign trying maximize civilian casualties. I'm currently Maine, talk radio personalities heavily pushing idea masks plot divide us. Maybe 25% people wear masks shut travel China, left yelled racist. 

HCQ common drug used treat malaria rheumatoid arthritis. People travel certain parts world required take travel. It‚Äôs around since 1950s available generically. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard! So, won‚Äôt even try.‚Äù - scientist agree. It‚Äôs standard ‚Äúscience-speak‚Äù say ‚Äòno evidence‚Äô evidence, things communicated public. 

No evidence human-to-human transmission
No evidence immunity
No evidence masks help

All technically true statements early on, sends wrong message.

Maybe ‚Äúnot yet confirmed‚Äù ‚Äúnot yet known‚Äù would slightly better.  Qualified! Hope scam essential oils BS order online $299.99. Gift cards accepted  Im watching Chris Hayes rn he‚Äôs showing countries EU Asia going back normal activities, places like Czech masks social distancing even required. gives hope fear state fed leaders fubar‚Äôd pandemic; hope I‚Äôm wrong course shitty graph.

Unless anyone likes looking 50 different lines jumbled together tangled mass like wires behind desk. I'm glad government took seriously. seriously first time ever I've legit embarrassed American badly country handling this.

It's worse government though. Businesses plain stupid. work IT. Working home common industry. friends know several companies forcing employees back office holiday weekend. isnt reason so. Work getting done.  Upper management decided though come in, get fired. Damn I‚Äôm Connecticut drove hospital got tested questions asked, right car. asked name phone number. Keep mind population geographical features... Entitlement. winter coming colleges, especially top-tier universities decide gets universities doesn't? grades gamed system dependent school/teachers get. can't objectively judge student (who straight A's since coming high school) vs. student B (who went 2.0 4.0) without form standardized testing. hear people complain SAT, ACT college, yet one complains take LSAT, DAT, MCAT professional schools. lot colleges even require SAT. want go somewhere like Harvard, UCLA, Stanford, required take something allows admissions grade level everyone else. think understand threat poses readiness military forces. Damn Ron. state run? young obese likely develop severe cases Covid-19? 

My guess youthfulness masks machinery stress obese, add deadly viral illness enough send entire thing danger zone. Weird Canadians keep moving droves then. get 2-3k deaths single day 2 weeks national disasters people asked volunteer time- absolutely close hospital pandemic outbreak. might stop paying people work though. less insane governor lot states anyway. done alright overall, made batshit crazy decisions - really like even pretend apologise husband stupid shit stay home order.  Sure would nice knew China's real numbers started happening. Probably wouldnt make numbers like seem bad. told us 7k infected building new hospitals, nobody seemed give shit Texas also made masks mandatory hard judge certain performances time. I'm teacher. teacher works school putting 10 hours day. another put 1 hour week. get paid circumstances administration way seeing works doesnt. imagine many jobs circumstances arent clear output levels.

Also, many kids parents zoom meetings imagine would tell. lead horse public health, can't make drink. didn't. seen multiple sources (could someone please post battery die) proven significant spikes cases due Anyone wanna bet won‚Äôt enforced, crowd size doofus come mandate? Woah woah. Asking questions? Anti vaxxer! /s Literally country issue. wrong us?  ‚ÄúTell virus works I‚Äôll thrown helicopter‚Äù may say patriotic... ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø take prophylactic HCQ Zpacs like 2022? going um, little hard body? New York special city density population?? know bad might didn‚Äôt wear masks practice social distancing running arrive 30 35k tests Monday Wednesday week. 60k.

I know today's total near sofy cap.

Rt.live stop testing. Problem solved. veritable smorgasbord bad decisions here. Well majority bad. Also CA left leaning they've seen massive increase. Plus tons young people bars. they're blame. people Austin wearing masks? bet not. bars Austin packed? Yes are. Well drunk throws around 200 darts dartboard one going hit bullseye Also don‚Äôt get feeling many officers would feel comfortable approaching mask-less people Yeah one day it‚Äôll magically go away. that‚Äôs viruses do. never heard expression ‚Äúgo viral?‚Äù nothing insanely quickly viruses spread. means disappear based hopes whining. I‚Äôm confused. highly obese people 40 usually normal bio markers, young obese likely develop severe cases Covid-19? bio markers mediate? kind expected honestly, according plan. point things going reopen. Whenever happens, always going spike cases.

And likely true cases younger people far likely recover. fact, certain age (30?), likely die flu.

The plan flatten curve. wait vaccine may never get. afraid, every right isolate yourselves. others right go take risk.

Flattening curve cure disease. keeps numbers low enough overwhelm healthcare system. lower total cases, extends out.

If numbers cases going up, hospitalizations manageable death toll going down, could really great thing. could mean healthiest among us (those able endure COVID-19) creating herd immunity (one hopes).

There perfect solution. People get COVID, later. people getting manageable... probably good result could realistically hope for.

EDIT: Also, testing obviously cases revealed. So, simply stating confirmed cases mean much itself. Watching youtube videos good friends. 

Right guys??? Nonrandomized trial using multifactorial cocktail? racket anyway. sure downvoted. quote comes mind ""fuck around find "" Yet ratio deaths extremely low look state population new cases. media say damn word that. job cause panic... Panic sells us Americans. like positive story feed others misery. sounds horrible say know that's stone cold truth millions Americans die, contribute economy hth üëç Even burning corpses streets change mind. blood desantis abbott's hands, full stop. borderline criminal behavior calls commensurate consequences guy come job tell manager, respectfully told new mask regulations (they fining people now) know wear next time. guy proceeded tell manager cant fine shit ordinance law can't ask I.D fine him.

It shocked people like exist.  bail hospitals too! don‚Äôt see irony you? good luck us past time, well past. Oh boy... Monday Tuesday going spectacular  American academy pediatrics statement going back school pretty informative easy read. Keep mind recommendations made large group doctors, scientists, public health officials wellbeing children number one paragraph:

‚ÄúPolicy makers must also consider mounting evidence regarding COVID-19 children adolescents, including role may play transmission infection. SARS-CoV-2 appears behave differently children adolescents common respiratory viruses, influenza, much current guidance regarding school closures based. Although children adolescents play major role amplifying influenza outbreaks, date, appear case SARS-CoV-2. Although many questions remain, preponderance evidence indicates children adolescents less likely symptomatic less likely severe disease resulting SARS-CoV-2 infection. addition, children may less likely become infected spread infection. Policies mitigate spread COVID-19 within schools must balanced known harms children, adolescents, families, community keeping children home.‚Äù read atlantic article linked article? pretty long, call someone unqualified crackpot think important learn them. 

Literally entire career researching publishing studies demonstrate frequently 'misleading exaggerated studies' used, even years original publication data since plainly refuted. worked Harvard, John's Hopkins, NIH according atlantic article well respected research communities. 

Just saying. Massachusetts really well lately hopefully get spike two weeks everyone goes nuts fourth July also issue antibodies dying months. Reinfections reported fairly often now. though? many places even enforcing mask wearing fines? I've heard many all. make Mississippi look good I‚Äôm literally exact situation right (except mind would late August). made progress decision? case people don‚Äôt understand things like ‚Äòfreedumb‚Äô politicization mask wearing come from...

If you‚Äôre .001%er ‚Äî owner, plutocrat ‚Äî nothing want keep eyes wealth complete, divisive chaos insanity. Continuously.

They insane country. benefits them. makes public sphere unlivable completely unable challenge them. history. reason, people received flu vaccines seem fare better.

Holy Shit! Anti Vaxxers take note! I'm talking season.
Assuming canceled. Yes is, much fault. France‚Äôs flag red white blue share least 50% blame US cases. it‚Äôs 25, 000 daily cases really. mean facts.  Well, obviously. That's businesses do, make money. agoraphobia fear leaving house afraid situation can't escape get help start panic attack. bad, others quite difficult. Kevin Owens would large proponent wearing mask, wife's grandfather die covid-19 all. *britches*  think they'll keep going down? Quick, look there. guys guys they‚Äôre testing lot looks like lot cases guys

/s Michigander here. Sorry already thing??  wonder long fully understand virus. go Disneyland...

It‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre one terrible woke bellends can‚Äôt really bothered go long debates shit you‚Äôre typing painfully naive, obviously stupid childish.... NC = North Carolina Hiding covid doctor yet? like money, right??? things going across Europe? I'm NL reported weekly, /r/Coronavirus entirely US even really know numbers. sure testing capabilities positive percentages neighbouring countries. John Oliver said, can't wait go back hating cuomo And? seen pictures CHAZ? protests city hall? packed streets? We're going suffer. That‚Äôs aunt said Facebook. London locked 8th July cases East London surge. Well, wait three weeks see recent rise infections impact daily death rate.

Do really think people Belgium, Italy, Spain France look USA (in horror) didn‚Äôt severe impact? statistical basis?  Trump definitively partly, individually, responsible, large part blame goes divided political climate, mostly blame GOP, see side would argue that.

If Obama, Hillary, Bernie office Covid19 doubt personal response would better, overall deaths would significantly fewer, doubt issue still would seriously politicized including mask wearing. honestly think spend time proofing copy editing comments write forum??? get paid comment here?

Comments like always crack up. Oh Nos write perfect comments horror. lol Cut check see writing looks like. lol Standards vaccines much stricter drugs. Drugs administered sick people.

Obviously people scared say there‚Äôs potentially less feel invalidated feelings. That‚Äôs thought. far whistleblowers said, already China October initially milder version could handle degree mutated lethal version ccp claims came Europe Africa USA whatever pin at. milder version would obviously easily spread globally without catching much attention, regardless ccp ties Brazilian government could samples planted attempt throw guilt around. comes ""shatters""  Every WTF story starts ""Florida Man""...

We smarter stop happening on. UK still getting Huawei networks? hahah. Come Brits. random (independent) take account fact virus spreads within families classrooms. 


Also, even without knowing positive within family classroom, still actionable information. Everyone group known exposed quarantine/isolate. one explain me, say ‚Äúrise‚Äù ‚Äúnew infections‚Äù, based percentage ratio tests coming back positive, high numbers they‚Äôre testing more? Well people he's claiming parents [are real people indeed die coronavirus](http://apps.pathology.jhu.edu/blogs/pathology/in-memoriam-of-william-bill-j-kidwell-and-christine-chris-kidwell). says son named Chris guy claiming is. he's probably telling truth unless he's impersonating guy reason, would creepy bizarre. sad though someone could callous continue spread misinformation parents die it. actually someone worth voting for? I'm sick options bullshit horseshit. Report violating distancing orders, please prevent year? US bottomed cases June (lowest since March, much higher testing) Northeastern peak subsided gathered momentum elsewhere areas less density international travel, bottoming deaths weeks later inevitable.

Now positivity rate increasing new hotspots virus spreading faster testing capacity, would argue faster rate improvement treatments well, correct see significant rise fatalities August. highly doubt said case. that‚Äôs it‚Äôs business.

those old men business either That's great hear!üòä Pleaple taking control lives badass Yeah continue parting resuming NBA Basketball important! Stupid trump issue empathy. take something directly affect care said issue? don‚Äôt know said wrong thought great points. guess Tide pods work. personal theory supported data even basic reality.

No expert said protesting important stopping covid. Otherwise post source direct quote. 
The Trump admin said masks work. 
There thousands experts claimed exact opposite. Even WH said masks pointless, run N95's, obviously even regular citizens disagreed follows advice basically every expert work WH. 
And researchers reporting protests meaningfully increase infections‚Äîare saying work Trump administration? see conflating opposing groups people make kind nonsensical argument basic facts. Apparently expert rest world's epidemiologists wrong. people power realised doesnt kill rate enough care, said fuck opening everything.

The point pointing obesity when, months ago, young person died ""no pre-existing conditions"" every single article photos clearly obese. media putting people's lives risk ignoring important pre-existing condition somehow polite point someone obese obesity contributed death covid.

If overweight obese (and obesity SMALLER think), need extra careful; pre-existing condition. bunch doctors come say think single medical condition would specifically affected wearing mask? mean outside literally wearing oxygen haha words, even two weeks ago?  supposing hit body tremendous ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs ultraviolet powerful light ‚Äî think said hasn‚Äôt checked, you‚Äôre going test it. said, supposing brought light inside body, either skin way, think said you‚Äôre going test too. sounds interesting. . . see disinfectant, knocks minute.

I really don‚Äôt know fall. links image dead unfortunately, go. also resources posted people thread. Well test 10 samples negative, got 9 extra tests done time.

If comes back psotitve, 10 individual tests run 11 total tests.

It works better positive rate lower. Florida pretty high rate they'd probably pools 5  guess possible came Brazil month emerged China. Especially Chinese travel went Brazil vice versa. welcome Brazil already November far away China, early China? Early October? Apple doesn‚Äôt drop far tree Yeah, think annoying NY/NJ/CT politicians act like great job literally world's highest per capita death tolls allowed citizens leave states peak epidemic seed rest country. bit annoyed. restricted movement tri-state area March/April, rest country could spared.

Spoiler alert: die slowly. ## Estudo, que ainda n√£o foi revisado por pares, teve resultado divulgado nesta quinta-feira (2) pela Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. Pesquisadores dizem que, at√© momento, essa √© amostra mais antiga novo coronav√≠rus nas Am√©ricas.

A non-peer-reviewed study Santa Catarina University released thurday. Researchers claim oldest sample contain covid-19 virus.

*Um estudo divulgado nesta quinta-feira (2) pela Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC) afirma ter descoberto part√≠culas novo coronav√≠rus (Sars-CoV-2) em duas amostras esgoto de* *colhidas em 27 de novembro de 2019. pesquisa ainda n√£o publicada por revista cient√≠fica que tenha como crit√©rio uma revis√£o por pares*

A study released Thursday (07/02/2020) UFSC, affirms found particles novel corona virus two samples collect Florianopolis sewers 27th november, 2019. research yet peer-reviewed.

The first brazilian clinical corona virus case found January, 2020.

*Intitulado ""SARS-CoV-2 human sewage Santa Catarina, Brazil, November 2019"", novo estudo tem participa√ß√£o de pesquisadores da UFSC, da Universidade de Burgos, da Espanha, e da start-up Neoprospecta/BiomeHub, de Florian√≥poli*s.

Entitled ""SARS-CoV-2 human sewage Santa Catarina, Brazil, November 2019"", new study comes partnership UFSC researchers, Burgos University, Spain, start-up Neoprospect/BiomeHub, Florianopolis based.

*Segundo UFSC, uma vers√£o preliminar artigo foi enviada na sexta-feira (26) √† plataforma MedRxiv, que re√∫ne pesquisas ainda n√£o divulgadas em revistas cient√≠ficas, ou seja: que ainda n√£o foram revisadas pelos comit√™s das publica√ß√µes. Nesse processo, cientistas normalmente an√¥nimos e especialistas na √°rea abordada fazem avalia√ß√£o e sugerem modifica√ß√µes ou mesmo rejei√ß√£o estudo.*

According UFSC, one preliminar article version sent friday (26th) plataform MedRxiv, collects non-peer-reviewed/pre-print researches. Blablabla, explaining peer-review means.

*Conforme UFSC, at√© momento amostra coletada esgoto de Florian√≥polis √© mais antiga novo coronav√≠rus nas Am√©ricas. Embora primeira descri√ß√£o Sars-CoV-2 seja de 31 de dezembro de 2019, pesquisas semelhantes constataram que ele estava presente esgoto de Wuhan, na China, em outubro, e na It√°lia, in√≠cio de dezembro.*

According UFSC, sample collect Florianopolis sewage oldest sample found America moment. Even though first description Sars-CoV-2 31st december 2019, similar studies found present sewage samples Wuhan, China back October, Italy, beginning December.

Then goes virus takes time incubate symptons appears.

## Como foi feita pesquisa

How study done:

*Foram analisadas amostras congeladas de esgoto bruto -- que tinham sido coletadas por outros estudos dentro da universidade -- final de outubro ano passado at√© in√≠cio de mar√ßo de 2020 da rede p√∫blica da regi√£o central de Florian√≥polis. ideia dos pesquisadores foi investigar material como ferramenta epidemiol√≥gica*

Frozen samples untreated sewage -- collect researches ran university -- collected Florianopolis region, ranging october last year till march 2020.

*As amostras entre 30 de outubro e 6 de novembro n√£o tinham Sars-CoV-2. Na de 27 de novembro, carga era de 100 mil c√≥pias de genoma v√≠rus por litro, considerada baixa pelos pesquisadores. quantidades subiram em 11 de dezembro e 20 de fevereiro e, em 4 de mar√ßo, foi constatado um milh√£o de c√≥pias de genoma de Sars-CoV-2 por litro de esgoto.*

The samples collect 30th October 6th november didnt traces Sars-CoV-2. 27th november however, 100 thousand copies virus genoma per litre found, considered low amount. quantity rose 11th dezember 20th february, 4th march sample found one million copies virus genoma per litre sewage.

*Conforme Gislaine, para se chegar aos resultados de que eram mesmo part√≠culas novo coronav√≠rus, foram feitos testes com base em quatro marcadores para genoma v√≠rus. Para cada amostra foram realizadas, pelo menos, oito testagens.*

According Gislaine, tests based 4 markers covid-19 genoma run confirm particles found indeed novel corona virus. sample done least 8 testing.

Then article goes say ran additional tests, one comparing spike protein, one membrane another virus nucleus. that, extracted fragments ran sequence fragments (like...dng sequencing... u know). pretty sure found covid samples.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This best could time...pretty sleepy hate translating articles. many differences language structures. articles are, theres lot repetition well.

My 2 cents:This study done start-up... Non peer-reviewed. plausible, still take grain salt. sounds like something Ebony Maw would say. Uncanny ""Argument""? Experts strong agreement median age key relevant factor. I'm aware even ""fringe"" people would disagree thoroughly researched epidemiological related component.

The median 67 seven year old Sumter County mentioned contains retirement community seen Trump's retweet ""white power"" guy. completely fits dictionary definitions race age ""segregation.""

Current median 35 year old covid positive Floridians seem less statistically likely interact county younger counties. ""argument"", passing along available info.

Florida diverse, county level starters, even deeper feels really disingenuous argue things heading positive direction Florida way, shape, form.

Who arguing that? 8th grade math basic understanding modern medicine tells us 10,000 cases 35 year olds equals different 10,000 cases 65 years old. bad, one worse.  Woof. Personal attacks.

Here L. sub like it, right. UK spike protests. day stuff. busy beaches. typical mask wearing around **3 times less USA**

Outdoor transmission indoor transmission worlds apart. Oh know exponential growth, I'm math major. bad can't even imagine seeing 3 weeks. Smh Yes, countries known frigid climates Race Bannon strikes again. stupid. risk getting arrested resisting arrest? There‚Äôs way science involved I‚Äôll ever understand. it‚Äôs interesting happened guy right outbreak started NYC. We‚Äôve seen significantly less edge cases like coming light drop deaths per case drastic across board US. thing he‚Äôs going get best doctors world, best resources available guaranteed shortage anything. doesn‚Äôt anything worry going taken care better anybody else feel like USA catching news 3-5 month ago

This second article today nature... looks like 40% population kind mental illness. ü§î Numbers didn‚Äôt happen parents talk whole load stupid ass people wear masks social distance, going friends houses parties inviting friends parties home, everyone close quarters. 
 
I want break fact stupid people talk -- would like risk kicked house tonight. explosion COVID-19 cases around country. That‚Äôs guess. 

Oh, meant sarcastically... um. Nothing? Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself?  We‚Äôre paying money health workers fixing problem. US economy sooo wrongly incentivized... it‚Äôs fucked. Well time. Hope states follow. Thanks, long time since studied maths. Although totals would grow cubic function new cases would grow quadratically new cases derivative total cases. hey! We‚Äôre back number one again! thing think AZ summer like cold places winter. summer everyone stays Indoors AC. People go winter here. 

That‚Äôs main reason think hottest, sunniest, driest state country many cases middle summer. 

Also yeah, Arizona pretty conservative. sub fear-mongering like crazy. actively WANT miserable locked years come. Reality is, Fauci experts said expect vaccine end year early 2021. Based US government pay money directly businesses require businesses keep staff employed? monopoly use force, authority derives. also kill virus...

 US even running behind this? got mask mandates stores/public places Europe seems work. reinfections superspreader events clubs/bars.  Eh. numbers. India's death rate ~7%. translates 100 million people dying every year India. 14 countries world even 100 million people them. That's 33 million people 4 months. 20,000 6% that. come one affected cities India - Chennai. overall number deaths city average years we've sort lockdown March onward. India bloodshed already bought time ~2 months nationwide lockdown. I'm imagining honking like geese way down. Many countries opened schools never closed - Netherland, Switzerland, Sweden come mind - single outbreak originating younger children. countries testing lot.

The fact dozens people thread happily accept wildly inaccurate news article misquoting single flawed study (while probably extolling virtues ‚Äúscience‚Äù elsewhere) goes show den disinformation panic sub become. 

Based currently know, sending (young) child school par vaccinating - harmful, irresponsible decision rational justification job, therefore unemployment exist. Two sides coin... seems DeSantis monkeying up... health serivices overrun people start dying who, they'd enough resources help them, would lived.

A drain handle average day's rainfall day. handle average month's rainfall day, going fail there's going flooding.

Lockdowns try slow infection rate level health services handle. nation doesn‚Äôt like math, education, knowledge, professionals, evolution, logic, it‚Äôs concern. Yes. Naturally. imagine people testing negative (globally). recently learned I'm vitamin deficient I'm glad found out. I'm prescription strength supplements, hopefully brings levels up. scary think would happened never found üòû airbnb delenda est Yeah, sorry clear meant bundling people within household, across households. 

And right voluntary quarantine. That's I've pretty much since March. I'm fortunate work home factors make pretty easy. feel bad people would like stay safe can't. hand, people even trying. . . Sure, people China try profit situations hopeful Chinese government act accordingly.

However, damage already done, people held accountable. Fake medical gear pandemic could really damaging China‚Äôs already denigrated reputation. getting started That's decision. know his.

Christopher Reeve regret surviving accident. That‚Äôs blatantly illegal. remember seeing post small pox quarantine Simpson County 1898 seriously intense isolating county laws place encouraging others contact law enforcement others justice. 'clean' Simpson County would force surrounding counties infected counties stay away enter Simpson County. mail carrier systems stopped, practicing physicians allowed travel borders. Ferrymen rivers subject quarantine laws. 

Every citizen county requested guard report sheriff infractions law. violation quarantine laws 30-day imprisonment fine 50 dollars. ~ 1550 modern dollar value. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz) 
 health officials like Anthony Fauci Deborah Birx prevented contradicting many President Trump‚Äôs ""stated goals actions"" comes economy.

His parents worked John Hopkins, says John Hopkins messed father's surgery twice, yet guys primary care doctor still John Hopkins?

He also says different posts dad came home coronavirus father spread mother. goes different posts say symptoms mild bounced back quickly, another says symptoms severe, another states symptoms mild suffered severe sickness.

He says reputable doctors told white blood cells effective killing virus, killing virus completely start attacking body leading death. absolutely working. 

He using subreddit spread alot misinformation using stories claims personal experiences dont stay consistent. fox news Trump? X opinions change happen? Single annoying thing appears least loud-mouthed faction which, charitably, asks us aware dangers coming China, easily. Uncharitably, they're clearly ideologically driven a-holes want use us grind hate-boner with. charitable framing something try acknowledge, uncharitable one increasingly proving truth. Basically, yes. California 5 - 7 days, least step 10 day wait period month ago, still terrible following covid December? first media report around Dec 30? think heard Jan 1 _maybe_ New Year's Eve I'm nerd sort stuff. following? Finally!!  Entirely anecdotal know, NL opened junior schools daycares fairly early (beginning May) everyone sat baited breath waiting spike ..... never came. (and remains) controversial time alternate (science based) proposition children carriers negligible transmission rate child adult. Also children asymptomatic. 

The real extra measures schools implemented are: staggered drop of/pick reduce parent contact, parents classrooms pick up/drop off, extra hand washing, extra room/equipment/toy cleaning. masks, expectation kids keep physical distance etc. Teachers offered level test availability nurses etc potential symptoms caught contained quickly. knowledge hot spots related schools all. 

Like said, know it‚Äôs controversial anecdotal degree, Dutch numbers attest contained managed situation. schools open impact numbers. 

I hope offers reassurance. I've seen suggest less tenth population far. That's much considering many hospitals already capacity. Hospitals overwhelmed (although getting close lot areas), majority infected seem younger people now, possibly treatments getting better? Reddit. hate women here. That‚Äôs lame cross EU borders week.

In Spain, travel State State two days ago. three months even leave *city* Madrid.

US state borders never shut. all. tried reading article get bombarded ads redirect another story. interested happened, article title makes sound like went party died within 24hrs Yeah imagine isolation loss socialization they'll experience parents get intubated spreads around schools biggest thing husband throws face ‚Äú don‚Äôt job‚Äù ‚Äú don‚Äôt contribute‚Äù take care kids day 1. make enough I‚Äôm able I‚Äôm constantly shamed family ( well one relative) 

I don‚Äôt help even school session nobody take &amp; pick kids watch them. Definitely couldn‚Äôt afford childcare ( I‚Äôd basically working pay childcare makes sense) wanted school them. grew day care &amp; camps hated it! Also treated horribly one daycare providers years. something gonna could matter what. wanted stay home kids.

We even agreed early I‚Äôd stay home, covid virus, he‚Äôs STILL ass school air. reference? far brightest scientists begin with. I've travelled internationally. opinion still stands. strange right party one less strict rules. Strict rules, authoritarianism keeping people safe enemy seem like right qualities. Especially makes sense also currently charge. EU country center-right party strict one pushes anti corona restrictions makes sense opinion. It‚Äôs okay got see beach USA! USA! USA!

Dallas voted 61.1% Hillary vs 34.9% trump. taking about? That's true. I'm impression survey asking agressive yelling, really bickering. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø people statistically likely die upset harder kill them. Whereas young people probably experience nasty cold, relieved less likely pass on. cannot wrap head even slightly around this. even tiny bit. Stay safe dude. Wishing someone dead morally indefensible. 

Wishing someone catch disease end changing ways might be... different? And? would honestly good thing. Maybe people would realize absolutely dishusting making unpaid prisoners risk lives save homes wealthy. government Florida criminally negligent point tried human rights violations Died with? understand difference? can't believe many stupid degenerates are. insane people went hoarding supplies, protesting lockdowns, making masks political statement. president throws salt wound consistently downplaying virus. trust him, trust now. Eh, even 10 years ago sold 1500 seat venue downtown Portland, Oregon...so imagine still draw crowd bit.  No, I'm talking comment replied staying grandparents/aunts/cousins young, 10 11, home alone? Hi might. piccy looks like la plaza de Espa√±a Seville. think cautious opened weeks ago?

I understand point, nobody said Disney's decision good one, cautious one, cautious parks already open. called opinion, dick swallow.  like mask. pretty good eyesight could easily read 10-15 feet away (Not medical scientist) reading paper bit looking article (not enough formal paper review) notice discrepancy age given hydroxychloroquine (mean 71) vs hydroxy (mean 53). Another interesting notion difference treating steroids. hydroxy treated patients, 78.9% patients treated corticosteroids 35.7% non medicated patients received treatment. 

Also, despite political battling, I'm really glad people going research articles. would always recommend going credible journals reading research buzz is. Even ""best"" research thoroughly questioned processed. read, understand ask better questions future. respond messages anymore.

Comrade like this! fight imperialist! Yeah I'm aware assault actually threatening someone? Shouting threat. It‚Äôs going happen. It‚Äôs going play like NY (with political nonsense). Anyone needs get sick get sick. Anyone needs die die. I'm NY. please close fucking borders.

And type damage virtually diseases pretty much always shown recoverable. ""Survival rate"" context misleading. guy potentially ""survive"", too. reality people pretty much ages get experience excruciating symptoms, even die. old people disease, 'outliers' far statistically relevant trying claim.

Take cars example. ~150k deaths, many people decent cars? 100k? that‚Äôs 100k decent used cars potentially re-entering market. Normally US buys what, 17 million new cars year? 100k isn‚Äôt exactly giant impact right?

Even every single one 100k used cars prevented new car sale... that‚Äôs 2 days worth cars.

Well many people work changed jobs can‚Äôt afford new car? many aren‚Äôt driving much? many going put new car? many can‚Äôt afford payment new car bought last year year 3 years that, they‚Äôre underwater....

New car sales down. impacts auto workers suppliers whole industry.

The said LOTS job markets. Keeping people home watch kids act teachers aids households kids virtual-school may economically beneficial thing people right now. possibly frees another job someone else too.

We can‚Äôt restart economy fully get virus control anyways. 15% unemployment 10% 5% working working home taking care family. Either way, economy level fucked, keeping kids safe let‚Äôs us get back normal sooner. Can‚Äôt articulate thoughts. can, please do. Australians. Dumb ones. Hope so. hate thought bringing home family young child I‚Äôm teacher. mean definitely parties way too. thing stopping anyone much hassle right now. go alaska Hangs like sleeve wizard. really. mostly control here. might local outbreaks again, immediately squashed.

Of course cannot yet predict happen fall. Still Europe much better prepared February ""All two carried amount virus adults, that's researchers say children considered transmitters unless proven otherwise.""

[He. Did. Not. 

This anti masker meme. 

In February gave interview said little *current* need 'at time' people wear said would little protect wearer (this entirely true). people starting hoard shit like toilet paper concern people would go hoard masks, too, obviously needed health care workers. 

As cases increased became widespread, supply PPE's increased, telling people wear them. lie, contradiction. situation evolved masks werent needed february, april. 

If someone says need winter coat july snows december, lie you?

The people claim said something different people anti science, pro trump, anti mask agenda. help perpetuate it. Ah, risk death upon conviction mass? Even us heathens pagans unsaved? mean.. kind sounds like business usual. True Grocery stores huge problem TX mask enforcement. getting food go curbside isn‚Äôt available. Even exemptions, even months late, step right direction. draining feel much sympathy whole country. sad, right. hard feel sorry people anymore. much let in.  Same, he's person thought was. There's going lot EV alternatives soon. quality debate Reddit?  Sometimes forget I‚Äôm arguing 17 year olds.  doesn‚Äôt necessarily make wrong, make incredibly immature. Yup. Sorry got hit, think Oxford vaccine one. let‚Äôs get ahead ourselves. 

The amount work going vaccines astounding. create vaccine scratch year unprecedented. chop arm 2 seconds ago, permanent arm damage. wait long time know that. analogy apply lungs. Look good lungs repairing themselves. (Hint: very). offense original poster, I‚Äôve grown tired ‚Äúwhat asshole didn‚Äôt take seriously wants know (take seriously), stories. 

I don‚Äôt recall normal times sewing story story someone ate lead paint chips telling us did. 

It‚Äôs enough already. know stay safe, don‚Äôt need telling us learn dumbass mistakes! look Iran numbers see country two clear spikes. peak second wave infections correlates lowest death rate looks similar US currently stands (although smaller scale). second peak deaths happens three weeks later. various lags involved - getting tested, test results reported, difference becoming infected, becoming infectious, displaying symptoms, hospitalised, recovering dying - difficult everyone get heads around. safe say US inadvertently going herd immunity approach point?

It's currently leading (in terms timeline) candidate, based existing delivery platform (an adenovirus common chimpanzees), already tested safety. allowed researchers move efficacy trials quickly.

Production vaccine start shortly (or already started), results trial in. risk production covered partially governments NGOs. Several countries already placed orders large quantities vaccine delivered ASAP.

The optimistic timeline vaccine distributed end users September, may delayed since researchers hit setback infection rates primary trial region (the UK) started decline, threatening make whatever result comes enough statistical value draw conclusion. They've expanded trial Brazil South Africa, might delay this. last heard, CDC giving official estimate case fatality rate .26% overlords vote for. also helped leak information Chinese government hiding. main problem social media, American media, politicians government agencies untrustworthy social media becomes empowered. know there's going Netflix series 2 years South African here.. We're coming would agree one. I'd cautious take vaccine clearly rushed. grandma lost 20 lbs last couple months. 

Last phone call got nursing home ""she could longer swallow"". Which, think necessarily true, there's really nothing do. 

I know call coming gone. fair, suffering Alzheimer's decade now. hope chance we'll get say goodbye. would fucking hope so. I've said long time...one worst things happen wages labor two-income-families became norm.

I say this, Everytime people jump ""that's sexist"". not. I'm saying women work. I'm saying women stay home kids. saying 50-60 years ago, modest single income could support family even retire reasonable age savings.

When two-incomes became norm, labor force (supply) doubled labor pool (demand) stagnated barely grew. 

We need return economy allows family survive modestly single incomes. Whether that's man woman matter (and equal pay equal work), economy able allow SAHM/SAHD norm, exception. Pretty much anywhere world. most. get piles bodies see tv hospitals really overwhelmed.  wat really. better

Thank you. conflated two incorrectly long country quarantine right ""border"" yeah, need lockdown. err side caution far I'm concerned unless NZ one countries community transmission less 100 cases active, quarantine everybody coming in. think important disagree publicly, albeit politely, even full-on anti-vax / flat-earth / 5G-virus-spreading nutjobs.

There could others social group background science might susceptible bad/arguments / logical fallacies. give grasp logic relates reality argument. gotta peer pressure establishes conspiracy theories core belief. Better treatments, younger infected cohort, hospitals overwhelmed yet, reporting lags even lag deaths, states actually protecting nursing homes. Could anything, really. We're 100,000 new infections past couple days alone, means next exponential leap going bonkers people undoubtedly infected bunch diagnosed.

If deaths spike uncontrollably next couple weeks, maybe dodged bullet figured something prevent them. probably bad New York, probably going really bad. might ignore 'click ticket' laws, won't. honestly can't believe business usual Florida tomorrow... 

Your cases skyrocketing, hospitals already filling up. common knowledge things get really bad, really fast? Australia performing tens thousands tests. Stop spreading misinformation Wow didnt know  South football-crazy, maybe he's prepping population cancelling high school college football? could cause riots, especially Clemson fans.... would surprised already knew SEC seriously considering cancelling season, hosting games empty stadiums.... flattened curve. masks became political lost results effort. Mexico might well start building wall keep US I'm still going things enjoy, I'm also smart. I'm seeing vulnerable friends family members, I'm keeping distance masks store assumption legitimate reason worried. Everyone punished virus deaths 70. basing science whatsoever. far early saying anything long term health implications. yet getting upvoted fighting one piece anti-science anti-science.

You realise, Mr Smart guy, flu strains also binary too, right? Also, according Drosten, try infect noses spread easily lungs hit hard... hopeful? Easter 2022, maybe Gee totally didn‚Äôt see happening. like criticized without finding counter examples. .3% NYC‚Äôs population dying 20-25% testing positive antibodies? Bergamo, Spain, hot spots? IFR numbers fucking joke.  Texas facing teacher shortage years several ... machine I'd done thing, I'm rich. 50% improvement status quo good? Like, would mean we'd cut deaths/infections half. Anyways, mixed sensitivity specifity. Doesnt change fact PCR tests useless sending many people false-positive results quarantine. need stop Bullshit pannicking. Many top scientist alreay spoken out, chekoht Prof. Bhakdi Germany example wish anyone. don‚Äôt think way social equality real change come deaths America. mean ones hit home communities? Close family friends. That‚Äôs way think Americans take seriously. think pandemic force society make changes. protests efforts. pandemic. 
Does make sense silly? Wow. Trying discredit opinion looking unrelated comments? I‚Äôm real discussion this. Use facts let‚Äôs talk this. Tell me, survival rate Covid-19? Empire could mean several things - would United States stop major player world politics? No. 

But ongoing crisis, breakdown social contract, economic depression looming - United States almost certainly lose much hegemonic standing compared say likes China EU. cabling pretty essential I'd say. quarantine wiring gets rekt? plumbing etc fair, good chance got number places may gone believing virus. Unfortunately Fox News‚Äô nonsense tight grip stupid mean considering people think mass infection so-called ""immunity"", far off... #Translation:


The Ministry Foreign Affairs changes recommendation travel Kronoberg Blekinge regions Sweden. guides change.

Denmark opens border citizens Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea Thailand.

This stated Ministry Foreign Affairs.

Although citizens countries question welcome enter Denmark, travel guidance Danes wish travel six countries changed right now.

Denmark chosen change travel guide countries. due entry restrictions quarantine requirements countries concerned.

""If country, like Foreign Ministry alone discourages travel due entry restrictions quarantine requirements, lift, travel guide eased, ""reads Press release Ministry Foreign Affairs.
Thus, unnecessary journeys continue discouraged countries outside Europe, journeys six countries Europe also advised.

This applies Romania, Portugal, United Kingdom, Ireland Sweden-- northern 
Region V√§sterbotten along Kronoberg Blekinge exempt.

#Six European countries still orange

The changed travel guides must seen light two things. Europe, travel guides updated every Thursday afternoon. guidances based number so-called objective criteria. Among things, number infected persons must less 20 infected per 100,000 inhabitants.
For countries outside Europe, announcement comes EU Council Tuesday changed recommendations entry 14 countries. new recommendations state EU countries open travelers Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia Uruguay.
Common countries changing status ""yellow"" far countries where, due corona epidemic, discouraged travel.

If country changes color red shuts traveling here, Foreign Ministry 
Advice ""you finish holiday"" take corona test back Denmark.
*In graph see countries meet infection requirement. 'green' countries thus less 20 infected per 100,000 inhabitants per week past week. Sweden Portugal right meet criterion*. 
[Ed. note: it‚Äôs worth checking graph see large Sweden‚Äôs infection burden compared rest EU.]

#You still careful

When color many countries changes yellow, also means countries residents free travel Denmark - noticeably document least six nights entry. However, citizens Norway exempt accommodation requirement.

Although travel several countries open, visitors must continue take precautions take extra care minimize risk infected coronavirus.

* article updated 19:24: Ministry Foreign Affairs changed travel guide yesterday travel Malta longer advised against.*  link data showing deaths skyrocketing? Mental disability. ^^eli12_please... much less could care..?

personally- *couldn't* care less **you** get it. Legend flashback. Even wait several months due manufacturing, distribution vaccinating everyone seeing light end tunnel green-lit vaccine would relief. least me. Cool! Yeah I'm also part Syrian Iranian.

That's meant. Everybody knows lot Indians ancestors modern day Pakistan. advice. wanted reach send love. sorry loss. hope youre able find peace soon. Much love yours. Ah is. crossed work go visit customers. got customs papers parts delivering considered part trade. also done registered system already crossing times deliveries. risky try cross say business never done before. ask work never crossed previous times work. Also good bring letter company visiting invitation cross. scenarios sometimes pulled stupid letter print myself. crossings logged. live detroit-windsor border. People Windsor want keep closed. miss crossing social life. condition putting higher risk category matter? fucking insane, stop normalizing bullshit Stupidity genetic, technically correct. I‚Äôd like think that, somehow evolved time become *this stupid*. Another catastrophic genetic bottleneck ensure idiocracy ushered quicker. Ya India probably worse USA right testing nearly enough Lol. That‚Äôs anything GMP works. average you‚Äôre talking couple years facilities get certified produce GMP products, years incorporate product production vaccine itself. 

Can fast track things due urgency? Surely. It‚Äôs near simple ‚Äúrepurposing‚Äù something though. faster simpler things replicate fast go generations fast well. trait helps infect procreate rapidly becomes dominant. essentially becoming adapt environment. humans might much able chew better, stronger immune system, would take many generations, mean become adapted environment. live longer better, procreate more. risk assessment. likely virus remerge next months. vaccines fail Germany terrible situation. basically shut cyclical shut downs prsy vaccine clears trials Christmas.

Now possible Oxfors vaccine shows efficacy. could happen.

Still likely fail. I'd much rather Sweden doesnt worry damn thing. Death rate isn‚Äôt spiking hope wake call Trump conservatives.

Hoping people like see light losing play part reason going fucking shit what's stopping you? care want herd immunity, I'm sure find local testing area get someone who's positive get infected small bit money. timing **was large part strategy itself**. many wondering didn‚Äôt early phase answer given timing would wrong! It‚Äôs better wait implementing restrictions ‚Äúmaximal effect‚Äù. I'm getting serious SCP Foundation vibes here, anyone else ? guys call Mexico yet? might interested ""joint venture"" ""project"" look War Plan Red. I‚Äôve researching since nice conversation. wish happened. mean, Alaska already, claiming rest would futile maybe east coast. study even needed first place? obvious even without study. Local Sweden well reputed source within Sweden, Local offshoots (Denmark, Norway, France, etc.). major European news service English speakers. I'm sure every Indian basically mixed race nowadays seeing people coming going centuries. Half genes North areas Pakistan beyond half South. wife trace ancestry far East West.

The point called mixed race make opinion important give deeper insight. Saying Indian sufficient. problem could correct itself. Californian wishes housing prices 15.00, every day like clockwork.  I‚Äôm unbelievably sorry loss. hope find answers. would require cohesive functional government, guess that's preview next year's shitshow. year antivaxxers. many listened? America, evidently few. soon weather started warming people force infect everyone else.....pathetic....and stupid shit again---I guarantee it. Oh well, guess need thin herd bit. Maybe wont bad thing 200,000 deaths tue summer over. ones live smart ones ones die dumb fucks. Chinese downvote brigade force.

Yes, virus came illegal military research Wuhan. probably escaped accident.

And supposed know that. This. insurance sucks pretty bad employer. nose bleed last year urgent care center strongly recommended go ER sure something serious. there, asked sent ER mere nose bleed.

- gone health centers make sure code tube referral. risk people mild symptoms, hand, risk thought healthy, not, passed infection.

None tested worked health care sector.

Although several received wrong answer may infected others, probably infection tracking [contact tracing].

#2 Goal cast net persuasive grossly innacurate theories ""create"" new experts completely unqualified advise important topic. 

#3 Goal many strangers possible re-tweet re-post re-link grossly innacurate information

Final goal convince persuade many people possible adopt lies FUD fact berate ridicule critical thinker believes facts proven true. 

This view social media. anyone smaller european countries claim 'hit hard' virus? exactly damning condemnation point. doubt. also leads people believeing 100 people died one day.  get it. one sees work cannot post selfies gym, even work out? Seriously. Ignorance didnt come nowhere. theres obvious way fix it. see limit number people allowed gather church. Many Trump-supporting Evangelicals probably wear masks (just hunch). Besides, would people see holy wear mask? I'm kidding. One reason lower death toll finally figured shield vulnerable groups bit better. there's ""harvesting effect"". Right infection burden remains extremely high, highest Europe, spreading mostly among younger people. helps LOT death rate, thankfully. committing get involved someone giving emplyee hard time; whos me??! fucking psychopaths wallstreet care. Yeah, really fucking sucks vaccine protect person vaccinated? would everyone else NEED take it? hopeful. Vaccine safety comes two parts, first, body react vaccine itself. Redness, fever, muscle soreness, kind reactions. much severe ones, however much experience vaccine platforms already usually issue. is, Phase Phase II studies catch early on. 

Now second part, much trickier, immune system react case vaccination + virus exposure. impossible know without getting vaccine virus, Phase II trials help us much here. far, 0 data part safety. much likely problems safety aspect, one mentioned (vaccine itself). common safety issues include ADE (the virus making sicker vaccinated), skewed immune responses (virus messing immune system vaccinated). issues well. seen past, including previous SARS animal coronavirus vaccines. safety issues quite real, vaccine developers checking reporting without doubt, required to. 

In terms speeding up, trials still done be, vaccine developers cutting corners terms safety rush vaccine. Nobody wants headline ""Company X's coronavirus vaccine, veins millions, actually makes sicker"". 

Then possible long term effects road, 5-10 years now. quite rare, without enough time passing, way knowing. take risks assume infection without vaccinated detrimental, likely true. 

About production, vaccines high quality standards, going able keep standards pumping millions doses per day? hope so, probably can. yes, nuts argue protests partially responsible cases.

in event, care either way. bunch young people infected immune? awesome. like mini-vaccination drive! Khabib Cali training April 18 fight flew back home weeks before.. gets announced father tested positive. Can‚Äôt rule infect father next 2 weeks going bumpy ride sure We've got another 500 years get advanced. disagree, proper use mandatory. people constantly touching it, removing temporarily putting mask increase risk.

This one reasons mask recommended Netherlands. many people misusing them. mandatory public transport use different mask journey.

Then wash put enclosed plastic bag 72 hours.

Please use mask properly! thorough discipline touching it. Thank well thought reasoned correction post. Plus shared sources - winner. People military service get forced inject something government time.

And 'something' vaccine. allowed endanger public health times pandemic unless medical exception. Vaccines normally given though muscle teacher (not Texas) terrified I'll thrown house plagues month, honestly good hear. late save thousands infected, another lockdown could give Texas states chance ACTUALLY lock down, establish contact tracing expand PPE access.

Or they'll blow again. Death rate lags weeks behind infections, we'll see end month. I've always though 3.28 million around number since feel like people least relatively care 100 people. maybe that's hopeful. Rural America single place. Many rural areas bracing surge. experience contradicts literally nothing article. ‚Äúhype‚Äù article. States can't even contact trace. Faith based quarantine, sure ""less stupid"" sure irony intended, laughed anyway. sarcasm Pure actually 100% right that. still misleading Swedish National News report Tldr? disease

It response outbreak *plague*. racism motivation, wanting see rerun Black Death part well. I'm hoping hospitalized get chance spread it. Perfectly balanced..

Maybe add president 25% IQ world leaders (Though comes integrity ethics we're single digits). Ok, understand. Thanks lot! +9478 Florida. Vince job. know Opossums almost immune rabies due low body temperature (94-97¬∞F) limits virus ability replicate.

There, (probably) know something new immunology possibly useless Sure, hence shift say. indicates still pursuing herd immunity. ""Continue oppressed, murdered police another couple years--now's time protest!""

This nonsense. 

We could end protests right instituting real reforms, choose to. emerald coast known beautiful beaches. lot summer destination weddings (it's hot balls get this). governors whose state colleges/universities SEC football conference peer reviewed study prestigious journal infectious diseases world, multiple PhD authors eminent peer reviewers. course, dude internet knows wrong, Donald Trump used talk particular drug.  impact, much people thought. [made yesterday another thread links news articles/a research article far demonstrated big influence things people expecting. another person said, outdoor transmission high thought, demonstrations even beaches *as* bad initially thought, still indeed cause little bit community transmission. cause sort significant superspreader spike, compared indoor gatherings. 10 days planned Orlando fall. sucks, we‚Äôre going anymore. 
How could anyone enjoy time constant worry? 
I guess answer people aren‚Äôt worried. honestly sounds like dream job sometimes. What's like whatever want probably still fine  remove title edited, interesting article none less mention might make till next year?? Lol That‚Äôs like blaming cell phone makers spread. Facebook viewed publishing tool individuals. shouldn‚Äôt hold responsible people put there, they‚Äôd start policing censoring people. really want world corporations start censoring monitoring free speech? believable one would makes extreme reaction new infection released half year later, would pretty darn evil. ridiculous straw man. realize people use rentals avoid lockdown, right? Many second homes? 

Well, instead moving goalposts every time someone links article, may suggest different approach? 

Why stop trying look loopholes pandemic? 16.5% positive Houston hospital... patients coming near dead, means others dying home. Could one reason death rate remaining steady. Gotta test count them.

You try sound like know talking about, think actually know spreads risks even around people knowing. Except, that's said.

He could said public wear homemade mask, didn't.  COVID Act warns ""if trend continues, [both states] **may eventually achieve herd immunity, though may take years.""**

What incredibly irresponsible comment. Immunity doesnt last years, according researchers. comment otherwise reputable organization gives denier's claims legitimacy, however false. vaccine works, mass vaccinate population europe/USA October, absolutely huge yet sounds like restrictions long haul. ""You always count Americans right thing ‚Äì they‚Äôve tried everything else."" No, average takes 5 days show symptoms 18.5 days pass away. CDC website. Oh, cool.

I‚Äôve celebrating already whenever kids across street start lighting fireworks 1 am. celebrating mean creeping around yard dark, making bizarre demonic gibbering noises get scared go inside.

You know get COVID they‚Äôll come back ‚ÄúI everything right, don‚Äôt understand happened‚Äù well Sorry, thought discussing current events 2020, things happening 1970's.

Ironically , proving point. brining precedent business brought reason justify something new totally different world landscape. use ""undocumented"". Oh CNN... cool, moving on...  ü§£ü§£You need counseling fearü§£ü§£ black folks least understand concern since historically history getting experimented shady ways ended fucking over(just look Tuskegee experiments see mean) No, haven't, better answer couple PMs revile dare questioned someone's assertion blind. Thanks. Tremendous. Truly BIGLY. always, everywhere. Urgentcare (or Nextcare?) shows wait times. ones huge numbers huge lines places ""instant"" testing (and tiny handful those), several ones much wait. Depends go, too, course. media anecdote famous. enough longitudinal data yet make determination long term effects I've using since beginning. keep track quite bit breakdown state well. lot people don‚Äôt think 100k deaths lot. Yea, half planet lives $5.50 day , American give selfishness ignorance many fellow citizens . make incredible sacrifices acts kindness, don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not, toddler, in-laws late 70s see daily. I‚Äôm good time, need right now, won‚Äôt risk one getting sick dying 5 nights parties, pools drinks girls. talked already, I‚Äôm waiting Sept 1 make call whether cancel, article doesn‚Äôt spring much fuckin hope. problem half population think he's full shit Hopefully enough people decline move top list. think appropriate response lean HARD feds get shit together something, say, ""welp, feds wanna help, guess go ahead exponential growth case numbers!"" answer that--Canadian lived USA past two years.

The world laughing country, want put bucket 'stupid' get judged. Everyone know USA there, visa horrified what's happening. Saying American patriotic country disgrace compared USA right now.

Sad true. Isn‚Äôt exactly hell works Simpsons? get smothered something ‚Äúgood‚Äù. wanna double wrong? Hopefully wake see body bags refrigerated trucks front local hospitals.

This virus probably infected people thru 4G signal killed brain cells.ü§î Yeah heard they‚Äôre mass producing test. heard it‚Äôs promising far! Every article come across gives December likely drop date could save Halloween would dope! I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs case. know, could've linked article people discuss it, look like raving loony. Nice! Ah yes. link page doesnt exist. Proves point completely always. It‚Äôs amazing much paperwork magically get deleted times like this. time new person gets infected, SETS NEW RECORD. useful. Tell us daily death numbers daily ICU patient counts daily hospitalization counts. numbers less useful describing current seriousness problem. Friend works there. Said illegal immigrants. single one speaks English. also said every one diabetes. exhale filthy diseased germs lungs public, believe also shit strangers' french fries public. testing revealed start lockdown, 2.6 percent population (73 people) positive SARS-CoV-2, couple weeks 1.2 percent (29 people) positive. times, around 40 percent positive cases showed symptoms (asymptomatic)

Just clear, consistently refer asymptomatic presymptomatic  one cares. House, led Dems, went vacation. Senate, led Repubs to.

Multiple states asked financial assistance, PPE, reagents, beds, vents.

And Pelosi McConnell's response push masks. can‚Äôt keep throwing stimulus money expanded UI forever. pay eventually higher taxes ...

See, understand now! deaths m, cases. don‚Äôt need test registered death.

Suspicion do. something even scarier: much subject medical professionals start deserting jobs. part military- continued participation medical services industry purely voluntary. Closing almost anything backed science. Problem think science bullshit. kid Fauci, nobody really locked down. know many people state(Illinois) working home deemed 'essential' go in. would cases lower? spreading exponentially states give damn anything it. That's... great. Yikes. mother nurse nursing home. would tell me, phone, first hand experiences like working admit recovering COVID-19 patients help alleviate already overwhelmed hospitals. 

The interesting thing patients dying much medical staff. Two mother's managers died, several staff members died floor alone - knowing mother turned 62, completely depressing me. 

With said personally, agree using nursing home beds recovering COVID-19 patients. NYHH (New York Health &amp; Hospitals) system utterly overwhelmed combined patients patients virus fire medical emergencies. Hospitals 90% capacity (again, epicenter) webeven resorted using refrigerated trucks temporarily store dead bodies families claimed / found place bury them. 

We even used mass graves bury hundreds bodies. horrible images see news tandem reports Trump saying ""disappear"". layover Orlando last week way back funeral. couldn‚Äôt believe packed airport flight were. many people flat weren‚Äôt wearing masks. terrifying. reduce data usage? amp pages less data? actual host stop making bloated web pages fix that? Oh Jesus. Contact tracing via Instagram. frightening thought ther people voted vote him. Narrator: 'but take last chance'. realm

I've never heard put like that. day forward shall refer *unknowable realm*. Thank internet stranger. No, that's correct. browser fingerprint used associate platforms - Reddit Google. Looks like exponential growth arrived. near enough share, unfortunately. greater need moment, already running certain states.... FLORIDA. all.

The highest link GBS vaccinations 1970's, particular outbreak swine flu.

Even then, 1/100,000.

The rate modern vaccinations estimated 1/500,000 1/1,000,000, even then, link known causal, rather associated. likely get actual flu vaccine. flu might actually explain GBS, attenuated vaccine uses similar mechanisms instigating immune response.


A vast majority GBS cases caused bacteria, *Campylobacter jejuni* Yup, need remember fixate conclusions first, looking evidence. That's science done correctly since witch hunts Middle Ages. That‚Äôs fucking racist can‚Äôt close borders keep people out!!! lot courts ruled allow topless men must allow topless women.

Just lot people take court could. Erm...well, I'm advocating liquidating assets every billionaire. Bit strawman there.

A little bit taxing wealthy, little bit online purchase taxes (adding dollar tax singular online purchases would generate cost another stimulus one year), cutting military budget, stopping tax refunds year...that'd buy us good chunk change. 

And let's say enough generated two rounds stimulus packages....that'd buy us 8 months enhanced unemployment. I'd take that. seem dismissive attempt help fix problem, saddening. type crisis requires action, fatalism. 

And studied economics, think hand indefinite cash. studied logical fallacies? Call is: willful intentional lie. liars, deceivers, truth them. know matched patients adjusted age differences; see Kaplna-Meier survival curves figure 2.

Even making sure qualities equivalent groups including mean/median age, HCQ group showed significantly increased survival rate.

So indeed legit study. studies prior this, including one prompting stop trials, retracted due severe flaws methodology data collection. sub-par even terms number specialty authors involved. probably best HCQ study moment showing significant advantages. things need open running per normal, bars one them. always felt Brendan annoying unfunny loud mouth. Fuck guy. I‚Äôm guessing scientist isn‚Äôt front line hospital setting dealing real-time like doctors are. dame cdc said wear masks? point findings consistent reality. seemed set off, sorry bringing up. ran 12 miles, need tell go enjoy beautiful day. would done anyway. Keep living bubble covid flu (.2% ifr). know much about, include - felt two would reason enough :p  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dire. Therapeutic treatment improved significantly since Italy even NYC. I‚Äôd wager Texas comes NYC deaths per million end 2020.

But nightmare ‚Äúprize‚Äù win. vaccine sent England first (20 million doses) since vaccine produced England. that, start producing US market. currently talks countries supply complete american production. us first half gonna lie provide family hotel room food necessities? vaccine public, Anti Vaxxers three choices, get vaccinated, pay alot money survive covid-19, die. know thought. went large group friends care people doing. Never understood reasoning behind way lied. could lied said bandanas/homemade masks effective, almost much N95s people would thrown bandana on. morons think spike cause it. Use Firefox part ""a vaccine coming available year"" think Trump literally *any* part less vile human less vile unelected officials less vile federal judge appointments less vile supreme court appointments would also able elected?

What part vaccine virus available September would lead compromise morals? expect Trump vote him?

I cannot fathom single answer would reconcile first hate Trump every fiber think he's made 150,000 far actually Again, knew science. People pointing science weeks.

He reversed opinion literally overnight.

It's someone said right combination things justify change Abbott. Public education particularily bad South decades. it‚Äôs bad NE places too, ... we‚Äôre paying Agreed. actually running FLorida already. totally get feel way. want hug... Good trying get councilwoman something community's safety! I'm California. statewide mandate put place weeks ago, everyone age 2 wear mask public, even outdoors social distancing possible.

Because mandate, feel like rare see anybody inside businesses without masks. work retail, rare see customers walk entrance without already masks on. We're empowered keep customers safe. unfathomable government, county otherwise, prioritize citizens's health safety, make excuses place that. Stupid people examine content proposed vaccine prior making choice. outdoor protests okay, outdoor concerts tubing? gonna drop bit holiday weekend. Next week fucked though. Tuesday Wednesday easily see 80,000+ cases backlog. Romans, British Isles consisted big island (Great Britain) little island (Ireland) Yep. People talking enough. heard there's 100% country infected already experience symptoms. can't prove naturally immune never produce antibodies, read facebook must true. already begun mass production btw.

As soon know vaccine works(end summer) start shipping doses. So, Tulsa told small crowd lots empty seats much testing bad optics slowed down. great news. keep wanting wake nightmare unfortunately wake nightmare getting started. everything power avoid infection, civic minded! Jesus Christ, dude.  never did. Heck even flattening curve keep hospital empty near surge happen, say low deaths. excuse downplay say flu. Oh god thought everyone did? Yeah maybe that‚Äôs I‚Äôm worried it, kids always take shoes too. forgot lot Americans don‚Äôt that... sure people keep traveling. tests day results so... elderly, diabetic, obese? not, go self quarantine get home. Ahhhh perfectly balanced, like everything be. I'M GOING FIX PROBLEM GET INFINITY SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! x Infinity Slippery slopes real though, slippery slope arguments automatically fallacies.

I'd say fallacious argue something logically follow ""if X, follows"", logically follow. example compare, ""if allow men marry men, also allow people marry dogs"" ""if allow men marry men, eventually become normal"".

Depending views, statements slippery slopes, one clearly fallacious.

Setting precedents real thing dismissing arguments slippery slopes fallacious itself.  get kind sticky megathread sub, ideally written verified scientists, that's sort FAQ common vaccine rumors, fears, pseudoscience crypto-antivax bullshit? also Mary Juant some? Sounds like typical Americans

Seriously. People want blame feds local government (both fuck large majority cases), short answer majority Americans fucking stupid. fact anyone uninformed/misinformed, seen full data across world says 'lol nah that's flu bro, I'm wearing mask!' proves it.

How hell anyone 'losing fear' virus that's quickly climbing peak? People incapable forgoing temporary comfort vices (restaurants, bars, movies, etc.) own/societies good. guess surprised though. I'm going bet lot root-cases people go every Friday payday blow hundreds weekend complain they're broke.

Rant over. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre gen z. Don‚Äôt call them. Text them. much speculation one way other. Right important thing wear mask aware serious disease. like rabies vaccination nature animals. Airdrop hidden treats stupid people like... They'll self vaccinate STUPID in-laws hell bent leaving Texas, driving Alabama, staying days play beach, pick wife kids COPD mother-in-law, head Destin week. Genius. 

Pieces shit aren‚Äôt taking kids. go die beach, they‚Äôre taking family them. He'd rather let people state die massive numbers chance right thing idiot supporters reelect him, mean? Trump cronies gutted grifted left right. Gutted federal agencies meant keep us safe.

I'm sure technology build wall great, erode Rio grande.

Puerto Rico still hurting. graft aid money. They're trying scapegoat PR leadership.

The F35.

The Boeing 777.

We still learning new things coronavirus even!

New products even built top old technology bugs. 

Ugh and.... Fucking hydroxychloroquine.... Yep. research. Like everywhere, there's good bad doctors/dentists. google reviews websites, too. I'm thankful county (Leon) mandated masks days ago. Still stop idiots wearing wrong, least there's mask usage general. Yes, please do. understand it, least two versions going around, original strand, mutated one. mutated one is, believe, contagious less severe. kind good news. Viruses typically mutate lesser severity rather stronger. Aaaaaand we‚Äôre going back school fall???? make rubbing alcohol aloe vera gel. much time misinformation websites? Im honestly super annoyed country way relaxed entire pandemic. ruined many lives entire country laughs yesterday's news. Im glad live live. really struggled affording food. we've started growing veggies alot able go hunting. generous people looking us too. Making sure OK. may earning much right now. least eat abit better unlike start this. Luckily us keep sustained awhile. Even then, know many people beginning denied tests ""too young"".

If 45, pretty much denied test unless went hospital economic damage also bigger mess time us full national lockdown due us sync Europe. They're slowly opening already spring &amp; successfully got situation control comparison. rest world take hit without us, too. IFR .009% (90 ppl million) ppl ages 20 49 really think we're going see spike? current cases 40. Crazy positive rates Brazil Mexico, too, 40%. That‚Äôs bad worst couple days NYC early (even cases peaked here) sustained weeks countries. Cases would probably much higher US testing rate. Trump liked must bad. anyone explain end game here? hoping vaccine going hide then? may actually run course society goes away....all dying things much higher rates normal (suicides, domestic abuse, drugs) yet deaths ignored attributed Covid. 
    happens vaccine fails? virus mutates becomes seasonal thing like flu? noone talking this? true Reddit fashion, vote follow herd mentality...but seriously whats end game people? loss. guys want added context is:

Disney employees unionized part agreement NBA WDW. NBA cannot force also quarantined. know plans regarding testing employees.

I say though, cast members young people, naturally socially active (like one cousins works company Orlando) living groups thing potential spread like wildfire.

I hope nothing bad happens. likely happen cases bubble, even daily testing precautions There's way there's going college football year. yes, ‚Äúyou think‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm totally convinced know everything relevant hospitals Florida Arizona Texas now! Thank god Casper supercharger opened! saved ass many hours driving around either direction.

What supercharger at? literally said America First broken caps, incivility? lol That's comment? actually suffer mental sickness? Want screenshot post ? Yea. back something familiar enough don‚Äôt question. banks come ‚Äúsave day‚Äù offering loans 7% make missed payments choice take offering. Big oil save day rolling green energy they‚Äôve working 25 years waiting till got every drop oil. Car companies roll fleets electric vehicles run back work living pay check paycheck pay them. enough change fool people thinking anything actually changed. 

I don‚Äôt know we‚Äôll end hope it‚Äôs somewhere better know sarcastic, serious economic argument Disney maximizes profits opening impose serious negative externality (cost) public. example market failure intervention government necessary. around 650 deaths per million around 400 deaths per million. Given current situation feel confident pass them. hope don't. sad truth research continuing, US longer access data results. China tell us came (if want too). donvote reality want. Coronavirus likes it. Yeah, you‚Äôre right - read fast. edited comment Exactly man. hate solution You‚Äôd reason make comment, stop feigning ignorance. You‚Äôre debate wizard calling logical fallacies, argument seem ignoring LTR situation. Thanks. tough time. Totally planned plans pandemic? I'm looking going appointments alone, probably birthing without family, cant decide better - get maybe pass immunity newborn none. Still trying work people cant even bothered wear mask Walmart. Sigh. #plandemic ""How operate"" causes misinformation, whole point article. mom works daycare program kids private school. 7 6pm.

She 57 4 preexisting conditions. open fall going die..... guaranteed. shitty school act like cared pray (it Catholic school)... tristate new jersey... fucked. Learning grieve brother Miami! Fun!

The whole country ""fun"". extrapolated bit much simple comments. 

He's saying man covid hospital, he's saying man's guardian decided hospice care therefore denied care hospital, article seems suggest/criticize. Still unverified Raps.org remove whole post. talking puerto ricos 100 percent az sure downvoted. wrong could case lot families, made good point older siblings taking responsibilities. could absolutely much them.

However, based way worded it, interpreted mean none kids getting work done. Merica almost broke 60k today. Go spend little peasants make economy great. lol astroturfing getting pretty desperate. [christian broadcasting network strange source cite ""left super easy get 2nd phone number phone. There's literally app that... downvoted hell? people go bed? worked NZ prove works cases 

14 days lock-down (or multiple this) pretty simple science based measure. know virus physically transmits air around infected people regardless symptoms. know infectious period lasts around 10 days. 

If infected person physical opportunities virus spread, going die without spreading - question could completely different variables idea contributed. ... low population density, example 

Yes, maintaining lock-down easier low population density. instance shared bathrooms, lifts public transport hard. New Zealand car culture (rather subways) helped. 

But also one strictest lockdowns high compliance, countries like Italy leaving home way early start taking credit idea even compared countries like Aus. 

Australia never really locked down. essentially went alert level 2 much testing. bragged low case counts.

It's easy sit NZ wonder lock-downs work elsewhere. look actual restrictions put place, pretty clear. nations long, strong clear lock-down affected entire population. never got widespread testing working. make possible sick people stay home.

Nations large complex, agree. US never really proper lockdown. Every state thing states opened way others did. unified approach rush reopen US would seen spike cases see That's April. Easter miraculously disappears. virus. They're working hard. Looks like April. 2 days month. punishment getting question wrong. every right-wing nonsense Fox News OANN teach

If country living organism, would auto-immune disease. Guys guys guys listen. state Florida wants become sick die.. say let them. I'm Montana employees people 70 wear mask, hardly anyone else. would estimate &lt; 30% at. guess got lucky, parents staunch conservatives, yet careful though this. Probably due years ago uncle brain injury never since, eventually needed plug pulled. recently dad got sepsis 92, thankfully beat it, take risks illness anymore. Bruh... Never ""both sides"" argument fallen flatter. Virginia ~6% positive statewide. Coronizona  Sorry bout shitty mom see Mongolia second-world country; group Mongolia Russia (second world) China (third world).

Mongolia embarrassing United States. idea second third worlds became obsolete 1991, Soviet Union fell. Therefore, second-world third-world status Mongolia can't source embarrassment 2020. wear N95s whenever treat every surface infected fine. Sanitize every thing wore brought going back house too. every one family that.

This coming someone lived housemate got diagnosed COVID get infected. Mystic Rick vulnerable sick people isolated (hopefully elderly sick sent resthomes - thanks Dems). really, *really* want go vacation, also want chance killing someone killing myself. Apparently, that's crazy-talk people lol.  *Georgia's holiday break testing entered chat* Nope.. holiday lol. btw probably make growth faster since started memorial day: ) Yeah. 

1. USA Boy, twist lol. literally made sense. Remember vote, President care people set beliefs? 
I many times change mind learn new things.. thought common sense like kind news I'm send son back school. operate assumption people read article article disproved title whole point won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm small sustained outbreak country inevitably spilled nursing homes despite actual monitoring. feels like matter time. sucks much. 

My family‚Äôs Pampa thank god take seriously, cause almost one Panhandle taking seriously. Glad see Texan supporting right criticize great state! I'd look something that's 100% cotton (you want anything stretchy like polyester), 2 3 layers, possibly filter pocket. distinction wanting something, accounting it. deaths declined outbreak North East dominated countries numbers, outbreak truly decline. fantastic news.

In meantime, outbreak slowly picking steam many states, months. Lots positives. Sounds like 10,000. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è cases ultra-rare ones!

When CoVid 99%+ people mild symptoms asymptomatic... unless parents die like case severely sickened need hospital care like case CoVid... going take seriously.

The percentage coming primary care physician Dr. Pondek Water's Edge Maryland, keeping issue like co-workers multiple CoVid patients.

I understand also people frustrated since locked home nearly 4 months saying ""We extend this!""

Honestly parents died severely sickened, would saying ""No... extensions lockdown! Masks fine, closing indoor dining fine, things fine lockdown!""

Right Florida, Texas blood colored states? need good lockdown get stuff control. available list countries received (donations purchased) remdesivir? Fake booms!  Shit, better get partying lol I'm working 25 oh totally agree lockdown till vaccine unrealistic people's mental health economically speaking. mean eventually need find sort normality since virus us while

But reopening soon also good idea see Florida Texas reopened early seeing huge spike cases. Compare NY NJ reopen early they're ok even look European countries like Italy never rushed reopening fine. Texas waited longer reopen probably situation today Probably both...sort of. Kids seem next symptoms. you‚Äôve ever spent time kids, usually complain extensively coughs fevers. people lose sense smell days. people symptoms two weeks start fever coughing, transmissible. 

They call anyone symptoms mild enough never bother getting tested skip work asymptomatic. Could retrospectively ask person specific questions find symptoms? Yeah, times. ‚ÄúAsymptomatic‚Äù lacks medical definition. No, he's mad governor's number fixing operation working 15 years ago media reported college kids rainbow parties. 30 years ago satanic ritual parties.

Its possible happening, media bad record reporting whats kids ""these days"". likely moral panic either isolated occurance hoax. h/t Peak Prosperity People get tests, far AZ testing goes anyway. live Arizona. Last went test, got hour. poor neighborhoods long wait times cars, get test without symptoms. friends get tested every week mandated job. fact tests, available anyone, coming back 25% scary hell. Penn State grad student here, I'm scared go back scary honestly. We‚Äôre eventually going 100k cases day, unbelievable 1971 moved upstate NY Los Angeles. excited learn Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger TV) lived across street! It‚Äôs treasured memory 50 years. it‚Äôs ruined. Unenforced mandates absolutely help.

Here Nevada maybe 25% mask wearers stores. 90%+.  say - decision hold rally one dumbest political decisions seen long time. saying Independent swing voter. cannot believe stupid enough let thing happen. disasterclass Good thing you‚Äôll never grow old become unimportant. chances pretty decent never ""lockdown"" March, U.S. problem now. Instead ""locking down,"" selfish New Yorkers flew across country -- spreading disease -- could ""quarantine"" Miami, Los Angeles, Palm 

do evidence happening? talk research implication research crowd favorite among main visitor group site.. 
 
what implying ? Yep, guy. Per capita, France Italy Spain deaths world. aren‚Äôt ideals follow. sickest vulnerable died (mostly nursing homes). Spain France, elderly dying alone nursing homes. disease ripped Europe. initial thought could mandated masks(As well distributing them) fine people adhering rules fact jurisdiction throws window. Unfortunately, can't trust people right thing given option opt-out since wearing mask become political. mike ponce actually followed guidelines got control. Unlike US bunch cultists running around complaining said guidelines infringing ""freedums"" get everyone else sick. Yup...I saw friend post ""Well, Obama one actually went killed Osama Bin Laden I'm giving credit."" longer friends. Remember this? 

&amp;#x200B;

This criminal. never trust anymore. political issue, fact issue. trust Koreans scientists rather None regulars whining lockdowns, social distancing, masks, etc. spreading conspiracy theories pandemic part nonexistent gun grabbing campaign? apparently asymptomatic carrier infected 8 people city alone, maybe go back drawing board at, planning mixed model 50% kids coming M-T , wednesday cleaning, 50% students come TH-Friday. rest online. parents seem outraged DARE force children wear masks. Might well online, u think kids listen parents r telling to, mocking usage masks... No, lockdown vaccine available. option, never option, never option. health official, government official, reasonable person thinks viable even possible. stop suggesting it. ain‚Äôt happening. I'll get shot like got flu shot every year. think people going protected everybody else gotten shot. virus still around, means likely hit harder it. shot, end taken it.

It works flu shot. get shot. protects getting serious strain flu, gotten it.. End getting hit hard it. Pre-symptomatic symptomatic. People still feeling good spreading around question matters is...
For better worse severity? areas. need stop thinking US single country regard Covid-19 response. Plenty cities states still taking seriously giving up. Free them. support people going celebrating year, think situation already screwed protests/riots? think one day celebration make people drop like flies, think weeks protesting/rioting going do? Rape? That's Rushmore right there. people criticize social media owners social media companies? hot RN make US pay it? /s holiday weekend celebrate birth country. whole life proud USA. feel nothing disgust incredible stupidity selfishness assholes caused us among worst world handling pandemic, led course asshole chief. left despair country's future. feel beginning end country. story June longer accurate. Abbott death process Yes. Hahaha, you‚Äôre suggesting referring byline comment article rather topic article? OK. 

Honestly true really need qualify statements, isn‚Äôt normal comment article actually speaking another topic. 

I nothing say Pfizer study. Like article. God pissed, god loves singing. woman desk almost laughed gave reason virus.

As far I'm concerned, allowed Karen cases.

When call customer support issue, go knowing customer service rep problem. help problem. company policy prevents helping, that's fault either. treat utmost respect.

But first time deviate company policy treat less human, gets reciprocated. became part problem, I'm going act like Karen. Numerous people area Maryland nowhere near Bloods saying ""Grandma Grandpa say bleep home, let us young people live lives wish to!""

Once again: people nowhere near Bloods. ones right across street dyed-in-the-wool Boy-Booties-colored saying that.

Guess what? also Boy-Booties-Colored elderly parents agree them. media agenda. They're thing GF protests. Divide conquer. SERIOUS inequities injustices society need serious attention. media works goal. check excessive bood clothing? May nothing, issue common covid survivors easy treatable blood thinners (after seeing professional course). see getting worse schools reopen. doesn‚Äôt seem like school systems taking seriously. PPE, social distancing, etc. weak security theatre. Fall early 2021. Read article wrong them?

I suspect it‚Äôs long list root cause complete selfishness Basically business usual ¬¢apitalist America. Uncle Fedya always goat grew PRIDE. Thanks saying something reasonable. Texas Health officials say Hispanics disproportionately getting sick dying disease.

Texas' population 40% cases skyrocketing among communities outbreak worsens throughout South West, caseloads growing fastest counties large communities color. need. good day. ""no evidence human human infection"" ohhh buddy... vaccine likely least risky. definitely way ever going come control leadership let get hand. Perhaps send kids parents must physically go work back school, live stream lessons/Skype kids stay home parents working home. can‚Äôt say nah aren‚Äôt school person year. Im anti trump much anyone comments getting cringy. knew this. Smart people avoid bars. Smart people avoid enclosed spaces room people. Smart people avoid places one wearing masks. 

But morons believe real, believe flu, believe ways slow transmission, believe one big hoax political reasons. Dude results people getting tested today come nest day likely. Probably even longer. numbers see today backlog days prior. patriot act terrible comparison. public safety issue. might well argue seats belts infringement freedom. It‚Äôs bullshit. That‚Äôs case slippery slope argument logical fallacy.

The rest comment isn‚Äôt worth response. ironic you‚Äôre accusing stretching argument. live dallas. know 6 members best friends fam got infected yesterday 2 sisters tested positive. one's arguing COVID can't spread protests, spread anywhere. real question rate spread much concerned. science COVID proven spreads efficiently indoors cold temperatures close contact likely, hence outbreaks bars, meatpacking plants, dorms. 

Surprisingly, COVID spreads easily schools households well people might assume. proven time time again, outdoor activities cause outbreaks rate indoor spaces, even absence mitigation efforts like masks distancing. 

This much case certain people wanting COVID omnipresent omega virus, desires backed research legitimate science. mention people hypocritical beachgoers absolutely right reasons mentioned. people got COVID beach? Undoubtedly. people got COVID protest? Absolutely. However, one two people catching COVID outdoors ***not*** equal likely catch COVID outdoors. thinking 28 Days later I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true, problem is, one earliest symptoms fever many people don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre walking around fevers. welcome take grain salt wish, could certainly asked symptoms experience telling I'm basically mouthing off. :) Giggity. never read comments youtube videos. Thank sharing this. theory like rich parents raising spoiled brats. wonder how, happens time.

greatest generation turned US powerhouse, kids/grandkids/etc spoiled brats. Ehhh, story weeks ago retracted statement. sub enjoys hysteria fear much, I‚Äôm surprised mods haven‚Äôt removed something vaccine related swear it‚Äôs like rich want eaten. Wait really side American exceptionalism coin: countries it, can't. US gonna die arrogance. someone works PF fucking HATE explaining bullshit involving contract. hate kind gym contract, fucking racket make dig mother law's corpse cancel.

Physical fitness basic aspect life gym memberships OBSCENELY fucking simple. X amount every month, boom. That's it. Cancel anytime, writing fucking letter like 1865 coming personally, none horseshit. designed keep customer honestly makes sick think lol Risky? think ChAdOx vaccine yearly one. mechanism delivery clear limitation: delivered virus. 

It's virus humans get (or very, very, humans gotten) one causes disease humans, still trigger immune response. vaccine delivered, start making antibodies vaccine delivery mechanism itself. presents complication subsequent administration challenged immune response. ""Boosters"" may work all. Wooo mask club! left North Carolina list. Weekends see lower numbers point prioritize vaccines current hot spots, treating areas production distribution ramps up? getting voted more? Disappointing since would hide totally uninformed opinion. recommended? so, I‚Äôve social distancing thing wrong, far. That's hate College kids, man. get older, stay age. American Exceptionalism indeed Nobody really knows. New York unique fact pretty early on, dense city is, much people rely public transit.

In lot big cities America, commuting often done people solo cars. 

I think end little bit hyperbolic. think get bad cities, extremely bad. AMP loads CSS? load external stylesheets, excluding fonts. bit custom fonts wrong, unfortunately.

Also, AMP supports ads. Also, AMP supports custom JavaScript using custom things, load 3rd party JS iframes. I'm sure put images wherever like AMP page.

Sure, I'd wager average AMP page less data average non-AMP page. saying normal website can't achieve speed data usage conscious designed. Tfw live corporate feudalism. remember one doctors one daily press conferences say took years usually get vaccine bit could everyone worked together common cause could possible sooner would way anytime sooner 18 month. trials fact cant speed time..This guy glasses US. one changes mind regarding wearing masks.. cant remember name..
When saying vaccine going ready? Love this. nothing ever changes technology never improved. I'm Oakland went Target day quite people wearing around necks chins, covering nose one see most. also see lots people bars front patios mask. Plus people large parties weekend. invited know take seriously. again? Literal child government's job greedy corrupt bastards.

FTFY tell guy pretty clueless lot things

Joe first person would agree that. don‚Äôt know yet. Right now, it‚Äôs recommended even people antibodies take precautions it‚Äôs proven antibodies prevent reinfection, long last. Vents seem slowly getting phased less intrusive methods oxygenating blood, I'm sure they'd able preform procedure either since also requires special equipment. However, think center going used non-ICU patients free room ICU hospitals. heavily depend staffing. Reporting often done weekends holidays weird reason due respect: requirement private business thing, somewhat based local health laws.

Although localities like Ocean City 'vacation towns', businesses much lax 'no shoes, shirt, service'.

Numerous times young, literally saw people walk businesses Speedos  
and flip-flops served. thing regarding climate change. information people like, yell ""FAKE NEWS"" somehow become serious rebuttal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è go raised hell claimed getting refunded well. find wording bit mysterious know many recovered patients little immunity low antibodies none all! So, real question is, vaccine prevent infection? study monkeys indicate does. MAY reduce severity, proven. See witch excerpted article: 

""Similarly, key question current Oxford trials whether vaccine protect individuals becoming infected simply make less ill. Researchers also working may also work less well older people due weaker immune systems.""

So, even article stating might work older people (i.e. risk) prevent infection (and therefore spread) still trying understand helps terms making ""less ill"". short, LOT questions efficacy thing... Perfectly healthy perfectly normal. Move along citizens explore data here, interesting: masters domain. actually lived boonies kid, everyone drove town issue. Rural areas aren‚Äôt exactly high-risk virus areas anyway. might able guess use brain. ""Freedom's another word nothing left chew"" means time control people possibly antibodies. They're still studying level antibodies need (somewhat) immune, kid participates study.

Yeah respond quickly enough here, spread many got infected. died, others face long recovery.

But *right now* control, tests readily available, ICU's normal capacity etc. peak measures prevent another. 

I'm sure issue right according you. real shame idiots country managed wipe out...

A real shame Check covid tracking project especially want process data. whole API constructing URL type query, state name, date.

Do think hold accountable disparage group? Oh yeah that's I'm saying need move right direction stop whatever next steps containment. Says 44k right now. I‚Äôm familiar historical aspects rushed vaccine development, within US (with $ driven health care system) see two things arising 2020:

1. COVID complications/lingering effects (eg lung issues) causing issues insurance coverage road and/or new signups for, say kids covered parents get future

2. Vaccine complications arising far line (similar things like Rx drugs ‚Äúsafe‚Äù determined cause cancer *x* years) also leading issues medical insurance coverage, turn either ruining people keeping tied work long last traditional retirement age.

My understanding given early, cuts hospitalisation rates.
There indian study (and moroccan one underway, gave everyone enough data).

It doesn‚Äôt jack shit administered early on, implies early testing, either randomly contact tracing.


Even effect, politicization drug resources/energy poured studies weirdo France falsified study might cost us lot time prevented us discovering something better. ""Good luck that"" says group unfettered, at-will access quality medical care, daily testing, drugs PPE could ever need families, ways pay hospital bills (if ever actually get any). Oh, jobs financial security. turn tables I'm teacher here. Blows mind maybe teaching entire year home sucks morons claiming freedom wear mask stolen freedom everyone else. 

Places people cooperated already returning nearly normal life. US it‚Äôs clear stuck mess either get virus vaccine. players slaves.

 Even think hoax whatever, least agree problem debatable magnitude. want whole thing behind asap zero resistance practicing simple distancing ppe guidelines. Otherwise part problem. crazy Joe epidemiologist Michael Osterholm podcast early pandemic telling serious COVID-19 was. Rogan started ignoring advice later treated like joke. worked field point 2, never stated got flu vaccine; cannot get way. stated worst *illness* thereafter, resulting side effects including fever nausea (though muscle soreness). 

As first point, it‚Äôs think works... it‚Äôs everyone else thinks it‚Äôs going work. Perhaps look headlines - article - show majority people think call doc drive office jab. Parts Texas probably going shelter place get spread control. warned late Feburary. Dr Bruce Alward talked briefing ECMOs rest world per hospital compared Chinese We‚Äôd go hospitals many ventilators have? 50, 60. scale we‚Äôre used thinking of. you‚Äôd ask many ECMO systems have? thought, seriously, you‚Äôre going ask ECMO?

Yes. sounds horrible. I'm glad road recovery.

What's blood type? Probably could kept economy going many deaths followed common sense beginning; wear mask, social distance, etc. Still plenty Americans don‚Äôt seem able grasp concept. small town Texas family. amount fuckers still ""the flu kills people"" bullshit fucking astounds me. mother fuckers went ""all lives matter"" people die time really fucking quick. Oh well, least good Christian folk. tried outdoor bars areas Arizona. bars packed people. Literally &amp; numbers. Outside activities, like tubing river issue.

Costco place around enforcing masks, place go. going work. takes one person fuck up, level many people think rules apply them, someone fuck up. late fragile.

A French citizen New York last month welcome Italy. Listen Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County‚Äôs health officer: ‚ÄúThis virus proven time again, communities around country around world, come back vengeance let guard down.

If kids infecting adults would 5-10 infections among kids adults. Instead infection rate basically one kid infected every 2 adults. build god dam wall, keep corona spreading gringos say hell despite whether hell real not, protestant history US casts long shadow country goes far beyond use language things like work ethic. Stop le enlightened atheist. [Ways get around part smart campaign open economy convincing people big deal.

Also masks look bad people might want spend don‚Äôt want kids understand risk everyone else. trying pass shitty genetics. 

Less jokes, hope vaccine safe all. I‚Äôm stating first line see risks vaccine much less risk covid individual self.

For awesome country America , cant wait see vaccine won‚Äôt get politicized like masks roll won‚Äôt complete idiotic mess like mask debate was. understand missing people, understand people could desperate they're willing risk death it.

Fuck it. Stay home, grill hot dogs, watch National Treasure, enjoy getting sick. No, actually totally dismiss pseudo-science without actual science yourself. know good news, cynical part hates face places rejected science, rejected compassion, rejected common courtesy, going saved vaccine. Everywhere else put effort stopping spread, assholes (who survived) get go living world actions consequences. Sure, still anti-vaxers culled arrogance/ignorance, millions people intentionally made things worse face consequences. like different types people on. usually learn something listening. 

Admittedly, seem like care happens response show ... that's kind like it. feel like, whether he's hosting Alex Jones Cornell West, I'm going hear extended convo straight source without editing spin. agree guests, sometimes agree Joe, conversation diverse welcomed shift platforms. 

Serious question (no hate here.) makes think Joe dumb? (He sound pretty smart me, even though tell he's less educated issues poor people.) time welcome President Biden. Can't make inject like places making test put stuff shelf, yeah that's pretty good idea staff work. Would help maintaining distancing since preferred cars ironically keep us socially separate. person thinks that's weirdly cheap?

Given deal tons airport/TSA bullshit charter, given people would bought first class commercial tickets otherwise (and first class come clean air supply separate coach), absolutely ""cheap"" get private experience.

like money fly first class Italy back, group 15 similarly well-moneyed people, chartered flight seems obvious choice.

Now, REAL issue thinking rules border somehow play money. That's assinine looks super shitty disconnected reality, i'm glad work. I'm sure assumed could bribe way problem, Italian officials normally easily bribed developed nation standards (it's still easier bribe people China India Mexico, bribe way thru LOT Greece Italy.) would never go one states help out. hit freight train nothing could do, chose bars mask fights. quite willing let stew selfishness. numbers nothing see near future. Sad. held really state less two weeks ago? wonder helped increase number. need go lockdown. Now. Legend started NYC peaked around 10k per day likely closer 30k.

You mean New York State, NYC?! broadcasted today r/angryupvote

...üòí thought thought may get whole ""murica"" angle act like brigade every sub anyway. Nice article! 

The concept R-value heterogeneity works better realizing spreading stopped, e.g. term 'superspreader'.

Imagine R-value spread heterogeneously among individual people: e.g., nine 10 people infect one person, one ten infects ten others. situation wide-spread mask wearing general public really matter. Mask provide chance lower amount people superspreader infects - offer nine chances entirely break chain infections superspreaders.

Wear masks, may far effective told. I‚Äôm grateful mask mandate. alone going save tens thousands lives. don‚Äôt think hit level chaos currently worst affected states. I‚Äôm sorry COVID; sounds brutal based current research it. Aside said previously, wear mask reason do. over, though circumstances could better everyone taken seriously. physician, I‚Äôd imagine front row seats disaster. sounds trite, thank do. Hopefully patients good making world better place due treatment. Hope get negative. I'm similar position waiting test results. mask likely fine! starting believe sensory issues far widespread previously assumed. That's way makes sense me. stand behind anything..his words live tv. vacation people. I'm defending understand people mentally strained naturally want they've always done relieve stress. Socializing common powerful way that, especially starved long period. Add ""endless"" feeling lot people saying fuck they're tired. 

This natural human reaction. mentality bad US mental health support, education, luxury, general lack faith government. This. thought knew people sudden they're talking ""Elon Musk using Star Link rain 5G us spreading covid...."" Really? People know real life. glad get weirdo stays home see anymore. Biden voters worried exposing infection (and infecting others). Oh offence taken also think it‚Äôs unfair US would get vaccines say loads people flouting quarantine countries (mine includes) who‚Äôve locked months everything could prevent spread. roles reversed think we‚Äôd deserve get vaccine first? 

Personally think poorer countries get vaccine first majority people can‚Äôt even afford basic medical care anyone risk probably left die without vaccine. filter upwards means quarantine lot better developed countries. 

However absolutely think anyone risk group first get vaccine regardless country live really hope family one first receive one becomes available üôÇ stay safe I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre stuck people putting first Likely red hat part town bad bad news.

If symptoms following 14 days, stop isolating

If symptoms test positive isolate 7 days since symptoms started

If symptoms test negative need keep isolating original 14 days period pass. 

What reason behind isolating getting negative test result? data regarding effective test different day count since contact person positive test result ? friends work hospitals arent afraid lives. afraid screw infect someone else die it. bring home spread it. idiots dont get afraid people dying halls ER diverting ambulances room. people suffering postponed surgery surgeries hospitals afraid fill case surge.

Noteworthy it‚Äôs less effective taken later primary benefit reducing viral spread given early. hey, non partisans looking treatments right? Right? could number one one liberal stats like education life expectancy particular law says cannot knowlingly infect HIV unprotected sex? get punished could avoid using protection. way punish spread COVID could avoid/minimize risk wearing mask. Amazing it‚Äôs possible look info up! They‚Äôve indeed Italy back! entire world stopped something that's dangerous? Well shit let's forget vaccines go there. Nothing worry right? /S

The problem science support claiming least bit, spouted psy- ops antivax bullshit talking about. always sound pants head crazy, times propaganda really subtle. mouse requires human sacrifices. Drive thru stations like drive thru testing stations weird one seems blaming protests.

My area weeks protesting, numbers roof. like choose acknowledge it.

Weird interesting seeing birth idiot live. People simply take high enough levels. seen surveys put refusal rate third, multiple articles said 25% people take vaccine ever. 

And matter good is, like flu vaccine needs done yearly, welcome COVID World everyone, here. Okay, here's question: still want gym things open ready go back? yes, expect happen keep paying they're closed? stay business? 

My gym Planet Fitness, 3 months god they're close house want think safe go back. keep charging me. fact flew Birmingham international afterwards... ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ Ever seen sci-fi dystopian film Children Men?

TX FL excess deaths (100%) places high COVID deaths show excess deaths like NY/NJ/Conn article looking narrow window time, get natural variations. Wait see full year impacts. weren‚Äôt. didn‚Äôt ask participation trophies. shit ton us emotionally abused neglected boomer parents. 

You raised us. take accountability. sure added /s. needed, could probably would that. ""I'm big blaming victim, but... [blames victim]""

We always need sort law enforcement react truly violent domestic violence situation progress, constitutes small fraction now. agree. Though that‚Äôs anecdotal evidence well.

To put perspective, NY alone many tests less 3 days get apportion blame reward. 

The average person doom scrolling medical training gets news television newspaper may well shocked.  told time open up. means everything normal. know that's case know that's case. unless keeping eye whole time indeed moving fast.  seems entire pandemic slow motion disaster built lot quick moving incidents.

I'm sure people spiking states distance wear PPE maybe lowers R0 bit compared March NYC. Also, doctors experience draw from, potentially reducing overall mortality rate. hand, NY locked fuck firm majority people got board masks distancing. seems much resistance currently spiking states. *You know what...we nice, going order pizza....

That means younger people goes way lower fact yes. young people actually dangerous flu.

Inconvenient them. Instead facing reality situation, working together combat problem think flu, something government control. 3000-15000 flu deaths per year count way count COVID deaths. CDC's ""estimation"" basically consists taking actual number, quadrupling it, announcing new number flu deaths.

Take care Obama could given coherent speech cut back testing would less cases. sad read side world. insidious virus, stopped. US could get together stop arguing whether coronavirus hoax masks destroy freedom, lock fuck 4 weeks, eliminate spread reduce numbers manageable level. Italy many countries runaway infections shown done.

Sort shit America. world watching. Indian propaganda. mixed-race Indian, government propaganda.

The government already caught lot shit they've handled virus, probably trying put fires build patriotism reason. Yea friend saying cant wait go las vegas party lolll

In ear, ‚Äúi cannot wait die!‚Äù Better it'll month doesn‚Äôt mean people listen wear masks. idiots like Lt Gov, Ted Cruz, etc downplaying wear masks. jest many Australians still social issues. must kids  Agreed Soon, Florida, soon I'm impressed US completely destroyed us europeans, 743 million, much densely populated... 


Way go USA! ^(This situation sucks) mean documentary? agree. Reddit bad. general media general really making protests seem safe arent.

It's overall really government's fault passing laws tho. US citizens feel like hostages maybe trapped burning dumpster? Yes, population density one key driving factors behind death infection rates. see Belgium's population density per square kilometre 15 times higher USA... Despite that, there's huge difference per capita death rates.

If USA population density Belgium, could expect death rates astronomically higher.

So like caution going infection rates alone, would caution comparing USA death rates far densely populated countries.

Also:

I like sushi I‚Äôm cheap don‚Äôt developed palate. haven‚Äôt really high-end sushi sushi happy hours pretty standard. 

My thing much food bland (including Thai, Chinese, ramen) compared Texas. Everything toned - little spicy really, Sichuan numbing, sad hint vinegar sad hint lime. Things aren‚Äôt much under-salted generally under-seasoned. 

The famous/popular Chinese place Din Tai Fung weirdly bland upscale overpriced trash. really good places (I like Harbor City dim sum, Rocco‚Äôs pizza, Hot Cakes dessert) Vietnamese really solid. 

But love Asian food (all cuisines) expecting mind-blowing Gourmet Dumpling experiences everyday. seek almost everything disappointing.

But generally, feel food Texas flavorful. Seattle uses quarter lime Texas chef would use entire lime. got actually stat? Like percentage... Sweden responded faster preemptively virus Us much smaller developed herd immunity

No haven‚Äôt. around %7 population COVID antibodies. Herd immunity requires %90+ population antibodies virus.

Swedes following social distancing less strict guidelines COVID still hit harder countries around strict guidelines. immediate proximity appears possible modes transport appear much likely total moron. idea got high world around 10m..or almost 11m confirmed now.

I wonder real numbers though. many people it, never tested. Whether asymptomatic, light symptoms..they'd never get tested.

I'd wager around 100m+ cases worldwide. positive rate increasing probably doubling. 15% positive rates means probably X10 cases lot controversy second wave Covi-19 states Texas, California, New York contagious.

Yes, think bad least now. freedom Deaths state 25 49 age bracket 4.10%. zero I'm sure families miss them. Unless northeastern states begin actually quarantining travelers hot spots - telling self quarantine, taking hotel keeping guard 10-14 days, soon states union track contain anything... agree that, many countries Europe actually grew closer together exercised empathy around, especially health workers.

And asian countries like South Korea well.

It really sad view differences States rest developed nations, see different president would change anything. live Pluto

I say ""false"". comes concept ""infectious dose"" applicable SARS, MERS, influenza, is, less virus ingested, resulting illness less severe. mask, long impedes virus ingested would protect wearer.    
It quite clear, countries *manufactured* masks said would work. S. Korea shut exports order outfit people masks. Meanwhile, countries domestic manufacturing capability make masks partaking hogwash disastrous results. Mask wearing countries well countries wear masks poorly. went article came out.        
Knocking virus ingested would reduce need respirators need hospitalizations. mask working well enough knocks things 10%. I'm hearing 50%.    
This lying masks par Vietnam Iraq(2003). LoL funny username guy reply That's exactly mean though... people getting wake-up call just... won't. Sorry feel way, bro. Hope swell rest night Sweden significantly lower death rate countries implemented strict policies Spain, France, England, Italy.

And developed herd immunity point COVID-19 longer anything beyond rounding error total death tolls national level. 

Isn't goal?

Edit: Downvote disagree button; ""this post contribute conversation"" button Honestly visited Huntsville last year kinda nice. understand, 40 year olds 1 500 chance death. wrong. figure correct, that's high. many survivor permanently impacted? dangerous illness. :-D thanks, happy cake day Wow im 33 first time iv seen sharticles said fuckin hate it, used twice one comment im going bed Darwin 5. person person driving alone passengers part household driver;

You know queen doesn‚Äôt rule anything right? commonwealth countries don‚Äôt take orders UK. People realize bad numbers are. 

In Canada, 501 cases day. got virus time US, have/had lot international travellers entering country, actually handled pandemic really poorly (had lot death long term care facilities). 

The US 10 times size Canada terms population. comparable new case rate would 5,000 cases. yet, US 55,000 new cases. per capita basis, US rate infection **ten times** Canada. 

There's literally justifying that. special. locked late party masks big time. sort bare minimum plenty idiots social distancing properly. yet, US **exponentially** worse point. 

I think US citizens realize batshit crazy management pandemic country. Canada managed great, look like Einstein-level geniuses compared US. Pandemic exploding? Postpone election.

A little Wizard Oz humour eh ! fucking dolt. nothing ""inconvenient facts"" everything lack empathy.

Fuck percentage, death toll devastating. stadium earth 130,000 people, act like digging 130,000 individual graves small task.

The attitude carry thing that's causing death toll tick higher. 

And comparing black plague. Really guy?! talking time people shat bathed drinking water source? course there's going deaths 1300's hygiene etiquette. 

If noticed health knowledge evolved leaps bounds since then. use modern standards.

We lost 3,000 lives 9/11, devastating tragedy modern standards, take shoes airport arrive hour early so. 

Let's show respect, put mask, follow social distancing 130,000 lives lost far instead poo pooing situation.  knew Americans generally entitled, arrogant stupid, doubt struggle virus.

But thought thousand deaths, American wake things work together efficiently get things control.

My expectation, learn, astronomically high Americans entire sentiment people won‚Äôt okay long run unfounded claims people fine long run. viruses don‚Äôt cause long term damage hate armchair epidemiologists pushing narrative. Okay, Trump Quite right. People looking excuses take shortcuts so-called leaders gave them. People common sense knew lie stayed safe. rest drank Kool-Aid. are. Trouble is, state‚Äôs‚Äò achievements stake states‚Äò incapability get spread virus control...so, choices ‚Äösmart‚Äò states have? imagine uproar state borders getting closed? honestly, options?

In Europe, also faced lack unified response fortunately got shit together managed harmonize unify measures across country borders, yet, response far away perfect, sufficient get certain state control.

You know. one trump gutted, promising needed could get back (but reason back) America stupid collectively politicised basic disease prevention unacceptable attack childish absolute privilege anything.

The situation hopeless. Americans stupid live. Literally. dying like flies, every bit preventable. way Florida fudged numbers? God, that's horrible. guessed wrong. trying say doctor nothing it. Wrong again. also one strictest lockdowns high compliance  anecdotal rather factual.

Love see priorities lie.  sure BNO sourcing data Worldometers reporting similar figure, without Los Angeles numerous large counties Texas. COVID-19 update: Let's check Sweden, country never lockdown thing &amp; asking people wear masks.

COVID deaths past week: 32. 

How happen? ""public health experts"" &amp; epidemiologists told us entire nation would flames now. hyping big drop tomorrow joking? Even took measures now, would still double least two weeks, no? 10,000 20,000 cases starting plateau.and slowly decrease. INSANE. FL Governor go prison. Clearly it‚Äôs church gatherings major battle now.

Unfortunately it‚Äôs damned damned don‚Äôt situation wasted first lockdown back square one...and you‚Äôve lost social contract people social distance.

There certain amount time social distancing began erode...because face of, social animals..,and wasted time Data argument. need context. link none. repeat, hard hit countries mortality wise peak winter times. southern hemisphere hit hard, winter times.

Username guy replied to. grades extracurriculars somehow better measure critical thinking? seriously believe grades extracurriculars fair poor kids? fact extracurriculars entirely based wealth.

You absolutely correct saying political psychological issue, unfortunately think science going change that. Congratulations florida. matter hard try, us Texans cant compete.

Slow loading, popups, ads everywhere, 30 seconds already trying get info. national geographic... That‚Äôs nothing, girl ride like Uber. sounds hopeful, sadly regular anti-vaxxers people making political, at-risk people unable get vaccine continue vulnerable LONG time.

He‚Äôs great job damn it‚Äôs lot work. it‚Äôs temporary!!! won‚Äôt reality forever! People want pretend everything fine won‚Äôt! don‚Äôt know celebration, long term progress... probably. hate cynical, generation currently running American society clearly failed, happens generation also susceptible COVID-19.

Just stating is. Definitely happy anybody dying, think there‚Äôs case made it‚Äôs downsides. Progress always happened death unfortunately. example though of:

""The exception confirms rule""

&amp;#x200B;

The rule being: young people survive corona 99% cases.

These reports newsworthy, *especially because* they're exceptional.

Unfortunately, also wrongly communicate message young people high risk dying it. Can't hire contact tracers much government costs much

Small government better everything ass Several law enforcement organizations throughout state, including Attorney General‚Äôs Office, said won‚Äôt enforce Kelly‚Äôs order.

Amazing people sworn uphold law pick choose laws want enforce! RIP Kansas, governor tried save spit face! I‚Äôm glad understand. thought little slow looks like starting get it.  studies look saying saying thing. article rubbish. Flatten curve laudable goal prevent given city's hospitals overrun. Still happened. flattened much lockdown/masks/distancing we're dragging out, delaying achieving herd immunity. yet people like still calling ""real action""? Stop assuming anyone disagrees care people - way dehumanize dismiss arguments. care believe we're wrong. US manages find worst possible middle ground, saving noone still destroying economy process. Well Florida many oldsters. They're living long yuuuuge burden system. think money saved croak! billionaires get even bigger tax breaks. protesters gathered responsibly 

I love jokes. Back real world, no, happen. New talking summer estate, winter estate, pied terre Geneva? ""Why need wear seatbelt? crashed yet!"" president basically thing.....America fuk think want, fact opening schools increase infection count European countries there's study actually looks infectiousness children, spell much less likely children spread disease.

I could link studies, can't arsed, might well googling benefit anyway. NL reported weekly

Still daily stats RIVM site. 55 it‚Äôs 6%. 94% Covid deaths 55 older. Take comorbidities yes, it‚Äôs highly, highly unlikely dying disease 55 healthy. Overall fatality rate 1 200. break even point 50 years old. 50 odds go down, 50 odds go up. 

But hospitalization risk high - haven‚Äôt look appears 1 50. c,one odds long term health impacts well. 

But I‚Äôm sure point - everyone go business? way, 50 crowd cash - aren‚Äôt spending, eating out, staying fit, traveling, economy fucked anyway. board meetings Chairwoman Michelle Steel regularly hammered low positivity rate push reopening. I‚Äôm sure used application early reopening. Life lot grosser like think. ever considered poo particles breathe going #2?
Shit nasty motto whatever get sick make sick (vomit) a-okay.
Mainly mantra reference eat leftovers. used first one trash conspiracy nutcases governments around world unabashedly lying people, see theyre coming Goddamn it, always thought that""evolve"" feature plague incorporated game unrealistic game play element...I guess wrong Whoa, good know. Yeah I've actually impressed mayor's aggressive stance, unfortunately can't overrule governor. Half million dead, half billion recovered  hope screw up. India seen anti vaccine propaganda far. people sections society generally think vaccines good them. screw one might far greater consequences considering challenges come lower rate education, poverty wait day call ""registered / tested cases"". states ok, many seeing percentage positive tests rising, means disease spreading faster. See source shows Incorrect positive rate? I‚Äôve coming across Q people twitter think article evidence inflating cases. don‚Äôt seem realize care result ‚Äúmistake‚Äù really earlier reopening. fucking way China‚Äôs numbers accurate point US surpass real numbers least took seriously point. Yeah

In past months there's tons studies every aspect virus. despite virus kept alive contact surfaces controlled (laboratory) settings, real life examples transmission observed. So, even though headline says study concludes spread easily, article says found children carriers virus ""major drivers transmission"". So, study (or least article says study) even look evidence whether ""can spread easily adults"", chose reach conclusions based positive swabs.

Either incredibly lazy journalism bad science. suspect former. cops absolute pieces shit? shocking! Indian, you‚Äôre. Lol Good news? fantastic news! adopt baby cobra? 

Where sign up? Sneks frens! right, medical workers required get annual flu shot far know. Every hospital different protocol.

For needing oxygen worse, dexamethazone cheap, widely available reduce mortality, I'd shocked hospital using now.

As say, going prone also proven work. Frankly, get disease go prone immediately, even hospitalization. hows thoughts prayers working Mike ? called Universal Basic Income. vulnerable pay necessities endanger others. People really need stop focusing death rates only. misleading least two important ways:

1.) know virus able kinds long-lasting damage body, even otherwise healthy people ""mild"" infections. Covid-19 binary ""survived fine dead"" type situation.

2.) substantial number patients require hospitalization virus high transmissibility, even without symptoms. threatens quickly crash healthcare systems. Clinical outcomes Covid-19, obviously many diseases accidents, heavily depend quality availability care. there's hospital capacity, death rates shoot across board. course we‚Äôre testing enough kids. really think could hold 3 year old 15 seconds recreate Egyptian mummifying procedure. 

But seriousness, fall going disaster. four kids. teach. exhausted. wish wishes changed reality. Good luck! orange baboon probably: world respects us!

Wait... go too? make N95 underwear? I‚Äôve worked pools years pool water nearly safe think. argument misting pool water onto surfaces sanitize them. CDC suggests bleach (sodium hypochlorite) concentration 500-1000ppm order disinfect/sanitize surfaces respectively. Even concentration reaction isn‚Äôt instant. take 45 seconds contact actually neutralize viruses. Even so, typical pool contain around 3ppm. remember concentration chlorine pool safe enough drink small quantities. pool full people it‚Äôs hot day don‚Äôt surprised find many public pools can‚Äôt maintain chlorine feed lucky maintain concentration 1ppm periods &lt;1. someone poops pool can‚Äôt continue swimming, raise chlorine level substantially hours entire operating day order neutralize pathogens. really going huh? learn? Well said! Humans act Justly Nature, incentivized long ignore Common Sense, Scientific Evidence, Compassion.

I would withhold Human Slaves torture Machine Citizens take Governments back Corporations. According CDC, around 30,000 people US die flu flu season; length time flu season current pandemic. coronavirus severe flu, point stands.

Mexico seen [nurses 


I mean way Mexico masterfully controlling pandemic, really can. 50% positive test rate severe cases tested. developing country 

It's can. mentioned comments, government purposefully played virus March, president continuing hold rallies encourage people hug other. Even refuses wear mask get coronavirus test despite fact he's exposed coronavirus twice. Mexico developing country also world's 15th biggest economy. mean, testing comparable rate Benin Zimbabwe. That's really bad Haha thanks laugh, totlally describes him. Mexico actually horrible it. amount testing pathetic compared Latin American countries like peru, chile, brazil fine black people wear masks. Galveston county area, complete chaos. Half people wear masks half don't. Hell even store clerks wear masks time. gf required wear mask work, one allowed without one. places enforce even practice it. Went go get beer today clerk wearing mask.  blood clotting disease. creates blood clots lungs. It''s nothing like flu wish widespread PSAs explaining public. Everyone unnecessarily worrying children widely accepted morality rate near 0 Safety Theater. Finally way explain it! I‚Äôve looking right words since March. 

Outside pro-tip: start buying clearance beach towels keep storage bin room. go outside something sit on, go back bin sealed lid toss wash! Hospitalization rates way compared first wave, though (not everywhere course eg. NYC) think rioting bad, try cancelling football America... fact anything people people died afraid actually go hospital. Who‚Äôs top thread? Please show me. high stronger drug. dealth cult known Christianity. ‚ÄúThe doctors said antibodies, greatest antibodies. look don‚Äôt find antibodies like mine‚Äù "" Macias, diabetes overweight "" 


Well, go... drove track. told roads unless necessary order lower risk car accident putting emergency services risk exposed virus First I'm yankee. Second confirmed case rising death rates not. Testing people looks worse shut nobody idea spreads, bad could be, pretty much anything. 

We know much now...outdoor transmission nearly impossible, masks good, nursing homes get hit badly, bars restaurants inside activity people close together long time worst. 

We don‚Äôt need large scale shutdowns again, know problem locations are. puts Baghdad Bob shame. officer safety issue. question far go protect without fucking rest society? long reasonable this? wipe desks every single day. Every year wind strep, flu, nasty cold. favorite classroom tool bleach spray. I‚Äôm telling you- there‚Äôs chance stop it. yeah suppose subreddits follow. Unfortunately follow lot subreddits time experiance can't help browse r/all find new content check world events since I've indoors nearly four months now, often times check r/all news full bs gets going cases like today feel depressed, bored apathetic there's nothing interesting browse reddit, goes repetative harmful cycle. TIL Dick Cheney still alive LMAO ""America's death rate better per capita European countries""

""Except density far lower""

""No... New York dense anywhere Europe.""

Right. Gotcha. wait till Florida releases numbers! It‚Äôll intense race!

Oh wait, they‚Äôre releasing shit. minimum spread brother mom, hospital explains Elon's current spouting Twitter false positives. tests, cases, welcome Disney World folks! (taps forehead) classroom‚Äôs ventilation mold situation already concern lol. understand 200,000 cases today, would mean one 1 every 20 cases globally Florida.. limit geographical spread virus staying local, also told stay local limit amount cars road order lower amount traffic accidents would obviously put emergency services risks coming contact someone might virus bright side? Hey dude noticed, gonna get exposed it. late martial law, gonna run course. Serious; 100k new cases test 80k day? Let add: world going let use bathrooms!? generous employers getting angry: quickly sacked people beginning pandemic, (surprise surprise...) complain stimulus generous people want come back work. 


The corporations bitten bullet though getting 75% employees salary paid get pandemic (that plan came weeks stimulus).

I skip details, that's mostly it...

Provinces also plans, (but all, mind you...) people business covered.


AND levels government less speak one voice (the voice science)... sounds unfamiliar? nipples must breathin' people suddenly concerned 80 year olds dying nursing homes. concern covid? never ever saw people counting deaths like covid. stuck. keep child safe take streets citizens fix failure government. phrase ""Knew"" one color one surprised! That‚Äôs interesting statement! sucks may reason - takes get people wearing masks, fine. really care motivation - long people masks outcome. mean like people marching huge protests 10‚Äôs thousands close proximity yelling shouting without masks hours end? definitely blame. Sane Politician besides progressives like Bernie, AOC, et.al. Disney World opening soon deep inside corona hot zone!

People think must absolutely safe kids Florida Disney World open! Mickey Mouse would hurt kids, nasty rumor stop us fun!

And pandemic roll gain even steam. Also president pivoted mask wearing thing little. Here‚Äôs truth: it‚Äôs harder teachers go back normal schedule. lazy choice would let everything proceed normal don‚Äôt bothered adapting curriculum, teaching styles, resources effective remote learning. World : lockdown stop spread. wear masks keep distance, ask experts.

If hinder individual spread potential, limit public life activities authorities capacity trace infections quarantine people to, good.

 

US/Brazil: Coronavirus political hoax. Lockdown hoax, let's party bitcheeeeeeees

&amp;#x200B;

World: Corona Cases drop

US/Brazil: STONKS fuck say would done 2 months? I‚Äôm saying high amount cases currently experiencing could‚Äôve avoided. 2 months restrictions could ease tiny bit. Even rat could tell that‚Äôs better going sub particular joke. Anything points disease nearly dangerous media makes immediately slammed. He‚Äôs right - it‚Äôs mental. Trump needs go US going get torn apart COVID, it‚Äôs prob already late ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è want make obvious horror movie joke right now... ""..Hopefully God‚Äôs help, I‚Äôll able survive this.‚Äù

God gave scientists people advising wear masks, socially distance go social events.

As drowing man joke fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help.  man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you.""  stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me.""  rowboat went on.  motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you.""  stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""  motorboat went on.  helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""  stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""  helicopter reluctantly flew away.  water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""  God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter, expect?"" Interestingly, actually work essential industry. needed keep working, did. 90% us could work home, sent home even state order came through. still working home. field crews still field, owe debt gratitude them.

Point being, businesses bosses handled lot compassion common sense bosses. would nice government step in, private industry pretty job places too. one make wear mask! I'll take 2nd amendment advisement. mess Texas. Abbot Rome name? Bless Trump. easily understood, severe IQ deficit US. say time go, much Cuz feels better without one... I'll pull face away sneeze, promise. Hah Highway 'rona zone, ride 'rona zone China never invade US... US citizens quite nice job killing already, Asian community pretty much left always wear masks.

I (and Asian other-half) already wear mask too, guess we'll left Australia too. Outdoor pools lakes reopening (with limited capacity) weeks Germany, AFAIK swimming-related outbreaks (yet). Honestly always thought days much natural selection humans vaccines treatments.

I stand corrected. selection genetics health political beliafs. similar speaking flat earthers. read John Bolton's book Trump often picks people 'central casting' role. runs countey like reality show. I'm guessing likes scarfs. love job, honestly. love students ton fun do. said, kids spread germs like crazy normal situation. they‚Äôre 11-14 years old mean don‚Äôt want put things mouth day long touch face! won‚Äôt even get started washing hands.. it‚Äôs going long year. mean like Sean Hannity months saying serious wear damned mask? every one reporters wears mask they're outside? Bias bias even comes left get silver n95 reach it? small town (8000 people including two smaller towns within 5 miles) acting like it‚Äôs real even though we‚Äôre averaging 6 new cases day. know people contact positive COVID 19 patients still going Walmart like it‚Äôs nothing. Walmart next county they‚Äôre seeing cases well. It‚Äôs basically clusterfuck. mandatory California, people care here. many people town refuse wear it. love job, honestly. love students ton fun do. said, kids spread germs like crazy normal situation. they‚Äôre 11-14 years old mean don‚Äôt want put things mouth day long touch face! won‚Äôt even get started washing hands.. it‚Äôs going long year. Shame enforcement mechanism collectivism instance. singular individual might compelled wear mask aversion punishment (i.e. shame), punishment arises net values individuals, en masse, comprise society. let poor bastard go already gotta feel sorry ones assholes infect, them. There‚Äôs people trying safe people bars grocery stores well. It‚Äôs fine, need kind natural selection yahoos running around flip flops dirty tanks. long bring blm signs virus stay away heard infect kinds large crowded extended gatherings. appears reason findings 2 months ago new information. That's kind thoughtful virus check date birth.

Evennn case statistically, feel obligation help society times need? duty avoid catching virus even 18 year old could pass someone older would die.

Why people selfish?  Work middle school counselor parents want us go back full school traditional start date. don‚Äôt children, still don‚Äôt feel comfortable going back fully, especially numbers even peaked! best lovely comments lazy don‚Äôt want go back work. Sad state affairs in. Exactly this. I'm 100% masks, numbers they're ridiculous. think whole world still lockdown, taking every day comes terms Covid-19.

This make sense U.K kind grasp things stands. quite close. U.S sadly suffering it, makes sense right stop travel there.

Stay safe we'll get this. rely per capital death rate make broad statement, use population density address specific point. don‚Äôt like makes argument weak. 'death rates' 'body counts' people? 

How people sick. perfectly preventable disease. Countries around planet proven so. hell even take chances? 

Just lockdown, mask wearing, contact tracing fullest extent shit would've handled. testing... Yeah, sinks require touch handle turn off‚Äîthe handle people touched germ-ridden hands turn on. Also, many American beaches soap paper towels. Cool give fuck people dying, losing limbs, needing double lung transplants... agree much anything topic Since rally, eight rump staff slaves tested positive virus many directed self-quarantine Friday night, according ABC News. Alabama confirmed happened college students I'm fb twitter work mate found one admin people bit hardcore racist due fb posts. work they're one friendlist outgoing people know, IRL. need ""expert"" warn this, there's something seriously wrong picture... remember seeing post small pox quarantine Simpson County 1898 seriously intense isolating county laws place encouraging others contact law enforcement others justice. 'clean' Simpson County would force surrounding counties infected counties stay away enter Simpson County. mail carrier systems stopped, practicing physicians allowed travel borders. Ferrymen rivers subject quarantine laws. 

Every citizen county requested guard report sheriff infractions law. violation quarantine laws 30-day imprisonment fine 50 dollars. ~ 1550 modern dollar value.

I've going tad far sometimes this. get live AZ. Churches never made close (some close, definitely all). stay home order, many things classed ""essential"" been. Hair nail salons, example. took weeks closed. Aside that, Governor Ducey actually mostly okay, Trump came visit everything started opening early. space 8 days salons, dine-in restaurants, bars, gyms, pools, casinos malls allowed open. distancing guidelines places supposed follow, many not.

A lot people seem care pandemic all, went right back normal behavior stay home order ended middle May. Mayors cities wanted mandate masks, blocked Ducey's order. finally allowed mandate masks couple weeks ago. that, mask usage seem widespread. Oh Trump held rally type thing church: around 3000 people, barely anyone wearing masks, course distancing. rally held masks mandated city county, masks enforced rally. 

On Monday week, Ducey ordered gyms, bars, water parks movie theaters close least 30 days. However, many gyms defied order continue open. trying sue Ducey/the state. 

As someone taken pandemic seriously start, depressing see what's happening here. hospital situation getting scary. I'm sure people congregate like crazy weekend July 4th numbers continue spiral control. test positivity rate around 25% awful. lot people struggling get tested, too, definitely need testing. contact tracing woefully inadequate, too. Scientists also know humans causing global warming kill many millions next 100 years. 

Covid really bad, anti-intellectualism actually worst disease spreading around globe. even find masks start assholes buying resell. Add cdc essentially lying effectiveness wearing one nationwide shortages barely enough health care workers top surprising failed go control earlier. lure in. T√§nk fritt ist√§llet! Florida need wiping tbf. Walking vectors. Glad nothing kids. police exercise brutality anybody wearing masks. sounds like better solution killing black l people. go bars pandemic first place. 

Obviously assholes ones ""started it,"" fuck's sake, really need server local sports bar crack open beer? beer home 100% charge health. also think it‚Äôs physicians familiar finding better ways treat I‚Äôm moving, anything? Lol 38% yanks obese, 80% overweight above. They‚Äôre making fun brainlets. What‚Äôs penalty break it?  Unless know priori infected (which don't, every test assumed symptomatic and/or exposed), OK treat infections random. Students, especially, going look random. defunding police. Everyone hates police, negative PR public feed of. Good job America People wearing masks hunted sport. Tired sooo much winning Tennis fine. 100 percent lied to. Savannah shit show. Cases spiking, many mouth breathers around act like never virus begin with. Walking around downtown, hard-pressed know pandemic.

That is, restaurants businesses shutting daily due Covid cases.

One restaurant closed due Covid, reopened 24 hours later.

24. HOURS.

Just... Stay far away can. fucking up.

(Though mayor made masks mandatory! Though Karen's already found way around it). good, it. Cuz know that! A-hah-hah-ah-ah-ah. allow people without masks hunted impunity. sounds like Texan kind solution. Accountability something used keep small people line checked. Elites different rules, understand carrots even bigger carrots.  called framing.

""framing today, framing tomorrow, framing forever"" hateful ring demon code prevents declining rock challenge. That's good measurement. state currently flat-lined hospitalizations. Given opened Texas Florida, essentially back regular lives, assume like Texas 2 weeks? Exactly! I'm thankful. I'm sad, quit job I've twenty years sucked. I'm honestly worried guys. guy vegetable. cruelly keep people alive religious zealots. left die long ago. Wearing seatbelt personal choice? 

Wow, tell police give ticket wearing seatbelt. I'm sure able explain views body choice.

It's sad story. real example rights end impacts someone else's life in, could kill them.

You wear seatbelt safety passengers car others road.

1% people tested ones getting fucked.

If whole nation tested thats gonna like way less 1%  way bragged it. didn‚Äôt want people riot. can‚Äôt take every Vice away once. Ban Florida strongest immunologically show Europe like disease infested conquistador showing newly discovered America. done. can't see way recover this. Whoever president is, change outcome. way force military intervention weld people shut home/shelter across US 2 months. never happen, matter party government. vaccines come give great results made available cheaply everyone US, legal, undocumented, poor, rich, young, old. also never happen.

We done. America fallen. public health first, economy soon follow. Next, world's economy. Bars gyms fo countries pull New Zealand. can't crush virus get drink socially workout gym. 96%? That's shitty Go pharmacy. going pot shop really. can't speak economists everywhere, country absolutely economists (at least 2-3, small country) cost-benefit analysis show 'saving' lives tank economy thus arguing lockdown similar measures etc. Yeah agree, there‚Äôs definitely doomsday circlejerk ""war crime"" something wasnt deemed war crime call out. fair. Same. makes perfect sense. people getting tested people talking happened, week I've seen horror movie before, black characters always first die.

I think possible trump's black support may dropped zero. today, pooled tests received authorization FDA although agency encouraging submissions. significant concern decreased sensitivity test. Smaller pools better ensure fewer false negatives. It‚Äôs challenging ask. hold slightest scrutiny roundly criticized. People getting sick dying good economy? would thought..... ICUs never maximum capacity. issue fire free order anybody wearing masks. God I‚Äôm glad! Glad isn‚Äôt Americans batshit crazy Given samples good test many months, I'll call bullshit one. think 2k deaths day baked cake atleast week two next 2 months. 

When locked March virus limited couple cities, virus spread everywhere. Exponential growth 10 pots, different exponential growth 1000 pots.  Actually data support claim. lot outbreaks see tracked back Memorial Weekend reopenings reckless decisions lift quarantines peaks. protests major contributor. speculate downplay want‚Äîthe data bear out. discussion COVID-19 effects has. specific individual outcomes. hope get emotional sympathetic thousands unfortunate deaths occur every day (hunger/ disease etc). 

Unfortunately doubt I‚Äôll see fighting social media isn‚Äôt fashionable right now. discussion COVID-19 specifically risk children outline slim none. Don‚Äôt get emotional. Amputate infection!

maybe old people, men cook, live SRO Maybe I'm incredibly unlucky person, roll dice odds. 0.5% like going hockey game full arena, one every 200 people go home...I know people think that, buying tickets knew hand.  
  
And guy's even 0.5%, he's still alive. still says 1 5 people test positive need hospitalized, information places [like show studies report significant percentage people hospitalized effects still present long-term.  
  also reported increase inflammation damage heart muscle Covid-19 patients. One study published March found 416 hospitalized Covid-19 patients, 19% showed signs heart damage.  
  also found evidence scarring Covid-19 patients' lungs. According Parshley, CT scans show Covid-19 patients light gray patches lungs called ""ground-glass opacities,"" always heal. One Chinese study found patches 77% patients, Parshley reports.  
  soon tell whether lung damage Covid-19 patients permanent, research shows one third survivors similar coronaviruses SARS MERS long-term lung damage.  
  
People focus way much death rate, serious long-term health implications whole thing driving public response, seem rarely talked about. Lewis county. Sheriff total trumpster.

How's working far? Joe Rogan sure, never stops talking it.  King County 251 cases today literally highest case day ever. Obviously due increased testing, percent positive increased significantly well. We're still OK we're hardly crushing right now. Yay, Florida wins! I‚Äôm NC well. seems like one gives rats ass around here. bars open don‚Äôt require masks social distancing! ticket crime. ticket summons. never know specific case. However, controllable factors suspect right give edge:

* Vaccination history. reason, people received flu vaccines seem fare better.

* Previous coronavirus infections. different coronavirus before, appears help.

* Vitamin deficiency. Study study showing worse outcomes tend Vitamin deficient. Warning though, megadosing also appears hurt.

* Sleep. Like respiratory viral illnesses, adequate sleep early stages reduce severity later.

to get precise, know 1024 2.4% greater 1000. 1.024 \* 3 1.072, since true calculation 1.024 \^ 3, add little bit, call 7.3% greater 10 million. that's 10.73 million. how'd do?

Florida's numbers point way worse New York's stage, they're locking down.

You hide test results test, can't hide bodies. like playing Plague, Inc. Thank you, makes lot sense! Lots ethnicities live hood socialize together others ostracized faith. lived biggest city experienced myself. Diverse ass. Texans want things watered suit Texans, call diverse. would awesome, high school isn‚Äôt even requiring masks distancing. state also top four states positive cases skyrocketing. care teachers staff. hope survive unavoidable school closures again. Remember ready open Easter? Testing increased lot well. positive rate risen little, even though still pretty low 5%. started seeing lot Seattle. *Right.* Wait till roll College Gameday: Rona edition know that‚Äôs insanely dangerous part kind happy people exist weird way they‚Äôre hilarious (with one notable exception)

Ah yes, Elon Musk Batman Yup! Chris Kattan, Jon Stewart, Janine Garofalo, Dennis Leary. Blast past right there! I‚Äôm sorry worry parents. central Texas, in-laws acting way. 80‚Äôs, one horse heart valve, diabetes high blood pressure still think it‚Äôs okay go stores use available delivery services. Hell even use stuff delivered house one delivers area yet. They‚Äôre ‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs go library, yep Home Depot open let‚Äôs go today!‚Äù Oh need milk bread I‚Äôll go store since don‚Äôt need $35 worth stuff spend $100. It‚Äôs frustrating. say wear masks none us seen on. hang rear view mirror never sanitized them. told can‚Äôt see great grand kids live around corner careless, bad guys. It‚Äôs frustrating. board since beginning this. lived us lot control. home come go please :( going see fallout makes 2008 look like 2007. lack leadership. one recovering next decade Oh know. It‚Äôs insane number. Hard wrap head around IMO. protesters essentially wore masks, due density inability socially distance, recommended public health authorities.

I see point? protesters gathered responsibly, means okay people gather irresponsibly? late conspiracy theorists. get side make sense, redefine communally agreed upon professionally agreed upon terms. 

When breach concept word means, lost argument argument is, definition (ironic), new topic.  change name Greg Stupid.  NFL? Maybe.  going interesting see statistical post-mortum. Right numbers political it‚Äôs hard know what‚Äôs what‚Äôs down. we‚Äôd sacrificing many few. (I think)   seeing happening. Biggest issue people claim medical condition prevents using face cover. boyfriends elderly parents way there....‚Äùbut driving, flying‚Äù Oh, okay takes risks away.  introvert... love it. please 2 zoom video calls day, camera ""breaks"".


I also never need fake excuse wanting shake someones hand ever again!!! Usually claim ""i coming with/getting cold"". scoff say ""RONA"". Good job America üëè  I've comparing 'pillow talk' Mata Hari even though C.O. buddies warned her. came across [this looking Italy, kind confirms saying - looks like less deaths average early year, drastic rise. 

 

However, even case (that number deaths similar across years), think important attribute possibility COVID-19 may deadly. Instead, seems like late 2019/early 2020 abnormalities COVID severe making differences. Strictly enforced fines. thing make stupid comply. never said that, did. I'm saying woukdve honest different response wouldve happened. Last thing saw said underreporting 28 times number actually was. wouldve reporting upwards 10k+ cases day. wouldve changed everything. cant see might blind cost faking medical exemption one tooth. Lame p---- told reject evidence eyes ears. final, essential command. Even worse put people wearing them!  death rate WAY since mid-April across age groups according CDC Vanilla Ice Loch Ness Monster whole time!  Much better place exactly?? Zero accountability, zero hope anything else resolving short literal miracle burning asap (not happening) need install Air Force One hyper clean it.. ira, ironizing air? Kills 99% COVID almost immediately

So even COVID plane, rest assured it‚Äôll gone enter üòÉ 5% people get die + tens thousands dying hospitals fucked trying deal cases Thanks that. fucked Mayor Amity Jaws actually seems like less caricature short-sighted shithead politician someone irl think amount service economy jobs specialization labor tasks robotic get without intermittent camps broken discarded human souls. father, got covid LTC worked in, also otherwise healthy young (57). hospital two months trying stay updated reading everything doctors hospital. doubted doctors informed form comfort me. case similar Cordero's ways also following Cordero. dad suffered lot passed away last Wednesday there's sort small relief escaped difficult life would path recovery. miss dearly knowing pain would go survived equally tragic. winning critically ill sucks reality get there.

If healthcare worker, respects give you. Thank time. Last week multiple homes block surrounding blocks parties. pretty sure weekend well obvious everyone cotton fibers filter virus 130x smaller width fibers?

It's not, experts say. argument strawman. experts say little protect wearer (although some), *help* filter exhale lessen trajectory, *help* protect around turns public wearing cotton masks increases rate transmission (due extra moisture, extra face touching, etc.)?

And wearing masks makes easier aliens kill us? questions disingenuous. üòé Alexa, please play Little Late Jojo. WE'RE #1 USA USA USA

Cancel fking olympics, dont care! never tire WINNING!!!

/s FUCK YEAH! NEW GLOBAL RECORD!

USA! USA! USA! IT! long take get results back pool test? long take get results back regular test? long wait time get tests FL? Sounds like lot time fuckin wasted. fucking cares legal definition spousal abuse. point cops high degree leeway use lethal force long feel felt ""threatened"". worrying 40% cops, basically get away murder said made nervous, statistically deviant rate *shoving, pushing, shouting, losing temper* partners? treat partners, extremely disconcerting people might treat strangers trained view threats, especially given large amount legal protection officers get friendly police unions overall positive public perception.

*Edit:* *should* 0% abuse rate cops. actually matter cops compare general population, number zero. Everyone fired. ""defunded police"" firing every police officer abusive record reached 0%, already agreed would good thing. Don‚Äôt know seen site gives graph shows tests performed rate positive tests. think telling chart determine fast it‚Äôs spreading. Looks like rise since beginning June would seem coincide lot states opening back up. 

But question getting tested? don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs entirely accurate unless test population random. US number one everything?


Let go like Elsa Couldn‚Äôt ignore data longer restaurant workers go strike covid guidelines followed? industry associations still ""Phrasing!""? weighed benefit

Americans demonstrated repeatedly suck risk assessment. They've weighed anything.  /s guy works hospital actually tested contact someone also tested positive. knew risk infecting people gym knew seriousness actually works hospital. care. sane governor given away local radio station? Like gag thing? get virus. rarely get really ill it. Even less young adults. Still children infect others might get seriously ill even die.  Nope, clear upward trend hospitalizations get worse Kill poor. 

Godless republicunts. God sees agenda. 

Burn. Anyone know % hospitalized? people wake up? Stay home wear mask public. Pretty simple.  isn‚Äôt really people it? mean deaths weeks? numbers could looking at? Hopefully US HHS CDC nail Operation Warp Speed plan, producing vaccine, creating injection doses, distribution plan network. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will work? idea. glad hear working almost two months now.  majority studies showing actively harmful? those? wish people Hell Bent Leather instead. Trump said would disappear April. Dumb cunt True, personally I'm way worried people inside can't avoid easily, way better nothing. saying true, also clearly trying say humorous, ""clever"" way poor taste Stop. Quarantine distance. No, understand: bigger state map, higher population is. Alaska America's populated state.  Stats lie. America deserves shit gets. One worst countries earth filled worst people earth. governor vetoed funding online education. place winning.

 bother. like ""off rails"" guy antics. could mute. better yet reply. I'm shocked disturbed - **Vanilla Ice still concerts**? mean, sure COVID stuff bad, but...Vanilla Ice? fuck let happen? good finally. Texas infections getting hand. look happend stage screen actor Nick Corduro, man's career even lockdown first place üòÇ What‚Äôs going developing new drugs treat virus? haven‚Äôt hearing news companies creating drugs treat trials right anything like that. know Remdesivir one used late trials soon approved? know many developed late trials anything like that? That's economy works, though. US economy dependent upon *growth*. people die, quite literally exact opposite growth. Maybe meant 15 million Haha typed long reply completely misinterpreting post. funny, appreciate advice thanks letting know going on. Well, instructor called rogue wave, I've going that, plus I'm bit drama queen comes almost drowning üôÇ CDC recommend 5 gallon mask 10 gallon?  FYI masks avoid spreading germs, help getting people, common misconception. stop getting wash hands often, never touch face. understand science process, edict written stone tablets? part endless cycle fairness college admissions.

First, admissions boards look students, grades, history, make decisions based think best.

Then, everyone complains unfair results arbitrary decisions, need standardized system allow everyone even chance, group people board get use personal preferences prejudices decide people's fates.

So standardized testing put place, everyone cheers things fair.

Until place while, complaints start mount testing unfair, many students good taking tests deserve chance get in, better student's entire life could taken consideration test score?

And cycle begins again. Another USA world record One thing I've got hand NYC they've really made good progress. One protester leaders went home, found roommates contracted Covid-19, went back protesting, kept got symptoms.

People beyond stupid. forced wear masks. forget freedom comes responsibility. Likely enough testing done early data NY/NYC swamps everything else early on. look places testing large numbers deaths deaths usually lag 2-4 weeks. forget spun it. Oh, said media stopped covering little bit. Man hope not. think true heroes deserve well beyond get right compensation 2 3 weeks like 100k death day  Maybe 2 weeks? Hope not. Generalize much? us actually much Left leaning thought elected officials done absolute shit job handling situation. Granted large amount morons please don‚Äôt lump responsible Texans rest. F@ck!ng Florida! again!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Uh wouldn‚Äôt legal. likely hospitals run money close. That‚Äôs exactly right. People always America America. don‚Äôt travel outside country, don‚Äôt see rest world is. part, hate pick south. know it‚Äôs everyone everywhere general. Uneducated, poor, barely making week time week. shown news tells great America everyone else awful democracy hating libruls trying take away their...what ever don‚Äôt anything left give ive got friends scoff green new deal, Fox News talking points AOC crazy coming get back behind bar. try explain would creAte trillions revenue, literally millions jobs, huge investment country. Nope that‚Äôs crazy who‚Äôs gonna pay it? trillions away support got $1200. take that. Nope (more Fox News talking points)

I try explain US around 300 years. Rome ruled millennia crashes. really bad cross roads, literally everything stake. I‚Äôm praying youngest generation see what‚Äôs going despite efforts hide it. could moving towards next phase humanity species, cower hundreds thousands Americans money, food, bankrupt, dying stuffed hospital beds able afford care live it, hurricanes slam already vacant shores harder stronger thanks climate change fail acknowledge.

I mean. sounds crazy say loud. Remember arms kids cages (still that). dunno best dates know escaped attention Fauci first made comment June 23rd.

Canceling coronavirus research middle pandemic OK. Daycares safer schools - I‚Äôve seen 9 kids pod, would impossible school. totally get decision. don‚Äôt think could send kid daycare either time. recognize India literally 1 billion people US, right? China 1 billion too. US shouldn‚Äôt ever 50% Covid cases, based population.... We‚Äôre fucked. time ironic Independence ever Teachers, janitors, maintenance people, bus drivers, food service, what's plan keep people safe school starts fall?

Let guess, crickets fabulous leaders federally. sure earning fat salaries lifetime free healthcare huh? every state, city town flailing around like usual. Gawd bless 'Murca! agree people ignore street oh China using fuck asian countries may wish check pun.  
Sorry act goofy.   science you: They're gonna go havasu, spread/ get virus, come back spread virus. Even Ventura county cases LA started rising blamed this? Yes 601 deaths.

Awhile back ""experts"" saying we'd 25k new cases 3k deaths day June 1st. happen. We're seeing exponential death rates.

Yes things bad I'm trying look #s RECORD CASES EVERY DAY DOOM DOOM DOOM

Imagine fucktard states done mandatory masks 2 months ago instead of...today.

And bars cruiseships young douchebags. Cluster events. Skip bar like diabetic retiree carnival cruise...  read article day expect baby slump finances, birth control requests went 50% online retailers. really made think life.  old truck garage needs get back road. Time getting away me. I've traded another truck bunch parts get engine work done. I'm going put couple guys work garage couple days get money pockets. think lung damage caused ARDS/pneumonia aspect covid. Cytokine storm usually attacks organs simultaneously. also clotting version covid, lost leg. still morons. Judges give qualified immunity legal accountability, human (as now) give COVID-19 immunity.  nope everyone pile, let god sort Impossible. tons testing sites within 100 miles me. full shit. Go get tested stop complaining lack tests. That's majority case's NYC. started decreasing rest country exponential growth stage things. 

So looked like things getting better, quietly getting worse rest states... I'm programmer formal education. started shit job web dev highschool gave bunch experience. also published bunch open source work. enough get much better job.

Experience open source work worth much certificates. fucker may lead world war, almost guarantee we‚Äôll see sort large scale conflict traced back economic hit world takes US‚Äôs response pandemic. 

When people start worry stability, worse people tend rise power. 

It‚Äôs got Hitler, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, various warlords Africa, Mexico, South America. Fucking economy quickly leads rises powers dictators.

It‚Äôs going wild ride next 10 years. Protesting haircuts protesting police violence society equivalent, BLM protesters largely wear masks.

Trump politicized mask wearing, one else. Sorry Commander Dipshit abhorrent failure. Thank god drug companies greedy cheap. lol made account 2 days ago shit America south talk great Canada is? bro. live Rochester people stopped wearing masks stores weeks ago u blame media? Exaggeration? They. Dont. Stop. Counting. In. May. Guidelines actual rules. Boo. ADA still require allowing inside unmasked (a reasonable accommodation include risking employees/other customers) long store pickup option someone shop them. still fine assholes keep barging stores. winning cases every day! I'm sorry. hope CPTSD. think would listened him. think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs clear would listened him. already chosen livelihoods, health, families. Eh. Lockdown January would saved lives. way could mobilized enough people get concoction enough time. Trump still messed big. Regardless political viewpoints. **M**anufacturing **A**merican **G**raves **A**gain. Better cut shit out. know way bring numbers stop texting. /s Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck  call guy living big house painted white. Plus guy Florida felt need close beaches. I'm worried there's vaccine, what's going happen countries like Thailand world re-opens? countries already experienced worst Covid likely fare better herd immunity, countries shielded Covid either remain shut, risk bad wave Covid Oh seen news today military admitting soldiers issued bayonets deal DC protests? Pa spikes Senate may let dangle stick actual core philosophy say ""Your own. government support you,"" thought 30,000 lot cases. Breaking: Mexico agreed pay wall! Who? (No, World Health Organization) still coworker thinks virus ""made-up"" rational?? Nobody wife knows died, therefore dosen't exist. U.S. dealing worst ""first wave"" hotspots shifted ended. guy bar used bottle weapon. could felony. Probably best masked couple police start looking charges, despite aggressive mouth breathers without masks behaivor. magically disappeared 

Amazing Well, said violent crime initial post, that's ok. Rural areas meth crime really proves little happens assure meth shortage city. fact, Saint Floyd died tweaking meth! Hell, could even say urban areas cesspool meth opioid induced bat-shittery easily rural areas! could say ""Rural areas problem meth crime and..."" Oh yeah, nothing else! Wait, Florida lockdown? numbers? 
As European (where got control) US baffling me. links image dead unfortunately, go. also resources posted people thread. America science denying federation. Mostly Quebec lesser degree Ontario. Something like 60-70 percent cases Canada Quebec. 

Rest country much better. Nanuvut still place world without single case. Could be. virus wants host stay alive, otherwise die to. Abbott saying f fauci last months

You're thinking Lt. Governor, think, went record saying going listening anything Fauci say. Illinois continues lead way virus response. removed dereliction duty. defund enforce laws. Oh agree, going unknown territory plus exceptionalism Americans practice rules don‚Äôt apply concerning Pretty casual considering lost parents leading cases per day per capita also though it‚Äôs artifact testing though aren‚Äôt nearly enough testing either. 50 percent us well aware danger. However one political party named hell bent sabotaging everything power. May report published Well Trust, researchers project deaths despair could reach anywhere 27,644 **154,037** isn‚Äôt done address mental health problems perilous COVID-19 pandemic. 

Based official covid death count + projected undercounts, we're already past high end projection. What's disability rate? much cost average? OC: ""oh, uh, I'm sorry... I... know that.""

Except, Virginia too, awhile ago. Big story sheriff Thurston county publicly said wouldn‚Äôt enforce mask wearing soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Close enough live Tallahassee, masks mandated, half population wearing them. bar liquor license suspended people clubbing videos Facebook Now, one days cases know 5.2% die. That's 520 one day's cohort. 5.2% death rate CDC. Wow! shit barely graduated. Wah wah wee wah! sure wishing point much wondering long till happens get them. look Massachusetts see work since state mandated two months even though state opening back still seeing significant drop cases anywhere country. I'm sure find articles link reopening restaurants surge too.

How use common sense?

This epidemic. dumb shit. Wear mask. patient. Rogan won‚Äôt get it. believes vitamin I'm working making living staying home. still leaves like 6 kids tho. Fucker hates pulling out. Virus, virus, baby... Happy cows come California.  wow USA truly fucked Facebook Devil, nothing ever good Good know mask usage areas. still find 5% mask usage area though. remember walking back car looking around ~10 people walking around outside realized mask wearer... both, would one million percent agree sentiment. 

Norovirus hellish lasts day two, week shaky over.

Four+ months covid I'm still getting ass kicked could permanent lung damage. Yay. know governor getting hot water week he's pulling back reopening since became clear people going run spread disease much possible, right? celebrate wish death illness thing science need let data accrue asserting hypothesis ""fact."" literally scientific method.

This pandemic unprecedented. understand erring side caution, let actual scientific procedures fall wayside. team Henry Ford Health System Southeast Michigan said Thursday study 2,541 hospitalized patients found given hydroxychloroquine much less likely die.

This flies face studies said. wonder controlled variables properly, something like that. Hell yes winning here! store work many failing wear mask properly. example difference Texas south: Texas crazy, south stupid. stubbornly ignore reason, plain it.
Also makes think Winston Churchill quote, ""You always count Americans right thing, tried everything else."" still say focussing elderly part problem here. Younger people think essentially immune. important remember elderly infirm susceptible extreme responses, healthy people thirties end sick weeks ICU this. pretty much vaccine proposal here? Give power every individual wear mask, shelter-in-place keep safe? seeing well works right mandates. Hey, would love give government less power people naturally care one another enough fucking put mask on, won't. fucking old parents pre-existing conditions die go buy milk eggs. Asymptomatic transmission defining characteristic disease. Unless you‚Äôre confirmed recovered coming two week quarantine, need wear mask. news, numbers lie... Kpop fans brutal hell even George Kellyann Conway's daughter trolling shit him. bet family dinners lit house. we're really lucky...maybe hurricane. Governer think Missouri held Facebook live prayer session vowing lockdown etc.. Eventually forced something.  that, might actually start taking seriously... Nevermind couldn‚Äôt even finish sentence realizing I‚Äôm talking about. would somehow blame black ppl giving him. another random person doctor/nurse friends trust me: anecdotal evidence good anyone elses. I've seen I've heard really step half average. even karens usually skills back attitude aren‚Äôt pure heart. Jesus protect true believers. 

It‚Äôs like snake handling, except microorganisms!  elicit strong reaction Desantis I'm talking, closing whole bloody state down. ain't gonna happen though, Desantis gonna ride pandemic wave till November. also, cases people hormone imbalances (thyroid diseases, also likely kinds diseases, even depression leads weight gain, even medicines cause it, isn‚Äôt easy working more) cause weight gain, often undiagnosed misdiagnosed

edit: real choice fool goes pandemic right, worded wrong shouldve used particles. However, said virus doesnt single travel own. Making sound like mode transmission droplets, referring said ""... close, breath virus"" Obviously cant inhale droplets. Short range aerosol transmission definitely big thing. yes, sense virus travel diffusing air relying droplets (the droplets wouldve evaporated sometime). know read responding based wrote lmao. like USA, India also breaking record new cases everyday. Although attributed continuously rising testing across country, people still acting rashly - neither wearing masses following social distancing (both hard instill among people).

To whoever reading this, please wear mask whenever go out. Stay safe. Jesus. Ok Trump 
/s might want look record. Abbott pulling back reopening since first sign trouble. He's quite respectful scientific realities, shy pissing people save lives. Money, money, fo honey, banana anna fo da money...money.    
(Or appease godfather) - PCR antibody. PCR detects current infection. Antibody detects past infection.

PCR testing capacity everyone interested in. runs genetic test identify infection someone needs care yet symptomatic.

Antibody tests run completely useless statistic. test diagnose disease assist contact tracing. prevalence United States low vast majority antibody tests negative wastes time, even people self-selecting them.

These combined. Careful, absolutely get called patsy, even you‚Äôve never hated anyone trump. Trust inbox.... Healthy young individuals immune virus, healthy mean 3 weeks. Everyone wear mask correctly considerate smart thing do. Ask company work home. not, take long vacation vacation days. don‚Äôt any, would suggest quit get unemployment. say functional one.  CA colleges online Fall. one kind conspiracy type person. type talking still hiding bunkers 300 pounds rice beans. support vote elections precisely I‚Äôm pleased handled COVID-19. country testing suspected people go hospital worried 3-5% positivity rate.

Your government(s) is(are) nuts. üá∫üá∏ It‚Äôs absolutely absurd. ‚ÄúWe encourage people wear masks public feel it‚Äôs necessary, though required. ‚Äú copy pasted since unknown, unreasonable point distinct possibility? fear mongering? hear but... tentative no? I‚Äôll least ask decide. Unfortunately Sars 8000 total cases it‚Äôs sacrifice we‚Äôre willing make. mean honestly surprised? south hasn‚Äôt liked science long time still medical setting tested. feel test everyone hospital covid get positive cases random like Walmart. isn‚Äôt National Guard deployed states prevent people dumb states enter smart states? fuckin troll....it‚Äôs allowed perpetuate him, well several others administration works in/for said masks ineffective. openly admitted lying Americans didn‚Äôt buy prevent getting doctors. don‚Äôt believe damn thing says anymore. We‚Äôre seeing outbreaks everywhere country, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs issue all. problem graphite reaction known scientists, technicians properly informed trained this. Apparently report exact scenario could happen, government either ignored even worse, actually hid make reactors seem safer.

Then entire string human failure surrounding testing done day. Again, crew properly trained ones done test first place, directors insisted test done. turn tables cities tried governor said impose fines punishments.  made story vehicle tow. someone works/lives major vacation ground: LOL Hopefully let ‚Äúcute little bastard‚Äù go free. Poor journalism there, England, UK Great Britain? manage put 3 one article. taking pretty seriously. go shop might come across one person wearing mask. Temperature checks every store. hands get sanitized probably 6 times visit mall, groceries. one tell Covid parties. would smash tho want minor superpowers new vaccine.

How arms stretch enough get one itchy spot middle back? gills. Gills would fun could make fortune underwater welding much lower death risk current poor dudes career. Meaning Florida sink ocean! Lonely little island green map. Feels good Masshole, once. Well, scared US now. Viruses typically mutate ways benefit themselves. longer host lives, infect. Yeah mean really figured going 2020 year college football. wasn‚Äôt anticipating games really smart ass. 1992 National Championship game VHS. dad recorded could watch together since fell asleep game. died month game. last game watched him. It‚Äôs something really special I‚Äôve held onto almost 30 years. car 3 others buckle up, accident, bodies become projectiles chances survival dropped drastically. 

Do also support right someone yell ""fire"" crowded theater, watch people get trampled? yet another example one's individual rights end. get harm others ""rights"". harm anyone else, problem people exercising rights idiots. Went point pleasant last week almost one mask, visibly saw atleast 100 people car boardwalk 3 guys mask probably came boardwalk store, crazy leave remember time china random day 15,000 cases everyone stunned. drop bucket compared lots lots complications arise flu strains 

Trump. That's all. 

Long story short, Trump job lower US power Poutine struggle rise Russian power US level. That's obvious leveling strategie, admit Trump amazingly good that, probably exceeded Russian expectations.  we're going per capita south carolina, Tennessee, Alabama make run I'm London I've heard nothing back saying.

Could let us know getting idea from? Humans hardwired terrible things hate socialization involved. species would died long time ago change diapers unable stay cohesive tribe people like.

Social media tuned trigger dopamine conditioning gets people continue caring horrible children - compulsion continue engage even expense mental health. depends many people ACTUALLY produce antibodies whether people cells resist virus without antibodies (the Swedish small scale research found every 1 person antibodies 2 cells would cause immunity)

We really clue. many ways twisting data though make COVID deadly flu watching documentary Christian community Mennonites South America ([The Mennonites ‚Äì trip back time | DW wonder general Amish Mennonites USA / Canada regard Corona. illusion. Hey build damn wall... still relevant multiple vaccines would better fast immunization everyone. doubts safety efficacy, hope works well ""For love money"" God works mysterious ways People generally die day get sick That‚Äôs point. Stay fuck away!!! know color people turn suffocating? Exactly, turn blue. Fuck them, they‚Äôre ones irresponsible pandemic. much empathy huge portion America doesn‚Äôt even believe virus &amp; actively makes situation worse. map J.F.C. additional potential clusters 4th July might add that. Big badda boom Uhm, teling people actually smart move, want plebs fucking panic ? really gotta get r/Masks4All nationwide. That's objective USA. way. many countries handled mandated masks \*the entire country\* selected parts them. single day one state override pandemic's worth stats damn well know it. Stop obtuse. Hey I'm pure indian, surprised government propaganda. However, sincerely pray work asap, although first one taking it, wait atleast 3 months (as colleges anyway shut till December) goal social distancing measures place make sure many people possible don‚Äôt get infected comes out. number deaths would occur virus didn‚Äôt make vaccine unacceptably high. Vaccines created order prevent killing people, particularly immunocompromised elderly individuals.  Wow, you‚Äôre real big brainer.

Did feel smug writing this, honest question?

It‚Äôs like saying Italy Spain high death rates. shit, hit first. 

Such stupid fucking argument ashamed typing something like out.

Greetings country population 82 million less 1k cases daily. changed password couple yrs u changed phone laptop 4 yrs ago. could reset facebook password old phone number email provider changed. 
Best thing ever happened. *What‚Äôs more, scientists today better sense measure COVID-19's lethality, numbers alarming. Using sophisticated calculation called infection-fatality rate, paired past months‚Äô worth data, latest best estimates show COVID-19 around 50 100 times lethal seasonal flu, average.*

We're playing fire. Certain groups people *still* downplaying virus *still* fighting mask mandates popping up. careening toward unmitigated, undeniable national disaster epic proportions. I‚Äôm doctor geriatrics. I‚Äôve told I‚Äôm paranoid. I‚Äôve seen coffins. FML. Probably less hundred 21 years old think point. believe Phase trials safety measures, done. think normal side effects, like sore arms, something like that. side effects still studied Phase II/III done moment. evolution something happens living things adapting world around I'm tell wife sit out. zero confidence schools take care her. barely provide resources needs. keep safe? worth 40k brings home. got one thanks. one hobbies ways relax watch college football. 

Sounds like someone problem anyone voicing opinion doesn‚Äôt mirror theirs. Maybe need get life take look mirror find hurt bad ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases nothing surface definitely culprit. worth keeping mind surface lead transmittion really hard track, quite likely under-reported, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. defense need ton due nation selfish imbeciles. Guess one many years ago given early pregnancy, babies would develope arms legs. misleading map! want wear mask tho. China 80k infected builded crazy hospitals 10 days. Every day find harder believe CHina 80k infected.

And everyday find Chinese numbers *realist*. absolutely fuck around took extremely drastic measures. understood war state virus, acted accordingly. Unlike EU locations even worth mentioning point.

See [video produced Japanese Nanjing, 3 months ago. one Netherlands European countries bought already right? No, I'm afraid ""figuring things own,"" I'm afraid finding number ways maim kill herself. 4 young left unsupervised. mean, still keep knobs stove tried ""figure out"" gas works. America control pandemic? Interesting think day dead sub cuz virus gone. it? Patrick doesn‚Äôt care anyone. stupid comments older generations sacrificing restart economy shot credibility ever had. dude get Presidential Medal Freedom, racist blowhards like Limbaugh. studies estimate 40% 70% cases transmitted pre-symptomatically.

Asymptomatic spread really hard study. probably rarer, impossible. Wuhan's mass testing found 300 asymptomatic carriers. Since Wuhan extremely comprehensive screening tracing program, would presume least got infected asymptomatic people, seen hard data one way another.

There way tell difference pre-symptomatic person asymptotic person late. fuck you. ....wtf think $$$ medical insurance for. sound like you‚Äôd get along! read children‚Äôs encyclopedia time.

At first bit worried he‚Äôd become sociopath seemed nonchalant rules, he‚Äôs naturally shy, loves explosives. Showed Mythbusters Jr it‚Äôs basically dreams come true‚Äîmath! Machines! Explosions! lol. apparently that‚Äôs wants do. electrician. He‚Äôs bad outlet (I always keep STEM stuff hand him) left devices...sheesh. Yea, site even says protects people, really wearer. says ""help"" wearer, course much all. 

It really helps people sick prevent giving people easily, especially since get droplets eyes, protecting (which mention). Mexico pays wall. ^maga  understand FDA would say they'll approve one better 50% results... ??? Bush murdered 1+ million people.

Fuck fucking monster. We, however little sparks. thankfully initial phases now, whole propaganda anti-modern medicine anti vaccine. recent coronil controversy made clear. United States show trend daily new cases increasing (since June 14), daily new deaths decreasing (from peak around April 21)? Seems counter-intuitive. Blisters. hate blisters. job well I'm unemployed! Must great side blue wall. Assam detention centres house 2000 prisoners, CCP concentration camps contain millions, according CCP.

So take Poo melamine-laced pot honey, get fuck here. 

The world never like CCP, side , get it. I'll probably get downvoted bitched oblivion, bought BOXES N95 back beginning Feburary. watching world news ramping halfway across world. Full knowing coming here. Way ahead anyone knew. Called doomsdayer like (I'm laughing hysterically now!) *IN OMNIA PARATUS*

My significant also works construction field. brought home bags N95s. crazy, unprepared folks started breaking gang boxes sites (huge metal storage containers tools) prying open metal, cutting locks raiding N95s. know worked field knew someone did. boss said go it, they'll steal anyway, rather employees them.

They also destroyed port potties, hand sanitizer sprayers installed wall, ripped right off. took bags sanitizer. removed port potties job sites prevent this.

That's makes vaccines platforms - virus vector, mRNA, DNA - exciting. Yes unproven technologies right now, work, vaccines like 95% done encounter new virus. Say goodbye 10 years virus development. Moderna made vaccine 3 hours. Almost zero equal zero. There's nothing adds little extra fun day beach like putting risk COVID maybe sharing crowds.

It would nice US could open things like countries, countries shit together US not. Hitting nail right head there. 

I *don‚Äôt* care get sick. obviously don‚Äôt want get though. *do* care could infect. (god forbid) catch COVID - even think - it‚Äôs isolation immediately, get tested, trace contacts previous two weeks, make awkward STD-esque phone calls people places. Make sure whomever passed aware / same.

I wear mask, keep distance, wash hands, sanitize etc. take seriously. personal health matters great deal that‚Äôs take precautions. But, needs many outweigh needs few.

And folks say can‚Äôt breath mask on: suck fuck up. asthma can‚Äôt breathe best times mask doesn‚Äôt exacerbate it. can, can. Stay safe. Whether protests lead actual spike, one thing absolutely clear... ""health experts"" politicians encouraged everyone protest maintaining people stay indoors done great disservice.

Cancelling research finding viruses come (probably bats, often way intermediate host) still important. 

First there's issue prevention: know coming shot limiting future exposures. Second there's issue surveillance: know coming from, monitor source see what's coming next. Third there's issue fundamental biology virus. understand virus adapts new hosts, shot designing new interventions would target regions virus. 

Imagine able find new coronavirus bat, flag pandemic potential, taking appropriate actions (restricting travel, wearing masks, designing drugs vaccines). viruses (like influenza) time. research done cancelled bullshit political reasons leaves us less prepared country next pandemic. can't count anyone hospital. could died anything. little, late.

Taxi drivers, pizza bakers bus tram drivers risk infected covid-19, according new report Public Health Authority, FHM. primary school teachers, risk appears relatively low, causes teachers rage authority's way calculating.

Taxi drivers diagnosed covid-19 almost five times often occupational groups, pizza bakers relative risk 4.5 times higher. bus tram drivers, risk 4.3 times higher occupations.

In [new report Public Health Authority]( , persons confirmed covid-19 linked registers professional classification Statistics Sweden. People diagnosed period March 13 - May 27 included analyzes. However, health care profession excluded pretext increased testing staff means figures health care cannot compared correctly occupational groups, according authority. 

#We this.

There six occupations relative risk least 2.5 times higher occupations. addition aforementioned, also translators, interpreters linguists, 2.9 times increased risk, restaurant kitchen managers, 2.5 times increased risk, service workers also 2.5 times increased risk (examples profession staff refill vending machines, empty coin boxes parking vending machines, read electricity, gas water meters).

The greatest number cases measured found cleaners, 164 cases, followed primary school teachers 160 cases covid-19. However, impact country's 105,418 teachers calculates relative risk primary school teachers low, 1.1 times higher occupational groups.

#Teacher: ""Can't count like that""

Cristhine Hellsten Kerslow, elementary school teacher one founders Facebook group Teacher Uprising, critical Public Health Authority's way calculating.

- Partly cases basis, also know covid-19 spread clusters parts country affected others. Nevertheless, number cases whole country's teachers knocked out. Instead, one done study Stockholm. possible take cases infected teachers one area combine teachers non-infected areas, says Cristhine Hellsten Kerslow World Work.

She says conversations teachers, hears schools affected covid-19 also got large spread infection.

- see report way Public Health Authority try silence us teachers fall intend open high school again. refer countries Norway Finland also open schools, first got infection minimal level still spread infection Sweden. time, Finland closing schools covid-19, adjusting group sizes reduce risks, Germany know use masks, says Cristhine Hellsten Kerslow.

- this.

The data Public Health Authority's report can, previously reported Labor World , compared Danish counterpart, Danish State Serum Institute, contrary assesses risk infection ""high"" compulsory school. Measurements grades 6-10 showed students infected much others.

**How confidence Public Health Authority look like today?**

- Zero, say, unfortunately, says Cristhine Hellsten Kerslow.

#Not visible statistics

Wendy Isacsson mathematics teacher high school primary school Sk√•ne tells colleague became seriously ill covid-19 stomach symptoms, visible statistics.

- ill eleven weeks diagnosed doctors covid-19 allowed covid-19 test, despite praying praying exclude otherwise. done antibody test became completely despairing came back negative. also means visible statistics despite fact large part covid-19 tested negative antibodies, says Wendy Isacsson.

She recalculated figures Public Health Authority show number infected primary secondary school teachers per 10,000 teacher group, shows primary school teachers 60 percent likely infected secondary school teachers.

- Unfortunately, test little, compare risk high school teachers, distance education, primary school teachers, schools open, imagine get effect closing schools. data comparison insufficient also insufficient compare teachers professions, says Wendy Isacsson.

#FHM: ""There may regional variations""

When Labor World asks Public Health Authority whether appropriate calculate number cases covid-19 teachers knock across country's teaching staff calculate relative risk, given infection occurs clusters, get following response emails investigators Camilla Olofsson:

*‚ÄúThe analyzes describe looks like Sweden whole period, common analysis procedure. mentioned, may local / regional variations within different occupational groups captured.

And hardly anyone wears mask county (or state matter). experienced running businesses ground Thank USA may god mercy soul Probably. depends end phase 3 trials end. Best guess around since double blinded studies we're challenge trials, wait enough people infected show immunity finish. got delayed initial trials UK things gotten dramatically better. trials starting south Africa, Brazil, US. take several months get results. Highest per capita death toll world. Murphy careful reopening. sounds like something fucking Nazi would say holy shit lol understand it, they're getting little bit behind day since week ago. instantly week behind first started getting backlogged. maybe days st point. think it'll get progressively worse time goes though. Scientists say virus come China discovered child strand coronavirus, means original virus came elsewhere. Agreed I'm anti vaxx, I'm nervous long term vaccine rushed. makes think everyone vaccinated? Fact matter people dont believe real, isnt real get shot. vaccine wont much states  plenty teachers go round. Universities pump way teachers required, pay shitty. Higher supply teachers demand teachers.

A strike way drive change. ...and deaths coming anymore - they've started tick - exactly expected number real cases going up. even need gym workout. Furthermore gym last place wanna right now. Americans truly special Broadway actors ""walk around sing onstage,"" evidenced video Cordero posted comment. 

Adele Broadway actor, pop singer. sing/act/dance eight shows week. might ""walk around sing onstage,"" FAR Broadway actors like Cordero do.

""I'm saying single thing guy article about"" - comment direct response article, guy, comment article/guy responded to. March time actually listen them. Even increased testing, numbers going up.

What makes say that? Let's say actual amount cases steady sligthly decreasing. would mean amount confirmed cases would still increasing testing increasing.

Looking Rt deaths pretty obvious situation pretty bad US. want use number misleading? post. Even march feels like forever ago. like bad year babushka doll. Bad year seems like another bad year inside. first lockdown pointless.

This Swedens exact point.

Pending miracle vaccine fall Europe ucked itself. basically went lockdown zero reason. delayed inevitable.

We know Oxford vaccine worked soon. failed places like Denmark, Germany, Norway, etc start shitting paints. study retrospective, random, peer reviewed that's lacks credibility.

The fact Hcq group lower age side effect bad study protocol. significant differences health patients beforehand also contribute bad study is.

The study kind enough list p values though, easily see preconditions statistically significant. Ideally want sample balanced results would part that's statistically significant. Well, Facebook Twitter data droplets transmitted 5G. 9 deaths? Cmon sweden! little bit Affordable education? 


Everyone: ‚Äú ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh didn‚Äôt‚Äù dumb idea, mass bouncing back soon know lung transplant done, kidney transplants put new kidney place; rests anterior abdomen, presumptively easier access gets replaced. man's torso/chest could significantly disfigured going forward. 

I also know kind power one fire transplanted lung, given he's Broadway actor, singing could impacted.

With amputated leg, given he's Broadway actor, dancing certainly impacted.

So sum up, Covid:

* man potentially lost ability sing, ending career

* He's certainly lost ability dance before, likely ending career

* half people undergo procedure still alive five years (per Mayo Clinic), he's basically going begin estate planning income flow

It‚Äôs canceled 2020-2021 Canada getting Oxford vaccine? Another user provided valuable insight question ""Why human beings keep getting viruses bats?""

This insightful provides much needed context what's going think deep-diving bat immune system, certainly interesting, necessary explain number zoonotic diseases bats. think important point crazy number bats, post seem fully appreciate 1,250 bat species existence. one fifth mammal species. get sense this, let ask modified version question human beings keep getting viruses cows, sheep, horses, pigs, deer, bears, dogs, seals, cats, foxes, weasels, chimpanzees, monkeys, hares, list contains species four major mammal clades: ungulates (257 species), carnivora (270), primates (~300), lagomorphs (91). Adding together, even get 3/4 total number bat course, ""number species"" exactly measurement want get sense ""how likely zoonosis develop clade organisms pass onto humans"". might want think (genetic) diversity well, absolute abundance organisms, affect many pathogens circulating as-yet untransmitted humans; then, course, related humans, closely interact humans, affects likelihood zoonotic transmission given pathogen terms diversity, bats young group might think, combined relatively short lifespans would suggest great number generations accumulate genetic diversity. MRCA (most recent common ancestor) bats existed something like 60 million years ago. reference, MRCA bats us around something like 80 100 million years ago, lineage decent time diversify. guess feels counterintuitive many ""bats"" seem weird, specific bodyplan way life, makes feel like relatively sparse twig mammal tree. they're group found amazing, basically unfilled niche occupy quite ago absolutely know measure global abundance bats -- hard organism conduct censuses, extremely limited clearly delineated range -- live absolutely everywhere except polar regions, additionally huge number species weak evidence favour overall abundance large. bit googling find estimates; one example, 18 species bat native UK, two pipistrelles (admittedly commonest) estimated number 3.7 million closely related humans? grand scheme things, fairly closely. mentioned earlier, share common ancestor bats around 90 million years ago. probably consider primates ""quite closely"" related us, primates share common ancestor going back 70 million years ago. Note well viruses incredibly simple hijack fundamental cellular machinery; all, catch avian influenzas, common ancestor birds 300 million years ago. feel strange catch bat diseases, particularly viruses (Ebola, rabies, least 2 SARS closely interact humans? Well, also mentioned, live almost everywhere across globe. I've able regularly spot bats 2 3 cities I've lived keeping eye (and ear!) dusk. experience UK, I've heard many stories people rural areas unable get planning permission tear barns etc. due bats living there, many websites advising bats living attic. Plus, know, fly place, probably fair amount pooping. important remember chain transmission need go directly bats humans. SARS-CoV-1 (the ""OG"" SARS), civets implicated, -2, article mentions, looks like bat coronavirus recombined one pangolin hosts. think last point -- viruses travel multiple hosts arriving humans -- really important keep mind, means get viruses ""from bats"" without interacting closely bats themselves.

What's peoples excuse? Thanks even trying hide u r/realtesla member. FUD. None think fear tactics? body meant kill remove foreign agents, harmful foreign bacteria, foreign viruses, parasites, protests, chemicals, etc. Perhaps asymptomatic carriers like saying everyone bound get flu forever long never take care first place. Another thing...as soon places open, fear mongering news come stated lot new cases popped up. zombie virus, stop pretending need hazmat suits walk hor summer sun. outbreaks 4 states definitely worse compared Georgia, however remember Georgia population 3.7mil people compared 21.5mil Florida. 

Georgia also hit hard, later... central Phoenix-this told (I live another state). probably look hard enough, aware long test lines probably thinks that's testing entailed. tested I've watched select committee article talking about. seem genuinely optimistic vaccine work *some* level, although whether provides full sterilising immunity simply reduces severity symptoms remains seen. sure that. It‚Äôs mainly US-American narrative people people around world also bought it. think failure handling corona opened eyes many us-Americans well. think means, virus dies currently police protected. riots about.

USA #1 üí™üèª‚úä happen decline sign ? actual notification sent ICMR clinical trial Universities actually makes vaccine released August 15 trials conclude successfully (which surely later August 15). Even though inactive virus vaccine therefore safe efficacy effectiveness tested I'd wager two largest vaccine makers world BBIL Serum Institute release vaccine unless 100% sure safety effectiveness. No, am. Tell me. Hence defunding Police terrible idea. already enough money fix shitty training, taking away money resources even worse get literally every raiders fan country join? think that‚Äôs disproven many times. 

And I‚Äôm trying downplay it, it‚Äôs plausible scenario opinion.

The scenario don‚Äôt worry enough - airborne asymptomatic spread. latest research showing even asymptomatic patients noticeable lung changes CT scan. healthy 30 year old gets case, doesn‚Äôt realize lung capacity went 100 percent 95 percent.  lungs filled virus. goes gym runs treadmill 30 minutes. Imagine much virus pumped space.

So shoes even surfaces play, someone infected needs shed large amount virus surface. someone needs come along, touch surface, get nose eyes. enough viral load stick. Certainly that‚Äôs happening shoes delivery boxes. 

It‚Äôs plausible door knobs subway poles potential paths infection, look massive spread believe indoor airborne transmissions due near one asymptomatic carriers far top risk. fever checking deep overnight cleaning IMHO theater waste time.

So tell testing enough people? could test 1000 people everyday, get 90% positive, say ya there's 900 new cases today. truly representative actual number new infections today.

Figure speech mate. is, purpose comparison! wonder there's way put vaccine tranq darts shoot them. Even test? Yea, scary part imo. Positive rates running high 20% massive new case count daily means surge long way go even everyone immediately holed right now. 

Lax prevention non-compliance public steep price pay. fear people continue lax cases continue rise levels healthcare system simply cannot keep with. avoided late winter. gut instinct says lucky time. think China's numbers fake US' right now. country even testing. Also, several times pneumonia deaths normally would cases influenza like illness many states.

We realize surrounding countries China even parts China (Taiwan, HK) low case numbers. Can't see ""mod action"" thing rules page. time, mind screenshot That‚Äôs easy fucking answer. I‚Äôm American. saw Dan Crenshaw blaming protesters increased cases, claiming ""a people bars"" cannot caused increased case loads. flawed thinking, disappointing see coming congressman charge safeguarding functional government. Here's why:

There's 3,000 bars course week, expect anywhere 10-100 people, average, visit bar. ""a people bars"" actually anywhere 30k-300k, more, per week.

Do think 30-300k protesters? Probably not. Moreover, outside many wore masks. shown reduce infections. Whereas bar patrons stuck inside probably wearing masks -- shown increase infections.

It's far likely catch virus bar protest -- moreover, far people bars protesters. slandering posts seem kind lose relevance time goes on.

Like said [retracted Sweden high-risk actually      
Oh wait, talk zPnkr?        
TenYearsTenDays? wonder ""slanderous posts"" talking about... Anyone brain knows Sweden hit hard virus.

I can't believe it... Sweden ""hit hard"" would total bad luck, right? That's Sweden said [back Can‚Äôt put suitcases Coors Budweiser? Ok, wondering mods publish list *words filtered avoid filters* really silly. Cool, get involved trial? get involved? Honestly list would shorter made states DIDNT quarantine ""get one cent"" mean ""let value double one cent"". means ""get one cent"". worded. got cent first day, get second day? hospital capacity. People wont essential necessary jobs like power line work construction fixes one accident means death since wont get hospital help. car accident results broken bone could mean death ambulances backed trauma doctors sick covid. hospitals overrun doctors nurses start quitting get overworked worry care catch it. 

I know people burn icus swap covid icu surge capacity Texas good luck firework injuries. Even outside tho still 6 feet distancing? thats end career... it. shot full benzos haldol delivered right ass. I've heard employers requiring employees cameras bosses could see them. Id hope that's incredibly rare, I'd quit. gov't plenty time set folks reasearch instead went sold stocks. We're fucked. one knows disease is, works, anyone know 37 million dollars spent face masks 3 months later they're telling us wear them. dontcha think greater good gov't would provided said masks? plan doubling nothing? ever done something wrong, deep know best thing do, instead apologizing altering behavior, keep telling (and everyone else) justified? you, bother wearing mask outside.

There multiple different types vaccines I‚Äôm planning due diligence taking one. Okay, would respond ‚ÄúWould prefer opening, closing, opening etc. exactly would do.

Jokes laments bad Trump, governors, officials messed things top comments almost every thread. even really disagree weird rule selectively enforced. Oh, course. last peak idea many people covid. draconian requirements place even get test. time much better idea many people it, spreading slower, hospitals better prepared.

But grows cases real. wondering, hard date given head UK's Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham, told MPs less optimistic jab could protect catching infection. said likely reduce severity symptoms.

She told House Commons Science Technology Committee relatively optimistic vaccine capable treating population soon available.&lt; Fair enough. time got bored too. I‚Äôve thought hugs would safer handshake no? Hands main vector disease, least hug don‚Äôt shake hands talk. Thats probably part it, also seems like surface transmission isnt quite common originally thought... know, back people still denied could transmitted air. general, agree sentiment. However, vaccines entirely refuse vaccines getting sick. Vaccines work herd immunity model. vaccine 100% effective individual receives it. need critical mass vaccine recipients halt spread. enough people refuse, diseases spread refused, also vaccine ineffective. ""Should lock everything now?""

""Nah, let everyone one last big blowout 3-day weekend spread around real good first."" US CDC policy die Covid-19, die Covid-19. mind boggling someone never countries claim understand similarities differences everyone living there. virus care praying drinking beer.

TBH looking President Trump decide whether protect yourself, may fit existence.

No sane person know trusts anything, there's 40% population does. Well sucks. I'm literally Hawaiian Air flight right waiting takeoff. see mom Oahu diagnosed pancreatic cancer. supposed see March can't wait longer. It‚Äôs scientific article. lumps immigrants percentages too.

So yea, Texas great medical system we've kept death toll fairly low, hospitals turn people away, kick early, stop taking non-covid patients, guarantee mortality going skyrocket even try hide numbers ""above average deaths"" count show true humanitarian disaster.

But that's Governor wanted put [Dan charge committee rush reopen Texas. heard few, dozens?

Take collective guilt BS, stick it. Thanks recalling better me. 40% estimate t-cell study basically saying t-cell resistance exists double antibody serology levels. effective vaccine, major issue still supply chain logistics deployment.

There much manufacturing capacity sterile bottles. takes long time get supply ready. comes question gets it.

This exciting doubt though. talking about. procedures make sure fighters camps tested separated other. one fighter tested positive scrapped fight right away. 

They don‚Äôt allow whole card arena. one match octagon one match locker rooms. rest card hotel waiting. You‚Äôre wrong. We‚Äôre already phase 3 clinical trials vaccine we‚Äôre already manufacturing doses. I‚Äôd expect vaccine starts phase 3s month America efficacy numbers end year several aiming October point FDA grant emergency use authorization start dosing almost immediately. needs glasses read briefings. January March, spread disease became serious, cdc actively discouraged use masks among general public.

Surgeon General Jerome Adams even tweeted masks ""not effective preventing"" COVID-19 general public, saying, ""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!""

its wonder ppl dont know believe anymore trusting ppl charge lol mean, that's common knowledge pneumonia, mum marathon took months get normal pneumonia able run again. Exactly that's problem want call murder that's putting blame medical doctors forced choice that's led triage patients. systemic death caused long-term corruption acknowledge argument vilifies doctors fight. fault traded freedoms peace security. became complacent government. bars restaurants go to! Yep. American politics completely broken it‚Äôs asymmetric. reckoning drift toward extremism one party Can't fucking believe going again. competent government less idiots... Great point government may care billy joe went liquor store 6th time week, proper health status. Forgive ignorance, didn‚Äôt know private public hospitals. I‚Äôll definitely need look skeptical initially well. Mainly year experts telling us vaccine far away, CAN‚ÄôT rushed. said sound convincing, I‚Äôm never usually skeptical things like expert opinion made seem like far away, that‚Äôs people unsure. need make clear fuck public top safe people stubborn fuck. FM handled covid well imo I‚Äôm concerned US particularly Give week two deaths start spike. usually lag behind infection rates couple weeks since Covid immediately kill people it‚Äôs fault many animals close proximity poor hygiene cruel barbaric conditions thus increasing transmissibility virus creating perfect conditions transfer. Since beginning virus mess, abundantly clear American's really think themselves. Americans wholly individualistic comes everything. Collectively, give choice want - need (e.g. universal healthcare) instantly turn difficult choice benefits many people. 

The protests masks government infringing rights keeping safe icing cake fucked Americans behave collectively. basically like stating... ""I right die virus one able infringe right!""

Moreover, contrary above, Americans need ""told"" leaders ability know best themselves. Case point: Americans really think virus magically disappeared states started opening economies? Like wtf? Americans states reopened early literally wasted good whole months worth social distancing stay home orders prolonged inevitable fully reopen. 

American society cancer. land ""my freedums"" dreams achieved stating ""fuck fellow American."" I‚Äôm sure end well  That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying though! way help idiot lemmings want jump cliff need herded Shepard. Cuomo good job. 

If Florida, Cali Texas won‚Äôt shut quickly, repercussions behavior kill millions. 

And Christians say god protect them: there‚Äôs god protecting corona, sent help scientists figured shit out, told commit social distancing creating vaccine. We're heading direction Brazil Mexico's 40%+ positivity rates places like Arizona Florida. image context. link original report? I've heard happening Whirlpool too. Need help! I‚Äôm experiencing mild symptoms, could allergies also body aches making suspicious. got appointment test Sunday says need bring ‚Äúphoto ID showing proof in-state residence.‚Äù Problem is, moved month ago won‚Äôt necessary documents get license state another month. do? Right, they're literally human trials speak. even read OP article? untested vaccine released public, they're talking human trials. 

I aware science works, possible vaccination side effects. I'm necessarily even talking waiting others first, that's using common sense. 

The fact is, time vaccine would made available I, It'll likely already taken shit ton people would chance see negative outcomes. 

There's also huge difference describing (initial wariness seen enough people take safely. However many people ""enough"" is), talking about, outright lack understanding science/medicine, refusing take vaccine whatever bullshit and/or conspiracy theory saw YouTube morning, etc. 

I really talking people stay isolation another weeks people start getting vaccinated, sure fine. talking people actively spreading anti-science, anti-intellectual bullshit reddit, twitter, youtube, etc. anticipation vaccine. They're laying groundwork (often faux-) uncertainty uneasiness, viable vaccine hit market, it'll another massive hurdle US get significant portion population GET vaccine. 

These people want nothing create chaos US.

Also, 0.0057% insanely small. Like seriously? Guess we're shutting again... Vaccines never shown good... anything... side effects always worst problem... guess need hope point... Apttmh vaccines never 100% effective. Let's say get one 75% effective received it; 75% would enough develop herd immunity- enough people virus jump eventually would die out.  
But half country took vaccine 75% effective? case virus would still able thrive population even got vaccinated, would never know worked got sick. risk population able feel safe public long time come many would still die even vaccinated.  
To add that, many people can't get vaccinated one reason another depend us develop herd immunity protect them. People need realize Wuhan epicenter virus, China able funnel resources squashing transmission virus. United States, however, one single epicenter. Instead, virus sprung country, made containment difficult. I'm defending him, I'm saying he's good governor. anything worse smart enough realize right thing enough principle it.

My point magic evidence got change mind. realized things gotten bad enough something done mitigate it. 


This highlights issue political system (at least current levels education) incentive right thing. best case scenario state actions taken early enough strong enough prevent virus spread economy suffers, less people die. Unfortunately populace smart enough understand projections person would voted worst confronted armed protestors can't get haircuts ""a hoax"". solved. methods mask re-use new sources easiest-to-make PPE (face masks) taken sharp corners off. However, fundamental problem there's enough factories world make fabric that's later turned N95 masks way addressed. stopped hearing news got bored reporting it. government saying money object contain virus. Here's honest attitude: I'm going take vaccine I'm past caring live die world. opinion capitalism created hell earth generation going able fix without another round war, mass destruction suffering, cares? Fuck it.

Like every week..
What‚Äôs next ? Easter 2029 Brazil too. coerced president change course. Lol going go brilliantly Nope.

Not single period sight.  cases fewer deaths means lower death rate. .25% currently.

Not everyone gets tested, means case number could FAR higher we‚Äôre seeing...

...and yet death rate dropping...probably less flu point. feels like lockdowns ordered political reasons only. hard time believing leadership intent stopping eradicating virus. IMO see dollar signs. wonder country going hell. Even attempt contact tracing, nobody cares. lazy prepper (I agree idea, lazy / poor) - gas mask like 5 replacement filters, bunch N95s. believe conspiracies, always believed see around us world normal eventually go away, reason(s) I'm sure. life ever gone, view brief golden age end, there's people know wtf end.

So got gun / ammo, 50kg rice, lots canned goods, lots water, like gas mask N95s. I'm poor, that's far I've taken it.

I stocking supplies early February. sure COVID yet, saw Chinese Japanese authorities acting, felt ""this could it"". I'm sure ""it"", mean, think honestly, could beginning end. Financial bubbles popping around world coming years, civil unrest... knows bring.

The riots, whilst totally agreed protests, really showed ""bad"" humanity could become even time relative wealth / prosperity... Can't imagine current population would fair great depression dash pandemic years come. Add untimely climate catastrophe? Oh boy.

I actually think nearly prepped enough sustain myself.. gives slight bit peace mind. Zealand seems basically stopped it. recent cases seem international travelers contracted virus elsewhere.

They've done serology study they've tested 175,000 people found 3.2% positivity. like NYC, numbers CDC make ZERO sense.

So population 7 million, assumption would 1 million people teh age 0 45 caught covid. ignored *every demographic, account 1600+ deaths state*, would leave us total infection rate 14% using cited IFR. Now, contradicted fact serology study showed state infected 3.2%. responded saying serology studies count half, really assume twice many infected. Well, still fix sheer impossibility IFR quoted, even *doubled* unknown pool infected would leave us *far less half way accounting disparity*.

This reinforced every fucking hot spot high enough concentration infected use serology studies. Literally every hot spot world would 100% infected use IFR numbers- impossible, first all, contradicts serology studies locations.

So yeah, keep posting silly math. European nobles got peasants farm potatoes requested freeze membership haven‚Äôt charged dime since March. don‚Äôt plan going back gym there‚Äôs vaccine out.

in uncertain terms Porcentaje financiero, d√≠game? even saving corporations. saving state governments bankruptcy federal government abandoned them. I've posted before, much love make fun backward trump-humping states, lot simply stay closed down.

The states G.O.P. control also ones mostly rely sales tax. Now, get wrong. That's totally blinded ideology refuse properly diversify tax base use income taxes. However, that's situation was.

So went lockdown, states pretty much incapable sustaining period time, president Mitch McConnell made clear would government assistance state budgets, could push crooked plan force states bankruptcy. They've masturbating years idea forcing state governments bankruptcy use ill-gotten packed courts destroy pension plans social safety nets.

Once became apparent would leadership help federal government, states forced either give lockdown simply go bankrupt. Make mistake. engineered top achieve end.

Hope stays safe stay safe man :/ shitty situation mean anybody surprised? problem there's huge chunk population give crap. Idk related fact folks power flip-flopped beginning lot folks stopped caring watch Fox MSNBC get completely opposite views severity what.

For example, live Texas governor FINALLY allowed cities/counties put mask ordinances place wanted one (and finally, yesterday forcing everybody state wear mask) would go grocery store see less 50% wearing masks. wearing mask whole answer? No. easy way illustrate much people care. finally 100% fines introduced.

I personally believe people actually took precautions, could open basically everything except bars restaurants okay. ain't ever gonna happen. Maybe asymptomatic people infected twice idk implications referring , read comment right , seem imply Type closest bats probably original strain found readily chicago US Wuhan China way meaning originated US? 

To completely wrong Biggest indicator , time location outbreaks make sensible early infections type travelled USA kind took hold Wuhan . chance circumstances.

But yeah , ignore forest focus individual trees , might see tree pointing horizontally cliff indicating gravity goes sideways something... want vaccine. don‚Äôt care lol mean, important things living. getting hot wings bar isn‚Äôt one them. great example politics, politics alone, killing people. reason border close earlier Mexico afraid political retorts protecting people. god damn stupid. mean massive protests weeks ago.

Just compared say, package toilet paper Costco. package likely loaded pallet forklift depending long sits segments warehouse supply chain may touched individuals.

I'm rambling. Also wanna reiterate agree statement. helped push interesting thought road terms risks I'm willing take life. Tone hard gauge internet. expect government fund them. It‚Äôs pay taxes, people taken care emergency.

It's poorly crafted hard get invested hypothetical person decision making reflect own. YES! thankful live Riverwest, Milw awareness masking bit better. Unfortunately, there's ALOT bars too...so, there's that.
The bar culture particularly strong here, along Tavern Assn. &amp; Lobbying taverns. due respect: lasts long virus 6-12 months.

Stop saying **""IT DURNINT LURST!""** please get educated long immune X strain flu it.

I'm getting honestly frustrated people post things like without understanding every coronavirus planet, 6-12 months mean immunity. lot brainwashing going media game lead dire consequences. media never used report skin colors always now. always see type line ""White person black person"". skin color relevancy anything way listed like this, people every day see ""White people bad thing"" every day years what's going lead to. we're seeing now, lots people mad people color skin. SJW's wanting racial segregation etc.. shit fucked. hospitals done thing....the nursing forums extremely enlightening what‚Äôs really happening. barely believe corona parties. believe kids going bar giving shit bc that's data shows eyes seen. corroborated evidence suggesting people ages 21-35 make half new cases. literally trying tell eyes see incorrect I'm supposed believe bc supposedly work supposed colleagues are. see silly is? almost like trolling me..... might be. like UK WAY better America

lmao dumbass You‚Äôre completely right. China EU completely descended hunger depression!

Oh wait no, they‚Äôve actually mostly recovered corona shut economy weeks. Sure financial impact. Countries 7 12% budget, start working recovering economy. university go plans close could change. two picture two people masked, wearing incorrectly, somewhere NE Valley. Duly noted.

If work hard, probably find someone somewhere around wearing mask, take picture post make point, representative overall observations.

That said, surprise me, already allowed, compliance goes less affluent areas. That's month ago. Hmmm I'm convinced. New York upper East coast hardest hit accounted huge portion cases/deaths. states stayed locked (and also stricter lockdown) probable would've surpressed manageable levels. Instead states saw things calming NY/NJ thought ""fuck it, threats over"" surging again.

Lol cringy edit They're calling ""viral vector"" vaccines here, though I'm still unsure that's proper scientific term. Take another virus (adenovirus) modify contain parts target virus(SARS-CoV-2) want immunize against. immune system recognizes modified parts learn attack real SARS-CoV-2 virus if/when shows up.

You also try ""kill"" virus get body react that. ""killed"" viruses old method: Salk Polio vaccine, example.

You also try weaken sufficiently cause disease. That's attenuated vaccine: They're dangerous immunocomprimised people weak virus, dead one.

If understand things correctly, vectored viruses *also* inactivated can't replicate, either. Modified bunch SARS-Cov-2 spike portions deactivated.

Then there's mRNA vaccines, I'm still trying fully totally grasp work compared relative simplicity discussing others. They're extremely new. they're trying skip virus part attempted virus vaccine getting closer directly exposing virus proteins immune system. They're grand hope long term much much faster way making vaccines.

Do agree above? No. personally think going shut shut down.

But realize minority right now, regardless polls say, due hearing neighbors acquaintances online.

And there's guarantee vaccine. We've never developed vaccine coronavirus still common cold.

Most people get COVID fine. well 99% fine. Wyoming (charging car next mall), nobody beside workers wearing mask mall. Downvoted.. because.. fuck matter people. Actually, sounds like he's really putting foot down. That's exactly going happen.

Happening Washington. dumb. like 3rd person attended rally contracted it?

Once again, many people willingly die supporting Trump. 

I'm even upset. honestly really dumb follow pandemic It‚Äôs pretty pathetic one countries handled worse, it‚Äôs even worse I‚Äôm stuck one two states (the Florida) seem intent letting everyone get sick blindly ignore it. 57k cases US alone Billy Joel full shit. shit? mean Reddit...

57,236 too, headline actually underplaying two fronts.

I expect better NY TIMES honest. copy pasted comment 

I time write everything paper hugely overstated. prove 2-3 months immunity. top antibody data questionable small amount people. immunity antibodies even show drop neutralization ability antibodies 2-3 month timepoints, titers even unheard viral infections.


Show link ? 100k cases next Wednesday. Calling virus BR SYMPTOMATIC. die symptomatic clear cause death. think people coincidentally dying COVID-19 time? like complaining saying people die HIV wasn‚Äôt virus killed them. matter it‚Äôs underlying cause actually cause? We‚Äôre wrong sometimes take chin. really doesn‚Äôt even feel real days. way things moving quickly days. Feels like we‚Äôve lived years last five months. Many Gov. don‚Äôt even try hide agendas. It‚Äôs insane. many hospitalized ? narrative cops kill blacks people higher rate Americans absolute lie.

That's true, although one study made claim year ago.

You read that's talking Mummolo say better way look racial bias police shootings compare incident rates benchmark, population crime rates. instance, 2015 study police shootings found **unarmed black men 3.5 times likely killed police unarmed white men, even factoring local crime Even true, isn‚Äôt good enough reason spread deadly disease kill hundreds thousands more.

Good thing protests havent causing increased rates infection help 50% Americans low-IQ, selfish, narcissistic, contrarian morons think freedoms infringed wear mask. honestly? People abide basic etiquette could put stop save lives, kind deserve whatever's coming them. shame stop them.  Wayne county here. I'd say 90% people see grocery stores masks, I've shopping Fresh Thyme Busch's recently. Kroger bad last time there. Quit continue getting unemployment. worth adverse health effects health priority. I'm sorry happening people taking seriously. ridiculous. one time die. There‚Äôs right wing radio guy remember listening to. whole time Dallas clamoring state reopened. remember abbot saying show gonna safe measured reopening. absolute joke

And what‚Äôs worse anti maskers gonna become anti vaxxers 57,236 cases. 42% higher last Thursday's 40,236.

This along 5% increase deaths last Thursday. Rough day. Says angry person posted ""fuck trump"". 

Even correct takes time help case. still yet get tested complaining testing. go get test done. places tons availability tests. 

And every report online says results come back 2-4 days. 

You call stressed whatever. I'm rather enjoying seeing try change directions try question character know zero bullshit got called on. blind? linked two articles thread, one Nature think reputable. believe fact, minutes since posted that.

1 month ago, US low daily cases (since March). case now. Also note first day time daily US deaths higher day last week (687 vs 653 worldometer). huge difference increase may essentially random, deaths lagging indicator. deaths start rising sustained manner next week would bad sign. Less testing, less cases. Almost like matter people directly affecting them. Yup, response wishy washy pathetic. 

Everything exemption. ""shutdowns"" rolled slowly, course months instead sweeping, consolidated action. reactionary. 

""hmm okay yea Gyms stay open would horrible without gyms.""

**HUGE RISE CASES GYMS

""hmm okay yea think Gyms probably shut down, restaurants stay open long people stay kinda far apart

**HUGE RISE CASES RESTAURANTS

""hmm okay yea maybe restaurants close..indoor dining though, ignore going really anything anyway

There enforcement anything. restriction movement hotspots areas. enforced restriction movement even within hotspots.

Karens dumbass local politicians 0 qualifications allowed make public health decisions. 

They needed shut like ripping bandaid...hard, fast, get quick. Instead half assed util everyone gave up.

Not mention criminally slow rollout testing contact tracing. We're many months still people can't get tests? many states figuring contact tracing? pay $125 go virus. Dude basically going ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look don‚Äôt look don‚Äôt look me‚Äù whole time Damn, Texan would worried kind comments crazy one wants acknowledge declining deaths? It‚Äôs want caught nightmare forever sub. still bad idea. might well reopen Disney World mandatory masks logic. Duh? think every single person who's infected gotten tested?

As positivity rises, guarantee percentage infections we're successfully testing dropping. someone asthma, drives nuts see others trying use excuse wear mask. terrible asthma top wear mask fine. unknowingly get contact inhale virus- fucked too. made mistake saw ad Amazon mouth hole eat mask completely erroneous lol America ain't gonna locking nothing else!

Except Sweden impose restrictions. Bolsonaro wants go back complete normality even though 1,200 people dying covid-19 nearly 50,000 infections occur everyday. late!! funding WHO. Yeah brought us metoo cancel culture, put dangerous people prison gotten influence public eye. raised awareness good causes. Social media bad attention whore. also see high mask compliance deaths per million exceed 1,000 per million. That's level deaths can't ignored know someone died.

Most states yet long way go silly, sociopathic, megalomaniacal douche. phone sometimes sends duplicate replies, especially bad signal. Good luck!!! [some optimism ya  take will, unfortunately due health condition currently unknown can.

[Hours-long testing lines, people still turned [25%+ test positive [89% ICU capacity Every restaurant, bar cafe I‚Äôve Malm√∂ since March followed recommendation(indoors out).

That's new cases European Union. Yeah long term studies, supposed extra cautious new diseases. Hopefully Schaub turns right downplaying he's COVID, really shoudln't making kind comments. irresponsible. transport hospitals boroughs take them. 

Right hospitalizations low that‚Äôs expected change anti mask folks continue ignore mask mandate implemented Anchorage week. 

And without enough contact tracers it‚Äôs going stupid. 

The lines one testing center (drive testing) wrap around blocks roads. Well 100 cars daily. Takes hours hours get test.

Sigh. Anybody arguing need second lockdown completely delusional. need something like Italy early March. Part problem original lockdown U.S. patchwork diff state policies lot people felt apply them. 

We need much, MUCH stricter enforcement time. Fines, citations, jail time, WHATEVER TAKES. Lockdown vaccine, prepare mass infections death, argument. need limit people essential travel away home. Using 'travel papers' would good way implement this. Using app, governments could titrate certain people allowed go grocery store essential services. caught traveling without permission, get hefty fine, exceptions. 

It sounds strict, way stop thing point. Translation: get infected promiscuous pet. locked August complaints loudest end september/beginning october still locked up- every day adds 3 days wait. cities south ghost towns 20201 hospitals collapse.

Serious question realize can‚Äôt answered. Ah, that's part counties, okay. Probably couple those, long...

The voting one creating law prevents voting fairly taboo thing. Could construed voter suppression. given comments Twitter announcement, would conservative folks shouting that.

As someone super pissed turned away essential business lack mask things first ramping up, reason angry mask, lack assistance given. I've seen videos countries offer masks gloves customers. Give stuff, give sanitary trustworthy way, I'll wear it. like I'm forced reuse mask, like pay $1.20 per mask 10-pack, like America produce anything anymore. Mandate something? Take onus providing it.

But watching guys fail understand science perfect science articles damned bibles touted centuries, makes depressed frustrated. People raised sheep, really starting show. maybe world always sheep. :( Easy convince, hard change. would give pause? people still need use restroom, probably indoors. Thats gonna happen awfully long time I'm afraid. Florida even recording tests weekend due holiday. ?!?

I narrowly avoided myself. friend high school flies Tunisia France back US constantly wanted go dinner last night restaurants open here. asked she‚Äôd last 2 weeks. usual ‚ÄúTunisia, France, Philadelphia‚Äù‚Äîso said no. saw Facebook exactly 7 days later hospital COVID-19 positive.

I also know someone got working Elmhurst NYC. 

Someone class said grandfather died it. instructor ended sounding like huge asshole. future country they're playing deadly disease. Brilliant people tell you. Americans realising world revolve around take seriously 10% us dead. There‚Äôs way Reddit bad. rarely see full blown idiots there‚Äôs usually like one comment idiot make it‚Äôs always downvoted one really sees it.

Abbott regarding COVID-19 among Texas Health officials say Hispanics disproportionately getting sick dying disease.

[Coronavirus cases skyrocketing among communities outbreak worsens throughout South West, caseloads growing fastest counties large communities color. would make instantly trust excellent way put it. I‚Äôve thinking thing lately. family incredibly diligent regards limiting exposure best can. go groceries even curbside. We‚Äôve since late February Arizona. Meanwhile seems everyone around isn‚Äôt taking seriously. 

It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating endure pandemic people don‚Äôt care. bother idiots. think *mixed martial arts* essential service. think you‚Äôre asking valid questions it‚Äôs worth liquor store 10% buy three bottles passed 1.5 million. probably overtaken US I'm honest. Think it. consistently get similar number higher cases US despite far less testing positive ratio higher even worst affected US states.

Add leader worse Trump vetos safety measures get passed house representatives. Trump keeps boasting testing, Bolsonaro cannot even plans increase them.

Along that, poverty far worse Brazil US (I'll probably get downvoted think US third world country even though not) many people live Favelas (where distancing near impossible) work informal economy thus covered small emergency aid government giving.

Taking account, along remote areas Amazon patients airlifted Manaus, think Brazil massively underreporting infections thus death toll probably worse US.

I surprised ends one day 50% worldwide cases deaths. China started using soldiers guinea pigs. That's confident are. suppose test subjects means data. Guy literally came register told masks safety compliance brain washed.

The system doesn‚Äôt track location identities experts agree great deal protect individual privacy. Still, system isn‚Äôt getting much traction that‚Äôs probably due privacy concerns.

‚ÄúWiFi, Bluetooth, GPS‚Ä¶ phone lot different radios ‚Äì anything connects makes signal tracking you,‚Äù explained Zar.


Aaron Zar, CEO Silent Pocket
To test out, first called phone outside case rang typical. Then, put phone case tried call call didn‚Äôt go through.


‚ÄúThis obviously pandemic there‚Äôs lot bad it, grand scheme things, think need conscious leads to,‚Äù concluded Zar. ""Garbage in, garbage out.""

- George Carlin idea keep conspiracy theory even today.

If today February, conspiracy theorist might **happened wrong**. chance COVID-19 spread bad become wrong. anti-vaxxers, people around anti-vaxxers take vaccine, anti-vaxxers almost safe **happened wrong.**

But July can't brain wash countries agree one thing. fact, first moment history countries, west east. agreed threat. reported effects COVID:

* Long term lung scaring associated decreased lung functions
* Possible brain tissue effects (due likely blood vessel virus)
* Long term memory cognitive effects
* Low energy
* Heart tissue scaring

Etc. etc.

You want disease matter age fitness. opened schools (look up) i‚Äôm American understand proper government funding Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll excuse dumb ass illiterate American, don‚Äôt speak us dumb fuck.

Secondly, blaming Trump virus came China. blaming Trump , talking people refusing wear masks.

To say America problem, shows fucking dumb are. takes one case begin spread again, don‚Äôt care send private jet back, think guy came small boat 25 others didn‚Äôt catch probably occurs hourly. isn‚Äôt single country everywhere once. Simple that.

Sadly, beginning believe matter everyone gets this, if. anymore. Haha WTF *It's different winter flu!!*

**-Idiot**

None side effects normal, all. Stop treating flu. Also, summer, know season President said would disappear by. nearest beach Arizona Rocky Point, Mexico, Gulf California. 65 miles border. Popular tourist spot. Fauci's prediction 100k/day right around corner.. trending upward massively lower number couple months ago. BLIP. See response. Also, according docs actually COVID (my kid well) best could tell without testing me. means treating lightly, quite ill worried kid. yes way personal someone comments know-it-all without realizing actual situation back here. zero patriotism, expat whatever would different random dude probably can't even read Dutch. Regarding protests, spread coronavirus? Yes, 100%. one prevalent transmission vectors? No, don‚Äôt think so. NYC successfully shaming people even attend family‚Äôs funerals. protests lot retail opened illegally people started give less fuck. think trend happened country. Approving protests indirectly gave people permission engage risky activities. Dead people work. buy shit. pay taxes. understand think killing people save economy. Increasing Wealth Gap: ""The 1% horrible!""

Starving Kids: ""We need build awareness!""

Gang Violence: ""The lower class ruining country!""

Corona Virus: ""Oh they're fucking stupid."" point valid well reasoned, one exception. could predicted current state Florida. may re-election strategy. people scared go polls, inner cities vote. Upstate open bars restaurants inside dining. also like 2% immunity drawing tourism cause open. College campuses also planning open residentially. 

I see bad things. news, water wet. FFS USA!!! would $500! know that.. problem is, half country want listen it... quite another yes ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ south please take seriously literally did. linked it. keep reading.

And link shut fuck up, honestly.

Cannot stand people lazy educated.

It job homework. wise opinion, current Florida mitigations prevent spread older demographic?

Also, believe dead people metric valid measuring negative effect Covid19? metrics suppose might relevant? Florida those? ""So said people, slow testing down, please."" Yes, thank you! 7 day average comparisons, much better single day figures. rebuttal debate. Teachers talking going back, safe classroom, etc.

I literally work school half people socialize teachers. Go teacher subreddit teachers talking worth going back.

It's debate. something teachers talking about. Believe not, teachers concerned safety safety loved ones. Hard believe, know. People freaking 3,2,1... No, know also can't find online. something differs every state think Herd immunity % world record attempt. ~~Instagram co-founder~~ _Everyone_ built coronavirus tracker says it‚Äôs showing concerning spread levels

FIXED hey, could always worse. could livin streets wiff ya booooyfriend. (Sorry, recognized Teen Mom sub haha) sister tested positive lives parents, good chance well. terrifying since February feels like it‚Äôs crashing down. Scared parents going need hospital care won‚Äôt available. better give bottle tequila $65. seems though US spree setting new record everyday now. even want think next weeks numbers TLDR: ‚ÄúThe bad news can‚Äôt uninstall it, good news it‚Äôs anything,‚Äù said Feibus.

To see feature iPhone, go Settings Privacy Health COVID-19 Exposure Logging.

The feature activated install official COVID tracking app right now, least U.S., aren‚Äôt many them. OMG comment made sick :) yeah good burger fries minus food poisoning would good 2020, lot southern Americans Carnival cruise ships. Thank you! safe 4th well!

He's FOX person, he's bro (like watching Barstool Sports day kind bro). think kid Marti Gras video like ""if get Corona, get corona"". That's basically lol. idea dude, I'm Spain. guys fucking though.  archive [http://archive.is/qz3Os](http://archive.is/qz3Os) think cities generally outdoor seating. I'm suggesting opening public places, *temporarily free*, leveraged businesses impacted virus. Ideally, would happen places ton people already going there.  

For example, lot beach parking lots periodically closed. spaces allowed used impacted restaurant offer outdoor oceanview dining experience? ‚Ç¨50 all-inclusive package know saying counting chickens hatched?

Yeah applies. Especially recent case explosion US yet caused deaths. lag 2 weeks. awfully reminds thread /r/kreishust international corona league standings. laughed told wanted comedian. ain‚Äôt laughing !-( Masks least anyone minimize spreading disease. That's fact.

Texas passed mask mandate. Trump rally today masks optional. publicly refusing wear masks rooms full people months. Absence mask like maga hat, showing support current admin. lots reports people's O2 stats great right code get vented covid. tricky hope U.S. longer international influence this. countries take us seriously, we're fucking joke. half would also claim it'll hoax.. incredibly rare. Hence heard news instead hearing much common scenario full recovery. Bummer, jet fuel + crew prob cost upwards 30k flight. Yes, anxiety natural right now. try let consume you. best. agree you. isn‚Äôt going great here, like Europe wants start pointing fingers pushing countries people away based best numbers. isn‚Äôt fucking contest. whole world coming together, away governments politics. together humans. Covid dosnt respect boarders Hatred defined it? work English emergency department? do, tell i've buy while.... American colleagues can't say same. eat ass, ignorant yank! you‚Äôre desperate understand situation PM Also.  Nothing whole thing, part it, long time. think proper quarantine.

Most people encouraged stay home.

Might wrong though, really done proper research basically stayed inside house past 6 months I'm Iowa. Hardly anyone wearing masks. makes literally zero sense. British government anything right terms covid. least, nothing right right time, needed dragged measures, hence much worse death rates european countries. PM, all, moron.
That said, plain fact current situation way better US, cumulative death rates mean nothing talking future travel exclusions we're lucky earthquake California slide Pacific. Maybe give Texas back Mexico? sure New York. say this... that‚Äôs cheap! remember got dragged day club drinks $65, pretty big bartender heavy pour... Thank you! You‚Äôre probably right. Anxiety one hell thing. appreciate helping out! Go ahead let's practice people let know. you‚Äôre another idiot thinks parties same. Head r/enlightenedcentrism. everything conspiracy kind hurts credibility Also backed common sense. sucks shitty god money. Alright fucking real here, New York 40% time could really test showing symptoms. I‚Äôm sick downplaying this, sorry sarcasm can‚Äôt seen easily days since we‚Äôre living land full ignorant idiots making thing worse also commenting like there‚Äôs nothing wrong, couldn‚Äôt tell comment 100% meant sarcastically. I‚Äôm seeing innocent people hurt suffer due outright idiocy ignorance general population, patience thing wanes. 

Could states south ignoring pandemic maybe not? Wonder much paid local officials bypass 14 day quarantine. I'm sorry parents. group living situation Maryland pretty bad beginning. nextdoor neighbor continued visit wife memory care home MoCo despite Hogan's ban visitors. showed one Sunday find coughing staff told infections, one tested, restrictions visitors, one wearing PPE. took week calling DOH Hogan's office get tested. I'm glad feeling better. won‚Äôt. won‚Äôt need hospitalized. Vegas partners probably slew young. let circle 40 days land, like olden days? flatten curve? hospitals continue flatten curve enough virus longer endemic. 

So ? 

I heard motto first time, switched one mantra another, stopped paying attention.

Clearly, bought wholesale. Oh God, sah cah toa kill now. Covid, I'm ready gonna start talking trig Yeah guess LA confused LA county many cases. live LA proper people wear masks. I‚Äôm sure what‚Äôs going county though went japanese eat restaurant, ate much actually got stomach pains. times show comment resulting laughter, moment, half crying half pain. anyone someone household get virus others get it? haven‚Äôt left house since March except go walks. dad goes grocery shopping every two weeks. mom medical professional elective procedures recently started seeing patients again. wears full PPE n95, gown, goggles, shield, etc. 

Everyone house zero symptoms except me. recently developed mild cough. Like tickle throat type cough. really bad seasonal allergies, wasn‚Äôt worried. taking allergy meds tylenol still persisted. mom got tested three days ago. antibody/fingernail prick test came back negative, swab test hasn‚Äôt come back yet. 

Say come back negative. possible one member household get COVID others it? Like possible didn‚Äôt infect her? sounds really unlikely considering haven‚Äôt left house. Plus we‚Äôre close contact, talking, laughing, yelling, sharing bowl popcorn, hugging, etc. i‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôm wondering get tested myself. 

Has anyone experienced one person house get it? Everyone going block American travel.

I can't disagree them. Well, would express concern 66% occupancy well? concern appears caused knowing normal ICU occupancy is. Bolsonaro one politicians world worse Trump Yeah. know unfollow thing. Frankly though, idea often even use site. Thanks unwanted advice, though, stranger. Yeah dude keep editing posts ... shows *. link initially gave different one.

And said times yes, responded slow commonly accepted really. However data knowledge *right now* everything control. exactly point?

And favor, put new thoughts sources replies go back editing previous posts make look better. ironic really, whole argument based hindsight posts! Hey technically HIV/AIDS killed 400,000 people US (between 1980 2000). 1/3 deaths 4 months! bad!!! ^/s France anything obviously stupid (by opposition to, say, UK US) got things right sufficient crush it. might one (of many) possible measures bad things go even stupid. masked schools unmasked? Cause teachers want masks either lmao ""The sun kills viruses!"" Dude idiot, tel go 4th July rebel. Recommend wearing mask certainly listen.

They trying pass blame youth without acknowledging lack guidelines youth follow. Since vast majority us never leave country, honestly doubt many people care . know? India millions cases reporting.

""We closing border Injuns"" - tRump next week... in, bears still shit Pope's hat, however goes. Governor wanted say think he's saying? 100% success rate 3 months?


Math+ includes cortisone steroid, vitamins anti-coagulants try curb key challenges caused virus - blood clotting inflammation.
""We've months now,' Dr Varon said, ""it's working charm"".
He much believes hospital's 100% success rate nearly three months Math+. know travel history using different passport? Guess time pack move like I've planning do. Shame them. Call it. 

If serious respiratory problems pandemic respiratory virus anyways.  Thanks, feel even better now. good 4th! shittiest part basically things control reopened. reopened slowly keeping bars closed, requiring face masks, can't imagine would seeing surge now. lots places Arizona seemed nothing different reopened. work bar, high-end restaurant still ignorant old ass people coming talking shit wear masks much love trump. know fucked find hoping people catch covid. That's way learn. make pay visit? testing? also told people go except food seem apply Cummings. also made mandatory wear masks public transports area one bothers, including drivers. Saying shut mean much basically none enforced. lift last bit lock weekend said singing banned weddings wonder follow rules enforcing it?

My point stop defending government. said 2 different things. Depends country believe. Brits allowed come Finland long time, sure recently changed though. mean said mouth definitely may changed tune Bill‚Äôs episode vs Jon‚Äôs. also didn‚Äôt watch Bill‚Äôs don‚Äôt know deep got it/the context. concern quantity point kind like misuse position authority. apply means they're richest ones they're at.‚òª consult corrupt real estate developers No. thought comment April Fool's joke. That's dangerous fucked pandemic! Saying 99% people survive without ""extreme problems"" extremely irresponsible, unless think markedly higher propensity stroke, heart attack, extensive lung damage recovery 'hiccups' feel you. Recent grad BS criminal justice. Everything find commission call centers shit like that. I‚Äôm panicking. Source that? doubting you, want read means 1 690 people infected.

Not exactly true, recovered longer infected Pushing bill? who, republicans? it‚Äôs job Senate G0P‚Äôs job? Get grip. Place blame currently lies, G0P.

If I‚Äôm unpaid spokesperson Enlightened Centrism, even worse. walked past corona positive person surgical mask n95 surgical mask risk? least CV ""the one"" everyone fears. fatality rate like MERS contagious like CV would bring world knees long long time. casualties injuries left behind CV nothing like population cleaner. watching Johnny Quest searching running mate? Everyone whining they're considering pnumonia mild symptom. case? rich fucking jerk americans. finally tables turned. It‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúwacko‚Äù Token american hates himself. Hahaha Mexico wants keep US out?! That's honestly fucking hilarious. fucked Covid response bad Mexico wants keep us out. covid quarantine odd one though, coming Finland UK seems 2 week quarantine obligatory, rather strongly encouraged. Like going work expected, meant try hardest use public transport. Hey, that's great, clear, thanks. try next time I'm blocked. huge spike country 4th bet.  think what's surprising (or depressing) sheer amount people stupid US. Everyone knew huge chunk stupidity states (just look elected), think lot world thought vocal minority rather appears nearly half population. Trump finally got wall. Covid-19 wall. close everything Mason-Dixon line. used standing milk crate corner. said everyone would get it, insinuating everyone would catch virus eventually, everyone would eventually understand need wear masks?

Because I'd like see reasoning latter, data I've seen says people suddenly 'wake up' start wearing masks before. r/subsifellfor Makes wonder paying tax for. Combination of:

\- Younger people getting virus, likely recover, take longer die.

\- much information treating virus March/April, people likely recover, take longer die.

\- Florida absolutely fudging numbers. 600% increase pneumonia deaths year? Sure, Florida. 100% this. 

Marc Maron, you? typically tested longer period human trials reason, assess things? looked like pretty good. Netanyahu already said they'll reimpose lockdowns needed. environmental impact millions discarded masks felt decades.

The hard-core anti-crowd happily invited try argue point ventilator tube stuck throat. needs mask buy air??? Here's saying responsible thing exercise freedom assembly pandemic over. supports goal spirit protests wishes everyone would stay home. Sweden built little herd immunity well. temperatures go autumn, especially current attitude, may well get swamped. case, spring lowered life national expectancy naught.

Norway lock-down, sparing lives bringing infections near zero. makes outbreaks easier detect control. Treatment improved recent months, means people higher chance survival stays hospital shorter. know much prevention, protective equipment, drugs, treatment, hospital beds, etc. better supply. people know do. short, second wave quite improbable even occurs Norway still victims first one.

Meanwhile, Sweden still piling dead hardening denial stance. deaths chosen certain, game gamble. Elsewhere virus practically eradicated, need hold straw hope - life, choose life. merely hope save face. Aburd right... wouldnt know 900sqft... would expect fingers lower oxygen levels body, especially get cold fingers lack circulation. strange... Eh, think still come ration care get lot manpower support. least acting, Florida hand...... going go history books considered shit hole country ? Oh ya definitely dumbass move, bring good guest every while. According Google, US deaths per 1M people. really know jack shit. Thanks encouragement. someone could seen coming. /s Good point, apologies. Pushing bill? who, republicans? it‚Äôs job Senate GOP‚Äôs job? Get grip. Place blame currently lies, GOP. I'd love know definition 'normal person' droping 15k dollars flight within realm possibility... That's half yearly income single flight ""fallin place""

Let know that's clear. seems optimistic, even accounting 3x higher antibody count recovered patients incredible, hope pass testing phase one peace I'm keeping hopes shutdown supposed long enough flatten curve. states complied reopening downward trend positive tests two weeks everyone would wear masks (as recommended since early April) gather large groups/social distance, might see spikes there, nothing like we‚Äôre seeing now. really, might reply comment there.

Us containing assures international border absolutely stay shut. long time. don‚Äôt blame you. realize strategically speaking, Trump GOP Jonestown attending conventions great way drink cool aid. It‚Äôs even optimism point! They‚Äôre manufacturing speak!  Surely people could understand message, medical staff get priority. time people hoarding face masks trying sell lot amazon. vaccine works want vote man running Trump two-person race, write Prof. Sarah Gilbert. WA department health quietly released report showing expected results pandemic.

The expect hundreds suicides drug overdoses. expect tens thousands people PTSD.

They expect summer likely worst time many people's lives.

It oddly comforts though thoughts feelings normal. 

The lockdowners, covidiots, conspiracies, normal.

A pandemic natural disaster super slow motion.

Go running, survive.

1-2 years go concerts shake hands hug. Hundreds thousands Americans dead life go on. think it‚Äôs things. We‚Äôre testing way often catch earlier back March, damn near impossible get test absolutely needed (usually hospital admission). Doctors also treating differently March, back jumping ventilators quickly likely caused lot avoidable deaths. Hospitals overrun point...but tipping point reached Texas, AZ believe right well FL likely follow suit. happens death rate big, big trouble dont want wait home, luckily goverment handled case efficiently longer lockdown here. people could decent thing wear masks, wash hands generally selfish survive without rushing potentially lethal vaccine out. first time rushed vaccine done harm good. Additionally exaggerated, minimum standards safety purposes. 

Look wish quick way too, cant wish quick solution reckless.

Just say one time, vaccinations all, family. u bashing people trying safe keep everyone safe. Saying u problem spreading around cuz u personally believe it. sad scary u care little. u though right? 

Show proof kind that's real, real proof people think. u sound stupid locked u spread covid kill people. 53% elected officials run unopposed every election. Who's fault that? I'm saying take little responsibility stop blaming others. criminals power need removed going without looking faults system control. America turned oligarchy due corruption. would rather look fix mess instead screaming world injustices. Yea Chicago I'll also chime also google ADHD well Autism, there's lot overlap. change setting sound like autism ADHD. new surely warrants extensive research dont think? Isnt 5 years vaccines already years research beforehand anyway? Surely put way point not? new type vaccination technology makes less research needed? One years extensive not.. cant speed someones ageing process see long term affects you? get it. done. point lost you. Nothing come discussion. serious ? Hurr durr soreness can‚Äôt worse dragging arms ground walk. It‚Äôs like rain wedding day There‚Äôs handful ECMO machines state. hell hospital get many? sounds reasonable me. Shut non essential business hot spots, would really hard time swallowing another SIP order less hard hit state. I'm trying pick here, want understand paradoxical rhetoric using:

1. Throughout conversation, talked undesirable need raise taxes order allow students parents stay home.
2. Yet here, argue government **should literally relocate house millions elderly immunocompromised people (as incredible amount students live grandparents immunocompromised)** isolated section 8 housing **that exist would need built specifically purpose**. would public work project beyond scope anything done *human history.* go UNLESS starts showing obvious symptoms. Even though he's middle-aged, many display mild cold/flu-like symptoms. starts coughing &amp; chest pains time go &amp; watch condition. Make sure gets tested immediately. he's god understatement Universal Basic Income Honestly, masks worked way person wearing protecting care. I'll wear mine dumbass get killed protecting themselves. Somehow though, dumb mother fuckers *still* get wear masks others around you. body putting risk. fine rest us covered, get others sick fucking selfish assholes. makes sense. economy seems operate better live citizens, versus alternative. think guys arguing point FYI. oh boo hoo poor missing significant other, get Gotcha. Thank context. 

Don‚Äôt tell anyone ‚Äî like flag ours! sister baby last week. it‚Äôs scary fuck got lot comments full vitriol. comment pleasant change pace. love stupid self. Gives new meaning term hoodrat. Thanks good egg. mom lives rural South Carolina, hour equidistant Charlotte Columbia, feel you. miserable. Sure, absolutely, 100%, gosh know lot. stable genius! Apple actually pretty positive stance privacy. 

Facebook google would worst, since actively use trackers ad purposes. Stop testing. problem AZ. People even waiting line many hours tests run out. need fewer tests. /S  city starts 10 days strict lock-down almost 100 days lock-down followed weeks ""Unlocking""

I left home looks like years. Neighbour hand enjoys daily walks without mask, lockdown never went walk surge July 4th weekend major impact universities schools. time wave hits full late July/August. already trending wrong direction lot worse. Truth. Sounds like Mexico going build walk going pay it. also wonder long trump buys world supply  Hahahahahahaha illegal Texas go work someone household tested positive. must get tested wait results. even test comes back negative still must isolate untill cleared contact. employer sued oblivion. Eventually. don‚Äôt buy conspiracy theories I‚Äôm 100% pro vaccination. I‚Äôm one people won‚Äôt first wave vaccinations. absolutely intend getting one see enough people get one adverse reactions. I‚Äôm chronically ill immunocompromised don‚Äôt feel comfortable getting new vaccine know nothing hasn‚Äôt tested masses. 

The social media dum dums may forgo getting vaccinated delusions even 50/50 split early days give us herd immunity. millions people vaccinated fine, people follow suit. work construction it‚Äôs tough wear masks especially heat, cause safety glasses fog up, we‚Äôre warned everyday osha expecting full compliance mask wearing show up. know read doctor did? $4000 could fly San Francisco London non stop fly back, still $2000 left. would literally cheaper fly another country that's side world treatment treated US. daughter another baby NICU her. 

Mom drove csection hospital better (and baby 10+ pounds) 

Can't blame real thing. People realize far people come treatment Duke UNC ultra welathy aren‚Äôt afraid.

If need hospital bed one immediately. Tell get tested today.

If want visit planned, quarantine gets test results back (sleep garage, keep contact limited outdoors 6' apart, sure wash hands touching shared surface kitchen/bathroom, etc) There‚Äôs debate choices really majority choice all.

I know state much blatant gerrymandering it‚Äôs sickening. majority absolutely represented. Can‚Äôt speak states. Yeah, reminds Trump read Imperial Study tone dramatically changed. Exponential growth looks like nothing while, maybe something, everything. Yeah bad things, too!!!

/s thinking whole thing simple. Two ppl claiming two things. One said mask, said mask. risking mask...slight discomfort, ichy nose, etc. risking mask...hospital stay, death, killing parents etc.

It seems like mask crowd going 7$ pot. right win almost nothing, lose gone. *shrug* corona related üòÇüòÇüòÇ  us vote him, friend. mean don‚Äôt enough evidence claim 6 month old virus impairs rest life? Ridiculous. /s Stay home stay safe can. idiot crowds also flocking store work in. think dread results yet another holiday. ones thinking, anyway. instead choose display conspiracy theory, hiding even discussion instead reading ""compelling breaking news"", actively make people avoid think nuts. Bravo. Politics definitely find consistency truth here.   open discussion returns Reddit, I'd like know masks useful protests celebrations.

Sure. would like discuss? Besides assumptions?

u/LillyEpstein made comment Mayor DC, didn‚Äôt say word protesters rioters without masks.

Which sweeping incorrect provide ADA text (Sorry COVID QUESTION. LAST THREE MONTHS WE'VE DEALING PANDEMIC. WE'VE SEEN THOUSANDS PEOPLE STREETS THISWEEKEND CLOSE QUARTERS. CONCERNED YOU, CONCERNED RESIDENTS COVID SPIKE RESULT LAST COUPLE DAYS?  DOCTORS -- DOCTOR'S HERE, I'M GOING LET RESPOND. UNTRAINED VIEW, I'M PHYSICIAN, WE'RE CONCERNED. WE'RE CONCERNED TYPE ACTIVITY HAPPENING ACROSS COUNTRY. PEOPLE TRAVELING ACROSS COUNTRY.

So summarize, Mayor DC noted people masks protest, ability peaceful lawfully assemble guaranteed First Amendment.

Dr. Nesbitt echoed things Mayor noted people still gathering large numbers outdoors, practicing safe social distancing, face coverings replacement individuals ability properly social distance.

(Oh, Mayor DC also recommended people participated protests get tested echo's Dr Fauci's comment interview DC Talk News station time hear see congregation large crowds time geographic area active infection transmission, perfect set-up spread virus sense creating blips might turn surges,"" Fauci said. ""So get certainly risk, would say confidence, see congregation crowds,"" said, ""particularly situation lot confusion little bit chaos, people running back forth, taking masks off, close proximity, pose difficult situation,"" Fauci said. ""We right peaceably demonstrate, demonstrators exercising right...it's important exercise constitutional rights able demonstrate, delicate balance, reasons demonstrating valid. yet, demonstration puts one additional risk.""  said public health officials like caution protesters wear mask keep times go things mind, see Mayor DC Fourth July celebrations. large crowds, people practicing social distancing, people without masks. also Constitutional right watch fireworks display.

I hope clarifies /u/LillyEpstein's comment someone clear me. according guy, can't get Covid wearing mask protest get covid wearing mask celebrate 4th July outside. someone explain possible?

Have sufficiently answered question /u/ctr1999? top health experts recommend social distancing mask. I'd say stage already set play ""Disaster"" already progress. Yeah, they‚Äôre basically collating numbers DHHS release next day lump. first line vaccine demonstrate (hopefully) science-suspicious family. Probably dim hope since won‚Äôt even wear masks we‚Äôll see. Americans spreading virus months. Yep! Gaggles them, forget Privileges Karens coming town! Generally common pretty much every market still common cities find people selling dealing living fish sometimes chicken. government putting strict rules living birds due fear bird flu though. However least urban area really need local people know handful (if still exist today) markets selling living mammals major source animal human infections. Taking old USA Brazil approach see  Hey lets blame. plenty go around state local leaders well. I‚Äôm concerned rushed production. vaccine may perfectly safe, rushed production may problems (like materials quality bacterial contamination) One huge success lockdown bought time learn treat patients. people survive medical professionals better understanding treat them. owe lot people working every day treating testing learning Would survive bill Edward Jenner's vaccine developed quicker However, researchers found ‚Äúno evidence¬†that urban protests reignited Covid-19 case growth three weeks following protest onset.‚Äù

That's first article. notice disagreed title article? Lack evidence != Evidence Lacking

And data showing protests ""contribute"" spread. three weeks well evidence greatly contributed spread.

The protests effectively replicated [event kicked spread every major city America. takes weeks (because incubation time) data reveal outbreak causes. one shouldn't. Oxford University profit :) think mostly useful idiots never read source.

They see twitter account claim link article go spread without understanding they're saying.

At least that's what's happening US. ‚ÄúOne person claims‚Äù non-story thing already proven safe; else thinks damn torpedoes start handing out? Yup, I'm east Placer, I'd say less 50% people masked. surprisingly, State Jefferson country, everyone stubborn. asthma live immunocompromised family member, make point going one supermarket town enforces mask policy places. obviously never rural places. many lives lost potentially life-saving drug politicized reflexive contrarianism anything Trump advocates? Retrospective case study.

This makes far less reliable. Well, folks, God‚Äòs country. live idiocracy. would water crops good old Coke, you‚Äòd alrighty. think OP thinks miracle cure either, he/she stating impact effect reducing covid cases significant amount everybody wore them. Well you‚Äôve got point, I‚Äôd bring pools packed like means casinos inside likely well. That‚Äôs much bigger danger two, neither one smart you‚Äôre absolutely right outdoors gives atleast *little* hope won‚Äôt complete disaster. 

For life cannot understand many people insist going like there‚Äôs pandemic hand right now. I‚Äôm bracing stupid shit we‚Äôre inevitably see weekend find gain function research create it... Anyone say anything care internet Still residents citizens returning overseas COVID-19. returning Kiwis held border quarantine facilities min 14 days.

There currently evidence COVID-19 anywhere outside border facilities. 

Imagine Secret Service forced expose like this. Like us probably can't wait administration fucks off. YMCA kept charging go. asked said sent emails tell us cancel want charged said never emailed specifically. Thankfully got money cancelled SOUNDS FUN well, reasoning i‚Äôd lot sympathetic pretty sure it‚Äôs bc they‚Äôre siding mask folks Whataboutism, also known whataboutery, variant tu quoque logical fallacy attempts discredit opponent's position charging hypocrisy without directly refuting disproving argument. Whataboutism particularly associated Soviet Russian propaganda.¬†Wikipedia

Logic:¬†Logical fallacy

Tactic:¬†Propaganda technique

Active period:¬†Cold War‚Äìpresent brought term months ago corrected others said triage. mean, technically running office, said nothing dealing pandemic so... technically keeping promises gave voters?  anything notebook compares MMA talks 5 minutes instead.  CDC testing indicates 9% tested positive. Herd immunity estimated 70%. Get bulldozers ready, it‚Äôs going mass graves Texas, Florida Arizona unfortunately. Wear masks everyone! fair travel warnings places U.S. bad drinking water potential violence while, least Switzerland. ‚ÄòWhen comes increase coronavirus cases, medical professionals can't say.......‚Äô

Or won‚Äôt say, like Work home, suppose. US denies foreigners baseless claim disease ridden countries.

Foreign countries deny Americans legitimate claim disease ridden country.

Irony, thy name COVID. Maybe pay wall modern ‚Äúlet eat cake‚Äù moment. every single person know uses filter ac unit. lot use filter level blocks viruses. i'm buying AC spread see real evidence. parties gatherings outside.

But really responding about. responding California wearing masks though

But come back ever indeed easier go grumble teenagers outdoor parking lot. Surely problem youth's moral corruption!

Is highkey snark even called for, dude? There's mutual exclusivity, zero-sum game, mitigation efforts greater sum parts. Also:

1. moral corruption, stupidity youth age (most us fortunate enough suffer affliction pandemic), complacency part respective supervising adults.
2. **Both things problem.** One thing problem make less problem vice versa. In-home family friends gatherings problem. Kids socializing spreading across households problem. One might even say one contributes other. Taken together cluster-maker.

So chill fucking geezer pointer Around 80% members don‚Äôt ever show normal times. Charging don‚Äôt come literally business model. still think much tighter restrictions US, bars many inside venues remain closed long possible think, think India recently California show unsustainable lockdown is. Initially India completely control despite vicinity China praised one ones able control it, soon open begins get hand. Though California still hasn‚Äôt gotten NYC situation yet may shut avoid it...Masks going big part beating thing...I think proper way handle would open couple weeks time every couple months people protesting lockdowns disregarding mask mandates ruining things everyone sure last twenty years much proud of. Oh, he's deeply irresponsible. spend much fund public health departments? relying personal responsibility leads lot dead people. many times half informed write shit study going posted?

Actual conclusion data: younger improves chances, even take HQC. right. meant nature wins time. tens debates otherwise intelligent people, realized values they‚Äôre looking confirmation, reality disturbing factor imagination. expert opinion, 2nd degree data, logic.

Probably versatile. sure lot closer fights. couple debatable decisions. mention plenty nut kicks eye gouges mix. Everyone keeps saying USA worse compared Mexico, way testing here, positivity rate low single digits.

Mexico doesn‚Äôt test anyone unless you‚Äôre bad shape need hospitalized. president considers ‚Äúwaste resources‚Äù otherwise, probably means don‚Äôt enough tests. positivity rate 50%. probably tons people died covid never tallied covid deaths never got tested. mortality rate three times normal rate, year year. US cause mortality rate actually LOWER usual right now.

Everyone slamming US talking Mexico handling far better simply handle facts. Lol soothe us want ‚Äúdoomers‚Äù right beginning. I‚Äôve already lost friendship saying millions die. will. Worldwide, average everything, 5% death rate. Around worst way beginning 7-9% areas, came learn treat it. 

Of 200,000 positive tests, pretty accurately estimate 10,000 die. That‚Äôs cases know about. 

The deadliest aspect virus time delay. takes 4-6 weeks super spreader event really evaluate death toll. gives us false sense safety makes much difficult, psychologically, connect behaviors outcomes. seeing real impact Memorial Day states it‚Äôs catastrophic.

When comes specific virus, dangerous thing possibly underestimate it. Downplaying danger known murderous. scared. isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon. It‚Äôs zoonotic meaning vaccine cure insanely difficult impossible. It‚Äôs never going ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù - stay. 

You helping one downplaying it. isn‚Äôt hard prevent - masks + social distancing + washing hands - improve odds even massively reducing often go out. less see people safer are.

Oh that's right dozen. people getting away shit like this? review data conclude younger improves chances, even take HQC. actual conclusion. miss dim sum Ethiopian often, you‚Äôd still need everything CDC says it‚Äôs basically useless. good chance they‚Äôll take risks regardless.   Jersey Shore open, I'm fully expecting spike New Jersey. allowed land countries either. point, going strict lockdown, otherwise stop. masks unnecessary whole time.

""My freefall going well -- guess never needed parachute"" It‚Äôs good theory. means we‚Äôre going start seeing spike Northeast around October...  world difference anti vax vaccines existed use decades millions people, brand new vaccine less year serious clinical trials. realize Covid, dangerous, sub 1% mortality rate, even lower younger demographic.

There‚Äôs real chance taking largely unproven vaccine could dangerous covid you‚Äôre younger person doesn‚Äôt work front line. 
*I get point is, apparently thinking know better experts right right dealing it.*

The point empirical data shows trusted experts simply working therefore propped public health model government.

The link supplied Netherlands National Institute Public Health. That's Dutch Dutch source gets. Nick Savanna one March ‚Äústay home, stay safe‚Äù. March well CDC starting recommending masks. scientist developed vaccines dont agree concept never heard mechanism vaccination virus would lead adaptation like that. reason border close earlier Mexico afraid political retorts protecting people.

And vital US-Mexico trade routes. Action slow covid almost always causes economic issues shutting parts border would cause lot economic disruption. may worth save lives long term lower cases mean faster recovery it‚Äôs decision made lightly. Honestly... appears communicable less severe **for majority.**

To people going start downvoting furiously: Engage brains read entire post.

I saying virus serious some. However ultra-majority according primary care doctor, easily survivable.

It people 65 older, pre-ex's, undiagnosed pre-ex's/untreated pre-ex's higher risk dying.

Yes, every often 18 year old gets severely ill virus data exceptions rule usually fit third category people preceding paragraph. Forget dystopian future, experience crushing brutality today! Politicians pandering base basis science. No, would never. Humans general, never lie. entire population atleast netherlands vaccinated weeks Surviving ICU one thing, living after-effects, another. lifetime toll COVID-19 taken survivors enormous. Lung damage, heart damage, kidney damage, even brain damage.   lied death low death rate attributing pneumonia. Schadenfreude baby.

White regimes January February: LOL look Wuhan bat eatin' CHINESE!

China now: HAHAHA white regimes thinks 5G causes COVID masks bad.

To China simple, better job show done.  Herd immunity 2nd try guess. Ok people downplaying virus wearing mask etc, think gonna go way use vaccine? Let alone pay it? century But... EVERYTHING political US! matter says, people looking reason ignore trying save lives. Yes that's variant facebook conspiracy theory. 100% false.

It possible influenza covid time. possible one cause false positive test. literally impossible given way virus tests work. \*Stares North Korea, Turkmenistan, Belarus\*

As in, one vector vaccines? forgot part allowed France either. also rushing actual testing. 6 month trial still gonna take 6 months. rushed production, making millions doses without knowing approval mainly ‚Äúrushing‚Äù happening Quick googling says NYC Italy $75k. assume one-way. 

From CO going I'd imagine insignificantly. American - good.

There exceptions. instance, private flights Hawaii non-peak times likely incur 2x price, pay plane fly back empty. believe sides border struggling. usually big weekend travel Mexico, I‚Äôm sure attempt try keep things getting worse due that. makes virus less dangerous. According cdc 0.4% people infected die. right number lower. perspective yearly flu 0.1% Spanish flu 10-20%. example covid cold gunshot lol.  might thinking countries America. almost need entire state get sick die people start taking seriously. yup, even major surgery fractured elbow border town family didn‚Äôt insurance, eight yrs old Long known cannabis bronchial dilator.

I can't recall last time saw someone without mask though, compliance seems pretty high (although I've gone grocery store). I'm worried 4th shatter one disagrees statement. Electing Trump President make things better fact numerous ways made things worse.

We need true progressive leader. Biden count deal 4 years choice chance beating Trump.

However 2024, actual progressive ala Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders come power.

Got called fear mongering. always, estimates way lower actual results. Expect 240000 dead November. Hey, that's great. find evidence protests led spikes? 

Many directly traced specific parties bars. Alcohol common thread here, leading people make bad decisions.

Every single study seen protesters cause evidence increase, likely mask usage, outdoors, keeping couple feet people.

Sorry fit angle trying take, truth. Hospitalization rate far less 1 5, yes, permanent damage long term complications. study UK estimated 10% long term permanent issues talking things even without virus. it, kind alarming haven't. Yeah. first hand experience idiots.

I note also posting history repeat virus falsehoods. 

I block people feel contribute negatively conversation. Bye! Oh finish. herd immunity levels.

I need tell anyone mean numbers... think estimate commitment working shown here. beyond I'd say Well, far know potatoes can‚Äôt get covid, alright. link support Ops claim extent masks even non-PPE reduce covid transmissions large margin. extracted studies conducted Italy NY peak infections town literally fine while. cases towners hospital closest one. guess what? nobody took seriously, started spreading. put different way, ran toilet paper flour. imagine would happened run masks? don‚Äôt doubt flu deaths lab confirmed, extent underestimated flu tests widely available doesn‚Äôt make sense. Congrats Also one thing spreading democratic authoritarianism: Democratic 'Free' States increasingly choosing withold downplay information order protect economy. Basically want trick people thinking safe go outside, purpose protecting economy. illnesses personal responsibility, according neoliberal responsibilization citizens. Everyone's health safety responsibility, therefore burden protection left citizens themselves, State left protect economy.

But apparently nothing wrong this, democractically elected people power. Legality stopped far, law show indication even trying catch up. USA broke record new 55000 infections today.

Let's also mention culture protests mask usage lockdowns, flooded beaches, early state reopenings (that close due new pikes), BLM riots protests, even presidential rallies. mass events. (BTW hope Covid parties really thing. )

I mean way Mexico masterfully controlling pandemic, really can. 50% positive test rate severe cases tested. developing country all. Healthy people can't tested unfortunately would waste resources strategy redirected. 

The majority people taking care themselves. ones stay home, stay home. ones option go work, go work. course idiots would say virus hoax insensitive people still go parties, reunions not, still, mask usage lockdown protests. Curfews business restrictions established. Covid Hospitals set up. Overall people responding better way sanitary norms. Simple that. 

So Americans want take 4th July weekend Puerto Pe√±asco struggling country, think struggling country right say ""Hold up. Y'all ready we"" way USA allowing non essential travel Mexicans first place. Explains lot! rate ship people keep numbers residents already infected. YES!

One interesting thing read studies protesting populations predisposed wearing face masks generally adhering infection safety measures (obviously excluding first place). Additionally, protests speculated effect creating de facto quarantine non-protesting populations since generally go drinks crowds protesters street.

I personally would like see studies indoor spread vs. outdoor spread crowds inform behaviors, unfortunately due recency events difficult find many studies. both? zombie Apocalypse would screwed. country would full zombie deniers people would street running toward zombies. several protests scheduled weekend well.

These Victorians, judge us they're morons. 

I mean even Tasmanians smarter this. Mostly theyve got second head though. can't believe like 5 weeks school. ain't way we're ready schools open. Thats actually one secondary reasons ""Stay home"" guidance. engage less risky activities, less types incidents. Really ? thought OK people gathering one place ? rate transmission falling legal lockdowns employers people already voluntarily locking prior government orders.

If think spread would declined everyone acted like nothing happening, that‚Äôs delusional. study Patel colleagues found, perhaps anticlimactically, corticosteroid usage significantly increase decrease risk hospitalization among asthmatics Covid-19.¬†  think biggest thing data provide reassurance \[to patients\] staying inhaled corticosteroids appear increase risk severe Covid-19,‚Äù Patel said.¬†

Seems like important point No, going manufacture 7 billion 17 lol. promising one(s) start manufactured. way 1 billion per year manufacturing capacity vaccines. sounds wrong. Must total coincidence combining serology tests brought Orange County‚Äôa test positivity 12% 7.95%, right state‚Äôs set goal 8% Sadly south always shithole filled terrible humans. Church‚Äôs always people woken last decades. Bullshit. ignoring social distancing, wearing masks, opening soon. Focusing low death rate several times many crippled virus stupid. Yup, wait hits place like Villages.   TIL vanilla ice white Thanks. understand:

Viral Test = PCR Test = measures RNA (active)

Antibody Test = Serological Test = measures antibodies (inactive)

So next question - combined datasets? media outlets report ""cases rising"", mean ""viral test cases rising""? 

Also, make sure understand, others seem suggest Orange County deflating case load. 30K antibody tests included, antibody test positivity percentage 30K test? Let's say 15-20% - actually decrease overall test positivity percentage? agree first two points; however, think Fauci complicit much afraid saying anything would get removed position replaced trump appointee would issues caving every demand. 

If watch task force updates interviews shows/networks, tell Fauci careful deliberate wording phrasing. remember person, regardless experience expertise, susceptible dismissed current administration lack loyalty. Anything contradicts president makes hin look bad way door next day. 

Fauci pretty decent track record regards major health crises tenure director NIAID. takes job seriously think otherwise believe sorely mistaken. Also, even encouraged citizens wear masks, majority (mostly people continue wear first place) would declare ""rights bein' infringed upon!""

As statistician that, say, ""quit"", actually fired refused manipulatethe data would allow Florida begin reopening. say believe agree Federal government's response continues abysmal, think Fauci entirely (if all) fault here. Masks saved us alone. need mass medical grade masking really shut down. Yes ad hoc approach slow down, always going take shut down, testing, social distancing, compelling DPA PPE/ventilators, complex industry/public cooperation. going take statesmanship ensure money provided PPP abused.

It's highly complex problem one man simpleton. One man however power let experts execute fullest. One man chose to.  India also posted record ""smashing"" previous recoveries, close 19000+ recoveries day.

Let's talk sides negative. Happiness health all. is. projections graph Worldometer uses fairly spot on. added universal mask protection it. insane low deaths go wear mask. Stay up, player. ok. soon we‚Äôd like. probably somewhat related, evidence virus spreads much better indoors air circulation outside full sun. protesters mostly pro-mask side spectrum. Yes, everyone wearing mask; yes, masks block virus completely. still much better scenario jam-packing bars restaurants. ... from.

I need know region/country report scientist regarding potentially contaminated water cause stupidity. TX It‚Äôs almost New York epicenter... keep energy 2 months hospitals eventually hit max capacity deaths begin skyrocket. People commenting luxury never make hard decision people love most, hold hands take last breath. 

Fuck trolls. Ouch, burn! act like shit high morality rate though, get tf BS. went O'Reilly's today get windshield wiper blades. Two employees, masks covering noses, six people store, none masks. 

I'm sure county in, people county ridiculously upset new mask order. incredibly childish. Riots ? Facebook got adds? never see use ad blocker Mine starts exactly one month. Many others also start around too. Okay, that's ignorance say zero evidence behaves differently. I'm done. Good luck. Imagine US politicians realize they're losing tax payers. Upvote cuz Raiders happen regular rhinovirus. want lockdown cold too? Good time ask check... MMA safest sport run right now.  requires fewest amount people arena time pull off.  

Sure, there's two guys fighting time, but, COVID probably safer brain damage they're giving other.

We‚Äôre. Not. Testing. Enough. Kids.

Seriously, assumptions recommendations schools made assumptions based inadequate testing. sites FL won‚Äôt even test younger kids. 

Think it. You‚Äôre parent. kid seems fine. You‚Äôre gonna drag testing site someone shove swab nose, see? Probably not. assume people not.

Unless start testing MASSIVE scale, making assumptions kids ability spread seems reckless. 

I get it. I‚Äôm parent. want kids socialize get education. wife could really use relief. wishes don‚Äôt change reality.

I know candidate better, I'm sure red flags. I'd go Biden American USA! USA! like people protested shits giggles. people carrying signs saying ""STOP KILLING US"", that's problem postpone. neither. equally deadly, though.

In Germany, situation - Prof. Wiehler first said masks unnecessary later changed mind.

The difference US Merkel (also scientist btw) insist wrong claim, changed regulations accordingly.

It's ability deal one's mistakes makes real difference. That's Trump consistently fucks up. Many faults ?? 

Like locked earliest idiots still go attend weddings govts fault. Ok. last round analysis could fine. Deaths underreported states earlier hit (the North eastern ones), everywhere else pretty point reported deaths.

That aside, might take time cases translate death.. We'll really see things look 4 weeks...

Optimistically deaths change means we're measuring lot asymptomatic cases. likely psychosomatic. people conflate truth accuracy scaremongering, fact nothing one another. People react number ways information. Fear choice, one caused facts. Completely healthy, fat, top form young people risk groups, yet devastated disease. be, say, volume cases seeing, ""few"" going reach large numbers. notice continue jobs spreaders test. sound pretty good someone drunk, think well!!.... drunk redditing going turn drunk dials? Hopefully trip lifetime. Honestly idiot mask matter fact, actually grants freedom. think Hong Kong protesters wear them? America see thing big ! First season over, already ordered 2 ! Still angry dimwits continuously told coronavirus dangerous weeks ago Covid 19 exposed American stupidity almost bad Trump presidency humiliating Ya, keep seeing recycled articles also us know ones. There's really one contagious keeps popping up. We've known since March. terrible. woman CFS [gave TED years back experience this.  imperialists understand lying, comrade? CDC full shit. NYC .3% population die corona we're saying CFR .4%? Hmmmmmmm almost case severe possible without death. almost dying would easier less painful deal this.

Jesus christ.... Broadway actor, losing leg full lung transplant survive something many people either easily overcome easily succumb to.

It's wild.. loved one. point almost would numb new news going wrong done fix it. need worry them, privileged people receive plasma treatment time. Stay worthless state, pls. Colorado want you. number confirmed cases really mean anything. estimates [20 million likely infected anyway.

And side note, put death rate approximately half percentage point? ... read millions Americans one paycheck away poverty ‚Äùclose 40% don‚Äôt money put aside emergency‚Äú. course do.    
It's called Maskbook it.. ? like 600k tests day rising. break 100k day 15% positive. many comrades protecting motherland sub.

If want upvotes say something negative imperialist USA 'dog america' Australia! simple. Nice Yes, areas around cities like Miami Orlando span miles miles. There's hardly anywhere *something* hardly nature anywhere, save everglades. miles miles *stuff.* argue ""well yeah, that's around cities"" that's normal states. level least. New Jersey think biggest exception, FL super dense. 

NY FL one rank terms population density, that's NYC alone. NYC adds massive amount population, NY pretty big state, density ranks pretty high. remove NYC equation, state would pretty low density. perhaps NYC alone higher density FL city, FL state, pretty fucking dense. Hmm, sounds like pillory reminds mugshot policies US.

Shaming fine, imo done live afterwards national level. inverse.. individual hospital systems handle since spread out.. governor waaaaay head.  Idk people getting angry this. correct title misleading, people dont understand says may factually correct number contents post, doesnt explain anything generalized genuinely misinforms. great casinos reopened Oh no. solve permanent organ damage masks seatbelts?  Unions looking workers, see. Thats... little harsh. live work here. 

Like yeah issues purpose. Rookie numbers. Sweden significantly lower death rate countries implemented strict policies Spain, France, England, Italy.

And developed herd immunity point COVID-19 longer anything rounding error total death tolls. 

Isn't goal? Maybe Mexico end paying wall all... one else? two? lol.. tell kill handful people everyday?

I gotta say, first.. understand even possible. Wow Trump really it! made us #1 again! really hope right.  Either way, based sky rocketing infection rate, scientists certainly sufficient sample size study follow years. Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahaha sure understand separation church state is. I‚Äôm worried month now. Cases spiking deaths seem follow month Study: sky blue.  Probably (no data available yet) we'll see. carry around drink everywhere go point ""don't wear eating drinking"" RemindMe! 2 years [as July 2020, US significantly underreporting deaths, particularly Texas &amp; Florida?]  sat front porch watched neighbours around light fireworks.

Don‚Äôt need go out. Grabbed crappy Calgary beer put Canadian tunes Bluetooth.

Hell, might every year on. Medical machinery pretty complex, it‚Äôs trivial throw clinically useful rtPCR machine together. We‚Äôve waiting another one four months, we‚Äôre running four ground. Service wait times ridiculous.

Although there‚Äôs bright side, CST state running two gene Xperts machines, helps out.

If anybody knows run rtPCR stuff find garage, let CDC know get EUA. work research facility. Masks required campus (which tiny percentage staff; us WFH indefinitely) since mid March. awkward grace period weeks struggled get company-provided masks everyone, pretty uniform.

There's zero controversy. mask discussion centered around optimal masks, optimal filters, best masks all-day wear, best design fogging glasses, sort thing. Whether wear never even question. we're scientists. airborne virus. Masks common sense. 

It blows mind case *medical school*. Holy fuck. know science education background they're missing need remedy continuing anything. I'm talking higher ups, students. kind education students must receiving certainly thrown question decision. government. Donald Trump GOP. They'll care hits red states much chances election diminish. Nothing wrong going out, responsibly mask distancing.  Might well. Free Dr. Fauci actually spread virus updates without interference. I'm sure spread diseases viruses easily too. links image dead unfortunately, go. sure, China could‚Äôve should‚Äôve nipped bud December instead punishing whistleblowers Living Sedgwick County seeing many people without masks, excited Friday could feel way safer public. Guess that's happening anymore Yeah, completely agree - gran 92 passed still living productive life! People tend dismissive older someone else gets imo. don‚Äôt give fuck. going happen eventually anyway. long hospitals handle it, indication can‚Äôt, better everyone (maximally non-vulnerable) get maximum hospital throughput, since herd immunity way this. someone clarify deaths? backlog go way back up? like 200 deaths daily week last? It‚Äôs aren‚Äôt allowed per se. doesn‚Äôt apply unless claim fear testifying lead criminal charges. ""reopening"", could thriving economy!

But no, Abbott party hates market are. hear Victorias 66 new cases today, feel bad god could waves feminism, it? Anyway obtain using equation instead excel? tried using Geometric Progression gotten another number instead. Sad record usually broken next day see commercials taught toddler build wall? tripping vote him. Happy cake day That's unproven conspiracy theory last knew. Feel free link proof, evidence, statements coroners suggesting ""25%"" hidden.

Yeah lot crazy conspiracy theories come Yale days. know medrxiv keeps publishing them. March April could get test. Remember? Even every symptom, turned away enough tests. enough tests.

That 1/10 figure obviously accurate now. 

Also, source says antibody tests inaccurate half time. 

If going present facts, make sure actually factual. moot one wears damn thing many deaths? someone mail guinness world record plaque trump directly? Oh wait. doesn‚Äôt accept responsibility anything ever does. Leadership skills, right? Well there's least 130,000 family friend circles despairing lately due close covid deaths. might want run numbers... even 100k cases day, it'll still take 165M / 100k = 1,650 days 4.5 years get 50% population, absolutely bare minimum herd immunity, even exist. think purpose falls ""still EU stuff end 2020"" bucket. US people would restricted entering UK. Could close roads ground planes like ‚Äúwell guess could walk‚Äù . sort order insists private plane companies certain flights? roads ‚Äúunder maintenance‚Äù. lot borders rivers makes even easier, whoops bridges unsafe except pedestrian one go get rowboat took words mouth, it‚Äôs sad see believed state go like pieces shits like . something soon won‚Äôt able anything later. Idk source Worldometer US 683 deaths.  Sigh..... Get ready 100k/day soon boiissss family got together weekend Airbnb, wearing masks 24/7. It‚Äôs super annoying that‚Äôs way spend time see other. 

Ugh Florida new infections dropping quickly, governor started re-openings, many restaurants bars jammed pack people , yes shut down, damage done, churches mega churches, packed, many without masks,  beaches opened, packed people. many without masks,  surprise weeks exponential growth, doubling daily cases every 7 days?  today 10,000 day level, keep rising till hit cap many test done day. hell even opened theme parks. Washington added till end August today. certain states. Novak Ddjokovic's tournament WWE, business think sports safe? company increased hours operation roughly 3 hrs per day.

Yeah.  Florida.

Yay. collective effort articles like promotes going out. Yup impossible find place test at. Im waiting results Labcorp company ship you, extremely fast. know accurate they'll be, exposure symptoms we'll see. Ah, malicious morons Thanks.

So Transcription Mediated Amplification - total amateur bio person here, reading description headache inducing lol. So, one TMA tests would essentially test popping N95 mask? 

Can provide brief r/explainlikeimfive? Lol Source? Yet NJ opened casinos SARS spread way took Hong Kong back. 

A big cluster victims got sharticles spread plumbing fumes one person entered A/C vents aparment rooms. driving 1998 Pathfinder. Thing tape deck Dolby surround. Still sounded nice. Thank protestors. Trying save lives cops okay killing virus. That's special kind stupid. Hahaha Susan Collins Well it‚Äôs shame China corrupted allows companies sell masks poor quality.

As see it, greatly contributing global death count.

In Sweden performed test mask bought China, turned crap. üòÇ see woman made bikini surgical mask, god awful photo shoot outside store tried go like that? She'll put aware face. 

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

Dr. Anthony Fauci, Mar 2020

I agree last point, important honest start. top doctor CDC walking back statements, gives justification people continue believing government lies get them... microchips, vaccines, 5g towers, masks....etc

Regardless intent, look much backfiring. 

Look asian countries see simple yet effective wearing masks are. 

So much could avoided. look dragging feet sand. 

Just switch masks guns. Could imagine faced domestic military threat equal covid-19? bet ass, trump co would make sure enough guns made police/military even every single American wanted buy gun day. Pistols citizens, semi-auto soldiers. 


To honest, feel like desensitized shit, set bar lower think. president snited states influenced nations top doctor global pandemic. fuck. Every time choke water know intelligent design. would love see something cloth mask data conclusions coming UPenn, TJU, Boston General, NY Pres, Harvard - echoed NEJM - said rigorous testing manners construction ad hoc masks counted reduce spread coughs sneezes. None close medical grade efficacy.

I really worried conclusions thought ""never maskers"" would go nuts. 

If P100 let rip. I'm sure I'd feel differently wearing cloth face covering lived outside Northeast US Individualists respect, even though me. true individualists try independent self sustaining, they're type live remotely grow much food. days want benefits society none obligations, that's selfishness. China 10M pool testing Wuhan within 10 days. great Florida 20 millions population something like this. redneck riviera moment. confirm. stupid motherfuckers visiting acting like literally another day beach. ZERO PRECAUTION. mean ZERO. masks, distancing. Mask use might 15% mostly locals. Bars restaurants packed frequently closing workers turn positive. get looked stupid wearing n95s. Love fuck morons, we're out. ABSOLUTELY hotbed 2-4 weeks. idiots take back home too. feel bad locals many conversations them. They're obviously concerned tourism time year they've got. healthcare horrible God help them. give internal UV lights, body, kill virus. Light lungs, around! Battery packs all! #winning would think lung transplant rare corona infections young adults. People need lung transplants diseases time. Unless large proportion young adults start need lung transplants worried permanent effects COVID. Lone Ranger's mask covers eyes... Ultimately, yes. Monetarily no. move next month day care nobody watch son becomes, much squeeze nonexistent government would say it‚Äôs almost good looking trend compare Sweden neighbors see death rate much higher. course, unlike Americans Red country, Swedes actually seem following social distancing guidelines. Insert bugs bunny meme wearing hat putting hands silly accept least trying spread awareness especially considering people use social media holy fuck American, I‚Äôd like gold star total lockdown table. it‚Äôs nuclear weapon much collateral damage. 

i agree father Texan here. correct. Oh Karen condition alright Hand Desantis fiddle. Rome burning. wife tested(negative)last week Texas. free sites days took multiple days calling get spot. website free testing seemed overloaded wouldn‚Äôt function multiple days. week symptoms get test. urgent cares maxed little testing size. avg sized one seeing 40 patients day. Good luck basically every place could think call. results came back 5 days later. There‚Äôs serious wait time get answers. I‚Äôm angry least. 

Just laying facts. 

I could care less people stay home. 

They 40-50 years. Won‚Äôt bother none. Look difference pneumonia flu cases 2020 compared 2000-2019 average. 2-3 times greater. COVID deaths aren‚Äôt reported. Well... government start race riot.. people huddled together closer beach on. People gullable shit government knows it. People robots rely social connections coworkers. Young children pets easy way - one reasons companies ""bring child work day"". 

Hopefully lawyers wrote agreement wont enforced sort attitude working home work well either employees business itself. many posts very... Uh... call it? News, fact, number check?

Anyways, final tally is: 57,236 Yet hospitals still overloaded deaths ticked much.  kind work do? morbid :-) actually totally get mean this... right. Cops actually allowed quite bit. masters loop hole. due mastery, use excuses exempt things truly held accountable over. 

I speeding cop related. shot killed unarmed man, felt life danger. search car without warrant think smell weed. give K9 hand signal makes act like smells drugs. gives right. Etc etc. masters loop hole. 

This Christopher Dorner hit news story manifesto, fired due crooked cops backing crooked cop genuine cop saw senseless brutality reported it. clicked made sense me.

 burned alive inside cabin, made sense me. interest taking alive. ways wanted bring justice corrupt officers. wanted justice cop killer.. 

It known proven firing tear gas enclosed space likely leads fires. start purpose. knowingly fired tear gas inside banking fire starting knowing Dorner would choose honor surrender.

I like pretend Dorner pulled 007 made secret tunnel hahaha. apparently Yeah masks sure help ton. roommate pass wore masks. also went insane amount hand sanitizer. everyone tried actually catch spread it, would able really slow shit No, fly. seen corona virus cause clotting, attack brain, kidneys, liver, blood circulation, heart, etc. behaved like old coronavirus, think safe say would conversation hospitals overwhelmed country disarray. Please explain. voted. Progressive America jealous public health long time. shitty two-party electoral college nonsense exist literally nothing anyone outside 1%. sad part would trust politicians today amend 1st amendment anyway. Mountains evidence? I'm there, think plus reopening MUCH quickly &amp; widely. weren‚Äôt announced Disney come terms equity yet. Many groups, VOL included called back work reblocking reimagining shows safer COVID world. Perhaps VOL could move stage across pavilion sing mic‚Äôed instead. Regardless, doesn‚Äôt seem much chance happening given current discussions. 

Blues Brothers, Frog Choir, performances happening safety precautions place Universal. comes willing sacrifice part ‚Äúthe show‚Äù ‚Äúthe look‚Äù safety performers Disney. certainly hope Disney come terms that. Trump says keeping people getting back work. security team Corona holiday back soon working. everyone else stepping making stock market great again? sucks many people exposed ot symptoms impossible get test. resort ordering one online would fair. far every taxation economic stimulus scheme I‚Äôve seen disproportionately benefited people children though. Ahhh..you ABC News screen.  
I real pissed old articles high daily news. Click bait whores. yeah..stupid keeps clicking away. 
I Canada. like downthere ? It‚Äôs hilarious movie I‚Äôve ever seen day.m, 31 year old man. wasn‚Äôt even ahead time. entire film epitomizes 21st century America. Yeah whole coronavirus response uniformly awful US. That's get got here. Well, it‚Äôs coming. I‚Äôve thinking I‚Äôm gonna handle this. FIL living us terminal liver cancer. definitely don‚Äôt want add Covid problems.

I try careful. Always use mask. Stay away people. day older woman handed phone talk husband. pulled mask could hear me. I‚Äôm afraid might stupid get becomes widespread state. Right it‚Äôs almost nothing live don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna last. church people seem think Jesus protect them. probably would given smarter brains concerned them. sure srs... makes sad. ER workers know job get taxing whole new level fair them. Hope fucking haircuts worth yes? Borat right. ignorant apparently. appreciate posts #Stupidnado Michigan teacher here. teach 1st grade. K-5 kids don‚Äôt wear masks fall, do. Masks prevent spread. basically, can‚Äôt get wired kid dies well ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt come staff!‚Äù. They‚Äôre literally asking us sacrifice parents go back work. least, that‚Äôs majority us feel. 

Unpopular opinion, know. teachers us brainwashed since day one mindset self-sacrifice good students needs end. now, won‚Äôt happen. always door mates expected take crap pay, paying school supplies don‚Äôt/complain, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dedicated enough‚Äù.

To parents pissed homeschooling: going teachers start dying, others protest/quit? aren‚Äôt enough us go around is!

End rant. Ugh. heard argument many damn times (German here). Like, kidding, everything pretty okay guess what, acted time.

But still whine wear mask shopping currently cause numbers bad. research. Long history bad vaccines causing narcolepsy diseases. NY testing people got hospitalized due initial shortages tests, though?

Plus...Ducey's done much, people overall done much, pretty much *everyone* knows it'll get worse. couple places, we're nearly 1 4. hear 1 3?! Anyone? Florida? Texas? problem covid 19 RO estimated around 5-8 range. vaccine 50% effectiveness would cut half, means would still spread even everyone took vaccine.

and another problem, 30% population take vaccine, number may higher know vaccine 50% effective, common reason given taking flu shot. Havasu? ages, I'm guessing shit hole based county in. coming make comment How'd work her? come people Naples wearing masks... That‚Äôs virus though much deadlier months back. 

I wore respirator way Asia end February, that‚Äôs thought 5% chance dying got it. answer one respectable source? sucks, sorry dude.

When visit next, start putting tags things garage sale. poor guy's story still freaks out. know would emotional strength go family have/are. also wonder hell they're affording this. broke sick. Maybe both. Thems yer choices. Elections also make sure people don‚Äôt become governor. Yeah. sure define mild started gripping headache unlike anything ever experienced. Felt faint , weak, sweaty. Collapsed chemists taken hospital.

Had CT scan, spinal tap. Covid really considered cough.

Headache respond anything, morphine, beta blockers. Eyes turned yellow bloodshot. 

Spent 2 weeks bed, developed GI Symptoms.

Got better felt weak another 5-7 weeks. bed ridden. Even microwaving oats would ruin, stand long enough shower lost lot weight muscle build wall. probably work too. Trump virus best ever. Yeah live Houston, don‚Äôt really love here, like literally anything could possibly need available abundant open pretty late. moved ‚Äúbig‚Äù city northeast would say Houston way available time. like anyyyything could need. least inside loop idk ur like talking tomball something lol. places DFW still aren‚Äôt bad compared metro size. hide rest life virus, don‚Äôt think wants go twice. 4% world's population, 25% new covid cases (coincidentally, 25% world's prison population too).

Texas palate expects whole lime haha isn‚Äôt way am. working teaching certificate, vast majority retired teachers. Okay, that's likely true situations, we're dealing novel, mutating virus, *need* know things may true ASAP kinda need save asses luxury waiting several years till studies gone repeated successful peer reviews. Nope, can‚Äôt indestructible permanent organ damage.. 48% 45% reduced risk death. don‚Äôt include many nasty side effects possible category dead yet. calculation permanent damage rules indestructible. Without even discuss can‚Äôt add numbers... ;) are, lot positive tests... sad is.  Seatbelts also protect others car getting hit go flying Yea theyll probably happen spring get vaccine Anyone brain access calculator tell it‚Äôs way deadlier flu. India makes 70% world's vaccines. NASCAR seems working well. easy testing area? heard many descriptions early symptoms probably best go it. got mate

http://archive.is/jKgnz bad think Florida could much better.   rookie numbers! think people starting understand Borat brilliant movie was. Americans peculiar. husband Mayo Clinic last week bc several diseases needed check-in updated medical care. They‚Äôve got down. one person go you, REQUIRED wear mask, sit opposite side dr speaking, medical staff masks PLUS plastic eyewear, everything marked off, chairs removed distanced, tape floor elevator (only 6 people per elevator), temps taken questions asked every entrance, wear sticker day saying you‚Äôve checked, cleaners constantly clean. 

When returned home weeklong appts returned normal life running quick errand, eye opening. one following order capacity masks. stepped different world one incredibly cautious. Says lot want go place sick people are.  Texan here. dont agree strategy here, basically this: ""let businesses people decide want handle this, gets really bad, I'll step in.""

And 100% agree that, makes sense freedom people perspective. Problem idiots. 18 weeks literal life-&amp;-death triage hospitals. CDC‚Äôs CFR 0.4% That's actually stereotype [that I‚Äôm wondering second-wave anti-lockdown/mask protests seen months, especially Michigan. get main problem since closed guess. really, small, outdoor wedding someplace like distance seems fairly innocent grand scheme things. ever heard elon musk crazy. talk economists they'll tell key fixing economy requires virus addressed.

Fat Man waited get help 3 hours away death Get ready ~~100k~~ absurdly high number cases / day

PS 100k Fauci's gloomy projection btw Time Ho Spice really want know we‚Äôre basing ‚Äúthey may spread less‚Äù idea on. testing lots asymptomatic kids? doubt it. Adults spread pre asymptomatically, wouldn‚Äôt kids? 

Absence evidence isn‚Äôt evidence absence. Good job, Ireland! :D You‚Äôll find month chart here: 


When flu season United States?

In United States, flu season occurs fall winter. influenza viruses circulate year-round, time flu activity peaks December February, activity last late May. research check r/enough_musk_spam examples.

""This great news""

Honestly, doubt leaders would get away that. India billion half people. 18000 deaths much, right agenda. Conversely: studies claim 100% certainty studying virus less six months definitely worth paper they're written on. Get ready ~~100k~~ absurdly high number cases / day

PS 100k Fauci's gloomy projection btw We‚Äôre going find high limit goes .053 damn near zero..

It's clear decided evolve understanding. biggest BLM protests month ago now. Even ignoring time looking locations, New York's numbers still going plenty protests there.

Keep mind that, despite attention protests got media, participants add small percent population. Factor fact virus spreads less effectively outdoors, there's much case blaming current spikes--even part--on BLM protests. looks like there's bit many idiots running there: really trust test data? think fuckery afoot. sheer massive scale testing lab work needed really makes suspicious accurate reporting. I‚Äôm saying COVID isn‚Äôt real shouldn‚Äôt taken seriously. I‚Äôm even saying positive rate isn‚Äôt increasing. I‚Äôm questioning rate anywhere near correct. Holy shit that's good info.

Oh poor man :(   Dallas County wanted take action earlier, Greg Abbott stopped every case fault. PCR/antibody testing =/= symptom screening True, America never going ""win"" coronavirus. ""Trump bad, hurr durr durr"" America's political system allow fast complete enough response kind pandemic. American political governmental system cumbersome, inefficient, all, slow act. design, course. great protecting totalitarianism, terrible protecting disease rapidly evolving domestic threats.

Further, health decisions made primarily state level, responses board depending state government, unlike countries, states can't really close borders, neighboring state something stupid, get screwed. (For example New York / New Jersey). 

Add poor quality America's healthcare system, everything that's happened COVID-19 exactly would expect. surprises, except people understand America works, including Americans understand country. doesn‚Äôt be. order says law enforcement ‚Äúcan should‚Äù enforce, ‚Äúshall‚Äù enforce. statutory interpretation, former language permissive latter mandatory. basically same:

10 tests per 1,000 people == 1% testing rate.

However, testing rate lower, 0.2 tests per thousand, clearer writing ""0.02%"" (2 percent percent), people would interpret simply ""2 percent"". dad takes piss people wearing masks. Ugh. Yup! Totally agree points. emphasis masks protecting others ludicrous start (see study reported today).

FTFY  Covid first time.

*Spanish flu entered chat.* end get them? keep coming back matter hard try continue flare ups. Locking entire cities ever week isn‚Äôt long term solution disease spread. Especially one huge amount asymptomatic mildly symptomatic carriers.

The way live virus, going eradication give temporary illusion safety asymptomatic carrier shows up, point you‚Äôre blind thought beat it. yelling things like ""We want go home!""

Backstory:

After initial outbreak, state-wide curfew put place, student dorms forced close throw inhabitants (some fear potential risk return families, tried finding shelter hotels, friends, colleagues, etc).

The idea behind case major outbreak, student dorms area would used make-shift quarantine zone (this includes inhabited rooms, forcefully emptied people's belongings, unable take within 72h period (these items apparently ""stored marked trash bags put away lockers"" - checked fact)). reality pantry cabinet downstairs tons canned goods boxed food. two fridge/freezer combos filled food. canned goods boxed goods upstairs tons paper products cleaning products medicine stocked. 

So reality could easily go 6 weeks without store trip would end covid all. everyone else would also assumption. article talking Georgia actually ‚Äúsheltered place‚Äù weeks governor actually required white collar jobs restaurants shut down. 

I‚Äôd imagine number people didn‚Äôt initially feel comfortable state reopened. However, states like Georgia didn‚Äôt instantly start spiking, started visiting family taking risks father severely disabled stroke decade ago. He's 57 years old much he's disabled, still capable. He's paralyzed one side, stop walking help walker. can't speak clearly due aphasia, usually understand inflection &amp; playing 20 questions. best describe like he's almost like toddler, better emotional intelligence. still use computer figure stuff &amp; lot himself. laundry dishes &amp; dress example.

But he's still limited 8 yrs caring ourselves, make difficult choice put assisted living facility. 

Stories like scare death. dad could get sick someone even bother helping look see disability &amp; fully understand situation still much life &amp; joy inside him.

He's happiest person know. He's always got smile face tells strangers, ""I love you"" (cause that's one phrases say own).

I've sick death every damn day since started. live across country, makes difficult.

We entrust others right family members put facilities. hope situations lives taken care &amp; consideration doctors nurses would loved ones 

I know tough decisions made right now, really implore everyone understand life &amp; story behind every single one people country decided worth sacrificing.

I seen father since last November know I'll get see again.

The thought he's made far life everything could die hands wreckless careless people breaks heart.

The Wall Street Journal talked nearly 90 front-line doctors, nurses, health-care workers, hospital administrators government officials, reviewed emails, legal documents memos, analyze went wrong. Among missteps identify:

‚Ä¢ Improper patient transfers. patients sick transferred hospitals. Squabbling Cuomo de Blasio administrations contributed uncoordinated effort.

‚Ä¢ Insufficient isolation protocols. Hospitals often mixed infected patients uninfected early on, virus spread non-Covid-19 units.

‚Ä¢ Inadequate staff planning. Hospitals added hundreds intensive-care beds always enough trained staff, leading improper treatments overlooked patients dying alone.

‚Ä¢ Mixed messages. State, city government hospital officials kept shifting guidelines exposed ill front-line workers return work.

‚Ä¢ Overreliance government sources key equipment. Hospitals turned state federal government hundreds ventilators, many faulty inadequate.

‚Ä¢ Procurement-planning gaps. leaders focused attention procuring ventilators, hospitals didn‚Äôt always provide adequate supplies critical resources including oxygen, vital-signs monitors dialysis machines.

‚Ä¢ Incomplete staff-protection policies. Many hospitals provided staff insufficient protective equipment testing

They also include bunch brutal quotes nurses doctors patients died removing oxygen masks stuff. made hospitals sound like Normandy beach something.

(not american) Well, still think wishing disease upon someone isn‚Äôt best thing Yes pretty easy get note doctor abeutt/anxiety put mask. forget sunscreen world getting rekt covid19. ones getting rekt basically everyone except Oceania East + SE Asia. vouch this. 50% positive rate testing hospital admissions nobody else. Many people clearly covid dischargeable tested. yet Disneyworld opening days, bring whole family, kids friends y'all!

Right heart exploding covid hot zone!  don‚Äôt say, please work free. First they‚Äôll say can‚Äôt pay time week, funds account next Thursday, pinkie swear! weeks go paychecks get later later. maybe get partial paychecks shiny IOU attached. 

You‚Äôre frog you‚Äôre boiling slowly. quit? owe month back pay. That‚Äôs lot money! quit **never** pay owe - they‚Äôll pay active employees first.

So long painful process healthcare workers pull plug? guess we‚Äôll find soon! Ok, read imagine Vegas hotel bed.

Covid thing I'm worried about. disgusting. almost 6 months since outbreak cases back February...?

Wow, he's right top - folks? sea angry day friends. Everyone‚Äôs gotta get peak. Thats works. acting like it‚Äôs inevitable virus goes area pandemic. You‚Äôre still better NJ hit 400 deaths per day 8000 people hospitalized.

The goal flatten curve, slow inevitable. world never eradicating this, it‚Äôs either let pass let pass later. 

Especially since sub also two years vaccine train now, get sooner rather later. Figures. least character head like Mickey Mouse better protected regular grunts work food service like.  Lol what? I'm conspiracy theorist Trump voter give fuck. ""hoax"" ridiculous. Texas rapidly rising. 3 test sites assist Harris County positivity rate 23% last week, 25% last 3 days. Jesus Christ exciting adventure, glad hear everyone survived. Rest world shit last three months... actually stupid pretending be? really read first wife treated whipped ton vitro babies. Basically dumped ton children go live new life. Westminster made decision represents four nations within union, England. Holyrood (devolved Scottish government) example make decision far I'm aware.

It'd similar federal government halting flights UK article saying 'texas bans flights UK US"" Tax payers pay bribes.

(That hurt type) Thailand stage Vietnam right now. Agreed 100% We've excellent result! 

We've kiwis returning NZ it, there's compulsory 14-day supervised quarantine that's captured risk. 

The problem couple kiwis came back home UK dying Mum (not COVID). applied compassionate leave exit quarantine early visit her, granted it.

Turns positive, great angst given travelled half country get home. 

It mistake nothing bad seems come processes since changed. cases still isolation, we're restriction-free. :) wait autumn cold wet weather roll in, that's going fun. I'm cautiously optimistic rollout late September/early October goes well. Even ChAdOx fail (unlikely imo), Pfizer says they're track October CoronaVac Sino Pharm looks good too. Chinese govt. developed vaccine given military, make will.

Us regular guys able get then, we'll able protect secure frontline medical workers (who really risen occasion) infection. at-risk groups taken care of, we'll able get vaccine hopefully end shit all.

Stay strong, dude. also testing employees. all. guys took family vacation global pandemic that‚Äôs killing thousands every day? wise ask judge.. dare criticize China sub??!! Empathy wonderful thing! baffles Fuscos, virus‚Äôs path showed little logic. infected relative heavy smoker showed symptoms, two older uncles myriad underlying health problems rebounded week. Several sickest family members serious underlying health problems, Mr. Fusco said. 

The way affects people differently. I'm curious researchers going find. Well Memorial Day likely contributed spread - 4th big problem folk gonna party outside (see protests) issue family get-togethers people house hanging people renting hotel rooms partying clubs bars later evening. That's issue. 9-9-9? else could made thing?

plus delivered alot pizza  Maybe everyone notice. example, [Asymptomatic People Still Develop Lung Unless everyone contracts COVID gets CT scan, extent harm COVID remain unknown. virus new nobody knows long term effects be. Well!... *bankers* say so! 

/s Think way....

There‚Äôs probably higher chance they‚Äôll hurt school playground receive serious side effects COVID. reference, Ireland counts deaths Covid-deaths based suspicion alone without requirement confirmed positive test result. would hope recent increase- people would sense. not, increase probably write school year. Netherlands thorough case tracking? That'd last guess.

I hope gets masses soon. People counting covid deaths, whats ignored totally number deaths occurring due conditions well lack ICUs hospitals over. mean, wrong. rich people pay fine.

Fuck that. want extraordinary measures brain dead minute before. lol Everyone? don‚Äôt one. don‚Äôt want one. know get nigh 100% symptoms complications, still pass on?
That‚Äôs big concern think personally... Unmitigated States Disaster It‚Äôs appalling Americans care natives land seem passionate affairs countries. Oh, Texan. voting one get (though they'd better position require it, also forced places provide masks). church one totally get. backwards unfortunate. :( Goldmam Know Everything Sachs U.S.A! U.S.A!

No, that's put bodies. isn‚Äôt source months back friend sent old BBC film 50s talking people cold flu remedies. sent cause funny, lots covering vinegar wrapping brown paper, people wrapped old soaks around neck. 

But one thing common get bed days sleep off.

After this; I‚Äôm going take different approach illness, take easy give body chance it‚Äôs job. I'm sorry hear this. father died Covid. can't imagine losing parents; single loss completely turned lives upside forever. 

It stings even worse see country allowed virus continue spread, masses think political. Just... fuck all. 

Stay strong. I'm giving best shot well. Easier said done. many close minded ppl San Antonio even rural Texas... ""freedom"".... Second, cases found predominately younger people, higher chance surviving virus. fact. make what's happening acceptable, like majority people testing positive hospitalized 65+ year olds like back March.

For now. likely change time. unrealistic expect young infected infect older people. infect older people. USA dying Empire. Rot within.

Literally guns rights health. 

Just mind blowing levels relentless capitalism hell China still get pass!?

They claim tested 90 million people yet Qatar, population 3 million, cases! hell one questioning this? think places got control, early phase? Oh, bad. totally missed still talking gym. Fuck that. bought treadmill stimulus check. There's way I'd set foot fucking gym. That's madness.

Calling get test impossible phone lines busy. Even general doctor picking phone. Finally got teledoc appointment yesterday approving test gotten call back yet get it. drove testing site open everyone morning got around hour. Probably get results. Tried follow general doctor complications kept ringing without picking up.

Florida fucked. Remember guys, it, like flu, affects people vulnerable. need get alarmed. Think poor restaurant employees wearing mask protect patrons church people wearing mask. Lafitness charged full month reopened week half opened. absolute garbage. True. 

And fact virus attacks destroys white blood cells cells tries remove virus, sometimes referred HIV like properties. 

Because ability novel virus, bodies react destroying living tissue instead destroying actual virus particles.

Executive orders also signed transparent (among things) drone strikes. current administration used way drone strikes also killed many innocent people so. also rolled back Obama era transparency laws never take responsibility mistakes, ever. Therein lies difference. Acknowledging mistakes, transparency, accountable. current administration lacks three.

Some friends currently meetings university management weighing loss room &amp; board fees, student fees, bookstore income, lack college sports income, students protesting lower quality online learning insisting refunds multiple classes, etc. university goes completely online, absolutely screws international students can't go home - stay US four years, they're street dorms close.

It's clusterfuck. seems part people tend forget re-opening schools... teachers staff keep school running. want much kids want normal school day. honestly never considered that, may onto something here. led ridiculous situations like [in face veils banned face masks required! absolute feverish opposition face veils something I've dealt directly, know it, seriously affected policy quite lot places.

So yeah, absolutely could bit spillover cognition things mask/face covering requirements.  Seems worked live Spain. Alert remaining restrictions basically feels like we're back normal.

We already blood violence, without revolution. can't speak Sonora specifically, situation Mexico probably worse here. Mexican president dumber trump Please continue downvote posts mental health impacts COVID protocols. That's real good look selectively ignoring particular data Also US flattened curve all. much reasonable return school virus greatly diminished. accomplished that.

Obviously case real life sake simplicity we'll run it.

Almost current testing designed specifically trigger antibody responses. peer reviewed research count facts? large ignoring real fucking important consequence response disease happens kill people likely gonna die next years anyway.

What causal way hand wave thousands actual deaths millions potential deaths.

It‚Äôs binary. options. It‚Äôs perfectly possible reasonable address mental health issues without allowing millions die pandemic. Skeptical vaccine work skeptical they'll make available public? March 2019 one actually Spain (Barcelona). mean unless local shouldnt risk drinking it...my family Peru drink local city tap water fine get shits everytime do. also favorite street food(creamy tropical fruit smoothie) made using tap water buy flavors, drink one day get shits beginning trip everytime visit [how Dr. Chau today:

*April State's reporting system, added COVID serology tests auto processed tests. team captured test results part COVID tests report, error leadership became aware around June 3rd.*""

""*The State knows added serology PCR State calculated positivity rate never included serology tests. State knows serology test meaning include that's lab reported CalREDIE...the calculation included positivity rate*""  makes complete sense unfortunately. anti-intellectuals running track speak 2016 &amp; ""alternative facts"" allowed continue full steam ahead, giving way believe literally whatever tf wanted &amp; ""good"" hard science minds. meaning sound disrespectful snotty you, Christian, let tell separation church state good church state.

In much (quite reasonably) don‚Äôt want religious beliefs ruling life, mixing church state means state can‚Äôt make decisions church, either.

Prime example: Nazis took power Germany near start world war two, Christians began protest Nazi‚Äôs heinous actions. Well Hitler, Hitler, appointed Nazi sympathizers high church positions, held conference, Christians Germany essentially told that, based often misinterpreted passage book Romans, *all Christians must obey laws government without question.*

I‚Äôll steer clear theological ramifications statement, suffice say, lack separation church state gave church great deal trouble. Separation best option parties.

Just we‚Äôre clear, totally understand frustration. ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù (and use term loosely) think ‚ÄòGod-given mission‚Äô force everybody live strict moral code, that‚Äôs awful misrepresentation bible. mission, first foremost, love. often, don‚Äôt.

This getting long... let round saying people don‚Äôt wear masks stupid. live Texas‚Äîheck, i‚Äôd even call proud Texan‚Äîand i‚Äôm *still* embarrassed people community. people don‚Äôt wear masks places like grocery stores, won‚Äôt wear church either, hate that, particular church made predominately sensitive old people. even still, people know right things.

My point this: real Christians aren‚Äôt get you. us deal virus way everyone else does: wearing masks, practicing social distancing, washing hands. virus ought bringing us together rather tearing us apart. Hey, right now...

Maybe stay there.

Like...

Fuck's sake.

DON'T COME BACK CAME FROM. sub retarded 

We regurgitating stuff months ago, everyone already knows people get sick getting tested? USA! USA! USA! ""a bunch virtue signaling don‚Äôt want face facts pandemic.""  Unless type huge pain ass. NEW RECORD  long shit completely hits fan entire US lockdown again? 

The odds US second lockdown 0. economy important, there‚Äôs way stop sacrificing people make appear it‚Äôs better shape reality.  great USA smashing records ""winning"" every day!

They could reached manufactures start focusing cloth masks, like now. could forced manufactures sell government/hospitals/etc. could educated public importance masks- yes N95 best, much better scarf, handkerchief, shirt nothing. could jump started entire mask making industry months earlier help allevate strain give people options. instead lied said anything help- lost lot credibility needlessly put people's lives risk. IMO.  What's worst case scenario here? Outside ppl sick dying...  Hopes prayers 1. Indoor restaurants need shut
2. Fake restaurants mostly serve alcohol need shut completely 
3. Another stay home order
4. stimulus checks need sent 

This hard know, actually grew Europe, crossed Atlantic 20 years ago. I've seen sides. think country monopoly crazy. anything, Americans pretty good figuring common sense, workable solutions.

But every culture blind spots, stuff never gets fixed except hard way.

I dunno. Maybe I'm wrong. Time tell. I'm hoping real news possible Covid19 vaccine ayurvedic scam again. World War 3 New Zealand, Taiwan, lesser extent Singapore; country mostly eradicated disease faces problem, get back normal without re-starting local pandemic experience.

Countries side, impact exposure, face opposite daunting problem; fourth population disease work another half getting achieve herd immunity, may even work. wish could lie take 3 year nap. Wake 2023.

Ah, probably insurance thing. participated threads can't tell people watch news commentary what's actually going on. one wants believe they're hoodwinked.

I work hospital. We're seeing community spread. We're seeing COVID parties.

Every year, judgmental adults hear news stories true rainbow parties Momo COVID parties.

We seeing parents terrified work, grandparents babysitting teens, sometimes children.

There occasional party goer people sincerely scared thing want stay home. lockdown northeast US two months, around March 15 May 15. infection rate similar European nations same. People outside US trouble getting scale country. Look CHina, another big nation... experience Wuhan anything like rest nation. state 3.5 million 2 deaths Covid 19 today. one worst outbreaks nation March. positive test rate around 0.6% now. humiliating lumped southern US.

If lived southern US would thinking moving northeast. educational attainment, life expectancies, income levels, standard living rival wealthiest European states. Italy far onerous lock downs nyc, Spain. Spanish kids inside weeks end NYC joggers dodging past one another. 

I live Newport,ri. early influx NYC folks ""escaping.""

Eh, doesn‚Äôt matter. People probably think I‚Äôm asking attempt downplay, genuine curiosity. also kinda phrased question weird. Like know kids infected, curious understood better effects children, what‚Äôs severity also easily spread child parent. rush couldn‚Äôt say that. Hey that's true!

The women children poor white. can't shoot rich white women children crazy? bleakest report ever seen. problem reports way many environmental factors studied. point time believe one expert one study deserve merit since way many contributing data points. key look many studies draw conclusion. remember one ep plant face bowl worms. know worst, show existed saw ep it. Yep. buy it. Blame CDC want, common sense prevails. there's pandemic involves airborne virus, **common sense** wear mask.

Vary information consumption. source Fox News mommy groups Facebook, informed. *only one month later* 

""Mask mandate lifted COVID-19 cases increasing 1400 every day instead 1500."" Hey,

Herd immunity come. 

Many die work. He's going fill yes-men, scared corrupt go agaisnt him. whole European Union tested anywhere near rate US multiple EU countries much higher death rates per million US.  again, doesn‚Äôt mean Trump doesn‚Äôt suck, mean reddit ignores numbers contradict narrative ‚ÄúEurope good USA bad‚Äù. Apparently ""remember Alamo"" means ""let's go another massive defeat"" many tens thousands people die Florida make difference? Pretty sure week lost control Feb/March president called hoax. definitely getting worse week, let's pretend hundreds deaths per day ""under control"". I'd... I'd tell GTFO coffee shop get badge numbers. Except whole point compare US UK... peoples lives obsessing covid cases, can‚Äôt enjoy life productive basic hygiene. It‚Äôs eND WoRLD. Idiots, death rate keep dropping test more. Lockdowns complete waste terrible idea. currently working vaccine naive virus even underestimating Headline: validating fears

Article: ""a new study suggests"". ""The study's authors say research needed"". Sample size 23 ages 7 16..

Dumb lazy irresponsible Wearing mask least keeps touching face. see win. Even abstract contradictory: 
‚ÄúChildren seem drive transmission severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). isolated culture-competent virus vitro 12 (52%) 23 SARS-CoV-2‚Äìinfected children; youngest 7 days old. findings show symptomatic neonates, children, teenagers shed infectious SARS-CoV-2, suggesting transmission plausible.‚Äù Oh, never getting news, I'm trying take trash! happens idiots flatten curve. Source? seems way certain portion population would take seriously death (or least infirmity) nearly instantaneous, like Stand.

Smallpox eradicated. Polio longer widespread, HIV survivable. Death mostly happens sight, hospitals nursing homes. Typhoid, typhus, diphtheria, etc., impact lives.

Has America forgotten ""afraid"" contagious diseases? contributing resistance take precautions help, mixed signals political leaders ""muh freedoms.""

Caveat regarding Gov. Abbott's mask order Texas: Places worship exempt, people ""are encouraged"" wear masks. Good idea. Let's pack 10,000 people mega-churches every Sunday, without masks social distancing, let folks loose population. still many people sub believe current exponential growth cases US end world. Yes, horrible, testing also quadrupled since previous peak, deaths going despite since sustained exponential growth two weeks now. Yes, US brought second wave dumb political decisions, extremely unlikely bad April. important alarmed inform others bad turn events, making baseless claims helping cause. fuck would downplay bad COVID losing parents it? Definitely BS. Either legitimately crazy person incapable emotion. Ignorance? What? actual lockdown -- like happened Rome, Paris, Milan, Barcelona, etc. -- might feature:

-Self-declaration forms leave house/apartment (checked police)

-Fines breaking rules form 

-Not leaving NYC metro area unless essential reasons work/health (i.e. wanting ""quarantine"" Miami see boyfriend LA reason!)

-Extremely limited take-out food options

-Only allowed exercise outside within mile one's home limited amount time day

-Parks/gardens closed You.... can‚Äôt find comment made earlier today? That‚Äôs right one thread? 

Oh. Ok. appreciate wife making story public warning others happen even healthy people. mercy immune systems make 'choices' 'minds' say in.

The think control limit exposure virus.

Wishing best available outcomes Mr. Codero - whatever may be. I've actually heard described whipped cream turning clay. Please safe neighbors south. Scary times! they‚Äôre super spreaders every contact airborne illness news item anyone immunity lasts 6 months vaccine effective 6 months well. 

There papers hypothesizing herd immunity may happen levels low 45%. formula gives 60-70% number assumes homogeneous population, practice many social connections likely get virus earlier pandemic also likely spread disease carry weight contribution herd immunity.

Unless vaccine forthcoming Covid going work way population one way another. Suppression costs ""science fact"" one many strategies need explored. god now? Even hitler blew head cause handle reality, well everybody idiotic religious dumb fuckers.  anymore. 20% positive. California might able use even testing rate getting bit high. Yet dumbshits wear shirts shoes businesses never think twice 'muh freedumb'. shirtless really killed anyone, yet oblige law like lemmings. people lemmings...they told 'its like flu' ya go. fact governments US keep taking reactionary action rather preventative action 3 months thing started incredible cost countless lives aww, west coast good sushi Asian food though...

-signed, someone east coast Asian food even come close :( I'm sorry. Teachers deserve better. deserve better. Take care That's actually fantastic prescription certain politicians pick public health management pharmacy. Thanks posting this. Gonna watch now. 18% psitive rate (and growing), ZERO benefit pooled testing time.

* 86% 10 pools come back positive, 
* 63% 5 pools come back positive.

Net effect double testing time virus doubling within 2 weeks. 

I believe pooled testing would actually HARM Florida. us first half, gonna lie. Since one else mentioned it, university since backtracked policy. handling thing well lately, guys. humbling. I've realized I'm nearly strong mentally thought was. I'm basically coming look *Good News* tagged posts leaving. Please tell end one day... know. I'm pathetic. Yeah, imagine future burden healthcare system going larger anyone wants consider. look promising. died day contracting? day saying regretted contracting? experience northeast US sounds like France european nations I'm seeing south. blame sides sheep‚Äôs listens innocent till proven guilty way. Cops can't give ticket Thank saying allegedly common first name. shit beyond old someone afflicted it. (Who would not, incidentally, caught fucking dead Disney pandemic). feel like they're taking baby steps toward locking again. kind stuff helps going stop virus.

Not that, they'll probably complain fix everything right away.

They understand transmission, understand masks, get time lag infection, understand time lag overwhelming hospitals, time lag deaths.

Masks stop new infections 2-3 weeks. They're going lot sick people currently infected Maybe Americans end watch CFL football fix year.  Sitting home twitter getting fat fuck preaching morality. Aka 80% reddit Superspreaders virus? links? ""leadership"" Trump co. basically ""this fine"" meme whole room fire. actual adult POTUS role afraid show weakness admit there's problem, would coherent honest message coming above. Irresponsible governors would less mandate trade lives profits. Trump stuck fingers ears, denied there's problem, allowed chaos reign. There's coherent cohesive message highest level government. respected medical journals world published reports dangers HCQ based bad data. And, believed it. still do. Even thought it‚Äôs proven derived false data. Guys, 6 figure numbers 1 day real goal. chump change. Get beach!!

But seriously, stay home save lives guys...  Holy shit, FOUR?!? four year old can‚Äôt wipe butt, afraid washing machine draining,

‚ÄúGovernor Brown authority take civil liberties. aren‚Äôt going wear masks,‚Äù trooper allegedly said, according written statement Boss provided newsroom.

The trooper proceeded place order, Boss said interview, offering foul-mouthed retort governor‚Äôs mandate masks worn within indoor public spaces.

Not single employee hardware store wearing mask.  customer wearing mask. Coming back place stop get fuel, person six-tier gas station wearing mask.  Tried install needed longer pigtail. Go smaller chain hardware store near them. single employee wearing mask, me. 

People ain't wearing mask shit. know God engineer. else would put parks recreation next sanitation? Companies use [Prison make average .15¬¢ hour may referring initial case fatality rate, testing ramped up, retarded assumed deaths divided cases true fatality rate, roughly around 4-5%. regardless, get nonchalant attitude towards 5% death rate catastrophic number haha.

Luckily CDC continued adjusting IFR estimate, currently 0.26%. quite bit deadly flu 0.1%, certainly death sentence overreaction perpetuated February. People world travel interact.

Well, come here, can‚Äôt go back.  Basically one letting Americans past borders right now. Except possibly Brazil. Unfortunately true BC. I'm bus 11 people 2 us wearing mask. least we're decently socially distanced.... see, thanks. Since I'm sure say her, guess I'll leave door open, speak. think us must best days. I'm spacey scared shitless myself.

If nightmare ever over, maybe friend ok too. It‚Äôs little late. Let's forget (ongoing) misinformation campaign. saw Lieutenant Governor say listen Fauci. Ehhh...depends...

Grades flawed. also need way judge students progress provide motivation. also flawed agree.. that‚Äôs reform another day! China first outbreak; however, looking like disease circulating globally months Chinese identified late December 2019:

* France found case community transmission nearly month prior.
 
* Brazil found sewage waste month prior.

So, no, really. nearest test happens reasonable time.

Edit: get one done reasonable timeframe drive Mayo clinic. Many us rural midwest level access care, numerous hours away get major hospital. 30 years. still performing first place? even like back then. Keep going! merrier right? ... randomized clinical trial (which failed) another retrospective study state, police exempt laws, mandates accountability. understand. Every kid different. got lucky front. things quite easy.... numbers perspective, India US always high considering populations Canada day festivals parties. worth like Florida. rate, US fighting Covid 19 decade. point we're gonna see events whether want to. way nearest test 5 hours you. liar got called out.

None us getting alive Cry baby idiots like freedom?? Darth Vader born Since neither country actually taking steps completely eradicate virus, reality still pursuing herd immunity strategy slightly different rates. Keep profits rollin' 1% corporations! battling Trump‚Äôs administration Day 0 get virus control. efforts undermined Trump every step way. 

I can‚Äôt wait Trump gone people like Fauci damn jobs. wait finally honest Trump‚Äôs shitshow. beautiful date US, ADA can't force someone provide proof disability regrets nothing now. Florida's hospitals capacity yet? Maybe he's waiting like Texas.  Seeing police utterly useless unless want someone get shot, no, be.

Quarantine home least 14 days long ill need hospital. cities also provide apartments hotel rooms quarantining someone want stay home though norm quarantine home. quarantine ends negative test. really allowed go outside door that.

They get surprise visits phone calls (works least landline phones). home get fine even prison sentence theoretically possible. treated like bodily harm attempted bodily harm someone worst cases fines get 25.000 Euro prison sentence 5 years. GOP convention Jacksonville. Buckle Florida. Well, technically &lt;50 could zero. wish news sites reported biggest decreases.

Now looks like literal competition Deaths per million:

On hand piss poor education system today Americans. There‚Äôs decent education kids take things like AP IB classes. know schools state (Florida) IB program basically creates two systems within school: one driven, college-bound kids learn; one kids fight hallways, watch movies class, given busywork braindead assignments kids IB program could‚Äôve completed fourth grade. 

Kids see making waves media part first system. don‚Äôt ever hear kids system. We‚Äôre really failing kids second system.

Correct. issue impossible rule opportunities spread. limit lot them, whether possible bring R0 zero place like New York really understood yet. might lucky New Zealand lower population density gives opportunity contain places like New York London don't. also one strictest lockdowns high compliance

Seems anecdotal rather factual. going awhile serious studies subject compliance start coming out. Without real data analysis hard make comparisons. can't assume a) good results lockdown therefore b) must good compliance measures. need data make links, gut look actual restrictions put place, pretty clear.

You mean, make complete guess expertise training subject hard data back claims. Yeah, sure thing lol Well imagine weren‚Äôt fudging numbers? He's ventilator ecmo (lung life support). take ventilator put ecmo full settings oxygen sat drop. He's using lungs he's ecmo.

(tob-rorrim) mentioned NYT: [Can Algorithm Predict Pandemic‚Äôs Next developed model uses social-media search data forecast outbreaks Covid-19 well occur. fact every statement says starts ‚ÄúWell Trump says‚Äù may telltale Insane!! city?? Embry Women‚Äôs Health still testing blitz last looked! test free - Chandler.

Edit: looked site again. Yes, still testing everyone wants it, they‚Äôve got three locations now. Real talk think coronavirus much bad news come people kind geared expect worst Also biological warfare. fucktard politicians started encouraging joining protests, fucking rules got thrown window, one gave fuck social distancing long thousands people packing streets everyday wearing chin protectors feeling great spewing little spiky balls everywhere. countries anti lockdown protests. seems aggressive, though. Fuck. willing risk life see ""Go Ninja Go"" live. Lt Gov clarified site hacked. case counter is/was experiencing technical difficulties. main page coronavirus.ohio.gov showing increase cases par 1300 increase, see update various dashboards never understood police given leniency law. ones enforcing it, held much higher standard public, less. possibility school staff would consider nationwide strike working conditions raging pandemic? I'm asking seriousness, honest concern. makes confident contagious viruses exist? I've read bit terrain theory research would ever compare decades research hands experience led modern medicine? 

Do work medical field? used scientific method test terrain theory yourself? understand would grand conspiracy mislead public believing germ theory terrain theory. understand media leaders multiple nations would lie global pandemic. people personally affected Covid19 making stuff up? apologize bombarding questions I'm genuinely fascinated someone could come view world do. That‚Äôs cute. wait mass graves. /s  Help understand someone another country. logic - enforcing mask wearing violate civil rights citizens.

So... walk outside naked that's want? begins. suspect many universities following suit next weeks/months   ""Twice number cases today"" probably past, testing capacity now. ton undiagnosed cases.

Edit: oops, made comment without reading middle bit made point. Well least next time big pandemic hits us life time better prepared. (By mean people wearing masks social distance) Looks like we're well way cracking 60K end week.

Coincidentally, county announced days ago would stop reporting numbers weekend. Saturday Sunday numbers added Monday evening. Please MM/DD/YYYY making graph Americans, DD/MM/YYYY confusing us Secret sauce get party. friend already. die covid 1 day. There's real incubation (and infective period). honestly dumbfounded? Like least 40 years GOP propaganda work. vote poverty leaders get rich. They've sold idea they're poor liberal elites keeping want ruin Constitution, fucking lap up. Every little fucking word.

The American experiment done unless somehow flip everything blue pass laws fix bullshit fake information network. Well that‚Äôs dumb 50% Texans claiming medical exemptions aren‚Äôt required disclose medical issues HIPPA. Oh ignorance state. *cries Floridian* Rogan TX? right statewide. Still little higher I'm personally comfortable with. would never move Texas. think type people would like Texas would never ever want leave Texas. 

Every place charm certain groups. city fireworks undisclosed location live streamed. Still sure ended done, pretty loud house must somewhere side city. pretty sure 10 active cases province. Honestly, think high percentage people give shit even lose 100k day. Unless affects loved ones, give flying fuck it. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* blood Jesus protect you! Glad see governor governing. But, boy oh boy, libs. New York resident here, we‚Äôve went back 1,000 cases one day Cuomo says sees storm horizon. didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd keep numbers low everything opening back up. Even keeping restaurants bars closed indoor dining NYC. Um never seen sidewalks New York City? Apparently rest state allowed enjoy bars in-house dining. According Covid tracing unit NY longer ahead virus like last week. top I‚Äôm seeing license plates Kentucky Carolina‚Äôs over. states cancel Fourth July festivities flocking try escape virus like many New Yorkers leaving state hit here. we‚Äôll see Cuomo puts us back lockdown again.  Obesity normalized US nobody even comments anymore. issue people even highly obese people (BMI 40) youth still present normal biomarkers turn 40 machine falls apart quickly.

Please wash hands, cover face believe death real. it‚Äôs coming. spikes devastating. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôll see. Take care follow Fauci. thing happening California:  sure id say Melbourne second wave. like 50 new cases single day. hiccup. We're already back lockdown. We're managing fine. keep playing whack mole. right approach. We'll never eradicate it, need ensure explode.

You need accountability consequences though. government doesn‚Äôt follow rules, people ask, people?

It‚Äôs happened UK. Dominic Cummings (big government advisor) broke rules shattered government‚Äòs credibility. People used excuse break rules. (according comments above), first wave never stopped, neither would fatalities. upward movement cases *should* result similar upswing deaths, that's case. Remember, two-week lag.

Even every single person state stopped seeing masks political thing started wearing them... hundred percent effective... next two weeks going worse. I'm mostly left protests worried spike. Seems like state (IL) somehow avoided significant spike now, though, that's relief (don't know how, protests huge rioting extremely bad Chicago). doubt we're going see spike point, especially Fall. Charges need brought people acting like this. countries it, need states well. type behavior otherwise breeds c0vidiots Dude show class. Trust I'm disgusted selfishness I've seen displayed since started sometimes remind depending solely tv news update virus reddit might fully understand severe situation is. care human passing away least keep put type depressing comment there. Lol good point There, science may help get things context: Less people go things. saw Tulsa. age groups ppl getting identified new cases? Wrong person. Sorry bud. 20% down. states order? assume entire U.S. like Florida. states pretty well incredibly careful.

With situation, U.S. really thought two separate countries (as things, really). One retarded, one isn't. Terrible actually hiding it, people keep denying one blatant Nurglite dog-whistle another. going vote now? Yep, one thing survive. thing burning general population. time reopen surge. mind well ride make waves

this sounds like rip current mean disrespect, he‚Äôs also 60 pounds overweight. 99% fatalities 65 obese.

Regardless, one deserves die this. Rest peace. Seriously, wolf handled better governed I‚Äôve heard people call dictator wolf. truly don‚Äôt understand. updated constantly got worse world ""kind of"" locking down. destroyed economy, shitload people ended dying. really locked down, economy would taken bigger hit, MUCH bigger, lot people would lived didn't. could gone Sweden this, economy would better (not fine, better), cost load lives. I'm (like, hope, people) former camp, wrecked economy amongst many cases frustrating sad. 


Hell, keeping things fully open near 100% mask usage well might better got. bad that's much ask. Online school, or, hybrid model serious tackling issues come up. temporary.

Yeah, I'm sure death situations like, since deaths lagging factor take forever certified etc, deaths spike while. There's definitely large amount uncounted deaths, since things relatively calm May, think record deaths May early June anything.

Not say think deaths get really bad. absolutely new cases. agree May early June definitely less cases, thus less deaths, mention fact doctors know know better treat patients.

Oh, that's premium. 10/10. Ah yes, nothing reopening everyone packing bars restaurants without masks. 

Let‚Äôs blame protests outside wearing masks. Victimhood? No. trying inject little reality doomsdayers subreddit. seven-day average positive rate 6 percent June article puts average see, published within last days. believe 7 day average better way look numbers, bc daily testing fluctuates certain days week.

at point it‚Äôs longer laughing stock. It‚Äôs sad. Including fact states STILL trying open up. I‚Äôve even friend post story ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt help.‚Äù

We‚Äôre focused trying go back ‚Äúnormal lives‚Äù we‚Äôre ironically pushing back. didn‚Äôt learn anything flu 1918. think lot dad. healthier 70 30. still working full time although lost mom year ago, alright. man depend anyone. company help technology. thought could survived situation something hard consider. miss dad everyday wish i‚Äôm sure would worth knowing wouldn‚Äôt man always was: strong, healthy independent. i‚Äôm sorry loss. there‚Äôs words. pandemic robbed many people much. make fun everyone Canada, know it‚Äôs joke., original post, don‚Äôt need lecture Alabama folk don‚Äôt fuck families, know (probably) don‚Äôt, sense humor , world fucked right laugh lol know shit. brother cousin told shit sniffles vaccine coming gonna chipped Bill gates 5g chemtrail concentrates fluoride gonna try convince earth sphere ""human induced global warming"". Gimme break ... moon landing, 9/11, false flags.......clintons Wow. someone dumb? Hahaha seriously though place sucks  Houston Chinatown area good restaurants.

Chinese restaurants spread Dallas Plano good ones. Jesus protects virus? 

Why churches still exempt taxes health requirements? See, thing think human life value. Maybe that's foreign concept you, me, preventable deaths actually bad. choices endangering others, get make them. Here‚Äôs symptom larger problem. MERS saw increase cases 2020... dumb? government stringent rules testing done. Making difficult many people want tested get tested.

Living Tokyo. understanding requirements stringent compared start year, least paper.

I however still concerned lightly people taking it. really hope exception, still see people maskless social distancing even practical. fact still said lol counties US generally receive cash state ?  
Any pressures state exert ?   
Not expect would let's pretend things run reasonably. movie enough Lincoln action it. stupid thing is, cost job, massive economic cost impact every American soon.

So cost people big time. lot money disappear pockets. without good leadership, party go on, untill beer runs out, suppose. dam, tweet series like /r/agedlikemilk material. Fauci full shit horrible part tried retrace steps say masks work, people werent paying attention anymore. people remember people like Surgeon General saying ""dont wear masks, dont work"".

They entire nations attention weeks couple months, failed. Horribly. WTF about? rural areas cesspool meth opioid induced bat-shittery. Fool once. Shame you. Fool twice, can't fooled again.

Folks... deed... educate voting vote person ""R"" next name. really say that? mean, seriously, big shiny red flag‚Ä¶ Oh boo hoo said alot virus caught, all, learn read cases reported traveling state least 60 different locations,‚Äù Allegheny County, PA health officials said. ‚ÄúBeach towns along coast Carolinas including Myrtle Beach Hilton Head, cities Florida Miami, Orlando, Clearwater Tampa; Raleigh, Youngstown, Houston Nashville come often interviews new cases.‚Äù Yet Lost little brother flu two years ago. Hearing upsets me. I've saying silver lining states opening things back quickly ways help people take seriously, surges obvious, inevitable result. shutting early on, general North American able nip much bud many places, lead false sense security last 4 weeks so. move summer, think people already starting see real, fad passing thing, something dealing next year, longer. reliable vaccine. Period. 

I think concept many people simply know even begin coming terms with, people know get this, maybe begin to.  point think argument he's making based current data continued lockdowns may worthwhile, detrimental overall reversing them. 

Im comfortable opinion matter, guy alone. There's reasons Sweden took approach did. 

I discovered guy's twitter find interviews various experts ""unherd"" YouTube channel. right-leaning seem, get past find interviews.

But I'm inclined disbelieve Fauci/CDC. semblance answers month, I'd imagine.

The problem contagious, people risk severely risk, mortalitt low enough people inclined care. quite moral quandary. think extreme measures help vulnerable--5 grand month, delivery service, etc. America needs stupid right now. actually medical conditions exist really prevent wearing mask? seeing many people claim work think complete bullshit get wearing mask.

I feel like actually condition made impossible wear mask, would either a) come work safe catching virus likely extremely dangerous b) much better protections basic mask since actually dangerous catch it. Please say that. Unemployment dropped 11%. Jobs coming back. 42 like profile states age range .009% Infection Fatality Rate, 90 ppl million age range 20 49 pass away this. Wear mask please stay healthy. sub nothing doomers. We'll get big hug.


Here's data IRF already Antibody tests show exposure virus developed antibodies it. 

Testing virus using PCR sequencing shows whether virus currently present system. 

The problem virus, produced antibodies yet. Also don‚Äôt know certain whether large enough number people create antibodies c19 whether long term short term. seen anything even suggesting that. first place ""fudged"" numbers paint rosier picture. Florida got caught calculating positivity rate positive people / TOTAL tests, took 3 samples (tests) single patient positivity rate artificially decreases. 

Now ""might"" mistake, spent lots time data... someone make decision. Even low level peon know better pulled data, someone know better ok it. best incompetence negligence, really unlikely. feel it? America great again! Damn, beginning week thought would insane hit 50 week. one hell username.  ‚ÄúAmerica number 1!!!!!‚Äù - Borat, 2006 People like blame who's White House always happening America. Ridiculous people must suffer sense, must remove hierarchical blasphemy return traditional social structure working welfare tribe gain one human, tribalism.  fully support seatbelts, same. seat belt potentially save wearer, mask (covering) potentially protect wearer around them. used drink 3 days straight Eye-na-zation da aiiire. 99.9% 10 minutes.  cases recovered folks long term health problems? mean careers players over? Give 17 üòÇ Yeah well virus disappears! I'm saying aliens...but aliens... word ozarks doing? entirely true. Japan partial lock-down. think could've worked US, federal government would've behind expressed seriousness it.

If majority people cut much unnecessary travel, able stay home sick without fear losing jobs generally respect social distance/masks rules. seems enough curb spread cases.

And course ban large crowds. Worse still, people forced back work companies even provide medical insurance coverage.     certainly ego, though I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs earned bit it. sure dig employees work comes - that‚Äôs company works? He‚Äôs done engineering work i‚Äôve yet hear anyone who‚Äôs met say he‚Äôs competent technically. accounts initial technical modeling prove SpaceX Tesla viable done primarily him. 

He seems near edge spectrum probably partially explains dickishness also success. Like SARS MERS did?  Actually think presence leadership Fox News social media putting lives risk. country would better leadership truly absent. fair, look Fox News main page. haven‚Äôt mentioned numbers week. People get news don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs happening. USA needs new government 3rd political party, archaic BS call Electoral College gutted fuck out, fuck undemocratic garbage. Yes, but...

There testing numbers low. thousands per day.

The government stringent rules testing done. Making difficult many people want tested get tested.

This may indicative larger (but much smaller US) problem.  SYMPTOMATIC


Illuminati‚Äôs covid code nations‚Äô borders governments stopping us leaving US. definition left wing anyone bat shit insane. always thought Fox News monster, Herald OAN. Ironic isnt it? Lack unified response *United* States. totally agree words dunno, maybe jack booted thugs enforcing mask order protesters arguing about. USA USA USA!!!!!! PA. many people give shit anything matter. Like want school every person expernace senior year person. right it‚Äôs safest continue distance learning safety us. I‚Äôve gotten sick school pandemic I‚Äôm pretty sure COVID19 Would spread quickly too. sucks life safety comes first. Could getting second time now? asymptomatic ones people tcell antibodies? 

Can someone explain Nancy charge House. charge. talking masks submitting bill say supports. Honestly, see new every day. US recordholder beating record Nebraska didnt really lock down. stay home order. gyms even stayed open. Governor said trusted people right thing, meanwhile social media countless videos people throwing sizable house parties. People like roommate saw inconvenience couldnt go normal gym. since everything open, people stopped paying attention like never happened.

Then try point anything out, like countries great job containing outbreak, people say lying case numbers.

I blame CDC government. dont expect people smart responsible enough whats right, often told. isnt even close... Instead guy's mental estimate IFR, here's numbers NYC approximated researchers Columbia: 25-45 age group, 0.12%. mean yeah that's low, comparison flu 

But even distracts real discussion: could easily completely squashed virus economy back running near 100% turned mask wearing/social distancing/etc. fucking political football, real leadership federal level around shutdowns, testing, prophylaxis contact tracing.

But hey, let's keep pointing probably kill younger 45 (I mean, probably kill 75+ either, 13.8% IFR!). fix rest failures! Brazil half cases America 10% test done... I'm afraid real situation looks like Stay away Florida, wayyyy much risk poorly written article.. yes it‚Äôs promising haven‚Äôt put bulk testing (gotten results) mom signed trial us they‚Äôre screening boarding people rna vaccine trials (first small amount gauge dosage response side effects, trail larger set people phased stop needed issues), even proving it‚Äôs safe still prove effectiveness cause know science, validate actually confers degree immunity long? still lots hurdles hurdles regardless vaccine question. it‚Äôs glimmer hope still hurdles proven date isnt rna vaccine that‚Äôs approved mass consumption would first it‚Äôs kind successful. it‚Äôs going bit waiting game phase testing proceeds Occupy Wall Street retail worker stay calm much shit cop wouldn‚Äôt able to.

Give seen conservative meme wearing mask 2020 becomes mandatory burka 2025? 

If go /r/conservative. posted couple times day love time. Sadly first thing comes mind potential news making people US less responsible distancing masks. teetering edge going full ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù mode. support police, stupid shit like (and certainly unequal policing based upon skin color).

Why many police officers making police officers look like horrendous shits? survive suffer effects lifelong chronic health issues Descendent criminals skirting around law... Sound almost like movie Masks = Open Businesses. What‚Äôs excuse? read article yesterday. believe CNET. Personally, I'm counting check hands. Yeah I‚Äôm pretty safe. house make filtrete material. group good cops need get shit together stop rioting. Kobe's death seems long ago it. include law enforcement won‚Äôt wear mask too?  It‚Äôs fucked. Australia, lockdown, quite solid control. Fucking Victorians skirted around 14 day hotel quarantine, sharing cigarette lighters allowing ‚Äúconjugal‚Äù visits.

We went basically cases eighty case spike.

Stupid bastards UK definitely still part Europe. Leaving European Union (EU) doesn‚Äôt mean moved island different continent. Almost sounds like setup really depressing Twilight Zone twist. Millions people rush unsafe vaccine, what‚Äôs worse happen? 

But serious, anyone know worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened clinical trial vaccine that‚Äôs generally non-rushed? Death? Third arm? Mild headaches? assume scientists smart enough efforts aren‚Äôt *so fucking disastrous* even clinical trials? bad Germany EU countries? Gasp! That's it! Holy Shit realized this?!? xenophobia killing people. police department say incident. ‚ÄúOSP early investigation, found true, thoroughly disappointed expect troopers follow governor‚Äôs executive orders examples community.‚Äù

All happen police ""disappointed"" happened. it. thousands tiny counties, asshole sheriff. Half Amarillo dry county.

Power move single person nation elected lead time crisis. single person could lead use something like war, depression, pandemic. Someone could assemble best have, create plan, make tough decisions, provide us path forward.

If only. using numbers. know full population number around 1%. That's 2-3 million starters we‚Äôd get 200 million extremely unlikely,

And what's stop this?  It‚Äôs Australia since ministerial responsibility taken seriously. Funny I‚Äôm Vermont see thing. feels like grocery store place pandemic goin on:) Netherlands never outbreak bad Northeast US did.

2.	The county judge county 20 less active cases must submit exemption form affirmatively opting out.

3.	Counties approved exemption GA-29 face-covering requirement listed below.

I don‚Äôt understand voting church one. - would still making exemptions place potentially lots people. Religious belief political belief, it‚Äôs still belief. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs different person elsewhere, beliefs, forced wear mask. difference location actions voting worshipping make, except polling places churches likely crowded average places? wearing mask way protect worked yet. Wash hands too. share results us? Hopefully VA metro lines DC closed discourage going DC fireworks.

Unfortunately, people still pack like sardines wharf watch them. :( got confirmed cases too... Thanks Governor people Florida entitled care children let alone anyone.

Excellent rebuttal üíØ would want split hairs like this. patient recover corona virus. organs not. eventually died organ failure. happened get sick. 32.

I feel like splitting hairs make feel safer. Must nice watching tyt said Trump may pushing another round stimulus checks, possibly even higher initial $1,200 necessarily wanting extend unemployment benefit. order without enforcement would still increase mask usage somewhat, significantly. think wrong. First thing noticed fucking idiot went worst place possible.

If want get Right fired gotta use boogeyman Sad much focus US shifted from, ‚Äúhow take care this‚Äù ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt even bad‚Äù big change. Texas, Lt. Governor Governor elected independently Lt. Governor actually significant power state, unlike, example, Vice President United States rarely uses little power (President Senate) actually has. Seeing father basically rebuilt one JHH parts 20 years ago, doubt would take couple days done 8 hours. 100% agree  Yet Florida opposite ?   
I think passed laws saying local laws could superseed state ?    
What good goosed worth gander guess. Rubio would care Hilary President. install period correct Blaupunkt right rain. country told masks work, then, work one direction, told work.

While might garbled politicized media narrative, accurate representation experts ever saying largely anti-mask meme point. 

The messaging experts always clear. like early February, covid yet rampant US, experts telling general public hoard would little protect wearer (true). 

Then, April supply masks quite concern covid widespread, basically said 'okay probably wearing mask, mostly protect others, (still true). 

There's real contradiction, different media narratives present such. much different contradcitory media stories fat good bad, red wine coffee, etc. screwed Native Americans almost every way imaginable point ya gotta ask, fuck South Carolina? become novel writer instead science book editor. get pushed spring hope pull collective heads asses. someone pointed another thread beds need tracking staff. Ghost beds useful anyone. Trump cancelled next Rally actually. Probably attendance issues ""mistake"" made frequently. obviously bad sign. What's worse, American, think, ""That's it?"" Ugh. start looking pneumonia stats year, compare last year.

Not even conspiracy, right there. USA! USA! USA! why? doesn‚Äôt care get it. guess, PR testing corpses pulled ventilator confirm cause death. got NJ. Wow love you, NICEST person I‚Äôve seen Reddit bit, bull crap. I‚Äôm 44 tho, guess I‚Äôll find job mine isn‚Äôt allowed start 17th July, I‚Äôm north Carolina seem one wearing mask lol. Christopher Lee Kidwell. real name, look parent's deaths. easily verifiable.

Stop acting like post inconvenient facts matter majority people mild symptoms CoVid-19 even **Fauci** admitted somehow 'lying'.

It posts like making people push back fail acknowledge true death rate virus. people point out? flip out, hissy fit, say ""THAT'S TRUE!"" 200 decibels true. I'd characterize statement saying big think going find numerous doctors saying true: majority citizenry, CoVid-19 infections mild. 

There place ""polio measles"" ""the common flu"", two options deadliness. board took money lining pockets pay nurses, might catch chill! Yeah everyone, long personally sick there's nothing worry about! /s I'm glad there! boss may least want get virus himself, known source. Probable, wide circulation takes lot time manufacture.  publication says children assumed spread coronavirus proven otherwise. Next week, take corona challenge, sure hit like button smash subscribe like doing. Holy crap, thought going old article published today. Wth living apartment building potential risk AC? lobby public areas. someone infected one unit transmit virus others different units AC system? Yeah big loophole‚Äînot required wear masks ‚Äúany medical condition‚Äù prevents wearing one. requirement specific conditions doctor‚Äôs note something. Anyone make anything, it‚Äôs fine. may result voluntarily, none anti-maskers wearing one, one arrested. comparing flu COVID-19 COVID dangerous? 10% people coming back positive Ebola 70% people coming back positive common cold, I‚Äôd pretty damn concerned 10% test positive Ebola! Doesn‚Äôt matter. could say entire economy. Even vaccine miraculously comes fall....I one, first line Guinea pig Well political leaders flatten curve. still complicated. Even get tested (better before), samples get processed timely manner labs short supplies. Right we're capping average 15k per day, lot get % positive lower (now ~25%ish) can't get testing machines later month. [More Yeah! What's left it!  pure journalistic perspective, here's link Fauci actually saying (says within first 20 seconds so):

 

That UPI article links BBC page links video actually show Fauci saying it. problematic sites we're relying information link another site, links another video/media, link anything all. Yeah touch base common ground different less urgent ""issue"" might little faith original argument thoughts might go further. people tested. - [this entire story people cited article still employed Tesla.

Looks like buy Model 3 :) Every time read this, keep hearing ""We're number 1! We're number 1"" chanting head. Trump likes #1, are!! point depends live possibility overwhelmed. places fine hospital capacity. know know I‚Äôm monster right? 1,200 isn‚Äôt enough 4 months. everything adds starts impact sectors. Inflation doesn‚Äôt appear things averaging whole stays level. slow printing get deflation. economy scary thing look right now. honestly worry people much virus Experience Germany shows schools probably OK, kids catch covid easily seems. Teachers risk meeting breaks catching students. Masks social distancing mandatory though. Also, try spread classes possible. love everything holy... quoted article removed mentioned name. welcome! good night! drive exact reason, thought clever gotcha, guess again.

If think ""perceived fears"" clearly seen death tolls. guess could say that, dont think shocking. existence comically evil person like Tr*mp something thats directly endorsed American institutions. us agree understand it‚Äôs way overhyped. else dumbass? friend. Send message. :)  comparing surveillance laws to.....wear goddamn mask laws? 

What‚Äôre gonna do? Capture images upper face portions use us? Ouch much fun innocent people job, start getting evicted.

Their precious freedom murdering American economy. food longer table, long back time partying Mcdonalds. Yo, seriously..wtf people feeling need ontop you. line store, gas stations... Everywhere. Even like I'm aware it. One favorite moronic presidential moments ever. Well played. Yeah I‚Äôm one them. think it‚Äôs overblown agree DeSantis well. one evangelical churches use? /s  Schools started countries somehow restarted epidemic. know how. kills me. opposite effect. People claiming ""he's giving liberals"" hate state sometimes It‚Äôs good thing kids don‚Äôt grandparents. parents matter. Spread purportedly driven young people right now. might get chronic fatigue syndrome reduced lung function etc they're unlikely die.

Unfortunately spreading opens new vistas vulnerable people die virus. /r/brandnewsentence Without border controls screwed eventually. Okay. Let type slowly seem winner. called S.C.I.E.N.C.E. know may hard concept understand right now. worry little head. based facts reality, misinformation propaganda. We'll take slow. Idiotic. Another month now, Trump still ten points election, party abandon him. one want unpopularity rubbing affecting elections. 

Same thing happened George W. incredibly unpopular end campaigning anyone. toxic. Trump same. like masks fed had. can't forget Trump knows art deal. It‚Äôs almost like opened mouth said words something. It‚Äôs favorite! really matters. listen epidemiologists studied this. hold degrees made plans careers this. cares random people post Facebook persuasive arguments. Look rest ""WORLD"" doing. crazy conspiracy that's one hell conspiracy nations would themselves. Look countries left virus unchecked. Fortunately get see happens see shit going wrong still ignore it. It‚Äôs Musk Trump. Harmeet Dhillon thorn Newsom‚Äôs side so. feasible, try getting tested again. know testing lot states overwhelmed wait times results getting ridiculous, maybe tell testers getting symptoms higher priority? case, forced work, wear mask times try best maintain distance. Good luck, hope feel better soon. Problem people need educating stifled allowed educate. work, tell bill gates want wear mask disrupts facial recognition software. made jokes needing wear mask It‚Äôs America, soviet russia. actually freedom yeah can‚Äôt force people wear masks Ah yes try pick someone, usually insinuate mental illness.

The reality covid-19 *isnt* deadly young people. fact. fact misconstrued message young people don‚Äôt worry. said nothing medical experts spreading message. said professionals, like news media, told us need careful vulnerable friends relatives. argue people *should* get information, that‚Äôs topic. 330 million people country weren‚Äôt consulting scientist. majority looked news. news said young people rarely died lockdowns protect elderly vulnerable. harmful message. original post said. discuss?  Yes, Sheriff Lamb ( ).

He running UNOPPOSED reelection, still went campaigning. bet broke apart UK counties many would higher 27 states. What's point? dont like country country comparison? Brazil longer number 1? play what? Trump said supports masks too. I'm sure context tho sound bite saw local news little bit ago. mean, do. Admissions done professionals. know school districts draw detail. pretty much majority population? Lmao Ah nice job America. proving greatest country earth smashing records. Keep believe you! compounding fast 'MURICA's covid cases Well rate two choices: Fail slowly fail quickly. seem choosing slow method re-openings lockdowns; political back fourths civil rights movements. need let good Lord work pray vaccine available ""for cheap"" next year. makes smarter experts ... tell us... qualified? Move along people nothing see take - floating idea public see people down. think happens simply pointless. entire point 22 team bubble meaningless games played circumstances. Even approve look lot players opt out, especially next season starting December totally pro-vaccine, wary guinea pig one. Luckily, scientist family member whose guidance take time comes.

But even people take it, matter long do?  get disease, maybe maybe won't. That's problem. seems poor return fucking economy. simplest explanation corona virus entered human population either food supply interaction wild animal. need better proof one Norwegian scientist. Anyone wear mask. WEAR MASK! know before, hope now. Hahahah okay good. Usually tell sarcasm online baked couldn‚Äôt figure lol. agree funnier without /s  think AI research for? second Koch net. Agreed. lot wrestlers surprisingly swing right. Undertaker another one, he's apparently regular donor conservative causes. Hell, Broadus Clay (aka Tyrus) Fox News commentator. 

That said, Kane seems appreciate role pretty well it. sense humor wonderful. There's video meeting addressing tourism Knox Country goes cheery speech playing WWE entrance music, putting mask on, putting planted intern-type table going back mayor personality. hilarious watch. 

I think Kane kind right-wing whack job, he's guy probably know he's world politics pick signals experienced local politicians would. 

That said, really needs set example start wearing mask ASAP. read studied humanities, classics philosophy prior medical school Sure

  learned anything. numbers mean jack shit. Look way, ""jobs"" likely super temporary paid. places like act like ""Hey people getting back work."" realize Job Market pretty much still lock down. 

Sure people work home. jobs work home? Cashiers. Waitresses. Bar tenders. etc. pretty much SOL. Hell, bars Restaurants back locked again, even brief moment open. doubt made much money all. well photo sums problems usa facing today  feel bad anyone looks Twitter thinks that's real life.

Lookin you, dude. Yes! Thank asking! first, change method thinking college admissions requirements. Right now, people thread thinking college admissions showing *what done.* grades scores stuff show do, that‚Äôs valuable. problem. 

In reality, college admissions *what think do.* prediction future, rather evaluation past. 

As such, single test study like SATs really meaningless future work. College admissions would rather look grades, look grades context. 3.8 magnet school different 3.8 wealthy, easy school. idiots, know districts half ass AP courses every gets A, also know districts little money support it‚Äôs basically impossible even genius kid get A. 

At university, SAT/ACT scores used first low benchmark. means score least ###. look rest stuff, taking consideration type school at. That‚Äôs mystery all. 

In perfect world unlimited resources, I‚Äôd go SAT/ACTs low benchmark, grades, PERSON placement essays interviews. higher liberal population cities also largest cities US. Many mass protests riots. LA set ablaze several nights. Mass amounts people shouting coupled police use tear gas people coughing everywhere rubbing eyes, literally easiest way spread. high amount new cases young people. Positive side? Natural selection job long stick own?


Who kidding, we‚Äôre fucked species due idiots. imagine bored use guys must be, thankfully NZ still lots going 

Netball, Basketball, Rugby, Rugby League It‚Äôs typo. Be. symptomatic. Context clues.

Testing doubled since April. know accurately. Except documented done numerous states, wellthatbackfiredddd.

Maryland, Texas, Florida, Alaska... basically 50 states documented verified cases people allowed starve death way euthanize them. filled ignorant psycho raised Rush, Hannity, Dan Patrick. Coronavirus bout catch em  Masks N95 really protect you. 

They protect others *from* you.

So, parents theater mask theater filled people wearing masks coronavirus mask parents wearing ineffective.

Whereas, parents coronavirus everyone else wearing masks parents would safer.

Point mostly want go spend time indoors anywhere right unless everyone else wearing mask. everyone masked up, go get get take every precaution. Hospitalizations still low week back february  Smart people, smartest people, high IQs, saying biggest pandemics they've ever seen. Bigger China, India, Brazil. Tremendous pandemics. required protests imagine testing bad partly many politicians want numbers low reopen keep constituents happy. Many politicians enforcing masks measures like Texas' governor probably bc (in contrast states like WA).  Hey.. tried.. I'm still trying.. bunch us are. idiots.. us are.  get billions caring workers. Tourism/hotel taxes. income tax Florida, governor shut down. They're broke.  gods name getting Texan here. live northern suburb Dallas. Please understand backwards. family treating past months never ‚Äúopened‚Äù. remind wife goes ANYWHERE always mask hand sanitizer. time frame, yep. elected one. Now? wants order this? know it‚Äôs leap year, I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs leap several months Cold blooded. Easier said done. way many morons angry wear masks fucks sake.

Well there's fucking problem it? fear think fear, people afraid think fear. 

If dad texting 10 times day message ""Never live fear!"" means he's constant state fear. 

All Trump/GOP=KKK supporters scared, bold, trying make feel better. Come man creative, everyday see exact comment

But answer question: Testing, contact tracing, quarantine, testing, loosening measures cases control.

How Vietnam, country 90 million people, zero death? Talking lmao lunatic Maybe it‚Äôs don‚Äôt care nba, cares. think bigger fish fry. husband sounds dumb. hope gets help needs. Wow... thought trope TV shows. mean actually happens today 'bells whistles tracking' average new car has? Scary. drug reddit hates due Trumps endorsement wont go away... We‚Äôre definitely already there. can‚Äôt even get tested easily half states. Op-Ed pieces really don‚Äôt age well, they. Translation: Asians can't better us white people! June 20th according Siri. So
12 days out. week going best week least next 6, likely best week 2021. 

It's going get rough. Texas fucking huge small town people vote cities 1000 √ó 30= 160,000 30,000?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's title card July. Summer time!!!! reports say protests root huge spike. number cases matter much? least 10 times many people aren‚Äôt record None luchadores infected. complete explanation. I‚Äôd agree observations. Wages stagnated risen inflation. honestly surprised that, COVID really came head US, gigantic opportunity worker strike sake rights. think everyone afraid.  rich signing abort babies. employees rich without healthcare are. Maybe 600k babies would healthy trump administration likes white babies health insurance? want deal abortion need people financially well enough stay together instead running responsibility. know see single white mothers? Cause they're falling class historically reserved without generational wealth privilege. Trump use race divide us throw kind away hold minorities long enough. He's bad everyone! Nice job Florida!


- CCP SHC014 ""our home city fine"". Get outta here. That's everyone around saying roommate's girlfriend positive, gets results tomorrow planning go lake friends, close friend, baby, wife positive. thing closing around us pretend like nothing wrong want admit terrible dealing it. Dude could attack fist, obvious weak spot, nose? That's it, asked it. Probably false considering asymptomatic (sometimes high 50% groups: ) people don‚Äôt get tested. You‚Äôre assuming they‚Äôre blanket screening general population without someone seeking asking tested (false). trust growth rate total volume, simply doesn‚Äôt make sense considering large percentage even may even know they‚Äôre sick. actually... perfect lol. Except leads think believe Bill Gates part hi-tek conspiracy still... success.

But secret reserved open minded people. others need investigate. can‚Äôt him, he‚Äôs ours!! ESPN owned Disney, rona it‚Äôs way Disney stop üòÇ They‚Äôve getting tested daily since March doubt that. Author David Byrne, truly hoisted petard. One hope. feeling hopeful seeing fucking selfish many fellow Americans really are. Honestly, I'd rather dead ""live"" like another year. 

I like 99.9% chance surviving get virus, probably like 30% chance surviving mental illnesses lockdown again.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Basically coronavirus cases plus people treated illnesses due pandemic (few hospital capacity fear getting infected hospitals). I'm jersey, we've pretty well since got fucked early on. snowbirds Benny's force, I've seen shit load Florida Southern plates think 'just go hell home'. We're one of, current, best state path relative normality, people raiding like normal summer. Rt 37 seaside cluster fuck today, probably half state plates (seriously, saw Florida, Texas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts within probably 10 minutes other).

I feel like work getting cases going go shit people think 'hey, Jersey pretty well cases let's go there! they're dickwads sauntering around nose mask Wawa.

So feel exactly coming from, defend Jerseyans (who fucking idiots traveling right now, especially Florida) case count pretty low, last saw believe r0 0.85.

But think feel same, states reversed.

Stay safe!  know, ridiculous, really need cut testing infection rates drop.  Omg read local page yahoo running unopposed. Seriously. Younger people need spread parents first. 

Or giant spike ""unrelated"" flu like deaths pneumonia deaths. 

Either or, maybe both. tuition go r-r-right? Oh bad, I‚Äôll try fix it, thanks Florida 35K new cases day 2 weeks continues like has. take year Florida reach herd immunity stops 35K day 6 months stops increasing 3 weeks. Gabriel said **he knows 30 people contracted novel coronavirus Fremont plant**, said Tesla performs contact tracing, determination 30 people caught disease outside confines factory doesn‚Äôt hold water. guy said want listen Fauci?  Thank insightful informative comment. USA! USA! USA! lol unironically ""well uh yeah maybe domestic abuse happened, technically meet legal definition count lol"" Hot dog neck good affect different people different rates, it‚Äôs complex bug. MAH FREEDOMS. STORM STATE CAPITOL. 'MURICA Jesus Christ laugh :( guys going record there? type measurement gauge lack intelligence, got it. Wtf doing? Thanks seeding us! first message implied Canada 400k cases fortunate, job swing shift 7pm-3am. get home 4 am, sleep kids get 7 am, kids naptime 1 pm (my four year old quiet time), nap 3 pm, chores dinner 530 pm, mom gets home time get work 7 pm. They're bed 8 pm. pretty good sytstem, even subsist coffee, mostly. next week, next next week...2 weeks 4th July weekend show crazy high numbers. literally going 0 social distancing 0 mask used....fuck, wish could leave country we‚Äôre cutoff rest world. might something crazy like ask show Trump ever said drink bleach able she'll stop trusting anything say. bring unrelated untrue statements, instead educate facts masks, listen, accept it. country everyone wears masks, 26 total deaths. Lol true? Smh. median delta doesn‚Äôt explain away dramatic difference outcomes. 

Major hospital network employing numerous medical experts vs you..

I‚Äôm going give benefit doubt produce credentials. don‚Äôt think put together embarrass / trick people taking wrong medicine. Meh. series played out. always go something even weirder even blatantly stupid. There's way would happen real life, somebody would something. Oh realize; bad. mild tragedy. really, really am. We‚Äôre still anxious worried, try keep light pay attention other‚Äôs needs. Oh yes can. guess read heard vast, vast, majority people virus little effect. Especially young working.  seen now, lift restrictions populace ready go spend money. hope so. think see states going panic mode weeks. pressure....  Thank fuck mortality rate. was, would absolutely done piss poor job managing crisis. Trump certainly blamed history books, imo real problem American people. 

Fox News popular news network here. really says all. Keep pedantic, reddit. learn *need* know hour. Stay away others, wash hands, wear mask, wash mask, get new mask, asymptomatic people spread it, damage lungs kill you. go. USA #1 guarantee win yet? next time pandemic... could ignore ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è reassign act like know do... cause dedicated life ot studying diseases. 

Think I'm going go cry now.  Tokyo also dense. many people died there? That‚Äôs spot love USA Fucking mental...sometime next week we'll hit 60,000+ daily July bet we'll see 100k+ unless get aggressive fuck...NOW would worked month ago. probably need least 3 month total lock down. still better 6 month month gonna need still keep nothing.

You gotta harm safe nation. Steal PPE* 100k cases Canada since January. Gene sequence blast joking around. Sorry better next time. There's big difference intelligence wisdom. 20 somethings always choose go partying friends low perceived risk immediate family friends. learned, good chunk population well, even young wild phase. decisions can't left general populations hands Depending area happen, depended size crowds. Many ones signs small go of. protests invoiced going crowded bars, churches, ""covid parties"" traced showed predicted spikes. Im scruffy sure ""waiting for"". happened happening still. Good luck. daughter 9 days ago. It‚Äôs scary shit. wife‚Äôs taking 3 months work put work home 36 weeks quarantine birth. visitors. go store every two weeks go wipe everything down. U can‚Äôt take single chance. It‚Äôs terrifying amazing blessing world so
Much love child worries bad Trump finally starting MAGA. never thought (shithole country) EU citizenship would come handy, seeing goes fled cold war political refugees, hey... Refugee squared? Correction: elected Representatives colored like Blood side equation.

The ones colored like Baby Boy's booties large owned. work people sometimes? Yes however also willing buck say ""No!"" them. read last sentence. First read ‚Äúthey masks‚Äù thought good!.... read rest ‚Äú...around necks wrists‚Äù I‚Äôm angry them! Indoor, hour, air handling, people yelling.

This perfect covid infection scenario according epidemiological studies spread korea. One sick person got half floor sick open plan air handling blowing around would governor sign that? I'm sorry Personally grandparents bit vacations. 

Multi generational housing never moved away from! Living parents lot pros. Hahahahahahahaha One fighter tested positive far UFC, sent home. Another corner man test positive, negative next day, fighter never tested positive.  thought Fauci exaggerating first projected 100K deaths :( Oh Karens Twitter freedom day simply epic 19.1% Florida elderly. Nowhere quotes say drink bleach.


I understand like Trump. There's nothing wrong that. suggesting something could ingested injected would 'clean' virus simple way saying could solution. Never bleach mentioned, except people want say ""HURR DURR Trump said inject bleach"", not. wait another 14 days get good read, hopefully match spike cases last 2 weeks. Soo...Mission Accomplished? people rear heads subtly like little pieces shit peaking ass?

Specific periods wasted effort comes vain left sound of..

ONE SINGLE PLOP Broward requires masks inside businesses people pretty compliant. much beach that‚Äôs mostly idiot tourists. Nope, true country. Many landlords, included, can't make last long without rental income. Definitely would bleed savings quickly dump non-liquid assets. Fortunately tenants remained current they're essential workers like am. speak language they‚Äôll understand... Sorry hear dude. 

But yeah, put responsibility tests 100% reliable, making product purely life-or-death.

I hope choose take 0.005% chance spread lethal disease patients going die without it. Ah.

That better, still crap study. results clear, would already know primary studies tried HQC themselves. Also cardiac incidents? order results correct would HCQ treat covid, also massively effective preventing heart attacks. ""Sir people waiting use coinstar machine...."" Florida doubling total cases every 12 days, US doubling total cases every 40 days.

For Florida (This shows 15 days, calculating last 7 days gives us 12.8 days): 

Florida 6/16: 80,101 total positive tests 
Florida 7/1: 158,989 total positive tests 

The US ton existing cases, several states climbing quickly, hence 40 day period. (this shows 51 days, calculating last 7 days gives us 40.3 days): 

US 5/11: 1,350,834 total positive tests 
US 7/1: 2,694,316 total positive tests 

We're probably measuring different things. see Florida's daily increase went 5,004 10,109 7 days apart, daily counts intermittant swing wildly make claim IMHO. tomorrow 9,000, neither us claim Florida dropping 10% day. 100 percent yes ""A small number businesses closed"". kidding me? city ghost town like 2 months. Subway ridership MASSIVELY down. perfect, hell lot many states.
Have even set foot city last 6 months? Anymore Exactly, developed. shouldn‚Äôt excuse. case, actually legitimate scientific reasons might want get vaccine soon becomes available.  vaccine developed huge rush chance mistakes could made safety issues could handwaved.

The big one I'm concerned antibody dependent enhancement, known occur coronaviruses. Basically, antibodies quite right provide immunity actually make symptoms acute deadly.

Edit: link know I'm never questioned statement, said source hot trash. Read wrote, think wrote. Let's redneck math.

20% cases asymptomatic therefore get tested, I'd add 20% total cases: 3,404,626.

131,485 deaths would 3.86% chance death. 


However, treating much better viral load going due social distancing measures. Let's assume average time death 12 days reported. Today US 687 deaths. 12 days ago 33,431 cases. Death rate would 2.05% overall. 

If everyone US infected, we'd 6.7 million deaths. Exactly. want everything reopened stay hidden away mansions. Go watch CNBC, see guests studio still video conferences. ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt affirm bias must wrong!!!‚Äù far there‚Äôs hard evidence even single one taken place‚Äîjust recurring cycle breathless, unsubstantiated media coverage. simply racism south europeans nothing else argue that's way soon.

But no. trendline shows doubling expected every 5ish days. yeah, Wednesday A) dont get ""grants"" ""funding"", reimbursed per case. case reviewed insurance. commit medicare fraud (the govt paying covid cases believe) lose access medicare...and hospital goes business, severely penalized, people perpetrating charged tons fines.

B) can't ""falsley report"" case, thats medical fraud. would even that? straight edit lab reports?

So actually mean say ""they trying report many cases possible"" ""they trying *diagnose* many cases possible"" ""they committing medical fraud""...which stupidest thing hospital do.

I guarantee happening, is, whoever putting entire business risk (in easy detect way) Hire neighborhood high school college student watch children $10-12 per hour. Day camps cost $300 per child per week. Family members fill gaps. cheap means, spend $10k said done. Lmao /s right? They‚Äôre quite real today. Key West doesnt test. Ran Dr told pretty much they‚Äôre needed Miami. Good times Well could send medical study affirming position? would interested reading expanding viewpoint. would guessed. 

The US utter embarrassment Aaaaaah fuck. purpose testing people take measures found positive virus? Nope. part [the emergency pandemic bill](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2020s/b2020s/measures/documents/summary_hb_2016_2020special) passed Kansas state legislature, counties revoke emergency orders governor. Yeah dont say loud around either. Nobody wants believe number doesnt equate 50k deaths day. doom gloom round parts, get corona face melts - exceptions! Damn, incredible fast thing grew.. Please address proper title, Party Mike.   ""We prevailed."" ‚ÄúHas anyone seen president?‚Äù  Oh, it‚Äôs ‚Äústrongly encouraged,‚Äù I‚Äôm sure everyone think decide comply. /s Given spike cases started 3.5 weeks ago given median infected age less half months ago: tell Ugh, hotels even open? State Street closed too. wouldn't. Read problem. start 1 cent double it. adding more. either ‚Äúinvestigator‚Äù ‚Äúfield agent‚Äù. I‚Äôve never heard FBI says ‚Äúinspect‚Äù 73.6 perfect statistics made up. can't give ticket because

A cop write ticket infraction (not wearing mask public), court determine guilt innocence. 

As mentioned probably going easy get Doctor's note. anyone living nation flattened curve, what's like? There‚Äôs much governor rest country hellbent killing everyone else. takes one person Texas California completely fuck everything actually watched first time couple weeks ago. Honestly think good job representing incomprehensible time us mortals. President Trump, please go nationwide this. Thank you, sir! difference means 5 years. 71 vs 53 difference typo refers median. I‚Äôm nurse, I‚Äôll never work free. Wife‚Äôs laid somebody pay bills trace wet market outbrake November 2019, find sanitation samples country june 2019, actually originated China. Maybe Wuhan would still kindling snowballed all... origin would, necessity, elsewhere. Hippie! Hmmm... sounds like kind bleeding heart progressive democracy. Next thing tell ensure everyone healthcare education too. elections two parties chance winning. probably talk sense Joe. Though doubt anything Bill Burr's roasting changed mind. Sounds like decent plan. Hopefully enough stores go effort even craziness outbreaks already been. tweet bombarded individualists complaining rights stripped bow demands.

It nice knowing you, Reddit. government citizens doomed us all. Interesting? Floridiots  (Categorically false) bad. live California that's brain defaults I'm typing. regardless though. I'm pretty sure quit due fearing COVID could... Welllllll.... Canada 100% way since COVID... USA, knows, probably honestly.. Gotta productive billionaire class, ya know? Weirdly you‚Äôre downvoted. Hmm In-house validation interface testing would take week. Hell, assembling unit laboratory would take couple days. Manufacturing one week small business? Maybe dinky thermal cycler, high throughout instrument like Cobas 6800. think read Roche makes like 10 month backlogged like 100 Non covid people die. Accident victims die. Heart attack victims die. like horrible dystopian apocalyptic zombie movie, without biting.

I afraid type last bit. 2020 read? recently Florida. Literally ones gives fuck wearing mask. It‚Äôs insane little care pandemic. Jokes - I've cut dad's hair three times I'm pretty good it. 

I ain't letting cut mine though. Pretty much. want say cruise ships Iran become thing bumped point. Feels like years ago Lol dont need too. rate infection low. like trump says ‚Äúwe‚Äôve done many test way skorea!! ‚Äú Guess what, march 12 done 2 thousand test south korea done 120 thousand already first case day!! 2 thousand vs 120 thousand. Soo since controlled contact trace dont need many test go cluster. europe. completely failed thats 7 hour lines texas cuz people want get tested symptoms Deaths still declining rapidly, despite 3.5 weeks sharp increase cases! that's known true. studies looked certain types antibodies. immune system various methods responding infection. still know sure immunity long might last. California‚Äôs 7 day moving average positive (~6%) test rate much lower states line national average Arizona 24% Texas 14.5%. NY 1% yea it‚Äôs uh ‚Äúsoo bad places like LA‚Äù compared Houston example, liberal doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs management issue. did, read actual study based on. 

It shows younger people likely recover Covid older people. it. 18 year difference age groups. Ugh this, I'm terrified test positive... I'm chef retirement community clubhouse. Florida man spends weekend numerous fun-loving Floridians congregating bars, clubs restaurants Central Florida pandemic deadly virus. 


That says all. hover lines get list ranking people admit associate face masks Islam already? It‚Äôs really obvious it‚Äôs annoying watch pretend they‚Äôre concerned ‚Äúliberty‚Äù stupid strong Denton. Mexico % positivity right now. big problem US, Mexico Brazil lot worse shape. roughly 10% higher two days ago... Corona Zone.

AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!! Actually doubled would get. Day 30 = $5,368,709.12 next day double that.  Lucha house party plus Rey official case numbers NY massively undercounted.  Testing March/April nowhere near easily available now.  

Does mean Florida, etc good job?  No.  time death count states like Florida nothing like happened northeast done much better job protecting long term care facilities. know, gonna sound bad feel terrible saying this, sometimes think virus symptoms effect virus Contagion, that‚Äôs probably time American‚Äôs unanimously take seriously. sub like panic only.

Fuck tavern league. Slobbery, touchy little fuckers suspicion they've gotten better hiding it

No doubt plays role, human beings end day, continue human things (e.g. Paige &amp; Xavier Woods sex tape immediately comes mind).

Hint: private individuals. It‚Äôs typo. 63 (54 - 74) seems fit given SDs, categories. I‚Äôm 27, thanks. Hmm Neil Ferguson? Trying math vacuum without accounting people changing behaviors seems tough. 

Also it‚Äôs probably wrong assume everyone similarly vulnerable infection - fact wouldn‚Äôt shock significant portion (type blood?) population uniquely resistant initial infection and/or severe symptoms 

Tldr I‚Äôm sure back envelope math helps much think low 7 day moving average deaths. Logically would make sense see deaths start trending here. probably gonna hit wall available testing materials. :( didn‚Äôt mean facet American culture main cause, feel like contributes mentality know? America whole still individualistic country like Japan. Remember stores empty people hoarding food?

Fire them. We've got plenty substances either, many both. Sounds reasonable, I'm sure official stats it? carrying division works caveat bit flimsy test taken one week might confirmed case another week. That‚Äôs long term education

And maybe smoke joint two weekends We're already 125,000 nowhere near herd immunity. would million deaths unreasonable? ?? rationale wearing masks church?? churches exempt closing restrictions, pure craziness me. bunch people, inside together, singing talking. super dangerous. that, Churches probably EASIEST thing online streaming, important economy slightest.

And masks, even though wearing masks church seems like super easy thing well? Wtf going on? Yes, definitely standardise everything interests one corporation. That's great idea. burger restaurants McDonalds. great 'standardised' everything.

But then, guess Bill agreement. Ya boy mid-March, knew bunch doctors nurses actively trying buy cheap vacations. government stopping cruises prevented them.

I work hospital shared story. Several hospital employees came forward talk medical staff socially distance, mask outside work, still attend parties throw parties.

Someone shared family member worked nurse mocked coming party.

Another mocked wearing mask.

I'm sure change hospitals become flooded. 

My medical staff thought brilliant, knew safe. Everyone else jerk wearing mask felt extremely confident abilities, need one. 

And, clear, medical staff also thought soon open. lot hospital staff started seeing mental health professionals reopened. Anxiety depression spiked. 

So, take virus seriously. did. extremely confident ability safe. 

They still went beaches, weekend getaways, wear masks. told safe being. They're like jerks wearing masks. knew protect themselves. 

This two employees vented before/during lockdown. 

Most hospitals routinely test staff asymptomatic infections. States require hospitals want waste tests.

I work Florida. hospital full, scrap COVID plan. divert emergencies hospitals several days. discharge admit, discharge admit. we're converting hallways patient rooms. know getting worse every day. 

I bet wear masks stay indoors. know sure. Oh yah margie  Exactly. unimportant now. like you. think died today world would care?

Overstating things like ‚Äúhospitals full‚Äù give people argument information virus incorrect/overstated lessens severity current situation minds. That's everywhere drive testing. car contained. mean??? also good news since Danish government, ""proven track record good decisions"", essentially confirms parts Sweden well enough exempt travel discouragement.

Seeing number deaths per day keeps declining, logical assume Denmark gradually open parts Sweden! Probably good idea really Ah yes, good old American selfishness ""I give fuck anybody else myself, fuck I'm changing habits, even means potentially killing people"". much think total dipshit, morons reason America crumbling enjoy watching burn say care thousands would die go.

Recently, trend Sweden infections among young. seems likely student celebrations something trend. There've quite articles lately this: Yeah public information, need tell water wet either.

You‚Äôre right cheeky reply. pretty bad though. millennial kids 2 good incomes it‚Äôs still hard get house without moving sticks. I'm sorry :(. hope soon feel better. Heck, hope thatwe reason to. Touch√©e that's exactly we're trying achieve vaccination. measures implemented eradicate virus - besides developed remote island states like New Zealand Iceland that's pretty much impossible. They've implemented allow worldwide scientific community time create vaccine treatments without suffering horrifying death toll reaching herd immunity natural way. packing beaches 1000's people vaccine putting state risk? it‚Äôs safe washing banning isn‚Äôt saving lives. hand destroying environment pollution big part people greater contact national stores infectious diseases it‚Äôs potentially saving lives ask mitigate that. That's do. ER, ICU, awful work right many feel called it. Thank god them, could never. like arguing yourself. Please, true! saying strategy varying effect depending implemented. Yes, true.

TTI would still TTI regardless implement two minutes two decades pandemic. strategy, different timings. timing implement strategy changes degree effect.

Have explained clearly now, going say thing yet another time? r 2 doctors werent wearing masks talking nonsense? Cases seem trend week though. bit early say Monday still. depends ask That's big factor cuts multiple years timeline, full story. that's would still take 5+ years vaccine.

""Warp speed"" also means combining testing phases, progressing phases previous one complete, expediting regulatory process etc. absolutely mean health risk higher, particularly participants trials vaccinated initial wave. However increased risk relatively small far outweighs potential benefits.

The NY Times excellent interactive article expected timeline: Oxford vaccine rushed per se. using research data vaccine original SARS Virus Coronavirus' far ahead. proved previous trials similar vaccines including one last year earlier coronavirus, harmless humans.

Also joint push data share happening find vaccine seeing faster progress. teams developing vaccines sharing results research efforts help teams. data share extremely beneficial also allows peers reproduce test results confirming disproving efficacy. 

I one worried getting Oxford vaccine specifically prove successful. Sorry hear grandma. Swallowing complicated. lot nerves muscles work right. people eventually lose ability. It‚Äôs like stomping gas you‚Äôre going 30 vs going 0  Well going start talking shit maskless nations. 

Do agree Norway, Austria, Switzerland

So fucking dumb. time multiple consecutive days ""cases getting worse"" already far late. means action taken weeks months ago wasn't.

My bet based data new york, ~20% infected already, ~30,000 deaths (0.16% new yorks population) land somewhere 0.5 0.7 true IFR dust settles. current estimates seem range anywhere 0.12 1.1 Agreed, hope closer end beginning pandemic. want life back! says they‚Äôre closing 13 sites order move efficient state funded testing sites. would closing 13 sites significant especially since FL isn‚Äôt even included one 5 states? She‚Äôs also grieving. Grief things person. would make wiping ass lot easier. get whole social interaction thing, actually think person school would lead *worse* outcomes front. Hear out: kids aren‚Äôt getting much social interaction now, want it. parents want it. Zoom chat FaceTime friends can‚Äôt wait till again. sad sucks. 
Now let‚Äôs imagine school. group work, group tables, touching, high fives, hugs, soccer/football/basketball. Playground probably closed, stuck room ~6 hours day. Teachers, trusted adults room, basically berate kids get close one another. say ‚Äúberate‚Äù behavior issues 100% *going* problem. Everything listed runs exactly opposite modern behavior management system. Teachers need resort old school marm style management, fear. Even teachers nice, read core guiding principle classroom. Wash hands, don‚Äôt forget mask, Purell purell purell, mandatory COVID checks, temperature checks, high absenteeism. Essentially fear outside getting inside tainted. 
The outcome, teach children fear one another. I‚Äôm child psychologist, would imagine child little lonely sad several months better training fear people. least one outcomes implies child still wants near people. That‚Äôs absolutely do. butt? 
Or high 5 main arm spin around ""down low""? necessarily. can‚Äôt make assumptions animals transmit owners. agree seems logical. need study investigate. Imo think people want know answer due implications. honestly don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs distaste social media. Every check Facebook see pics relatives. Fun! Sometimes people post political things agree with, things disagree with. it‚Äôs easy ignore disagree. It‚Äôs Twitter. giggle things scroll things. people tell it‚Äôs terrible, don‚Äôt get it, don‚Äôt understand keep using services hate much.  know easily covid19 spreads contaminated surfaces? record many people infected contaminated surfaces? even recorded cases contamination contaminated surfaces? seven (yes seven!) people Tulsa rally black sitting Cain week ago.  don‚Äôt understand shit they‚Äôre wiping ass keyboard long lung transplants last? it‚Äôs like heart think 10-20 years? virus cut years life. problem slogan every argument seems ‚ÄúGo back came from‚Äù. sounds like really bad idea.

Quite honestly, players one‚Äôs screw up. can‚Äôt see bunch guys treated like gods everywhere go content cooped resort nobody else 2 months straight. Bush warned Bin Laden planning attack nothing. obsessed preparedness let terrorists kill 5,000 people? use third arm high 5s. India says hi r/theydidthemandatemath couldve safer month two Florida couldnt wait. Sucks you‚Äôre downvoted. Obviously narrative small businesses reopening = bad. Thousands protesting = perfectly fine. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs impossible kind intellectually honest conversation here. nobody acknowledge reckless dangerous protests weeks end (with respects COVID) show mora depravity whole argument. 

Just cause - denying implications spreading virus abhorrent dishonest. Kristi noem anything either. BIG FIREWORKS MT RUSHMORE TOMORROW üéâ üôÑ  People become stupid, likely felt comfortable behaving like that, he's clearly always twat. 5% death rate covid including sick people able access medical help going kill amazing amount people next years, think I'm wrong look official amount people covid died, know numbers low too... Pretty pleased state government done. Hopefully get past 'reopen' stage without much drama. NO, need honest, know. care wanted PPE medical personnel... lie America that. tell Americans wear cloth masks, doctors get N95. warning everyone. no, people morons. made believe mutations would weakened virus. felt ""almost back 100%"" couple days. stuck state, poor energy, inability get hours focused work done day, month. widow

That's quite typo. :| know one see this, FUCK top comments bother read what's actually happening.

He utterly paralyzed/catatonic, quadriplegic significantly recovered brain damage event. 


Legal guardianship agencies, along many others serving people disabilities profit, frequently make decisions contradicting desires disabled person closest them. fight guardianship less best person disabilities maintaining long list clients bill services behalf of. 


And that's get arrogant, cruel, ableist bullshit deciding someone wheelchair whether life worth living.  


There hundreds comments passionately discussing, great depth granularity, DETAILS APPLY SITUATION. 


INTERNET, FUCK WRONG YOU? Isn't... obvious? Well protests. Look... either protests caused infections increase need stop, outside large groups spread virus, case needs stated, need open economy, enforcement requirement business takes place outside. can't say protests spread virus -- protesting -- need stay inside can't conduct business, etc. That's completely illogically.

There several states took things quite seriously, CA among them, pretty big spikes. no? people protesting last month ok celebrating fourth.  need quit worrying people's masks. mask police  fondly reminisce good things got REALLY bad. went eat last week family members live. county 38 confirmed cases 3,000 tests. That's 1% tests performed since pandemic started .1% county's population confirmed infected. ate outdoors tables spread out. I'm cautious places actually better others terms spread prevelant. Umbrella corp makes vaccine? People area went protests encouraged get tested daw days regardless symptoms include majority population world, course get majority cases world. USA! USA! USA! Personally expect second wave arrive somewhere autumn. seems might likely scenario. long can, let's enjoy summer best possible. Neither testing enough I'm sorry. Coronaviruses well truly suck truly want stab little spikes nasty pointy thing.

After husband recovered, discovered cat FIP (also coronavirus) unfortunately passed. four five members household survived coronavirus infections year. Sigh. Wow, that's sad. choose parents us, must choose destiny without them. know anything guy assuming he's well he's Broadway performer... Yeah I'm fuckin moron. wish idiots behind keyboard would shut fuck listen people far educated themselves. Fauci charged terrorism. 90% new york 65. 5000 deaths NYC (probable confirmed) 65. 20% new york infected. Thats 1 360. 45, 1 several thousand. much likely die homicide covid-19 45. 

point being, cant go one day. ... six months late USA #1, go go USA - wait...oh... I've moved closer job and/or pushed remote work multiple occasions reduce/eliminate commute, part equation definitely avoiding unnecessary time spent road.

As allude to, eliminating risk entirely impossible. mean take steps reduce risk. Well said... many levels see cases US skyrocketing, deaths seem following quite know why. guess moderate cases discovered, maybe treatments improved since March/April? Hmm... type individual states (more akin italy, since virus homogeneously infect areas), like TX OR, see pretty steep trend downward (although 90%) -- least -- sharp rise before, kinda scary. get lmao holy shit

china huge population, unreasonable think virus would spread faster. use head.

not everything race thing despite might think appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* people aged 18-45 IFR different flu. That‚Äôs fact. Bingo. first time I‚Äôm aware utter stupidity vast majority human beings, physical manifestation form sickness death. 

So we‚Äôre pretty much toast. They‚Äôre country 210 million challenging country 331 million

Just wait till India enters game 1.3 billion far concerned worried. appear catching clusters moment. Whether slow unseen increase idea. think second wave inevitable eventually though. OP said. quality really depends. 


Many factories changed make PPE gears incl. masks. 



Medical gears heavily controlled need proper paper export it. 

Many companies marked items said medical use. 
So didnt need papers. 

Countries also said factories send stuff quickly. test products on-site. 



After scammy factories making low quality PPEs. Even exporting millions masks, even 1 batch faulty. make headline news. Saying masks China good. 
Chinese government regulated export heavily headlines. whatever say is. need tested need papers get exported. 



In situation, profiteering. sad part humanity. 


So get facts right dont rely headline news. Pretty much Spain. lockdown even stricter Italy's. $600 fine leaving house without good reason. Checks done, people fined too. Actually Chy\*nese people specifically coined phrase ""‰∏ß‰∫ãÂñúÂäû/make funerals look like weddings"" refer Chy\*nese gov handle pandemic state-owned media reporting it.

We never expect Tr\*mp quick learner wedding plan every American!!!

No wonder Chy\*nese people called ""Â∑ùÂª∫ÂõΩ/China's Man Washington"", NYTimes article that.

Honestly I'm really impressed. cornerstone economy point, it, relatively open black market set large scale commerce China, official form it? people really supposed slip come back, rest family basically hostages. anyone found without close family enough context serve basis taking off. Weeks riots. Looting. protests. *But they‚Äôll tell it‚Äôs small businesses reopened soon. people found positive, mortality rate decreasing. indisputable. Still nothing taken lightly, real issue irresponsible reopening people refusing take seriosuly. E.g. masks etc. always enjoy hearing board members meeting virtually discussing teachers taking temperatures 800+ kids every morning germ-infested schools. don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll wipe desks. also interviews Chinese propaganda news Source?

Even shanghai, xi'an, tianjin, shenyang, chongqing qingdao still felt like less busy Manchester.

It really Beijing felt overwhelmed. Coincidentally, decide life's coin flip, 50/50 odds eating first 69 without encountering deadly M&amp;M.

 
Math:

Probability given M&amp;M killing (P) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99

Probability death willing take (D) = 0.50

Number M&amp;Ms eaten = x

Solving x:

P^(x) = 1- D

ln(P^(x)) = ln(1 - D)

xln(P) = ln(1 - D)

x = ln(1 - D) / ln(P) = 68.968 = 69 I'm sorry loss.

When first husband died (of stroke, years ago), relieved fast straightforward process. We'd married five months, necessary conversations yet.

My current husband survived covid conversations. Naturally, fast clearer, struggles it. (Had migraine today fact. Still average number even though I've mostly well, weak, months.) learned Florida isn‚Äôt meme vacation period barely started.

It‚Äôs going come this. 31 year old went back post secondary, I've never caught many colds life. Colleges cesspool germs. way open. mean, America paid 80% wages, plus low-wage workers (many min wage workers received UI normally would earn). Specific stores occupancy requirements mandated state (Oregon). queue distance -- six feet == two meters. Public spots closed.

Still surging now. Everyone wants deny it, protests. county opened 1 week ago (closed again), cases steady increase since gone before. think infection rate 2-4x reported honestly. that‚Äôs guessing. 

I‚Äôm sure lot people asymptomatic never got tested. Dudes still heartless prick. Probably someone yelps wearing mask protect others discounting person‚Äôs life This. China also used add 8,000-12,000

Did believe Chinese numbers then?

Only shops/restaurants see affects social distancing etc. metropolitan areas. lot appalling poverty even homelessness rural areas too, combined even far worse public services. lots prisons. generous do. seen virus completely derail friends mental health. Australia definitely gone bit quiet lately.

There's much left say. gave china middle finger world stage kinda wilted away. Put tariff on, called us 'dog' lmao.

We're going motions shaking plants parliament, terms world stage really sure else say. think made clear.

Students fine! problems chinese people. long plants agents etc. thought wrong. Oh really? gonna huge impact hundreds days people working, business shutting government give shit? real clusterfuck come two weeks later, 28th Instead tearing CDC guidelines open pushing early restart, I‚Äôm guessing Obama would encouraged mask usage social distancing told governors open actually reached 2 weeks declining infections. may even tried figure mechanism shutdown advocated lot government support small businesses, landlords, unemployed, worked congress produce robust accountable relief package. probably wouldn‚Äôt pressuring people keep reported numbers low, slowing testing. I‚Äôm guessing Obama would worked congress get really widespread testing available early national scale. Hell, Obama President, he‚Äôd pandemic task force ready go gamed playbook air transmitted coronavirus, since SARS MERS happened presidency. may directed CDC start handling Covid still Wuhan, kind like SARS, MERS, Ebola. 

Sure, governors might reckless open early, possibly people would maskless, really think we‚Äôd look like Italy way now. get 400k. New York scale outbreak gets TX 42k dead. Even 5x bad that's way 400k significance positive test rate, important it‚Äôs low? thing think hints increased testing capacity. ceiling fan, makes spin. *8 picturing someone swimming murky water bunch alligators go like see crocodiles Africa. giant Burmese python picking off. tbh, Hausarzt needs nice refer order test. refuse get cars? car accidents? live bubble? Or, like trying wipe ass hula hoop. hope agony American ends soon. like car rentals? seem get fine age limit. stop testing! Without testing numbers would low!

Genius! world genius!  motherland... Netherlands... Unfortunately linear function case numbers huge means case numbers remain huge, grow. Masks great preventing outbreaks, enough bring case numbers down. Awww! love Rocky Point! love even Mexico shutting *us* out! didn‚Äôt mean include original context said. directed implied question asked. valid question. 

I‚Äôm help people obviously need help relieving obvious anxiety disorders. Eh, positivity rate would much higher. test that's waste resources. heard post-viral syndrome? ten percent get lasts months. 

Where's data? Mask not, he‚Äôs white tables closed went started eating - wasn‚Äôt open wasn‚Äôt wearing mask. stop pee. condolences :( God help people... please... once.

Sweden winning What? really interesting. never heard model before. Thanks sharing.

In results, Australia &amp; USA score incredibly similarly... two cultures similar significant difference captured model. Australia‚Äôs pacifist nature wasn‚Äôt included uncertain/avoidant scale? don‚Äôt like ruffle feathers. Dogs. Elephants. Looks like animals infected demon disease... sad. provide detail point ? Thats ive told non-scientists, like President. news, water wet. goofygoober2006, people forced take vaccine truly public health crisis fast-track court appeals subject.

I'm wary mandating people put X bodies one case reference coronavirus, i.e. CoVid-19-SARS? seems reasonable 'force take vaccine' unless actual medical reason cannot take it. sincerely hope sanity comes reconsider that, especially light current outbreaks Texas. Good luck you, please stay safe! essentially person's blog.

""We print truth.... handle it?"" That's hilarious. Careful all, might cut website. two exceptions? Fucking dumb. many states put mask restrictions place exponential growth already caused problem instead could actually make difference. governor (Illinois) gotten lot flack, vote him, give lot credit getting things back rights. 200000% anecdotal hence probably useless info every time gotten sick flu/cold couple days poor sleep. ""Under Pressure"" goes *ding ding ding da-da-ding ding, ding ding ding da-da-ding ding*. ""Ice Ice Baby"" goes *ding ding ding da-da-ding ding, *dah-ding ding ding da da ding ding*. Totally different. Swedish small scale research found every 1 person antibodies 2 cells would cause immunity

This gross misinterpretation data presented paper. ‚Äúmore people cells antibodies‚Äù part came testing healthy donors, people confirmed infections. 

Nearly people confirmed infections produced antibodies cells. random people population probably cross reactive cells, may may beneficial them. pratice preach Jogo Bonito virus Thank you! 2mikeupsidedown

Nah twitters shitter. promotes zero discussion, ranting yelling. compared old BBS forums abysmal way communicate. bothered it? Theres misinformation lol Nice cover. Yup, there's clear answer here. million variables play, young people need stop thinking zero chance ending severely sick. Even flu kill young, healthy person; lower less common rate COVID19.

One damaging bits information propagated early young people risk. less likely suffer severe outcomes, absolutely end ICU vent severe complications (viral myocarditis). It‚Äôs thing every state went through. Instead taking success/fewer anticipated deaths result lockdowns, etc., lots people took ‚Äúthe virus isn‚Äôt big deal.‚Äù Neat Americans smart used think. Literally way every country done it. Protecting essential workers shields dividers, skeleton staff, curbside grocery pickup masks. Nice cover. Deaths lagging, test positivity rate increasing, simple maths. 1000 tests 100 positives 10% positivity rate. 10000 tests 2000 positives 20% positivity rate. increased testing overall virus spreading!   gf saying like person's genetics make certain people predisposed severe illness this. telling guy day family gets goes bad, hide out. many people willing take risk.  say we'll exposed end.  say, longer delay, medical people know. give chance.  new. pretty sure whole state VA this. saw somewhere developing vaccine COVID came light. even make sense? in: water wet happened March, they'd infected February. hardly case arsehole taking seriously. Hardly anybody took seriously back then, including media. fact subreddits still full people calling us doomers even suggesting end pandemic. 

So actually educate situation instead heartless dickhead towards dead warnings family one first struck. cost according study 3rd dimension pile bodies 4th growth pile, like world war z, Americans get wall Mexico. Trump 2020! Keep fantasies please. Yea can‚Äôt even imagine families going right now. strong. Anyone ability read write KNOW COVID-19 much deadlier flu. even survive it, body basically fucked. USA USA! realistic scenario. 

....kind like US refused elect one guy actually gave fuck people ...twice. Time bust sharks laser beams heads blame x-ray broken bone.

Social media exposed horrible disease we've country very, long time. disease inevitable result bad policy. Natural selection take care that. one long-term play true percent positive going down, absolutely isn't. listening Pieter Piot, co-discoverer Wnola vaccine highly respected virologist webinar yesterday. said currently enough glass vaccine vials world accomodate mass vax programme needed event vax effective October ... sobering. That‚Äôs thing, didn‚Äôt start scratch. true sort sad. It‚Äôs amazing many people going vacation virus hotspots right now. coworker gone beaches Florida week TWICE already summer. boss considered high risk husband well. doesn‚Äôt seem care could get somebody killed. deaths rise couple weeks. People got lot money that. increased unemployment. money important saving lives good luck Florida. issue can't kick kids onto street need families go to, finding people willing adopt difficult enough without also deal language barrier. point I'd say Spain wants back, it. Lol. concert gone ahead, also would worst thing 2020. There's law says can't wear mask gloves. Stay safe. Social media platform. real problem people stupid, foresight, thoughtful kind n r often preachers anti intellectual ideas. sensationalist/clickbait headline

The US bought Remdesivir, Gilead, company makes it, gave green light generic manufactures make countries without royalty payments. anything, US one getting screwed we're paying full retail price countries get manufacture cost pennies get personalized adds! could live without knowing buy? No. Birth defects due Thalidomide result clinical trial, product licenced prescribed. Thalidomide actually precipitated lot current clinical trial design precautions use. Trump motivation lie re-election. think WHO's motivation lie would be? fear? Cuz idiots didnt read Reddiquette says downvote stuff belong. bury (silence) opinions dont agree with. someone provide link support group help get this? think got mixed think so. We've heard many times, time relaxed restrictions... nothing ever happened so... possible suddenly lost ability swallow, feel like likely fact family visitors. aunt feeding literally everyday mother made regular visits always helped meals aswell. 

Her situation awful though. advanced stage years ago told us wanted die. think would peace passing, think anyone predicted would current circumstances y'know? symptomatic ones ones already it, we're looking antibody dependent enhancement... tell what. go call cop asshole, see happens. Another reason people want kids go back school (including American Academy Pediatrics) disastrous effect online learning kids' education. work special education (speech pathology) seen effects first hand. kids fine remote learning, shit show. Many kids state live rural areas, bad internet connections. Kids essential workers even parents working home always able get needed support signing attending meetings. kids chaotic situations, lots kids household, stressed parents, borderline neglectful parents, outright abusive parents, kids really intensive needs CANNOT focus computer screen. kids getting seen special ed services every day school ended attending zero sessions schools closed. kids already behind peers, puts even farther behind. 

And special ed/intensive needs. general ed teachers worked spring said thing. kids great, maybe half work would normally school, participated Zoom sessions turned zero work, dropped face earth. know safety concerns, impact months school devastating, despite possible danger I'm praying schools person least kids. I'm usually pro-lockdown, mask wearing, etc, kids see, long-term effects school closure worth it, I'm fine attending school person long masks social distancing properly implemented. theory is: universal health care eventually coming usa might well eliminate people 1st introducing it. ... makes sense think it. karma offer solution well huge medical bills Yes, people age get seriously ill, outlier. But, 99.5 % survival rate also includes people like - still alive, crippled forever. minority, course, something think about. I've found driving away city trails maintained walkable. Nobody glorious. poison ivy yet. *knock wood*

I same-ish reaction 2008 economy operated. big why? worth it? for? time, resonating lot people maybe system fukt. benefits running totalitarian dictatorship. Namely, Nationwide outbreak, relatively easy lock stamp out. That's March 30th article, testing absolute disaster. 

Below April - June data Texas tests widely available using completed case reports, pretty convert demographic testing/death numbers percentages (# dead / # tested positive) get following chart

Age Group | Cases | Deaths | Fatality Rate
--|--|--|--
&lt;1 Year| 85 | 0 | 0.0%
1 - 9 years | 344 | 0 | 0.0%
10 - 19 years | 941 | 0 | 0.0%

80+ years | 1049 | 265 | 25.3%

In actuality rate probably much smaller younger populations due large number asymptomatic/mild symptoms, can't establish precision get solid antibody testing. got $770 million bonus, cutting Tesla staff raises salaries. Houston judge Hidalgo issued mask order months ago. Governor Abbott says can‚Äôt can‚Äôt enforce it. rescind order. happens? Virus spreads even worse. Abbott finally says ok let‚Äôs issue order ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
Someone really tip wheelchair over. Lt Governor isn‚Äôt better. know, man said grandparents like ok risking death keep economy churning. Wtf?? Makes us Texans look bad. someone/something stop shit like headline. wrong lol pretty fucking pompous... see people shitting Dr. Birx pooled testing. plenty legit reasons shit Dr. Birx.

We pooled testing long time ago. Bill gates correct. profit willful spread dangerous mis information held criminally liable . 
Obscene profits deliberately configuring manipulate human behaviors ad clicks. 
Shameful. pretty big difference full ICU ""pretty damn close full"" ICU. 

Meaning say ICUs full 

There full close full. least, call 65% peak ICU capacity Netherlands ""almost full"". Nice! Well specifically states ""Nationality: Asian""... see much this. People complaining gyms closed committed crafting excuses avoid going decades. 

Those built habit switched home/alternative gym back March/April matter helps. helps. projects lowering deaths next weeks (daily deaths chart). seems unlikely. reading wrong? Always forever. NW Indiana well. I'm convinced county totally lying ass comes COVID deaths. 50+ people one assisted living facility tested positive, 8 counted deaths since thing began. Perhaps cynical, know local government well enough know could easily cover true counts make things look better order get everything reopened; they're buddies happily cover needed never challenge eachother, certainly publicly. like they've released 2020 mortality data, public could hold accountable this. paper mask $1 every cheap corner liquor C store. wouldn‚Äôt sweat people able get masks. countries lost almost nothing compared US per capita, actually lockdown without protests rallies, fact back normal life. might wonder USA back normal yet. pandemic people care about. think using disposable cups little ok. Let‚Äôs focus saving lives please. looks like FIFA Yeah, think people making masks plastic bags. would explain they‚Äôre breathing much CO2. turn might explain stupid nonsense they‚Äôre spouting. Alex Jones gonna maaaad üòÇ need clarify: R factor needs considered. shows happened past. 
The goal sure keep R-value low possible order keep cases down. cases traceable R critical. it‚Äôs jumping lot lower cases. 
For example outbreak 1.500+ cases week. R around 2.95 while. went 0.9 shortly afterwards general population behaving responsibly. Everyone shits posts triple peer reviewed journal worthy report, get 4 paragraph 'article' local news site link actual source SOUND ALARM. finding report literally NEED RESEARCH. seems 50% country struggling this, like last time heard hospital capacity Montana, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, North Dakota, pretty much anywhere except 5 10 states obviously don‚Äôt understand situation least bored lockdown lives already boring.  Ohio end shitshow I'm afraid. many stubborn people here, science deniers, DeWine caved Dr. Acton gone. good. geography education America bit like pandemic response: non-existent fuck deal this? really know could possibly work medical field drive home watching fools party bars government intervention day day. Maybe worn already talk wife refuses give hope. It‚Äôs sad situation all-around. Florida 64 COVID deaths yesterday. Probably 100 traffic fatalities. Chill casket coupons, geez. visit local mall yesterday actually pleasantly surprised many people wearing masks. course still significant portion wearing them, nose wearing chin strap still certainly catching lot rightly so. still far late we'll see stems tide couple weeks shit show ahead us.

I also noticed available ICU beds stste gone hovering 1400 last couple weeks 1000 yesterday, really starting hit hospitals hard feel number dropping rapidly unless expand capacity quickly. ""Twitter reacts""

Well changes everything! Twitter never that! caretaker elderly folks dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs it‚Äôs probably true problems swallowing, unless reasons don‚Äôt believe staff. It‚Äôs also true people good days bad days completely different people different times even someone seems fine visit, it‚Äôs likely many times struggling. 

Sorry hear grandma wanted maybe settle mind one point mentioned. Depends many. Low enough smart people getting vaccinated protect them. communicated people middle europe early masks mandated, quickly tamped number infections. Finnish ancestry, read Helsinki Times English line every week. seems though Finland done well, hope continues send children back school. yet live. live state Maine, numbers relatively stable, tourist season governor limiting travel people certain states whose numbers also stable. 'll see works. state badly hurt financially, tourism, fishing industry main sources income. lot ""sisu"" needed get this. confused vaccine candidate. tested US already passed Phase 1 safety testing. Hey man, survival fitness. March jump wasn‚Äôt good

The funny thing felt stupid buying many masks. like cases city started buying them. regret getting every single one also get see holiday photos, balances really. play black, transgender wheelchair user? 
(backs slowly) added number, comment come every report. missing part 2 likely 85 dying terminal cancer. think Minnie would disagree. Even can, stupid people would just... know.. Someone‚Äôs seen Michigan news reporting shingles thing? verge holiday weekend. Make break time. #1 always best outcome. Dr. Birx said briefings things like UV light. Look heallight AYTU bioscience. Pretty cool. Seriously doubt talking bleach, media hype large companies CYA reinforced stupidity. bet lot fucking know cow is. Much less seen one. riot police? 
Where maks enforcement crew?
/s  fuck wants go vanilla ice concert begin with? one catchy song like 30 years ago relevant music since. live near beach see town plates. Mainly north plates. I‚Äôm speechless. Like you‚Äôre going bring back you. different pretty face previous administration, pretty face drone struck hospitals. Right clear, ensuring public safety fucking pandemic shouldn‚Äôt political.

There similar sentiment 9/11 ceded bunch rights Patriot act rushed neverending war. 

Everything political like not. ask government seize power, get back. said atypical neumonia probable covid treated COVID afte Influenza season, expected end march. remember Gatell saying this, I'm defending him, don0t get wrong, remember saying it. Mike Judge insightful. could watch movie one time depressing, made cry.

The problem America ignorance correct procedures, intentional negligence best-practices, sake bottom line.
How punish Corporations Government? create Human Slaves tortured Machine. Seems story incomplete without including things like contagious whether asymptomatic not, hospitalization rates costs etc. contagiousness key dimension virus thought. Would good complete picture. I'm going die dystopia apocalyptic pandemic, I'd still prefer biting.

 . . . although maybe gun-toting demographic would take seriously biting. shocked one. mean kids safe guess look way. everybody spread thats danger. Birx told Floridians get tested knew looking pump cases order usher shutdown part deux lol dead cat  You‚Äôre right. would take people. Hospitals even allowed ask contact tracing questions protests. require masks indoor areas closed exactly issue? different thousands protestors gathering outside? That's assuming assign cause death properly. That's given everywhere (starting US, mind you...) Well Trump say ""America First"" congrats? Sounds right. I'm MI, apparently either means live burned-down shack Detroit, tap water full lead, I'm, again, backwoods hick. plenty great, forward-thinking people ""flyover states"", plenty backwards idiots New York LA, people get nuance, guess. areas, grocery stores charge less money people bring grocery bags (well, least stores coronavirus came visit). Maybe businesses could charge people less people wearing masks. ""One thing I‚Äôve heard news people saying people die flu COVID. think that, reality that‚Äôs true, flu season don‚Äôt need 56-foot storage unit, I‚Äôm four services day, I‚Äôm meeting total numbers year six months. doesn‚Äôt happen flu season. ¬†This COVID-19 virus new serious, it‚Äôs deadly"" grounds removal? Non-covid deaths gone people would died got cause listed covid. Please show mentioned deaths increasing dipshit. Oh, can't? another right wing loser make shit rather arguing point. expecting bad news? I'm upset that. want that, that's prerogative. think gives right dictate others live lives? already one highest infection rates, what‚Äôs point restricting travelers elsewhere? They‚Äôre less likely are. coronavirus permanent lung damage rate people 45, however... problem America ignorance correct procedures, intentional negligence best-practices, sake bottom line.
How punish Corporations Government? create Human Slaves tortured Machine. Clap hands? Please. taking dump 2 months administration thought Ted Cruz would've better presidente. I've caught recently thinking Bush would better man job... without Cheney, Cheney presidente. 4tH jUly YEt True statement we're talking policy. we're talking Traitorous behavior New York style Gangsterism. pseudo-lockdown

That disastrous decision. half-assed quarantine ineffective. Worse, gives impression quarantines work, giving plenty argumentative ammo argue lock-downs. Honestly bit messed think big deal even though killed parents Much less 1% also close zero closer reality. short, he‚Äôs saying experts got wrong (again) lockdown response virus governments was, is, unwarranted. Yea really don‚Äôt know. Antibodies aren‚Äôt thing lead immunity though. Imagine reaction cop fining protestor wearing mask anti-cop protest. What? Doctors human beings like anybody else. say someone grew family full doctors, friends lot doctors. Trust me: basically alignment breakdown segment humanity. people trouble reality F too. tired. Average USA citizen politician knows relatively little relatively little allegiance towards France.  

 Canada Australia UK Queen money, therefore maybe logic would dictate concerned high covid19 rates UK USA, know?

&amp;#x200B;

""The contemporary political relationship underpinned robust bilateral dialogue head-of-government, ministerial senior officials level. [Commonwealth two countries share monarch, Queen [Elizabeth active members within [Commonwealth 2006, British Prime Minister [Tony became first British head government address Australian Parliament. 

Australia maintains [High Commission United Kingdom, turn, maintains High Commission Lol. Places hard-core cleaning surfaces. kid tests positive ""clean school"" like still know nothing virus. 

Then mention would like kids wear masks, good luck that, maybe works 3 hours lucky. Americans, right?  country currently running concentration camps citizens*

All according US, also recent history claimed WMDs Iraq, babies thrown incubators Iraq, Saddam throwing people woodchippers. called atrocity propaganda. This. right things still got blasted, due lot factors, least populous state. folks listen, care, even us feeling pandemic fatigue right now. Really, even trying everything right, lot try manage many us once. Come Fredericksburg sometime then. We‚Äôre open tourists sidewalks much maskless people masks.  Toilet paper wars commence soon. Make Costco runs asap. Good news like get voted oblivion sub. People interested information confirms belief everyone die coronavirus. world continue around sit home posting voting bad news. Oh man hurts feelings. bad c* ck blocked automod could call would sad. Wait could also refer type frightened animal highlight cowardice lack masculinity? Maybe even question sexual prowess whether enough money got right way? old boring.  Boomers retarded FCS teacher distresses greatly.  Hawaii also 14 day quarantine period effect. self-regulated, probably followed lot visitors, that's plan.

Since still ironing re-opening plans think final yet testing visitation may part process. It‚Äôs like RuneScape :0 Feel like bit late... think right mentality, framing terms two equal sides already fooled. fact division country highly asymmetrical. Agreed, seems take stance ‚Äúbecause way 100% prove happened, didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù Didn‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre open. da fuq open? credit Obama looking much better nowadaya someone could warned us potential severity virus... funny, even entertaining. Like C-span level dull. Let's optimistic say 5 months. make place better November. well said! teachers paid parents (tax payers). can't job person, need quit. Also children, face shields better masks. see face, talk easier breathe. Time flush Florida away schools open fall total shitshow. 

If schools open fall total shitshow. Imagine upset people want work earn living. 

Take midol sweetie They‚Äôre hiding cases like there‚Äôs tomorrow interesting in-depth presentation. Huh? Washington Examiner.

Oooookay. covid, would start making plans summer January. Summer camps fill fast. Theres one operated rec center daughter swim team. filled January 15th. Worst case scenario daycare center takes kids age 12. Im lucky working home last 2 years, problem anymore. Disclaimer - I'm really one use terms like this, god damn fitting. 

Goalposting basically setting rule opinion fact, changing stances rule proven wrong, repeating process. Example - Covid even serious, there's 100 infected town. *infections hit 100* covid serious, death count even serious! *Death count rises ICUS overloaded* bunch fake news made scare us!
Essentially, never admitting wrong always new excuse. Yeah. thing got way control think bad, wait becomes apparent even vaccine can't stop US infections people wear masks also take vaccine.

And even 100k cases day, it'll still take 5 years reach 50% US population, even fabled ""herd immunity"" real going use.

Unless there's enforced nation-wide lockdown, empire over. given highest honor possible  embarrass yourself. Seriously. I'm 100% protests Black Lives Matter, people claim protests spread virus turn around pressure mayor Miami close beach grotesque hypocrisy movement favors all. matter fact, people go church die! saying may gotten it? nyc traveling la?
Jesus wicked. must 70% wearing masks. /s Okay good. thinking sounds incredibly sound. Happy anniversary! opposite. live route take get there. He‚Äôs far often. key me: someone makes high risk choice expose themselves, it.

But people infect along way makes choice wrong selfish. Families, hospital workers, public transportation drivers, colleagues, friends, teachers, on. particularly contagious virus.

That taking hospital bed resources. wrong. No, testing high reported numbers worse thought previously. 30k less tests reported, meaning true numbers 12% 7.5% previously reported order reopen. It‚Äôs absolute shitshow. Scary think. Especially since NY much dense FL. It‚Äôll ugly Seriously, what's guy's problem? Like much ask stay six feet away people? run president, VP. one thing need do, control covid19.  Scary I‚Äôm seeing lot OANN name drops. pure propaganda machine backed Trump. Terrifying many fucking idiots deep threat bs. Official english translation:

Right USA, doctors may soon make choice witch patient live one die hospital overloaded won‚Äôt able work every one. Y'all Queda suddenly good head coverings?

you: ACCEPT INSTALL DAMNIT ! Wait, feel like stupid cautious vaccine.

Let's hold train moment. I'm extremely pro-vaccine, also STEM background, going take bit convincing lot widespread support medical professionals believe totally cool safe vaccine rolled absolutely baffling short amount time. 

In fact, personally expect see lot not-stupid people saying rushed careless. course open mind hopeful anyone, let's stop putting people (reasonably) concerned rushed vaccine anti-vaxxers. environmentalism also framed spiritual issue too. given Earth God could lot better taking care it. doctor? Arizona mask man day nobody fucking complying stupid idiot trumps science. ‚ÄúWe monitoring data closely,‚Äù said, according Fox 11. ‚ÄúThere evidence yet protests led wide circulation, although Dr. Ferrer speculated , didn‚Äôt see conclusive evidence there. ‚Äù

Fox News really interested this. wonder why. Let's it. want one. Italy great example proves point specifically.

They went something like dozen lockdown measures settling people trusted go outside socially distanced way.

Once Italy political lockdown degree necessary, able contain virus.

You cannot lockdown. lockdown enough stop virus stay lockdown virus dies community new hosts.

This contain outbreak. Even nursing homes. Yeah that‚Äôs do. Especially COVID, since it‚Äôs *that* lethal.

Instead spread disease people can‚Äôt vaccinated *they die*.

Stop saying bullshit meme anti-vaxxers killing selves, validate views ever get sick recover it.

Third, changing story shit like catastrophically damaging public trust. Much like experts first said mask said mask. happened public confidence politics infected issue. 

Garcetti really shown may good management skills poor leader. Good thing stayed presidential race. TX resident - one legislature dumber Lt.

What starting conclusion looking evidence support it. countries *mumble mumble nursing home* factor searching ones uncontrolled outbreaks, whether happened little warning bad policy decisions.

Anti-vaxx types sometimes (not always) accommodated US level herd protection risk low. ""rights"". reinforce false belief ""right"", government want exposed corrupt, concerns valid. 

Bacterial infections, like TB, generally medications permanently rid body infection. Viruses, successfully prevented treated. make vaccine 50% effective low risk, might given choice take it. vaccine 95% effective low risk, government likely allow anti-vaxxers decline limited supplies prioritized health care workers, others. point, number people adequate immunity, risk general public, ability treat COVID-19 taken consideration decide force public take vaccine. save economy, save wealthy. worked, dow around 26,000 rich richer ever. 

When said save economy think talking anyone like you? well matter all. Work places cant force issue would liable rushed vaccine dangerous.  Dont downplay dangerous rushed vaccine actually be. isnt anti vax issue vaccine experts warned us rushed vaccines make virus deadly due rushed testing period honest, don‚Äôt even care why, long means masks.

which education free Cases trending downwards rather either holding steady increasing. can't know since testing capacity seems reached holds steady 11-13%. 

It true deaths hospitalizations coming cause rejoicing, quite likely new infections primarily among younger people thankfully tend get sick cases. position afford (financially mentally) lockdown several years, consider lucky.

The virus peaked NYC New Jersey mid MARCH. (Yes that's right. MARCH)

 time places like enacted policies virus already declining. I've seen data Pfizer phase 1/2 study using article. shows higher igg neutralizing antibody day 28 35. relatively recent nature paper shows antibodies covid19 go away 1-3 months asymptomatic individuals makes 80% cases. Also mrna vaccine much overall success genomic vaccines past. I'm hoping titers hold past 3 months, I'm optimistic Interesting.. wonder is? Well people notoriously bad knowing picked bug terrible. really hate much burden pandemic put elders. One thing help lot call often possible, preferably using video calling service. elders think makes HUGE difference quality life. face face, ofc miss hugs hand holding etc, better nothing! admit, there's idiots every state union think virus big deal ignore social distancing guidelines. think, however, number people largely dependent leadership state... Leaders listen science popular effective influencing population right thing.

I'm MD everyone respects governor, even always agree policy. also best hospitals medical universities country - John Hopkins University one example. Marylanders tend take pride trust institutions; listen science. such, we've managed continue see declining numbers despite reopened economy.

The real question becomes states like mine effected states manage pandemic well have. possible - maybe even probable - outbreak one state spread neighbors. far, Maryland's neighboring states, including DC, done fair good job managing pandemic, there's guarantee continue so. amazes too. least one political committee made sold masks guy it, major universities making them, hell person could write message want them. personally i'd go rainbow mask says ""i'm wearing get fined"" (points seahawks fans get this) think that. reinforces ""stupid idea bubble"" people stupid ideas reinforced think they're right that.

Yeah, there's quite bit written suggesting kids rarely get all, get it, rarely get sick, almost never give anyone. something we'd dearly love believe, since would mean could reopen elementary schools without asking kids anything except refrain pulling teachers' masks.

As anything really, really want believe, needs checked extra hard. article states fact children drive spread disease, claims demonstrate *is* possible spread degree. Unfortunately give useful guidance public policy, needs know ""how much risk reopen schools?"" accept premise reject conclusion. State Federal government longer want pay people stay home. still needs masks going out, doubt that. Pence Dense US simply stopped giving fuck. final straw matter. consequences letting lot people die? Nothing. one getting fired punished lack leadership shitty governance. Fed punished simply destroying budget decade. Congress punished insider trading. Trump punished emoluments. 

Look getting fucked working. That's what's happening. punished essential. anyone care except you? Nope. That's American gets.

We post consequences stage anyone 95%. K looks like enter absolute consequences everyone it. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Makes sense. make assessing virus trajectory bit harder we‚Äôre looking week old data though. That‚Äôs going work point pneumonia deaths going get high critical mass people going stop ask ‚Äúwait, what‚Äôs going here‚Äù? Yeah... cases still soaring across US? Austria (plus countries mentioned) situation much better?

Also, aren‚Äôt sniffles. virus cause multiple organ failure even permanent lung brain damage. It‚Äôs joke. 

I link sources need them. know. Probably new cases going worldwide (no, US!), deaths remained largely stagnant. Maybe sign COVID becoming endemic! Says guy hitting reply button. stupid people need ""vaccine""...because understand true health / know take care themselves.

Also, enough room express thoughts accurately, Twitter example, escalates quickly.

Stop, arent cool. know, rational world, lowering death rate would something celebrate I've seen lot reasons breast feed toddlers, never good one to. Care share? approve? data state (Oregon) seem indicate substantially cases per capita cities protests.

In fact, even total numbers yesterday county highest totals rural.

All indications thing spreading community contact particular masks worn. Flock immunity call Sweden apparently :P Tegnell actually says article believes second wave fall, Sweden good chance keeping infection levels low ta second wave hit. say Tegnell expects ‚Äúbig‚Äù second wave. Yeah, president Trump discovered tried help world ""experts"" fought back miracle cure: drink bleaching condition severe wearing mask kill you, stay fuck home. Thats disability for. People do, reason.

The big wigs company want us back office corporate let send us Ohio 2 weeks straight declining curve.

They keep bumping come back date two weeks every week. Like expect corona disappear. bet lots people think reason. guarantee even vaccine out, we'll see legislation government subsidizes cost. Canada closed border USA back early MARCH stayed closed ever since. closed 4 months Canada DEFINITELY open border USA anytime soon. world Mexico thinking?!?!? No. force indefinite quarantine get - safety others. tactic specifically upheld courts. Nope - times I've gotten together friends discuss things, we've met outside. 

Go place, paranoid high risk, strip shower first get in, keep old clothes baggy, start fresh.


I even wear mask meeting outside, unless plan hugging eachother dancing something. vector spread outside extremely low. Sensitization general risk vaccine development. flu vaccines entirely effective exactly that, entirely effective. flu vaccines tend sampling flu strains vaccinate against, based projections strains prevalent season. Immunization similar, entirely identical, strain also help immune system ramp flu exposed well.

They generally produce flu vaccines sensitize, since would catastrophic failure process. Memory, attention executive functioning deficits turn covid victims lockdown victims make top-notch anti-lockdown propaganda three simple steps-

1. test, underreport covid deaths labelling ""pneumonia"" deaths
2. time, make article excess deaths officially labelled covid deaths (such said ""pneumonia"" deaths) touted ""due causes covid""
3. dumbfucks spread idea above-mentioned excess deaths ""due causes covid"" actually caused hardships lockdown. So, [G-23 Paxilon then? ;) course going pop ""next week"" spike.

NY 875 cases yesterday, 1.25% cases positive. Hey guys least open borders evictions start rolling refugee crisis requires asylum, please? seen residents flee NY , Mass apts worked texas around March April , left back...and boy ruthless drive crazy af really. Using America shorthand United States America akin saying Britain (which article did, everyone accepts refers Great Britain). 

My point also article used wrong term, used 3 different terms article. happens pandemic. Give break. Holy shit dense kumquat. coming. Scientists world working restore society soon possible.

At beginning everything would get overwhelmed seeing stories vaccine may come 3-5 years. nearly every team working confident we'll one end year.

The 2 I'm following closely one Moderna one US.

Oxford's latest they'll 400 million 2 billion doses ready disperse end 2020.

Moderna took hit launch Stage 3 time, they're claiming ready Election Day US (first Tuesday November). University South Carolina student - would decimate financials University. need football. There's way around it. going push hard play fall. 

I feel football happen level fall. time stop lying herd immunity Swedish strategy cone microchips everybody? /s Okay, go use whatever want, then. 

It's kind weird keep saying different ideas ""dumb"" ""normal person"" like you. Like can't conversation someone disagrees without getting defensive calling names trying make feel bad something? different opinion search engines? 

Sure, I'm dumb, pleases you. Whatever. tickets cheap price right, rly bored rn lets go He's waging biological warfare US citizens. Yep we‚Äôre getting rid people might well ones still believing fairies Based hospitalization rates vs April states getting nailed this, kinda don‚Äôt think case. get point, testing April March 100% would shown ***lot*** cases books, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever worse right now. 

The states opened first screwing around 2 months little restrictions place. covid first got locked within 2-3 weeks *still* got hammered. States playing fire they‚Äôre get ICU level burns, unfortunately beds already filled Ehh skiing seasons going hard pass No? Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Oh that's heartbreaking hear. Hopefully soon, sounds like best do. natural Petri dishes bacteria. Okay sound rude. expect administered people. know what, American pandemic scientist critical Sweden justified despite country's performance handling it.

The problem US Trump ignored scientists went ahead w agenda, especially regarding economy. problem Sweden ignored scientists rather wrong ones leading public health response. fact idiot epidemiologist Tegnell calling shots totally different dynamic Trump ignoring Fauci. 

Totally different problems here.. Tesla workers, please unionize  One disturbing inconsistencies see kept feeding us lines ""just"" older people preexisting conditions going problems., every time turn around see another story person 50 dead virus. contradicts narrative- can't help think ""not scare working age people.""  think people need stop think- really want get thing.---especially young! know long term, seems lifelong effects lot people.  wealthy countries world impose draconian lockdowns implode economies ""sniffles."" Obviously we're here, need think yourself, prioritize life health. Sure, may need go work, need go eat things like people carelessly doing. know several people cancelling plans go Florida vacation right now. Disney reopens, I'm sure shortage visitors. get this. would think convoluted that. son chose started playing Splatoon together. Actually Virginia. don‚Äôt know whether laugh cry fact politicians think COVID-19 political adversary. every day, dragged store work. unmasked, sneezing, hollering, touching everything. Hundreds every day. [""We believe NY past peak descending side mountain,"" Cuomo tweeted. ""The continuation positive trend depends actions."" Cuomo also said infection rate New York slowed, every 10 infected people transmitting virus another 9. Today state reported 478 COVID-19 deaths, first daily tally deaths 500 since Apr 2, New York Times Fuck guy little late. virus wins. No. That's makes Oxford one neat. modified Chimpanzee Adenovirus novel humans. full name Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford #1 ChAdOx1. Noone's immune system seen virus ChAdOx1 platform based unless spend lot time interacting wild chimpanzees. CanSino Biologics Ad5 platform apparently already humans. lot people may immune system attack memory Ad5 vaccine proteins based Ad5 forget SARS-CoV-2 proteins grafted react much compared base virus.
So effectiveness Ad5 expected lower ChAdOx1 one. tried something went wrong, kept lightly hitting ""undo"" still looked worse worse. *But constitution!!!*

/s said they‚Äôve controlled first way back January, they‚Äôve lied. Things won‚Äôt change one positivity rate compared positivity rate NY/NJ back April?  often 50%.  Keep shifting goalposts. Without rule, /r/coronavirus would unbearable cesspool, filled Americans want talk small leader's pp *muscles oh didnt know that.  would still want second wave vaccines though. never truly vaccine covid-19. mean vaccine testing necessary? Houston, local leaders tried put place stay home orders mask mandates. governor rolled said nope I'm overriding everything do, opening back up, masks mandatory. kept opening state back even though uptick cases. told us would okay ""we plenty beds."" last week Monday. Friday done complete 180 ordered bars close. mask mandate go effect another 2 hours. Imagine people infected right yet show symptoms. disaster. ok..well terms greed, shares Pfizer , selfish reasons, hope works good! paying attention what's going then. That's nuts. Philadelphia mask leave homes go business. Stores capped fraction capacity outdoor dining us allowed 10 feet space. 

I hope gets better 10% positive ratio. WHO's statement based previous weeks/months. Quit anti-vaxxers!

/s sad see legend sport go like this. heart goes nurmagomedov family already public....look rules page, click mod action, mentioned ""rushed"", yet consensus among experts safe? hope find one soon, taking first rounds it????? think data obvious. people Texas New York. Unlike Ron Desantis, pure Tucker Carlson evil incarnate, actually believe Abbott decently human. shown false 150 years experience compulsory vaccination one kind another, broader erosion civil liberties resulted.

In 19th century compulsory smallpox vaccination upheld courts - compulsion enforced quarantine along infected refused get vaccinated. modern times, many states impose harsh handicaps children others vaccinated - like exclusion schools core social organizations. 

And yet descended tyranny via slippery slope compulsory vaccination. So, argument logical fallacy reason describe, also say years experience evidence overwhelmingly weighs alleged slippery slope. Arizonans need sit tight, mask turn Fox News off. There's nothing gained early death trying fight virus.

The Mexicans. Tennessee, two years ago. mom, retired nurse, told two days ago strain flu killed brother back. discount flu. far know, reason chose chimp virus one exposed really.

I know there's Chinese vaccine development human adenovirus vector, one looks bit less promising, like half everyone already antibodies vaccine itself.  payment last day. You‚Äôre doubling money have. Read question again. Yes, really. actually almost perfect experiment since Sweden, Norway, Finland Denmark extremely similar nearly every way. big outlier Denmark much higher population density (both overall capital compared capitals). that's huge deviation. Otherwise they're incredibly similar. happened ""This virus can't stand heat die come summer time...""? Yup. replying earlier comment talks Phase 2 Phase 3: ""Phase 3 add another 2,207 ICU beds surge capacity converting non-ICU beds."" went bed equal ICU capacity. See above. Rather saying ""not really"", perhaps try disprove argument, gave convincing one *why* comparing apples oranges. EO language specifically says can't detained wearing mask. give warnings/citations can't detained thus ID'd?

Spoiler alert: can't. 

This EO basically useless language it. law enforcement orother official may detain, arrest, confine jail person violation thisexecutive order related non-violent, non-felony offenses predicatedon violation executive order elderly feel like lived polio, small pox etc seem scary happening Texas too. What‚Äôs second mildest pandemic US history? Pie hole? bully early 2000s teen comedy? Yeah, put that. mean y'all jerks right back. (Doesn't help major media coasts, making rather uneven.) Honestly, logic positivity rate 25% Arizona, 18% Florida, anyone know rate Texas Cali? u...now wear mask friend's uncle died couple weeks ago procedure needed March got categorized non-essential ended getting last month instead, late.

Activity makes things 10 times worse. even noon yet, wtf. numbers yesterday? bad news: median age ticking up. 
Sliver good news: median age positives still lower state‚Äôs median age population (42.2). Test per million worse..its basic maths..the country bigger population overtime hv bigger numbers!! It‚Äôs called Depakote. put water Texas Florida. America, think Fourth July weekend going bad - worse Memorial Day terms virus transmission. stay strong stay smart. 

They say it‚Äôs always darkest dawn, feel like heading darkest days. dawn coming, see reports. survive summer, better things coming. Even general public getting vaccinated mass, fall living new reality - reality COVID-19 still rages, unlike today, large groups people (hopefully health care workers) inoculated observe hope optimism. 

... world bigger logistical problem COVID-19 problem. well relative tRump said shit hole countries - agree we've downward while... Sucks we‚Äôd taken virus seriously shit might ended already we‚Äôd normal summer back. Considering phases human testing normally take 2-3 years think stretch say rushed stretch yesting order pick harmful effects. people desperate allowed out. insider, contacted Independent reading in-depth investigation mega-labs earlier week, said: ‚ÄúThe Alderley Park Lighthouse Labs ongoing issue entire shifts cancelled due enough samples.

Also, noted 10.17% still double recommended limit 5%. May 12, 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments reopening, rates positivity testing (ie, tests conducted, many came back positive COVID-19) remain 5% lower least 14 company like Disney, would definitely kind coverage. warms heart! grandmother used make blankets homeless children feel inspired pick torch! there's anyone still believes Dr. Birx good faith actor disaster, listen Abbott's comments. said Dr. Birx reviewed approved Texas' plan reopening. don‚Äôt explain instead saying don‚Äôt that? Mexico millions dude. Yes president trying reopen capital city Hey dont sorry put past us... consolidation wealth power, nothing see here. wait vacant homes rentals start bought developers land grab starts. that's subpar testing Research might rushed, clinical trials expedited. mean term Americans use expedited research projects called ""warp speed"". jury still whether means rushing leaving unnecessary bureaucracy. played role, mostly specific person known making incoherent tweets throughout day night responsible spread. Informal test rationing due many symptomatic people. Leaves none low probability worriers - asymptomatic contacts. ""They yet"" also have.

Nor many things timeline, tbh. Disappointed, rarely surprised. made people gather AC ideal spread. Sure, wear masks, physician wife wears masks, millions Trumps followers don‚Äôt looking guidance write death certificates going real bummer wife.

America left well endorsed masks.

But CDC recommended masks since April 4th, still President rallied masks since then.

Projections change, change them, that‚Äôs novel things work.

Science lowered death toll people started distancing, people stopped distancing masks became controversial deaths started rising 131,485 deaths crap Vietnam zero.

Pretty pathetic response supposed stable genius continues downplay advice scientist physicians. Altho terms worldwide death tolls staggering 3k-5k onslaught March April. Since we've seen infection death toll per day stayed pretty much far. Teenagers feel way. sports, jobs get, much do, missing social connections teachers. Gojng back school going look different. I‚Äôve heard talks pe, music, theater art. curriculum basics hybrid setting. Teens okay right now. Wearing mask impose rights requiring wear seatbelt, stop red lights, drive limited speed certain roads. studies indicated 50% people get permanent lung damage. I'm sorry I'm going fact check JONNY Facebook never finished high school /s member staff Alderley Park Lighthouse Laboratory shared tranche emails sent lab bosses staff May June Independent.

They show 40 separate shifts labs cancelled past two months, often day‚Äôs notice less. I‚Äôve Florida twice past month work. times still stopping people border make sure weren‚Äôt NY. time NY cases already plummeted likely less daily positives Florida. way everything run Florida would surprised still requiring people NY quarantine. honestly way around point. making comments peoples posts nothing post itself

It‚Äôs stupid shouldn‚Äôt surprised get it. fucking way k-12 schools universities going open 6 weeks. Theres definitely meme potential 'Chad Ox' vaccine haha first time don‚Äôt get payed payday quit file unemployment. articel doesnt say research personal got paid stay home. It, fact, doesnt mention numbers specific groups all. It‚Äôs wild see 57,000 new cases yesterday. get terrifying whole new level. deaths going start piling up, hospitals going overran, Karen Darren still bit bitching masks. curious - one get disposable, short-term kidney transplant? Also could nasal spray. Now, wonder Color apologize saying khabibZ's dad fake illness khabib avoid fighting See can't even properly respond ask question it. deleted comment reads: 

I've never automoderated subreddit. even ""[word political philosophy based taking care citizens non-citizens]"" naughty word? see reasoning insults such, really believe bad things come merely mentioning it? Median age increasing good either. almost like young people live different planet old people. everyone die get us point. wondering, hard date given head UK's Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham, told MPs less optimistic jab could protect catching infection. said likely reduce severity symptoms.
She told House Commons Science Technology Committee relatively optimistic vaccine capable treating population soon available. would trade mild symptoms that?

You get decide asymptomatic not. trading 'no symptoms' 'mild symptoms,' trading 'maybe death, maybe long term complications, maybe spreading family watching die, maybe mild symptoms, maybe symptoms' 'maybe fever headache, definitely survival.' minutes ago  use soap... figured good enough hands, good enough plastic packaging.Or that's annoyance finding disinfectant wipes

That would work perfectly. soap bursts shell around virus faster time would own. Except promises aimed helping actual people. promises end things, build tax-money wasting wall, treat immigrants like shit.

Bernie wanted things actual people. Prettt big difference, I'd say fuck .... we'll get em next time boys Nobody needs hear one stupid fucking song anyway Conditioned actually getting DeSantis require masks? 15k cases. ridiculous. Thanks! useful comparison. Yea one knows sure. [CDC weekly levels influenza-like illness (ILI) COVID-19-like illness (CLI) activity remain lower peaks seen March April increasing regions.

But knows long hold true. sides equally ignorant! Although agree protests could spread virus. black woman complete agreement supported protests. found people dying disproportionately counterparts hundreds years systems country. group nothing lose created. parents fought Civil Rights movement are. country brought us point protestors. Hopefully well enough eat crow. seem informed general info, may need go back research, I'll end thought.

I understand whole take X years thing. mean, way, kinda like programming. writing modern web app assembly, would take long, long time. someone built browser tested it, someone built abstraction layers tested them, someone wrote javascript tested it. anything, standing shoulders giants. Holding things standard done time wise odd right? 

This global issue, many resources it. transport method similar virus tested years beforehand. Maybe blind optimism, research nonetheless.

No doubt understand concerns. upsetting argument lead deaths either way. Marginally. Sure, people hoarding TP, add [testing list looming shortages ...and serious shit. Without treatment protocol really matter, advantage he'll less density wherever treat (cleaner environment) chance shortage. keep body going immune system works. find interesting think minimum wage paycheck worth dying for. dat ShIP wAsnT EveN UsED NYC! Cool kid March understand. used tell grandchildren may get better, younger people smart enough see needs changed. tell may overly optimistic, go seems safest them. hate horrible mess come after. feel like I've watching slow motion train wreck stop fifty years. ended useless. Here's plan: Oncologists pediatrics nurses getting quick primer pressed critical care service Oh, agree completely. completely useless gives google big amp hosts data need 2 months ago, see CDC updated guidance include deaths there's compelling evidence virus caused testing COVID‚Äì19  conducted, acceptable report COVID‚Äì19 death certificate without  confirmation  circumstances  compelling within reasonable degree certainty. Seen Connecticut license plate driving Calgary day...if afford gas Connecticut Alaska fly. Well yes, clearly worked well. Norway *great* comparison, undoubtedly managed whole thing **much better**. this!:) Downvote paywall worst president lifetime work pandemic. country incompetent Italy.

And able stop inevitable.

As seen repeatedly already. Yes, would factor in, too. Either way, death rate lower now, seems continue reference old numbers. I'm sure completely stopped selling drugs definitely true, particularly live certain states. way lockdown hospitals overrun. starting happen. could learned NY, sadly ignored it. Yes imagine mass gathering pandemic drug addict held pregnant woman knife point murdered. pretty soft eh. given better knowledge treat it

Do we? death rate gone way down, read new, effective treatments. Yes, actually *moved up* starting date. Incredible right? hardest part honestly. makes sense systemic racism things come pass people good keeping fucked parts themselves.... social media. need vaccine make people less stupid calmer.

less CO2 air Ya like recurring knee injuries. think one point needed surgery, right fight injured knee needed surgery. injured again. finally fought fight another injury.

I'm probably misremembering timeline little bit, constantly injured. undefeated division Cody Garbrandt. Probably notable wins TJ Dillashaw Demetrious Johnson. Dude's joke. Really top-notch commentary fights too. MERS, COVID-19 SARS coronaviruses. end game Oxford Vaccine vaccinate coronaviruses. ....this agree/disagree thing, worst case complications vaccine administration. What's basis? education immunology pathology? Results higher prices profits. Question testing capacity support that. Yes, actually *moved up* starting date. Fucking brilliant eh? blame protesters. Blame racism. needed protest police brutality midst pandemic. 

But hey, America can't acknowledge flaws would mean admitting we're greatest country world everything *isn't* fine. actually think good idea. NFL likely start time anyway fall, even does, surely host hundred athletes half year academy sorts, double draft (one spring class one fall class) everything squared back couple million available then. think they‚Äôll hundred million end year manufacturing capacity 2 billion/year work service industry personally can‚Äôt wait called back work, hope even will. Glad would find anyone industry getting sick dying virus ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù though. officials say health crisis over, encourage large public gatherings. Wuhan residents go government sponsored fair, citing government statements health crisis over.

That happen. local Wuhan authorities tried downplay Beijing meeting go ahead. declared over. spread known across China point. Wuhan authorities also encouraging mask told go saw rumors WeChat doctors getting infected,‚Äù said Pan‚Äôs son-in-law, Zhang Siqiang. ‚ÄúBut insisted going. said, ‚ÄòThe government says it‚Äôs problem, cases anymore.‚Äô ‚Äù

A quote 76 year old patient government declaring they've controlled outbreak. Fully expected this, gym memberships notoriously hard get normally often Worldometer update? updates work exactly? False hope Seniors need stop taking, taking, Taking. using 5g, right?

/s im gonna make lies? Lol okay buddy...when 20 foreigners move state time NE getting hit hard wasnt because...these mfs hanging goats killing chickens outside APTS driving 40mph 15-20 mph sections...cops get called plenty times. quite apples apples comparison though, NYC peaked around 10k per day likely closer 30k. 

Still state state lock going work Federal response. Awesome. hope goes well. HUGE Oxford AstraZeneca said non-profit claiming contract yet changed terms service altering hours operation. late. ‚ÄúOver it‚Äù time shortage explained medical staff priority. 

Now production produced sufficient supply problem resistance. Well, Facebook owns Instagram so...  It‚Äôs delayed October say, reason wat? quick scroll articles related find something info. supposed increase Net Worth reported studies small number political advocacy groups, seems like strange place get information net worth individuals. 

One thing bugs types articles though... Even Vince McMahon suddenly worth $177 million COVID-19, mean Vince McMahon $177 million cash access $177 million liquidity. group probably looked assets said, ""oh hey, thing Vince owns probably valuable people looking entertainment options home before."" like say ""Apple worth $1 trillion"" mean suddenly $1 trillion hand. kinda got American schools different toward end comment, along things.

To start, virus already much widespread take hold spread much easier faster schools. Also American high schools urban suburban areas HUGE. Like small end 2,000 students bigger end 4,000. add least couple hundred staff more. also consider last mandate governor (less 2 weeks ago) stated require masks. June many schools allowing football programs come workout together large groups.

Japan population follow guidelines better society, that's seems working there. Americans already emphatically shown not. 317,000 confirmed cases USA past week. say yesterday?  flattering curve. Best got education. Shot due stock price still close pre corona Highs . Federal reserve fuckjng stock market everyday inflating 

Let‚Äôs make shit bad headlines plenty criticize . Now, read idiots parroting *""THIS DISEASE 99.5% SURVIVAL RATE, WORRIED IT?""* narrative, understand guy ""survived"" part survival.

Yes, great medical systems extend people's lives. Covid-19 destroys lungs, lung transplant. even double lung transplant. may even live double lung transplant. Covid killed you.

However, anyone WANT double lung transplant? anyone *want* strokes? go dialysis? legs amputated, pneumonia?

Hell, even extreme situations - anyone want sick can't get bed three weeks more, barely able eat, able smell taste? wheeze like old man 30s? gasp air?

I roll eyes see people posting time. Yes, doctors **can save life recklessly endanger it**, mean Coronavirus joke. title little misleading. boarder closure extended, Quarantine Act was, requires quarantine 14 days upon enter Canada Thanks! god damned genius. disagree, remind breed. daughter works bio lab talks unzip zip proteins. ‚Äúload‚Äù viruses genetic material, blah, blah, blah... talks like NBD. Blows mind. Love nerd scientist girl. two enjoying apocalyptic circle jerk amongst yourselves? I, one, appreciate Sweden took risk compare results. Unfortunately, claims wildly opposing, feels like politically driven. I'm hoping someday, smart person objective unbiased deep dive actually happened program Sweden closest thing control group. Tack, Sverige. fucking stupid hurts county hasnt death since April 1st. region decline completely past 10 weeks including total cases including 3 weeks outdoor dining. put lockdown? Yes, spread NY tourism travel. Sure, private schools formulate policies exemptions. Thank wishes. best. Yep. half-assed it, worst worlds specific providing source raw data. I've road preferring trust journalist's interpretation rather numbers, will. never said lower 5%, pointed 12-13% figure old. I'm really worried things now.

I think politicians desire what's necessary contain it. Basically, we‚Äôve already sold millions doses even prove efficacy, we‚Äôve also made connections governments around world buy product regardless competition creates. welcome competition chance.  Um actually, sides equally ignorant (or willfully ignorant hypocritical) admitting ""reason"" large gathering play role virus spread. states need put feet down

that would go certain beliefs people free make decisions. 9 given placebo study lasted 28 days. we're dead. guess proportionately large section smart people also protect them. think majority vaccinated though. Agreed, careful comparing positivity rates March/April now. Testing availability criteria changed completely. lower positivity rate expected available panicky public free without referral. Politicians definitely blameless. time certain parties 100Ÿ™ going lie have.  La Florida Tejas. te veas c√≥mo anda el asunto por all√≠. Mucha fuerza hermanos! think compare two types protests look attendance numbers duration protests. BLM protests went weeks, still going. thousands, even tens thousands attendance.
We know, based photos first hand accounts, 100% BLM wearing masks. Compliance heavily varied state. also know longer exposed, higher chance transmission. 

I live one liberal states support protests. don‚Äôt know people keep comparing lockdown protests BLM. One doesn‚Äôt justify other. pandemic. like big part problem, telling people need masks... thoughts vaccine may ready October early 2021? fair can't stay locked forever government refuses help stay financially afloat. think realistic either, could wrong far know phase 3 lasts several years phase entirely safety disorders, any, show like Guillain Barre syndrome. though... 

Source: history Maybe help highlight fucked medicare system . Maybe Americans deal system lead outrage system deserves hurled . capable vaccines, better. nation originate shouldn‚Äôt matter save lives... mean yeah dare pope stream, anyone stream.

But least stop fucking singing enclosed space hours end. definitely find consistency truth here. /u/Tuningislife wants open discussion returns Reddit, I'd like know masks useful protests celebrations. there's occasionally errors there. one day state reported like 10k cases 1k. simple typo guess took little correct Yea think ppl forget take 14 days show symptoms, maybe another week require hospitalization maybe another one someone die. pretty huge lag time btwn event infection death, definitely adds ppls approach. Think many ppl struggle delayed gratification basically idea worse outcome (maybe say think many people smoke literally knowing chances lead death) much love Khabib family. one greatest fighters ever set foot octagon. father taught much.

for fun, video young Khabib [wrestling Sure, cases spiking wildly extremely foolish make things worse, full-stop. 

And even open, kid point get exposed, might need isolate need parental supervision anyway.

That's mention expanded unemployment sick leave benefits, know, govt. help could eliminate staying home problem entirely.

Aaaand amount extra subs ppe testing bus routes schools need safely open become astronomically expensive might impossible anyway, especially title 1 schools risk already decrepit.

Id advocate staying online fall hoping vaccine available winter. not, saving entirety fall's expenditures help secure safety protocol expenses reason come back spring. US taken similar position. Money object. Trump spent lot money burn even money waste lives.

Your sacrifice high risk hospital employee shat upon daily. Sorry, thought discussing current events 2020, things happening 1970's.

I agreed 'rule', presume impose anyone Ironically , proving point. 

Err, no. exact opposite saying 'prove point'. Oh, right. case, agreement. know man, feel bad people really trying treat threat take seriously, powerful country world taken threat joke, things people saying laughable, mean president even said go away...he give shit anyone else himself.

Same goes rest people ignorant, people making country laughing stock, whole world looking Americs disbelief.

I sympathise people taking seriously say, hope others start see sense..

Cant gather together throw trump well something?. three hands could perform high 7.5 content google offer much faster. not. isit website made using wordpress uses google apis? Moderne worse  Yeah pushing reopen ask wear masks, bit damn late Reddit one person, sub especially hyper polarized coronavirus preventative measures. use common sense. near people extended periods, are, use mask. prevent spread.

If BBQ, share drinks, communal foods, make sure grill master mask gloves. Sure, maybe ECMO wasn‚Äôt managed properly. Maybe distal perfuser wasn‚Äôt put correctly. Etc etc etc. somewhere else, want let know I‚Äôm proud you‚Äôve turn life 180 degrees. Keep going data likes flu? Trying understand specific virus normal relationship viruses general.

I would say never flu despite around people work got bad cases. People stopped caring here. Remember place Reagan wet dream one point, maybe we‚Äôre going red again. idea it‚Äôs annoying. Misleading title headline, man. contract contract--until outcry goes public like business originated new generous policy. main problem f√∂r Sweden nursing homes, herd immunity strategy. 

Or maybe fact people die. people died Sweden year previous years? certainly case anywhere else Europe, strategy failed, pretty evident large number excess deaths comparison previous years. 

Yet, even total mortality Sweden remained [below strongest seasonal flu past thirty years. year [one lowest mortality rates past 40 

If look drag slider across, see high excess one week peak pandemic. entire pandemic Sweden show 'extremely high excess' shown UK, Italy, England, France, Belgium.

If look 2018, see high excesses across Europe tail end bad flu season. 

In 2017, Spain high excess, whille may others high excess. 

The simple fact is, Covid - caused mortalities - average number deaths across EU line previous years, comparable seasons, mortality rate Sweden lower normal. ""Supposed be""?

We've got three major fires burning right now. already bad. sure hope Thanks!  know. treated horribly. Absolute embarrassment state. everything misinformation someone unwilling consider conflicting information deaths come hospitals packed staff exhausted.

WE ALREADY SAW HAPPEN ONCE. ALREADY 3000 DAY DIEING.

THIS STUPID. comparison civil rights movement unremarkable every day Sunday sermon tone deaf white privilege could go. 

I hope token‚Äûblack friend‚Äú reads educate worthless ass. America given Covid. Border closed indefinitely theres vaccine. yup yup yup people failing understand this.

‚Äúugh simply can‚Äôt tell vaccine safe year‚Äù

bitch thang around switch protein covering fuck ass covid. Profits people. Period. It‚Äôs gross. Good. Rot. tool bag. Can‚Äôt stand listening lick Rogans ass podcast constantly. 

He little dog bouncing around big bulldog spike(Rogan). 
‚ÄúWe friends right?‚Äù Fortunately worship outdoors like protesters. ""It may become even harder ‚Äî paradoxically, even essential ‚Äî Americans increasingly get fed quarantining, flaunt social distancing rules act plain defiance public health guidelines.""

flout. It‚Äôs basically positive feedback system social scale. good reason many negative feedback systems found nature since inherently stable! hear quarantine method 100% effectiveness eating reduces number mouths feed. Win-win Karen catch anything like? Facebook like good guy contest exacerbates everyone's narcissism. Turns whole identity die hard advocate things know much care amuch bout meant got attention. True. end day, leaders failed us, personal responsibility, includes businesses conducting themselves. Everyone responsible protecting other's lives. pretty terrifying. Everyone trying bring logic, don‚Äôt try... there‚Äôs none had. walk away shaking head murmuring truth, ‚Äúget load idiots.‚Äù people living escape them.... Hiking strongly discouraged prohibited it. general consensus ""dont put situations need rescued"". I'm avid offroader spend much time back country. still went avoided anything risky made sure prepared emergencies able self sufficient event something happen (which norm us) said stayed within 50km home, made stops anything fuel etc. Back country camping also still allowed made overnight trips really saved us mentally going nuts. people acquire immunity infected COVID-19? so, long immunity last? may lag time spikes either recovery reported death. 

Just one example, average length stay COVID case hospital 28d. I'm diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 day one two develop severe COVID symptoms, succumb day 20 28, death reflected statistics much later. 

That said, area seeing spikes really lifted restrictions yet. neighboring states, younger people infected much higher rates. isolated late teens going vacations interacting others, per epidemiologists looking closely here. Before, mostly older people. newly infected people healthier, mortality may lower. That‚Äôs dictatorship handy. Stay inside/wear mask shot sight. Make number One! Tremendous! telling Bill Burr like wearing mask manly ridiculous. I've listened JRE years (casually, I'm fan his) interest nonsense. Best luck brother parts like, that‚Äôs rights something.

Fucking inconsistent dicks. Aww yes. even kill bugs lol. little mouse going die me. bought humane traps last resort. Literally hurt fucking thing. Lol test almost dying, mild cases non symptoms dont get tested. People wearing masks. Agreed last part. bulk bins food? I‚Äôm used refilling jars I‚Äôve got get plastic killing animals process. new pandemic arises like new swine flu? use single use plastics rest lives? Clintons, Bill Gates Elon Musk get vaccinated first tell anyone. hindsight, think highlighted global society (Education system emphasising critical thinking) ready sudden appearance social media. way aliens suddenly showed gave brutal iron-age societies ak-47s. Serenity. Thats get space reavers I'd finally able aim butt gun. Oh ton rural places outbreaks. ton without. That's point. Regional lockdowns. vitamin D?  public education america trash, many places still demanding creationist bullshit taught classroom. people cant understand anything beyond, 'but bible says....' guess people US wanted ""shake things"" voting Trump charge, realize kind catastrophe would actually cause. 100% shop Safeway right now. Still need orders doctor state. Americans worst hypocrites believe fake freedoms.  I'm trying downplay virus, learned back late February, however exponential growth can't last forever, virus USA probably peak around 75-150k cases, people going take seriously point. Also find weird deaths still followed up. might surprise learn US monolith, like 50 small nations bound together. there's practically federal response individual state governor lead way. states like NJ live declining infections strict adherence health protocols places like FL complete opposite. government actively resisting encouraging wearing masks, government hiding infection numbers. 

Just pointing statement meaningless vague. depends mean ""know"" someone. co-worker's aunt died it, I've certainly never met her. know many old people, office fairly small circle friends family large either. I'm certainly virus denier, think chances anyone actually interact dies fairly low. Ah, said gone thought already there, enjoy quiet, amazing solitude nature! Fox News, OANN, Rush Limbaugh, bullshit Facebook groups, bullshit YouTube channels. May CoVID19 brother.  I‚Äôm saying even remotely plausible, could imagine Trump got it, recovered (albeit perilously), permanent damage sort rendered unable publicly speak anymore? Talk karmic justice!

That said, he‚Äôd still able asshat Twitter, still, maybe it‚Äôd force thing two. also hard make assumption large heterogeneous country. looking national % positive, mean testing places actually spiking... mean opened bars right memorial day weekend surprising. wants money. alabama going learn far behind Italy New York terms healthcare access. going go well. worst part Rogan he‚Äôll parrot pseudoscience bro fitness friends much he‚Äôll parrot actual science scientists like Rhonda Patrick.  pandemic seem turned lot people anti-vaxxers guy, it‚Äôs definitely worth YouTube search ‚Äúpence‚Äù date.

Nobody that. mischaracterizing what's happening order make situation seem like something isn't.

Read article. [TURN According publicly post JHU CDC numbers daily US increase covid-19 cases running close 2% (and trending up) previous day's number. Yesterday 50,000+ new cases, 1.9% increase yesterday's 44,000+ cases. Yep. NY taken surprise. see numbers rising CA / FL / TX half year warning breaks heart. link numbers used hospitalization graph? I‚Äôd like send friend depends country. I‚Äôm US cannot refused medical services emergency (regardless private public). hospitals write bills. Dude hear you. even upgrade phone's OS immediately wait months lol. Brandon still minimizing, claiming he's almost back 100%. Prognosticator prognosticators, guy. notice New Jersey death total yesterday, pretty sure saw total point yesterday. unclear problem source Local, shared one SVT also downvoted. really make sense.  Prestige, I'd guess. Oxford make much money vaccine itself, think reputation boost! students want attract pick anywhere world: Oxford prestigious name right Cambridge, Caltech MIT. Oxford seen _saved world_? That's it, that's decided, that's number one place generation. question. posting article become ones question? posted 20 minutes article published. 

There post sub linking this, information pandemic sub about? voter registration, let someone else area vouch you(if documents). honestly nothing, call ask that.

Great job Rockland county! Alright, big guy I‚Äôll believe claims see science (obviously, science based). 

You live country run capitalis m, one little guys help run. America continuing past generations.

 sickest I've ever bronchitis,

What precautions take prevent it? assume quarantine life avoid getting diseases like bronchitis? doubt it, think many people getting ready fourth get tested. think numbers going go Monday; get spike. don‚Äôt seem understand. open send kids school happens outbreak?

He everything phone gets afraid swab could house chip. ""not great, terrible"" Incredible Oxford transparent trials methodologies. really hope vaccine one Agreed. Also we're 50% capacity let push tables together seat 18 people (they said ""but we're family, supposed do??"") even answer that?? attitude can't beat it. one safe safe. People US mobile, anywhere virus hide explode, return ""safe"" places. US opting herd immunity.

You realize yet. Everyone seems forget everytime it‚Äôs convenient. Doctors: acknowledge risk that, this, this, this, this, also install XYZ Pharma's vaccine toolbar, this, this, accept unsolicited mail sponsors ten years, this, this, this, 

You: install, install, click, click, yes, yes, install ... that? .... fuck .... Install, install, yes, yes ..... No, wait ... Ahhh fuck it, install, install, yes, yes, install .... Wait hear new Edge browser built Chromium they're tired trying get browser work google tech. going beautiful, tremendous celebration, celebration important word, meaningful. celebrate beautifully many people celebrate. nursing homes Cuomo good job there? grandmother died nursing home NY likely Cuomo forcing recovering Covid patients back nursing homes still contagious. top comment? sounds like ambiguously directed grade school insult. Yep true fact drug side effects balanced good does. would willing bet incidence heart conditions lower US.  choice risk side effects Malaria. Unfortunately Covid dangerous people US highest risk heart conditions. Especially secondary obesity.  Antibodies aren‚Äôt thing give immunity. cells also provide immunity.

There actually study recently showed ever 1 person antibodies, 2 people COVID specific Cells antibodies. Good luck, need  Again, several months learn difference COVID-19 flu tell that, conversation having, chosen to.

I feel obligation try educate people unwilling learn.

You Google. I'm Google mean, isn‚Äôt known, safe virus vector. China‚Äôs dosing military one speak. one Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford (ChAdOx) Chimp specific, can‚Äôt properly replicate humans, *can* insert code generates COVID spike protein, cells generate tons protein body learns attack cells producing SPIKE boom: you‚Äôve got immunity. Still better 70% need herd immunity take upvote. people work healthcare mean they're careful this.

my physical therapy appointment cancelled week last weekend, pt went bar someone awaiting test results. fortunately, caught potentially exposed. Well, situation exactly they're talking People testing negative coronavirus antibodies may still immunity, study suggested.

Who knows true though. guess automod disagrees position. mean people thought way Disneyworld going open yet we‚Äôre week away theyre full steam ahead ü§™ many people obesity killed? experience working group settings people en masse, that's actually smart assumption make.

People can't coordinate shit shit right now. Take seriously want to. also wear mask avoid crowds protect grandma. see friends want to. People please stop acting like Karen's, right thing, quit offended government asks right thing.


This there's laws drunk driving, shooting guns air celebrate things like 4th July. put others danger, society demand government enforce rules vs making suggestions asking nicely. probably afford test 6000 people attending make sure virus transmissions. imagine convention safer attend going grocery store Houston. would require little bit money corrupt testing process. need corrupt testing process GOP members get test result back less day. thought point vaccine teach body identify viruses tell immune systems antibodies produce effectively fight it.

So technically catch virus, immune system makes short work it. ~~life~~, liberty ~~pursuit happiness~~ Universities area announced reopening move-in plans first week August. insane. lets tiptoe around issue here, ""masks political"" exactly bumbling morons love with. one I'm talking moved NYC NZ 5 years ago.

I know handful Americans beside know well all. I‚Äôll believe claims see science (obviously, science based). 

You live country run capitalism, one little guys help run. America continuing past generations. Drop nationalism see world include weekend things calmed down? fair, stupidity, malicious intent. He's looking way superficially prop markets public perception. Lol, far away 1 week away. going never get vaccine? see much ‚Äúif‚Äù ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù Even though many universities biotech companies making advances, it‚Äôs extremely difficult create working vaccine. Call test site, I'd pretty surprised lease name drivers license name along explanation moved suffice proof state residence. Yikes

Well, uhh, least we're less 1 percent closer herd immunity, right? going huge.
Make America sick again! mean, isn‚Äôt really surprising. lot news articles sub could processed ‚ÄúIn shock fucking one.‚Äù It‚Äôs gonna get ugly people dumb. way see things getting better government gets heavy handed starts finding people really enforcing lockdowns. won‚Äôt happen muh freedumb. That's brilliant. UK think people know/remember always large amount scepticism there's even slightest whiff impropriety regarding miracle drugs. Dude same. stoked. asthma medicines use maintain. URI potentially fucked me, flu especially COVID19 super scary. .7%

I want take odds could avoid it. tWo WeEkS agreed 'rule', presume impose anyone else.

I impose rule, apologized talking context today. Sure draft might exist today well, magnitude past, case personally think thats valid enough reason allow government force mandatory vaccinations people.  Society told too, I‚Äôd never tell friends this, plans every marrying, it‚Äôs trap modern day recipe heartbreak #bachelorlifeforever mumps vaccine 1967. agree, religion types thinking certainly behave like viruses, wish knew effective ""vaccine"" too. think it‚Äôs adorable people talk ‚Äúsecond shutdown‚Äù though young healthy people $0 savings good obedient little lemmings. Even ran giant experiment demonstrating basically give fuck coronavirus live tell he‚Äôs saying ? world‚Äôs highest per capita death tolls ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù? Sounds like need another COVID task-force briefing. 

(bright side: need build 'the wall' Mexico closing border). idiot-in-chief literally called rising number cases 'great news' in, course, tweet. get hopes you. worst types. ones pretend nice. It‚Äôs pretty gross. Meanwhile Disney World plans opening 1.5 weeks Florida becomes epicenter virus. 

Disney even put repulsive [propaganda video happy Cast Members back Disney keep everyone safe. side effects? 

Malaria used big problem, medication makes go blind deaf. vaccine based malaria meds? (which shown effect Wu Flu promising start.) Well, contagion rate diminish, seems probable there's new people infect people take seriously work hospital talked lot health care workers I've realized pretty common. Texas, kinda successfully practiced last several months US wonderful results. US winning. government would need put vaccine water supply like mind control chemicals. /s Even successes pissed away. WTF people?!?!?! today number 4? hope likely. How? weekly data update Thursday, Tuesdays, issue. Thanks clarification. Even without mouth mouth, virus definitely spread cpr. 

I accept apology it‚Äôs ok Honest question: percentage friends American? That‚Äôs time weed data. Ya know, ‚Äúclean up‚Äù NY NJ fucked nursing homes, afaik, following CDC guidance time. grown ass man around get testing high enough?! Well, he‚Äôs anti-Christ, shouldn‚Äôt far off, right? southeast

There‚Äôs problem right Covidnado? difficult science-minded person days say things like: ""I told so"". Maybe ""the current patterns spread infections experiencing consistent computer models predictions two months ago"" would easier accept people like wear red baseball hats? try ""You want things reopen? want go NBA game? want go MLB game? want travel overseas? Wear god damn mask things!"". r/technicallythetruth Yeah... sympathies man's family. least parents died relatively quickly. could even imagine mother told needed lung transplant looking scar chest going ""WTF?"" survived CoVid-19.

She would cried longest time bum knee hip needed work, healthy CoVid. Healthier actually. Nope, tried that. Three months heavy urban areas and... Things let up, hell breaks loose 4-5 weeks things SLOWLY open up..

We either means keep vulnerable fraction, or.. don't, they're fucked. 4 months get ducks row, treatment options, medication production ramped up, masks/PPE sourced, work home sorted, logistics reduced people, etc..

You can't lock things 18 months. We're ALREADY BROKE, comes man.. mean people absolutely ZERO symptoms. even cold symptoms. Asymptotic cases tricky they‚Äôre rarely ever counted total official case counts. work Feds. work local mayor. Remindme! 1 month


It's already month. Keep pushing goalpost. hysteria driving country straight ground. think goal exempting polling places scare people away voting. De facto voter suppression sure Italy would go back lockdown level cases since NY case number today much higher they've gotten past week two. mean overall 7 day moving average cases still indication they're experiencing another spike cases. 7 day moving average deaths also still way peak. 

Yes NY badly hit country would worst terms deaths per capita. way past peak indication control. compare current situation NY say Florida, Texas etc clear NY much better right now. Florida Texas seeing huge spike cases hospitalisations. Infact Florida Texas much worse right compared April/May seemed ok. states contributing cases US longer NY. Disappointing consider learnt NY Looks like testing lot, deaths way down. American Academy Pediatrics recommends kids returning school fall...

Things actually improving lot. hear media. It‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm baffled ignorant people really be.

Definitely pretty anxious lately. keep pushing narrative, nationwide deaths useful metric one region falling peak climbing. look states virus raging, see deaths climbing since early June worst static, certainly trend ongoing, see worldometer, today people died yesterday, first time happened point normal weekly cycle since Mid May.

We arrived tipping point deaths. going need new narrative next week. I‚Äôm still waiting Ohio‚Äôs official numbers site apparently got hacked today. Worldometer shows 800+ 9 deaths heard 1300+ local news source. agree. Maybe split fine money police department public health dept county.

My city no-enforcement mask ordinance. dread building reopens public. Pockets city good masks, overall less 25% probably wear workplace, get million visitors per year.

Lord knows local cops get right ticket patrol high fines ignore little things like car break reports. last apartment complex string dozen two weeks got even come take statements escalated apartment break ins. Hoping healthy pregnancy birth baby you!! Protesting injustice stupid? 

I provide lots evidence people wear masks protesting would like. Heck, people handed masks protesters wear without one. work call center. worked home.. still do, depending state work in. I've heard experienced, ideal, customers management extremely understanding kids pets heard calls.

 


Life happens, real, everyone knows what's up. Relax, tends make around relax well, seems make communication easier. bad news they‚Äôve already forced return work remember shitting hit 20k globally. I'm numb think hospitals collapsing isn‚Äôt happening. Hospitals empty happen though. seem looking rebut claim one made. say? muricans need party. Gotta fight, right Paaaarrrrty!! Finally. sources? reputable link? research ? wanna see source

Wouldn't surprised crack 70K next Wednesday, assuming there's enough testing done news stock market almost fully rebounded 11% unemployment isn‚Äôt bad alone. though?

Ya, I'm starting wonder we're going still country end this. kind stuff ends empires. We're Chernobyl moment. Jez.. :( Well, remember: Kids close proximity, teachers yell scream little Johnny Janie go bathroom clean sneeze, many parents send kids school knowingly sick.

I mean **knowingly:** know little X fever still send school anyway.

My mother father seemed ones K-12 school complained feeling bad took temperature even 2 degrees normal send school ""I want make people's children sick!"" bouncing around 1-4% NJ, near 60% peak shit not. Plus reserve day advance, without idea weather like day. can‚Äôt keep paying employees revenue, central Florida depends tourism dollars. get it. least serious masks.

Oh wait... are? health professionals joined protests handed masks? mean anti-mask protestors like ReOpen people? happened nicer CEO. This. I'm furious Abbott Patrick putting children population large risk insulated consequences. 

They've ignoring situation since day 1, fact would rather let thousands die acknowlege faults try help infuriating. 

I never angry disgusted state's governor leadership right now.  Enjoy hundreds thousands deaths. They're fault. Also Americans military done ruin world countless times bomb innocent people.

Just worked NZ prove works cases lockdown factor. could completely different variables idea contributed.

I also wonder Pandemic office eventually announce Masks necessary social distancing necessary wonder Trump finally wear mask public supporters stop conspiracy theories actually wear mask. 

If office leads people wearing masks socially distancing im AMERICA NUMBER 1 BABY hey flu... /sigh sounds bad cases rise, death rate not.

Mostly due widespread testing young people testing positive.

I wholeheartedly agree people need take virus seriously. really easy, however, misrepresent science published. I've noticing couple themes around sub recently:

(1) Mutation bad: **FALSE**. Mutation happens. bad, good, is. Preliminary evidence suggests specific mutation SARS-CoV-2 allows virus replicate efficiently. Whether translates (pun intended) increased transmissibility researched. LOT potential confounders ""more replication"" ""more infective."" 

(2) Antibodies end immunity: **FALSE**. Antibodies important immunity sure! T-cells, memory T-cells mechanisms. Recent come showing strong retention memory T-cells asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic individuals bodes well longer term immunity.

Need add lag asymptomatic/(technically presymptomatic) period first. 

It takes 2 days 2 weeks show symptoms. average 5 days. 
And hospitalization usually occurs second week symptoms. got symptoms day 5 exposure, would days 12-19 think. 

I forget long hospitalization period average die, think usually end 2nd week hospitalization. they're gonna die, is. 

If so, total time exposure death around :
(5 day avg show symptoms) + (hospitalized 7 14 days symptoms appear) + (death 14 days hospitalization)
= 12 days lagging period fast death
And 33 days lagging standard death (of person symptoms 28 days. bad symptoms 14 days) 1 hour delay fetching comments.

Yeah, 12% seems max get full symptoms, 60% recovers 2-4 weekd, remaining fraction ends hospitalized may die.  blame stupidity trump? Americans capable thinking themselves? Historically 1 week infection symptoms, another week two symptoms hospitalization, another 2 weeks hospitalization release, 3ish weeks depending get tested, 3-6 weeks lag positive test death recovery Something think school districts come plans resuming classes fall. kids dying like elderly mean getting sick recovering without lasting damage. time pay piper decades increasing number kids class. way person maintain social distancing. Anyone thinks half kids class alternating days realistic big classrooms are, can't fit 15-20 kids 6ft. ""We're best breaking records. best records! Nobody breaks records us!"" rest country position New York back march, states anything like public health funding New York does, Texas , Arizona Florida already seeing shortages beds medicine.

Our worst case scenario right expects 400,000 + dead Texas alone. assume Florida least bad, they're cagey releasing information guess. It‚Äôs like malicious lie. Essential workers needed prevent slew contamination. mention low supplies people working healthcare facilities, ya know, people would directly interacting covid patients. hoped rest us would stay inside keep away others. bad many even that. perfectly, no, think could create merit based selection system works least bit better ""let dumbest half population 50% say gets charge""? true. Even outside pandemic hard prove cause death. middle pandemic prove conclusively heart attack / pneumonia caused covid infection? Sometimes often would take resources realistically available. Different countries take different approaches terms lenient recording deaths caused covid. That‚Äôs best measure excess deaths - deaths average expected given time period. every single country (that reports numbers), excess deaths official covid death figures. even authorities lenient attributing heart attacks etc. covid still under-reporting true numbers. 

Basically it‚Äôs statistical problem conspiracy. forget South Africa. Remember aaaawwlamo:( still think needs rounds checks going though. issue many jobs listed open anymore. Lots places forced shut again, really think many people going out, tipping well either.

So right need focus preventing spread virus, making sure people feel forced working low wage jobs put high risk. Stimulus checks would doing, also would keeping people streets making sure economy stable awhile.

Without that.. going take larger hit Senate realizes. force people back work, get sick, hospitals get many people. back square one. Going ""How prevent problem? Dr. Fauci?"" ""I told you.. jack asses. Keep things closed awhile, make sure people feel safe trust you.. "" Sounds like grandparents telling hydroxychloroquinalone* cure coronavirus, health care professionals administer Trump supports Vote out... keep every election cycle gone. Feel free leave anytime, one stopping you. would imagine entire school district started staggering school days local daycares would recognize opportunity facilitate need day day childcare. Disney probably can't claim business interruption insurance coverage legally forced close think overestimate people‚Äôs ability spot obesity normalized. I‚Äôm shocked, tell you! Shocked! way title phrased made seem like good thing bit.  One months 200k nothing compared see. Hold on... Montana now. Masks maybe 50% best. People dining even restaurant workers aren‚Äôt wearing them.

Thanks :) Many us (not me) put ruling elite there. Didn‚Äôt stop working SARS basically went away? american question is. every country america flattening curve? hearing america? anything testing amount. 100 percent states place jeopardy. airports borders open, spread. see hard needs many studies?

Oh someday! optimism schools teach do. remember years back suggestion local (maybe state) level add ""character development"" like 30 minutes per week K-3 something. It'd teaching things like cooperation, perseverance, kindness, etc. way people reacted think proposed teaching kids murder parents.  Oh, wanting roast Abbott this. see lot wearing masks got straight crazy people Texas calling Abbott Liberal Sheep refusing wear masks. gonna wild ride Cowboy. Hold tight cowboy hats. Decent job reducing virus? planet living on? Yes real one time. Take care, all! [Here ya  literally work one campuses totality information I've gotten subject leave Gettysburg Museum, leat state, leave country. may go slightly, enough flatten curve. look post-reopening Texas case sample - case numbers relatively stable (neither increasing decreasing significant measure) first started ballooning control restrictions eased further. Ahhhhhhhhhh see now. Sorry, really unclear. bad. positive test rates going way many states last month. pandemic getting worse, increased testing would mean lower positive rate. Also, Florida increasing last week without meaningful increase testing numbers.

The idea testing cause rise incorrect. nursing home admins care money. last options request outside help transfer patients, cost money. US following China. China attempting contain eradicate. 

The US opting herd immunity. 6 months ago .. US better controlling damage official charge approval FDA take company‚Äôs studies face value. result, 17 babies born complications thalidomide. [Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey hero honored JFK. work education too. I‚Äôm looking work pretty much eyeing online teaching jobs year.

Many states going fudge opting reopen start normal school schedule. another disaster end September. Hospitals already filling up. get bad decide lives dies. agree you, tracking device within body allows much data analyzed smartphone, mostly involving persons body. means anything, can‚Äôt see drugs persons system etc phone. heros. Thank you. totally fuck New Year celebrations though? People wound locked wrong city whatnot. Nah, would voluntary implementing lockdowns people actually following two different things. Americans shelter place again. without clear federal leadership imposes modicum control states. mean, we've got mask order city, local sheriff refuses enforce ""it's unconstitutional."" Despite really fucking constitutional. he's elected official, can't kick without recall. Case density Texas yet high. information entirely clear. ER doctor, patient arrived suddenly, breathing, doctor time put protective suit. article said doctor helped breathing, word used differentiate mouth mouth, ambubag even intubation. possible mistranslated it. Either way, ER doctor rushed give non-breathing covid patient CPR without protective suit, got infected died within week. Jacksonville south yeaaah. Miami, nooooo Note dreaded SPIKE began early June. Hospitalization death rates aren‚Äôt tracking new infection rates all. people advocating catastrophic ideas like lockdown need reminded fact relentlessly. maybe i‚Äôm stupid compared you, opinions sensitive data reality least. 

i don‚Äôt think assess herd immunity would look like without knowing many people exposed virus (every new positive test could imply cases never tested). deleted facebook new year resolution, ragrets far. thi k taking pandemic seriously.

It immediate threat everyone's health. us priority humanity right now. Advocate change, know responsible virus control. truly amazing, point held accountable damage they've done? Masks ""nice have,"" stop spread end epidemic. situation Mexico far worse U.S. right now. care either way. I'm hearing Big 3 Michigan... 1. Yes, sadly, nurses attacked. justifying events massive super spreader events thousands people gathered.

2. Yes, Mexican President downplayed virus MARCH, beginning pandemic. President United States hosting rallies WEEKS AGO, pandemic. want social distance rules applied this. He's also refusing wear mask also downplayed virus saying magically dissappear beginning pandemic even current trajectory. also said LESS testing LESS cases would reported. 

3. Even Mexico's death toll ""probably around"" 70,000, USA's death toll still higher 132000. Yes, know USA bigger larger population. stating fact. 

4. say Mexico I'm talking people health providers, government. 

5. case missing point I'm way saying Mexico better US, saying US great either fact borders Sonora closed due insensitivity (not all) Americans, completely justifiable. think politician guts call it. yet, anyways. good chunk people would protest follow rules, anyways. think going going be. feel you, really do! retired 30 years education. diagnosed last April w/a serious heart condition. understand feel &amp; father. suggestions/what ifs...do really good school lined up? example, find niche teaching &amp; 1st terrible assignments/schools. put starting job? Maybe online education based work. Many companies looking home based teachers due pandemic, example. could tutor computer. Special ed. places emailing like crazy see sessions line w/families. Ugh feel you!! remember excited 1st classroom. Maybe state switch online learning? wish could help crazy times. Good luck!!! wonder many breakups/divorces triggered divided thinking couples, whether related virus, protests, similar, many delayed need get time financially practically. live Brazil say same. Incredible bad management downplay crysis. Someone tell they're disappointment, clearly parents failed task. Yeah places headroom grow 8x rate cases now, would make comparable.

The good news places r(t) 1.4 instead 3.0-5.0 hit NYC/Lombardy/Wuhan, time make policy changes.  It'll take month climb 8x places really get horrible, took 9 days places 6 days NYC virus 8x start this. gets bad, hospitals overrun deaths shoot up, seems inevitable, think backlash folks going huge. saw greatest transfer wealth country happen right eyes. 

I mean, look sharks circled PPP came out. fuck-huge companies clamped leaving small businesses flounder big banks funneled friends. 

Look stock market kept gaining less half workforce work imports/exports gone wayside.

We're fucked, disgusting. worst part is, we're prolonging expanding pain we're going feel stupidity we're handling pandemic. 

I'm willing bet 99.9% anti-maskers also stim check receivers realize stupid fucked either. He's ICU 3+ months. That's 15k/day 100 days - probably 1.5million. - guidance Imperial College London - also predicted 'no lockdown' approach Sweden would result nearly 1,000 deaths PER DAY. 

Turns [they massive 

So, yeah - can't really blame Swedes paying much heed Tedros pandemonium crew. exit anti-masker phase return anti-vaxxer phase... mindset changed forcing everyone wear mask. robust way it. Otherwise ""herding cats"". got deserved pretty lofty ideas future parenting kid (and teacher camp counselor years). would say things like ‚Äúmy kid would never entitled brat like one! one must spoiled! Parents need x kid doesn‚Äôt act way!‚Äù 

Guess - kid acts like entitled brat sometimes. do. 

Parenting long game. best instill values behaviors kids mature slower others, difficult personalities. saying - even best parenting result kids sometimes act like bad parenting. Colleges going hot Covid mess. hospital admissions? South Africa, France, UK, India, Egypt, Belgium, Luxembourg, Australia, Canada, New Zealand fragile. delicate. vulnerable.

Handle care. Call bank stop payment monthly, whatever timely, charge. Russia literal hotbed rona. dad likely got there. fair, US letting documented Mexicans cross. general people M√©xico careful, using masks. Live Houston. certainly going on, feel like that's accurate description. Depending area, high mask usage. Bars closed again. Yes lot people stupid things, also lot smart people smart things. log onto facebook spread dumb stories ACTUALLY tracked. stupid hurts..... Anti-vaxxers world. France particularly high amount right now. cyclical societal, oddly apolitical.  Serum Institute India tasked manufacturing vaccine already manufactured sizeable amount case vaccine gets approval. India UK might probably first ones receive it.  english native language. send kid away beginning take back. stay till end. you. choice one parent stay home. big kid help take care small one. country 10 year old take care 3 4 year old. sure pay check though sure closed bank. Maybe keep minimum people run background. hard possible. impossible overcome something call thing like Essential. Well, develop vaccine, that's looking promising, wont forever. 

Additionally, feasible raise taxes ultra-wealthy, online purchases, corporations pay taxes...or slashing completely insane military budget....it done.

 Hell, started 1.5 Trillion (size last stimulus) dollar stock market bailout passed 24 hours. money there. (And read issues Pete Peterson's austerity theories wish look further)

I'd accept premise unlikely so, very, possible. Look Canada, example, essentially implemented UBI start this. know going happen, plausible scenario? eventually reach heard immunity, first country world? Yeah, even Abbott admitting it, another shutdown coming. way, happen me! belongs prison. That's pretty low bar clear It‚Äôs horrible. hospital staff going suffer terribly. man reached levels stupidity think even possible coming person least stand up. embarrassing lump garbage. didn‚Äôt get way I‚Äôm going go sit lot people probably get infected! reduces data usage, completely useles. 

Sure bad, im fan wrong claims arguing something. I‚Äôve seen many unpractical ideas, especially sub, it‚Äôs hard know. 

I work food manufacturing, lay people don‚Äôt understand magnitude takes go farm fork. number likely even higher 40% since can‚Äôt detect virus children living infected parents. Wonder hospitalization rate is? US basically point go herd immunity data like would helpful estimate impact virus swept 330 million Americans. That's pretty harsh judgment someone's shove entertainment. Would say othe non sports activities? 

 Good thing Bridge tournaments canceled bridge clubs shut down. Hopefully bridge players realize need focus solving world's problems.... makes amount sense different activity. Yeah think anyone prevent anyone protesting. concern anything even remotely suggests spread protests viewed attack reasons behind them. 

The fact black brown communities see institutionalized racism big enough issue definitely say something, overwhelming support public general. issue ""I worried protest increasing spread virus"" conflated ""I want protest cause worthy."" *sighs* website owner chooses use WordPress.

With amp, people forced opt-in miss massive chunks mobile traffic. Google abusing position dominant search engine divert traffic systems. best numbers! I've seen they're beautiful! May ask why? mean, successfully making vaccines decades. Attenuated virus vaccines don‚Äôt even pose risk infection. It‚Äôs like scientists going put poison them. understand, difference vaccines say, flu, viral material. Unfortunately, high. absence leadership federal level looks like. i'm speaking early gracies, pick anyone would considered MMA goat asked year 2000. would fare discussion like this? 

kareem wilt still discussion nba goat (or least top 5), babe ruth mlb goat discussion, hell even someone like tom brady nfl goat discussion even 5 years records (aside championships) broken Forland said elsewhere: believes critical debate interviewed several Swedish media ask questions things support Sweden's strategy. feels like want support government strategy. Sweden goes whole think Swedish media love Stoltenberg leans towards Swedish strategy. nice copy europeans soccer tbh entirely right; though would add people shit came Google, hell bent believing Google SOMETHING, part plan. Note Bing started use AMP, Good Guys bring XBoxes VS Code now. still insanely evil somehow write bills, patients left declare bankruptcy fuck credit years escape medical debt. slave labor force? Nice little hoax got there, AZ. also heard medical people say bullshit medical practice. may changing proverbial cat bag heard people know better. Stupid people everywhere. tv show called community funny say god everywhere invented universe, want hear you, go specific building. think major disconnect. Like, reopen restaurants schools everything else, can‚Äôt really force people go feel unsafe. Contrary politicians said, actually *isn‚Äôt* anything important life, viewed individual perspective. mention risk morbidity massive medical expenses, mentioned. things become pretty trivial face kind risk. 25%, quite likely significant amount underreporting due undertesting. real problem, many countries, serological studies put number infection 10 times confirmed infections. 

It really measure whether testing enough. ""middle class"" destroyed.

All independent small business owners threat. huge number people lost middle class jobs working part-time minimum wage. Alright! Sign 3 Oxford vaccines, fries coke. Fauci lied masks working beginning save front line workers lol amp shit. google trying take internet Maybe could annual vaccine like flu boosters maintain immunity. ‚Äú Dr. Bikowski said hospital's supply remdesivir, drug received emergency use approval Food Drug Administration treat COVID-19, gone.‚Äù MIB3 ref? know. *do* know I'm 14yo kid Internet wilds? mean people playing quarters front lawns? beer pong? that's happening since early spring. Casinos among things last open. necessary essential anything. **Me:** US opting herd immunity unlike China. 

You: US China.

Me: No, China containing. US not. 

You: Herd immunity good US poorly. 

You like this. choose to. unnecessarily frustrating exchange ultimately agree We‚Äôll talk overcame adversity it‚Äôs No. Abbott sniveling political animal idiot. Dan Patrick idiot. mean, venal idiot. worst. accept us going get virus protect elderly pre existing conditions. Beard masks. think first time years fireworks Ottawa Canada day. Maybe fireworks 4th?? Especially since I‚Äôm traveling country right now. get sniffles many evangelical churches like visit ‚Äòhealed‚Äô. Ugh, trip planned end September still on, includes cabana service one big pool complexes; taking little hope I‚Äôd able go risk fucking life nearly October. Goddamnit. go without bikini tops beaches then, awesome! Jack fine, Hand like candy use money fund covid relief efforts... beginning real crash burn. Sure, faction loyal grave faction size, smaller, bigger 2016? We'll find 4 months. Right potus worst enemy. I'd good letting continue fool stakes high. Well it‚Äôs piss poor reason, they‚Äôre supposed responsible leaders setting example insecure babies worried people think UK scientists found existing drug, Dexamethasone quite effective.

My understanding one single study steroid even released full data people look at. study UK oxford found patients 4 times less likely die april/march due variety reasons.

I saw that, way control possibly different makeup people ICU's admitted hospital different times. 3 weeks 100k day? That‚Äôs amazing news! Definite yes wearing masks. Maybe don‚Äôt wear outside know keep least 6 feet distance. might wear private office, wear common areas work.

They let housekeepers repair people come, wear masks and/or work nobody house around.

They go grocery stores, masks stores people social distancing.

No indoor dining restaurants, yes takeout, outdoor dining social distancing 

Some let mail sit day, don‚Äôt.

No going inside friends‚Äô houses, yes small outdoor visits. food shared containers.

Haircuts precautions like making sure customers time.

If kids wanted go protest political rally, warn it‚Äôs risky wear masks get close people.

No gyms. indoor pools, maybe outdoor pools they‚Äôre crowded.

No routine doctor dentist checkups.

Ask precautions going doctor- masks, disinfecting, keeping sick well patients separated.

They‚Äôre divided work- telework, go office masks temperature checks everybody there.

Most would shake anybody‚Äôs hand, one thinks might never go back it.

Most would send kids back school fall, schools taking precautions.

Some say may vaccine sometime year, say 2021. Covfefe.... puzzle pieces... falling place... Gone Easter! understand 4 months america still enough national foresight/planning/execution get hot spot hospitals supplies need i'm still gonna go cookout. pool covid basically nonexistent studies say. cookout big, maybe 10-20 people. yeah peace out. 2000 cases day isn‚Äôt bad. friend delusional. Worldometers would it. first read name billy Joel wanted know you. Lets forget false negative rate- 20-38%. umm cant. doesnt work like lol Death toll way low, though. different before. Fauci said masks appropriate beginning. metal gymnastics people sub impressive. use among sites looking data Naw, love Karen, makes lol. Almost \~15% death rate.. wonder so. Higher age group ?

Thanks! national society, absolutely deserve this. responsible steady destruction institutions support networks ensure pandemic bad possible. share responsibility deserve deal accept consequences actions. Except college aged students make around 1% covid cases. So, plan is:

* open schools spite COVID rampant parents work

* teachers students get COVID

* schools shut anyway

....see actually solve problem? Something like one several hundred thousand. Remind death rate covid?

According Forbes, billionaires US combined worth around 3 trillion. took literally everything own, much isn‚Äôt liquid, could pay two rounds stimulus... that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs assuming wouldn‚Äôt hide assets move overseas.

And general agree cuts military budget, cut much especially global uncertainty war likely before. 

I feel like many others don‚Äôt grasp economics work think hand cash indefinitely forever. Nothing novel vaccines - manufacturing something already proved elsewhere vastly different cf research novel vaccines Plandemic /s hang there, too! ‚ù§Ô∏è also wonder G strain might turning slightly less virulent well. Faster spread yes maybe, maybe, lost bit 'punch'. know demonstrated research yet however. Lol ""look tough guy nose throat out"" Texas March April really low level infection. really exploded month June, last 3 weeks particular. 

Of course, that‚Äôs exponential growth works, science always there, wasn‚Äôt intuitive clear huge chunk population. mono step time.

Everyone giving fuck got mess. pay attention say. Pay attention do.  Plus, unemployment benefits different. understand people want blame protesters instead blaming person kneeled another persons neck 8 minutes killed camera remorse. looking someone blame turn anger police 200 years systematic abuse. Blame politicians continue fail us every possible turn pandemic. Blame local business owners who's ignorance continues fuel virus. Blame billionaire corporations ran trillion dollars tax money zero site government allowed it. Blame fellow American's who's entitlement endangers everyone us. Stop coward stand up. laughed gonna lie. 

Apparently varies regionally, I've seen people elsewhere write sine teachers online system takes sin 

Although there's confusion sinŒ∏ way might motivate people believe safe take Trump, Pence, Biden, whoever running mate is, Sanders, McConnell, Pelosi, Fauci, Birx maybe influential house members getting vaccine live broadcast.

You're overlooking pervasive conspiratorial thinking country. They'd say ""that real vaccine, they're gonna microchip get it, sheeple."". vaccine mandated, way see done employers using requirement come work. Saw too. total huckster. Like lil mini-trump. trying flex thing scratch every part back I‚Äôll get vaccine 4-5 years. Gotta let test me. Nobody believe vaccines takes years,
to decades properly develop. Yup. actually kind liked public hospital used live near, trauma unit great staff, even clientele kinda scary. 

Think like public university vs private university. public hospital give ‚Äúin-county‚Äù ‚Äúin-region‚Äù discounts usually pretty sizable. example, spent night ER got bill, $700 automatic discount. 

Private hospitals cheaper still, generous ‚Äúscholarship‚Äù money, need based. I‚Äôve couple free, uninsured ER visits bill getting wrote poor (they didn‚Äôt even send bill, paid me) Many people masks on, +outdoors, + alot protestors we're aiming social distancing. help tear gas...coughing, spitting &amp; spewing, sans masked affected peeps contributed. 
FWIW, supported protesting *energetically* home. 
By large, bars. slight suspicion lot pro-life too. pandemic shows dimensions irony never thought could achieved Well, much anymore. Government funded testing sites defunded dismantled Donnie-boy wanted ""slow testing down""

That means, unfortunately, areas, they're removing testing site many afford letting private companies testing ends costing quite bit without insurance. Thank you. Drink water. Remember said need masks? Nah, Florida dodgy reporting deaths. literally muzzled medical examiners State's count lower compiled list deaths medical examiners. 
 
This article back end April: 
 
I'm sure aware fired data scientist charge dashboard alleges 'fudge' data make counties look like ready reopen. claim ""insubordinate."" Perhaps encouraged masks since day 1. Huh... wonder /u/tenYearsTenDays didn‚Äôt post one rate every American Covid 15 years! Strange see country modern Bulgaria use least bag mask respiration hospital. Congrats recovery! got this! Medication first-line treatment everybody anxiety disorders. Pick one That's need trails capture risks. would nervous get vaccine sufficiently vetted. hope don‚Äôt get cute side effects. need get fever day two big whop. would take Diaz him. love comment ""obvious underlying condition"": make disposable? Deservable? put higher risk category matter people mourn person. Nobody disposable. ANDY BIGGSBITCH LIKE IT! ""Hope so"" sounding like president. ""I hope virus goes away like miracle"" listen fullnuttdder- first, last... I‚Äôm big hairy American winning machine, know? rookie numbers... wait week two. Hope brain implant like Rim World know: may eligible paid sick leave once: crushed economy bafflingly declared working parents inessential.


lady you‚Äôre *food blogger*, that‚Äôs job done home pajamas kids they‚Äôve gone bed - that‚Äôs almost definition ‚Äúinessential‚Äù job lmao Remember big deal world hit 200,000 cases total? good ol days Honestly couldn‚Äôt imagine wife wasn‚Äôt able stay home. Should‚Äôve taken seriously March. Noobs xd late No, actually think president governors responsibility educate public point American ignorant basic facts COVID-19, pre-symptomatic spread.

Campaigns drinking driving, smoking, etc. We‚Äôve done many times before. messaging important. shockedpikachu.jpg parents left us home somehow turned okay. Admittedly stupid shit lol. Good job proving Governor right! Yeah believe India, Brazil, Mexico steadily growing. mean one highest IQ knows everything everything? also says ""No one ever saw"" ""No one could ever imagined"" stable genius? Yeah, stable genius sure genius. I'm impressed comment deleted yet. It‚Äôs quite common among patients bedridden Covid. 

This guy got one arms: No, means pass willing tell passed to. Instead staying silent letting HIV kill victim. bet cops start wearing masks protect spewing germs place, ones valve them. Hes busy struggling basics. Give credit. it‚Äôs really fucking relevant. I'm talking happens reality pointing stupidity logic. r-word get banned Twitter, example, nothing else mentioned will. people general condemn use r-word turn around call someone ""an absolute fucking moron"" 5 minutes later political thread ask someone dropped head baby. 

Also note dumb guy comedies always subnormal intelligence. Stan Laurel Homer Simpson, nobody dumb intellectual disability. Probably good advice regardless pandemic. insane see happening, like really shitty movie there's condensed chaos context understand plot. 

I always used think 'that's dumb, real life we'd actual handle problem' 

And are, problem growing exponentially there's legitimately talk disbanding force that's recommend fix issue increased rate testing results increased number new cases. would true anywhere virus exists. Sucks maybe stupid fucks see put goddam mask  noted US presently hitting record spread across much hottest regions even we‚Äôre getting hot season. favorite comment twitter responding governor guy said won‚Äôt wear mask it‚Äôs hoax also won‚Äôt allowed legally carry gun anymore wherever goes. 

His paranoia circular. I'm still waiting spike cases anti-lockdown protests, socially distancing wearing masks. Even person voting Wisconsin lot concern. Bangsa penjajah memang camtuü§òüòîdiorang ingat orang Asia Tenggara bodoh macam kita tak boleh nak membendung pandemik ni. break Alabama. Tell take things go. Throw toothbrush, donate blue sweater dumb stuffed animals. Burn book shitty poems gave us.

Why call contenders? Puerto Rico DC lookin real cute now.üòò frequented establishment people pooped floor I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd notice own.

Plus movie theater employees blasted bud, syrup, benedryl k pins probably dreamt whole thing. 

Who fuck poops floor like animal? problem testing itself, United States paying attention economic disparities plague less fortunate students, happen mainly black minorities. like said, SAT required certain state schools go community college. 


The problem economic disparity allocating resources funding impoverished areas, resources fortunate students. Simply getting rid SAT entirely effective answer, unfair students happen born fortunate circumstances take advantage resources. reason dissuade using them, ENTIRELY wrong say.

Using PPE case put get protection. Gloves examples heavily misused. Masks probably less misused too. lots things supposed things drilled medical professionals.  mean makes sense. There's strong denial academics, science, medicine large groups US. Mix people's entitlement, denial, indiviualizim. US perfect mixture disaster can't work together anything whole group lot people choose stay ignorant ignore things. 

In end it'll good wakeup call country. I'm super proud us right now. I'm badmouthing guy badmouth him. ""current scientific evidence"" time. Maybe err side caution? see happening China back January? think people grasp yet bad get. Here's story covering I'm talking Feb. First off, making studies canceled. canceled substantially increased patients risk dying.

Second, one report it, sources, one lets post them, media ignores ~~healing crystals~~ malaria medication. 

Bullshit.

Do know many respiratory, clotting, viral diseases HCQ helps with? all? big fat zero. 

I'll pass anti-science debate. Provide peer reviewed source showing direct positive benefit want taken seriously. Thank you. Much appreciated. higher last Thursday‚Äôs total LA County‚Äôs 55 new deaths added, actually mark first equivalent day, week-over-week death increase we‚Äôve quite while*.

Edit: also haven‚Äôt recorded New Jersey‚Äôs 27 new deaths today either.

Second Edit: *Actually, appears increase 6/23 vs. 6/16. try fail. test get data. confidence authorities, authority.

You figure allies are. understand everyone needs help. believe people show are, first time. seem great day :) Agreed Ew Yes, many cities allowed one person per family every two three days go buy food. Wuhan, though, go government delivery quite time. He's going really steep, really narrow curve. unironically agree additional person wearing one win, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs finally happened, think I‚Äôm bit cynical.

I think anything, might help psychologically people might start think ‚ÄúOh wait, actually serious‚Äù. Hopefully it‚Äôll go there. people already trying squirrel way wearing mask, don‚Äôt think anything. 4 days ago: point locking overwhelm hospitals, almost every country took approach. sad truth is, meant die, meant die.

If hope look therapy. deserve develop enough empathy self respect learn care people. 

(And parroting skepticism handed elites want us work pandemic support free thinker) becoming quite obvious Americans going told go home stay there, again.  ""state secret"" stuff made show. real life, flaw AZ-5 system disseminated, plant operators take special note since buried pile bureaucratic paperwork. accident, Chernobyl Unit 4 already scheduled AZ-5 system fixed later 1986.  Bubba? Cause see lot idiots wearing masks around here, half men. paid hard earned money tickets gov‚Äôment‚Äôs gonna take right‚Äôs away! mean South China Sea? American ships go there, Chinese ships? People gonna care lot people outside Florida flock Orlando bring covid back home them. I'll allow it. See table one actual study, particularly age group seems extreme. title changed say 'US VP' instead name 'Pence' honestly probably helpful people live countries might know Pence name. hardly seems like editorializing.  Eh, there's probably lesser charge like reckless endangerment, right? Oh gotcha yeah lol Well fuck governor Texas   long think? May suggest going USA tab hitting projections? pretty spot on. age group cases right IFR .009% (90 ppl one million). 
Wear mask, protect elderly. 

*watch doomers downvote facts* That's opinion.


A naive opinion, still.

Likely? reason we're surges. mystery. Pretty good social distancing tho MN too. also lend monies wall. Absolute bullshit try legitimize presidents lies guy. Infections cause immediate deaths. Deaths follow days weeks. fuckin course people ain't catching dying immediately good. lord. BIG part problem. inability interpret grasp importance information data. armchair epidemiologists everywhere trying put spin numbers, even publicly criticizing experts. Elon Musk one prominent example. throughly incompetent president I'm small city state Rio de Janeiro.

Yep. love every dire ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs many cases‚Äù post gets upvoted stratosphere good news related vaccines, antibodies treatments get 2.5k upvotes most.  doubt there's lot billionaires running supermarket. people *please* start taking hydroxychloroquine Covid-19, pretty please? manufacturer certain politicians really, really want try it, whether there's evidence helps not. chance get rich(er), really, *we* deny that?

This another free pass get. seen beaches? insanely crowded. Concerts ourdoors too, suggesting they're fine? Right. Trump's handling COVID-19 potential reach GWB levels evil, far he's ~15% way there. Standardized tests perfect, probably least bad method evaluating applicants.

Oh, Susan right? Exactly! agree.. sentiments exactly. ironic thing prioritizing money people actually going worse money point view -- chasing dimes dropping dollars. far, really looks like containment (or aggressive suppression, least, containment possible) way ""get back normal,"" otherwise we'll stuck limbo rolling lockdowns lack consumer confidence. Yeah...it would be. American exceptionalism imperialism bad thing, USA done lot world well. USA ceased major world power, would fill vacuum? European Union Canada/Australia/New Zealand strong alliance, combined military, economic cultural power stand rising powers like China, Russia India. would honestly likely lead another global war fracturing good alliances. Germany calling. Bars restaurants closed solid 4 months. Masks were, still are, required go shopping anything else public indoors. Social distancing required although lot people getting bit lax that.

[Frankly, close We're less 7k active cases single digit dead per day. know got info, bullshit.

We've recently started slow opening went pub last 2 Bundesliga games (first time since February) half tables closed chairs top taped down. allowed approach bar staff masks. could take long sitting down. keep mine anyway, unless I'm taking drink.

I'm sure quotes around word government, seems like favour government forcing vaccine people.

My argument short sited thing give power government. easy say ""They force anything else future us want, one vaccine"", believe that. may us see negatives , kids , grandkids. 

And again, nano robots crazy conspiracy, keeping government decisions need made ""needs"" injected bodies. definition whats ""needed"" could change point future. believe comparison medication development created drug becoming OTC far removed. promptly idiots. driven young, extremely low estimated death rate. swine flu vaccine 1976 proof positive.

Survivorship bias.

Drunk drivers good parallel. people think stupid risky decision. someone it, likely havent caught accident.

Even though statistically means every time likely bad result; minds dont think like that. brains wired see nothing bad happened last 10 times, 'safe' continue dangerous behavior.

Some people wired take risks, less.

It's evolutionary equivalent putting eggs two baskets instead one. ~Californians~ Americans losing fear coronavirus know you, comes one adult around bunch children day, would hope adult qualified. I'm sure trust new hire teacher who's willing work pandemic. guys phones? Vaccine behaves like vaccine Oh Trump nothing say vaccine gets made. I‚Äôm expressing desperate things return normal. Half Americans care article says scream rights, rights. Wait till vacinee people refuse get Yes are! Unfortunately, airline accepting valid exception. Even though official border restrictions say that, individual nations. 

I've trying get flight Istanbul, luck yet. Right flight Iceland July 28th, we'll see works. Absolutely untrue. exact vaccine manufactured large quantities world strength early-stage results. approved millions billions doses ready roll day. could September/October. Unexpected sed people saying stores violating constitutional rights even understand rights constitution protects. us understand works, necessarily disagreeing point. take vaccine it‚Äôs riskier health *not* take it. I‚Äôm higher-risk population (immunocompromised moderate asthma) don‚Äôt want die covid-19.

My treatment initially rushed market potential ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù drug ... it‚Äôs worked GREAT far. time, longterm health effects still relatively unknown. give explicit informed consent, adhere stack printed guidelines regular testing (dozens vials bloodwork, MRIs, spinal taps, etc) remain trial. 

Just saying. Again, I‚Äôm disagreeing point coronavirus vaccine trials substantial, are, even Phase II trial standards. They‚Äôre huge. awesome. sun medical advances treatment virus lowered death rate sure. doesn‚Äôt matter though hospitals become overwhelmed. Actually, experience gives knowledge news apparently isn't.

Let's give newest member, Texas, big round applause. That's definitely true. think 1000's employees working strip go back communities unknowingly spread it. Whatever though, feel like start. Deaths/cases kinda useless metric, wildly differing testing levels - mid March cases/infections maybe 1/100, perhaps 1/3. time, testing numbers went 25x. Every single RTC found provide protective benefit.

He finished first comment line, incorrect. cherry-picked lines briefs conclusions studies made sound like studies looking question mask effectiveness finding effect, case. $$$$. Pretty ridiculous universities care students health much meat processing plants. Remember Bush Jr. whole ""Mission Accomplished"" debacle?

God miss days. ‚ÄúThe Oxford Coronavirus Vaccine
About 8,000 Britons enrolled Oxford vaccine trial manufactured AstraZeneca. However, rates infection country gone down, researchers looking involving 4,000 Brazilians 2,000 South Africans study.

The vaccine comes experimental coronavirus jab tested Pfizer Inc German partner BioNTech. Furthermore, found produce neutralizing antibodies 1.8 2.8 times greater seen recovered coronavirus patients.‚Äù ? Exactly. needed real hard two-three months starting March. two-three months stood public health infrastructure needed testing tracing.

It‚Äôs economy worse it, government spend money. Great. Shallower? really think sharing fake news , conspiracy theories useless debates deep? Again, vaccine development research basically began 2012 earlier. technique used, adenovirus vaccine vector, using non replicating adenovirus target virus, case covid's spike protein encoded generate immune response produce antibodies covid. vaccine vector one promising new vaccine development methods modern vaccine science. Saying that, method around least 16 years AFAIK. way scientists throwing something together trying inject people it. 

While covid recent, SARS MERS aren't. Looking timeline research, would comparable vaccine development time spans. actually arent areas bars opened. actually regions never entered phase 4 increasing. coming IOS 14? significant selection bias present study setup makes unsuitable. study trashed. I.. living rock empathy taken ride politicians news networks. Maybe decades overdue Constitutional Amendment. What‚Äôs frustrating it‚Äôs even burden, it‚Äôs mask worn public protect others. There‚Äôs negative effects whatsoever, it‚Äôs slightly uncomfortable worst. crisis really shown jut ignorant self-serving people are. Ok well clearly going agree this, ok. point also moot since here. 

So still worry them. country run man believes little amulet pocket protect C-19. 

So reguardless right wrong, still worry them. Fourth July plans. He'd revolt people suddenly change plans that. true statement. Evolution pushes infectios disease agents higher transmissibility,. all. much virulence inhibits transmissibility, see decreasing virulence. Ebola virus fails spread due incredible virulence. Presumably next several hundred years see ebola become less virulent. Covid spreads pretty damn good time kills spread effectively. 


THERE EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE COVID BECOME LESS VIRULENT. DROP VIRULANCE RANDOM CHANCE INCREASE POPULATION PREVALENCE. New study finds scientists asses stuffed full heads.

They find whatever *paid* find.

We need eliminate corporate sponsored research. problem allegedly solve worth perpetuating current atmosphere scientists integrity paid research grants.

The world better research falsified research. comment took words mouth. I‚Äôm going take responsibility people‚Äôs views topic. say constantly learning.

Well.. are, ground. hasnt moved yet, think injecting lysol veins. 

The fuck think would happen? 14 day quarantine actually enforced? Wait kicks tomorrow people smashed faces pub, good luck enforcing social distancing then! Physical therapists really knowledgeable great do.

TECHNICALLY TESTING

IF LOWER TESTING 0 GO AWAY one writers black mirror? ""we cant keep economy closed forever!"" Exactly. needed real hard two-three months starting March. two-three months stood public health infrastructure needed testing tracing.

It‚Äôs economy worse it, government spend money. Great. Thanks c onservstives can't prove naturally immune never produce antibodies, read facebook must true. 

 

There study done May found Sars-Cov-2 maybe five times widespread previously thought, therefore may considered *five times less deadly*.

The research, conducted team scientists University Hospital Zurich, titled:[ ‚ÄúSystemic mucosal antibody secretion specific SARS-CoV-2 mild versus severe found Sars-Cov-2-specific antibodies appear severe cases, 1 5.

The authors infer antibodies inexplicably absent majority mild cases covid19. But, given known inaccuracy diagnostic tests well-documented tendencies over-diagnose clinical observation, another potential explanation would appear absent antibodies due fact subjects *never actually infected SARS-COV-2 first place*, ‚Äòmild‚Äô cold-like symptoms due pathogen, like‚Ä¶the common cold.

In words, large numbers people may immune resistant virus already infected coronaviruses.

This may surprising, given close relationship coronaviruses, indicator virus, known harmless vast majority cases, neither especially unique especially dangerous. must live America.

By law UK (EU?) Gyms must offer short term signup. Would Oxford vaccine still protect mutation? prefer pseudo-scientific bullshit allowed posted?

I'm purely talking British manufacture back British science. countries companies. like US China masks, order govt. side effect ‚Äúit makes dick bigger!‚Äù think would overdoses. ghost Christmas past, bad boy. Final numbers day posted 6PM Pacific time. people countries early measures thinking virus big deal. winning stupidity. let die little bit, maybe learn. even doubt...  MERS family viruses?  LOL. Karen. Smh damn :( Education could used that, isn‚Äôt valued highly ‚ÄòMurica. wish virus anyone fuck guy.

Unfortunately virus simply kills stupidest among us. concerned people person's proximity, people friend circle smart enough keep distance. work DeSantis. would depend talking about. mandate private business let without mask, would okay.

A mandate government however knowing protective rights forced anything United States citizens are... see courts going either way that. I'd say reopening people refuse something simple wear face mask protect other.  Thanks careful could wake bathtub full ice missing kidney. /s Wait, immune response sees *spike protein* next time actual COVID virus enters body? ""USA best country world"", people start leaving basic survival expenses become insufferable Somebody's got dirty butthole probably take things seriously.... You‚Äôre insane. decide people voting for? #prayforBrendan site people looking stats?? use worldmeters seems like cases reported Thursday‚Äôs Thursday last growth 21% there. That‚Äôs across entire week. rate wouldn‚Äôt hit 100,000 day 3 weeks would peak. wouldn‚Äôt averaging another week so. 

Has worldmeter become shit something? awhile seemed like accurate quickest update. Isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm getting called COVID denier saying options things consider ‚Äúlock everyone immediately vaccine!‚Äù Lol alerts Fort Worth. JB mean certainly regressive AZ, it‚Äôs bad. Nobody wants see this. I‚Äôm putting perspective bad early states were. AZs peak isn‚Äôt NYs, thankfully, long doesn‚Äôt get worse AZ. True, need watch ICU capacity closely. Ventilator supply non-issue now, sending countries last checked. alternative site plan limited finding big space bringing beds. lot people needed work it.

‚ÄúWe already entered contract company supply nurses contract we‚Äôve also put what‚Äôs known star request state assistance well staff alternative care facility,‚Äù said Eckhardt.

This interesting. However anyone put convention center getting vent. Anyone know vaccine expected similar flu shot effective? flu shot believe wouldn‚Äôt work unless got exact flu strain shot around year. Since flu virus changes slightly, lots people got shot still got flu. I‚Äôm anti-vaccine makes hesitate flu shot. wondering vaccine would different. Meh, thats like saying anyone died Pearl Harbor didnt serve WWII technically war point. Yes Yup.

We're own. say long pharma company prices reach Americans. I've seen people Supermarket LA wearing masks nose chin. Remember too, Federal Reserve jumping pumping pure inflation market, all, look gold; HEALTHY MARKET STANDING STILL DEVALUEING RELATION GOLD.

It sounds like businesses desperate cash flow... fully willing literally sacrifice next week tomorrow. even short term anymore, short sightedness hit immediate term. Subpoena bodies solitary confinement (aka, quarantine) get tested cooperate contact tracing. One reasons mentioned kids might need go back school parents work. mention people say public health experts don‚Äôt think care economy.

There‚Äôs room different levels risk tolerance kids (and things, though probably extreme things like wearing masks crowding bars). That‚Äôs lovely Drinking partying friends thing people have. Nah, already fear virus continue fear. deny virus say deep state hoax bring new world order masks. Trump‚Äôs fault? Everyone vulnerable shelter place home vaccine. Trump‚Äôs fault relative stuck inside? Lol child's intelligence correlate happiness? They're kid, they're already kind dumb. It‚Äôs coming breaking point. Eat fucking rich, boil alive suck marrow bones Mexico isn‚Äôt handling virus well either. That‚Äôs border shut months ago. Asserting getting entitled Karening OK, neat! say makes someone 3x immune. 3x *antibodies*. 3x immune. know 3x immunue zero x immune. Antibodies full story immune response. different infectious agents, antibody response might primary indication immunity might mean nothing all. 

We know 3x antibodies provides defense infection. possible does. possible doesn't. encouraging, let mean something doesn't. COVID already. yet wear mask. I‚Äôm contagious won‚Äôt catch again. I‚Äôm physician wear example shit show ain‚Äôt over. Californians came escape lockdown. stay inside Summer, apparently virus likes AC too. Barf. quiet senile sociopath Life go point. It‚Äôs much fact nobody WANTS sit home year governments don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good idea either. 4 friends beat they're fine. Long term effects small minority cases. 2 weeks announce 4th July celebrations didn‚Äôt cause uptick cases. like Memorial Day. 

But... 6-7 weeks may saying, ‚Äúoh shit, probably closed everything 4th‚Äù. Spikes spikes spikes... protests levels 3-4 infections may hit end July.

I guess making sure August September cooked, too?

Dont buy hype. people florida care. Actually alot do, I'm sure continute believe internet media wants believe. wasting time thinking going sway feel type way LIVE HERE, I've ER mayo clinic last week, I'm able walk outside see what's happening. dont need rely media tell feel interpret something. disgusting much people defend negative info without anything backing besides somebody's opinion. dont understand either. used live SD fb feed filled friends INDOORS mask... w.

Joe Rogan fucking moron possibly surprise anybody? made fortune researching anything, reading anything writing anything. He's Kardashian roids worse hair.  please link source? blm protests? One HIV vaccine trials ended vaccinated group notably higher rate HIV placebo group.

It‚Äôs possible fluke, vaccine obviously effective way. remember 1990s, tech CEOs really shady stuff world business (like Bill Gates). victims usually rich people owned competing companies.

Now folks like Zuckerberg-who literally undermine public health make excuses dictators committing genocide (Myammar example). pretty laughable along. [redacted] believed shit.  antivax.

Now antivax.  Best luck. grew mountains Colorado, I'm sure understand actually rural means. closest hospital almost 100 miles away, hospital county. saying right failing understand urban hospitals high population areas, fill quickly. non cult people worried about. ""Only outcome data untreated control group community based public reference  available patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, etc.""

It means literally nothing controlled for. paper survive peer review. could different strain flu together. got hit sativa strain part condescending? First edition pretty much anything I've ever interacted utter shit, understand people wary jumping things day 1. I'm California everyone know back going work unless tech still working home. still go work 5 days week pay rent government telling go see friends weekend pretty bullshit. yes know UK company producing it. India either, iirc there's 3-5 ""official"" producers Oxfords blessing. Honestly, take much decent job. president always come looking bad situation, even average person could far better job listening Fauci letting take department. Summer new intern season... know long virus live outside host? Like towel bowl? glad actually Reaver reference ‚ù§Ô∏è okay podcasts clearly anti-mask? That‚Äôs happened California, that‚Äôs happened lot southern states. 

They reopened early, mitigation measures place, take charge responsibly sent many mixed messages, like Greg Abbott‚Äôs case. 

He passed executive order allowed cities take precautions need. one city arrested woman reopened shop lockdown rules, Abbott changed policy couldn‚Äôt bail people let go hero. 

Please pay attention. outbreak people taking seriously, citizens officials. That‚Äôs great üí™üèΩ prodded doctor covid-related labs I'm run next batch needed check symptoms ordered. We'd done extra labs low dose blood thinners classic ""covid toes"" while.

Because early, actually mostly cleared covid even knew it. anosmia 6 weeks announced symptom. (This friend mine calls ""covid hipster."") I‚Äôve crazy impressed gym. day lockdown emailed said freezing payments. opened offered additional 3 months didn‚Äôt feel safe. also emailed home workout routines.

I almost wanted give money handling well keep saying people hear variants ""but economy"" ""what children"" - virus care. need working real effective elearning forced matter anyone wants needs feels hopes. wall really neo-liberal racist nonsense State really looking hilariously ironic retrospect. wasn‚Äôt confused two, completely understand less clear could been. think situation already screwed protests/riots

No. Thankfully, demonstrations ultimately [did lead significant spike cases. feared might, far available evidence shown otherwise. cases transmission (a lot police officers caught began spreading it) lead massive rise. spikes seen USA right seem primarily reopening states loosening lock downs, also demonstrable consider fact states highest increase numbers south, many protests, things opened lot sooner even resistance mask wearing keeping certain things closed least limited.

The virus seems spread easily indoors places like stores, bars, restaurants, gyms, factories, offices, churches, schools, public transit, flights etc recirculated air even limited ways socially distance. Another cause wearing masks, since lot American states cities specific orders mandating them, obvious see rise cases people allowed return sort places.

Unfortunately, much community transmission even chaos terms country (since almost direction federal level), going even harder contain. July 4th likely see lot people parties getting together, going continue make things worse. Bioterrorism jokes. (I hope.) Nice. Ireland less deaths total Sweden outside care homes. Ireland less deaths total Sweden last 9 weeks.

God shit again. MONTHS old now. There's 2 strains since march. Seems harsh least Karen's Chad's insisting get haircut think twice there's $1,500 fine potential jail time... actually tweeted increased testing great news.  asymptomatic positive. 2 friends positive got tested. I‚Äôm downplaying virus you‚Äôre healthy individual isn‚Äôt dangerous. health concerns cautious. 

Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm saying social distance wear masks. that. data suggests guy who‚Äôs fit like Shaub virus isn‚Äôt going dangerous him. know. Different studies come different estimates. bullshit story. 

WHO‚Äôs initial timeline included Dec 31, ""Wuhan municipal health commission reported cluster cases pneumonia Wuhan. novel coronavirus eventually identified.""

The ‚Äúeventually identified‚Äù never meant identified Dec 31. confirming cases later identified covid. 

But article claims: ‚ÄúWHO clearly stated virus identified December 31.‚Äù

WHO made historical timeline clearer idiots like article author, removing ‚Äúa novel coronavirus eventually identified‚Äù Dec 31 date putting 9th Jan coronavirus confirmed. 

The old timeline new one Every organization, institution, country puppet controlled China looking like city may put mandatory mask order effect. One exceptions people respiratory issues. Suddenly I'm surrounded friends serious respiratory problems. I've played sports guys. I've gone running problems suddenly can't breathe there's piece cloth face. get it. I'm individual rights one right put someone else's life danger. Like speeding dui, laws protect others.That's can't get dui private land. quoted comment seem read process implications it. Reopening leads cases 1-2 weeks later, cases lead deaths another 1-2 weeks later. expect death spike start 2-4 weeks re-openings, is, time line, right now.

No. actually starting 2 weeks ago. ""Right now"" would end like someone said, ""it's raining 5 minutes I'm little wet I'm soaking wet."" someone replies ""it takes 10 minutes get soaking wet"" ""refute"" saying ""yeah buts raining 5 minutes they're little wet soaking wet.""

No. like everybody telling takes 10 minutes get soaking wet rain, 20 minutes started raining everyone bone dry.

Opening up, protests, etc. started 1 - 2 months ago. last month things got ""really serious"" far re-opening BLM protests.

And days past point&lt;, daily deaths still trending down.

Already one month ago everybody saying saying - ""Give time! Deaths lag!""

And waited waited waited. are. news doesnt even talk deaths anymore. Everything switched ""cases"" death number remarkably low, news doesnt want mention that.

You would *think* ""Lowest Covid deaths since March!"" would cool headline *somebody* run, right? nope. Italy really good shape rn Protect others way seat belts do. immediate benefit safer car, extended benefit reducing chances, cost, ER accident. Think mask seatbelt, around face. Without car part.

Ireland began lockdown March 12th - stage 1 death 43 cases.

By time March 24th came closed everything - school, bars, restaurants, businesses, public buildings, work home, etc. 

By 16th March, practically everything shut down. 17th March, streets empty. 

On 24th, government announced theatres, clubs, gyms, leisure centres, hairdressers, betting shops, marts, markets, casinos, bingo halls, libraries similar outlets close.¬†*But already closed.* point staying open streets empty.

Despite - Ireland almost identical per capita mortality rate Sweden almost entire pandemic. last weeks Sweden's rate rise higher. 

At present, Sweden 184 deaths per million Ireland. Irish terms, translates 920 deaths (184 x 5 million). 

Were lockdowns worth that? 

The pandemic put people job hospital waiting lists. closed thousands businesses, many never re-open. 

These destructive measures lead many problems future - depression, personal debt, drug &amp; drink abuse, suicides, mental &amp; physical health problems. destroy lives, families relationships. 

Yes, slowed spread virus yes, probably saved relatively small number lives. higher prevalence, higher number deaths, inside outside nursing homes. 

And true extent, virus control general population, danger remained high nursing homes.¬† 

A significant problem residential care facilities function like homes hospitals. Many residents accustomed considerably freedoms would otherwise case clinical setting. even - rate mortalities inevitable - systematic failure compounded issue greatly. 

 CEO Nursing Homes Ireland, Tadhg Daly adamant crisis nursing homes inevitable.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe inevitable terms scale challenge find in,‚Äù said April. 

‚ÄúYes, clear nursing home sector high risk vulnerability resident profile, age profile and, course, given you‚Äôre congregated setting. doesn‚Äôt equate deaths purely ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù, said.

By 17th March - practically entire country home - guidance Health Service *still calling* suspension visits.¬† took days for¬†[guidance become clear.¬†In meantime, health officials insisted action unnecessary. Publicly, government even said measures ‚Äú*not necessary*‚Äù impact decision could residents.¬†

**In words, shut barn door left fucking thing wide open people risk.** think ""experts"" giving public unreasonable sense safety regard sending kids school. Two months ago experts told us important society re-open gyms, bars restaurants. clearly disaster, experts telling us fault people went bars restaurants.

 hear ""experts"" several months massive covid-19 outbreaks occur public schools? ""How could parents bee stupid send kids public school pandemic?"" guess. Damn media continues reprint old shit knowing get clicks. frustrating. skipped King's day Netherlands, royal family vlogging instead. big deal all. accidentally word friend It‚Äôs disturbing country run literal retards would doggy matter opposed missionary reverse cowgirl? Madagascar Greenland too. Covid played game before. issue mainly statement ""The Local Sweden well reputed source within Sweden"". untrue, also indication Sweden distancing since march. know live Sweden, live ""an arms length minimum"" standard months.
It became legislation w/e now, know set laws generally first july/january. Lots elderly people

Almost none, actually. Median age Nunavut 25. offset much smoking causes many health defects.

As first questions, recently arrived mining worker. You‚Äôre wrong man. North Carolinians full part . bubble denial many people turn political... many affected feel isn‚Äôt real. everyone part beginning would much different position. 

And called ‚Äúgood‚Äù triangle hospitals wasted time . Instead giving actual ICU training nurses wasted time... constantly flexed nurses off... disgrace . care $$$ mention level care inferior compared highly recognized hospitals country. 

You say think want them... provide great patient satisfaction ... comes providing actual high acuity care it‚Äôs another story... worked north small community hospital that‚Äôs level care far superior big name hospitals here. 

We fucked

/end rant It‚Äôs fairly Impossible find formation Japan. sigh. also can't work look situation US totally flabbergasted. feel sorry American neighbours - unbelievable US allowed get position.

I see 50K infections DAY yet still people power downplaying risks sowing fear misinformation. people supposed provide sober guidance look welfare citizens. appear happening world looking horror nightmare starting unfold.

For perspective. live province Canada population South Carolina. majority citizens live two major (densely populated) cities. 3 million 5 million change citzens live two places none people live igloo woods. locked mid March week things open life gone back normal part. total 2900 Covid cases almost 200 deaths. Currently 17 people hospital Covid 9 new cases yesterday. health authorities watching cases closely ready shut things necessary. Politicians focussed keeping economy going (anyone loses job, stays home work sick even stays home look sick person gets strings attached $2000/month plus enhanced payments social security social assistance help vulnerable citizens seniors. government purchased large number motels offering free housing medical homeless citizens thousands. expensive wealthy society looks weak vulnerable.

By contrast see SC total 50K cases 25K currently active. 700+ deaths 2000 cases one day!!!! Holy fuck. South Carolina authorities let happen??

We love US. share similar values, culture history mention fact Canada/US trade biggest world. Yet today discussion around watercooler office (which open BTW) US trends towards bewilderment collectively feel sense betrayal bigi brother south. borders closed Americans probably prolonged period time. political statement prudent public health policy. doubt find many Canadians would support opening back time soon. sucks us alternative far worse. 

The rest world part responded crisis non-partisan way followed recommendations public health experts. hard it‚Äôs rear-view mirror. couldn‚Äôt US done same? 

I remember hearing US politician something along lines ‚ÄúThe cure can‚Äôt worse disease‚Äù. wonder people feel statement now? 

Please stay safe American friends. Listen spent lifetime studying infectious diseases whose knowledge comes cable news Facebook. long-haul 3-4 months pulling together beat thing. Lol, guy bit snake oil salesman. asking requires either legislation written law socially conscious society coming together part. think going happen first? least Trump?

Banning sale something creates black market, concern here. concern millions n95 masks sold public gone healthcare order survive crisis. black market impact fact places like Walmart, home depot, etc stocks sold public instead healthcare.

And yes, every need wear mask. He's person, he's leader. leader says, ""You need wear mask"" goes around wearing mask. That's leading anyone.

Second half June first time daily new cases started trending up. assaulted drive window. pretty awesome. flexibility unmatched. time worth 10 grand hour time adds FAST. ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ Wow that's crazy, wish could test much. remember daily tests even worse today, saw news Florida almost amount tests whole country ruse!! Zaia guy let people go outside without mask Veneto covid free. people willing die cause.

nice eulogy ones wuo might die wanted go beach. Lol ‚ÄúAmericans need stay america french get hitler thing control‚Äù. would cool see EUer‚Äôs support US right now. bunch us taking serious. Mexico almost failed state. Yeah, ""why not?"" right. pin hopes like Americans doing, they're lazy selfish finance universal health care, end poverty, real contact tracing. lol brave That's true. First-world countries like Iceland afraid sick visitors coming third-world countries; they'll quarantine test everyone repeatedly. ... well want see movie time traveller dementia... want Jack black protagonist. glad someone else thinking this. It‚Äôs first 4th July I‚Äôm proud American. fact ashamed. Damn, says already feeling recovered. get vent, least hospitalized Lots envy showing comments! üòÉ think every states Attorney General deal gyms membership issues businesses. high school Missouri go 4 different chains pulling type shit. Interesting way thinking actually, true important thing notice can't compare positive rates method same.
Mexico bad, nowhere bad USA (currently country hit hard, close). Current positivity rate Mexico 45% (until two days ago, July 1st) Mexico testing people heavily sick, suspisicous enough. raises positivity rate. can't even compare state sin Mexico ones USA following: places moments tests become massive/widely available always report lower (by much) positivity rate test suspicious cases.

This added geography: USA Mexico big countries multiple inner differences transportation, population density, topography even local cultures.

A better way compare countries impact virus using cases per population (e.g. cases per million) mortality (e.g. deaths per 100k people). regard Johns Hopkins data:

USA: 39.7 dead per 100k inhabitants 8558 cases per million inhabitants.

Mexico: 22.7 dead per 100k inhabitants 1835 cases per million.

Mortality better number use despite massive tests, easier count people passing away asymptomatic cases.

And even so, Mexico better, countries whole world facing daily tragedies. Nevertheless, also important order draw better conclusions we'd analyze geographically: region starters, state idealy. Why? taking country numbers, USA horribly months ago, mainly NY Northeast. slow spread accelerating places, relatively better NY, countrywide numbers would make seem flatten curve reality multiple spikes multiple places different moments. WTF?

How even thing? part state make subject laws orders governing body state?

If legal, that's fine, think would also legal Governor send national guard make sure nobody leaves country. I'm, say American wants visit France, could visit third party country (UK?) neither US EU banned travelers from? Totally possible. I‚Äôd say owner though, pilot. private charter pilots don‚Äôt Gulfstream. Trust me. Tldr Australian story reported UK paper. caused latest uptick cases Melbourne 30k people back lockdown people wanted get laid. article doomed. Excuse hoping one many vaccines made Table 1 entire cohort patients consecutive admissions. results study.

They matched individual group another group adjusting pre-existing conditions age. cohort whole study about. instead matched groups showed significant benefit discussed table 1.

I really like prospective studies, there's lot things go wrong patient matching methodologies. However, every study HCQ prospective, least finished ones. Also prior studies mainly poor quality, many clear issues, many retracted.

I think crucial get scientific answer drug. People seem interested politics actual science. problem US spending billions drug shown double blind studies little benefit, extremely cheap medication can't even conduct proper double blind study on. utterly crazy think Europe put together accounts 1.7 million despite double population USA...part feels sorry sensible people States time 0 sympathy given behaviour I've seen Americans recent weeks.

Really nice though, lovely bike ride today. read this, NYT:

Why research teams announcing optimistic forecasts many experts skeptical even 18-month timeline? Perhaps it‚Äôs public listening ‚Äî it‚Äôs investors, too.

‚ÄúThese biotechs putting press announcements,‚Äù said Dr. Hotez. ‚ÄúYou need recognize they‚Äôre writing shareholders, purposes public health.‚Äù :) ""Even extra 2 inches."" would nicer people actually followed requirement. California many people ignore it, can‚Äôt even imagine states. Right, dilution problem seems overcome case?  Yes short term, what‚Äôs bad economy short term good long term many participated protests Chop, told didn‚Äôt report it? protests may caused spikes owing outdoors/masks, poor social modeling probably directly contributed spikes way. 


Having people gathered thousands soon lockdown ended, thumbs media dropped COVID two weeks, sent signal COVID next thing. bit hard tell someone can't birthday party saw thousands people gathered together shouting. None. freedom matters. See gorgeous face. see quite here. assume partly environmental reasons. reusable mask seems much greener... I'm still hoping people wearing masks pandemic ""minority"".

I'm also sure percentage ""stupid people"" minority not, either. No, 99% live. 

That‚Äôs ‚Äúno damage‚Äù. 

And US *significantly* less healthy populace European countries we‚Äôve comparing pandemic stats with, really really shouldn‚Äôt assume fare well. It‚Äôs reasonable question, though. dangerous take family beach 4th, perfectly fine go protest 60,000 people downtown? POOL! Sports Entertainment thriving. China perception American exceptionalism. shows China actually feels inferior bluster that. There's difference ""understand"" ""defend"" though. lot people understand it. make okay though. still pathetic way people acting this. People need grow fuck get it.

This whole thing feel endless they'd behaved first place. countries managed it. could too. instead we're supposed understand people stressed act like toddlers throwing tantrum excusable. not. think so...

But Australia let whole bunch Chinese uni students even told get around border issue universities lockdown started.

They told fly 2-3 different countries fly here.

Apparently even check previous location regardless passport nationality. Yeah, would nice timeline. 

Paradoxically, even slightly decent leadership ""war virus"" ""wear mask, protect family"" would far likely get Trump reelected opposed ""if wear mask, support me"" bullshit. 

But no, short-term narcissism comes first. even put mask Trader Joe's orange jelly sticks. Who? headlines people corona virus totally fine? Yea, get it, people 100 serious complications death. It‚Äôs news anymore. gladly take vaccine created Oxford. would hesitant get vaccine produced company government US picked develop one. increasing net worth? ... advocate censorship? 

Calm down. Need plenty students get time spread around campuses fall, bring back families. What‚Äôs percentage long term damage? percentage .1 percent athletes would? could useful cytokine storm issue cases, inflammation pathways signaling molecules used. think safe say probably one way cause cytokine storm, evidence (to knowledge) enterotoxin coronavirus infection cause cytokine storm via exact inflammatory pathway. someone evidence contrary though feel free share. Gag maggot (MAGAt) :P people practicing social distancing, wearing masks, supporting current administration anti-science, fact blame. I'm interested anything less necessary essential. SUCKAHS! Never!!!!!! also capabilities terms testing. Even badly prepared still are, lot worse back then. totally agree you. don‚Äôt cooperation, public health infrastructure, mental discipline successfully implement contact tracing US. Thus, get sick wait vaccine. Vaccine safety efficiency controls still run many years vaccine released public. wait couple months longer see problems arise time. I'm sure there's link confidence. dick, Chinese POV always people. strange part headline get hung on.

You‚Äôre absolutely right get impression Pence balls. Lol suggestion risk makes thing zero understanding. like virus personally So, anyone close die cancer.

Cancer can't bad, right? real problem. 

That's basically saying. Americans allowed enter UK Everyone Surprised far Texas list, still. Time another ouchie happened rich make fearful? 

Nothing.

They live poor neighborhoods, they're scared rioters general criminals. money scared starving. predator hunts rich? Zero. Prepare show poor apex predators look like come September. astonishing rapidly pandemic spread, despite efforts stop it. February 1st, day covid-19 first appeared front cover, World Health Organisation counted 2,115 new cases. June 28th daily tally reached 190,000. day many new cases notched every 90 minutes recorded total February 1st.

The world experiencing second wave: never got first. 10m people known infected. Pretty much everywhere registered cases (Turkmenistan North Korea not, though, like Antarctica). every country China, Taiwan Vietnam, seems able contain virus, more, Latin America South Asia, raging. Others, including United States, risk losing control or, much Africa, early phase epidemic. Europe somewhere between.

The worst come. Based research 84 countries, team Massachusetts Institute Technology reckons that, recorded case, 12 go unrecorded every two covid-19 deaths counted, third misattributed causes. Without medical breakthrough, says, total number cases climb 200m-600m spring 2021. point, 1.4m 3.7m people died. Even then, well 90% world‚Äôs population still vulnerable infection‚Äîmore immunity turns transient.

The actual outcome depends societies manage disease. news better. Epidemiologists understand stop covid-19. catch indoors, crowds, people raise voices. poor vulnerable, elderly conditions. contain virus three tactics: changes behaviour; testing, tracing isolation; and, fail, lockdowns. worse country testing‚Äîand many governments failed build enough capacity‚Äîthe fall back two. Good public health need expensive. Dharavi, slum 850,000 people Mumbai, tamed outbreak (see article).

Treatments improved, thanks research dealing patients. Although mass vaccination still months away best (see article), first therapies available. known manage disease‚Äîdon‚Äôt rush put people respirators, give oxygen early. Better treatment helps explain share hospital patients went admitted intensive care fell Britain 12% end March 4% mid late May.

And economies adapted. still suffering, course. J.P. Morgan, bank, predicts peak-to-trough decline first half year 39 economies follows around 10% gdp. workers stuck Zoom hell discovered get surprising amount done home. China Starbucks designed ‚Äúcontactless‚Äù ordering, cutting time customers spend coffee shops. Supply chains struggled run smoothly. Factories found ways stagger shifts, shield staff behind plastic change work patterns personal contact minimised.

Now nationwide lockdowns done, governments make sensible trade-offs‚Äîbanning large indoor gatherings, say allowing reopening schools shops. Sometimes, American states, loosen much reverse course. Others learn mistakes.

The problem that, without cure vaccine, containment depends people learning change behaviour. initial covid-19 panic, many becoming disenchanted resistant. Masks help stop disease, Europe America refuse wear one see emasculating or, worse, Democratic. Thorough handwashing kills virus, relapsed bad old habits? Parties dangerous young people cooped months developed devil-may-care attitude. important, months drag on, people need earn money. autumn, life moves indoors, infections could soar.

Changing social norms hard. look aids, known decades prevented safe sex clean needles. Yet 2018, 1.7m people newly infected hiv, virus causes it. Covid-19 easier talk aids, harder avoid. Wearing mask chiefly protecting others; young, fit asymptomatic asked follow tedious rules shield old infirm.

Changing behaviour requires clear communication trusted figures, national local. many people believe politicians. countries America, Iran, Britain, Russia Brazil, highest caseloads, presidents prime ministers minimised threat, vacillated, issued bad advice seemed interested political fortunes country‚Äîsometimes once.

Covid-19 least. vulnerable afraid go innovation slow, creating 90% economy consistently fails reach potential. Many people fall ill die. may lost interest pandemic. lost interest you. Here‚Äôs thing: guy terrible health went bar hundreds patrons there. guy didn‚Äôt get traveling: got traveling poor decision making. sound inferior Chinese. think there's magical incantation.

I think thing happened last time, happened time. 

You think Abbot something he's never done grow conscience. Hard agree. Standing lone rock surrounded boiling lava. Exactly. President Mexico idiot there's way defend President US different him, yet (some) Americans can't understand position criticising rest world country also falling apart. Increased 1 million cases 5 days. Last million took 6 days, 7 days that. either short term. either attempt save economy, attempt save lives. later help quell virus, maintained long enough, economy falter.

Or tell everyone work. we're seeing that's working out. economy die us. government.

I would say probably equally severe. There's less fat people Wuhan. ironic, guys screaming dont want first. I'm sure understand first, kind weird flex?

And we're even bad Houston/Austin yet. 

The next month going collapse, sure. Exactly!  Even turn GPS tracking, cellular network still knows approximately (and who) else signal. IMEI number SIM card enough say least whose phone is. fallen constantly past currenly lowest point since March.

If level deaths beginning pandemic (like Europe), I'd days ""good news, soon"". actually, looking chart.      
Yesterday = 687 deaths
March 29 = 501 deaths.

Only last 2 days March higher deaths.        
Also, yes curve falling slow word ""steady"" inappropriate. took 1 month go 1000 500. took 5 days March go 500 1000...   perfect example media writing reality you.

Wow... Literally one said anything weight brought up. Maybe stop projecting insecurities outwards.

And beyond that, weight probably reason died. That's fact. ""disrespectful,"" identifying obvious, different story 80-year-old died. There's clear reason COVID killed him, he's obese.

I'm sorry discussing poor health honestly hurts fees, going make less vulnerable disease pretend like problem.  Sorry stupid question, easily identify AMP link?

Covidiots Trump time traveler. knew Covid coming dementia forgot name it. Joe Rogan: ""There's good argument made comedians essential workers"" - Actual fucking quote get people ignore this. everyone exact rates testing/cases/deaths, US would still significantly cases deaths western country far populous western country. 

Not say we've handled properly. haven't. failed test discipline long time ago. Well said. Probably like 1-2 rich, rest posse/models hanging Expensive insurance. key characteristics looking Table 1 study: 

Median age HCQ group 18 years younger, patients HCQ group twice likely receive steroids (since shown provide mortality benefit severe COVID), 44% less likely SOFA score baseline (meaning group receive HCQ severe organ damage baseline, independently correlated greater mortality). 

The findings neat, retrospective chart review without strong design, aren‚Äôt impactful. don‚Äôt think even suggest consider HCQ patients COVID, given previously released stronger prospective data showing negative cardiac outcomes high number confounders reported authors. There‚Äôs really, really sweet satisfaction knowing wealthy dickbags couldn‚Äôt buy way something once. express surprise, surprise irrelevant. expressed concern. tell us current US excess deaths year done already. 

I really doubt people suddenly dying fatal dildo accidents (though honestly since US keeps proving stunningly retarded is, nothing would surprise point.) Uhhh...no shit? Didn‚Äôt exactly need Instagram coronavirus tracking app tell us that, look national headlines past weeks. thought Hell town desert time period bible written. run people enemies people wrote bible (thus treated badly visiting) different belief system people wrote bible decided make synonymous everything wrong horrible. documentary back documentaries facts? lot asians getting hate stop adding cause chinese need STRONGLY consider mandatory microchipping point. end everyone isolating arrested convicted bioterrorism.

Absurd. lived 550 partner dog fine... antibody tests NYC showed 10 1 ratio time, math sake let's say historical ratio 10 one right 6 1.

Let's also say 40 percent, 150 million, country give US enough herd immunity slow significantly. say 150 million percentage country rather rural turtled up, let's also say 30 million arguments sake. 150 million infected

Since 30 million infected far, means need 120 million still need infected get 150 million.

60,000 daily cases time 6 = 360,000 people getting infected day.

120 million divided 360,000 = 333 days, Memorial Day next year.

I proponent strategy ALL. IFR .5% talking 750,000 dead. looking 30,000 dead month final resolutions.

Not mention estimate long term health effects probably around 2 percent, couple million people going permanent health issues.

All swag math course. could 100,000 confirmed cases day two weeks, could lock drive 20,000 cases. could get vaccine January, might available summer original 18 month timeline holds.

A lot debate anti-maskers, people claiming first amendment violations, flu people - fall 30% category. massive amount population even aware bad is... lifestyle one involves waking up, going work, watching shitty tv shows going bed. 

A perfect example, parents retired dad would considered extremely well educated(even rich peoples terms) go help every two weeks since bought new house last october. Watching evolution awareness understanding whats unfolding described disturbing.. I've update several times concerned warnings.

Spending 3 day weekend house without break normal routine like another planet. TV never news except morning coffee bullshit gives quick numbers COVID take effort change TV shitty sitcom major news outlets update quickly.. would seem like nothing really happening outside world.

Its scary honestly... know better explain without others outside USA chiming in.. Elon Musk Californian Donald Trump What? mean, *they* could stopped it! they, ask? China, (I think?) vaccine absolutely nothing malaria meds. made adenovirus causes common cold chimpanzees cannot replicate humans. Onto harmless virus, ""spike protein"" SARS-COV-2 grafted. spike protein similarly cannot replicate own, part virus antibodies target. antibody locked spike, virion cannot enter cell neutralized. 

So basically harmless non-replicating sniffles virus carrying ""dress rehearsal"" non-replicating spike proteins immune system learn recognize neutralize.

Yes people serious effects, seems level occasional anecdote.

There people ongoing health issues (shortness breath, etc.) hasn‚Äôt long enough know whether that‚Äôs something resolve within year so. (I pneumonia years ago took year completely resolve. know that‚Äôs going C19 cases.)

This stuff makes great fearmongering useless decision making pretty much ignore it. Telling people: 1) mass gatherings protests okay 2) still terrified virus requires astonishing level doublethink. Two diametrically opposed concepts.

You easily agree cause racial equality also realize since real President, last hope reliable media blew it. Even protests cause large viral spread, undoubtedly influenced individual behavior.

Even vaccine rushed, far safer contracting coronavirus. I'll take 1 million chance something going seriously wrong 1 100 chance. issue is, time vaccine, late country. current rate infection continues, expect 3/4 citizens time vaccine available (assuming CDC's estimate infection rates 10-11 times higher recorded). 

The virus harder time spreading enough people contracted recovered though. sad truth don‚Äôt see bad comments negative news. gets spinned see Fox.  called weed. Legalize it. stigmatize it. covid? decent customer pays fees? Nobody asked pandemic. agree that. Hmm... Indeed disagree. hospital entered crisis mode yesterday surge new covid patients UBI feds legal matter? Test positivity rates remain fairly stable, ranging 10 13%. 

I'd think low prevalence antibodies likely explanation summer many people holiday spending time outdoors. new cell theory weak point time. One Swedish research fairly scathing critique it: simply think possibility investigate 13 exposed individuals lacking antibodies, include, cell responses unexposed someone specific cells, doesnt constitute ""vara immun"". Especially antibodies cold coronas also induce strong good cell responses. dont protect re-infection year get sense Karolinska cell study go similar direction Stanford serological survey: quite lot early hype later turns unfounded. science. individual community. Á¨ëÊ≠ªÊàë‰∫Ü ÂìàÂìàÂìàÂìàÂóù Correct, ""tamed second wave"" utter BS describe couple hundred cases. folks like us, benefits vaccine clearly outweigh risks. doesn‚Äôt mean doubts vaccine‚Äôs efficacy wholly without merit. things simultaneously true. epidemic: opiates?

Obviously tho, people going Vegas arent *just* going go pools likely also crowding inside there. read responses im full support masks, im explaining US incapable learning mistakes unfortunately enough idiots keep virus spreading, leader incapable actual leadership care American lives. vaccine come, tbh reason taking long **is** go correct facets testing regardless rushing not. Scientists learned mistakes creating polio vaccine. also important note since pandemic epidemic, Scientists working versions vaccine across globe (which good thing). way stop states herd immunity promise definitely want (just look UK example dangerous mindset is) That‚Äôs told him, fears get fired/punished since ordered work. told it‚Äôs better get reprimanded feel weight potential consequences. caring roommate it‚Äôs likely he‚Äôs contaminated.

What say though I'm dreamer.  Man, seems like it‚Äôs much complicated process aware of. Thanks clarification. We're number 1, we're number 1, we're numb.. wait minute far year 8,500 gun homicides; 20,000 gun deaths, 255 mass shootings, 16,500 injuries firearm misuse: probably summer months get vitamin therefore immune system stronger think that's entire point behind lockdown first place - prevent disease spreading exponentially destroying economy. 

Unfortunately, trump thought disease would disappear like miracle, do. Bars easy blame.

However, standard, garden variety office probably biggest culprit.

People back work. People sitting desks, 30 people room recirculating air, probably without masks on. filled conference room without masks on. Sorry bother, curious: place get scholarly updates (showing results methodology) vaccines COVID-19 rather tabloid like sites? short time numbers comparatively low, major cities shut-downs mask orders effect.   

It turns testing, State lying deaths, Governor cancelled orders. It‚Äôs top comment hours you. original are. I‚Äôm sorry logical rational person accept information earlier less reliable information later.

You blame CDC earlier misfires, rational person clearly see masks way forward. Anyone refuses rational. one way find out! ...lauded?

To put context, according numbers Germany UK combined accept 1.06 million immigrants per year, US. US double population, making impact immigrants much smaller.  wealthy.

Houston Medical Center said 300 extra ICU beds prepared surge capacity. anyone wondering many ICU nurses takes cover 300 beds, answer 1260. human beings cannot work 24/7, ICU nurses full time work 40 hour per week, takes 4.2 nurses keep one ICU patient alive around clock. reality, that, need extra staff cover sick leave, waiting swab results etc. make one nurse cover two ICU beds patients critical condition likely die result. deeply humbled awards given post. Thank you, whoever are, honoring doctor. disagree main point, 6 week vacation.

It's twice long. Restrictions started mid-March. Good technical innovations happened US. People come startups. Look Amazon, Tesla, spaceX, Apple. Tell company outside well known. 

Yes, education healthcare great.

How social media's fault average person cretin, means spreading thoughts around people likeminded cretins?

And necessarily blame cretins either. simply failing system looks like. Poor education, corruption, cretins, connected other, amplifying cretinism, repeat collapse. everybody probably stored matter status is. everything wrong way. still use inches pounds lanes go right direction. Canada Day came went. Beautiful day. leave house. Idiots. guess that, unlike rest us Americans, see news clearly states allowed travel several countries. glad Italy stood them.

Though really understand blocking based citizenship. non-Americans came US plane full Americans, permitted stay quarantine 14 days Americans couldn't? rules based country flight originated well. I'm going disagree buddy. personally good friends military pretty determined. go orders still go public without mask. Idk define discipline me, that's it. problem situations imagine them: happen time. hear people charge job. goes away even gets attention. sometimes hear (eg: swine flu), crazy big deal. 


When fail though, there's pandemic, there's war, there's riots...and failed get judged let happen first place, get judged handle fallout failures. say ""well folks happen them!"". No, prevented happen all. 


It's politics. Every people, people trades, parents, name it. shit happens everywhere. Guter Ansatz! :) seems update Google services framework phones, something pushed phone manufacturers carriers. Everyone probably received device internet connectivity. Okay. What? said gobbledygook.

The protestors tested COVID. 

Those tests would count people asymptomatic. 

They didn‚Äôt ask people sick. 

They gave COVID tests. 

;) It‚Äôs tough family. partner bosses starting talk along lines accepting us childcare excuse work. It‚Äôs lack effort either. places aren‚Äôt open accepting new kids. September going big challenge. always case ways, special rule UK negotiated years ago. Ireland exception share bed dad? think USA‚Äôs high case count result inability take rules guidelines seriously? Marches usually hundred people near 100% wearing masks.

Cops event (ready beat snot peaceful people)? 0% masks worn.

Meanwhile MILLIONS beaches, gyms, clubs, parties, restaurants masks. 

I think reality checks needed.

Don't forget ""protests"" end quarantine open businesses. Thousands people claiming COVID hoax, 5G alien babies, nonsense. masks...and plenty reports people getting COVID.  What's ironic think everyone *wearing* masks ""sheeple"". backwards. One conspiracy-theorist video Facebook later they're suddenly experts Coronavirus know 90% medical professionals. Remember Corey Lewandowski said ""[womp back ya, America. I'm somewhere foreign remember even kid parents would say ""if anyone asks us Canada"" wear mask penis... ""She'll right, mate!"" (A common phrase stupid Aussie's say.) Deaths per day USA way month two ago justify current hysteria Shit.

Why never stated coronavirus guidelines??? Great strategy. always opposite tell them.  No. got rich-told. see article, rich governor wil go bat you. Also, want bring past events cast judgement groups people, Germans 100% biggest assholes based logic? Extermination group people. Horrific experiments mutilations people. Imperialism likes Great Britain. 

O right, consider b/c past event clearly happen more. want blame politicians also remember voted group people decidedly wanted you. agree everything said. die exhaustion disease. people years medical knowledge would passed generations med students. healthcare system damaged years pandemic ends. Sucks bust U go back home read article clearly states US resident step foot Italy. Waste money.. live Rochester upstate new york. Compliance everything actually good. 95% mask compliance stores, get alot dirty looks/kicked places without them. expected slight bump cases socializing increased. expected increase, said sure Cuomo local leaders clamp cases continue rise. nurse part local covid task force awhile. really feel good grip this. need ban travel south lol Yeah, like wrote above, release follow-up testing numbers. 2630 tests includes tests given clear people could leave hospital. actual positivity rate new patients likely much higher. friend hunch racist. said something like ""white hispanic oxymoron, can't hispanic white"" years ago.

right around 2015-2016 confirmed Facebook: racist dogwhistles everywhere, following well-known racists, etc. Das mane. Upstate issue. got real crazies there, unfortunately. Folks say ""Public schools meant day cares"", but, right wrong, truth is:
 schools properly reopen, cannot return business usual."" Ya rich people get away murder theft time US, whole different ballgames them. time rich people face consequences hurt rich people. Jesus... shows serious everyone must take virus. Online find countless testimonies people thought nothing special, got themselves.

No, probably die, becoming severely ill one wants. we're even talking potential long-term damage.

We must listen people like friend. It‚Äôs still blog-y but: lol expect don‚Äôt believe you. hey, never going adjust cultural biases anyways bothering? way around, dude. corporations evil. Hence whole Bill Gates thing. Governments stupid that. wouldn‚Äôt. last place Residence US Again, population density.
A country like Sweden lot less densely populated example Germany. compare cases per capita look capita per km¬≤ see huge difference success rate.
One country shut public life slowly getting back normal country kept everything running hoped best.
Or want even easier comparison.
Sweden Norway. One shut down, one numbers, although similarly big countries, highly different (total numbers per capita).

I'm saying Europeans good solid, hell I'm Swedish I'm fan ""our"" crisis politics ever, looking overall success rate countries went lockdown, compared countries either (Sweden) later others (UK) decided lockdown (ish) I'd dare say numbers cautious countries. I'm worried we're rushing I'm waaay worried catching horrible fucking virus bring on. Lol basically ‚Äúgo back shithole country‚Äù? Thrump golfing, someone include daily brief Timelines say fall 2020/early 2021 Let know find DJ play song loop. US purchased everyone there. /s Toddlers Difficult test places test aged 10 above. decide get tested, make sure able test kids. I‚Äôd hate make trip ER nothing. 

In mean time assume positive. Stay well hydrated. Kids often won‚Äôt eat drink. Make fruit smoothies using Pedialyte liquid. Monitor urine output color ensure hydration adequate. people still try migrate illegally Mexico, wonder? totally see Trump somehow trying spin win anti-immigration crowd. That's pretty shit them. hear 2k subpoena fine didnt answer inspired truth honesty. 

However speaking husband bought point - couldnt say protest? dont ask protests avoid follow questions. Obviously dont know everyone large protest even question posed hospitalized/positive patients also missing large demographic contributing spread addition obvious house party/covid party/july 4th coming party spreaders?

This discount protests necessary - think cant pick choose want contact trace want seriously taken all. especially areas may chance contain (bye bye FL, AZ Tx) would really help. Ten bucks says there‚Äôs article people going Lake Tahoe Sunday agree. also stops rich connected criminals leaving country. See: Ghislaine Maxwell Anything possible year! Please cite percentage people experiencing this? guess almost negligible. I'm super confused, mean ""stop police rioting"" ""have police prevent rioting""? pertinent wearing masks? guess enforcement? kind shit cost Trump presidency lol  Lots people do.

We one blame ourselves. China started air also mixed evaporating chlorine-laden moisture? Thats also diluted large body water? Again, probably possible, likely? people swimming actually spitting water mouths people beside them, im still worried it. lot ifs maybes lot misinformation floating around, pun intended, I'm going defer experts CDC. say safe proper distancing preventative measure taken, im going agree that. Don‚Äôt worry- won‚Äôt get much worse daily- beginning plateau now..... testing capacity imagine thinking greatest country history planet still comparing actual bombed third world countries ravaged decades regional unrest. countries systematically exploited foreign powers topple governments steal resources. retarded? Finally, know ""covfefe"" meant always buddy  Meathead gonna say meathead things. Going gym health, vanity, many people. lockdown certainly made less healthy. used able deadlift 450#+. Now, idea likely closer ~350#. 

I still run 5 miles every day maintain healthy heart weight, weaker matters. Strength important, especially age.

That said, coronavirus (probably, age--30) bigger health risk losing ton muscle. politically savvy mayor: ""*I* would let in, Rome says..."" Clever, clever man. mean, people limbs amputated needed lung transplants. think confidently consider lifetime tolls, unless willing argue limbs could grow back...? Seriously major lol saw notification GET AWAY Nope. Dallas Woman Coronavirus waiting Google. write everything off. That‚Äôs... that‚Äôs totally different discussion. don‚Äôt really pay taxes way do. [laughs norwegian] I've lived whole life US refused address COVID19 seriously, 

This hilariously ignorant statement. 95% actions taken governors, local governments, health care leadership know care it.

Oh. course, that's ""think"" this. People really need quit believing everything tv, reddit, twitter, facebook tell aligns confirmation bias.  Typical rich folk.

Go back read original comment, one promoted hateful, foam mouthed psychosis. absolutely mentally ill. Press details.

My co-worker got married early April. bride refused reschedule.

The wedding live streamed Zoom. ""Let eat shit"" article say anything. take volunteers? many days testing.

If volunteers, people volunteered probably noticed symptoms went get tested. represent asymptomatics well. Moving pandemic equally retarded. friend pilots private jets, allowed tell us flies (and never has). However, said many zero concept money waste. flown special kitchen sink across United States private jet, going delivered fast enough clients. flew golden retriever across United States human occupants, decided wanted dog right away summer home. 

Just think that. Money aside (and cost many tens thousands dollars fly dog whim private jet), people care little anybody world would waste huge amount energy emissions quickly move fucking dog around.

I mean we, Thai, test many test per capita still double Japanese positive rate 0.5%. 
While Japan positive rate around 4% (US 6%). 


I follow situation Japan Japan really safe ? coz number wise, feel way. think closing restaurants back 'to go' would best too. anyone see happening again? Less tests less cases, right?

But said...this says little FDA, got LOT problems lot distrust too.

In part last decades, things like, one example, person working company, quitting joining FDA happening get position giving approval something company submitting FDA...and quitting FDA within year two getting better paying job back company. that's suspicious.

Also lots people tend hang bars four hours longer. put stop payment assholes March could stay locked years needed. could tax rich, government could work people offer relief slashing spending avenues. Corporations could operate skeleton crews, allowing others work home. Essential business could determined regulated boards monitored CDC compliance via agencies like OSHA, everything else shutters consistent relief government.There options lunacy rest world finding success in, weve convinced stay open money. government needs move funds help people now, dont need economy up. need stay alive. Never left Firefox. Never saw point. ahh yes, elective ICU surgeries. want skip proper trial phases go full mass vaccination (see thalidomide example things go horribly wrong).

For [Oxford vaccine](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-05-22-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-begin-phase-iiiii-human-trials): 

* [Phase](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-04-23-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-begins-human-trial-stage) one \~1,110 \*healthy\* adults age 18-55, half received actual vaccine
* [Phase UK expanded 10K \*healthy\* participants increased age groups 5-12 years, 56-69, 70, receiving actual vaccine control (I assume half)

Phase 1 &amp; 2 exclusion criteria included: "" pregnant, intending become pregnant, breastfeeding study"" also previously testing positive virus.

I see age/etc. criteria listed Brazil study, 5K participants.

Assuming half groups get actual vaccine, that's \~8k data points healthy people, usually considered sufficient evidence say need give billions people.

You want give everyone find 3 months kills half people AIDS condition. causes birth defects, etc.

Or spend untold billions time vaccinating everyone find confers immunity healthy people, like trial groups.

This disease damaging elderly and/or health issues also likely ones impacted there's major yet unknown side-effect vaccine. 

So need slowly expand clinical trial criteria include people, well different sexes, ethnicities, pregnant, etc. Congess currently working ""vacation incentive"" get interstate tourism back up. 50% vacation would reimbursed, $4k. that's higher priority actually helping people survive this. 

Fucking disgusting. That's hope, think timeline safe effective vaccine anywhere October-March. think midpoint likely, December/January. weird trust foreign university make trustworthy vaccine anything US would produce. ""We pox we're fine!"" 

That's pretty much definition selection bias. fine, around say anything. hand sanitizer requirement one new updates, relevant topic denying new update rules. least admit requirement also? It‚Äôs depressing. thing count Oxford. expensive even insurance bit old, understanding US expect roughly 300M doses end 2020, UK 100M.

Distribution tough part. vaccinate entire population? vaccine immediately effective. catch covid place receive vaccination, get sick without protection. winter, transmissions might skyrocket.

Clinics pharmacies set outdoor vaccination lines, plenty ventilation. What‚Äôs gonna make money quarter? ""With information. all. get amber alerts fairly often unfortunately.

 big bomb ""people wearing masks"". mince words, suggest people make homemade face coverings....he flat said people wear mask. even said sly smirk face, mocking people wore them.

The whole ""They wanted save healthcare workers"" argument bullshit opinion. early stages hospitals even allowing masks purchased open retail markets. government could stepped redirect shipments hospitals...while encouraging people use homemade ones.

It's like early medical professionals claiming HcQ dangerous - we've using drug 70 years, administering millions doses year globally, limited well-known side effects. small chance danger patients specific heart conditions known since 80s never considered significant enough forbid administration recently, why? makes sense. title also read ""After testing positive Covid-19 Brendan Schaub decided quarantine, wear mask, exposing people virus.""

It's actually worse that.

Cabana fits 10. many cabanas occupied people live household? Close up, drinking, laughing, breathing air rest teh cabana entire day. 

Yes, slightest breeze helps, sure yet dosage breathe order infected. 

Passing someone street breathing air? Low risk.

Sitting bar pr restaurant 2 hours breathing air people around you? High risk.

Sharing cabana day people living home? Somewhere between.

See, significant fraction persons immune responses, exposure, complicates immunity question even further. could something asymptomatic infections, severity symptoms. 

So guessing game value R0. also fraction persons immune, already. Sorry let rephrase flu shot says covid produce false positive Influenza test. believes already tested positive influenza year. Yeah don‚Äôt really take stop gap lmao.

For first weekend like 2/3 months I'm going launch kayak go fishing. Unless get negative result back. I'm 95 percent sure COVID risky situations I've funnily enough gas stations kayaking get cold Gatorade/water. even grocery store restaurant. Wore mask anytime went indoors.

I runny nose, light cough felt fatigued past week. physical yesterday Dr ordered test. physical 1030, hung telecall emailed test order. 12:45 leaving testing site surprised quick was. (Pinellas CO, FL) Dr said taking 3 days results know buy that. 

Lesson learned. Get better cooler bring drinks me. really need drink avoid gas stations hot zip codes.

Sorry ramble I'm bored live alone anyone talk to. bought Dragon Age: Inquisition Steam started playing weekend ain't seen nothing yet.

Zombies want brains.

Be Hero, Zombie stay home 4th. give madness. Cases thankfully deaths staying low

We increased testing. seems like doctors learning fight even really Lockdown level! Anyone 50 needs sheltering place FL. chances encountering asymptomatic covid positive randomly store Starbucks probably 50/50 now. Anybody brain could seen coming months ago What? flat lying order try preserve bizarre conspiracy theory days? Putin desperate?

Take five days show symptoms, another 7-10 hospitalised 21 days die symptom onset. 26 exposure. takes week two death notifications happen. means positive test death shows official data 4-5 weeks. seeing beginning death spike ( ) exactly expected. would care Trump president? fucked entire thing Covering Curica like many times see headline 2020 shit ants start taking fucking pandemic seriously? It‚Äôs completely recycled point, literally every hot spot WORLD doctors say exact thing Another good part news appears vaccines may effective original variant SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant taking now. people would vote, elections would become multi day process, GOP would lose Presidency Senate.

Lmao ~$2,500 per flight hour general rule thumb. sure long flight is. 10 hours? $25k maybe. you‚Äôre group everyone going book premium flights commercial carrier starts sorta make sense financially. got charged every month closed.  know... exagerating :) thinking is, makes sense? reality quarter population vulnerable. 

Also, tend read discussion death qualification moot. excess deaths year simply somewhat related happening year? inform policy action, maybe greater need understand trends, get sense impact thus far, seems quite obvious excess death / excess death + covid related. free wheeling opinions. Texans need strap rough month more. quarantines going taking place? Depends jet - traveling non-stop Colorado (which story doesn‚Äôt confirm imply) 10 passengers would require heavy super heavy-class private jet. Likely Gulfstream g5 6 series, Global 7000. Looking easily 5-6k/hr operating costs, usually translates 12-15k/hr passengers. 14 hours Italy, likely 150-200k chartered. like 15-20k pp, easily. 

A person‚Äôs wealth common sense aren‚Äôt always equally proportioned. Lucky you, got smashed indica one. da couch whole quarantine [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/jLrIf) Damn miss dimsum. Sounds like win win me. quote Reddit using front sentence.

I get point is, apparently thinking know better experts right right dealing it. 

And yes seen quote actual source Dutch situation, link posted Netherlands. fairly common notion government responded slow, current situation working fine based current test results death rates. find astounding WoW used model medical economic studies. mandated warning, light fine, possibility enforcement plausible even worry paying fine. it? must got mixed. Either way, new types vaccines lot promise safety proven vaccines velesk claimed were. Obviously it'd great use adenovirus vaccines diseases (cancer main research target topic) yet proven. Statistically, 1900 sample small size all.

I read entire article judge probably based number, claim valid. empathy know like 5 minutes research well known threat ones health. insight ignorant. similar antivaxxers, understand either. friggin hard get unbiased information anyways?

Nobody put position - US. agree stupid. guess response is: freedom ends life begins. Plus bullshit. ever seen Dark Knight Rises? Nobody manly Bane. Worth noting studies getting underway cases, still new phenomenon. Surviving need kidney lung transplants really great outcome. People taking seriously getting infected first place is.  I‚Äôm still holding hope suicidally willful ignorant assholes get solid year die great numbers vaccine makes rounds.

Eh, yes, can, actually. dismiss everything creationism related hand, science, exactly seriousness study published multiple outlets surprising results. Sorry im excited immediately dismiss trump something. 

If read actual articles, would've known severely flawed 'study', instead acting like I'm one politicizing, know exactly is, another brainfart personality cult around Anyway it‚Äôll likely amount nothing big headline drug people would least reasonable it

People perfectly reasonable it, not. Huh. wider program trigger? Phone close proximity 150 others=shrieking alarm overrides mute settings mask/social distancing reminder. Hard livestream friends drinking dancing setting incendiaries July 4th block party phone keeps shouting you.

If would excuse American slang moment fact dumb fuck son 

Litteraly people literally thinking end world put mask year 2 trump take pandemic seriously alot people taking seriously either

Take job example

I work golf course, work outside maintaining grounds self day required wear mask, wore one month lock lifted tend work distane one another really point wearing one 

The golfers hand tend wear mask even they're close quarters reason

Now I'm going talk family neighbors planning throw annual 4th July block party every year happens mom offered let anyone swim pool please possibly let come inside house 

I asked mom good idea fucking even party literally look said ""why be"" know mom I'm little worried fucking global pandemic I've hearing kind like want die watch love ones die well We're going see whole lot Darwinism work near future. would seem pass smell test. 

However, I'd think would mean recent efforts may carrying risk reason. I'm knowledgeable assess it. 

I'm watching trials go honest would probably take vaccination without waiting years see goes. Cases going seems like rules need apply everyone. Seems things get worse. problem many people wait late get treatment. post recently cases Rio Grande Valley, many folks far gone died almost immediately arriving hospital. Others died home. going happen many Texans health insurance. Exactly... decisions stay open could result loss life.  know put people profits... silly Thsnks god I'm mice, I'm safe I'm biased since already got it, know statistically right. part wants say, ""Hey, begging catch shit.

Thats saw anti-trump friends start ignore quarantine. Yikes. Border security even theater thought. literally people surprised subject laws normally live life laws even brought first place.... nothing look besides Instagram news, would never know pandemic.

Is like dont wear masks anything, many people use public transportation packed there, im guessing new cases come there, people go family parties everything spreads way.

The federal government hiding numbers doesnt help either, 670 new deaths 6700 new cases? Mortality 2%! Biological terrorists Today got groceries, need start online orders again, bet 85 percent people masks store. Three weeks ago would 15 20 percent maybe something sticking. sure legally much states enforce/ isolate No, ppl read headlines articles probably should. Go read second half article really lousy tip. know media saying exact opposite, right treat americans criminals let immigrants africa come freely homes...

Maybe, America still paying this, human lives, can't bought back. Trump stable genius. He's narcissistic TV personality, clue get us this. proven absolutely fucking idea do, he's chosen ignore it, literally killing country. every developed western county seems figured out.

Speculatively, could things like setting activities leaving residents enter room, cleaning leave, mealtimes, tidying/cleaning residents rooms etc. would still leave lot risk cross contamination risk transmission. It‚Äôs median age infected lower+treatment protocols improved significantly, we‚Äôre ventilating much found early ventilation doesn‚Äôt really help  Hmm isn‚Äôt clear, months ago medical professionals told public masks don‚Äôt help.

People need held accountable that. It‚Äôs impossible.

People act like everything black white virus. It‚Äôs pretty clear don‚Äôt know shit point know? made America great again, like back early days federal government weak state acted independently.

Week 25 12,5% think last week 10,8%

It‚Äôs good see. 

Interestingly Sk√•ne, region one lowest test rates per capita Sweden, 5,5% positive tests.

It work. Eventually someone going get tested they've contracted virus, catch way airport, terms later transmission case counts high.

That relates main problem everywhere, even without re-entry closed areas concern. reason people seem ""super-spreaders,"" normal patterns contact transmission always play out; sometimes worse. resorts problem single working staff could potentially infect insane number people. dropping tourism themes long term seem like option, different places need figure work-arounds like that, deal exceptions.

They put personal tracking place here; mention that, check-in check-out steps malls restaurants. largely ignored now, never necessary, set right around time infections stopped, close end. kind thing might partial solution, puts extra demand people keep scanning places, given would really work well trace back isolate exposure patterns.

The final tally. Eh, seems still eating (modestly) continuing list celebrity. Well aren‚Äôt supposed go get closer God anyway? Nothing seems certain. recently saw testing results US speculated maybe 20% people disease far. course one could know, extrapolating data, checking confirmed cases sampled test results. 

If 80% people US still could get it, herd immunity really kicking three fourths do, pandemic could carry US least another year, getting lot worse gets better. people could re-infected different strains worst case nightmare, although seems likely getting similar disease versions would less dangerous.

All ""herd immunity"" premise seem help much ""only"" 20% population disease.

In worst case treatment, testing, vaccine developments fail improve (which seems unlikely) Thailand could faced never completely re-opening embracing high chance renewed pandemic. Maybe world could split ""bubbles"" countries contacting restrict corona spread don't. likely kinds solutions emerge, vaccines such, rest year could messy interim. unions able negotiate that. problem they're treating violations law they're employment disciplinary issues. Crimes crimes one law. I‚Äôll say... 3 weeks. Semi-wild guess. Hopefully I‚Äôm wrong never gets bad. COVID still hit harder countries around strict guidelines.

It though sort comparative statistical significance. Yes, hit hard, moreso nations stricter guidelines 

And likely done pandemic. argumentative consistency, can't say certainty another weeks, I'll damned graph deaths time indicate they've stabilized level COVID like actually indifferentiable common flu terms fatalities

I'll take word he's smart guy. reasoning seems fly face rest medical experts. ok generation people lung damage? parents would fly grandparents India every year watch us summer grandparents got permanent residency. ""Most Americans well equipped alter beliefs light new evidence.""

That works ways, know. If, next months, let's say hypothetically, death rate declined precipitously IFR turned way lower originally thought, think people sub would go ""Welp, guess wrong. Turns way less lethal thought.""

I think so. *Who take responsibility raising next generation?* ~ Ruth Bader Ginsburg

This generation?? thanks. one protests riots.. supposed done first wave. hitting record cases daily seems.

We also hitting record low numbers daily Covid deaths.

There fewer people dying Covid time since issue it‚Äôs fully contained bubble. whatever reason, Disney resort employees bubble DeSantis stood next Pence earlier basically said big deal Florida actually well flattening curve. ... Who? source that? Pretty much reason still much visit sub often due seeing updates Oxford one. remember friend talking India they'd push people bus, cramming in. get in. said America people would said 1/2 people got bus. pressed people bus ride, big deal India. fact, daily life lot. Italy. India, that's are. 


I think they've done decent job far, young population, I'm hoping best. Oh god. state Australia (Victoria) losing shit week 50-75 cases per day. hate trump fan Cain, read comment pretend saw T_d talking someone left. would think comment? local sheriff outside Asheville, NC said officers even governors mandate people Reddit downvote weirdest shit, especially sub. personally never understand it. checked FOX news app, mention nothing mandate coronavirus news 8th headline.

Seriously, sue people mass murdering? TL;DR financial collapse incoming Absences evidence evidence absence.... Oxford vaccine given thousands volunteers UK already based old vaccine around years.

Thousands healthy people, yes.

Phase [three](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-05-22-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-begin-phase-iiiii-human-trials) trial includes unhealthy people they've chosen continent Africa perform type testing.

And there's reason Africa Brazil chosen Phase 3. also don‚Äôt think question vaccine made available Africa elsewhere would benefit most. developed distributed profit basis affordable developing countries too.

You sound white understand history go, ""Well, we're going fuck anyone first time! seems unreasonable beku us say we've turned new leaf."" think trying avoid panic. 

Not sure why, maybe preparations surge lot better implied couple weeks ago. *Who take responsibility raising next generation?* ~ Ruth Bader Ginsburg

This generation?? thanks. Anatoly turning hips like they‚Äôre double agents, keeping one foot touching mother Russia times. Idk actually pretty happy heard may elementary go back classes would less 10 kids(they actually shooting 5). make way less worried sending 5 year old kindergarten year! scientist see politically motivated? agree worth studying. listed six things. Six! rocket surgery.

We've many months, already paid costs measured $T, going away time soon.

Now killed Americans major wars, reason largest economy world putting existential war type dollars behind now. Winning guys, amirite? Except trying everything else first takes hundred years. We're still long ways off. Sorry, assumed implying fault protests. asymptomatic people getting [2 3 months worth infection, think herd immunity wont possible without vaccine. high schools already bring wrecked cars sit front school show potential impaired driving. still effective. ITT real Scott-heads. mean you‚Äôre opening state pools might well allow residential buildings open theirs. Many, many nyc them. Surely less people go private ones state ones (even buildings could restrict residents without guests).

But also: rooftop bars city pools? guess restaurants outdoor dining well also restaurants.

Why can‚Äôt open? Everybody consuming outdoors anyway

Food thought would. new strain. ‚Äònew strain‚Äô reported today around since March strain spread Europe America. deadly original strain.

Also: super aware dangers virus take every single precaution still admit odds absolutely favor anyone gets virus. single demographic higher likelihood dying living contract covid. doesn‚Äôt minimize risk, realistic. Oh god, let rinse eyes out! came negativity! /s Alright, Texas done it. 

No state excuses now. New Disney World tagline: Mickey, Covid, You! ... pot's light sad average person never get hold power. much reliable ways mitigate cytokine storms without infecting harmful parasite. Like various classes steroids immune-suppressant drugs.

The problem studying whether countries parasites lower covid mortality rates, countries third world, going see good hospital care good identification covid cases all. data shit. Yeah. COVID outlier regard, kids general pools infection will, blows over. shop going burn ""under suspicious circumstances"" ASM gonna charged arson. Because, know, cops prove they're criminals law. cant florida adopt model? understand parents need sitters, force kids 12 older back? teach chemistry job fine 100% remote. Florida trying go full apocalypse us.

10000 cases per DAY. People social distancing. executive order wear masks. People world travel interact.

Nope. Nothing see folks. herd immunity

That's lot ~~damage~~ death. addition everyone else said, government paid untested unproven companies sprang nowhere source supplies. significantly supplies months ago, millions dollars. twice population Florida. Guess forget works political agenda push. can‚Äôt figure fall column column B.

Yes, exactly! frustrates end. people take want speak you? Jeez reach herd immunity two million Americans died this.

It would better vaccine first actually think might push self-destruct button blame people. afterall knew along virus capable always thought masks good idea.. people listen?! Uhh goes foodies come job Milwaukee Chicago pie. Like go home thought smarter.  Obama‚Äôs Ebola lethal.

But it‚Äôs lethality likely caused admin jump got bad. cool this?! probably frustrating thing work far? point we're toughing going herd immunity guess. do, thanks populous

off topic, ""populace"". Cities _populous_, _populace_ stupid. read felt like interviewer meant Fauci personally losing common sense battle rest administration skipping lot important pieces make point.

Covid third leading cause death country year. fool. keep seeing people talk masks think messaging US wrong:

1. seem emphasize lot masks protecting COVID-19. Asian countries emphasize all. multiple studies showing protective value masks, even unknown point, really reason highlight masks protect.
2. want people feel empowered wear mask, telling masks protect really help. quick poll Asian contacts Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong shows people believe protective value, helps motivate wear mask. countries saw 95% mask wearing rates time without even government mandate. want people wear masks need change culture masks. hard motivated wear masks told protecting someone else.
3. #1 #2 seems spend lot time talking downsides masks. first masks work, N95s do, incorrect mask wear make problem worse, masks protect others. spending much time talking negatives masks, we've really put lot negative stigma around masks. There's doubt improper handwashing cause problems too, spend time talking negatives handwashing?
4. There's emphasis cloth non disposable masks. get might issue early days N95s huge shortages people hoarding we're months pandemic find disposable masks Costco, Walmart, Walgreens, etc. always easy, they're look well online stores. Again, look towards Asia, literally [everyone wears disposable whether medical non-medical. [Taiwan's mentions medical surgical masks multiple times advises people wear masks. US feels like third world country totally broken rely people make homemade masks offer terrible filtration often poor seals. Again, get might strategy March, time really make shift this. Personally I've gone bought disposable masks, rather reusing weeks time like March, use mask day toss it. may great environment, masks PPE. need go far hospital see industries use masks gloves, toss regular basis. Reusing PPE like recipe disaster. Pandemic responses definition based individual, local, state policy. states managed better others US suffered (and died) needlessly due lack Federal International coordination cooperation. motherfucking captain claimed fell lifeboat.

#1919

Boston Molasses disaster, tons race riots, Babe Ruth sold Yankees (and beginning Curse Bambino, lasted 86 years), treaty Versailles, Teddy dead, prohibition.

Mostly shitty year. least got Felix Cat it.  Yeah, dunno.... even Great Depression went much think. overall mortality went down. (Although obviously dealing pandemic.)

They might higher otherwise would be, see realistic deaths despair getting anywhere near even current COVID19 deaths, let alone estimated eventually have. lolwut? 

Scientists certainly said ""hope so"" countless times. research data driven, feelings research. things co-exist.

When data, **hope** get reliable data, also **hope** data shows results **hope** for. 80 percent working 

20 percent sponging 

You stay home forever government cheese section 8 housing 

Meanwhile bunch grunts making sure oil gas drive heat home. 

Vocal minority ass 

We watched riots mass protests, think we‚Äôre going stay home starve? Bless little heart. Shut hell up. full lies. live nyc. Everything fucking closed. Everyone inside. stop. much love make fun backward trump-humping states, lot simply close down.

The states G.O.P. control also ones mostly rely sales tax. Now, get wrong. That's totally blinded ideology refuse properly diversify tax base use income taxes. However, that's situation was.

So went lockdown, states pretty much incapable sustaining period time, president Mitch McConnell made clear would government assistance state budgets, could push crooked plan force states bankruptcy. They've masturbating years idea forcing state governments bankruptcy use ill-gotten packed courts destroy pension plans social safety nets.

Once became apparent would leadership help federal government, states forced either give lockdown simply go bankrupt. Make mistake. engineered top achieve end. Mitch McConnell's bluster supposed ""welfare states"" random, much like plan bankrupt post office random. point carpet bombing would less fatal measure make people stay inside. We'll see, live Lompoc, SB months. know going horse patrols beaches. Tourists coming Lompoc right now, one road trips. BFF lives Goleta works SB proper go office hates it. wants SB completely locked down.

At least Surf beach military allow anyone beach. upvote mean die cops did? Try parkwhiz app ever need parking busy area. saved lot money. OK LADIES, 9:00 know means...

NATURAL GAZONGAS ONLY! Sillycone funbags restricted indoor activities only. Happens semi-regularly Aus. politician badly fucks here, yep common fall sword. way mom passed away. like frog boiling pot. One thing another happens deal thing comes. never time space step back see sick person become. case, doctor finally (I say ""finally"" actually week) sat us let us know going recover. devastating also relief feel like keep believing they're going recover doubt like betraying them. 

Anyway, feel her. can't imagine going months. simple minded way describing medicine works. Though simple mind sees word disenfectant read bleach, perhaps others without budern contextualizing hear also read literal bleach. sign says long haired freak people need apply Meh. Unemployment fell 11% today largely driven young workers returning workplace. Deaths haven‚Äôt moved much all. 

If vulnerable people taking precautions, probably can‚Äôt ask much better outcome. 

At least you‚Äôre honest trying panic people catastrophic policy mistake incomplete analysis. tf would know that??? do? get told badge rub face?? thanks. someone coughs virus, wind blows towards entirely possible inhale viral load enough get infected. think viruses float away space lmao. Like I've said. Better safe sorry. fuck hey, s&amp;p 3% nasdaq time high.

our overlords spoken, they've chosen profits people. statistics miss lot asymptomatic infections, since far everyone gets tested.
There zero evidence virus behaves fundamentally different coronavirus. correct Florida people general seem care pandemic wearing masks. I'd say closer 10-20% people wearing masks instead ""literally one"". word looking ""figuratively"". need Mexican embroidery ones too. people flea markets making nice ones $5  Hooooly defensive Batman. like say there's debate write essay debating anyway lmao particularly fair, I‚Äôd interested see could *actually* that. people weird shit. girl grew that, totally get it. Parties last place u wanna that! 100% agree you. whole 'Karen' meme devolving misogynistic bullshit, ever first place. Getting really tired seeing around. Dumbest meme trend 2020. Hard convince people follow social distancing hypocritically encouraged people gather large mobs ""protest"" weeks ago. Turns out, people sense hypocrisy start ignoring person spreading it.  There‚Äôs zero evidence that. sounds like best case scenario. That's whopper Don‚Äôt forget shooting dogs beating families. Certain age groups risk death, black people risk death, poverty risk death...

There lot research behind things. Former Florida resident here: 

No one controls mouse. done. last two days new US cases shy sum total Canadian cases.

Edit: might agree 1213% aware link posted? Fauci's prediction possibly 100,000 new cases day understatement yet again. 

The March-June seen prelude disaster look back Coronavirus- scale coming dwarfs misery already. fundamentally wrong becomes difficult trust anything coming ‚Äúscientists‚Äù making rookie mistakes. wonder people loose faith them. 

Edited: pointed 6 weeks ago explain recent increase. 

However still wondering 7 day rolling average infections exponentially increasing death rate continues drop. Even time delay seeing increase deaths associated early increases infections. Sorry hear fellow person. hope make full recovery, ever recovering possibility keeps staying safe. fear death, fear able now. fear infecting family. man lot retaliation power.

Corruption, police king Corruption.

The assholes defend pigs bigger pigs. Basketball work bubble playing in. problem system people outside bubble enter bubble someone brings Covid entire thing screwed. Someone struck nerve spend week Florida three days state restricted state. going track you? even break rules? Best luck one guys. worst thing hard lockdown wreck US economy, economy could survived 1 2 month lockdown sufficient financial support, especially every country also locking down. going require 2 month hard lockdown followed another 2 months gradually easing restrictions. damage caused first lockdown it'll catastrophic.

However alternative virus crashing economy would considerably worse. nope spelling error, know probably enough space big ol' brain filled four languages bunch garbage. Adios mariquita jobs! can't eliminate jobs! pneumonia data links. Try again. 200 new cases pretty terrible small state like MA. get together 4th. I'm recently exposed someone Covid-19 getting tested getting negative get tested sure quarantine work mental health affected...all WORTH IT!

Your brother-in-law lost cause. can't use logic probably mentally ill, least low intelligence reason with. dangerous around wearing masks going places unmasked people. Protect yourself. MLB best chance think. Pretty low contact unless you‚Äôre catcher, it‚Äôs mostly played outside. 

Basketball seems worst me, followed football. 

Soccer probably start yellow carding social distancing. It‚Äôs far today. point rail boss putting others' safety money. Same, friend, feel exactly same. Seeing it? Sure. Learning it? Doubtful. Los Angeles County hasn‚Äôt even reported yet actually quite opposite. China promised vaccine developments ""a global public good"".  I'm conspiracy theorist, legitimately asking question, new cases recorded? 10,000 people today go hospital? who's tallying confirming cases day? Exactly. putting price ppls lives.
Disgusting Good call. governor isn‚Äôt going take care anybody obviously. Covid-19 starting sound like Cancer. forms it. stupid someone working soo long wont familiar equipment. mean, dont expect anyone memorize every nitty gritty detail every brick wire reactor isnt hard thing remember.. know lot places always vote one way elections, least change minds people actively trying kill them? Let guess, piece shit cop PAID LEAVE right? 

Fuck police. Three days ago, Gov. Inslee made misdeamor wear mask Washington. Now, he's mandating businesses turn customers away wear mask. He's really taking aggressive steps control virus state. ¬°Ay, caramba! Somehow universities use make money things take six months actual work time yield interpreted data, they're really made number one priority. Dam feel terrible guy think half whatever vote going vote Trump? voting magically changes outcome? Huge assumptions there. Ah yes, twitter screenshot invalid links sources. good old chap. first one COVID data second one invalid. Show actual recent pneumonia data I'll believe you. 5% 10% adults get vaccine, continue outbreaks.

To get level probably require innovative companies allowed compete Abbotts Boeringers. Testing took five min flipped 16 hours 

Please What‚Äôs testing like? meant remark literally tying huge rock legs collective society heaving East River.  Well yeah, they're tiny drunk people. reason stock market booming US government pumping billions stock market Globally, 200k+ added today. Also new high mark, I'm mistaken. Lol. Go ahead copy/ paste EXACTLY said black people. Wait....you can‚Äôt added black people yourself. Go find something healthier fight losing argument Reddit. patients positive. Covid positive. see, need open American deeper penetration COVID. Ok...which one then? demo higher 50% death rate? Tide pods worse imo. together now...

üéµ FIRST day lockdown, country gave me....
2,000 cases! PPE! üéµ world experienced pandemic 1918...not US. Yes, right, first time. know stop feeding trolls, can‚Äôt help it. US breaking record many days come. literally explained specifically percent positive rate can't taken proportional true growth rate. random testing, know right? anyone paying attention fact death rate going slow steady pace? increase cases function testing country never contained virus meaningful way. like looking wave night flashlight switching spotlight. ""OMG! wave got bigger!"" didn't, always there, see before. Keep up. good! Stop testing! Indeed ‚ÄúThere single demographic higher likelihood dying living contract covid.‚Äù

Um. true. also say many tests come back negative?
I'd like know % positive tests daily total. 100k two days. Stunning. What‚Äôs interesting nation around 2. 7 million cases , still less 1% population. Plenty room grow try n find link, thanks! answer questions....In many southern states are. doesn‚Äôt like good lung sucking??? know do!! Well... Keep hoping Gotta admit, that's pretty smart move. places thinking creatively solutions ahead. Looking colleges universities ‡≤†_‡≤† think there‚Äôs difference prepper types conspiracy types currently anti-mask. Don‚Äôt get wrong there‚Äôs pretty large overlap prepper conspiracy theorist venn diagram, preppers buying N95s mostly folks adding extra item emergency kit, full bug-out preppers.  FL resident neighbors stopped talking Biden sign came man made name suing Obama administration infringing personal liberties one thing follow politically forever.

I love it. I'm sad get How's New York still +1000 new infections? enough? Oh wow that's real shame Testing capacity okay. 100x cases per capita many countries. It‚Äôs Hoax. talked Hitler, great people, much respect. talked Hitler, said it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs true. Hitler wouldn‚Äôt lie. Yes. mean, right page 2 welcome packet. also said yesterday virus magically disappear soon. Texas 1 States along Michigan Florida held protested lock down. Yup were. get elected try.

You know talking all.  Guns abortions definitely fall second paragraph.

Families, vehicles whatever kind given arent really caring issues. want state implied, dont care anything themselves. Birx panders Trump. kind scientist allows president say people inject bleach front journalists country? could clarified things speech noooo need activate critical thinking. Second wave clear obvious.

The *epidemiologist* wrote article says wrong.

This matter opinion. debatable. facts laid author, scientist, trump think see want believe. use critical thinking skills recognize expert subject know do. believe primary reason death spike trails infection spike. Certainly better treating this, it‚Äôs still vicious bastard virus. Look death rates month, far less pretty, particularly given ICU capacity statewide already something like 75-80% full. 

Secondary reason better idea treat this. course, run Remdesivir (as one Houston hospital already has) deaths climb some. There‚Äôs good handful medications (Remdesivir, pan &amp; dex/other similar meds keeping patients ventilation still &amp; sedated, etc) run things get bad fast. run pan &amp; dex like, need vent they‚Äôll hopefully give sort sedative don‚Äôt feel dying. That‚Äôs though, point. Without ventilation functionally impossible, severe patients guaranteed die. part scares you, means you‚Äôre paying attention. governor suppressing tests?!

Jesus Christ. none state ineffective 

Ok - wording incorrect - none proven effective, saying innefective. Either way, effectiveness unproven. Rushed drugs way risky rushed vaccines. Vaccines much simpler seldom involve completely untested new ingredients. Also doses usually miniscule compared drugs often take days months even years.

I worry safety rushed vaccine effectiveness. Probably not.

I'm state locked hard early (we 2 deaths COVID today... worked pretty well) cops stopping anyone *anything* height outbreak here.

I'm essential worker still drive work every day.

I one cars interstate would regularly go 120 mph way work because... well, fast car wanted to.

Not never get pulled over, *I see single state trooper patrol almost two months*. week, might every day! know people work health care many social distancing. They're still going restaurants hanging dinner.

It's mind blowing. I've following case begining, thanks zack braff. know Nick before. made couple post Nick news situation. words, think often. think wife kid see people give fuck virus. think there's crowds streets mask saying fake. ""peope"" courage tell wife things they're yelling unmasked streets? I've really mad months people general, think found right word describe them, thought stupid they're not. thought animals no, animals heart. people streets, going parties acting like there's virus disrespectful. Selfish. real danger society. They're worth it, deserve means life they're living. deserve love, deserves miserable, awful humang beings. dont deserve rise child, wife, dont deserve life itself.

People disgusting.

I hope everyone wold know Nick, know worst part? worthless people worthless anyway. care, never care.

Until happens someone love. life fair, suffer. misrepresenting said, seemingly trying justify abuse recieved. true get lot abuse, true anything deserve it. mean, many Ernest movies. what?  bad year USA. like whole place built Indian graveyard something. completely agree. wish states would adopt right die approach medical care. frequently care stage family recipient. It‚Äôs system, it‚Äôs American greed. Prices would reflect single income households US. time factor car, childcare, fuel, etc. second income Americans nearly wash. wife pandemic actually GAINED money even though brings home working saved $1300 month childcare + fuel eating out, etc. 


I, one, hope catalyst America go back single income households. I‚Äôve told wife doesn‚Äôt go back work doesn‚Äôt want she‚Äôs conditioned feel guilty doesn‚Äôt work she‚Äôs still undecided. think it‚Äôs great us spend time son. Sounds different flu far immunity concerned. get flu shot every year, applying covid surprise me. got lucky work asked pull overnight shift night wedding invited to. 

Oh sorry work *sad face* They‚Äôre reporting tests who‚Äôs results come back. numbers days old. Exactly point. - whenever choose. Cue Texas news stories couple weeks racial profiling used enforcing mask order. Don‚Äôt handle fireworks **period** AZ. We‚Äôve enough fires. know people still want fireworks infuriates me. think horror scenes like Italy/Spain/New York happen again, people act respectful reasonable towards disease again? 

Wouldn't governors even Trump order another serious lockdown point? infrastructure treat people need anymore sounds really horrifying...

As European, first time got real me, watching video overcrowded Italian hospital people lying corridors hearing haunting ventilator sounds... education get person better. Let's real universities care making money. think it'd help Abbot people mad local leaders local lockdowns. get benefits locking infection benefit people angry lockdown. teachers need find new jobs. Got it. guess fuck everyone else, huh? I'm sure. youth pretty sharp US. experience people age become susceptible manipulation. definitely waves young people enabling crises afflicting US. Wow could seen coming? Well, go home - Florida May cases. also- bet never see higher numbers state. clear COVID control numbers ‚Äúunder control‚Äù. Crabs bucket. Hmmm get K 2,000?ü§î country big expansive. ton counties, towns, municipalities, unincorporated townships, California too. I'm sure nobody running strong campaign Needles. Baker Barstow definitely competitive. difference India China urban population China rich part, whereas urban population India tends poorer part country. travelled there, alarmed sanitary condition densely populated region cities, definitely way worse I've seen comparable cities China. Really hope India prevent outbreak areas, otherwise would catastrophic. Florida Killin it, 'it', mean  weeding ignorant 10, stayed home alone.

Before one parent working time. LA still report biggest addition. Looks like 54-56k range. still significant under-count. hospitalization rates age. 

15 24 year olds experience 1.8% hospitalization rate.

Once hit 65 hospitalization rate goes 23.9%. Must REALLY bad Abbott gave in. Texans worried IMO.  yet find somehow humane euthanasia.

Those poor, poor people. poor poor workers. Yeah bet. need month 31 days suppose CDC fucking testing contaminated reagents Fauci Adams insisting harm good people wear masks first 4-6 weeks infections US nothing it. particular media source Catholic News Agency. many Catholics believe euthanasia morally wrong, comparing abortion. many people (whether Catholic not) believe ""giving up"" somebody utmost prolong life every condition basically euthanasia. might care proposed treatment low chance success high chance prolonging misery. funny say quite Walmart locations longer allow truckers use parking lots overnight parking without permission truckers would leave piss jugs behind. Masks ensure nobody dies. hear from? Sure does. NY 20% herd immunity didn‚Äôt lock would hit 50+% likely month two. Obviously would overwhelm hospital though Don‚Äôt know NY, travelled internally states rely someone knows you‚Äôve state quarantining get mad report you. they‚Äôll send someone check evidence you‚Äôre quarantining they‚Äôll fine you. avoid forever. rhyme thump ? inspecting voting machines, time Covid grandma Rich people don‚Äôt see fines punishment, see costs. remember riding buddy concert one time. parked 1 hour spot like block away. said ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get good spot concert less $60 cost me‚Äù Ooh would really nice Texas classified 5200 deaths pneumonia 

Can link source this? I've looking recent pneumonia data find 2018 aggregate. Well yeah, removed social distancing measures people wearing masks. feel like democracy pointless someone tell us do?

Where getting from? Ideally laws determined needs many.

Are suggesting laws? mean, make law robbing people? People knows act responsibly rob. Exactly, point, fair say we've reached point return. required ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) treatment used allow lungs (and sometimes heart too) rest &amp; heal they're severely damaged. basically done putting large tubes large vessels legs allow blood taken out, cycled machine oxygenate them, returned body. tubes large enough cause blood flow cut off, resulting damage legs due lack blood flow. also increased risk developing clots, contribute worsened blood flow. leg badly damaged due ischemia (lack oxygenation tissues) requiring amputation. Oh yeah. Texas here. way home work pass soccer fields little league fields. They're total full practicing playing kids. masks. social distancing. Governor said we're going open schools 100%. masks testing temperature taking required. conspiracy theory 101 action.. People proven narcissistic wealthy people willing drive great distances locked areas areas less restrictions. work unless governments everywhere lock everything areas least affected stay open next hotspots.  'curve flattens"" again, must spread re-opening less essential businesses. right. Saw self-preservation rather political, ethically bound correct him. know president is, who's experienced business executive? Yeah, I'm saying, small children know long months are, advise February helpful, can't leave us youngsters lurch April June! end day, go lives gaf anyone died, they'll money, power started with, still plenty supporters. That's sad scary part. picked fine time finish Bad Blood. Spelling subset orthography. Please, continue, fun watch try hard.

No way. 45% ! saying wear mask seat belt, virtually indestructible? could literally travel anywhere wanted country. Yes no? Could New Yorkers get plane fly Miami Atlanta? Yes no? Please get angry. tunnel vision?  Brazil? hot spots can‚Äôt testing like Mexico India? live Bangkok, confirmed in-country transmission corona past month. essentially over, even though actual cases confirmed never supposed close thing. article plans re-open tourism, starting limited, location-limited reopening, extending based results.

This really problematic levels. Tourism makes something like 20% economic input (probably considerable amount domestic travel), country ok without visitors. Re-starting pandemic going back shut-downs also good option. countries taking ""herd-immunity"" strategy approach, US seeming move towards path default, quite possible virus exposure never end. Maybe always impractical every country eradicate it.

Vaccine testing treatment solutions seem fill gap could possibly good outcome.

Remember people say ‚ÄúCOVID comparable flu terms death rates‚Äù don‚Äôt realize failed argument everyone flu reports it.  reacted "" seen new cases June?

My comment ""Is over"" bit unclear. agree. over, looks much better Sweden's top April. cases declining since April. Good luck too. Yeah, meanwhile, Italy, 150 cases day 60 million people, still good mask compliance. YES. Trump accentuates many problems US faced decades. Nothing altogether new. responsible systemic issues accentuated virus live China, masks required day government acknowledged threat. Stay home orders strictly enforced. city 10 million 100 reported cases 1 death. Even number isnt accurate, know never bad many American cities. 

Masks job staying away makes huge difference think need get SNOPES involved one. Seeing journalists unable verify story. Looks like giant game political telephone. Kids got sick party... became interpreted ‚Äúcovid‚Äù party. Tonight grilled green bean chickpea salad feta. 

Then brownie warmed microwave 15 seconds. Borders remain tightly closed every country free coronavirus. 

Welcome Australia‚Äôs rich, dumb Ponzi economy. sides politics desperate keep up. Right, feel 4th July celebrations sort effect COVID surge protests didn‚Äôt? Yup! study, 40% cops admitted participating domestic abuse. So... many smart enough admit it? Hopefully people look results instead trusting lying. 

The demographics hydroxychloriquine much larger percentage black patients group receive drugs. even close. 

A higher percentage males part hydroxychloriquine group. 

Both demographics tend die higher rates. 

They also higher BMI group receive drug. 

Had much higher percentage existing lung disease. pre-existing comorbidities group take medication. 

Had much higher percentage patients ICU critically ill group receive drug. 

All things favor group receive medication better yet worse.

&amp;#x200B;

The blockade good.

No large-scale intensive isolation treatment minor illnesses

No major new bed extensions

No large-scale epidemiological surveys

No mass sterilization

There control measures close contacts

No break chain transmission

There uniform supply PPL

Lack uniform epidemic prevention measures

Lack unified medical resource mobilization

Failure take medical expert advice seriously

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, determination overcome epidemic.

Didn't even take seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I see chance US controlling coronavirus.

The U.S. government wasting efforts people quarantined home coronavirus

It's going cost lot people lives. know. following 3 things, would prevent lives lost COVID-19:

1) Social Distancing

2) Widespread Mask Wearing

3) Good Diet Exercise

I honestly think would #3. country damn unhealthy yet leader ever addresses it. *cue oligarchs laughing* least getting covid might save kids child molesters.  lot people thought this. still think it.

Me, too! thought bars bad...this back school season blow minds. 18 days median amount infection US currently fewest daily deaths since read NYPD lost 40 officers COVID-19, yet refuse wear masks. 40 cops died gang violence something NYPD would running rampage city, yet they're worse nothing. Yikes. I‚Äôve never asked that. wouldn‚Äôt it. **DON'T DARE KILL SANTA, COVID**  would. people it‚Äôs excuse. They‚Äôd find another one, like nonsense oxygen levels. wouldn‚Äôt even bother excuse... look people straight call masks excuse government control us. know one infect kill parents/grandparents. wonder headline story be? could really bad can‚Äôt open. I‚Äôm advocating open close I‚Äôm speculating another issue. need basic income going play game sounds exponentially normal Cause automod sucks Yes, would better could admit we're going Taiwan Korea -- even Italy France -- figure best way move forward ""living virus."" insane even try contact tracing right -- literal joke. Tell pretend mask big, beautiful wall, germs filthy immigrants I‚Äôm sure virus gets Long term health consequences made up. evidence it.
Most people get infected multiple respiratory viruses throughout whole lives without problems. Stop doomsday prophecies.  favorites tho Nah. Old people generally safely shuttered homes. It‚Äôs 18-40 crowd going bars beach driving this. Low death rate, massive infection rate. sure!! feel bad people don‚Äôt opportunity. would think would start program help home education it. kids go school won‚Äôt crowded classrooms. It‚Äôs win-win. no. Let‚Äôs pretend isn‚Äôt happening. prepare all. Early lockdown phase whole thing, lot deniers flooded sub. /r/conspiracy full theories people rural towns speculating hospital ICU activity fake staged.

It's likely many people either got virus know someone did. finally got word false prophet hoax. Omg same. work got stretch cars legs open road. amazing. fuddy duddies back road, forgot drive. Lol yea great beaches open. business know. businesses depend beaches remaining open. feel like I‚Äôm JAWS movie know, something like 20% common colds caused types coronavirus. behave similarly transmit microdroplets. nothing different COVID19 far means transmission many upper respiratory infections caused similar common cold-causing coronavirus.  don‚Äôt know anyone else I‚Äôm online nothing Guess heat shit 'rona? 

As AZ citizen, hate state. responded poorly this. Even lockdowns people meeting mass. karens fighting mask orders wearing chins shit. Shitty heat, shitty brown, shitty people, shitty state. I've wanted move years im stuck due business rental properties. what's going happen landlords get anything? certainly landlords San Diego properties outright, set landlords mortgage liable lose property and/or go bankrupt. 

Then *banks* get evict tenants instead. World War 3 2: Electric Boogaloo. European, fries brain. understand elected, get pick choose laws like? You‚Äôre right. do. thanks  Well, point...what cool kids talking about. Holy Fuck, things get bad. Stay safe people. hope wake call Trump conservatives.

I wish death man, thing. cannot cure wake living dead. lost humanity. Go get it. deserve it. think even Asian parents would proud one Florida really doomed. Sadly test capacity limit fear stop testing irrelevant resources needed elsewhere . course irrelevant sorry surprised much happens US. Congrats beat NY record Bali 60%. yes, high Thailand. main industry though, jot lost. 12% made increased domestic tourism, Thais usually travel abroad travel domestically instead. point they're reliant tourism. things. they? would go Orlando go Disney actually cared all? 
The ones would go ones dont care.  4th July weekend incoming ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yes, now. death rate obviously lags behind new cases days. reason lot younger people getting infected now. 
But need remember people go home maybe infect parents grandparents number deaths rise again. AAP [wants kids back school get arguments. do. kids don‚Äôt get go back school bubble, children aren‚Äôt people matter equation. shown wearing gloves serves deterrent touching one's face, makes conscious fact things normal. 
 
And, change frequently happen while. try keep trips minimal possible, need extended time, they're $7 300 something ridiculous like Costco.
 
You choose sacrifice life meaninglessly like, value continued existence continue take every reasonable precaution. Mask, goggles gloves non-negotiables. things looking Georgia now?  want clicks. think simple. political agenda, magnet pull traffic. countries increased testing exponential increases far tell Illinois' example, masking seems taken exponential function spread made linear function instead.  great. New York like 40k day peak there. Boomers vote twice rate young adults.

in words young adults like boomers' voting choices, absolutely power shift election.

1. Register vote, already
2. available state, sign mail/absentee ballot
3. Get friends either  Lol imagine testing positive NK, probably end ditch could tell anyone. think correct, although thought friend died son, either way. Lol. Buffalo fan find funny.üòÇ still think virus magically disappeared Georgia? It‚Äôs actually bad perspective residents. Things lot spread it‚Äôs harder see effect virus compared place like new york Lmao

He fucking furious California locked threatening moving Texas.

Ahhhhhh long cali locked again
Maybe won‚Äôt rattled time

FYI asking Schaubs former mma fighter fairly large podcaster Brazil half cases US 10% testing. is. 50% positive test rate. Testing nonexistent, unlesss super rich. They've done many tests Louisiana, 4 million people compared 130 million Mexico.

27,394 people died Mexico City late March end May. That‚Äôs twice usual level. government reported around 4,000 coronavirus deaths period. New Zealand? feel like Trump would've already said quotes too, advisors already told no. again, stop saying stupid crap anyway.  it‚Äôs facebooks fault it‚Äôs people use it. See mistake? Saying Facebook devil well replied talking company. Reddit company LOT tailored censorship. Facebook doesn‚Äôt censor curtail anything. Copywriting. Technical writing. Teaching english people foreign countries online (or person they're willing travel another country). Speech writing / public speaking. Advertising / marketing. 


There plenty opportunities people English degrees. Reddit unable think outside box / think creatively people perpetuate stupid memes ""useless"" liberal arts degrees here. r/theydidthemath getting fooled around? shit better ""fake news"". Okay bro, totally remove everyone hits gene pool. Right! It‚Äôs worse airborne Ebola. /s

And ‚Äúlol‚Äù everyone else. half people weren‚Äôt even wearing masks grocery store retail stores (which actually along). majority side - removed gene pool made mad? takes virus much much longer spread entire country population size US somewhere like UK Italy. majority states still seen peak yet, including claiming country whole better Italy intentionally skewing data.

Not mention common sense far worse anywhere else world, mere necessity dialogue concerningly stupid. People get bored headline days flatten curve. Jesus man. hard care lives? 

 
Other countries back normal pretty much. USA stuck limbo take real action worst part authority unless break law, guns ability lie illusion authority. No, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm saying is, rest world known COVID-19 deadlier flu while... US still trying convince isn‚Äôt. 

I think might need see shrink jumping conclusions like that. true. I‚Äôd much rather boat people thinking overreacted current situation virus. one positive though (I hope) greatly decreased cases already. US hasn't. like comrade! brothers arms fighting imperialist!

But rat promotion. understand, standard commie business. Hey worry it! Congress this!! They'll make everything right, get back two week vacation starts tomorrow! Can't keep poor, overworked members Congress working like slaves now, we? way! /s Anyone who's ever watched something called '[The knows probably COVID party going somewhere. way many foolish people US A.

We half asses lockdown allowed plenty businesses (like car dealerships) remain open essential. Hence cases barely slowed sprung right over.

It's joke way through. often mistake responsibility. I'm speaking specifically high schools. kids getting infected, spread to. I'm young healthy still wear mask (and wear correctly). I'm saying choice, personally wear one. opinion. Thanks u actually politely disagreeing going ballistic like people seen sub. üëç Ah shame side ‚Äúbelieving science‚Äù ‚Äúscience‚Äù doesn‚Äôt conform agenda, it‚Äôs wrong too.

Fuck off. Actually no, keep hypocrisy. It‚Äôs entertainment point, especially cherry moral superiority it. Maybe that's Trump refuses advocate masks... someone else got jump hes pissed vindictive it. Also they're using blood plasma survivors infusion. seems help comes antibodies. can't believe right. Biology far complex rocket physics.  Lemme tell bout homeboy Randy.

(As 10 year old UK little bit fan) mean.. play basketball Mondays. Going watch live sport weekend. might eradicated country community here. That's damn sure. president dumber trump

I really hope reinfection isn‚Äôt possible we‚Äôre really really fucked. Let guess, North postivity rate increasing, can't explained testing. antibodies test: know sure true got source.

It incredibly clear many states US facing major health crisis coming weeks, AZ hospitals already beginning capacity, 5 days ago. Houston patients transferred sometimes 50 miles away another hospital.

Florida 100% see things case numbers seeing, together total inaction governor.

Believe, get really really bad. U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A! sorry. lost parents twenty years ago. never forget. see Arizona‚Äôs 1 4 progress, long get worse.

1 4 rising numbers fucking progress 5 month pandemic. cant get regressive that.  Texas, everything bigger not. Unfortunately early say happen. Remember ran toilet paper? That's why. Actually, rate we're going, ever finish first wave. wish knew like... South rise again!....in case numbers.




Dixie fuck wear mask die.  tired winning! sucks necessary. Southern California getting hit hard need stronger response. Quite frankly, Dr. Birx seems incompetent. think really understands math behind pool testing 5-10 people, suggested.

**China**

China pooled testing 10 Million people Wuhan find 300 positives. increasing effective testing rate factor 10. is, took 1/10 time test 10 Million people needed 1 Million (+300) tests instead needing +9 Million tests. mobile testing lab support, effective contact tracing, cycle time really fast. everybody masked staying home strict lockdown, 300 people get infect many people. testing supports system efficiently. That's Dr. Birx wants.

**Florida**

Florida 10,109 new confirmed cases today, current 18% (vs average 8.3%) positive rate. 

If Florida poll test 10 people China did, 100 batches (1,000 people), 14 would negative. would clear 140 people pool. would individually re-test 860 people 86 batches, grand total 960 tests locate 180 actual positives.  

While saves 4% testing effort, takes twice long compared 1,000 individual tests. means 180 infected people get time infect people.

In outbreak situation, delay good. Florida high Reproduction rate, doubled 85k 169k 2 weeks. time wasted retests gives infected time infect others.

Best case, add benefit whatsoever (4% nothing exponential growth). likely, pooled testing actually *reduces* effectiveness process due increased spread within community. 

You can't take pooled testing work prerequisites fast testing, high capacity, low base prevalence place.
____

Updated use current 18% positive rate. least one guy immense pressure deny it, least sympathize him. like everyone else staring smoking hole saying exist. mind asking, would considered at-risk group contracting virus? Oh man, spread It‚Äôs bad while. 

Unless social distancing defined ‚Äúlarge home parties,‚Äù it‚Äôs happening. people aren‚Äôt even wearing masks. City sponsored Independence Day celebrations still happening, maybe 10-20% cancelled area. 

It took multiple days around 700 positive cases Hutchinson say everyone wearing mask (June 19th). Mandating masks still step far. 

When UAMS study projected 1300+ daily cases end September, Hutchinson said nonsense. said none studies accurate far. wouldn‚Äôt surprise we‚Äôre hitting numbers mid-August. 

They cancel Bikes, Blues, &amp; BBQ, Ft. Smith rally also cancelled. cancellations weren‚Äôt city, county, state. organizers taking responsibility right thing. Currently one thou? Nunes tested negative twice probably bad cold. want know many people outside business Ronaldo spread to. Haaaahaaaa! slow person comes witty...I certainly appreciate witty people. Thanks chuckle! going playing... sorry haha Florida month's end total shitshow Surely nothing population?   Pretty irrelevant starts wearing mask. ""Do say do"" great way lead country. see none understand article talking about. Yeah, people parties, going parties. saying putting money pot trying catch coronavirus, first one wins pot, like story came recently. parties TRY catch it, either. care. 

It sounded fake beginning too, like past scares ""rainbow"" parties (you look one up) pill parties like article mentions, kids supposedly put pills bowl take random ones see happens. new scare stories, fit times. Wait Californians head escape local lockdowns  feel American Academy Pediatrics saying school person? agree, think person right now! teacher pediatrician though. Take care! live NYC lockdown I'd hate see actual lockdown looks like. didnt shut subways yeah nurses doctors going get work?? cmon gtfo ignorance know America terrible job controlling situation one state 50 worst entire countries - sort deaths per gotta love right wing idiots coming circle jerk without thinking anything.

Reddit literally leftist circle jerk. look front page.... Quick

How many crack babies Sweden? 

How many meth heads?

What diabetes rate compared remainder western world? Thanks I'm danger every time go store ultra low immune response due chemotherapy... I've social distanced best can, still need food. sadly call older gentleman wearing mask today, replied ""Sorry, forgot car,"" walked back get it. ...At least people honest, combative Austin Texas! Wear fucking mask, everyone interesting see USA finally says ""Okay, enough"" begins fight virus properly. current strategies weak, leading virus buzzing around country forever.  Worse failing, show many places. 

AZ hit 87,425 total cases 1,757 deaths today. Yesterday record 4,878 new cases - 28.32% total tests positive - record 88 daily deaths. Gov Ducey barely ordered 30-day close bars, gyms, water parks week. Everything else still open. Counties/cities decide mask policy.

But ordered stay-at-home March 20 23 new cases, 123 total confirmed cases, 1 death. Lasted nearly 2 months, May 15 13,169 total. now? Fucking ridiculous. 

**No credible evidence supporting claims laboratory engineering FURIN SITE SARS-CoV-2 COPY CHOICE ERROR MIXED INFECTION BATS

I found probable source putative insert adds RRAR furin site SARS-CoV-2.

Ten 12 nucleotides RRAR insert identical sequence spike protein gene Bat Coronavirus HKU9 isolated Rousettus fruit bat Guangdong province 2011.

In HKU9 code TSAG loop region known Gao terminology SD3. first CT putative insert still orphan, relevant possible source rest, albeit frame.

The ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù CT CCTCGGCGGG, last ten identical sequence HKU9.

The sequence context similarities, i.e ‚Äúcagac‚Äù upstream ‚Äúc‚Äù downstream ‚Äúinsert‚Äù aligned here:

HKU9 gcatttgta **caga------cctcggcgggc** ctctgt

CoV-2 tatcagact **cagac** ttgct **cctcggcgggc** acgtagt

Total 14 19 identical nucleotides two runs one gap. That‚Äôs lock.

Copy choice errors mixed infections exact context, since recombination, RNA polymerase hopping one template strand another. case two templates code gene, regions thousand nucleotides one another, genome 30,000 nucleotides. could easily evolution site since mixed infection, period years.

This cannot coincidence.

The natural range host Bat RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, microbat Rhinolopus affinis, overlaps Rousettus fruit Macrobat Yunnan province. latter used bush meat. Also, Microbats Macrobats known co-habit caves. alternate source virus human infection could mixed bat guano cave mixed population.

So definitive source pandemic mixed infection viruses similar SARS-CoV-2 Bat HKU9 ‚Äì copy choice error resulting insert SARS-CoV-2. Could occur bats, intermediate animal human.

Human incubation SARS-CoV-2 could hop max speed train, direct line Kunming Yunnan Province disembark Wuhan train station 6.5-8 hours later, sometime last fall. line began service 2017.

Infected Yunnan, spread there, goes Wuhan, he/she either falls ill spreads asymptomatically another person, initiating pandemic there. initial outbreak occurs short distance Wuhan train station good reason ‚Äì arrived.

This accidental mixed infection wild, infection human form bush meat bat guano, carries high speed train Wuhan ‚Äì likely series events leading pandemic.

The laboratory required natural laboratory bat cave multiple species bats bat coronaviruses.

New Orleans, LA 70112 literally came ask this. 

I'm ER doctor NYC.... states surge now? ICUs overwhelmed? Body freezer trucks? see high numbers cases nationally guess they're spread large area (the entire country) really overwhelmed resources?  cherry picking one day's total greatly sampled tests due previous day reporting tests. look actual number, see King County pretty terribly right downright harmful dangerous pretend like well exact opposite true

Last week reports:

7/1: 251 Positive, 4267 Total, 5.9% positive rate

6/30: 149 Positive, 4456 Total, 3.3% positive rate

6/29: 127 Positive, 5872 Total, 2.2% positive rate

6/28: 168 Positive, 1847 Total, 9.1% positive rate

6/27: 82 Positive, 1928 Total, 4.3% positive rate

6/26: 124 positive, 1764 Total, 7.0% positive rate

6/25: 83 positive, 2354 Total, 3.5% positive rate

Over last week, 140 cases per day. couple weeks ago 50. average positive rate last week 4.3%. couple weeks ago 2%

The situation deteriorating pretty much daily probably going get worse, especially people try pretend like well much worry Oh sick bro, wanna fuck? like everday thing now. Good job America! Greatest country world :) dang scientists constantly undermining trump ‚Äúfacts‚Äù ‚Äúrespect human life‚Äù. Teachers talking refusing go back health. really things going come head. Even there's teacher strike, enough resign they're told going back school full time schools left majorly short-staffed.  blows mind ""if pandemic get better""

""If""

It's almost like believe it'll magically disappear. 

Ah shit. see now. **guess** cop right ticket, court would need prove exception (i.e. doctors note); need state exception is. What‚Äôs feeling seatbelts speeding? reality denial part.

I'm US... seems people different reactions protesters conservative liberal.

I think eating restaurant stupid going outside mass protests police violence. pretty retarded pandemic active.  makes valid points, places got hit early neglected care homes lead lot deaths. NY peaked 10k cases day realistically 50k+ cases day majority symptoms tested, let alone displayed symptoms. 

I agree Florida's deaths rise significantly doctors nurses much better suited dealing Covid patients development terms cures significantly reduce risk death. Florida definitely needs locking though. keep fixing data matches results though. bumbling morons talking deaths followed infections, tip beginning deaths would start reopening infections. say beginning look keep going next 2 3 weeks. sadÔøº think U.S. states able suppress virus like Europe Asia, many reasons. maybe ""ideal"" right word. Anyway, word choice ;) May rest peace. Oh, jeez :( prayers.  Rolling average iron micro trends. week day variability fairly consistent. Fridays biggest days, Sundays Mondays smallest days. removes micro trend. guy never took responsibility, pushed PM We‚Äôre fucked. Man's smart, knows he's doing. listen him. montreal screwjob Fair enough bad right although protests extremely negligent. dont think racism issue painted lefty thing like Americans go ""Libtards"". Politics treated like two football teams either one support. Theres many problems parties delude thinking perfect. voted Tory last election many issues too. Ur probably right, people worst I‚Äôm sorry loss many dying? ah damn son reminded might able get turkey leg fair year.  worrying 40% cops, basically get away murder said made nervous, statistically deviant rate  pushing, shouting, losing temper  partners?

But don't. statistically deviant include shouting definition domestic abuse. Matter fact include shouting 40% probably pretty damn good compared population *should* 0% abuse rate cops. actually matter cops compare general population, number zero. Everyone fired. ""defunded police"" firing every police officer abusive record reached 0%, already agreed would good thing. 

I okay that. would okay getting mandatory counseling though. think someone committing domestic abuse several years cop disqualifier. even think someone cop should. once, counseling. twice. Suspension counseling. Third time, fired. could maybe persuaded go directly firing though. Tough call. easy thing people lie too. include shouting definition support punishment everyone shouts. imagine shouting pretty common job spend entire day getting verbally assaulted people, maybe physically assaulted, may may see baby head smashed dad. saying lockdown vaccine/2 years isn‚Äôt option lots people minimizing risk? Never say isn‚Äôt deadly. wander around neighborhood hungry kids. think behaviour predicted epidemiologists. small portion population acting INTENTIONALLY spread virus new variable. don‚Äôt think know R0 value. hope I'm wrong, too.

But think am. USA USA USA USA! No. Lots scientists giving bad advice masks. Here's spreads lot faster virus,‚Äù said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, infectious disease expert UCLA‚Äôs Fielding School Public Health. ‚ÄúA mask makes feel better, you‚Äôre missing important protective ""Dopplering"" verb incredible Thanks plus one month Thanks, really thoughtful list, things come mind. agree entirely. saying seems absurd claim protests ""no impact virus's spread."" undoubtedly people contracted COVID-19 attending protests, went presumably infect others unknowingly. argue otherwise counterintuitive.

The article could phrased better, saying protests ""minor impact"" ""negligible impact"" spread coronavirus, rather absolutely zero effect all. seem appropriate!

Sadly... Looking forward DeSantis' spin.

When deaths rack refusal ICU admissions, due full units.

Hopefully, little trick **not** counting COVID patients ICU remembered. Oh god. I'm sorry. high quality information. Ideal implies won‚Äôt achieve Maybe ahead time? ""I never said that""

....

""Sure would nice knew China's real numbers started happening. Probably wouldnt make numbers like seem bad.""

....

It sure sounds like implying China reported accurately, 200,000 daily cases everyone talking thread wouldnt look ""so bad"".

Also AZ. different coronavirus? I‚Äôm sure density impact herd immunity. several not-very-dense areas Italy also much higher antibody rates Stockholm.

I followed Swedish outbreak expected take exponentially way NYC US South right now. grew much slower, linear fashion. herd immunity capped epidemic, would expected rapid case rise followed plateau, didn‚Äôt happen all. 

I suspect voluntary social distancing played much bigger role Sweden herd immunity. Well guess start good form imagine wasn‚Äôt getting iv drips everyday lmao would‚Äôve much worse articles get clickbait headline without back article.

Whenever see something say ""may"" ""could"" ""might"" safely ignore it. improve life save time like read lot news. That‚Äôs big problem country isn‚Äôt it. many people arrogant see past bias. Honestly couldn‚Äôt stop laughing name NGL dr fauci said 100k cases thought would 50 50 chance it'll happen. right pretty much definite it'll reach 100k month. thought today would reach 50k.

Or could rely herd immunity vaccinate 50% world need 7,000 years.

So, everyone wasn‚Äôt goddamn stubborn, could reach results herd immunity almost immediately, stomp out, instead waiting vaccine third Americans aren‚Äôt going get anyway.

We really screwed. Europe followed government guidelines strictly.
And practically beaten virus. people refuse follow rules. us understand necessary. 

Europe slowly reopening *without* massive new surges virus. mostly control.

The USA completely different story. I'm utterly baffled messed side pond. Sorry. 

Thank God I'm living here. pray America figures soon , watching afar scares shit me. terrifying. thing us Americans sense entitlement. That‚Äôs makes country goddamn special first place. comes serious shit like virus exposes lack discipline sacrifice living American lifestyle. 

America unarguably social nation world. never really denied anything, speaking natural poverty economic trials. We‚Äôre clusterfuck busy workers party people stuffing faces whatever bullshit it‚Äôs shown us.

It bound happen someday. Dare say, we‚Äôve abused liberties years now. stupid trend kids back they‚Äôd go super markets lick ice cream put back?

Yeah whole big country (I added Toronto minutes post), NYC 8 million 38,242 per kilometer versus Toronto 4,150, Montreal 3,889, Calgary 1,329. top three equal around 5.6 million Canada. 

The difference NYC seems obviously important metric. Oh man haven‚Äôt seen joke pop yet. Someone comment winning. USA #1! Also, government changed stances lot moved goalposts. created frustration made people doubt honesty.

Biggest thing think start said wear mask wanted medical professionals some, 180 started requiring masks.

I understand that, it‚Äôs bound cause confusion make people wonder true. 1) country 10 times populous. talking raw totals cases? Canada's education system's little lacking guess eh?

2) know okay pollute planet another country too. Canada done nothing ruin world shitty military war crimes

Pax Americana literally helping spend hardly anything military stay safe Russian Chinese aggression stay safe home using internet created computers invented complain. months America burning ground coronavirus people jobs

Canada's unemployment rate currently higher US. lmfao. months households still crippling debt despite healthcare education handed people still flocking America though. fucking shithole.

 First, seen ""parking lot triage"" developed country stage outbreak. could have/ done lockdown better, states expanded hospital capacity drastically since March. read news random hospital Texas increased ICU capacity 10% week mean happening across country. 

Second, cases found predominately younger people, higher chance surviving virus. fact. make what's happening acceptable, like majority people testing positive hospitalized 65+ year olds like back March.

Third, we've able drastically reduce death rate. [Someone hospitalized 4x less likely die huge, probably death rate dropped 25% time high despite cases decreasing 30-ish percent. 

Fourth, we're lot aware virus, people careful late feb- early march virus spreading undetected.

And, alternatively, rural areas seem lot individualistic culture, live ranch middle nowhere, assumption neighbor's problems really affect you, break leg, got deal yourself.

I spent several years Montana, attitude much ""people whatever want care, get trouble, they're own."" Whereas lived New York Philadelphia, attitude ""I'm going lots opinions people's choices, I'm going shocked lots opinions mine, chances good might affect us.""

This article sickens multiple levels. May unpopular question. Know I'm side quarantine think country gone apeshit open back already.

My boss denier basically says whole thing totally blown proportion. seems like lynchpin belief death rates found over-reported. Some(?) hospitals reported death COVID death even cause actually disease-related. way put someone car accident died injuries would reported virus death tested positive even nothing death).

Does anyone evidence/data prove wrong? Cuz I'm quite sure is, even know begin looking it.  live FL fucking isolating since March girlfriend (thank god least 3 cats keep company). 

I legit gone drinks eat done anything fun like used to... go bars, movies, parks, game nights friends, etc etc.. 

We even seaworld pass looking forward using waterpark summer... opened, nope, we're going. FUcking sucks, this, hand sanitizing everytime go groceries whatnot, kn95 masks everytime, people seem care.

Today, moment weakness thinking.. go eat? really wanted gastropub used go semi-frequently... realized dumb ended getting take out. I'm tired shit wish Floridians would take shit seriously. LA County alone likely report 2000+ cases... looking good. Florida always makes state feel better. unheard considering coronaviruses responsible common cold also produce short term immunity lasting less year. [many remaining regarding post-infection immunity people nonchalantly claiming herd immunity possible without vaccine gambling people's lives. states faring better others. I'm WA, though things ticking little bit, we're still much better many states. I'm hopeful keep things control, kudos Gov. Inslee pretty good job far (and continues thorn Trump's side).

The problem worry interstate travel, gets really bad. get point state troopers going manning interstates, trying prevent people crossing state lines? seems unthinkable, lot things unfortunately happening days ... I'm disagreeing number opinions... particular, lower death rates indicative lower infection rates higher infection numbers solely due increased testing 

I'm also defending position people Europe rightly look horror happening US, despite higher per capita numbers. There's article guy got priapism blood clots penis. Fair enough. think people taking seriously everything happening two worlds: one look outside bright sunny day another ICUs packed people dying lonely death.

Wily, merciful, COVID kills people vent, extended period time.

With Ebola, people dying streets. Nearly every video Ebola least dead people lying side streets.

Maybe people see death destruction front they'll take seriously. given death hidden away, can't comprehend tiny heads. Misleading title. RT PCR method use detect viruses genome. works artificially replicate DNA/RNA plastic dish incorporating dyes newly formed genetic material. DNA copies made fluorescent dye quantitate relatively much DNA started based many replication cycles takes reach threshold level dye detection.

So basically lower ""count"" cycle means started genetic material amplified detectable amount faster. terms Covid test means copies virus patients sample, meaning higher viral load problem low incidence disease population (say 2%), probability actually ""true positive"" test says positive around 30%.

The math little complicated that, really reliable tests, need 99% sensitivity &amp; specificity range. Tremendous. Click bait title click bait Shocking. Truly shocking. virus spreads exponentially, would spread exponentially. haul unwrapped nearest scrap processor~~

Every year, *something* kills large number elderly people - usually flu - yet treating Covid like black death, clearly isn't. was, I'd wearing mask agreeing extended, destructive lockdowns, Covid really dangerous. 

And even blatantly clear anyone paying attention, ideas extended lockdowns, mandatory masks, mandatory vaccines immunity passports widely embraced large segment population. find worrying. 

The fact many willing give freedoms - without questioning motives behind them, actively dismissing anyone so, actually scary. anti-democratic. 

If going introduce measures like these, proven actually effective throwing meaningless blanket statements, like ""save lives"" ""cuz Coronavirus"". 

In way, mask almost become symbol unquestioning obedience State. p2:

This lasted almost three months, month June curfew quickly lifted students invited back dorms (during quarantine period, state announced repairs renovations done students away, apparently take place).

On 21st June, Government elections took place; results 65% win POS leading party, combined 15% two parties made past census (which 3%), \~49% total voting body (there like 15 parties collect 3% votes). means POS ruling party effectively held 190/250 representatives senate.

Meanwhile things going shit here. That's fair comparison. spreading NY/NJ area people aware -- unchecked community spread. started locking down, tests scarce people symptoms even permitted take test. turned away asymptomatic people wanted test precaution. 

The rate Arizona much lower considering tests freely available, get test suspected exposure without symptoms, they've months prepare. Yeah, one ever told anything wearing mask M√©xico. people poorer. believe societal threshold riots massive spike robberies violence much lower here. I'm worried us all. Beautiful username potential right there. Could shot kill. work retail Danbury, it‚Äôs busy hell since we‚Äôve reopened. almost 100% CT customers come masks worn correctly, problem. 

Not make racial, since we‚Äôre close border, ton black people New York come shop always either wearing chin all, get extremely rude confronted. 
I think there‚Äôs kind mentality wearing masks submissive weak it‚Äôs infuriating. Notice said ""For majority!"" Even admitting majority, minor illness. stop counting illegal immigrants? numbers drop zero, need walls all, save billions dollars process !  Hope trick doesn‚Äôt actually work, fee full brunt Trump done fucked even kids safe honest. Anyone get severe COVID symptoms.

Edit 10: still waiting LA county  moron, point whole thread going compare Covid19 seasonal flu would stop counting deaths May. People die influenza year. keep track flu season deaths. reporting citing, 60k deaths annually flu season. October May. already July. People died covid influenza June. False 

You heard shit repeating Wtf movies movie theatres now. Dick Fucking Cheney came saying wear mask. That's know fucking serious.

Also Texan, here. Texans nice care others average American. Pretty sure vocal minority anti mask. crazy thing local government Abbott rejected it. one taking credit. local county commission voted basically overturn governors mandatory mask order. read letters local hospitals talking concerned increasing number cases asking commission make mask order mandate. voted basically overturn order make ""recommendation"" enforce. again, claimed ""people best."" 100% wrong. Would rising number cases people best? sure, let's continue regulations. could possibly go wrong?   Jesus. Yeah, difficult times, wish loved ones best. Cali done yet falsely claimed China ""started whole thing"" zero evidence that, multiple confirmed sources contrary. want make claim, source it. Exactly. get people think abolishing SAT ACT good tests literally objective standards base admissions. Yeah move on. Nothing see here. good. It‚Äôs flu. Go daily business. I'm shocked He‚Äôs hysterical. Take infirmary  completely agree, nothing set stone immunity cautious forming policy definitely right call. would caution comparisons common cold coronaviruses mild infection symptoms produce are. Viruses like elicit strong immune responses typically need get cleared, decreases chance long lasting immunity. Typically stronger infections generate better long term immunity. Better comparisons would SARS MERS Could explain? familiar term. Serious question. Floridian told family members hospitality reason it‚Äôs saying 10k antibody tests counted (previously weren‚Äôt counted) it‚Äôs backlog catching makes seem worse is. Sounds fishy can‚Äôt find anything online back statement (but local news reporting thing). Anyone else knew could gotten info? Keep mind people also admit publicly hotels saying expecting 65% capacity due covid 4th July, privately tell slammed already capacity. link doesn‚Äôt say anything say does. updated protocol gets tested. qualifier getting tested, automatic positive. Judging lack simple understanding here, don‚Äôt think trust opinion one see source knowledge. 40000 times 10 400000. America shithole.  numbers inaccurate? Source? Thanks, I'll see can. We've done video thing phones. nice. couple times talked 15 feet away, masks. LOL, understand eachother well way. Mostly arm waving hand signals. find detail? We‚Äôre getting increasingly bluer. Lots us trying. English translation Don‚Äôt give 2020 anymore ideas Covid strikes back again.  TIL - US quarter world's population One statistic used counteract deaths-above-normal rate.  States can't control interstate commerce. That's always federal level thing.

Which I'm sure tested court actual things like shipping, probably never things like closing state's border pandemic.  actually said yesterday football season jeopardy people start wearing masks.

I surprised said that. (Although still make fucking order wear masks). wonder people agoraphobia think COVID-19 life. never fully locked down. 

It‚Äôs obvious whole 2 week thing two short time frame.

And yes Northern States seeing rises. China's fault  people dying They're dying they're falling ill Honey 1 Koch brothers still alive ....money important people.... keep asking description looks like. People need know happens get car accident hospitals full.

And ambulances busy bussing COVID patients rehab facilities morgues hospitals.

And wait. help. arrive.

Where articles tell us path leads? bright side, hit herd immunity really study death rate determines serious virus actually is, still keep deaths low despite hospitals overwhelmed constantly, ignore strategy might best way go. easy way slow anymore comes huge risks severe sacrifice. cure might worse problem, hopefully Arizona proof case. Trump also came said wear mask:  time school gets closer real safety plans developed virus raging evermore control states, maybe could happen? [this There‚Äôs still tracing going on. saw article categorized virus type 1,2,3 (in terms tracing) China US type 1 Europe type 2. Indicating virus likely came China. Also original comment many dislikes? I‚Äôm clearly biased medical journal said hcq zinc positive effects. Guess people really hate trump suggested. Even though I‚Äôm anti trump facts facts. needs throw rallies supporters weekly basis states, especially contested ones. 

Him still holding rallies could best long term actions takes office help American people. live fl and, city live in, process opening 6 new testing centers week.

perhaps decreasing testing elsewhere, definately increasing testing capacity. many tests facility day? idea many around country? Point taken, ways design bio weapons. dramatic, quite insidious. yeah. used vaccinations wipe infections planet already.. done. polio example. one gets anymore everyone vaccinated. mump, reubella, longer exist.  take thousands years... less 100 years. measels, also pretty much completey gone except places refuse vaccinate contagious coronavirus is. shots came 60 years ago. even 1 million people get vaccinated slowed virus significantly. Haha wtf Would bad idea go home Florida weekend? It‚Äôs generic drug. Don‚Äôt far lower death rate per capital UK? Florida really necessary republic? USA: setting standard failure. what...what kind argument this? Canada Australia part Commonwealth let's pretend they're ""partners"" Britain, actual geography damned? intentionally disingenuous, you? deaths going up?  Texas needs this! need lockdown Probably child-free wank getting pissed children existing world. One possibility lumping viral positives antibody positives. means someone fought mild case, infected minimal viral load able fight weeks ago, show positive antibodies. Depends big inheritance is. could see one, go profile comment mentioned copy paste. 

Anyways, reality this: debate people want, spend hours time go back forth, going conclude people believing want believe. words, one going change minds going change yours. cops decided announce enforce laws see fit?

Why? 

We already know that. Google Anybody apologize you? using mask June. northern states mostly holding steady. entirety south southwest going hill fast. Even rural areas protests.

I'm sure protests help, they're drop bucket problems. main problem people protesting rather protest itself. fair, really matter kind send, work, cases may opposite effect! Chlorinated water agree.

Our base taken **very** seriously. We've 19 total cases (for small AFB) February we've seen one case since then.

If everywhere else US strict, see 10k spikes day. *The Telegraph claimed study initially rejected several academic journals, including ""Nature"" ""Journal Virology,"" indicates considered article unsuitable publication.* 

Let's know ""top notch"" research üòÇ guy purposely lied masks necessary ""more important people get first"". happened Arizona (and probably places)? People looking reasons think happen them. value person died. im sorry comes mean ignorant whats bad lung transplant wouldnt long recovery process live life love covid related subs downvote pointing facts

That'd they're facts. Australia's area uninhabitable desert far urbanised America. Two cities make nearly half population, ~85% people live within 50km east coast.

Yes US 13x population... 340x many covid cases. never understand people refuse wear mask global pandemic especially see high death toll case numbers. father, sperm donor is.

And are. idea we're trend Nebraska. pretty bad rates awhile, seemed like hit meat processing plants hard. people suck wearing masks social distancing populated part state. 

It pure, dumb luck. Masks work lie? Deaths decreasing better job month ago. 

The temporarily decreasing death toll reminder *we know better,* justification fucking up.  course support right criticize. since criticisms contain things aren‚Äôt fixable changeable (eg heat) I‚Äôm encouraging use brain modicum common sense leave.

That really great. I'm 100% certain we're US! protesting ACTUAL FUCK?!



YOU ONE FUCKING JOB  ""left leaning"" person sure seem love linking corporate sponsored skeptic think 1979, information director FDA said, ""Whelan makes blanket endorsements food additives. organization sham, industry front.""[30] 1980, ACSH co-founder Frederick J.

I've known American couples kids situations like managed emigrate (to Europe, usually kind ancestral connection work offer) night day much less stress here--it's one really sees value social safety nets here, daycare workers supported protected whilst parents maintain health insurance pay matter ups original employment. realise may cold comfort right top Americans even allowed travel much, ever wanted consider coming Europe looking practicalities job shift bringing kids, we're talking lot r/iwantout. I'd say close half posts times lately North American parents young kids looking options going Europe Asia lot fellow parents exchanging ideas. No. They‚Äôre not.

Canada‚Äôs wonderland still open, doesn‚Äôt plans open (as far I‚Äôm aware) September earliest.

AMERICAN theme parks utterly ridiculous considering like 5% cases America still plans reopen them. Double every week jfc mental health can‚Äôt take lockdown halp stop refusing masks stop going partying fellow Americans need beat this.

Edit: American Wait 4 weeks. Deaths surge. Hopefully much last time better treatment younger cohort will.

Hospitilazations already up. Deaths lag bit more. Wow... almost always Texas.  everyone makes disrespectful comments weight. know connection, please, respect dead? god‚Äôs sake, body still warm loved. focus that. nightmare! sad indeed know serious different places taking reactions case numbers. 63 whole country great concern, 50,000 everything fine. posting back 50k people sub, time mentioned Corona got labelled nutcase. fact, main course action time people going normal life quietly stocking needed items (like masks). People reminding 'alarmist' friends co-workers would detrimental career social life, intertwined days. many examples posted here.

We knew masks - even T-Shirt - filtered significant amount virus air. knew studies referenced tests done years ago. knew Dr Fauci lied everyone said masks help, MSM helped spread lies. also knew lied - people buy supply.

It nice back then, actually informative smart people good critical thinking skills honest grass roots research find truth. Maybe common theme one really believed anything media. Watch people do, listen say people - especially journalists, politicians, political partisans - lie. lie time. 

I think around 150K subs mutated yet another partisan political morass, people nothing regurgitating last lie told. Pretty useless sub now.

They‚Äôre San Diego weekend Damn. That's rough read. hope okay. California, Washington, New York burning down. 

You would surprised state gov. California handled this.  shut quickly never disaster NY had. Except LA pretty bad since lockdown, people gave up.  bad crisis yet, high numbers.  hospitals gotten close running beds, ICU beds, ventilators.  probably fine CA unless numbers suddenly overwhelm us, go complete lockdown needed. *"" ‚ÄúShe said hospital sending results lab lab coming back positive. decided send different lab lab said test results negative,‚Äù Steube said. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre getting lot false positives.‚Äù ""*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm expert testing, noticed saying sent OLD sample different lab... sounds odd. Really sounds like looking reason throw doubt numbers. people keep getting tested time? seem economically unfeasible based reluctance doctors perform tests without symptoms.

In experience, doctors prescribe random tests unless symptoms.  Gotcha thanks! Define ‚Äúmassive‚Äù. Seems lot folks claiming 5 year delta explains away sizable outcomes differential. course Reddit commentariat correct researchers put name study / words printed places WSJ simpletons. /s

I‚Äôm essential worker drive Destin every day see tons state plates. It‚Äôs busiest I‚Äôve seen Destin since moving 2011. I've gotten dms strangers saying thanks helped them. reason it. I'm liberal absolutely terrified beginning. Mid May noticed articles recycled current date. Snapped right it. Tbh, I'm tired pretty much it. There's definitely institutionalized behavior still need shake even though know IFR. Fear gnarly. Don‚Äôt forget confederate flag Australia flag UK Union Jack upper left corner.

GOTTEM! Oh fuck, destroyed facts logic. saying another thread somebody got magatriggered tried tell fast testing available everywhere us. Yes totally agree, reason ignore deaths mostly speaking CFR/IFR discussion. snow, plenty do. Lots exercise shoveling Chinese aren‚Äôt stupid

I dont think either. prideful? promised release Covid-19 effected much every part world. way helps them.

How praised leaders poster child handle covid? Also thousand dead seem like something would bother county billion people. upset ruined economy end worse start. Deniers rolling graves soon. Massachusetts pretty good. I‚Äôd say states take ‚Äúmuh freedum‚Äù seriously lives fellow citizens need wake up. It‚Äôs gonna masks long time folks. even look fat photo. appears indoor establishments opening en masse main factor new coronavirus cases.

Just advised family members medical degrees, seems wearing mask severely increases risk around you, attending events dining indoors particularly risky. 

I personally, however seen much less mask wearing social distancing (Taiwan) recently stopped quarantining since seems coronavirus control early action robust puclic healthcare system. still mandated must wear masks public transit almost everyone chooses wear masks indoors, except restaurants, due extremely bad look caring health around wearing one causes - especially workplace setting. infected, less deaths seems  sympathies you.  ""Airports airlines strongly encouraged..."" &lt;- direct quote. Jack shit then, it?  Anymore...that know of.. That‚Äôs thing. never lockdown Texas way us states. ok seriously dude. 99+% cases mild asymptomatic. delete misinformation. 

I know kind elaborate troll, parents died severely sickened, maybe spreading b.s. stance government overreach. I'm even really sure hate masks. think stance government can't tell along taking virus seriously. concept face masks new US government told us Feb March anything. actually feel like stayed clamped extra month probably could killed it. flattened curve, would nice end like New Zealand. mean silver lining here, problem ultimately self correcting. going tragic path, we'll lot better come side.

* Steroid use began falling favour following McMahon steroid trial, resulting leaner 'New Generation' early 90s spearheaded likes Shawn Michaels Bret Hart.

* Following death Eddie Guerrero 2005, WWE implemented 'wellness policy', suspends performers illegal substances, also performance enhancing substances excessive alcohol consumption. issued 40 suspensions first decade, enforcing policies facilitate culture change.

* Older generations wrestlers lamented interviews difference locker room attitudes, much co-operative, less adversarial times past - largely negating need steroids performance enhancing substances.

While true likely see wrestlers stream Twitch help Make-A-Wish foundation, still occasionally stories substance abuse (Jeff Hardy's DUI's etc.). Official according who? Gamecocks, South Carolina least hear ""younger average age"" argument time. would relevant younger older people segregated, aren't. people disease means old people exposed.

And also conveniently skipped *extreme* unexplained increase pneumonia deaths Florida. top fact Florida head Department Health fired fudging numbers way Desantis wanted. feels really disingenuous argue things heading positive direction Florida way, shape, form. facts. nothing said wrong. sure might population density major cities, 2 facts gave absolutely wrong.

this sub related ones downvote anything somewhat goes doomsday narrative try push.  Feels weird state like months. Forgot parts country r run idiots sometimes way, maybe via injection something, get lungs? gets number. may hopefully wake call. Concentrating wealth, business mergers, drop labor power relative corporate power, greater percentage taxes increasingly shouldered mid smaller business payroll middle income taxpayers, rising costs essential insurance, rising cost housing, rising cost childcare child expenses, rising costs uni, flight jobs rural areas, offshoring jobs money. noticeable much financial security purchasing power much earlier milestones hit average mid-middle class 50s+ age especially 70s+ age crowd.

Money-driven politics 60s-90s created problem. Now, younger generations working harder less, buffeted downturns uncertainty, increasingly obvious ""success"" matter making right connections raw talent. system tilted ever towards inherited wealth power. matter political alignment, younger generations resent that, good reason. 40% cops domestic abusers, would trust cop help spouse beaten cop husband? Per capita ... United Kingdom 40% USA.

It's little disingenuous mention statistic without mentioning worst-hit 27 states + DC (with combined population double UK) **have higher per-capita death rate** UK.

Also, re: Canada -- let's death rate comparison US decided include deaths instead hiding 25% ""influenza like illness"" ""pneumonia"". Well spot on... People don‚Äôt really America anymore. That's exactly thinking (ok, maybe not) üòÜ utter fucking bullshit can‚Äôt even fathom people trying say protests didn‚Äôt effect. Hundreds thousands people shoulder shoulder close proximity hours end going homes towns didn‚Äôt increase spread?

Fucking listen yourself.  stating US goal 532 deaths per million, like dear old Sweden? really pissed WWE cereal one last night he? point, anyone woken lost cause. remember US maybe hundred cases wondering time bad would get. fed response somehow even worse expected stopped looking ""death toll"" number ""lucky folk get meet Jesus early"" much winning.

Didn't teach y'all lession? Beware Nobel Laureates strong opinions outside exact field. says means first paragraph article :-) people refusing getting mask wearing. fact took New York three weeks complete lockdown peak. still ain't good Texans. here's brightside. I'm florida we've done nothing still There's nothing pedantic it. simply wrong. try deflect move goalposts want, change simple fact. I've already explained how, suggest go back re-read conversation educate instead blaming everything people ""being pedantic"".

Words meaning. stick tequila I'm Florida. Good know though. avoid tap water Haha.. thats end career... Make America Greatly Affected! Florida #1 Still requiring masks onboard suggesting it. old old. latest ""theory"" circulating Facebook recent increase tests duplicates; people get tested multiple times reported new cases. Like Facebook theories, there's evidence large scale problem, although cases states routinely post corrections. 

I think would explain increase, since hospitalizations also up. 

Although know sure, may combination younger people getting now, improved treatments. well people minor cases tested, bring death rate. 2 weeks? know that's long enough? someone tell them? Atleast start. Policy fine tuned next weeks. probably extended. That's went Michigan - governor kept extending closures. Tell everyone things closing two months freak fuck - tell everyone they're closing two weeks, four times, much less freaking. People stupid. True wanna feel smart going grain. Probably not, play day long. minimize foot traffic, housekeeping staff service rooms week increase services upon request. public spaces, Clinton said housekeepers routinely sanitize elevator, lobby hand rails. Public restrooms also closed every two hours cleaning. NBA guidelines added housekeepers frequently clean, disinfect sanitize high-touch surfaces (every two hours), medium-touch areas (every two four hours) low-touch areas (every eight hours daily).

They responsibilities, too. teams begin quarantine July 7 11, Disney employees arrange meal delivery placed outside person‚Äôs room. clean disinfect training practice equipment uses team leaves area. teams responsible laundry, Disney employees clean hotel linens. Disney also staff take-out restaurants employees eliminate staff turnover. required wear masks gloves, staying least six feet apart.

When asked Spain Italy, hands, ""well can't expected answers"" yet ""know Covid thing bullshit."" call doctor. Stop touching friend‚Äôs kids Dark Ages, anti-scientific evidence anti-intellectualism governs. Please somebody explain like I‚Äôm five. Fauci better STFU he's gonna get fired. YEAHHHH GO FLORIDA!  Seems pretty serious. Almost like highly contagious, deadly debilitating virus there. Someone notify states like Arizona, Texas Florida. lifeguard, horrible idea True. easy answer definately heartbreaking tragedy essential independent contractors, give many rights now!   lazy putting risk building lifestyle I'm minimally affected this. nearest major hospital 5 hours away. knew bullshit coming cause bat researchers interesting people talk couple drinks. knew Trump would fuck response attention span stick effort conclusion.

I investigated area, 3-5 days went small city lab 5+ days stayed town extra day two courier pick up. nat guard came testing even notify negative positive would take 48+ hours- testing blitz.

You say available 5 hour drive away tested sort reasonable timeframe I'm going doing. mean, windpipe could come ass Balanced whole bunch factors. Including average age resent spike. US gets cases every 3.5hrs Australia ever had. really hard wrap head around. exactly think data comes from, doctors actually attend, declare time death, fill form leads statistics referencing? come nowhere, people writing articles generating them. Nothing talk unfortunately. easy claim breathing problem mask like asthma etc. wat? make costumes incredibly nonelastic make body standards 'official' without outright stating (which would illegal).

Years ago knew Yellow Power Ranger. used Pink Ranger abs got developed, Yellow costume extra inch two around waist. 'performer' isnt exact right measurements, cant wear costume, lose job.

Most shit Disney shady; I'm surprised there's even union employees honest. wife went test today Florida 9 am. absolutely full, mean full gave hour moving. Cars everywhere. Brevard county. mean saw article yesterday Trump said coronavirus going go away. thought months-old repost, nah literally yesterday bruh

I wouldn‚Äôt surprised launch nukes anymore [Such incredible go back work Monday. like you, two employees office week trip Florida. PCB area think. One severely immune-comprimised, told, ""we go beach...."" definition completely agree. Still waiting national mandate, know, try get control COVID thing. Oh ok, interesting. mom got pretty sick water Mexico spent entire vacation sitting toilet misery. Ruined vacation. So, good know case ever travel there. wonder Trump President ever fuck big ignore him.

We know Obama listened him, that's SARS Swine Flu become huge issue, can't think times though. around since Reagan. I'm going say maybe AIDS thing ran issue. But, seems like Trump's administration ones basically cause situation get worst. feel like every President would nipped virus bud.

You read files whats going on. Decide best solution isolate it. stop trades China, travel China month so. Explain situation countries well. basically prevented issue hitting hard. actually booked vacation entire extended family Disney august COVID hit. able get refunds credits everything. 
I can‚Äôt imagine walking around Disney wearing mask heat humidity. still dangerous. btw, .4% US population 1.3 millions deahts, tons tons survivors disabilities.

And that's lower studies say death rate is, that's also including whether ICU's get full/overrun. States lack legal authority close borders. Unless like cite it? WTF? thought Cuomo sensible.

Well known wrong while. 2 parties big companies write checks sides. Mexico? They‚Äôre like young children. ‚ÄúMy favorite whoever last bought ice cream!‚Äù allegiances change quickly go whatever immediately benefits little foresight. Honest question. parties super spreaders, possible going schools opening weeks? can't wrap head around small party okay, schools are. Saw thing Detroit, really small grocery hard stay 6 ft away people. Cop look like waiting someone say something him. cashier told whole lock - never wore mask. Let's say family 5 needs take small loan approximately $10k take trip stay days. catch every freaking cold goes friend's kid's school well. Sigh. sure mean. 

each day, get new batch results (sometimes many weekends labs closed). 

You look one-day totals, historical numbers. many people prefer look 7-day rolling averages, smooth reporting issues. massively well. ethically, believe go essential workers first, priority people third world countries face choice working going hungry. People work home like last line. preferable

You've gone far. Hell yeah, new record way sooner that. Florida alone doubling every 7 days. Hmm coincidentally 50 percent people voted Trump... it‚Äôs almost like believed bullshit spewing fat disgusting orange mouth covid hoax Muh EConOmY Elon straight utilitarian. mind, companies straight saving human race helping avert global warming establishing bases planet. doesn‚Äôt care dozen workers dying keeps track larger goal saving millions/billions. extent money matters it‚Äôs secure goals invest ones.

It‚Äôs good, find weird people say it‚Äôs money. There‚Äôs many easier ways could become far richer that‚Äôs mattered. Maybe.  sure would actually different state level.  would different president stop moronic policies state level? Years ago wife CNA class presentation front class mispronounced hospice ""Ho Spice""  drug lifesaving. makes Trumps buddies richer. never sequence samples. 2020, sequencing hard. Regardless start virus never going eliminated like NZ. We‚Äôd social distancing til vaccine either way Dig fuckers, read tweets gonna worse many camels Covid Test? knew pandemics could complicated? posted video JAMA interview. suggest watching entire thing.

 anyway. Couple key differences: Tokyo fast effective federal response. acted quickly. 

The culture Japan also apples oranges American culture. mindset collective. Mask wearing consideration others already common practice there. Scroll daily new cases active cases charts. That‚Äôs exponential growth looks Pfft what's this? thought Texans stick guns. don‚Äôt like people opinions there. obviously don‚Äôt like everything. leave. part living too. 

I‚Äôm using logic don‚Äôt see sudden you‚Äôre idea don‚Äôt like something somewhere leave mantra sudden. 100% everything said. grew age 23, finally leaving shit-hole moving. Yeah. posting shit cellphone already everything terrified more.

And apparently nanotech already. Bill Gates, George Soros, Dr. Fauci President Obama lizard people.

People really fucking stupid Considering many people protests still socially distanced possible, quarantined protesting, regularly got tested protesting, took every precaution could, including masks, think anyone sees one failure decides follow suit always going stop distancing.

Its interesting people defending learn anything large amounts people following rules. found justification one thing already doing.

We needed social distance long people done properly start. Yeah, maybe best choice, especially people take crowded cars, buses trains pools Focusing benefits staying safe fantastic attitude, hard manage staying sensibly safe giving anxiety future. fact working get global community pretty cool though, gives hope.

I'm defending it, I'm saying cares. Choosing car based CEO's Twitter dumb inability even name CEOs (who keep silent) proved point. Exactly. sad state affairs. Exactly. Plus it‚Äôs curve; it‚Äôs exponential point starts regressing (and limit total population) hire guys tour around Florida teenagers don‚Äôt give anymore.

No, isn't. Making *irrelevant*

You good peer review thing you? data falsified tells absolutely nothing data looking for.

I accept admission zero data hydroxychoroquine efficacy. husband brainwashed. us brainwashed confused. director CDC said recently actual case number may 10 times higher reported number. 

Fact: least 131,000 people died Covid-19 3 1/2 months. 

And actual death number probably much higher. rate spread region actually higher spring.

Thanks insight! literally see stuff antigen test counted one source - local news - giving serious side eye.  doubt north Florida take seriously publicly 4th July even Labor Day - tourist season that. staying inside now. way world going on. help we'll get governments social distance wear masks. full lock downs. fully people decide want they're going live lives going forward. pray vaccine actually work. Hopefully less take it! Nah agree. one's taking much notice lockdown UK month spike. think there's like one confirmed case day whole county clearly felt smug writing reply.  What‚Äôs mommy making dinner? Honestly, masks mainly prevent infected spreading further.

That‚Äôs find outrageous go YouTube see many people complaining masks comment section news videos.

I saw new video last night so-called ‚Äúcitizen journalist‚Äù laughing someone wearing mask relatively quiet beach. taking personal responsibility caring others around something laugh at? 

The people ‚Äúcitizen journalist‚Äù spoke also joined in, laughing lone woman wearing mask, minding business harm anyone. lot stated ‚Äúthe fake news media fear mongering‚Äù creating false narrative damage certain world ‚Äòleader‚Äô. serious?! global virus affecting everyone‚Äôs daily life killing thousands there‚Äôs election later year?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

They also like saying wearing mask ‚Äútaking away freedoms‚Äù. know takes away freedoms? alive choice wearing mask first place. Elon evil Teachers? teachers? majority planning return work unless mandated otherwise. districts planning every scenario. You‚Äôre fear mongering. half people protests wore masks. protests, least jurisdiction, outside,‚Äù virus spread well outside, Roberts said. ‚ÄúAnd would say 50% protests wearing face mask.‚Äù Traffic fatalities growing exponentially. Uhm, get saying blowing way proportion damaged bodily systems recovery etc. since people go thorugh without even realizing infected. This.

Social media given crazy anti-science birds place flock together reinforce other's views. pretty crazy, conservative jumping joy decisions made local level. Japan pursuing suppression strategy, like every successful nation except New Zealand. 124 cases trigger new state emergency context.

Note apparatus tests virus would breathed behind mask thus speaks personal protection different masks. might surprise you. 

N95 - 99.98% effective blocking spread aerosols (these course microscopic ""droplets"" spread covid)

Surgical - 97.14% effective

4 layers paper towel w/ 1 layer cloth - 95.15% effective

Conclusions - masks raise awareness reduce touching face reduce aerosol transmission significant rates. 
Homemade masks noted breathable paper towels replaced frequently, advantage since ""filter"" replaced multiple times day cheap. 

They effective using cloth less paper towels conjunction. 
*This one might comfortable wear extended periods time.  clearly read studies full, misrepresented cherry-picked sentences conclusions.

Long, Y. et al literally concluded ""N95 respirators **provided protective effect**
against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization,"" protective effect N95 mask higher protective effect surgical mask, authors recommend N95s surgical masks.

Radonovich, et al. drew conclusion: could establish ""no significant **difference** effectiveness N95 respirators medical masks preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza."" study address whether masks provide protection infection, whether either N95s surgical masks conclusively **more effective** type, real world practice.

Smith, et al.: Again, thing: study compared N95 surgical masks, found neither effective practice. Whether masks provide better protection masks adressed all.

bin-Reza, et al. *did* actually conclude none studies reviewed conclusively established protective effective mask use, compared mask use, represent correctly. However, none studies isolated mask use variable, future studies comparing mask use mask use unlikely, since mask use routine clinical settings, unlikely suspended.

Cowling et al. agreed bin-Reza review: there's little evidence existing literature supports claim wearing masks provides protection flu infection wearing masks, literally find experimental studies investigated question. also note equal effectiveness N95s surgical masks protecting wearer environment.

The Jacobs et al. study laughably inconclusive, actually *does* directly investigate mask vs mask question: people less likely catch cold, regularly wear mask? Two groups sixteen health care workers, one wearing masks work, one wearing masks, followed four years. 2 (two) colds recorded four years, one mask group, one no-mask group. course, establish masks effective, establishes nothing all. Womp womp.


You said ""Every single RTC found provide protective benefit."" Well, systematic reviews linked state *aren't any* good RCTs investigating mask vs mask question all, thus, studies provided evidence masks effective. None posted concluded masks ""provide protective benefit"", absence evidence do; absence evidence evidence absence. And, finally, one review (Long et al.) literally states masks provide protection. whole point warp speed? ramp production? email Maricopa County Public Health official due experience trying get kid tested.

lol South. Florida thing without care. Students Alabama literally creating betting pools actively trying catch Covid19. 

Let's even talk federal government, Rand Paul's terrible questions Dr. Fauci. Rand Paul literal proof study want degree still fucking moron.

Cheers. never see pictures ""overwhelmed hospitals"", though... may true now, likely last long. Take look hospitalization numbers right side table, we‚Äôve exponentially increasing terms hospitalizations. Peak hospitalization earlier 60k US whole. Last Tuesday 30k, close baseline, we‚Äôre 37k.

I still bet lands somewhere 0.5-0.7. comparison flu often cited 0.1, number calculated based symptomatic patients. Similar antibody studies shown flu may upwards 75% asymptomatic, meaning TRUE IFR may low 0.02-0.04 flu I'm literally sitting watching unfold, hardly able believe eyes. hard see could gone worse there.

I mean, USA. response raise confidence. exists. called decent educational system. humans good world. blame selfish people. side child example? I've read, even people exhibiting overt symptoms still get mild inflammation lung damage, would argue organ damage far hospitalized. 

Mild inflammation ""lung damage"" typical post viral syndrome, occur following episodes bronchitis flu well. entirely uncommon feel gassed weeks even months afterwards. asymptomatic people exactly that, asymptomatic illness. COVID-19 magical. saying permanent, evidence seems pretty clear fucks average symptomatic person average person flu bronchitis.

Of course does. world taking seriously we're standing waiting vaccine. binary, case ""every mild case get severe lung damage"" ""the virus joke"". People understate risks, overstate either. Clarity information important. United States affected culturally social media. completely wrecked discourse tbh. Quite turnaround considering last week said business could enforce wearing masks. But, hey, we‚Äôll take it!

Also, went pick food bar/bbq place packed, masks. wait, people! They've done studies wearing mask affect oxygen saturation levels one damn bit. complete pearl clutching bullshit people claim can't breathe mask, meanwhile surgeons wearing hours time heart surgeries etc. Shit, get vaccinated, family vaccinated, that's enough me.

I astounded many people tried get you. seriously doubt see anything FBS also seriously doubt see many FBS schools play season. There's millions TV endorsement dollars stake. read article OP posted. NY 1,035 new cases increase percentage positive. concerning we've seen fast spreads. Thailand much poorer country EU, can't afford another outbreak. would stupid suddenly undo good work. 

While tourism important Thailand, depend it. International tourism around 12% GDP.. important sectors, manufacturing. source back envelope math would make plausible (though I‚Äôd say unlikely - people would change habits long got control... I‚Äôd hope). Anyhow, Texas pop 29M x 0.6 get herd immunity x observed NYC IFR 0.014 comes around quarter million deaths Texas. NYC didn‚Äôt exceed hospital capacity. IFR goes up, way up, people can‚Äôt get care. 

But I‚Äôd really surprised Texans kept merrily obliviously living life like normal ICUs crushed bodies pushed mass graves bulldozers. Normal human behavior keep numbers lower that. Let us lesson everyone else things. Florida needs next bold strategy, let's see works long testing keep up, 100k basically baked point.

And obviously real number new cases probably *is* 100,000 per day more. Possible but...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! North Houston‚Äîthe district teach looking two plans.

Besides never really locked down. state phase two reopening, stores open, restaurants open, restrictions. wear mask keep safe distance. difficult. problem many idiots think sensible safety measures kind plot would rather risk health health others take simple precautions. 

Frankly I‚Äôm fed people acting like children ruining things rest us adults. Gotta love right wing, acknowledged deaths decline despite cases surging three weeks ago. Suck cock People die year flu, go business usual flu season regardless. Err...because public health official knows contain Covid. one even dare say contained. Fauci forgot \*allowed\* Covid perpetuate? ‚ÄúAmericans always right thing, they‚Äôve tried everything else‚Äù

My go COVID sites.  Florida thing People forget BLS makes numbers based surveys. actually counting based filings. call small sample people ask actively looking job. say looking (why would look middle pandemic nobody hiring???), considered ""out workforce"" counted unemployment.

Also remember Trump knows well important stats (he used accuse Obama manipulating employment numbers) doubt packed BLS early administration people loyal him.

The numbers BLS released month last month stupidly absurd stupid people would believe them. casinos opened without required masks, thought going get nasty. felt bad employees.

Kind like can't repurpose soda factory produce contact lense fluid. mean still 500 cases day agree, wont drop til vaccine travel open. 500 cases manageable minimum deaths. tracking app minimise spread further. projection vaccine's ready around November (4 months now) .. 500 cases x 30 days x 4 months = 60k cases total .. US numbers one day germany find 4 months. Inevitably, people something stupid need hospital care.

They may forced wait hours ambulance arrives. one arrives, might drive hours find hospital room admit them.

And drive themselves, prepared call several hospitals determine room.

If area bad yet, wait, may be. It‚Äôs reply comment thread get it. Sweden gone epidemic peak number cases deaths dropped much lower numbers. could avoided lot deaths adopting different strategy start changing seems pointless. 

At stage seem managing ok. Surely carry version social distancing, add contact tracing wait vaccine like everyone disagree protests increased spread look real data US, weak sauce. Majoirty largest protest cities seeing minimal increases cases.

Hand washing constantly became norm easily worry adding classroom routines. 

However, 'big kids' really good listeners trying follow social distancing rules, still awful it. ask every two three minutes back playing, two minutes still bunch back up. 

These toddlers, kids learning challenges behavioral issues, 30 room. still utter crap.

Now imagine machine needs 300 copies detect positive initial sample one copy. longer test, chance detecting it. Florida too. people know said something like ""I socially distancing months now, deserve break."" go party. discouraging means fear mongering ""have fallen liberal agenda.""

Brief Summary¬†¬†

This phase 1 followed phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter study evaluate safety, reactogenicity, tolerability immunogenicity Whole-Virion Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) healthy volunteers.¬†

The study designed evaluate safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, immunogenicity three groups healthy volunteers receive two intramuscular doses BBV152 vaccine formulations.¬†A total sample size 1125 healthy volunteers, 375 ages ‚â•18-‚â§55 phase 1 study 750 ages ‚â•12-‚â§65 phase 2 study (4:1 test control).


Phase¬†1:


Group 1¬†

A total 125 subjects enrolled Group 1 receive two intramuscular doses BBV152A control vaccine 4:1 ratio.¬†The two doses administered 14 days apart. Upon completion 7 days post-vaccination 50 participants Group 1 (either test control), Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), review available data, recommend progression towards next cohort. Thereafter, participants enrolled higher dose cohort (Group 2, 3), continuation remaining participants Group 1.


Group 2

¬†A total 125 subjects enrolled Group 2 receive two intramuscular doses BBV152B control vaccine 4:1 ratio. two doses administered 14 days apart.


¬†Group 3: total 125 subjects enrolled Group 3 receive two intramuscular doses BBV152C control vaccine 4:1 ratio. two doses administered 14 days apart.


After completion 7 days post 2nd dose vaccination Day 28, immunogenicity &amp; safety Groups 1, 2, 3 reviewed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommend progression towards next Phase trial. interim report based safety immunogenicity three formulations Group 1, Group 2 Group 3 notified Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), India, progressing clinical development vaccine. interim report contain detailed analysis data based primary secondary objectives visits Day 28 (Immunogenicity &amp; Safety). ultimate goal selection safe, well-tolerated, immunogenic intramuscular vaccine, further, evaluated phase 2 study.¬†


Phase 2:


Phase 2 study total 750 healthy volunteers age ‚â•12 ‚â§65 years enrolled study vaccinated day 0 day 14 selected formulation (X1 X2) based endpoints Phase 1 study. Since age group differs Phase 1, upon completion enrolment vaccination 50 participants Cohort 1 (X1), cohort 2 (X2) per randomization, safety assessment conducted seven days vaccination. study product deemed safe based DSMB review, participants enrolled.

In week's time, we'll probably another 100,000 new cases go back lockdown. Anti-vaccine propaganda quite rare outside US USA USA USA! Additionally, de funding police mean get rid police. means spreading funds around police charge things law enforcement instead giving police funds people like social workers drug/alcohol rehabilitation programs, etc. He‚Äôs made decide buy Tesla, matter badly want one. I‚Äôll shittier EV next. Yep. multiple states tried pass bills saying creationism taught schools. Thank god Edwards v. Aguillard made unconstitutional that. They‚Äôre rationing water moment drought. 100,000 going water shut every day. It‚Äôs Chipotle, man. Punish Chipotle. It‚Äôs right there. 
Just enforce no-mask, no-use rule bathroom door. Studies carry weight. one's methodology bad one rely anything says regard (if does, strongly suspect assertions article
were invented journalist).

We studies show children exceedingly unlikely infect anyone, based hundreds case-studies looking infection history involving children. much better job studying particular question.

If question whether children carriers virus, suppose one gets honorable mention.  mean, do, strange assume guy doesnt. Also strange annoyed someone suggesting cops wear masks work. mean, it‚Äôs like least thing paid protect public (that job, right?). Also, wear sorts uncomfortable gear, mask less uncomfortable bulletproof vest problem wearing those.

I wear n95 8 hours day regular mask 13 hours day (the times overlap due policy work need wear normal mask cover n95) . worn properly (been fit tested n95). rest time apartment live alone. Yea it‚Äôs bit hassle, it‚Äôs important it.

Does mean complain people wearing masks? fuck everyone doesnt wear appropriately. cases increasing, deaths decreasing. trend likely continue. Remember people look back history Hospitalizations still steadily increasing US, percentage positive tests also increasing, suggest rise cases purely due increased testing. Thanks, say still detectable masks surfaces 7th day though reading wrong?

Masks textiles like clothes. shit w Texas frankly state didn‚Äôt shit first place I‚Äôve really well setting bourbon lately. 

Last night showed can‚Äôt always handle responsibility bottle haha. Nothing bad happened, downed 2/3 it. phone conversation brother wish would bit sober for, alas, didn‚Äôt fuck nothin Yeah good cities. applying critical thinking world around you.

When china shut exports 100% back November pretty clear coming without hand held.  don‚Äôt mean Debbie downer, usually deaths lagging positive cases couple weeks. see. Good. scores assess privilege test-taking ability anything else. student whose parents hired SAT tutor six months learned effective test-taking strategies dramatic advantage student studied flash cards free time, significant test anxiety work night exam. Seriously, though, every online video I've seen thus far someone making fuss masks woman.

plus come think can't speak personal experience sources tell women attempt dissuade men they're intimate condom use alarmingly common, too. Ayyad tested positive COVID-19 Influenza A. placed ventilation transferred Johns Hopkins breathing grew worse.¬†

Flu season going terrifying.

 Americans prepared hell coming way. Ok I'll bite...why would ""10x worse"" Hillary compared Trump? Waco we're getting ""first wave"". Shit's crazy states need this! really way vaccine, plus efficacy new vaccine questionable. Maybe protests? Well soon escalated. mind stuck auto-immune disorder long? one knows p. Yeah posting history strange. There's comments talks real threat vast majority saying way overblown, conspiracy, etc. really sure make it. Dogs bark loudly weak bites. 26, cannot confirm Oh is, gonna get much much worse. Yeeeeee..... ... (flatline) DT Texas thing ever. Lol course treatment expected run cool 3,500$ don‚Äôt feel sorry misguided fool. get gat. I'm sorry hear loss parents, lost mother dearest heart month ago Covid. absolutely broken heart best friend. last minute kidney transplant recovering weeks prior contracting making much difficult us knowing new lease life life taken away nowhere.

I'm exactly sure how's best way grieve told time help us move forward spirit always remain us everywhere go. Hang there, I'm going keep telling too. Sometimes wonder happened spring breakers Florida. fun games kill someone's Nana. You‚Äôre pretty much describing National coronavirus strategy. goodness, we've weeks protest law enforcement think people going take well arrested. agree happened sooner, I'm sure would ever work. Americans seem like forced obey law. So, countries like USA Brazil trying lockdown thing? totally question even though situation worse ever? Apparently, kinda work Europe. Technically, skin cancer kind side effect mega dosing vitamin sun. think us walking around jerks. Naw, worth it. Let's ""muh freedom"" another Depression, reasonable trade off. /s Heard news today. 10k people refused get tested tin foil hat. YEEEEEEEE HAWWWWW! Florida: Lets celebrate everyone invited. said mountain**s** i.e. plural.

It would take long name all. Go kiss feet 20 year old Chinese overlords Cough Cough virus tell wife love 20 percent chance needing hospitalization already minor cold cough cough I‚Äôm going die Fucking hell, another naive child. recent events US taught nothing? ""freedoms"" US people, ""privileges"". privileges suspended.

Corporations-shmorporations, government fucking slow recognize threat nose US holds Grand Prize COVID this, maybe bloody violent revolution

Oh shut fuck up. Government send domestic army tanks shit fucking steamroll direct revolt. reason done yet protesters less understand apply firearms escalate things violence. 99% sure Michael Scott quote. record-breaking event anyone proud misleading title. Florida found 10,000 new COVID-19 cases single day. somehow even terrifying. let‚Äôs forget death toll hospitals reach full capacity now. hospitals filling up, expect see death toll start rise faster.  Wow, that‚Äôs crazy. might agree author CDC overestimating flu deaths convince people care flu. mean admitted lied us effectiveness masks people wouldn‚Äôt take away healthcare workers.

It might also help answer question bugging quite while. question 2009 H1N1 pandemic estimated killed 150,000-575,000 people around world without world realizing something wrong. high end estimate toll comparable pandemic far, albeit somewhat longer period time probably evenly distributed toll across countries due lack differing control measures. Still many deaths would expected remember reading articles hard-hit areas seeing crushed hospital systems, overwhelmed burial services, experiencing striking increases overall mortality, etc. However, unsurprising things didn‚Äôt happen much see number lab-confirmed deaths 18,449. Maybe lots people weren‚Äôt tested flu strain specifically, makes wonder H1N1 estimate bogus pandemic really unprecedented afiak, opened everything - restaurants, bars, clubs, etc. videos saw, packed one social distancing. 

People neighbouring states going Arizona party heard ""open."" Coronavirus showing ugly humanity male karen got pissed got last paper towel:/ toilet paper stalked around store made scene employees something me.

walking away powerful looks ‚Äúweak‚Äù smart makes sound like bad guy walk away like innocent bystander make look like asshole 

i think coronavirus scary insight humanity survive future outbreaks. specifically don‚Äôt think americans survive problems doctors door hospital letting people in.

COVID19 attacks lungs (and heart too, think?). obese person already organs working higher capacity, makes much harder survive illness requires organs more. bodies can't take it. also, excess fat causes higher rates inflammations. 

Basically, might healthy paper could fine decades more... strain organs already there, illness attacks organs, they're basically toast. know doctors say mild, mean ""anything require ventilator hospital admittance,"" right? case considered mild case. case mild case, even though *did* horrible breathing problems still linger months later, essentially bedridden three weeks.

Tyrannical fucktards really really hate weaponization concept science things little it. fuck zombies flocking bars global disease outbreak wtf wrong species lot people comments mix um positive rate tests vs positive rate population. important distinguish evaluating benefits pool testing.

in general: would pool samples patients experiencing symptoms expect high rate positives. limited testing capacities often indicator tests done one patients likely infected. that's end 20% positive rates (only testing people already pretty sure it).

if pooled testing, could people experience symptoms (if makes sense another discussion scientific community). 20% positive test rate mean 20% population positive (again, 20% sick high risk people test positive - testing enough!). 

if general population 5% positive, limited pooled testing could make sense increase testing capacity group.

as someone tests lab (in europe though) main problem pooling 10 samples. sounds great 1/10th tests, also reduced sensitivity tests 10 fold. either diluting sample 9 samples. one positive would lower range detection level, chances high miss diluted pool. approaches mix swabs collect swabs solution, thus increasing total volume diluting it. also impact sensitivity, main problem timing: one sample 10 people. comes back positive, individual samples. need collected tested again. something take days weeks (find everybody tested, get swabs, send lab, wait analysis, etc.). pooled testing could increase time takes first swab result dramatically. 

based points decided lab 4 plex pooling individual samples. pool comes back positive, individual samples include next run, delaying overall result maximum 12 hours time reducing sensitivity factor 4 (which equals 2 cycles qPCR machine fine protocol).

Elsewhere course. Jeepers. anyone learn ANYTHING new Vox article? Sure, deny effective combatant. agree that! However, I'm convinced go back normal (especially things like big indoor crowds totally normally etc) wearing masks, that's all. think masks miracle cure, effective important measure. Boss Dog. We're paying every day ""The bomb room set explode minus 10 cause concern!"" This. government say months ahead time schools closed they'd spend time redneck militia parading around capital. least postponing announcement postpone protests comes right it. That's really goos idea. easily way buy snacks/food someone bring car. nation full people care think won‚Äôt happen them.  Shuttered restaurants? thought make cure worse disease. To? From? world huge, yet nearly daily post one company wrong crisis. see two reasons might happen:

- Option 1: Tesla terrible working conditions - among worst world. order mentioned daily basis, would terrible companies, including factories. Personally, feel individual company even important enough mentioned global forum pandemic all, that's another story.
- Option 2: group people trying promote bad news Tesla. Either hate company personally sponsored someone want Tesla succeed. 

I sure working factory always nice. However, Tesla factory really worst world terms managing crisis?

Regarding second option, sure lot people companies financial interest seeing Tesla succeed. lot money made selling gasoline combustion-engine cars.

So, arguing article wrong. However personally believe cause daily news articles caused option 2 option 1. settle fears may have, Antibodies aren‚Äôt part fighting Meanwhile US excess weekly deaths 5k *below* average suspect they‚Äôre enormous pressure threat FLs insane Governor.

Yeah, sure giant corporation scared shitless governor, especially one party that's well known bending backwards corporations. 

I think understand who's calling shots US who's standing attention hope getting ""campaign funds"". Isnt UK worse per capita death wise us. I'm fine it, arent great either. learning process quite slow. ICU beds filling rate positive test results? current estimates seem range anywhere 0.12 1.1

The upper end bit higher that, I've seen estimates 2 %. 

O.12 % absolutely impossible; way 100 % population New York State Lombardy would infected already.

When cross excess deaths New York State percentage infected serological studies, get IFR 1.4 %, data Worldometers.

I think said done, IFR Western countries probably around 1%. Could bit lower poorer countries younger population. Uh oh joe rogan gonna flip out. r/shitamericanssay Yes, that‚Äôs science based projection works. Kind like weather forecast next Friday change conditions change. We're #19! We're #19! lot governments around world said official stance WHO. People still realized initial procrastination 1-2 weeks implementing lockdown happened. (Several countries.) People fully realize exponential means. didn‚Äôt, right thing provided proper attribution. thought Canadian? first grade teacher opinion kids wearing mask? mask wearing family don‚Äôt trust 6 year olds ability wear one day properly. also think desperately needs around kids direct teaching provided online learning. need good shape walk around sing stage  feel smug writing this!

Embarrassing. brain isn‚Äôt working either get work stop typing.

Gigantic brain ‚ÄûLOOOL NY DEATH HIGH BAD LOOOL LOCKDOWN BAD‚Äú instead realising actually happened, hit first, testing unprepared. like Italy Spain understand sentiment, unless written laws governing area, family right.

If only. host dies, virus dies it! That's correct, generally something outdoors people wear masks, there's problem. absolutely could reopen 90+% people took precautions. Unfortunately 1 3 people think Trump genius germ theory hoax. That's true, studies shows even surgical masks clearly provide protection wearer. Sure, good n95, saying protect wrong.   always hopeful, can't really plan exactly virus mutate. Also, could still end multiple strains coronavirus circulating around worse version never really going away. Also, whole mutation thing takes many generations changes, virus far still seems pretty stable. Mutations also make vaccine development difficult, yes could mutate less lethal aggressive, would harder pin down. That's social distancing isolation greatest vaccine ...it works every virus. need weekend getaway obtain eggs milk. Also, processed water? boil. president doesnt power tell states reopen. remember, even one case caused protesters. fact, need travel anywhere hiring protesters go me, scientifically proven way protect virus. come downvote bots.........gotta stay line narrative

You're helping anyone realize... believe you. love you! Bring us back normal lives! Good article. Thanks archiving it. Statistically though, stuck consistently refuse vaccines... That's flu plus pneumonia, FYI, much deadlier flu alone. Watch press briefing yourself. last comments 2 July brief: working group discussions regarding human-animal barrier. domestic animals also farmed animals. particularly relevant area study new disease identified pigs. Come-on people, get numbers up! Up! Up!

We're going better rest world something, even kills us. Wall Street journal article. bypassed paywall. rich afford kids go work teenagers. Uh no. hit 60k cases today, 63k probably max week see slight dip Sunday-tuesday, see start hitting 80k next week. 100k possible next week depends testing. 
 
Even locked now, harder before, still see 100k peak. Good strategy. Increase infectivity first, wait till everyone upgrading severity. UBI kind thing US would refuse introduce even first world nations already decades, know, like worker's rights, consumer protection, universal healthcare, paid maternity leave,...

I would *not* want employee working main gate turns people away visibly ill. spending hundreds dollars get Orlando world, guest ( parent) going admit feeling sick turn around go home without major fight. Yes. everyone stays home society get needs?

Chicken?

Still?

... Yeh things going well South Africa good monitor (excess deaths) give better idea impact pandemic less open deliberate accidental incorrect classification. German MD (Internal medicine/GP). confirm. testing less see fairly infected people more. testing everyone flu like symptoms, symptoms cold/ loss smell. Therefore test rate much lower March April. time percentage tests coming back positive around 20% (testing criteria much stricter though), 1positive 6 weeks.
Social distancing works. masks. think second Chinese, Germans, Canadians, etc., position did, won't. America help itself, cannot help rest world. everybody's interest Americans get priority covid-19 drug. briefing summer outside Tuesdays Thursdays, currently 127 people ICU covid19.

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

I‚Äôm left Obama last night found pining President Hilary Clinton start manufacturing 7 billion √ó 17 vaccines hope one approved?
We limited less 1B year terms manufacturing capability. forgot get together's like last weekend's gay pride march Chicago. 

 1 6,000 Americans tested positive today?? love real life data happens use peak compared average.  puritanical streak here. people would wear masks indoors, we're fine. outdoor stuff zero scientific basis I‚Äôm Riverside. really wish sheriff would commit kind enforcement here. Honestly, best thing could happen NBA NFL cancel seasons. Now. NBA canceled season March, that's everyone freaked places started closing. - and, importantly, NFL canceled - might work again. It‚Äôs free daycare. sad. Expect record setting spike early September. I'm mad Dr. Acton OH resign. Even governor flat said ""The buck stops me, sign stuff"" kept harassing her. Ohio done OK job people targeted absolutely terrible. Also, stupid. lol. Positivity rate # positive Covid 19 tests DIVIDED # tests administered. let's say test 100 people 10 positive. That's positivity rate 10%

Statistically want see rate high, indicates testing enough. 

Because average person infected, quarantine, infects least 2 others, means there's people spreading COVID likely unaware even positive.

This article recommends positivity rate 5%. keep testing get 5% positivity.  Why?  know downvotes.... You‚Äôre going tell conservative old lady she‚Äôll look like man? 1% almost zero. fucking matter was. actually distress signal. summon emergency services, please, unless want whole 9 yards law enforcement show up, fly flag upside down. isn‚Äôt paper says all. article really shockingly dishonest. study linked below. abstract reads:

‚ÄúChildren seem drive transmission severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). isolated culture-competent virus vitro 12 (52%) 23 SARS-CoV-2‚Äìinfected children; youngest 7 days old. findings show symptomatic neonates, children, teenagers shed infectious SARS-CoV-2, suggesting transmission plausible‚Äù

They studied 12 children, OBSERVE TRANSMISSION, concluded transmission ‚Äúplausible‚Äù. course it‚Äôs ‚Äúplausible‚Äù, question whether children spread well adults. article makes conclusion study thin air. Truly definition fake news. reality 10% death rate unable obtain hospital care (eg. Italy) punch people face real quickly. 100k day September. Haha thanks! I‚Äôve trying control things world coping mechanism. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Put way: close 3 million positive tests, tens millions projected actual infections, death someone 21 makes national news. Florida's infections rising month. deaths decreasing. Unless suggesting 5-week lag. data suggests that. see graphs. [Show 5-week Wants Live Forever? lot true hardly hospital states fault. US robust infection control systems policies possible sudden stress supplies staff. handful patients would single room occupancy n95 masks. ED using nearly 100x(!!) number n95s normally does, began rationing. Single occupancy rooms would luxury hospital ~125% capacity. Offices, outpatient surgery centers detox unit converted hospital beds. ICU expanded 8x normal number ventilated patients (which would required 8x number trained staff).

Honestly reasonable disaster management plan would blown water whole thing.

Return work stuff became running joke.... Initially robust exposure/quarantine rules rolled out, quickly realized basically half ED staff would sick sustainable. 

Everything (vents, transfers, masks, isolation, quarantine) work great 5% patients it, 80%+

We actually great experience FEMA ventilators. little bit butt clench every morning (""we 4 vents left hospital, 5 expected evening""). think using 60 one point.

I absolutely agree over-emphasis vents. Vents save people, 2 weeks ICU care vent saves people. make shifts ICUs utter insanity. Non critical care nurses managing multiple intubated patients, trying manage medication pumps know use (many ICU medicines doses titrated discretion ICU nurse... takes considerable training).

Our hospital hit genuine saturation. point ventilators simply nurse doctor manage 2 week ICU course recovery. ED come terms less aggressive ventilators.

TLDR: honestly think hospitals best could. I'm sure much disaster planning place I'm shocked overwhelmed.  took Trump long call new orders. Alabama awesome. Fun fact...it 4th biodiversity state! Cops area wearing masks either. climate, think they'd whatever could improve public image, can't even bothered simply wear mask. really surprising though, given pathetically low qualifications become cop types people drawn job. literally never stepped foot Alabama, I'm Michigan crazy non-Corona deaths mysteriously lower normal... love Dr.Fauci keeps cool. great guy

 F (Respect++) Shocker right? one things problem real. percentage tests coming back positive Florida intolerably high. 

We‚Äôve seen charts showing rise cases recent weeks. virtual certainty fewer new infections nationwide right peak epidemic mid April. mid-April almost 20% tests coming back positive, whereas figure around 7%. difference we‚Äôre vastly testing. Looking trends percent positive better way model progress epidemic.

This news demonstrates point quite nicely. 10,000 cases FL certainly eye-popping headline. Along 10,000 cases 67 deaths. first day New York posted 10,000 cases (April 3) 629 deaths‚Äîalmost 10 times many! virus 1/10 deadly now? 10x many tests? Either way first week July Florida nothing like first week April New York. 

For months we've clamoring testing, testing ramped up, we're hammering governors rising cases. doubt epidemic getting worse, metric proves rise percentage tests coming back positive, raw number cases.

Testing helps us understand parameters outbreaks, we're creating situation governors going respond perverse incentives. I'm governor would rather see headlines say ""People can't get tested"" headlines say ""Infections SPIKING""? political reasons could see governors scale back testing media's Pavlovian obsession using new cases shock value. would bad.

Devoid context, raw number cases worthless metric people absolutely ignore it. caNaDA 1/10th PopULaTiOn! /s Outside? salad sounds awesome. appreciate light dinner balanced dessert. Didn‚Äôt already lose leg two? poor guy getting fucked hard virus. Outlier fuck going on?!  Pfizer disclosed start making right now, expected delivery 100 million doses October, 1,2 billion end 2021. speculation hospitalization rates 2% ish way off. made shit up.

Your criticism others people data seems mostly like crap. Please shove off. never catch us, Brazil!!! love we're pretending season really going happen. Mass delusion finest. happened NYC less also. zero confirm.

My worst guests usually young 20-23ish males South Korea also incredible contact tracing program. daughter lives already report whereabouts contacts multiple times happened ~slightly close known exposure, risk virtually nil. sure Japan program South Korea keeps small outbreaks quickly quashed testing contact tracing. mindset sorry People also forget DeBlasio tried enact ""shelter place"" thing NYC - essentially full city shut down, Cuomo refused allow (even derided it) ... almost week later finally shut whole state took complete credit it.

That extra week could've saved LOT lives. called religious grandma lives Texas ask going church, wearing mask, staying safe, etc. Seems still going church begrudgingly wears mask there, security guard enforcing lol. laughed, good them. token, surviving disease lifelong impairment exactly win, either. agree that, especially economic system, wealth measurable effect health well disastrous economic downturn hurt lot people. However economy rebound time workers stay healthy, best solution states spiking shut temporarily providing economic relief need it. Easter year? think there's big overlap think. /r/prepper subreddit pretty diverse crowd conspiracy-ish. literally talk things ready for, potential problems coming up, skills have, practice using stuff, keep water long term, etc. super practical community prepared shit like this. I've never seen conspiracy talk there.

The reason hear crazy doomsday preppers they're ones make news. weird shit get reported on. normal preppers talk let people know prep. That's part - try really hard make sure preps secret, shit hit fan, everyone knows months worth food water medicine batteries etc. hear someone prepping, they're news become public, they're failing major aspect prepping, bottom line. Preppers practical prepared disaster get famous. So... America point need decide attempt treat based quality life? 


What fuck? Must nice living shithole country, eh? America lost plot. I‚Äôd suspicious someone offered someone late 1800s. remember saw clip? wonder women get criticized ""bitchy."" bad enough office building. swear time someone comes work contagious goes around office like wildfire. job piles vacation time sick time together - great never get sick. people coming work *knowing* sick called out, wouldn‚Äôt enough PTO disney trip leaving week two.

Thanks disney plague bearer half team got sick, including coming middle cross country move. currently 750,000 canadians living America. move back? close 0. masks don‚Äôt work right? They‚Äôre way show lack support Trump? rest world figured out, people want proudly ignorant. It‚Äôs truly baffling. treated like regular Americans Insanity... 36, graduated bachelor's Engineering. daughter second grade fall I'm really loss do. really depending second income starting ASAP knows WTF childcare like next year. mean, almost statistics point problem America ignorance correct procedures, intentional negligence best-practices, sake bottom line.
How punish Corporations Government? create Human Slaves tortured Machine. this, maybe bloody violent revolution... Don‚Äôt bother. ass post history blaming ny. It‚Äôs new China. protests. whatever makes feel better placing blame boogeyman. prefer exponential data linear data? yep going like miracle, even anything, it'll magically go away like flu. places like Hawaii implemented system get tested days prior traveling. electronic health records available Hawaii health officials due waiver signed traveler purpose. 

Many counties similar restrictions place decades, screening TB, HIV amongst endemic diseases. can't travel cleared. 

So outside realm possibilities. know American contagious.  give face mask American flag undoubtedly problem, may viable approach. Thing is, necessarily require anyone opt in. that's whole lot worse. Probably get covid now. thing black couple trying avoid. people don‚Äôt give fuck anything JFC... We're doomed species. deflecting know it. Yeesh! Enjoy trip. Safe travels! Pretty badass vampire hunter too!  Arkansas. article annoyed heck me. one, read like diary entry. bad? Yeah EVERY PERSON PLANET right now.

Now I'm trying blame living best life. article offered absolutely nothing constructive, suggestions, I'm even sure complaining about. want schools open closed?

The real problem us living pre covid mindset. clinging believes earned owed society, covid shattered that. contract exist time being, it. 

Yes none us thought lives would state today, yes serious challenges schools closed, leadership plan currently, alternative? happens teacher, administrator, janitor parent (God forbid) kid dies getting covid school (as already happened NYC dozens times already)? know value human life is, I'm pretty sure food blog. 2003? sure mean Ebola

But yeah, agree. think pretty much anyone would handled better. thing understand Fauci, Birx, et al know you, take lead. Trump can't seem get past though ever left U.S.? Probably not. Needs crime like knowingly spreading HIV. live Mexico city?

I've heard mixed opinions this. heard people easy get test, people easy.

You're really grasping straws now. spread others? fuck think ""cohort "" means? r/agedlikemilk What's hilarious bunch MAGA masks Etsy, Trump Co. dumb enough think somebody else got profit them. Odd waited long something like that.

Your victimhood complex pathetic. Yup. America's entire healthcare system going severe PTSD end this.

It's upsetting people making decisions, PLUS get guilt, reward willing go trenches try HELP.

The time show support HCP clapping shift change. skipping family birthday parties happening first place, refusing go bar hopping friends, remembering wear mask time. good news considering I'm forced go Florida couple days. No, option stay home. family making go I'm 15 let say no.  OK, know talking talking about?

Edit: Oh parsed comment talking mideast drone strikes. reading something ""pretty faced drone"" Ok, get it. want talk administration misdeeds trying divert blame Trump.  It‚Äôs funny, March terrified getting grocery, hand sanitizer masks wasn‚Äôt worried, last week I‚Äôm back March, worse. killed Doyle, like non mask-wearing people vulnerable segments population mean ""Why US needs new Financial Political System.""

How punish Corporations Government? create Human Slaves tortured Machine. Oh boy. think we're getting started. sure rest state, tests free available anyone NYC. Everyone encouraged get test even symptoms. friend mine visited urgent care clinic rash day got COVID test already could. people- kid people! Yes!

There needs freedom speech press, even they're saying bullshit. otherwise healthy, Broadway actor shows 6 days week. tremendous shape. pretend know me.

Looking NZ like  agree. hope remains way too, it‚Äôs much ‚Äúreal‚Äù. people work, ‚Äúbusiness people‚Äù. county announced days ago would stop reporting numbers weekend.

Any reason they‚Äôre that? know lot cities / states around country trying cut working hours public employees kinds due massive crippling budget shortfalls. Lt. Idiot let's sacrifice elders keep economy going faction...  Pretty sure comment removed say Ob*ma. Also...there people waited months still can't taste smell! mean kill ya joy suck sure. It‚Äôs contradictory - sounds like they‚Äôre saying science shows kids don‚Äôt seem spread virus much, impossible could so. 100% life choice all. Obesity complex issue entirely disingenuous say life choice. make point. Consider gentleman article. Would obese lived 200 years ago? No. Society changed. humans meant access things do. Constant easy access sugar calories. What's like lying right wing scumbag? people literal evil pieces people human garbage would rather people die wrong. literal scum humanity.

Also, like right wing scum argue point made. Neither original poster said anything hospitalization RATE. 100,000 people infected hospitalization rate 20% fucked regardless rate staying same. worst part even though wasn‚Äôt taken seriously, actually *did* slow virus little. definitely didn‚Äôt see curve drop like similar conditions countries, least wasn‚Äôt climbing. Remember folks, kill completely, basically zero. never mind health consequences, bills, lost work, consequences: dead, count.

This epidemic real whirlwind terms human empathy. Yeah, basically every doc country suggests outside, especially day sun, fine point. inside lot people talking extended period spreads thing. many sheep ass pussies sub. Good luck new world order gulags come. Ah fair, Jesse Ventura candidate.

Great job deflecting BTW. different views even people think they‚Äôre dumb live Florida amount people DONT take serious astounding. literally scary fucking stupid majority every one here. article, looks like infected flew back new house L.A. pick belongings right NYC outbreak. damn horrible lost leg *still* long way go. fucking scary. anyone enlighten relevance 2016 election graph? think President showed backbone told straight changed narrative could different?

 would covid positive worker continue working? 

 fuck wrong people? believe single word saying. I'm sure plenty people Wall Street would, start raising money. know someone could help. u/elizabethholmes got tips?  agree. Fine people.

I've watched people, including wife, wear unproperly constantly touch remove order talk someone.

The federal government helping spread good information way really needs spread. People misinformed president even seen one.

People literally die wearing one. insane. But, thin cloth face prevents freedom entering body! Mostly southern conservative, probably coincidence. Tell protects vaccines ""We beat without government taking away rights""

Completely true. Absolutely true. 100% truthiness!

The thing is: people gonna people, individualism hive mind. Without government closing opportunities congregate, individualism ultimately stop spread. 

Until/unless citizens actually accept hive mind ""wear masks time"", ""don't congregate like did"", going away. fully expect FL get much worse April, much sooner. Covid end Australia, foreign travel permitted notice. Exactly. aiming [controlled burn towards herd obviously lead greater burden infection since point slowly surely spread infection population order get herd immunity. Meh... go space? would still TTI regardless implement two minutes two decades pandemic. strategy, different timings. timing implement strategy changes degree explained clearly now, going say thing yet another time?

Thanks article. quite interesting. think something privacy quarantine protocalls reporters/photographers walking ICUs hospital rooms take pictures, think there's conspiracy lie number current patients? Yes, comparing drag-net surveillance laws forced quarantine, singling particular businesses deeming essential non-essential totally arbitrary metrics. none go checks balances government instead dictated single office. declaring ""end date"" mandates. 

I'm wearing mask, I'm everyone sub cheering authoritarianism. throughout history always done guise ""public safety"". still important, no? voted understand. I'm going keep hoping something changes better everyone making hard choices. find checking news vaccine's progress lot.

Now? I'll grab something go (would prefer curbside) that's it... shit's getting hairy real quick here. That's feature people. Honestly, unless actually gone college, taken statistics make sense numbers one way another, says less stupidity trust mistrust authority figures. people defer percieve smarter them, others deeply mistrust anything understand.

i'm curious know 70 countries referencing - list? only, right? originally thought cruise ships would act nice human-scale petri dish examine practices applicable state/country level. only. Okay, listen me. person living Sweden I, others live here, know fact distancing rules place long time. update specifies distance minimum gives municipality responsibility. 

Also said ""The Local Sweden well reputed source within Sweden"" true. Wikipedia page ""COVID-19 pandemic Puerto Rico""
""The number people recovered, tests administered, tests pending provided early stages pandemic available since April 24, 2020. May 4, government representative giving status governor said might able begin providing number recovered near future.""

This might explain recent 100% positivity rate! ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ Could get one makes put mask noses too? I'd settle that. least learned something. Sanofi botched mass-vaccination program philippines dengue fever. turns outcome different dengue-endemic areas compared mass vaccinating travelers europe north america.

The outcome least 600 kids died, causing mass backlash vaccination general. led another 400 deaths due measles.

See problem saying ""it's perfectly safe everyone disagrees anti-science dumb baby rocks brain be"" wrong, people longer trust vaccines kind.

People trusting vaccines good thing means really important things carefully make sweeping statements like ""all vaccines safe"", they're not. Mass vaccination always tradeoff actual disease negative effect vaccine. would need feds step in. That's going happen.

Every single hospital system country ordered instruments, starting Feb. Arizona likely ordered last week. Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary state‚Äôs Department Health Human Services, said state three-month supply protective equipment. shortage reagents, chemicals used run lab tests, become problem, said.

Florida hospital here. three months worth PPE. also excess reagents we're rationing tests. COVID plan requires us test admissions regardless admission reason scrap shortage chemicals means labs take five six days report coronavirus test results, instead quicker turnaround time health officials would like see, Cohen said.

Which makes contract tracing harder employees forced return work without knowing test state needs help federal government well supply chains close gap, Cohen said Thursday afternoon press conference.

Goes narrative huh? feels like years ago Overall good news, still nothing set stone vaccine work long term, still speculation. Also, article mentions believe vaccine prevent severe symptoms, great save lives still pass others vaccinated yet can't vaccinated reasons that's good. also means still spread infection others, sort social distancing need stay still probably. need vaccine blocks infection treats infection already covid-19. may ready til 2022 beyond I'm guessing. Either way personally vaccines rolled next year I'm traveling. figured lqy low til treatments and/or vaccines ready help this.

**Mapping deceased result covid-19 Stockholm County**

Published: 2020-07-03

Up including June 12, 2123 people Stockholm County died result covid-19. Infectious Diseases Stockholm Center Epidemiology Social Medicine mapped affected.

The report first series aimed facilitating region's work covid-19 adverse public health consequences pandemic. reports aim provide quick knowledge bases based public health data generated county pandemic latest knowledge internationally.

\- upcoming investigations provide important knowledge designing efforts reducing health consequences pandemic, says Bj√∂rn Eriksson Director Health Region Stockholm.

The report states covid-19 likely common cause death summarized 2020. people already died year result covid-19 died heart attacks strokes together last year. shown National Board Health's cause death register.

The investigators divided Stockholm County 170 geographical areas, called service areas, average 14,000 people each, see geographical distribution died. turns great variation areas different parts county. also differences areas close individual districts municipalities.

In areas least number deaths, fewer 2.3 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants, areas severely affected ten times deaths. report contains data 170 service areas.

The authors note service areas hit hard affected society whole, special housing elderly (S√ÑBO). remarkable cases many died without special housing affected all.

The report shows slightly men women died covid-19. surprisingly, older people died younger ones.

The vast majority died born Sweden. However, taking account number deaths within group, appears persons born Estonia Finland severely affected relation Swedish-born. largely explained fact people group average older Swedish-born. people born Somalia, Syria, Lebanon Turkey, mortality higher expected given age, gender spread infection area.

The next report due fall expected address aspects socio-economic conditions, household composition occupations household, affect affected covid-19. Yup that's another scary number, number unresolved cases. might get yahoos wear masks. football powerful threat might get put mask. numbers - numbers.  probably fascinating theses matter. Australia performing thousands tests... United States Brazil. That's correct way saying it. countries America. Glad left Florida....oh wait. source back this? unable find one. struggle think simple say would working US? Here, [have obviously correlates initial exposure, plenty people got covid got news. Everyone became cautious plenty people likely mild cases. article written terribly; especially regarding citations. links go claims makes. FDA recently released guidelines vaccines.

Vaccines much harder make think you‚Äôre appreciating. 50% would cause celebration  obtuse highlights difference rest civilized world behaves Donald Trump's government behaves. sure could call us proud red anymore. Tides turning thank god Foreboding? rules changed yet meeting people? Last time read 2 households create extended household. Ontario, higher population 150 new cases per day Nursing homes require targeted protection benefit general lockdown society whole.

This absolutely false misinformation. Swedish report elderly, especially 80, far hit hardest regardless total number deceased country. comparative figures show elderly Sweden, relation population general, affected elderly countries Nordic countries. **The crucial difference total number infected deceased think anyone knows yet, read report China, sooooo......who knows. guy delusional. could kill you! could irreversibly damage heart lungs? simple flu. Vaccine coming save you. Get it.

It's going burn South next weeks over.

South African spent '90s working emergency medical rescue services covering townships around Johannesburg.

Perhaps best keep assumptions yourself. people use America US united states, would wrong.
America US same, England UK Great Britain, kind are. ""I tested positively another sense. tested positively toward negative, right? no, tested perfectly morning. Meaning tested negative. that's way saying it. Positively toward negative."" got called sheep listening experts lol. Still waiting thousand bucks, buddy.

That's lot words disprove said. yes government fucked royal, continues so. maybe coincidence represent 1/3 global casualty rate.

I appreciate medical provider, that's pretty broad statement. actually working patients, thanks. Maybe weird question goes... would need transport huge amount product tiny vials ? would want send kegs stuff around places (hospitals vaccine center) distribute vaccine using approved methods.

They could even ""kits"" every keg send, like transfer vats. see health professionals would need 1 dose per vial medically competent countries... Except situations like Miami close beaches town everyone flocks beaches right outside city limits leads infections due overcrowded beaches. leaders critical thinking skills 6 year olds. Yeah, patient privacy still exists dude. lot numbers crunched arriving reasonable conclusion based detailed statistics. volunteer's case must followed several months see after-effects vaccine themselves, much later future see affects next generation too. detailed opinion found elsewhere similar circumstances reproduced below: (I dont know credit this, copied days ago)

Time infection hospitalizations 2 -3 weeks. time April came around NYC started testing like crazy virus peaked fading nearly month. Compulsory vaccination well established US, going back 19th century smallpox epidemics. 

And proven slippery slope. crises response epidemics pretty well containable, conceptually. Back 19th century, time people refused vaccinated smallpox would face quarantine along infected, theory get vaccinated, would assume infected within scheme public health measures. Solved problem right fuckin' quick.

And even modern times place heavy burdens refuse routine vaccinations - many states can't go school college, generally excluded much society. rather harsh compulsion get vaccinated. resulted broader erosion personal liberties. 56% cases CA make 39% make 74% LA County's County COVID-19 Cases Top 100K Set Record Cases Single number confirmed cases among people ages 18 40 42% past two weeks, Ferrer said

50% immunity would fantastic, modified behavior basically means herd immunity. Maybe mass gatherings 50% immunity easily implemented behavior would lead steady decrease cases. Going start seeing NYC spike protests next week, yesterday, NY went 1k new cases 1st time month. People can't blame next spike restaurants bars time. wonder reddits excuse NYC gets rocked again.

Circling back this, look daily cases graph bottom right John Hopkins site, tells interesting, clear story. protests nominally said really gained steam 5 days Floyd murdered. articles putting May 31 tipping point, coinciding Memorial Day. look graph, 14 days (June 15th) pretty much start new wave we're currently witnessing. 

I'd say thing surmise sign pretty much everyone USA point decided away distancing, regardless political views. Hey, thought: maybe USA slow testing many cases! /s TBH looking President Trump decide whether protect yourself, may fit existence.  Whether wears mask, condoms underwear really influence decisions. 

Science move data. June 8 decided masks necessary. 400k around world already died. Trump neither scientist medical professional, scientists medical professionals got wrong again, death projections masks. MIL healthy 80 quarantined herself. try visit occasionally, keep strict quarantine home too. depressing. keeps saying, life's going kill now. Again, claiming anything. multiple studies results. 

Perhaps lot COVID19 deaths NYC actually COVID19. know cardiologists saying ppl heart attacks strokes disappeared. kills 1,700 ppl day America. reptilians trying turn great nation abyss may subjugate us use us sex slaves harbor eggs. overwhelm numbers that's they're letting virus kill us. contained virus I'd burnt out.

Are implying Italy 40 million cases? irony keeping Economy open save corporations cost human lives pretty glaring IMO, are. I'll let use source prefer determine timeframe infection hospitalizations. say 2 weeks say 3. outlets say hospitalizations peaked April NYC hospitalizations peaked March 30th.

What I'm saying late party one politician ""discovering"" spread air month well known fact. Reports yesterday said healthcare sweden returning normal. So... respect think understand China works. literally case Netherland got faulty n95 masks China Chinese claimed n95 masks despite fact literally imprinted kn95 them, Netherland sent back asked n95 masks, arrived tested case.

Yes would illegal China means nothing. Law China apply citizens way, things like result incredible corruption Chinese society. Everyone lived China longer period time (and expat bubble) would confirm that. actually probably biggest problem current Chinese society. sad. elderly relative left house since lockdown first started, probably vaccine. Thanks Trump federal mismanagement, likely lose year life sitting inside really living. say faster open. is. pipe dream. It‚Äôs time realistic... virus around least 2 years. need focus adapting mandating mask public places nationwide. I‚Äôm attending funeral today rural Missouri grandmother, people 65+ hardly wearing masks... üôÑ Tetanus virus vaccine needs boosted every 10 years. consider : lot churches poor building rent space schools (which works well schools closed weekend anyway)

Correct I'm wrong it, though. movies even released theaters? Always busy spring break summer. question intellect kind people.

Yes, video started lying learned term play well (as overview post). 

it seems like seasonality terms people outside may large impact virus. US south, ""indoor season"" due temperatures outside scorching hot example seeing huge increase cases.

Half hospitalizations transferred different counties Mexico anyway.

Now week later we‚Äôve day day increasing % positive (5-7%) despite huge increases tests (more doubling topping 10,000 tests day) showing 300-500+ positive cases/day.

Community outbreaks hit 21 (county trigger 7 week), yesterday 10. It‚Äôs gotten bad 67% investigations community tracers start day.

Now we‚Äôre state‚Äôs watch list within one week we‚Äôre greater 103/100,000 testing positive day. Monday county several venues shut 

Hospitalizations ICU cases starting rise. 

All took one week. 

At first pattern community outbreaks, looks like restaurants/bars main outbreak sites.

There social distancing well adhered mask rules since April. Community tracers went 30 almost 500. Testing went hundred/day easily handling 10,000/day.  waited several weeks opening different parts economy. everything ‚Äúright‚Äù yet are. still 300 million Americans then? answered question then?  like self inflicted 9/11 every day one other. california texas report multiple times day, tennessee, south carolina, florida report one time.

I‚Äôm assuming Rockland county NY? Let‚Äôs face , it‚Äôs boomer genocide that's gotta million dollar bill said done right? jesus christ basis would ignore wearing mask now, ICUs fill up? Elected officials US anything without assent Vampire Squid? Man that's bad. believe fact new cases materially increasing lately positivity rate continues climb means we've hit type ceiling testing capability grown larger we're currently able track record. 
Unfortunately seems there's nothing left watch what's happen state. Glad live sticks least feel bad damage caused Everything changed since June 27 report published. Look daily cases.

Good hear! Costco Eastern Washington (Spokane) Monday, felt reassuring see every single person inside wearing mask. point, I‚Äôll shop (hurriedly!) place enforcing mask requirement. what‚Äôs time frame this? finish testing start distributing it? states report day update throughout day? Police reform going come rioting taking monuments. started happening ruined entire meaning peaceful protests lot people outside urban liberal bubble gotten frustrated.

Has pandemic closed mind primary care? anyone know homemade cloth masks common countries aside United States? wondering time dynamic is. example, imagine developed nation's like Korea utilize disposable, medical quality masks entire population. assume Zambia may NGO's distributing masks people rural areas would use cloth masks close quarters indoors. states Southern US probably shutdowns coming weeks run hospital capacity. may wide ranging initial ones March though. don‚Äôt think Northern states summer, we‚Äôll see things fall.  point find acceptable people dying something could easily prevent. damaged kidney recover long term. cheap cover real terrifying reason: voter turnout among anti-maskers likely high. want attack base. easier yes. vaccinate four different flu strains every year due family viruses behave. may similar program coronaviruses far know.

I cannot wait vaccine recommend patients.  393,000 people tested, 36,700 confirmed cases. 10,500 confirmed cases coming past 2 weeks. Ok, someone *didn‚Äôt develop antibodies* getting reinfected. Considering still seeing articles everyone seems develop them, still aren‚Äôt sure long last.... seem bit confident answer. Yep, racist anti-science, sure. also pleasantly surprised close friends anti-racist science, unfairly judged they‚Äôd married live.

I invite educate declaring Reddit things cannot done. people still owe money. order pay it, declare bankruptcy. fucks credit seven years good luck buying car house getting credit card.

The hospital still owed money. option write debt taxes. recover full value, offsets loss revenues.

All happens person afford declare bankruptcy. outcomes like hospital bill going collections bank showing repossessing everything own. means minimum 75k infections period 6 weeks given lag time infections. Even flu hospitals would danger filling... yea double standard shocking really, It‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm little stressed taking Reddit. apologize. 6% Cali... now. Interestingly enough, Florida, outside panhandle, lot lower church attendance. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's saying Florida, want head south, go north. wholesome! wonderful, glad loved well. never said anything positive test rates. simply saying Trump tried brag increased testing, never said right wrong. trying brag cases. guy said expanded testing obviously have. apparent % positive tests 7.3% low 4.4%. I'm sick misleading titles knee jerk reactions panic follow. Deaths substantially ever point negative help went hour late every show Rob wanted build suspense. Suspense nobody cared except him. lease signed day last set bills rendered old address need wait end month get ones new address, case neither photo id... Circulating antibodies form lasting immunity. diseases (like Hep B) see others lasting immunity mediated memory B cells. Aw wholesome People confined cars. 1.

3. ""The odds"" mention seem personal perspective. matter time. Young people going partying... ""Be home later mom!"" it‚Äôs great vaccine reduced pneumonia thought biggest concern cytokines point magic evidence got change mind. realized things gotten bad enough something done mitigate it. 

This simply reasonable assessment. extraordinary amount evidence things bad Texas point hospitals health care workers begging Abbot something.

He refused every single attempt.

And tell hospital Florida private conversations governor go public.

Something made change mind. teaching TX long time I've made anecdotal observation many social studies teachers can't get hired unless also coach. Districts looking one person fill roles. Extremely unlikely: single example person antibodies getting reinfected - studied extensively. are. potential organ damage survived terrifying. I‚Äôve got one kidney.  hardly go careful do.  Also going cause antibiotic resistance azithromycin guess don‚Äôt care anymore right? Right. guess point bars ""just people."" think individual bar, hard imagine account thousands new cases. remember thousands bars state, even restaurants -- high risk settings. Cumulatively represent crazy-high population people. Much higher population protesters.

It's likely new cases caused protesters, nearly many business-as-usual service sector. round stupidity virus. Religion, dogmatic adherence wild conspiracy theory. Fun stuff, sure acts like contagion. we're literally breeding ignorance I'd love see proof. thing many people would stolen masks advice given. problem: people stealing hospitals.

Mistakes made, question it, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt correct ourselves. think studied Public Relations Professor Baghdad Bob. hope animals won‚Äôt come flocking hospitals putting healthcare workers risk get virus.

That's weird coz Twitter would learned back Feb

The whole world uses social media, spread uniquely worse US countries. 

What gonna blame nest ? Porn video games ? stock ticker under? Anybody know phase trials in? Didn‚Äôt see mention article I'm done educating people seven months learn basic differences flu COVID-19.  U/leyrue nails it. Vaccines protect degree, main effect generate herd immunity, like universal mask usage. Haha really said that? ‚Äúmanly‚Äù you‚Äôre afraid mask. Venture say Texas probably pretty large population illegals too, likely step foot hospital literally choice fear. Every day let grow without action another 3 days locked fall- tried ""ignore hope"" strategy literally deadly mistake. us masks didnt work Jan-March shortage front line workers. admitted this. 

why anyone trust him? lol (I know. making point asking come peer reviewed evidence, knowing none.) Yeah I've heard central northern counties exception, that's outbreaks either, sort indicating population density mask wearing.

Gatherings family friends indoors far common, far dangerous, ever indeed easier go grumble teenagers outdoor parking lot. Surely problem youth's moral corruption! bet they‚Äôll wait gotta start loading corpses semi truck trailer. 


I‚Äôm half confident US handling right now. next spike least equipment available preparedness.

It's ""hurr durr freedom"", giving government ability regulate one person must themselves. Sure may start good, even great, case like COVID-19, believe second wont small stepping stone something worse population future. Karens Social Media: Bill Gates created COVID-19 spread using 5G!!

I‚Äôm taking pandemic quite seriously, I‚Äôm also taking trash environment seriously since undoubtedly negatively impact life sources including humans. Divers already noticing trash pandemic polluting ocean killing wildlife, impacts us micro plastics end seafood people eat. I‚Äôm taking pandemic seriously I‚Äôm also taking environment seriously. I‚Äôm one short sighted solutions solve one problem create two issues along way. Health care workers:

What health care workers calling specific processes we're seeing? There's lot stuff we've never seen created names I'm hearing hospitals same!

What call sticky blood quite pulmonary embolisms? bullshit. allergic reactions components, like reactions shrimp flowers develop. also autoimmune response called guillian-barre legit terrifying, common actually infected virus we're protecting against. 

The idea going damaged toxin buildup years misinformation basis reality. sick wearing masks everywhere normal release sports none happening. travel work still restrictions annoying. go Canada Europe people act like I‚Äôm diseased I‚Äôm American. wife also home months she‚Äôs aggravated.

Everywhere look great, beautiful country numbers rocketing Moon tremendous ways, folks. things affect person it. someone wants fat making person standing next shop fat get now. Thank explaining this. That‚Äôs terrible policy pandemic. stand corrected. Pretty sure sold cost price tbf way say 67 deaths seem little off. 168 deaths state count full time residents headline deaths. normal ? states report deaths ?

Step 1:   

Use COVID kill enough people improve unemployment.  

Step 2:    

Have Mexico close border build wall keep Americans.   

Step 3:   

Win!    

The problem Trumps plan he‚Äôs killing enough people, he‚Äôs needs start holding rallies ASAP. Vaccine? like 5G mark beast! got laughed multiple times told people reason behavior coronavirus strong, diligent &amp; feel like need take fmla, talk primary. whole lifetime work, maybe get &amp; take month so.

So, future health, work weight. Especially take time off. judging 1 bit. well~ Obviously recognize it. people power/who money recognize it. like said, greed corrupts, people power rich. ""Tax rich"" work rich pieces set make sure things happen. help propaganda saying it'll affect average middle class voter well. brainwash mentality ""I worked hard money, punished?"" that's clearly case/issue situations we're talking about. aren‚Äôt bad presidents, somehow evaded mentioning worst democratic president 20th century, mentioned Bill Clinton presided peace prosperity. Probably still couldn‚Äôt make one sars, it‚Äôs hard believe something complicated family vaccine already post removed? Low quality? judges that? think US opting herd immunity. US strategy whatever Donald Trump's short term benefit. US gets herd immunity unintended benefit. bunch people die process consequence.

The US COVID-19 problem. US much worse problem COVID-19. person listening years makes mistake bad take banish them? Thats bit insane it. ever make mistakes say something stupid?

Nobody perfect. Joe also wear mask, he's uses pull turtleneck type one showed podcast Bill one. agree. live border city, one active cases Mexico, county side border also alarming number cases. 

As understand, completely close border borders cities really dependant one other. many people live MX border city, work USA border city. Also much economy small US towns, depend mexican people going shopping. 

What Mexico close borders USA allow people really need cross border. far know, USA this. allow mexicans cross ""shopping"" work/live there, cross. Cool, need talk fucking antivaxxers it. Honestly, ethical send antivaxxers antimaskers new planet, I'll go. Sign fuck up. think phone got coronavirus website. many pop ups notifications covered whole article similar story. 
Had friend turned completely conspiracy theorist this. Inadvertently found didn‚Äôt unfriend me, blocked seeing posts. found girlfriend telling go look crazy stuff posting, last post could see month old, posting multiple times day. purposely put echo chamber, hear absolutely views. election, assumed pretending stupid order energize base. campaigned him, still idea REALLY stupid. seem possible. Here's Arizona's latest case/death chart, running 7-day averages: Arizona ranked states, terms per capita COVID deaths: Well, Jan 1 2021 UK still operate like EU, EU banned US travel, UK really matter restricting US travelers getting restricted themselves.

Just another consequence global infection shit-hole: countries can't even individually open borders without getting restricted, nothing.

But hey I'm sure leisure services industry restaurant jobs enough keep empire US dollar propped up. problem can't cancel open due policy cancellations phone, mail email. Lol.

Enjoy ruining planet tar sands celebrating leader wearing black face. MLS also tournament Orlando starting week too... deaths 4-week-long lag. still impact lockdown measures, intentionally misinterpreted make wave 1.1 seem bad is. good option sure, I'll look it! avoid going public. lucky enough live three people wear masks, theres really need wear one. Plus, province 3 active infections new ones 8 days. Pretty proud us actually  current US death rate per confirmed cases detecting cases now? cases detected? Sure. neither know rate 10X observed rate. could accurate, 1/10, anywhere between. also held relatively stable even we've increased testing, may go much goes herd immunity really anyone's guess.

You want think could 700K FL alone without protection, number seems astronomical abhorrent. mean happen though, think preposterous developed Western country. virus care bounds sensibility world work. research finding source, cure/management.

""was told cancel funding research coronavirus infections emerge humans."" prevent 1 death, everyting power that?

Get back give driving car, rest entire life. Fuck ""new normal"" hospital staff first get sick though? I'd imagine reservoir staff already contracted recovered virus immune it. Everyone headed whales vagina unless something dramatic changes overnight. Amarillo? Shee-it. Panhandle's brutalized. Midland/Odessa getting there. Cool, that's huge portion, there's abother huge portion ""mild"" symptoms like congestion. people really need worry coronavirus. *Those rookie numbers, gotta bump numbers up!* ""lost control"" pandemic way distracted toddler ""loses control"" balloon- never control first place idiots. Puerto Rico that. went far allowing certain range last license plate number certain days week- like 2 weeks helped. Sundays closed STILL curfew 10pm-5am.

Still hard get K/N95 masks canada. you, I'd call back good news.

&amp;#x200B;

""Mama, killed mask""   I‚Äôm much aware. statement exactly point.

Robert Redfield knack transparent honest, right? Biggest numbers ever, nobody seen anything like it, tremendous, covfefe. really isn‚Äôt lockdown though. Heck one US outside Bay Area, Northeast, Michigan really one. closing schools, places worship half businesses, people still about. Restrictions bars restaurants imo rolling back slightly. mitotic spindle inhibition hope right. teacher, I'm scared. Thank God mother one. still thinks mask take away freedoms...... trump talking slowing testing?  ???

I really understand point post. There's huge difference Strep Throat killing 2k/yr CDC stats, vs. Coronavirus killing 130k+ USA right now. ""small"" words, going get worse passing day USA fails implement protocols (social distancing, masks, etc). cost nanny depends many hours works. daycare spot paying 50-60 hours week childcare, even use all, multiplied number children have.

But parents work home, stagger schedules work around naps, may get 20-25 hours week babysitting, example. 

With older kids need constant supervision hours homework help, hours/cost even lower. share nanny another family neighborhood, cost also lower.

At end day, lot empathy people getting sick dying covid people complain look alternative childcare solutions status quo, less convenient. Schools shut fun, they're shut save lives. [Maybe face shield, like Today: expect 1000 new cases tomorrow

Normally, heart disease leading cause death United States. early months pandemic, some¬†hospital departments nearly devoid¬†of heart, cancer, stroke patients populated before.

Looking analysis, 50 patients day ‚Äúdied excess deaths heart disease, New York City,‚Äù said John Puskas, chairman cardiovascular surgery Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital Manhattan. ‚ÄúFrankly, would explain patients went.‚Äù  Lol wish could upvote once! Proven wrong? words fact now? researchers quote thesis?

Just cause said something doesnt make correct dummy still wrong.

You can't get longer lasting immunity vaccine infection itself. immunity last 6 months max, best case scenario 6 month immunity vaccine unless keep getting shots every months 

You gotta think realize these, hard, try sometimes Texas hospitalizations continuing surge 6/4? think media hysterical? challenge find article stating deaths 1k month. reporting that? Today lowest day since March. Crickets. idiots took seriously begin defenses worn away leaders telling right thing suddenly. Yeah, great point that's really discussed enough. lot backlash masks comes CDC hammering point early days masks 100% ineffective actively recommending people wear masks despite evidence contrary already available time.

Had come truth day one, lot less low-IQ conspiracy types refusing wear masks giving reason ""first said wear them, say wear them, knows believe!"" live Georgia follow local news stations facebook, gets brought constantly comment sections rubes decrying masks.

I get prevent rush masks PPE limited time important get hands healthcare professionals. gaslighting public way go it.

They could transparent start said masks effective given PPE shortage low incidence COVID point, people refrain buying make homemade masks meantime. could implemented emergency order temporarily banning sale masks general public,

Instead, chose go coming deliberately giving public false information!

Their first move gate broadcast misinformation walk back ‚Äì undermine credibility erode public's trust guidelines set institutions day one. minds cannot critically think - gave us guidelines complete opposite ultimately turned case, who's say everything else they're saying completely wrong?

What incredibly stupid short-sighted unforced error CDC. made major miscalculation we're still feeling effects. known climate especially, trust authorities all-time low move would major aftershock. dumb anti-mask crowd is, CDC also played major hand contributing current state affairs.

And another pathologist 100 years going say, ‚ÄòHey, pathologists didn‚Äôt know said cause death COVID-19.

* Pseudo-Science level: Strong
* Factual Reporting: Mixed

""Overall, rate Christian Broadcasting Network right leaning promoter conspiracy theories via Pat Robertson 700 Club. CBN News however, mostly reports accurate news sometimes align science."" wait two weeks! Yeah that's thing. Even new stay home orders, there's way really enforce like be, majority people. (CNN)A global study found strong evidence new form coronavirus spread Europe US. new mutation makes virus likely infect people seem make sicker earlier variations virus, international team researchers reported Thursday.

""It dominant form infecting people,"" Erica Ollmann Saphire La Jolla Institute Immunology Coronavirus Immunotherapy Consortium, worked study, told CNN.
""This virus.""
The study, published journal Cell, builds earlier work team released preprint server earlier year. Shared information genetic sequences indicated certain mutant version virus taking over.
Now team checked genetic sequences, also run experiments involving people, animals cells lab dishes show mutated version common infectious versions.
""We know new virus fitter. look first glance worse,"" Saphire said.

*snip

Three nine times infectious

The new version seems multiply faster upper respiratory tract -- nose, sinuses throat -- would explain passes around easily, researchers said.
But tests 1,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients Britain showed infected new version fare worse caught original strain. still likely end higher death rate, we'd hit like 350k pass theirs. That‚Äôs great all, hospital systems collapsing across country might problem worth everything possible prevent don‚Äôt KNOW, presumably testing people obvious severe symptoms Might dumb question, area 14 day quarantine people visiting state, 14 days person arrives mean arrive quarantine 14 days. think after, seen both. US. 3 cases? lol  Worldometers shows US 57,207 new cases today, shattering previous record 51,097 cases, also yesterday Missouri inadequate testing state. ~ 1k deaths (all official counts low) ~ 150k infections (estimate low prevelance significant error band) around ""should"" be.

Even 22k figure, includes many recent cases without fatalities match, obviously wrong vs. 1000 deaths. That's 4.5%, way high. testing anywhere good enough record 150k/day. call freakish events jumping gun. deaths related question people's immune systems overload fighting virus (which still answered now), especially consider USA's transmission attributed young people (this impact death statistics depending happens). point ok. It‚Äôs standard way immune systems work. Technically, catch anything immune systems suppressed. virus mutates enough, change point antibodies fit receptors virus right. However, bodies don‚Äôt start scratch - takes tweaking. Partial immunity better none. People tend think either ‚Äúimmune‚Äù 100% vulnerable, doesn‚Äôt work like that. People CR5 mutation makes one resistant HIV injected virus still contract HIV still technically labeled ‚Äúimmune‚Äù scientists, reason. 100% immunity, that‚Äôs okay. ‚Äúcatch‚Äù coronavirus twice, slim odds, partial immunity already - aren‚Äôt going get sick first time body doesn‚Äôt build antibodies scratch.

The thing ‚Äúwe still don‚Äôt know catch again‚Äù inducing fear reason people. Oh god need pictures Business Dog STAT! RemindMe! 3 weeks may need sedated since he's lung life support machine. machine breathing depending settings adjust, feel like drowning either. 

Still sad heartbreaking go this. Thanks FLA. it‚Äôs always something guys. ""It'll disappear"" -Merica  read Oxford thread yesterday? pretty confident would Dr. Fauci Dr. Gottlieb sound confident early 2021.  Woow, Americans dumb fuck lost shit declared outbreak hit like 30ish cases. live, 30 cases would practically mean over. wish took seriously. fired fined, law? administrative leave another way say paid vacation hate pick you, wow,[ changed tune lot three Kudos, actually. guy needs locked away. lockdown joke tbh. Measures rolled slowly, many exceptions 0 enforcement. 

Everybody acting like persecuted ""lockdown"" idea strict countries. lot friends various parts Europe even leave house without stopped questioned. Huge fines issued people caught violating quarantine. 

We baby version quarantine. much larger number people dying permanently damaged SARS-Cov-2 virus. month lowest deaths since March today. Here's article Texas stating hospitalizations continue surge. seriously laughable. 

As someone raised super religious: they're often antiscience. 

So yeah, Dr. Fauci probably better source. Honestly? half government telling people lie real hoax bad. 


Then half saying bad serious they're still opening stores restaurants gyms back makes people think ""well obviously bad we're opening back up"" 



Mix god dam Facebook making everyone think they're special ""know"" masks work 5G, get US current. 



Oh piss poor education system probably help either Well case numbers started rise since 10th June look 7 day moving average. since 23rd 7 day moving average climbed higher levels saw April/May. I'd say we'll probably start see deaths rise within next 2 3 weeks.

Secondly alot young people catching virus ofcourse high risk older people. guess deaths still rise within next 2/3 weeks levels seen April. Hopefully it'll modest rise deaths. work restaurant state hit hard compared others (though also seeing big increase now). re-opened indoor dining may 12th half capacity we're still serving excess 1000 guests day. continue stay home pay bills, I'm horrified lax people whole situation upset get us bare minimum keep little bit safer. like everyone thinks since things reopening, virus vanished. BLM protests? stupid, virus. Didn‚Äôt mobile was. isn't. PM put hospital changed course there. know though? observed change behavior taking word it? Yes India's testing per capita literally around 5% US. 7th June daily cases reached lowest level since March, much higher testing capacity. death rate US going explode back month next month, virus growing much faster testing capacity advances treatments are.

Thing is, Fauci ""media hysterics"", though got things wrong - CBN is. comment teaches americans empathy whatsoever. instead feeling sorry affected, americans choose attack specific groups individuals. love get people think even ok idea go parties right now. keep seeing random reddit posts people (mostly US) talk going parties, large group gatherings go see family like big deal, react badly someone points there's pandemic going on. country even leaving house go see frowned upon since we're making huge effortby staying home socially distancing get control selfish idiot ruin it. think understand. I'm asssuming young English first language.

How know heart attacks COVID - COVID pandemic? 

That's happens people get COVID, heart attacks die? Others die diabetes get COVID. New York 911 calls heart attacks tripled. Many trying go hospital, died covid got Actually rules apply read article. cheif put administrative leave investigating. That's we're talking about, contradiction actually understand vaccines work. trigger immune reaction similar superior high virus load patient, resulting theoretically longer term immunity. 

If asymptomatic people due lower viral load develop immunity last long wont effective (if want herd immunity) one able trigger durable immune response, like proper vaccine. Yeah know, oopa loompa president. oompa loompas (Brazil, example) issues. head needed polishing, 

I called mom US 57,000.  100,000 per day prediction seems like right around corner.

Nicely done.  4th July upon us able much better.  150,000 per day?  Challenge accepted!

I respect Dr. Gottlieb lot. high chance January says, think exaggerated bit one way other. Norway, shares border Sweden, outbreak good control month even now. 1. island 2. country extremely high burden infection long almost impossible patrol border. Norway perhaps best argument TTI is. 

Denmark Finland also share borders Sweden (DK maritime border, see Sweden form DK's shores far) also outbreaks control. Denmark today 500 active cases, Finland even lower (although tbf *its* new infections Sweden... typically traced contained least far). Right, thats said. US Brazil make least half number. Add Indian subcontinent rest Latin America get majority cases worldwide. forced wear masks.

Nah wearing masks anyways. forced back lockdown... agree you. used proud say I‚Äôm American. recent, I‚Äôm ashamed American. went admired joke. hate country. Every day goes by, wish Canadian. feel way. go weeks without social contact. can't deal anymore. want someone. wish someone actually cared life. never felt lonely feel like feeling go around. also never felt suicidal right now.

I honestly waiting student loans come get supplies need kill myself. must symptoms close contact someone virus even related virus declare different cause death. cases cannot either test find got cannot count. course there‚Äôs way would lead undercounting. counting like conspiracies. You‚Äôre really trying tell 3 every one thousand people contract Covid age 65 end hospital it? 

I know statistics data people passing around, honestly can‚Äôt believe fully. 

3 1000 people 65 go hospital? 

1/1000 people currently get hospitalized? 

These numbers aren‚Äôt right. large part without much research looks like they‚Äôre measuring people Covid ended hospital population country. 

Not population who‚Äôs tested positive. say. Freedom ain't great pandemic, would've thunk? Educated Alabama never mentioned sentence. Good job Florida nah, I'll staying fourth girlfriend, celebrating living Canada. 750,000 canadians got fuck country.

I still wake occasion standing middle room, ready spring action. I‚Äôd heartbeat. That's stuff nightmares. U A. U A. U A. Here's whole bunch results saying protests havent source talking increase protests that's LAPD increased rates, probably wearing masks anything supporters, meanwhile, lambasted LAPD individual officers weeks wearing masks protests, said put risk. Multiple lawsuits LAPD‚Äôs protest response cite lack masks officers crowding arrested protesters packed buses pandemic examples department‚Äôs unjust response.

Also noticed end; place held protesters 12 hours still handcuffed inside concrete bunkers access bathrooms water.

And protesters **still** didnt see increase rates infection. True, outliers. Yeah, feel really bad service industry workers asthma other, even major conditions, still work make ends meet. I'm pretty healthy still left house maybe dozen times since pandemic started. Y'all I'm tired ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pretty commonly joke rest world America. America operates differently every country terms state, local, federal government. literally comparison. Disney closed later have, outrageously so. think they‚Äôll keep ‚Äúpostponing‚Äù opening, like hitting snooze button. best numbers. Everyone says so. Beautiful numbers! Completely. mother got sick early March attending event involved thousands people February, couldn‚Äôt get test didn‚Äôt fever past 101.-something.  Thank goodness. I've test twice prerequisites procedures, giant Q-tip actually massages brain.  Z scores bit understand.

I tallied total number deaths time period year, rounding nearest thousand ignored excess deaths baseline years. pretty much number people died year last 4 years. 

From - take - every year, something kill people rate , time period, regardless whether bad flu year (2018), coronavirus year (2020) average year (2017 &amp; 2019). 

The big difference see 2019/2020 - comparatively - deaths winter big surge April. almost flu season winter, hit sudden short 4-5 week period instead extended usual 4-5 months. Parent blatantly whines child reasoning adult. judgement rushed. 

Damn, amount hissy fit comments got comment, idea many insecure people breed there. again, considering topic reddit news human behaviour published every day, suprised. *Gas, gas, gas, somebody step gas.* Ask anyone, they'll tell you. taken sides original comment. So, it? Deal traffic folks eat, or, safe out? Dude, realize South Korea, Taiwan Europe figured out. Use *your* brain, Lmao. That‚Äôs happens reopen early! preventable Could possibilities.. could sadly took vulnerable first due lockdown easing making way general population healthy less likely severely affected. 56,920 new cases today according worldometers, shattering previous record 51,097 (which also yesterday)

Edit - 57,236 today I'm calling now, good quarter US population refuse take kind conspiracy theory reason. hope see surge antivaxxers locked long nothing imagine quite people watched way many hack doctor videos youtube. stop ""vocal minority"" BS? clear huge segment population making masks political. think mask mandate coming NOW? covid blood disease, increases clotting factor massively. read anything sub - even headlines - last three months?  I'm glad wrong even Texas thing. People days think opinions undeniable facts, refuse admit they're wrong, even proven wrong 1000 confirmed sources information. happens *before* mix th political BS running rampant country. Small percentages people kinds normally mild infections die every year. think Strep kills around 2000 Americans annually.

MRSA, etc.

It‚Äôs sad course, it‚Äôs something policy based around. Wolf haters shambles!! shut whore mouth. 
Exponential growth also friend. example: investing. Actually, there's pandemic lmao could easily claim job requirements go religion. Remember police supposed protect life citizens? Senate Majority Leader... ppl call bullshit must bad day? üôÑ   reasonable repercussions it

It surprise anything either. Everyone knew coming day news headlines first turned breaching lockdown.

Sigh. ""A little risky."" people contracting Covid coming weekend hospital go get sick. 
 
For example Houston hospitals good full coming people late, 'near death'. number going keep growing. 
But take word it, listen head doctor saying himself: want vaccine, slaughter them. religious science deniers keep saying 'sinners given quarter' pull reverse card slaughter all. Let God sort out. Jahwe. Ganesh. Allah. Kahlii care. Forbes become Tumbler? Hong Kong Flu iirc only! LOL Actually, no. That's battery. Sometimes you‚Äôre butt, sometimes you‚Äôre plug. even get vaccine i‚Äôm still gonna rock mask somewhat cautious cases start dropping significantly. Yeah, very, bad. Jefferson co. basically doubled confirmed cases single day. That's exactly China well Chinese New Year. happened get detected time big national holiday is. Selective Service (AKA draft) still exists. old enough, may even remember register turned 18. completely relevant.

The precedent 100% matters. think 1970s old outdated terms precedence, really understand things work. like yesterday terms jurisprudence.


There also significant precedence mandating vaccinations quarantines purposes public safety. I'm sure gut telling wrong ""hur dur freedom."" would suggest actually researching history precedence here. making decision though? Shouldn‚Äôt people color protesting hundreds years protests? Especially given people color far vulnerable coronavirus? heard substantial pushback protests black leaders black friends. hearing ‚Äúwear masks‚Äù ‚Äúsocially distance best can‚Äù. 

There always ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù motivations. ultimately half country NEVER like protest matter justified is. 

There critical mass support haven‚Äôt seen civil rights generations. 

The fact black brown communities see police violence institutionalized racism issue big enough protest even risk spreading virulent disease communities?

That say something. likely think second shutdown much U.S, rate things going? rise Coronavirus cases testing massive good, far bigger better country,"" Trump tweeted late Thursday night. ""This great news, even better news death, death rate, DOWN. Also, younger people, get better much easier faster!""!&lt; 1. think lot reported cases reinfection.
2. Nobody knows. CCP objectively bad US' corona response even worse noticed. said stupid people inevitably die refused vaccines. Never put forth theory anything, never said would die significant numbers. Mexico needs take page Canada‚Äôs book shut ‚ÄòEr bud ... samples tested yesterday, people lined get tested yesterday. likely samples days ago. Well then, America quickly descend chaos. one file taxes anymore they‚Äôre bust intubated. Economy goes deeper shitter.

Fan ^for ^lack ^of ^a ^better ^word lol, differing opinions aside, u reel dum Pretty sure end right answer. I'm guessing deaths wave cause start showing August/September. meantime deniers use low death rate younger crowd catching ammunition reinforce ""its totally overblown"" narrative. even read posts make point trolling?

1. Total number samples taken week 26 first link provided you. number A.

2. Total number positive cases per region week 26 find second link part says Veckostatistik Region access click link choice browser. find every region number positive cases week 26 (so numbers B1 B21), sum get nation wide total positive cases, aka number B.

3. divide B convert percentage.

I hope addition division easy enough math. Well, makes sense. People want congregate July 4th would perfectly fine coming together protest. choose outside mask shoved packed bar mask know one poses greater risk. think many people reasonable (though perhaps fully informed) reservations come board decent number others taken vaccine turned fine. Thankfully hypothetical pants head insane reality. It‚Äôs like disease that‚Äôs 0.5% deadly 1 billion people get it. vaccine 2.5 million die instead 5 million. absolutely amazing researchers developed vaccine would saved lives single group people history time. Thanks. know that. Germany updates day reports come in. worried happening? I'm wondering, basically side effects could bad? Merica Freedom  try strategy remember, whatever infection rate less whatever nyc has. see NYC start go (even counter measures), herd immunity strategy doomed failure. that's BS. Europeans visit Atlanta Detroit. Shit look America treats citizens. Cops brutalize Americans everyday, access social nets health care controversial topic, etc. long line testing site guarantee 100% tests become positive eventually, lines breeding ground virus? good, they‚Äôll think won‚Äôt need it‚Äôll leave doses people right thing.

Well yeah US indictment state called leaders. see rest world opening back means time open back up, right? ""shut down"" ""did"" told us we're America ready roll!!

Like disconnected ignorant reality solution. half-assed every part quarantine, every corner America.

But large understand entire purpose coming meant daily lives changed *forever*. mean we'll get vaccine eventually lot things go back way eventually lives fundamentally changed doltiest dolts (like less 40% America) willing accept can't even see insistence opening economy right ultimately going continue ruin it.

Sounds like good way become millionaire. want believe is, Americans become crazy lately longer know think. absolutely reports death rates anymore? true.

Fuck manager. know, Houston definitely doctor: ""We're heading pure hell"" hospitals transferring patients amid COVID rise: 'We're running ICU beds' patients sent facilities 50 miles away.

And rare events, happening across state. dare italians ignore constitution mean half assed lockdown measures work EVERYONE lock time...I'm shocked, shocked say!!!!!!! Oops. accidentally tell truth again? bad... Sorry, video (there even segment John Oliver it) revising. actually governor said. Saying quiet part loud. 

Nothing excuses telling us truth. might help short term get behavior want, long term erodes trust. causes people act like children.

This goes DK great results, didn‚Äôt lock wear masks. 24 Hour Fitness like cancelled years back. I'm sure changed varies location, cancel person could guilt try talk it. Marble racing. Glorious Marble Racing. issue havent slowed virus really arent even trying anymore. 

Also kids mild asymptomatic cases shown long term lung damage xrays months later early hit states. developing country, take offence comparison. harumph! guess enough people dumb/ignorant enough demand still there. players symptoms random tests? 19 different teams positives (so assume 19 different cities?) . seems like case everywhere. looking hospital tests everyone coming minor surgery/procedures symptoms 2/100 come back positive, several hospitals looked at. 

Seems like never end till everyone exposed one holding hope vaccine ready anytime soon. Yep. would‚Äôve loved see expressions faces customs told piss off. ultimate Karen/Ken reactions. 

*Do know am?!? want speak manager!!* absolutely right thing . 
Staying home prevented hospitals overloaded. encourage continue shelter home. Better witness tsunami hospital admissions caught desperately it. least roommates, many don‚Äôt even pet keep company. Can‚Äôt believe border open all, regardless.

I'm big fan ""Stella"" wanna check Wains mid '00s work. He's part decent sized writing room Childrens Hospital/Medical Police, Stella closely creativity. Plus there‚Äôs minimal profit vaccine. Well obviously suppose 'forever'. average response (not best), trended like europe NY/NJ.

Back March yelling people take shit seriously lockdown hard drive virus towards eradication -- shut economy hard 2 months order dribble pain year. told ""impossible"".

Here fucking are.

Germans perfect they're good model could chosen do. Vaccines going given tens thousands people clinical trials general public receives them. extensively tested safety. choice.

Here germany argue lot mask thing. mandatory ever people get close (shops etc.), outdoors.

We discuss lot time lockdown adequate, masks? came conclusion masks simple, cheap effective.

But least aware fact ""the end corona"" might actually lot earlier US. price. list statistic unfortunately (good point) addressed conclusions effective all. 


[Here one studies reference say single cloth layer masks masks 3x effective single layer cloth masks. one decided test several different homemade mask materials measure ability filter particles maintain pressure speak masks ability filter creating ""seal"" around users mouth. surgical masks best due greatest ""fit factor"" measured seal tandem pressure drop measured across cloth layer.

It‚Äôs already production. know already late. numbers nuts. need get new virus rates well enough serious contact tracing. delaying inevitable harming economy more. can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre downvoted. situation US horrendous, situation Mexico actually worse. Rather read it, people would rather downvote goes ‚ÄúUSA worst‚Äù narrative.

Trump really incompetent crisis (as usual), AMLO Bolsonaro might worse.

The world isn‚Äôt US, everyone. person replying made point likely correlation due fact protesters starting adapt behavior getting ""the memo social distancing judging last protest."" *if* seeing spike protests, driven compliance saw protests week ago. guy troll spreading misinformation trying rile people sub. report block him. I've lost count many stories I've seen people saying vaccine works, vaccines? would put odds students even campus fall? Wait what? think STD? addressable policy. can't see difference, someone draw picture. still gracies combat sports irrelevant GOAT discussion. aggravates US situation is, unlike Spain Italy, people go doctor time walk around spreading virus far longer.  
 
Also finally go see doctor often late. Dr. Joseph Varon says people coming 'near death' Houston, Texas, example: That's great analysis skills, figuring July, clearly GS's financial advice brilliant.

Also, pretty sure, point, someone's wearing mask, they're deliberately nothing short active enforcement change that. mean, counting honor system prevent social economic collapse, might want check people honorable first so. started raising around 2.5 weeks ago. Seriously, loss, much anyway. Yeah one. Thanks! Jailing COVIDiots turns prisons death camps. can't stop them. people get flu vaccine example.

This false. virus flu vaccine (unless nasal spray) dead cannot infect you.

Some people develop right antibodies flu vaccine still contract flu receiving it.

Some people reaction flu vaccine raises immune system small bit minor side effects like low grade fever runny nose. flu.

You spreading anti-vaxxer Canceling planet fitness sub time I‚Äôve ever Karen too. aware headline talking share positive tests, yes? many tests would increase absolute number positives, decrease share positives, enough resources also test people less probable infected.

A high share tests bad news. means there's still huge amount infected people see. God isn‚Äôt weak, he‚Äôs lazy. wants come house, ain‚Äôt going yours! biggest fear that, facial recognition everywhere, masks ILLEGAL wear public (and actually, many places, masks illegal wear public, least masks covered entire face‚Äîlike couldn‚Äôt go random animal Halloween mask).

That‚Äôs need afraid of. Masks mandated there‚Äôs money lose masks made *illegal* there‚Äôs money lose advertisers profit police can‚Äôt track habits location easily.

If masks ok now, always ok. Period. People shared endorsed IS-related terror material deserved attention punishment got. Likewise seek worsen pandemic ought tried similar crimes. Nope. wont take Bill gates made it. trust computer guy designing vaccine, lmao. clip privacy end right there. anyone reading this, fucking use fireworks use hand sanitizer chose cause problem administrators Gettysburg welcome center

Then proceeds rant public social media guy troll spreading misinformation trying rile people sub. report block him. creativity have? Sadly, digital tools probably net contributor spreading consider crazy ideas.‚Äù

Saying could help implicit blame. quote explicit blame. see teams able compete couple cases leads whole position group going quarantine. lol no, people paranoid. Reddit, Inc. compromising comments maybe 5g antennas making us crazy Yes, Nordic nations successfully suppressed virus protected populations. continue keep infection burden low via Test, Trace, Isolate. Trump actively thwarted states trying lock down. ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ local schools complaining kids missed many things robbed them. 

Umm dead gonna miss whole life It‚Äôs non profit. Stupid people inject blacktar heroin. thinking too. feels inadequate honour sacrifice. log computer name? Well is, was, closer real discussion. answer much sounded like paid attention. prove causation? No, hypothesis data (and supplemental behavioral studies) appear support hypothesis.

Are suggesting study demonstrating opposite? counter argument feel happening is. 

And dont suppose me, hold degree sciences, work data living. Based experience information available.. would say reasonable timeline readily-available COVID-19 vaccine is? dangerous speech doubt highly standardized, fully studied process proven years successful safe, minor wrong-turn stories.

This given all. immense pressure forces play make things work. I'm saying people working half-assing deliberately cutting corners pressure, conscious unconscious tradeoffs judgements made might ordinarily made. already get vaccine quickly possible without compromising safety. others tradeoffs made privy to? project rushed always requires little extra scrutiny. original op-Ed linked first paragraph‚Äî truly horrifying. Thank remember jokes. actually ""won"" laugh. felt sick stomach wondered horrors hid administration would unleash. know. think distrustful-of-government group exists...? group huge, getting bigger time. fact, still trustful government they've thoroughly fumbled response pandemic, either got serious learning do, problems.

Also, seems may surprised learn people right people left equally likely conspiracy minded. I‚Äôm American. He‚Äôs right. wouldn‚Äôt let Australians America behaving we‚Äôre doing. Lolllllll Man, get heat, sounds like actually read Happy posted. bodies basically say...we evidence Covid spread way. chlorine kill it. know.

How becomes ""pools safe"" I'm sure. Optimistic reading maybe?

That said...I'm still using community pool. There's usually anyone else easy keep distance. agree, chlorine 'likely' kill pathogens I'm comfortable risk. still risk. referring jet picture article Since general death rates back normal 4 months first case that‚Äôs really important. People die covid-19 would die something else corona virus hadn‚Äôt existed. higher death rate per capita moment means people immune. 

The US managed ruin economy hard lockdown totally missed minimize spreading social distancing. That‚Äôs impressively incompetent. mention people live one state work another. seems impossible implement enforce. fucking CDC *ITSELF* reports likely 10x many infections official cases.

We 500k cases every day. news. Every single time fucking news headline posts ""XYZ number confirmed cases"" context reaches top subreddit everyone poitns feel vindicated. 

No one cares actual data. ‚ÄúBernie Bro‚Äôs 4 Trump‚Äù

Just scroll u find data set sort state city. patient heart attack starts smoking cigarette. It‚Äôs disappointing, it‚Äôs life live (briefly) reason we're reading article rich enough. Yes, need support healthcare workers best time come... remember watching famous cook following online post vlog saying going back visit uncle back countryside. saw title like uhhhhhhh wtf? thought countryside proper protections place watched video trepidation. Turns out, village entrances blocked off, main entrance roadblock looked two village elders armbands on, told cook stop car, called uncle meet entrance. made sure stayed apart uncle talked uncle gave produce farm left. 

I mean literally countryside village dirt road taking precautions seriously. Nobody cared put mashk. ""it's free country""

""sir even country anymore"" True fair mask compliance NY/NJ exceptionally high late March extent dead anywhere near became That's behavioural - people always ignore rules meet up. similar Ireland, businesses, pubs, restaurants, schools, gyms, cinemas, etc shutdown, that's pretty hard lockdown. remember African dudes carrying coffin pretty easy mistake make.

IDK playing safe crazy everybody, can't play safe????!!?? Hahahahahahahaha

(gasp)

BA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

The lockdown inevitable. boiling frog public opinion same.

Exponential growth + long potential incubation time = lagging indicator city. 

By letting things get bad act, ENSURE things get worse. 

Gov. Abbott's timing nothing consistent - day late dollar short (in case 14 days late).

By time looks like last best chance avoid shutdown, already week late stop coming. 

If Abbott capable pulling head ass (which apparently non-newtonian space somehow contained within Trump's ass), would learned paying attention last FIVE GODDAMN MONTHS. 

But Abbott cool listen math nerds, instead brought hell earth upon people Texas (who STILL bloviating social media masks block freedom entering bodies....) Still price higher! insane. smart. get people careful social distance, ones already so. agree completely uncontrolled outbreak open. However, necessarily speak whether kids significant spreaders disease. like ability spread it, evidence suggests spread far lower rates adults do. ‚ÄúGo back shithole‚Äù - Italy mean, there‚Äôs reason country‚Äôs name United States. union highly autonomous political units. 

Ditto United Kingdom formed union four kingdoms/countries (England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland).  [See Still price higher! insane. protests aided spread covid? stance since day one

Quarantine vulnerable let shit play out. Yeah I'm thinking they're getting full season in... read second half article?

But Dr Varon convinced real difference Maths+.
""No-one needs die coronavirus more,"" said.
""This cure coronavirus stop build-up problems lead needing ventilator happens, chances survival 20%.

Math+ includes cortisone steroid, vitamins anti-coagulants try curb key challenges caused virus - blood clotting inflammation.
""We've months now,' Dr Varon said, ""it's working charm"".
He much believes hospital's 100% success rate nearly three months Math+. ... fact dumb fuck son Litteraly people literally ... seriously alot people ...

Yes, dumb fuck. someone case literallies. 'alot' word.   surprised ends one day 50% worldwide cases deaths.

Not India keeps going. India 7x larger Brazil, poorer, markedly stupider (more 1/4 Indians can't even read!). fast exponential growth, doubling 20 days, hospital infrastructure weak. surprised India ends cases deaths, simply large population. state pretty good testing available. enough drive centers definitely none nearby. I‚Äôm bit nervous actually go inside wait. yeah, think I‚Äôm going to. Right carers live carehomes. family lives outside work. Food, medicine supplies transported homes. 

70% people asymptomatic get infected. Unless gov't implements widespread testing, virus transmit make carers fault. Three months lag? doesn‚Äôt take three months transmit, incubate, test case. takes 3 days two weeks incubate, 2-4 days get test results, another day reporting. US reporting 400 deaths/1M pop, Mexico reporting 225, check facts people. smoking thing really best comparison get saying. Yikes news article... anything keep Coronavirus news going suppose. Previous lockdown didn‚Äôt. wasted state federal governments preparing reopen. agree too. enforced pandemic control people taking headline running it. People, doctors governments going break protocol, American people gladly cast first stone. intent government current strength federal government shameful affront founding fathers. 

Another point: federal government actually still weak, intended be, trump would far less impactful. Lmao it‚Äôs hypothetical...good grief, guy. actually sounds pretty low. maybe I'm used numbers rest moronic states. compare countries? take years. Assume IFR .5% medical system surge nationwide could handle 50,000 admission / day. given evidence NYC surge areas reasonable. means set target 10,000 deaths / day straining breaking USA medical system. means 2m new infections (not confirmed total new infections). 80% 328m 182m. rate 3 mo hit hard doable numbers. 

Arguably seems seem targeting accidentally creeping it. mean we're mostly pandemic. Everything back 'normality'. Main difference masks required, apart seems back pre pandemic. UK transition period rules regulations still apply. Haha doesn‚Äôt spread water...buuuut covid usually transmitted air people come breathe. aren‚Äôt fish! üò¢ u/gwhat-you-say president! Dirty.hahaha. ""I DEMAND SEE PRESIDENT GUY"" look link above, flight records show indeed flown there. ...then PPE. asshole owner probably didn‚Äôt provide enough of. 

Also completely ignored second part comment, specifically said everyone spread asshole. wish government would admit arent capable handling well request help countries handled better. asking masks shit actual leadership help think must multiple initiatives use preforms. one mind done concert researchers ORNL Sandia NL. 

It seems shown idea viable option executed correctly, partisan cash-grab ARS seems insinuate. Department Energy‚Äôs Manufacturing Demonstration Facility Oak Ridge National Laboratory worked Coca-Cola Consolidated determine whether soda bottle preforms, small plastic tubes heated blown bottle shape hold carbonated beverages, used test tubes COVID-19 kits. kits include swab, saline solution plastic tube enclose swab transport.

Pretty interesting stuff. *Americans* think rules apply them


FTFY sound like chicken all. Weird, almost like think rules don‚Äôt apply them. uh, listed risk factors complications covid?.. young people infecting old people though. Old people start infect old people, too. mention also middle age group. recently saw statistic Florida example number infected 75+ years old also rising. sharp rise among younger people, numbers also increasing. can't find statistic anymore, one comparing age group 0-44 45+ age group Florida. towards end cases among younger people started increase early May. number 45+ years group started increase later end May extremely far among younger crowd. Nevertheless also clear upward trend them, too. 

Personally expect happen everywhere number young infected going roof. think different generations living bubbles contact other. think people forget young people die low rate this, actually account fraction cases. Hows coal anyway? needed happen expansion education free college people communities could make transfer careers exist demand high possibly remain communities create thriving businesses reliant dying industry. Instead, got cat butthole lip service shit help rural communities. rural communities did. got fukt shitty trade deals across board. ¬£10m per boat company owned mate Dom's never produced boats launch coinciding hurricane season i'm sure go well Like cancer bad car accident, lot heads, happens people. obesity suddenly caused 10% increase death rate one year would comparable. 

Obesity chronic societal health issue. 
Covid-19 acute issue hope slow spread vaccine deployed.
War might compare well either, it‚Äôs fairly common way frame mortality counts. So, antibodies, second time form.

That would seem imply people severe forms infected twice. 

So theory correct, would expect active people develop severe forms. Yet, 50% us deaths occurred nursing homes - least mobile population.

I‚Äôm overly confident, I‚Äôm trying piece together available data. He‚Äôll take credit ‚Äúwarp speed‚Äù push brings market faster. PRC locked Wuhan took measures throughout country, order keep majority country virs-free. instituted NPI provinces hit virus picked people travellers Hubei arrival provinces.

Their plan quite well thought out. principal aim keep much country virus free resources intervene Hubei.

No one prevented US thing, except know who. keep mind adverse effects vaccines don‚Äôt always happen week later. adverse long term inflammatory effect hepatitis B vaccine. series shots took period year, didn‚Äôt really start damage last shot solid 12 months first shot. large factor testing capacity indeed. \~48k tests June 26, versus \~52k tests today. tested more, would lot cases.

You still see virus spreading fast looking [positivity skyrocketing right now. New York peak 41% positivity rate tests, Florida currently 19.7%. spanish rusty, basically ""thoughts prayers""? Thanks! He's warning US enough. tone tempered sure, I'm pretty sure that's can't speak forcefully Trump fired, losing position would give far less influence now. Thanks! See get. thought beginning CDC saying masks worth it, sounded fishy.

Them coming ""we said want run PPE medical workers need"" made feel relief instinct unreasonable, anger mistrust lied to.

The truth is, think would lied too. saw happened toilet paper certain medications carelessly suggested helpful. appalling think might like happened masks. decision may put slightly danger, made trying keep doctors nurses safe, long run keeps public large safer.

And that's experts' jobs. keep me, personally, safe. keep public safe. me, none lesson failings agencies organizations much lesson dangers political extremism, selfishness, panicked mobs. still believe many experts want jobs, discover use knowledge solve problems. money politics jerking around putting lose/lose scenarios, like whether lie masks preserve supply can't trusted look interests. great news! need mass production handed every drug store, pharmacy, street corner!!!!

Can't say I've run across use 'jab' before. 'jab' informal way saying someone received injection something? completely awesome news! virus mutating necessarily mean thwart vaccination immunity. things use dna rna mutate. Coronavirus actually pretty bad mutating compared RNA viruses.

The mutation Fauci referring (1) yet fully characterizied - researchers still confirming hypothesis allows virus replicate easily (2) currently thought affect efficacy vaccine candidates. I'll admit pro choice sounds better pro children dead fucking measles. I‚Äôve heard stories people yelling nurses demanding see loved ones ICU simultaneously wearing mask. hope.

They don‚Äôt pretty even expensive, buy like them.

Drink shit ton water (always seems mellow bit), maybe add ice fresh lemon. Seems stupid changed mood.

If someone can‚Äôt idle hands, find random stuff tinker even slightest purpose. (Put new handles old hammer heads, sweep walk, replace beat up/ broken shoe laces shoes still like)

Infection rates low across state came across ‚Äúchicken little‚Äù large chunk population. combined politicization virus (his Lt.

That doesn‚Äôt absolve responsibility, agree don‚Äôt think Abbott ever disbelieved serious problem.

And fact wager knows it‚Äôs already late, next two weeks infections hospitalizations already locked matter anyone July 4th. pre-selling inevitable shutdown things like restaurants schools cities. Another waste time, wont understand virus another decade.

But something learned last couple years trying better ally job tell people color protest add din criticism protesting however may complicate lives more. 

My hometown, Minneapolis rate infection among protestors ~1-1.4% statewide infection 3.6-3.7%. picture painted media, vast majority protestors NYC elsewhere wearing masks using hand sanitizer taking common sense measures protect others. appears much harder catch virus outdoors. 

That much attention paid protests manufacturing plants food processing facilities bars restaurants indoor dining (which far virulent vectors) leads believe engaging hypotheticals don‚Äôt match science evidence piling protests. 

Even good faith criticisms questions become part pressure protestors stop. Especially face evidence already contrary. **Bottom line is, stay safe 4th**

*Stay home fifth* ... grossly ignorant generalization, especially considering inverse that's indeed true. Traditionally, vaccines take years years go R&amp;D production. anyone would rush vaccine low death rate effects low percentage population beyond me!!! I'm way vaccines faith medical professionals. However, haste makes waste I'm hurry imbue something created panic. inside there's turning back.

Learn something new today, thanks!!! called meditation try sometime Yeah, stupid people already come take vaccine comes reported cases far bad things really are

On positive side, US currently reporting lowest number daily Covid deaths since March. Deaths steadily falling past month downward trend concern. research rushed, clinical trials be. far I'm aware, there's way determine long-term effects without waiting seeing happens. want vaccine, also want test subject it. They‚Äôre seriously still 6 feet apart line Covid test. Come Texas.. won‚Äôt need then. You‚Äôll already gotten rona ;) italian twitter account named ""young iranians"" reporting number two hemispheres globe. Good points however pretty much silver lining.

Two general classroom settings remember well, tiny room packed 30 students, lecture hall, freezing recirculated air, never fewer 350 students. 

Then settings, labs, especially tech, again, cold recycled air, generally spaced though. art students might safest comes covid, know stereotype, they're usually spaced out, windows open, go outside. 

And massive crowds classes change, shuffling past trying get door. aren‚Äôt gonna see shelter places states aren‚Äôt control. aren‚Äôt necessary. Even health officials agree. problem state can't get tested prescription doctor- state regulating number daily tests, giving priority symptomatic patients only. 
He lives flat 3BHK- garage! Maintaining 6' hence problem. able contain virus.

Wasn't goal flatten curve? assumed everyone going get it, wanted spread health care systems overburdened.

Why shifting 'weapons mass destruction' 'free people iraq'? really opening Disney week. governor get clue Disney get clue?? Even fake testing site lines get people house feel oppressed.  research x-rays they've taking asymptomatic people's lungs.

Outside that, works immunocompromised patients literally kill.

Even boss (illegally) fired this, would rather look another job possibly weight killing people cared head. Extensive research extensive research cant speed ageing process they? Agree you. Totally rushed. share similar concerns. However, aren‚Äôt reinventing wheel. use methods development practices new vaccine used previous vaccines shown incredibly safe. chance could bad side effects, personally 100% getting KNOW coronavirus does....

Unfortunately, since mass distributed people develop rare serious complications. blown proportion people hesitant get it.... like vaccines. Exactly. 

""Everyone wear mask. Medical-grade N95 masks reserved medical staff current ID, members public wear non-medical mask bandanna.""

He could educated American public cloth masks used 100 years ago. could modeled behavior himself. would much better. Early Dr. Fauci said, ""If looks like overreacting, probably right thing."" Obviously, weigh current situation, afford overreact know wouldn't. ""There good statistics"" goes ways. 2 4 week delay... Positivity 15%, apparently huge jump want due backlog (or havent said yet). lol mean testing anyone forgets situation first place.

Wish ""done math"" sooner.

**""There reason anyone walk around mask on""**

\-Dr. Anthony Fauci, Mar 2020 Oxford.

All talk wank. Germany really confuses me.

Because lots traffic Italy France Spain Berlin February March. 

And testing wasnt well done. remember March/April hardly anybody Berlin Facebook group tested.

And whole neighbourhoods pretty much ignored lockdown rules.

Plus big anti-lockdown demos streets mask.

It seems, overall, like *should* hit badly Covid.

But outbreaks anything, low numbers.

It's strange. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* sweeping incorrect statement.

This statement Lilly made. referring comment skipping mayor DC said since relevant conversation. Also skipping statements Fauci made since they're irrelevant well. sufficiently answered question /u/ctr1999? top health experts recommend social distancing mask.

No, said anything actually answers question. guy never lived 08 recession.

I‚Äôm sure De Santis whip 1000 new beds practically overnight. can‚Äôt bring sufficient experienced healthcare workers site administer care 1000 beds.

The vast majority Australia entirely uninhabited. Overall population density means absolutely nothing. allowed 400,000 passengers China first weeks fake shutdown travel ^(what lot people think staff get sick. covid knock half staff hospital quarantine combined exponential growth number patients make adequate care next impossible.) see comment ü§£ Thank continue ""breaking records"" quite time. insane, I‚Äôm NJ.

NVM read article. bad. I'll believe vaccine safe effective see elicits immune response make people DRASTICALLY ILL challenged disease, like SARS candidates animal studies. laughing? This. Even bystander/child could figure locking staying locked occurred. look Italy, Spain, UK, NYC ask question - happens Florida, virus act different locations? DeSantis end guy prioritizied politicial ambition businesses opening health safety citizens - nothing cautionary tale. destu rate US .63%, that's week  look up... tomorrow familiar percentages.

I said ""basically"" percentages create confusion example gave (""0.02%"" vs ""0.2 per thousand""). expecting new daily case records expand testing? way control that? Lol people reddit horrified Chinese Italian response covid. countries basically eradicated it, America it‚Äôs even beginning peak.

What‚Äôs going take people take seriously? Comparing days week help weekly ebb flow reporting. testing pretty bad too? likely much higher mistaken? agree, entirely.  need reduce transmission 100%. need confident R0 1.  But, confident get much reduction, enough. Less, enough. Imperfect compliance, imperfect materials, imperfect enforcement, reduce benefit significantly.

So far, several state governors tried ""just enough"". still problem. ""Just enough"", enough.   much stake, sense taking chances. carefully calculated requirement get ""just enough"", work.

We need perfect masks. need perfect social distancing. need every single person wear masks. need enough things, cumulative effect enough.

(And, BTW, brand new N95 mask, fit-tested, trained user, least 95% effective.  re-used N95 mask, fit-tested, untrained user, leakage around edges, unlikely effective.) Bipolar Unless protest, social distancing must. look data, little infections connected protests. Idaho No.1. Lol. Who's tired winning??!!!!! realize contradicting right? cant vaccine dont get immunity infection first place .

What think vaccine do? top link Google one potentially reliable studies. Everything else front page Google search results showed max 45-50%, several claims lower. Haha question is: die 1 day getting infected? It‚Äôs weird isn‚Äôt it? ‚ÄúAlternative facts‚Äù news sources taken hold lot country. 

Even lower scale still lowers ability spread. America, fuck yeah. happened claim close-knit families communities? Seems like parents would always family friends watch kids prior pandemic. Downgrading HIV makes virus less potent? Oh absolutely, two perfectly comparable, Australian hard comprehend scale cases US.

(Also unrelated fun fact: even though Australia small population, incredibly urbanised: 50% country lives 3 cities). use combination zinc waited long patient far gone. many articles success statements made doctors using it. Unfortunately, allowed posted CV subs, talked MSM paid doctors positive manner. Idk, seems like awful longer live days feeling people going flocking get flu vaccines. combination mask wearing people generally feeling uncomfortable leaving house, agree you. really think populations overlap much think tbh. hospitals running capacity dude.

R0 rates states looked rising lockdown increases lockdown continuation. NYC 2/3 cases people self-isolating.

Lockdowns answer unless question ""how completely destroy nation?"" tested 10 million people Beijing crush outbreak ended hundred people. That's point. Covid deaths sandbagged pneumonia deaths.

The deaths actually attributed covid left column. complex math problem. grades extracurriculars somehow better terms dealing economic inequality? fact standardized tests best ways measure performance students despite racial economic inequalities everyone takes standardized test. Oh, private sector counterparts, mainly independent labs such, undergoing consolidations last couple years. Singaporean? Even then, believe ""team"" like talking PUBG discord server?

We‚Äôre human all, hang buddy anything possible, historically, vaccines usually cause long term issues. short term side effects usually pretty mild like little fever, headache, sore injection site. Posting social media incident, Rep. Keller also called requirements wear face masks ""unconstituional"" suggested Americans ""losing rights"" amid coronavirus pandemic. 

These people fucking idiots. unconstitutional stores require people wear pants?  gas stations require people wear shoes? Sorry, bullshit spilling everywhere. Today NC DHHS reports new high 2099 cases.

Yah share frustration Fauci ascribe current popularity ""he makes smirky face Trump talks"" that's apparently important fucking thing.

He's supposed US expert infectious disease here's worst global pandemic 100 years done exactly? takes 2-3 weeks average see results. 
These two articles explain antibodies fading mean immunity lost. Lots fear going around lost antibodies, body memory cells allow future responses similar pathogen faster effective. Lots fear going around fading antibodies, body's immune response. Lmao great. Thanks sharing. Loss victory! People want social distance. want children able play children socialize used to.

I heard neighbors day saying discussion outside uber-liberal Maryland!

We need realize people sick tired locked homes ultra-majority people get CoVid mild symptoms symptoms, speaking someone mild symptoms parents died it.

People looking even liberal areas families 'just another flu' ultra-majority again: unfortunately is!

It unlucky like old like parents (69, almost 70 mother) virus bad. case probably worse father immuno-compromised virus could mutate become worse challenge, passing mother him.

People going support staying locked unless one family members dies disease facts above. stop doubling testing capacity, reporting changes or...? 5- Actually common cold coronavirus vaccine considered immunity last longer year, shelved now.

They start dirt napping en masse soon enough. Heck, looked. Maybe FL deaths now? grew OK TX. Neither states positive people getting birth control abortions. result, lots people babies. Half young women high school pregnant. 

Additionally, bad education system, women going unprotected sex instead using condoms (or birth control) go college. Studies show women college education track hold babies less them.

I'm triggered think ""lockdown vaccine"" possible scenario majority people, left house since March except walks/grocery trips can't imagine living life next 1-2 years.

Wearing mask completely unnecessary contagious viruses exist. Research terrain theory. No, haven‚Äôt. point close Florida, let burn like forest fire. Yeah... Dan Patrick really showed one. He's wrong. cost parking lot major arenas higher that. know needs hear this, Andrew Cuomo New Yorkers done good job. Today, New York 1,033 cases (according Worldometer), would equivalent Italy 3,099 cases -- Italy many new cases today, country would probably go back lockdown. And, top cases, New York world's second highest per capita death toll -- highest New Jersey took lead days ago.

One world's highest per capita death tolls 1,000 cases random Thursday.

Not good. worth celebrating. Even then. father terminal heart disease even sister trying convince face reality needed... never did. never written, bills never paid like said would, home grew sold (the story complicated agency keeping simple).

I spend quite time refuting outdated knowledge.

So actual official data published, better. really, death rate declining now. I'm pretty sure main lab testing getting another test machine August. 12k/day right backlogged week. labs AZ manage 2k collectively, we're pretty much capped August. Imagine stupid would believe I'm case, please publish data conclusions full people read decide opinion correct. people know underlying condition best masks buy Amazon? see better reviews others really different?

Florida man, stupid put mask keep 6‚Äô away others single handedly destroys entire economy. trying downplay risks need wear masks, I'll take current deaths per day late March deaths day week. basically certain undercounting death problems lessened versus early crisis. like people realizing can't stop spread.

And articles China showing doctors nurses faces torn mask days end. price masks area? Shithole country. 3d chess. Mexico paying it. jokes write themselves. ""saw"" 100+ cases mean undetected cases, community spread since October; that's also wrong assumption. ridiculous. What's ridiculous accepting published values without question, regardless strict lockdown measures were, censoring ""purely political"" posts comment is, shutting discourse discussing pandemic. toxic anti-intellectual. Florida Arizona pray kind turn-around NY-NJ achieved. took number WAY down.... let early.

It‚Äôs 2020 America - success low bar, rarely cleared. HBO online place know of. first two months world outbreak many saying situation desperate Iran, much wondering lethal strain there. remember John Campbell saying this. they're going hold Lockdowns last possible moment hospitals become full start triaging patients letting elderly die gurneys hallway. Unfortunately, that's way politicians get public backing lockdown. It'll state state basis, region region huge states like Cali Tx. 2 weeks  speculating 2nd cases much worse, maybe even fatal. We'll wait see. Either way, Table 1 irrefutably wrong. states median control group 18yrs older HCQ group, although also puts median 25% IQR go figure.

False. Rinkeby, hand, relatively deaths special housing, hand considerably society large. Mortality, including special housing, amounts 20.4 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants, excluding special housing, figure still almost high, 19.8 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants. similar trend also seen Husby. 

In regions nursing homes small proportion mortality. another factor play trying UK, Spain, Italy, Ireland locked hard. 

Closing barn door horse bolted never closing barn door all. specifically mentioning nations lockdowns occurred relatively late epidemic. example Ireland locked March 24, time already 1,329 confirmed cases 7 deaths.

Put simply, actual ""common denominator"" prevalence virus society. higher prevalence, higher number deaths, inside outside nursing homes.

The difference Ireland's lockdown resulted spread virus slowed almost stop, Sweden allowed spread continue. Thus Ireland less total cases far less deaths Sweden. Ireland less deaths total Sweden even exclude nursing homes. people wearing masks sad look at. pictures hurt deep, instance federal land, definitely answered question agree you. remove certain name since listed political lol gets approved certain date doesnt mean first wave suddenly doesnt exist counts something different. still literally first wave people get thing second wave people getting. Requiring enforcing China dropped ball, kicked fence. think 120,000 dead dictate policy.

Confirmation Bias

Dunning Krueger effect Absolutely. friends say ""We're going get anyway, what's point trying avoid it?"" response that, assuming that's true, much better get covid July 3 March 3 increased knowledge. surely even better get October 3 July 3. I'm AZ, got tested yesterday simple throat swab. slight tickle Especially wearing mask Years ago went gym made almost impossible cancel membership. requested mail account deleted changed card account prepaid gift card $5 it.  Well Trump seems found way Mexico build wall make pay it. one globing it. It‚Äôll reminder touch face non gloves hand. never touch shit hand. üòÖüòÇ Lol fuck you, Bill Thank you, Doctor. friend confused. link posted Pfizer trial vaccine candidate article talking owned Oxford university partnership AstraZeneca. Phase 3 wtf, feel you. I‚Äôm still salty NC went phase 2 May. meaningful mask mandate might ok, even (like states) mandate unenforceable rely businesses trespass people don‚Äôt comply. Crappy. That's saying. Lock month two get control. Instead going drag next year more, going back forth opening closing, killing hundreds thousands more. Nope, clean outbox time time. 

And disparaging comments account person think pushing propaganda for. everyone disagrees fake. I'm sorry, make sense me. mean, first all, kids spread germs like crazy. Everyone know this. young ones run around snot dripping noses. can't contain that.

 bigger point: child old enough understand risks covid-19, dangerous irresponsible send child public school. six year old infects six year old breaking social distancing protocol, who's blame that?  

 child *is* old enough understand risks covid-19, traumatizing fear sending public school. Would like locked public building limited autonomy six hours day? Imagine trauma child would experience brought covid home school infected family member dies it? experts bring up? make argument online school good kids?

 hope take comments directed personally. really appreciate posting summarizing article. putting two cent venting frustration ""experts"". now, current spike seems worse first, schools universities sending plans opening summer. Human cells take DNA plasmids several available techniques including electroporation. Inovio using similar approach well.

The problem safety issue well making device safely, efficiently, effectively allow cells take introduced plasmid DNA. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs sold Walmart know?

Yep, backend exponential growth chart wide open real measures teeth introduced Bill Gates point basically world expert getting vaccines people stopping spread disease. mean, that's they're interviewing it. miss Tide Pods biggest youngin‚Äô issue. include MCAT this? Depends are. Youd expect places experiencing high rate infection would later increase health care load. fully expect right, many hospitals least yet experience high load. Putting aside complex factors like transfers, I'd find normal loaded hospitals virus spreading quickly unloaded hospitals not. 

For example, read yesterday hat LA county little 24 total icu beds available purpose. also read hospitals prepared furloughed staff experiencing load issues. Clarification: Collin County Judge Chris Hill √§r det en meters avst√•nd som g√§ller mellan s√§llskapen ‚Äì ist√§llet f√∂r det tidigare ‚Äùen arml√§ngds avst√•nd‚Äù. 

Just made clear defined measurment 1 meter instead ""an arms length"".

Still wanna double wrong? Texas ""response"" basically 2 month head start virus, squandered, texas given credit nothing low numbers.

They definitely getting praised while, low numbers, anything actually doing. Seems like UK&amp;you saving world, like James Bond movie. ‚ÄúThere going dead bodies piling streets front hospitals. That‚Äôs good recipe civil unrest societal collapse people Texas lot guns know live.‚Äù

The governor Sardinia calling tourists allowed in, ""even subject quarantine"".

Perhaps lost translation reads want quarantine federal(?) government Italy made leave. Want see real Corona virus response effort make rich cannot things normally do. Thanks. I‚Äôm freaking know? worried whatsoever. Worried two parent live with. late 60‚Äôs everything stay away virus good news deaths trending since second week April started opening up. less. spike protein receptor binding domain human immune systems naturally targeting nuke virus antibodies. Human immune systems thing SARS's spike protein. makes sense too. spike protein surface, what's getting feed back antigens, spike getting rest virus cell replicate. Stop virus able invade cell lifecycle over. macrophages whatever go around clean useless clumps virus covered antibodies.

So nearly leading covid-19 vaccine candidates, except maybe Sinovac Biotech who's got inactivated virus, feeding human immune system whole lot spike protein pieces it. Though mRNA seems, crudely described, tricking human cells make single copy spike ""messenger RNA"". immune system reacts produces lot antibodies. real SARS-CoV-2 comes around, attack neutralize they've trained attack spike. get whole pile virus proteins right place get immune system respond right? seems tricky part.

In end, vaccine's tricking immune system thinking there's virus attack best way make lot antibodies science desires. next attack real one hopefully soundly defeated. 

This perfect description. theory want whole spike protein, piece it, get best effect. theory whole spike protein produced terribly ineffective immune response. Papers flew Jan/Feb/March timeframe used terminology thicker could understand. *""Oh fuck""* shithole country now? force liberal cities cancel mask policy? think gets partial credit effort here. national leadership certainly let us down, number state leaders well, American people still responsible, two reasons:

1) elected leadership. democracy, people responsible actions leaders select.

2) Festival Morons across much country, unwillingness wear masks gathering large groups COVID-19 parties... list goes on. may due people following leaders, refer back point 1. CDC said properly maintained levels chlorine deactivate virus. herd immunity then. 

\*cry\* welcome good news appreciate post, mondaymoderate wrong. Shit still fucked up. governor Sardinia grovelling, though, trying get Italy let stay. Good Italy SARS vaccine abandoned. MERS vaccine gone anywhere years. sure going here. 

You can't speed vaccine trials - matter fast develop candidate. There's bare minimum time needed ensure efficacy safety general population. minimum time **years**, months. Covid19 vaccine LONG time, ever. Ignore anyone tells otherwise. US hospitals get money cases? coz sometimes may count may make false claims, confronted they'll say tests inaccurate. lack national keep non-essential services closed low enough virus cases enough contact tracing safely reopen contain virus. STILL adequate contact tracing (but given number cases right now, contact tracing pointless). Plane back CO though, doubt would stay UK without flight Sure, doubt people eager travel covid raging USA.


Good job people thought covid hoax, believed Trump said would gone easter, refuse wear masks. They‚Äôll learn god intervenes tells stay home. even then, churches would ignore god need money. appreciate work, know parents think technical jargon going help understand. additional downside say ""There scientific study said.....blah blah blah"" lose too. people like need leadership lead wear them. ""oppose anything government tells do"" people, I'm afraid we've lost them. see way win over, need start herd immunity get vaccine. Probably around 0.2 0.3% based NYC total deaths random antibody tests estimate fraction infected population. that‚Äôs great video Agreed hard happen federal government is, well, Trump gaggle idiots, combined individual state governments. it‚Äôs free all. could fly long route small private jet? thought big airplanes specifically designed long flights capable routes? Ahh smart. Become shitty country. Don‚Äôt worry immigrants. Aaahh, there, there, there!

And inferiority shines on. Chinese tourism nightmarish league own, also young. make things better fact numerous ways made things worse.

That's huge understatement :-)  let get straight: angry replaced source another source makes point Dutch, said provide Dutch source?

I'm following makes anything written less accurate. Maybe like he's saying reacting sturm drang. I‚Äôm talking building new facilities + trying incorporate new gmp supplier facilities product license. 

It would obviously much quicker bring online new facility already existing supplier product contact parts. It‚Äôs entirely different beast build new production facility, new supplier facilities, new product line. 

I‚Äôm saying can‚Äôt sped up, I‚Äôm saying within 6-12 months far outside norm it‚Äôs absolutely amazing. Lol, getting rejected border crossing exactly happens. professional looking Jet. Me, psychological scientist: Wait damn minute. jet can‚Äôt cross Atlantic, let alone fly CO Italy Setting records good old-fashioned American excellence! USA! USA! USA! Apparently drive thru Well...of course right. acquired immunity fades 2-3 years, going take least long know. long interval needs elapse damage called permanent. guess wish questions asked louder, publicly. is, wish uncertainty issues advertised vigorously...it would help avoid false sense security.

I hear people say confident recover infected, mind getting with. seems stupid, light can't know yet. Scientists media asking questions might undermine false confidence. Fines work rich people too, scale properly. means linearly, since live paycheck paycheck anyway. One thing I've learned getting older, people money mean smart. Tis indeed, afford chartered jet, I'm sure yacht question probably got work. manage retail location requiring masks (not decision). guess maybe 20% customers wear masks. baffling thing people come wearing mask take get inside store. Happens far often. capacity limited contact customers, got it. economic downturn outward facing economy. can‚Äôt sell nobody buying. least didn‚Äôt contribute much particular problem others.

Maybe would better served lockdown. hard say, true matter chooses do, get better results factors controlled for. 

Maybe Americans wouldn‚Äôt treat government suspicion didn‚Äôt treat us like children. governor, mandatory masks announced, said ‚Äúwe knew would good idea long time didn‚Äôt want say anything didn‚Äôt want much false security.‚Äù didn‚Äôt tell us something could protect us didn‚Äôt trust us truth. telling us truth manipulate us builds bad rapport. could go also conflicts interest kinds problems give people good reason trust told. Plus aren‚Äôt taught filter info sources either school system broke.

Plus got politicized people mostly fall two extreme camps people thinking this. arbitrary. Sweden far right party roots neo-nazi movement pro-lockdown.

But wouldn‚Äôt disparage American people much. comply lockdowns pretty much extent Germany example.  safer though. Small private craft much statistically likely crash huge commercial passenger planes. guess bigger thus redundancy built engines needed. one prop screwed stops working whereas 4 jet engines still run 2.

Well it‚Äôs like people Florida don‚Äôt know lives whose fault state‚Äôs response is. 

Oh kidding Florida find way fix learn anything. thing is, pharmaceutical companies nothing gain bad vaccine lot undocumented side effects.

They'd instantly lose good name, credibility, billions dollars (and big pharmas dont like lose money). Speaking Floridian, protests, beaches open months--albeit restrictions--and saw nowhere near kinds spikes we're seeing now. anyone look data honestly believe argue COVID spreads easily outdoors beyond me.

American government: `this compute`  Chill.

Once NBA gets Florida decrease testing thousand people every day probably (and using available tests). ""Free Information"" group missed aspect controlling data abundance misinformation produce.

The solution seems abundant/aggressive error checking implemented news networks hopefully automated within next years social networks. Wait till vacinee people refuse get it

Many come around anti-vaxxer friends become larger proportion deaths, remaining take notice. Strange everyone around world spending much money vaccine development, then. almost TTI temporary solution win time world achieve herd immunity vaccination. international scientific consensus mention would thus way slow vaccine. 

Is another way get herd immunity infection vaccination, controlled form infection? No. he'd right that. agree ways slow virus down, vaccination-induced herd immunity easily sustainable way. vaccination is/was long way recording video, see problem what's said reading way much biased glasses. Canada it. honestly understand talking about. Since health customers owners store risk, using mask violate constitutional rights. Gonna Dirac Delta function soon. forgot happened right virus started something pissed HongKong sub. showed basically puppet controlled China did. called Adderall. I'll take bet. International conglomerate company AstraZeneca, headquartered UK Sweden existing less everywhere behind particular vaccine. He's playing chess rest us playing checker. World Population: 7.594 billion people. 

Covid-19 Infections: 11 million.

11/7595 = 0.0014485 = 0.1448% Oh hey! finally July! We've entered make break point trials. compare US states countries IFR 1%, 0.4% 0.26%? I‚Äôm obviously aware isn‚Äôt exact number wondering one numbers proven accurate far. Thank you. GOP sumdowning. madness. Mine did, much enough taken dialysis. happen.  Great news!!! Needed positivity I‚Äôm pretty sure texas already red testing hasn‚Äôt enough catch cases. that‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs already late every day waits shut worsen it. Think natural disaster like hurricane. It‚Äôs force nature. doesn‚Äôt give fuck politics economy refuse learn science even though it‚Äôs already told what‚Äôs gonna happen... isnt gonna pretty. 

Well least Texas probably won‚Äôt hold crown long. Hell might even now. Florida really working overtime become worst epicenter. help bring people take serious started slacking. Unfortunately though pretty vocal ignorant contingent gets even dug emphatic wearing masks distancing gets called for.

There especially high numbers people rural areas population also older, obese, poorer fewer healthcare resources. thing starts really taking hold rural communities absolutely overwhelm them...and lot people still give shit. read piece obviously propaganda. police responsible destroying black owned businesses, burning 7-11, smashing windows? $500 million damages state Minnesota fault riot police? Yes, peaceful protestors permits, stood corner signs, issue group people. also many people shutting streets highways creating general mayhem. probably wearing masks. literally said ""every single RTC found *that provide protective benefit,*"" though.  border patrol warehouses filled confiscated cartel drugs might think otherwise Thank you. misunderstanding thank clearing me. play Trump repeating loop waiting line talking directed people slow testing Granted however number 25% correct corresponds 25% reduction cases daily (I think will) would take situation AZ little bit. Even less yesterday saw CDC saying mutated strain dangerous much likely spread. First country far. lot ""elderly"" still working. top Presidential candidates 70s.

This make feel subreddit legitimate way, especially new sitewide rules. I've always felt pushed edge basically protest votes people disillusioned thought voting would express that. I've gotta believe significant minority Trump votes came people think votes would result trump victory.  got rid everything reddit even feel chopping block sooner later. I'm much happier without out. Real friends real life way better. Oh ok. Good data point. Man imagine Obama still charge whole debacle. Things would look different. I'm expert, believe subset population can't trusted. again, trust lot people. 

Take photo illustrates problem. 4 people photo wearing masks. 3 people wearing properly, one not. bad statistics, call 25%. 

If 25% people attended gatherings, sitting standing one spot, wear masks, wore improperly, would major spike.

Go music festival protest/riot, spread same. Wrong total deaths cases significative indicator actual situation, right? Fuckin' good. 

Finally country sense reprimand petulant Americans. I'm young fear death CV that's 1 bad things happen. growing number recovered people experiencing lung damage (could permanent), blood clotting disorders, brain fog, chronic fatigue, kidney problems, heart problems, etc. 

One longest term friends never took seriously, caught April, beat 4 days bragged, month later constant dizzy spells got lung xray. Ground glass signature plain day never got pneumonia breathing problems. went ""you guys way overblowing thing"" ""you guys better stay F away thing"". renew think worth votes. counting votes. See happens three weeks. situation scares I‚Äôm wondering possibly seemingly 5 years many people need organ transplants causing many die waiting lists true. run debt 2,600 sqft homes Ford F-150s, cry government don‚Äôt enough savings get disruption government‚Äôs fault. quote article makes clear Sardinia wishes could (foolishly) bend rules precious tourism governor, Christian Solinas, spoke matter: ""The region Sardinia responsibility happened. Immediately, collaboration airport management company, **we set work - initiating urgent talks government, Ministry Prefect - find solution would allow American passengers stay Sardinia**, even submitting quarantine,"" said Sardinian president....**""The singular restrictive interpretation rules Government, contrary ability guarantee health security, case inflicted serious damage international tourism** credibility island, sense hospitality. hope next hours efforts resolve matter,"" concluded governor.

That sounds like clear ""no would much rather rich international traveler dollars keep community safe! learned, swear!"" Correction: rich people USA......it got name here. Affluenza! Lol course protests help, they're one many potential sources spreading virus. overall lack administration response far damaging. countries lying numbers. hard tell worse much American here, tough watch Canadian friends family border starting return normalcy, even weirder knowing can't go visit long time Well makes sense. Oh wait doesnt. *laughs Nelson Muntz* cancelled last year moving somewhere didn‚Äôt planet fitness easily accessible us - cancel anytime clause agreement. Well, decided charge us following 3 months cancellation couldn‚Äôt find record us system first place went back location signed at... 10/10 would never sign ever (even though loved hydrobeds) lie down, stagger. Lockdowns, especially enforced ones strict, high compliance rates. gone uncomfortable (I would uncomfortable too, would crazy risky me).

I understand pressure imagine almost bad one go go.

There's pressure attend wife's family gatherings, I've held pretty firm, compromised allowing mom grandmother come outdoor-only picnics front yard every week (and parents first time six months tomorrow).

Best luck neither catch it, hopefully work something two risks like taken future. NC, contacted potential exposure last Tuesday, left message doc night, Thursday put order get tested, went done. trying various testing sites health department, contact doc get blown well? know work much luck health department terms timely results, even despite fact test results supposed expidited (first responders). system inconsistent broke people suffering it. work software may well used vaccine production testing. There‚Äôs way it‚Äôs getting rushed. Many labs already vaccines. testing takes time, vaccine creation LOL monopoly board already filled hotels billionaires want life back want keep home office. actually live job dreading going back office 100% time. attempt scare away voters. tried shit Wisconsin beginning virus work well them. continue like deaths hostpitalizations go looooooong time. Could historical footage day tomorrow, Arizona keeps putting numbers like been. blunt still can‚Äôt take seriously - major deference given critical care physicians anesthesiologists gets critical care bed. It‚Äôs small choice you‚Äôre deciding gets round clock intensive care tube. 

We pour census see improving keeps going shit. literally play god re-tier patients throughout day. absolutely authority yank someone vents give someone far greater need. 

While going can‚Äôt handle normal patient population. People get scared stay away. end dying home serious adverse events. 

Way many Americans still treating shit like game. 

I know get it‚Äôs suddenly loved ones sick needing help. fucking hate it. Zero perspective empathy. possible lower, according studies. Well duh! People bars habit sharing drinks! course shutting bars keeping shut vaccine would smart thing do!

Better yet: Make bars serve people outdoors since evidence air conditioning recirculating air causing issues. think safe say battle stop Corona spreading over. Americans chosen let run course. Someone else posted looks like Disney Florida playing game chicken. Disney wants State tell shut Florida wants Disney shut voluntarily. Florida want political heat, Disney wants fire/furlough bunch people say hands tied.

While evidence happening take appropriate grain salt, surprised true. business ignoring order deserves go under. Fuck them. live SoCal. bars reopened, I'll say 1 5 bars area opened completely without enacting social distancing standards. Also, people getting way way close outside. Yes lower outside, mean impossible sitting 1 ft away beach goers. point shit common sense. People need baby sit like little children country. cancer treatment died within week developing symptoms. completely plausible develop fast condition. parrot statistics without considering situation hand, obnoxious disrespectful. right here. amount calories intake order get obesity first place could ever burn amount exercise. Even Michael Phelps eat much.

Obesity visible side effect compulsive eating. I've sedentary fuck quarantine weight changed all, I'm emotional eater. eat I'm actually hungry. much eat goes depending activity level, keeps weight stable.

People obese need address relationship food. exercise definitely good you, going cure dysfunctional relationship. Riiiggghhhtttt protestors reason bunch right wing idiots still think ""just flu"". 


Totally actual President United States who's saying beginning.... always people skeptical vaccines. sad reality can't afford pay price. Thank you. Yeah, gave pop saying needed subscribe something like that. That's great, Coronavirus much contagious worse flu.  Yes, fast track it. People dying, today, COVID. Harm reduction requires speed. many deaths ok? 100k? 200k? million? Yes ADE.

So far Oxford vaccine shows sign causing ADE Yes. Yes are. racist police brutal use force tactics first place, see people pissed enough retaliate. LEO, sure hope realized good ol boys club coming end. Well compare US one worst responses (Sweden, country Trump mocked earlier). aware US well. Might well open everything else time. think person busier Dr Varon PR person. probably 5-6 media profile I‚Äôve read him. don‚Äôt see time treat patients much time spends talking reporters. Planet fitness reason need go outside. wants spend minute lives sweat stank hell hole...  even little surprised. I've paying daycare use since April. cool. Dems vacation.

Can acknowledge politicians abandoned us? Fuuuuuuuuck. Branch Covidians ones started fuss Waco? First get France... Yep. means triggering good strong immune response. 2 options beginning. coordinated , enforced, lockdown national leadership. nothing let rip. Option would cost us heavy price short term. Option B would cost us heavy price long term. Somehow, invented third option rest world decided avoid. choose half ass lockdown followed half ass reopening. result paying short term long term. country painted impossible corner horrible pain coming near horizon. Stay home. equity vaccine one? Oh shit, actually write out: herd immunity. Read couple times see it. AMLO, Bolsonaro Trump exactly same. Pardon me, useful, netizens outside US methods getting around WaPost paywall stopped working. find archive.is link article want read? happens quite often. Thank you! hoping fan Sasso. sure, outside better. But, pools magnet socializing. like resort pool Aruba St. Thomas go relax &amp; get away crowds. go Vegas friends meet &amp; socialize. one gigantic extended frat party.

 admit I‚Äôm chickenshit things like that, don‚Äôt trust body kill accident. looks peaceful hell. like it? often go? wouldn‚Äôt say future entirely bleak. Even spread herd immunity reached, would steal less life Americans traffic accidents, world, much, much less.

This tragedy, let‚Äôs keep perspective, won‚Äôt even steal much life obesity. even close. obesity something many simply trying normalize instead fight, even though highly preventable social side effects. UK pretty much shut everything. Europe. some. 

On March 25, brought law, Coronavirus Act 2020 providing range ""temporary"" powers government COVID-19 outbreak response. legislation place 2 years (and reviewed every 6 months).

This legislation far reaching powers described many UK politicians ""dystopian"". Ian Dunt labelled Act ""most extensive encroachment British civil liberties ... ever seen outside wartime"". considerable doubt parts Coronavirus Act even legal international law. Americans realising world revolve around them

Rich entitled pricks, yea got lot lets act anywhere near uniquely American problem. Sadly find hard believe. certain number, yes. think majority Trump voters want Trump president reveals values huge chunk American people. hope they're expelled. Selfish brats. Hey don‚Äôt lump them. voted Kodos. 5 year old. sure hell wear mask 8 hours school. buses? can't someone watching mask wearing buses. gonna work. animals equal, animals equal others. federal government adhering to, less advocating guidelines, help. That's main difference EU think, nearly governments actively promoting guidelines. I‚Äôm gonna show world without sin. one right would endanger another virus. 

If another way respirate without mask keeps others safe infection, welcome that, make easier cheaper ""It's 1875, Covid-19 even exist!"", proclaimed. wouldn‚Äôt rely different politicians saying different things current leader didn‚Äôt pass responsibilities down. yes basically comes vote Sure. want people take arguments seriously, would suggest leading something ‚Äúlet‚Äôs military order everyone homes multiple years vaccine available!‚Äù Texas need lockdown soon want ICUs overflow. become bad there. sort measure needs put place slow exponential spread another NYC New Jersey hands.

To put simply surface transmission occurs touch virus juice touch face. washing hands avoiding touching face block route. ‚ÄúAirborne‚Äù droplets hand completely blocked close people backed common sense. ""lockdown forever"", lockdown vaccine developed widely distributed. can't pull resources together develop something within 2 years I've lost hope country humanity whole.... put man moon can't this?? didn‚Äôt hit paywall inb4 angry Americans yelling Italian ruining liberty ignore law people going put tent people darn well know Covid. need supportive care yet, need eye kept them. need supportive care get moved room. long room open them. tent becomes waiting area rooms. need supportive care determining goes next. wait time exceeds time person wait trouble starts. problem people usually vent long time. kept unconscious entire time (obviously) need total supportive care entire time. Covid eats lot man hours. Looking chart, they've barely fallen past month, past two weeks basically flat aside normal weekly cycle. realize 0.15% = 15%, right? 11 million 15% population would mean world population 73 million. (This scenario world 7.3 billion make easier understand)

The world infection 1.5 PERCENT INFECTED. Jesus. 15% WORLD infected, ONE BILLION WOULD INFECTED. Christ. absolutely breastfeed toddler! biological indicators almost mammals nurse young baby teeth start falling greatest trick man every pulled convincing people god exists. get one cent, therefore one cent. double it, two cents. double again, four cents. say ‚Äúdouble amount get‚Äù every day. says double ‚Äúit,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äù amount have. isn‚Äôt hard. Dallas County ALONE reports 1,085 cases today. 

Here come shut down! mandatory voluntary? mean adequately funding public health measures research, considering least important military defense protecting citizens' lives livelihoods?  That's crazy talk. side effects seen year two vaccine? trials getting everybody else gotten vaccine themselves. ICU's Brabant patients transferred full? hospitals repurposed surgical wards COVID patients respirators beds 'normal' ICU? Granted, may like every hospital Holland, seeing normal ICU capacity 1100 beds 1400 COVID patients respitators, I'd say that's pretty damn close full. Yes, able scale amount beds 2400, simply using numbers disregarding regional factors fact actual, original, normal ICU's full. I‚Äôd love third butt-arm. H Like said it‚Äôs poorly written article kinda hops around bit, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs simple Byline it‚Äôs couple paragraphs call pfizer they‚Äôre rna vaccines points still stand rna vaccines hurdles face finding type vaccine first kind one successful. never hardcore patriotic American hard time screaming ‚Äúrock, flag, eagle‚Äù now.

Come America, get shit together. want military ‚Äúweld shut‚Äú families homes? 
That‚Äôs literally FASCISM. need get help. all. media drives narrative public reaction. connected. dirty foreigners now. point, family consider really wants go quality life after. wrong think anti-mask shit Facebook page denied first access it, make market? Would trust study guy research favorable industries give university tons money? referring strict measures took implemented lockdown March, i.e., fining people social gatherings, leaving home non-essential travel, etc.. Ok I'm unsure came first wether SARS MERS ever latter, would vaccine able pushed year however long one take.. given years prior research backing too? would thay taken usually time frame vaccine? Genuine question. #SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE..... DEATH What, think God omnipresent something? Yeah live middle nowhere It‚Äôs use Germany 14 Million phones. last name Trump? Cause sounds like something would say. podcast Danica Patrick pretty good. ""It important note implementing COVID-19 triage addendum time. However, plan place need arise.‚Äù

Doctor Christ clarified Thursday hospitals Arizona, including Banner, currently triaging patients.""

hopefully go far. lot people getting sick dead election. interested see auto immune complications. needs start happening.

The US refused address COVID19 seriously, leadership know care it. Depends country are, honestly. Houston Phoenix Florida, *definitely* want get now. authorities put mandatory quarantine (lock up) 14 days? may talk. Isn‚Äôt bad limited health care workers? 

I don‚Äôt know many secret service agents won‚Äôt eventually run keep getting infected? 

Why day age, pandemic, need travel person hotspot use resources? go branch give current statement. family member get DL. US Constitution include people's right freedom infect others disease stripped shopkeepers' right protect themselves, employees, family customers right set rules privately owned space ? Thats good point. Research universities probably sincere effort, experience academic research (I got PhD Oklahoma worked Vp research office part time), academic research funded corporate govt grants. There's often significant pressure get ""right"" results studies order obtain grant renewals.

I'll interested see releases first vaccine manage cost. Hopefully research/academic organization like Oxford little trustworthy. 2-7 days develop symptoms, average 20-odd days die. Unrelated. USA cares 2 things!!

1. Trump

2. Nascar

3. Sending souls heaven next podcast sat downplaying tens thousands Americans suffering hospitals right now. test employees countless applicants replace anyone gets sick dies! We're numb right. issue people talk Netherlands' public health policy towards COVID-19 sort positive model, wherein fact, resulted one highest per capita death rates. Italy lockdown vaccine. guy fucking around. Nobody actually thinks lockdown forever answer. stores enforcing state order? data require considerable qualifying. Antibodies part equation immunity, even know high antibody count virus strong correlate immunity. good news probably bad news could key, that's far certain. many things could mean including nothing all.

Immunology really, really complicated. someone feel challenged brain surgery rocket science, try immunology. mom didn‚Äôt get gardasil relatively new lot people still reactions it. made sense time don‚Äôt know never got later, ‚Äúsettled.‚Äù said, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll first line get *any* vaccine soon it‚Äôs available public. cookies? reminds couple NHL games grabbed goalie stands*. know least one^ successful rest team significantly alter game plan keep team even making shots. Dude couple nice saves though:)

*in NHL, teams usually goalie backup goalie. main gets injured, call someone minors, goalies get injured game, ‚Äúcall goalie stands‚Äù someone goes games free intent playing last resort. Obviously someone quite good hockey either good enough pros never interested pros. 

^the first game happened Chicago blackhawks game five years ago, nuts. later stated talking John Stewart kidding trying get bill go off. Could true Bill go glorious. listening podcasts definitely kidding. Nice try though lol means little word every respectable epidemiologist. Churches closed across US right now. aren‚Äôt allowed in-house services. moved online. Don‚Äôt believe everything read Reddit. fucked hit NY/NJ calm, new strain go back 95 hit again? Yep! watching sidelines going WTF?!?! Presymptomatic asymptomatic people spread covid-19, article month old official retracted statement misunderstanding. take vaccine bother someone else not? are, mind, president government.. ""Safe"". bother someone taking vaccine? stop stupid things like companies sending people like places need handle remotely.

I love free travel eating time company dime travel, almost never completely necessary. Masks suck much. ragged piece cloth full tons holes going protect anything.

I wish people would stop paranoid allowing media scare hell bs feeding us. later podcast Joe said trolling Bill get reaction. Joe claimed actually wear masks public. Yes take 500 doses vaccine please. agree. anyone know there‚Äôs fine place Michigan complying? That's simply true. Plus density cases specific areas outliers, large outbreaks country highly dangerous. be, are. [redacted] calling hoax, course going be. want get vaccine, skeptical US government claims. Angela Merkel says safe, I'm good. Well I'm excited August tell we're everything really hope improve. held patients hand cried screamed, ""Oh god, I'm going die, I? I'm dying"" told give oxygen without intubating putting life support.

Jesus Christ, that's terrifying. I'm glad returned instead trying every airport Europe they'd get didn‚Äôt actually call hoax. called Democrats‚Äô criticism federal response another hoax, like thought Mueller affair hoax. Lookup TGN1412 This! uncle buys medication that‚Äôs hundreds dollars states thirty dollars Mexico. Aha! That‚Äôs COVID-19 steel chair! one isn‚Äôt wearing masks care health experts say president doesn‚Äôt even care probably enough go around quickly people want. anti-vaxxers ill-informed worriers want give place line, it. I'll following lead doctors nurses, know analyzing healthcare risk do. reads like clickbait I'll call clickbait want get triggered feel free go it. :) Thank writing this. PhD working public health others understand prevention, research, data, etc. blows mind direction we're headed.

Example 1: Blowing money conferences workable follow-up towards change. ""The conference change people!"" No, not. 

Example 2: ""I care whether numbers extra 0 not"" - public health, trying data analysis really shoddy data. supervisor, field 30+ years stated me. WTF.

I honestly say worked everyone, lot incompetence within public health. Hah stupid mod. Unfortunately, required enter Finland Schengen state, could enter directly Turkey.  Yeeeenawww Oh god start. check typos next time. make sense all, second, third, fourth... hell even fifth. extraordinarily one dimensional way looking culture. America individualistic, UK, Canada, Australia NZ. fact hoftsede's cultural dimensions US, UK Australia 91, 89 90 (out 100). NZ Canada 79/100, still high global standards. Italy contrast 76 (Generally speaking European countries high individualism compared non-European countries). 

To imply high individualism culture means people care would mean Italian captain would *more* likely stay sinking ship compared British captain, opposite post saying. many cultural nuances factors play determine person acts society. 

I encourage look compare various countries 6 factors Hofstede's dimensions measures culture see think. one system cultural measurement, although quite well known popular one. think biggest flaw measurement Guilt/Shame Honour/Conscience spectrum- interested I'd also recommend reading differences guilt shame based societies. Northern Europe Anglosphere countries big guilt based cultures. India China shame based cultures. 

 feel like movie theaters kind dying thing last years anyway...I've got IMAX near liked going seeing things like interstellar, star wars, Dunkirk, etc big screen, I'll wait couple months takes get Amazon prime. Could?

They literally running people Detroit. Killjoys make noise. üòÅ

Everybody wants change world, nobody wants die... show made look worse entertainment value. little late people dying K Apparently people getting infected young. absolutely need keep away elderly numbers horrific. moron. ‚ÄúThis deaths new spike hasn‚Äôt time catch up, breaking news 9‚Äù like Ecuador burning bodies streets matter?

""Ahh, upgrades"" Median time postive test death 12 days. outbreak American South day 17. that's median, meaning half deaths day 5 (13k increase case baseline) outbreak happened already, plus half days 1-4, less half days 6-17.

And yet total deaths keep going down.

One two things happening. Either disease getting less dangerous many variety reasons, median time death getting longer. actually, two thing. virus overcome extreme patriotism every American participated community barbeque weekend without wearing undemocratic masks!
 
Yeah, age like milk ... number PCR tests reported day stayed even gone down, reported cases far bad things really fairness, meant Second Coming Never like one disbanded? I'm craving burger king thanks Yes, sort CENTRAL authority whose job CONTROL DISEASES.  Ugh, Arizona fire? Lol bad typed fast. meant implement. US several times cases daily Europe, including UK Russia. That's well twice US population. I'm fact, US several daily cases Europe, East Asia Oceania combined. Countries like Vietnam South Korea 80 50 million people respectively numbers nowhere near proportionate daily toll either. works, well it. Whatever numbers perspective somehow found clearly completely utterly wrong

hydroxychloroquine never previously demonstrated trace anti-viral anything. Guck you. mean? said corona Easter. excess deaths prior COVID outbreak. 


Over medicating unnecessary insurance mandated tests massive issue country. huge percentage people go medical care country, need prescription test, done placebo. end covid+ healthcare workers work. happened before, happen again.  might truth this. think ask USA people power properly tell citizens pandemic. comes people voting power.

Fuck. Thanks posting.

Edit: link without paywall http://archive.is/pmVK2 Yeah, even 10% dying plague, damned many people Florida. Without special reservoirs, recycling, etc there's enough water. Max infrastructure capacity used 13 million. There's 20 million now. Alright then; let's say %. 

If third population got infected would mean 69300-700000 Americans would die. Lets say keeps ramping like now, government deal amount carelessness, 1/2 2/3 population could get infected. 

Maths difficult. death toll millions. states locked prior outbreak reaching state, saw decrease deaths decrease hospital visits.

The states saw rise excess deaths also battling active Covid outbreaks, excess deaths causes could attributed Covid. rise excess deaths times Covid circulting areas. 


In states Covid outbreak, excess deaths drop hospitalizations.  


If excess deaths fear going HCP would see trend every state, every area. That's case. Neither here, internationally.  


The data support thesis. Hahahahaha leadership caring schools.

Lockdown March. nothing. Reopen bars.  OH FUCK schools! scoot Eastern EU country drop enough cash, might be. Everywhere world except one unfortunately. time numbers seem line reality, may revising bulk testing post-mortum, etc. really -- northeast least. Many/most schools shut spring break told students return campus. 

The issue spring break taking colleges/cities rest US, significant spike since places shutting around then. fall, we're talking reverse. think count universities hotspots, big question well contained there. living fear? elderly? People conditions put greater risk? facilities manage care? Seems people, fear good motivator else see replay saw April. 

For everyone else, see examples living fear. Instead, seen countless examples people giving shit driving case numbers up. 

Maybe took thing seriously early could opening right like every developed country world. 

This either/or proposition. doesn‚Äôt jive typical anti American redditor agenda, though. look comments here! Mexico racking significantly deaths USA days despite around third population. It‚Äôs really bad there. Poor means. We're humans. pick certain rules think justifiable ignore  Every single metric points spread April. Except confirmed cases, severely limited testing capability. Yes hotspots different places April now. wrong? done that? tell you, gotta plead ignorance thing anyone said anything first started sort thing frowned upon, know, ‚Äòcause I've worked lot offices tell people time. publically stated asked testing scaled back, pressed stood repeatedly. Congress also states less 25% allocated funds expanding testing even spent. best tell Imperial Study:

You give pol expected number dead current trajectory (status quo), expected number dead half-measures (bullshit fig-leaf policy), expected number dead implement recommended policy (rational policy). someone leaks numbers media think pol going waffle, including pol saw it. Best half-measures still horrible unacceptable. study legit would accepted medical community (and guys love trash talking other, shortcuts).

Pols know talk away certain number bodies point. fight wars way instead like Vietnam (lots contractors drones). bodies pile beyond certain number, even egomaniacs know can't talk away losses. usually want get fired, change policy. Interesting. That's less expected. sounds like they're taking seriously within limits human nature. Thanks detailed reply. cities population 100,000 Colorado require masks Daily death rates hospitalization rates way peak. Fact. trillions viruses, vaccine covers one time. care someone without contacting them? wife used work assisted living place helped dress, bathe, walk people There's politician anywhere, either right left, who's going prioritize anything else reelection. Ever think maybe deaths accurate ppl
Are actually recovering? ü§î We‚Äôre testing more, deaths lag cases, cases generally younger population before. say Florida isn‚Äôt fudging death numbers, we‚Äôre gonna see much wider gap cases deaths going forward past. plan along! 4D chess leader guy! Tremendous. ah yes, say something someone reply info, must triggered know this. That's rough. True good point knew expand people's ""one own"" mean ""humans"", there's easy answer that.

I think boils teaching people - especially children - emotional maturity, empathy, social responsibility. concept ""othering"" essentially dehumanizing anyone outgroup. Practicing empathy others humanizes them, empathy key part overall emotional maturity. 

The thing empathy 1. intentional 2. takes energy. teach people empathy skills, population people exhausted working much, paid enough, constantly bombarded messages telling Blame Other, there's almost space empathy happen. Well, history‚Äôs taught us anything, they‚Äôre used different set rules. they, though? refuelling stop, wink wink? less trying like trying prevent avalanche casting single vote it.  Also hand spirit mandatory.

Where Earth wrong? Bakery: refuse serve gay people

Go Italy! üáÆüáπ maybe people get sick using disinfectant wipes produce. I'm sick people telling me
1. like getting cold
2. like flu
3. worried, stay home
4. Wearing masks a) ""sheeple, b) makes pussy favorite c) dangerous health.

Like seriously, want fucking punch crotch can't pass genes. think mean Eastern Asia. India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran... much control.

Indonesia looking worse worse also, Philippines. Israel (though arguably ""Asian"" although they're part continent, slipping well. YouTube doesn't? Hell, even Google search help people find hate groups become emboldened... point singling out? Seems like talking point anything. literally wrote ifr Covid .1 .6% flu realm .01%. So.....no People fuck they're bored. unlikely scenario... dont worry us dumb üòÖü§£üòÇüòÑ Well put. made  Whether burden not, issue. Whether masks medically helpful not, issue either. question legality requiring mask wearing, especially public spaces.

Contrast beach cities WLA, masks worn less half everyone. Well always considered UFC career real joke, masks well go Brendan. still parts it. yet denied needed care.

Lol kinda tough Star game season hasn‚Äôt even started yet Glad hear taken care of! don‚Äôt think anyone sub gonna Cuomo mentioned 30k volunteers across country came help. Ofc I'm sure majority health care related. (Call center/test center help etc mixed in)

The scary part alot states may hit critical point (think NY/Italy) time. 

These states also happen largest economy population. God knows additional help come from. Also, federal backing real scary part. Everyone left fend themselves.

Let's hope enough high risk people took Social distancing/masks eleviate peak thats coming.

The situation sucks hard, seems alot people need experience know someone ""fell bike fractured/broke thier skull.....and would avoidable helmet."" 

Most America chose learn hard way. Let's hope painful. chart, they've barely fallen past month

""Barely fallen""? topping 1000/day one month ago 500 - 600 past two half weeks basically flat aside normal weekly cycle.

It showing almost exact downward slope May.

The beginning May showing 2000 deaths/day. 

The beginning June showed fallen around 1000/day.

Currently reaching 500s/day lowest point since march.

Despite happened past month 2, despite countless calls ""Just wait 2 weeks!"" daily death rate continued steady fall reached lowest point months. I‚Äôve surrounded idiots whole life. positive thing virus confirming suspicions. also look virus recovery subs, even literally *top comment* thread, people getting sorts symptoms virus. definitely sniffles telling you.

Does article say anything ICU???

I'm done argument. Let's pretend none ever happened, bad either mental healths. moment thought fake.

Covid never scared reason, even getting infected. Anyone else like ? We're racing see get herd-immunity brute-force infection vaccine comes out. See, people like say this, truth is, Florida DEFINITELY south. mean, Florida much brutal history slavery oppression rest south. cover better because, tourism brightest minds. greatest scientists. best doctors best healthcare.
 
40% population ignores recommendations. looks like buff adam driver idea, assumed hourly rate owned private jet

Maybe costs charter one. beaches much attraction Mississippi's icky waters. Gulf Shores MAJOR resort. 

Mississippi coast areas nightlife freaking casinos. Wall wall people casinos.

looks Vegas hand, controlling virus simple solution wearing masks. live (Wales), I'd guess fewer 5% people wearing masks, maybe 1%, we've fully taken virus control (26 new cases today whole country, 10 spread three major population centres), social distancing, restricting travel, closing locations high risk spreading disease.

I'm saying masks help, they're likewise end all. shown priorities truly lie... UK failed Empire take 2 weeks. Watch people get COVID vaccine, stop social distancing, GET covid, bitch hand, protests even 30% people wearing masks could potentially dangerous thing ever. People without masks could actually weaponize mask spreading droplets it. That's situation fucking sucks. way tested 5 years virus whihc appeared 6 months ago.

this kind nonsense makes people rightly trust reports. sad diarrhea/coma noises Oh dang they've heck run recently better rent room/suite time-share beach. Less crowd = less chances exposure. reason ppl head Vegas socializing pools &amp; clubs. like one gigantic frat party already college. thought president divisive, coronavirus takes cake. can‚Äôt even talk anymore people. someone tipped people shitting online view could potentially endanger fans. way interviewed Burr shitting people like restaurant server saw.

Accompanied right drug, severity COVID cardiac arrest risks (lack thereof), drug help. reason Falci (and UK docs) supported drug initially giving drug 20,000 patients two countries doctors realized helping ALL, doctors cut study short risk lives patients. outta Gerber baby learned read write, scientists workinh hard help patients provide correct information pass masses. think people hate Americans, personally every American I've ever met lovely person, like ruling elite.

Yeah ok sure also find interesting lot big Daily state numbers going 10,000 day, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs coincidence keeps happening again. agree much hope bears weeks ahead.

I'm sure people able compare crowd size protests versus reopening ones anti mask ones see effect argument there, mm-dd-yy dumb. 1930s: ""The thing fear fear itself.""

2020s: ""Losing fear sets stage disaster."" I'm sure is. I'm Arizona, scary premise. imagine they're going through. live blue San Mateo county people pretty compliant mask wearing. 100% inside outside 50-75% depending location virus deadly flu. mask symbol subjugation.

Yes course close dine anywhere want right now, bars food still open, there‚Äôs loopholes everywhere. 

There needs sense strategy Gov. Ducey gang. Every action opening early, reinforcing masks, etc. looked like spontaneous decisions without strategy. 

The office busy work without actually anything substance. Well shit Sadly, wrong... Honest question:

Why people blaming massive protests nation wide whole month? side effect chemical castration cancer 10 years. Thank posting, great article, really nice read response situations similar slightly stricter experts don‚Äôt think want stay hotel North Korea treat SARs patients single bullet. God acts mysterious ways. /s area certain supermarkets people better staying socially distant. makes sense difference exist, does, everyone noticed it. I'd suggest trying different supermarket chain. would impossible know extent long term immunity vaccine around long enough
.
These kinds obviously incorrect science reports help anyone. States 108k tests/million good enough 27th world metric.

If take meaningless places like Gibraltor, Monaco, Cayman islands, etc (Places basically population whose numbers skewed due - Let's use countries LEAST 1 million people), US ranks behind:

- United Arab Emirates (Who apparently tested 1/3 population)
- Iceland
- Denmark
- Lithuania
- UK
- Russia (Who almost certainly lying testing numbers)
- Cyprus
- Qatar
- Signapore
- Portugal
- Spain
- Israel
- Belarus
- Belgium 

Which would put 15th.

So yeah, others testing more? Sure - US actually lot testing definitely ""average"" testing department. Except 99%+ people get coronavirus survive without extreme problems. going deal front judge explain places shut judge.

Do want places shut time period least required make people using wear masks?

Yes hard legal guidance whether government require states even federally. Oh thought shutdown table duplicitous sack shit. 

If kept lockdown bit longer mask mandate facing again. always suspected US death low big country... (/sarcasm) Lol Italians come back Italy. 

From reading comments sounds like passengers US passports turned away, everyone else fine. fair employees don‚Äôt choice? experiments done that? conclusions published peer reviewed? hypotheses formed? articles, literally said linked article post article linked post doesnt even bring hand sanitizers.

Which one talked aboout it. Well boy good news think many people don‚Äôt know :)* remember right, first years dose lot higher eventually discovered necessary effective Damn, stay safe. Dig deeper Watson! us assholes, certainly segment. traveled Germany several years ago work colleague. complained loudly, within earshot locals, ‚Äúsome people can‚Äôt even speak English.‚Äù wanted crawl fucking rock. makes sense protests wouldnt super spreader events. everyone masks greatly reduces amount droplets spread period, end discussion. thousands articles I've read everything backs saying. Safety issue...efficacy is... first clinical trials (phase 1) test safety... phase 3 trials vaccines (and drugs) fail show benefit placebo equal standard care. fear people think 100% protected got vaccine. First, must wait 2 weeks (minimum time antibodies form immunoglobulin class switching). Secondly, vaccine 100% hopefully pretty damn good. time tell. Yup, used check numbers multiple times day, check States, see headlines like hit new highs. Rich people used told ""no"".

Actually think pandemic proving large swath people grew never told ""no"". coincide country I'm actively touch colleagues states seeing thing.

Again, invite actively look news news commentary. fair, newly infected rate hit zero everyone US gets infected Banner system Arizona posted critical care memo today said much would help figure means practice

Tennessee changed laws recently regards criteria hospitals use, none gotten point yet anyone explain conflicting timelines? I've heard promises fall, phase 3 trials Brazil scheduled last 12 months, July 2021. trial Brazil limited people 18-65

 [http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89951424](http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89951424)

General population months later - limited supply. Now, health care professional, violating canon ethics declining vaccination likely open disciplinary action. 

If plan waiting YEARS rather months people start getting vaccinated, hurting society zero gain number cases also much bigger say. remember early February, group Iranians abroad got tested another country, almost positive. true, they'd said along expect vaccinated *yourself* around Fall 2021. testing production, problem becomes logistical. However, we'll close effective herd immunity 20% population vaccinated, level fear *plummet* next Spring. lol heard too. boomers feed propaganda tit, pat themsevles back unique ""woke"" lol problem people think ok close businesses without compensating them. government destroys house make way new highway, least pay it. different destroy business? One wish answer soon: long-term permanent harm lingers recover. This, chance get re-infected months years road, greatest concern.

If re-infection permanent damage real, effective vaccine found, future looks pretty bleak. March 20th March 21st even lockdown all! March 2020 March 2021?

I get sentiment saying. rules March, confirmed rules March. amendment presumably rule easy abuse. ever chimed wished state update indeed occurred, made clear. comment hand spirit elaborate extent changes, admit would meaningful also mentioned Local's article. Yes precisely Lol sides here. know Sweden every citizen book test, current infection antibodies, free?

The application difficult duo overload, need pick date couple weeks away, nevertheless anyone get free test. Kinda hard drive another country Sardinia. numbers matter SERIOUS cases/ population.

What numbers compared SC?

Keep mind USA show sniffles neighborhood someone confirmed tested positive Covid (not serious way.. tested) assume covid. even full quarter we'd bit bullet shut completely start. recession would lasted maybe month, month half, we'd pretty good shape right terms covid terms economic prosperity.

Instead shutdown half-measure places almost non-existent others, STILL arsed that. Arrogant, conspiracy minded anti-maskers claim love America time comes make one tiny, simple little sacrifice it. 

Now we're sicker ever people want listen, corporations stoked fire, government unenthusiastic Gene Wilder ""no. Stop. Come back."" Gotcha, that's interesting.

I suppose 'qualify' wrong phrasing. meant, happens all, mean it? Normally, people never experience all?

I happen every often, sometimes hours. I've never noted ear worse, time. I'm going pay attention now.

Did many ear infections kid? did. wonder that's related all.

If insurance employer, may eligible transplant want guaranteed insurance rest life.

If don't, able afford medications body reject organ wasted.

Transplants easily cost million many insurance companies cost sharing policyholders shifts huge amount cost onto patient.

If cost issue, counted you. 

A lot transplant recipients fundraise order demonstrate hustle cover cost. doctor news DFW talking triage, almost broke pleading people take seriously. 

Dallas hit 100% earlier week, DFW area likely reach capacity next week many positives think are.  Wish could afford 2600sqft... Im lucky afford 900sqft apartment... barely afford that... many tests New York peak? Good good news. last 2 days March higher deaths.

Sure. general point daily deaths ""at lowest since Panic started"" yes curve falling slow word ""steady"" inappropriate. took 1 month go 1000 500. took 5 days March go 500 1000...

But see pattern pretty consistent countries. Regardless lockdown not-lockdown. countries showing similar far Media comment, dont think crazy one month ago everyone obsessing daily deaths? suddenly nobody talking really. 

And like said ""Lowest reported deaths months!"" would surely cool headline run. instead media focusing ""cases"", vast majority serious, asymptomatic. Possibly, yes. many lives could've saved... /r/LeopardsAteMyFace Bullshit There's going need enforcement penalties wear mask broad scale.   
To keep people's attention. somewhere donate cause? don‚Äôt know certain provide context pool owner who‚Äôs quite bit research pool chemicals. CYA concentration 50ppm(this like sunblock chlorine), keep pool around 4-7 ppm chlorine levels. enough prevent algae/bacteria etc. forming getting hold. 

If get ‚Äòsomething‚Äô pool, need crank pool like 24 ppm chlorine extended period time maintain levels. 24 hours usually. 

So would say, it‚Äôs probably correct normal chlorine levels would necessarily kill virus contact. still school pre covid. least America got hit hard healthcare workers willing strike stop happening, happening. had/has interesting people across wide range genres.

The Moderna vaccine uses partially deactivated RNA lipid carrier. technique shows promise safety missteps past. believed safety issues resolved. good news safety issue shown early previous tests expected emerge late. Moderna vaccine generate strong immune response Oxford vaccine. It‚Äôs phase 3 testing probably scrutinized this. three easiest manufacture many people want technique succeed holds great promise rapid response vaccine future pandemics, cancer, diseases treated via targeted immune system response.  you‚Äôre desperate understand situation PM Yea know it‚Äôs extra cautious. living two parents late 60‚Äôs never cautious.

Feel free go somewhere else. purely political? Public perception health experts relevant discussion have.

\-Dr. Anthony Fauci - Mar 2020 Thank you. really trying insensitive think I'd right word. use help water stations desert long ago. pretty bad want travel far gallons water. I've also fed folks to. County. one larger counties AZ going 2-3.5 thousand cases every day, that's accounting week-plus backlog. I'm wondering, given trial/placebo encouraged go general public encouraged to? example, going restaurants even though technically allowed. someone trial might encouraged go restaurants public spaces (safely) prove effectiveness? Gee, outrageous costs American 'health care system' people coming way late, edge death..... maybe, MAYBE, there's correlation two? like technology use called ChAdOx1. Even smartest important people appreciate good meme.  basing studies Europe kids schools months closing all. single know outbreak attributed schools open. economy starting take again

This sounds like Trump Co saying, think important frame appropriately. Remember, Dow Jones economy. 11% unemployment staggering figure probably lowball given safety measures etc leading underemployment. Great Recession unemployment peaked 10%. Touting 11% kind great success reflect reality, we've begun see gonna play out. wait expanded unemployment ends end July. wait kids begin school almost entirely distance learning (forcing people stay home). 11% tip iceberg.

Please take none lecturing personally - think important put ""the economy coming back"" line context. applaud guts stand health cost employment. That's hard stand take. large-scale retrospective analysis 2,541 patients hospitalized March 10 May 2, 2020 across system‚Äôs six hospitals, study found 13% treated hydroxychloroquine alone died compared 26.4% treated hydroxychloroquine.

They gave group got hcq steroidal treatments lol. Also sound like complete lunatic. yoga membership canceled February. Got confirmation place would canceled. Despite closed March, still got charged March April. Kept disputing charges credit card company sent email cancelation confirmation. Turned company manually entering monthly fees avoid automatic re-occurring charges shut credit card company. company eventually stopped May, I'm sure plenty got screwed them. Excellent column anyone know we're infected new ""strain"" covid that's contagious? We're seeing outbreaks workplaces &amp; cohorts managed keep infections quite stable long time since March adherence safety protocols. seems regular safety measures longer enough. Surgeon General big scary word him. interesting podcast talked paying people stay home, saying even payed 2-3k month, would still save money long run reason stitch Canadian flag patches backpacks travelling around world: want mistaken guys (I joke, common differentiate, especially watching disaster unfold outside perspective). recent publicized case Europe increased risk narcolepsy resulting vaccine used H1N1 August 2010, Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) Finnish National Institute Health Welfare (THL) launched investigations regarding development narcolepsy possible side effect Pandemrix flu vaccination children,[5] found 6.6-fold increased risk among children youths, resulting 3.6 additional cases narcolepsy per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. nothing fundamentally different his, ""We mandate masks"" ""we mandate masks"" terms evidence.

And I'm telling what's going behind scenes.

Believe I'm disengaging conversation leading where. fuck think social media is.
It's bunch crazy, unheard, minority. 
We worry them. Ok let‚Äôs wait 10 years former teacher, think good argument special needs kids deserve go back in-person school, would less Petri dish. Genuinely believe neurotypical kids fine without in-person classes &amp; many kids back school epidemiological nightmare unless strict enforcement social distancing masking admins (and be, faith admin right thing... one reasons left teaching). Please learn something immune responses work. antibody responses cell responses. antibodies may disappear, cell response likely protective many years ‚Äî Covid patients producing lasting cell responses Interesting strategy!

I think one time lost dictator Congo shot people infection country. disappointing. I've definitely lost times freaking Greenland

... Maybe move Greenland. ü§î greatest public health policy failure modern times.

It studied Harvard Kennedy School case study generations.

And Trump, Birx, Fauci Surgeon General going starring roles. Something barn door [Bill Burr roasts Joe Rogan saying masks She‚Äôs physical therapist reason honey Right? thought VP going talk sense 'ol Ronny, instead gave pat back said ""good job."" 

Everything must fine guess ¬Ø\_ („ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Super Bowl 51 21st century?  currently reporting lowest number daily deaths since breakout began. Daily deaths lowest since another universe, would big headline. universe, one news agency running it. Yeah, selfish people going bars!! popular Trump among young voters? get it. I'm saying argument apply, I'm saying personally enough reason agree forceful government vaccinations. see infected person contact *people know* may exposed, contact tracing also involves identifying *strangers* may come contact with, public transport coffee shop. Hopefully they're that, right? RIGHT? Except they've already studied saw become less severe... people heads stuck far sand. First Amendment Constitution makes policy highly unlikely stand court. 

So far, judges allowed bans worship services continue. However, imagine there‚Äôs long legal fight ahead. likely correct, say rare. thought I'd chip since one 3 warnings give prior vaccine. people learn happy anyway Neither shutting everything putting people work. I'm Chinese-Canadian thought same. 


""Oh, go crazy countrymen getting crazy shit again. Good thing I'm there's way gonna... oh fuck."" Fauci said unfair expect black brown people speak government scrapped contact yes ing tool. He's using better tools, said. feel bad you. destin month ago social distancing masks barely exist. Thankfully place doesn‚Äôt many cases would never able tell pandemic. Beaches closed weekend South Florida supposed quarantine 14 days come state. nobody enforces sister 30-40 person wedding month. I'm almost certainly going.

Might get family's shit list. looked up, you‚Äôre right. Learned something new today. point still stands refusing service legal. British usage Requiring school make craziest get *anywhere* monolith? I've seen argument lot, seems miss point broad generalizations made. Nobody said US nation identical clones. anyone pays taxes..the government could literally show doorsteps tomorrow. don‚Äôt get people think government wants anything Imagine society focused almighty dollar day everyday show off... world!! Virtually every celebrity pro-mask though pro-science. i.e. he's looking way win election. go Safeway mask that‚Äôs problem.

Weird. store near us that's family stores they've strictest masks entire time. Even CA reduced mask requirements still required door. Social media ruined last relationship. lucky turned terrible. Thank young kids hate messenger. Love Firefly / Serenity reference surrendered plutocracy.

that happened hell long time ago nothing It‚Äôs straw man all, know didn‚Äôt say didn‚Äôt imply did. clearly didn‚Äôt understand point.

Also, taxing online purchases pandemic encouraging online purchases people don‚Äôt leave house? That‚Äôs insanely counter productive.

Stopping tax returns middle/lower class too? That‚Äôll get ton support.

You realize whole even better expanded UI many middle class people still taking big pay cut it, right? survive pay cut another 8 months?

It‚Äôs fatalism. Lock elderly pre existing conditions. Pay stay home. I‚Äôm 30 relatively healthy, let go work, mask need be, keep moving forward. us get this, it‚Äôs reality point. protect vulnerable 99.999% rest us fine -and better keep working locked down. wish news organizations would say ""Nothing Trump says true we're repeating anymore"" Lol love Google fear mongering Texas almost 30 million residents geographically double size Germany. means since huge region numbers need higher truly comparable hardest hit regions Speaking vaccines I'm actually hoping comes Government releases data many people vaccinated per day I'm actually interested data fast people getting vaccinated. slower worldwide testing covid that's actually worrying. Actually reinfections relapses according WHO. cases people kill coronavirus, body stays heightened state even goes even harder thinking coronavirus still extant.

Then starts attacking major organs person's body like mother Christine Ann Kidwell Maryland.

Once happens? screwed, little point stop Cytokine Storm. really know say. misleading title. study look easily children spread disease. looked amount virus infected kids vs adults. probably correlation two, right make statement title without actual data. Far fewer kids contracting would make less likely get spread it. Also, sample size 23 really tell anything all. It'll interesting see pans full year. 2020 higher death toll higher peak deaths pandemic window? Abbot going event. Leading example! disgusting. participated getting us level inaction. someone wears mask stays inside protect doesn‚Äôt absolve us actions last generation plus brought us here. 

Jesus Christ, dude. pathetic response whole American, primarily due choices last 30+ years. Embrace corona, it‚Äôs really chance society left. assume haven‚Äôt rely benefits government time. Stupid people take vaccine. Sorry, stuck them.

Indeed, are. need minimal herd immunity better control hot-spots spikes. It‚Äôll definitely challenge compounded fact it‚Äôll ‚Äúnew‚Äù vaccine.

... **and** need push folks get vaccinated seasonal flu coronavirus avoid overwhelming healthcare resources again. 

We work cut us next months, well foreseeable future. Completely wrong Yeah, political statement, they‚Äôre probably actually handling worse us somehow. already blew Abbott. Lt. Gov. Patrick cancelled Vegas trip Fall due family, lived alone I'd going sure. definitely need think people around you, self quarantine possible changes everything. spray shit Florida chem-trail style? consent entire state protect elderly forcing millions children interact hundreds peers dozens adult teachers every day? Bringing whatever get home back adult parents elderly grandparents/guardians?

We living Ocarina Time, adult world child world. protect elderly limiting *everyone's* social contact. big deal. wear mask still. like opinions influence me. want to, care. 75% people Walmart near today wearing one. They're also fat, I'm really fit, force healthy safe. perogative. I‚Äôm LA, haven‚Äôt inside single store everyone wasn‚Äôt wearing masks. Now, plenty people wearing masks correctly, noses hanging out. Well yeah nobody requiring quarantine coming back there. People want travel. cases Maine, go there, don‚Äôt deal annoyance coming back It'll latter violate order welded homes. People selfish what's best public interest. Deaths ""stayed steady"".

They fallen constantly past month.

They currenly lowest point since perfect example media writing reality you. exactly said. Yeah, vote invest stuff matters. Harvard MIT jackshit coronavirus response lol one cares them. also best public school system country, public school students 2nd world math reading comp scores. closest thing US universal healthcare nearly free healthcare low income residents 98% citizens insured.

Again, voted things. don‚Äôt magically best hospitals, best universities, best school system, legal weed, nearly free healthcare, etc. voted smart candidates. voted pay things matter us. Taxes high us decided high taxes worth it. based well state many fronts, clearly worth it.

There‚Äôs reason state can‚Äôt things. us example evil ‚Äúliberal‚Äù policies work. still choose to. Couldn‚Äôt tell why. gave Joe Rogan long time ago. beginning comedians happy stoners saying funny things came wack-a-doo guests conspiracy theories. Eddie Bravo becoming insufferable. three hour plus podcasts becoming untenable time sink. kept hanging hoping would go back old format. last nail coffin Alex Jones.

If Joey Diaz i'll maybe catch that, I'm poorer missing podcast. cadence tone post teacher like, love üôÇ Yeah NY knows want get early. 

They want go again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps bar owners Florida could learn this. deaths lag 4-5 weeks. 

schools would opening pretty soon horrible spike deaths. cross-site scripting - blocked.

Do need wear clothes?

Can take shit street?

Can sleep there?

I mean constitutional rights too. Sweet lockdown's over. Open up! mean don‚Äôt think much testing available holiday insecure get? Bill rightly tore apart too. Long term? virus hasn‚Äôt around long. That‚Äôs great antibodies, long lasts can‚Äôt known certain enough time passes.... like know, 6 months, 12 months.... Beach probably responsible place right now. Outside, lots space, taking care immune system fresh air, activity, sunshine... haven‚Äôt heard outbreaks occurring beaches. myrtle beach one came house party, beach. totally false. Everyone talking fall/winter goes well. successfully eliminate human capital stock. Maybe plan make bad possible people? Yeah patient load exceeds ICU capacity, ERs choice triage patients; something medical staff lifetime.  That's gotta rough. think we'll locked starting August. Many hospital systems overwhelmed then. still get infected antibodies wear off, according epidemiologists saying. made things worse rather helped.

His ""mistake"" cost lives thousands. What‚Äôs Americans believing science? What‚Äôs going there? I'm personally skeptical companies developing vaccine already announcing much cost. I've hearing around $2500 USD per dose (which honestly lower expected). even found working, approved vaccine. price point becomes unattainable people lower quality insurance laid COVID. 

That combined fact previous coronaviruses still vaccines tells legit solution, profiting catastrophe. little incentive case create working vaccine-it look like working enough get people buy it. want see hard evidence works believe greedy big pharma types selling anything snake oil. point, it‚Äôs time everyone prepare get virus US. many cases undetected due hitting capacity tests, methods contain virus likely result even bigger overall damage society. Mandatory mask order one done slow spread somewhat least society impact. Even self interest, helping people out. That's see least. wouldn‚Äôt say every American deserves risk suffocating death heart attack, jobless, homeless, getting others around love deathly ill... government crap. every American loud mouth selfish pig, regular people want live regular life dangerous deadly circumstances failure government *they might even voted for*. 

It‚Äôs government officials punished, American people hostage them. There's tons visitors state license plates though. Lots Don‚Äôt let slow protesters! 

Fight right! 

Continue fight!üî• Right that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening see body bags friends family. probably group buy extra discounts body bags coffins.  pretty likely considering vaccine born research made SARS vaccine. 6 family members Miami tested positive yesterday. Lets hope things get better you, mate

Best Wishes Love Pakistan COVID Trump going get Mexico build wall. American friends different places around world, feel like misinformation campaign targeting Americans America. friends places, well American friends they're fucked head perception management. friends outside united states, Americans, Europeans, Africans, Asians, over, much reasoned rational perspective. 

I know rational people united states, undermined continuously. 

The question asking is, many moves ago checkmate inevitable? see reason changing anything now. numbers look great. total number cases ICU. Blue - reported. Grey - estimations places reported God üôè prideful idea we're never wrong want told we're wrong. _smoke &amp; mirrors, smoke_ Texas Florida enforcing mask mandate even one. Next week numbers tell tell. we‚Äôre going fucking contain shit open fucking borders please. 

I without s/o 7 months since one gonna fucking help, might well go now. 

OPEN BORDERS YOURE GONNA TAKE SHIT SERIOUS So, basically, there's really enough evidence governments justify making wearing masks mandatory. Which, presumably haven't. 1918 Great Influenza primarily killed young adults, strong immune systems. elderly exposed related H1N1 virus decades prior, immunity.

We know fact immune response causes acute respiratory distress syndrome kills Covid-19. immunocompromised may fact better prognosis:

 Well first I‚Äôm happy idiots means get mine sooner. longer term. :-( Yeah, nuts. counties cities made mask ordinances, lot people wear masks, compliance high enough.  state limit capacity stores restaurants. even closed bars (but governor).

 help governor, would useful. 

He reminds 5-year-old refuses swallow medicine, taste good. would rather continue sick. words right order? Hey friend article three months old speaking deaths, cases. Please check information. bit  strong statements considering haven‚Äôt even started trials. would expect vaccine company shooting results. don‚Äôt think anyone would like. ‚ÄúHey want vaccine work 3 months.‚Äù 

This seems like marketing similar cancer cures come end lower expected results. I'm sure people would refuse also people judge much safety data required. Oh, wait, already judging safety data done collecting. ya must psychic. Positivity rates 20%+. Funny thing used play grandma like 30 years ago. I‚Äôm millennial well. same. you‚Äôre contacts. I‚Äôm answering. it‚Äôs urgent. They‚Äôll leave msg. Looks like make sense, local news mainstream media rn talk one less lethal contagious matter people taxes, US already 22 trillion debt, cares trillion more! Trump playing 4D chess make Mexico build wall. Say what? illegal real world.

I see Planet Fitness sued losing case. arent getting work done home. issue jobs dont direct numbers (like claims filed). Work paying take care kids. USA Number ONE! Huge data asymptomatic patients. many studies prove that.

Let‚Äôs look WHO. 

For COVID-19, data date suggests 80% infections mild asymptomatic, 15% severe infection, requiring oxygen 5% critical infections, requiring ventilation. Remindme! 3 months would cancel. Going Las Vegas smart move foreseeable future. Good. Kudos Italy showing backbone here. guy begging us buy masks months ago? lightening fast makes nervous

That's things trialed speak. asking Karen's crash test dummy's.

It's downright silly think way ostensibly tested/trialed. local, state, even federal government trying ""rush"" something sloppily. vaccines development closely watched highest-level medical advisors countries world. 

The prospect individuals ""uncomfortable"" vaccine disheartening. Rich people think rules apply them. surprise. Cool. make everyone wear mask order get vaccine one last FU. Solid list right That's exactly think end doing. Best insurance purposes compliance - especially elderly. hear Rep. saying is: 

""Respect right increase odds infecting others!"" hello pedo Generations low education standards, Corporate political propaganda, culture often rewards ignorance. example compare salary pro athlete's research scientists U.S. start understand. seriously think moment someone catches virus drop dead, instant spreadsheet public health department count clicks one more? sucks many us parents consume hot garbage constantly Fox self-lobotomized.

Also photo jet that‚Äôs sitting. Engine covers don‚Äôt go unless it‚Äôs sitting (like car covers). side effects years line. 

Has ever actually happened approved vaccine side effects discovered years line? understand ICU capacity ICU beds thing... Right? Superb comment. good weekend! Heck, I'm millennial pick numbers know. much spam. matters keep hearing sports talk radio hosts make point professional athletes died COVID, sports safe. 

No, not. Sports reopening kill athletes' family members people. Gives new meaning ""Special"" Forces least cause issues employer liability since required take it.

I completely believe vaccines go full testing regimen. one getting rushed though. California waiting shoe drop. know massive wave deaths doorstep. sad fact phase epidemic onus prevention &amp; mitigation shoulders &amp; every one us. can't lock again, can't dusk dawn curfews. can't even enforce masking distancing public, let alone stop ppl gathering private homes. recklessness drunken infatuation partying &amp; socialzing downfall. countries Asia Nordic region culture &amp; temperament better suited self-control social distancing. us Golden State. We're literally dead set partying virus strikes us down. Spain pretty much reopened, strict social distancing, that‚Äôs possible masks, things work pretty well here. county seems pretty hell bent letting happen help it. I‚Äôm guessing lot stores might franchises depends local management spot reason U.S. locking (but won't, government care lives citizens) specifically people refuse follow rules. U.S. culture toxic individualism runs deep people would rather put lives people around risk mildly inconvenienced. colleague work says won‚Äôt take pal went hospital taking vaccine.

I said (as elderly obese woman) virus 20% chance killing her, vs virtually zero risk vaccine. *Virtual Hug* double down. Maxwell also developed Oxford University. ran owned first division soccer team idea. honest reading response probably mention legal reasons, linked prior vaccination, rather scientific basis make sure they've covered bases. Okay? Point? Social media general FB created entire population waste. one particular development since 2012. originally designed MERS passed safety testing, MERS similar enough SARS-COV-2 simple modify. No, doesn't. 

If getting work done working home, business employer manage children? high proportion Texas's population non-white hispanics blacks work service economy.

If keep public schools closed fall raging pandemic, over........ can't work even wanted to. unemployment benefits time dried up.  Reported Mod abusive/offensive. US experiencing cases daily. would referring cases. sarcastic said money object thing correlation China

As independent observer, indeed needless exchange ! They're probably accurate; they're probably under-reported. Mexican government think building wall. I'd use stealth masturbation already explained comment why, let repeat:

Some people can't get vaccine immunocompromised, vaccine actually damage good them.

Some people might develop antibodies vaccine. best vaccines work 98% time. I've read someone saying really happy Coronovirus vaccine works 70% time.

To protect two groups people, need vaccine work take vaccine, get disease spread can't become immune. So, no, taking it, entire ""herd"". Hence, herd immunity. vaccine works 100% time many people possible take them, beat lot terrible diseases. able beat coronavirus well vaccine works 80% time, long 100% people take - take it. song reference. Yes, low viral detection huge! Plus, fact antigen test antibody test makes way useful. Companies test employees start every week, person CoVid-19 system - whether show symptoms mounted immune response - know 15 minutes! worry fact internet also recruitment tool crazy unheard minority. could wear masks. hope play Ugandan Pallbearer song drill irony. fair, never pick number recognize.

They make shot bigger it'll help, can't make immune system bigger. put enough different virus strains in, eventually starts look like noise.

In practice, they're already riding trade-off trying pick likely strains include, picking cutoff point maintains effectiveness. years process seems easier successful others. that's noon. *Sigh* I'm sure whole ""lauded"" response stuff, shit sure hit fan Texas.

And slightly related also slightly off-topic... Medical research tied viral reservoirs things like chicken pox/shingles immune neurological disorders like MS Parkinson‚Äôs, even chronic migraine stroke. aren‚Äôt yet sure damage longterm damage covid-19 might cause. 

I‚Äôm extended medical trial MS (it‚Äôs great, btw!!) get sick MS flair-up, stop trial. There‚Äôs way afford cost treatment without trial, even current insurance.

On hand businesses spend huge amount money effort planning past current quarter. Product roadmaps typically go years future. Many large projects take years complete, even planning done.

Even retailers, arguably quarter focused companies market, plan pretty far future.

Take simple example; every retailer planet wants sell stuff China. company decides start working today even get finished preliminary planning meetings end quarter. They'll feasibility studies, make business case, deal local international regulators, procure real estate, hire staff, arrange shipping logistics. Executing plan year would considered fast.

Because never feedback, celebrated anything do, matter stupid is. exact opposite asian upbringing, people quite low selfesteem, many cases viewed negative, scenario positive personality trait, dont think competent people willing listen experts. Trump pinnacle culture, seems honestly believe competent professional epidemiologists topic. Oh, fully understand that, tangible number look understand.

The hallmark pandemic America seems patchwork nature response. Seems like drive hour direction hit different set protocols, restrictions, requirements.

Our county pretty well, state's watch list lot indoor business restricted again.

Instead playing whack-a-mole virus, would better served strict, nation-wide lock 6-9 weeks followed track trace. current piecemeal system makes lockdowns ineffective virus hangs states, counties, etc lax restrictions spreads back areas lockdown. Haha - make Americans delusional? pump water? health system criminal. cops appear rejects School Lobotomy everyone sticks cameras peoples faces look wrong way. Yep. Texas Florida beyond fucked point pool water may vector transmission deluded think pool setting whole holds element risk. insane political message. can‚Äôt think worse response current situation this. wow.

Don't get wrong bars closed, people stop pretending protestors immune virus. vote make comments support abolishing net neutrality. mean, many instances rules *don't* apply wealthy way poor mean nobody's surprise countries, TON original spread involved rich New Yorkers traveling LA Miami ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù lol. Exactly! He's quoting yesterday's numbers. post removed article. Nope. live New York City bought another house temporary inconvenience, think it‚Äôs safe say upper class. this...will Trump Biden fall? actually spiking upstate NY fyi downstate still trending well. Ya chips don‚Äôt track you. also mind control liberal vote gays.  speaks truth. governor lamented Government's rules clearly written forbid shit. clear got tested positive times? sure assumption, correct?

Also wonder ever left. Seems like enough testing know sure, seems ancedotal think might stay system necessarily reinfection. 

Either way sucks. Hope get better.  allow people work compensate them.

  China, subject confirmation reciprocity Huh must dropped.I've seeing reports low 1s, regions hitting 2+.

Ahh well, bad. yeah, general point still stands first heard Maths+ treatment ... shouldn‚Äôt bigger news? early cocktail cortico-steroids, anti-coagulants vitamins reduce intensity illness prevent people needing intubated? know States reopened going fucked. Maths+ quantifiable (albeit likely statistically significantly quantifiable due low sample size) effect covid-positive population? sounds like news Leave Nah, many question marks peds.

GSP P4P number one. Khabib though. That's less yesterday! flattening curve!

Mission accomplished Maybe let‚Äôs consult former cage fighter C-rate comedian public health guidance. need chip implanted skin. seems downstate, spikes usually end nursing homes meat packing plants. literally chance actually true. may nodding smiling, trust me, Americans despised pitiful creepy laughing stock everywhere Europe. love opentable data! I‚Äôm tickled made available. see coming mistake addressing issues start:

About testing dead: tests done living patients, results updated passed (some places ave delays processing big volumes tests) every day daily reports include these. also tests patients already died, confirm suspicious cases.

Also, big correction done June 6th committe, precisely regarding ""invisible cases"": died tested. day number casualties increased without precedent, data Johns Hopkins already considers cases. Sure, statistical excercise, done information world regarding transmission rates, % asymptomatic cases, genral spikes uusual unusual death rates country, make important correction data.

There's also circumstancial evidence allows us see scenarios:

While USA severe problems solve healthcare systems, staff resources proportionally population, well better quality healthcare.

Mexico facing decades long insufficiency healthcare system regarding coverage, staff, technology resources. Even that, hospital capacity nationwide (overall beds ICU units ventilators) remained occupied 50% nationwide. yet, worst place Mexico City suburbs. Comparing NYC, USA went rapid spike, Mexico City never saw tragic scenes overcrowded hospitals (and hopefully never will).

So yes, things problematic everywhere, bad Mexico USA, consecuences would way noticeable way worse, since would increased effect economical issues problems already precarious healthcare system.

And address last point: way trying make superiority contest. Human lives lost whole families pushed towards misery world. point is: sure, I'm better informed Mexico (and know USA, Mexico, federal response, also state-level response also make things go differently place place), I'm comparing Mexicos' response USA: I'm comparing bad virus hit Mexico compared USA. said before, (or gets) bad Mexico USA, would worse overall. Ya nobody wants people California state Yes tragic horrible. sorry. Note working backwards ""hundreds millions"". high. Elect clown. Expect circus. would watchable TV series. 
This season ""Fuck Yo' Laws""... TBH, usually don't. Lived multiple countries least 6 metropolises, know?

Wow that's one biased database I've ever seen one. Tank Abbott? No, no, unrelated practice social *dick*stancing. Easy enough confuse. Happens time. optimism endearing. 

If everyone actually following recommendations phase probably point now. :( Gives new meaning term ""going bang""... Thailand saw strike healthcare workers tv yesterday. Sorry remember sure, believe Arizona. thought was, striking, taking care patients? saying healthcare workers paid &amp; help, freaked think less care hospital strike. Exactly. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong country prohibiting people entering think pose danger. cuts ways there‚Äôs nothing wrong that. Dude I'm rejecting age ranges. I'm rejecting notion Corona parties. Americans finally waking realizing nobody likes  air immediately water? I‚Äôm UK. take point. looking worth everyday. top that, started get control. tons people eased are. NZ always region unlocked systems like DVD Blu-Ray players. probably size market ""special benefits"" Ummm...no. case everybody walking around cellphones, massive invasion privacy. Orwellian stuff. Unfortunately, like 9-11, public going give ever rights privacy left name safety. go store today pick medication. packed full people I'd say maybe 25% wearing masks. socially distancing. Masks mandated state I'm in, store enforcing it. lose little faith humanity every time leave house. Everyone brain knew coming. Opening restaurants bars fucking stupid, especially considering neither even close essential. But...but...the mortality rate low, need worry, we're overreacting. mortality rate inevitably rise ICUs overwhelmed need close ENTIRE BORDER like Canada did. Canafa closed border almost 4 months ago USA open since. think going happen? friends live Albania years now, still USA passport. Nobody outside community talk them, can‚Äôt even get Grease despite proof residency Albania. Congrats!!! took Grandson 4-6 weeks started getting it...no letter, nothing. Stay well! Corporations people immune virus, slow meatbags dying? Eh, really. handled properly could greatly help get us past this. Handled poorly won‚Äôt anything all. 

Actually glad see Apple google running vs government.  seem suggest article flight originated US which, regardless passport, going quarantine for.  less 10 years ago people touting revolution revolutionized society made everything better.

Now know countries banned Facebook. Fake news spreads easily much harder combat, least countries need maintain least illusion free speech.

The real funny thing free speech never applied companies. government opened social media website public funds, would able enforce free speech censor anything, Facebook right delete fake news yet act.

Do 366 reddit accounts? closed Thank &lt;3 really appreciate sharing cant people think ahead. Yes virus high survival rate young people. happens hospitals fill though? happens large amounts people need take least 2 weeks job? seems concerning survival rate. u Thank clarification. Fingers crossed. not, happen would. shouldn‚Äôt hate country country. together. many people throwing blind hate united states American‚Äôs general. love Europe, love Europeans. one hates asshat running country get that, don‚Äôt throw baby bath water. get American tourist annoying, think ‚Äúpeople vacation‚Äù annoying. Ive seen Australians, brits, Brazilians making asses selfs vacation. Dosnt mean hate country dont understand rights freedoms. drive testing Houston? Yeah cause new infections lag like deaths do.

The battle new infections yesterday already over. count losses there. battle deaths infections even started end maybe month two. point go count losses.


We also look well outbreak currently contained based many infections per million people are. stat lag. We‚Äôve telling ages mate, fucking ages. stop screaming USA NUMBER ONE you‚Äôre actually somewhere high 50s, you‚Äôll little tolerable.  Horrible time parent young kids Thank you! Considering source, that's compliment. Highly inappropriate. I‚Äôm talking people catch disease. I‚Äôm talking people taking rules guidelines seriously ie wearing mask. 

But yes disease seem affect certain groups more. absolutely disparage them. Sorry anything said led conclusion. still thick I‚Äôve read gathered don‚Äôt know disproportionately affecting groups. could well come socioeconomic status people. core recent protests. Point being. Shit sucks America rate going future bleak. mentioned nationality one passengers. Maybe there's something deduce that. Imagine reading thinking government annoyed sort retribution incredibly reckless arrogant behavior. Mexico know outbreak worse US side?

In Tijuana, they‚Äôre barely testing (2881 cases, 854 deaths really, 30% cfr?), most-infected areas San Diego neighborhoods bordering Tijuana. Trump plans. Nobody said well thought plans. Americans' discipline

LOL Booze cheaper supermarket anyway... Canada rural place

Canada urbanized country North America, 82% population living cities. Yes, Canada lockdown, country starting open (with regulations) resurgence virus US without lasting financial impacts. Thanks! would flaunt They‚Äôre showing fancy laws? Bling bling. right-wing politician whining obey rules prioritise people profit? Say ain't so! Oof, 46% positivity rate? case anyone wondering that‚Äôs number you‚Äôre shooting for! won‚Äôt know today‚Äôs numbers today over...  Thanks Karen! double deaths great job That‚Äôs pretty disturbing something wouldn‚Äôt considered Danish schools back since mid April middle worst managed get control. oh yeah. fucked. One five require hospital care.Mild symptoms mean hospital care (you could sick bed month it‚Äôs still mild case don‚Äôt go hospital). think thinking 99% don‚Äôt die. Yup. easy get passport Malta sort rich flies private jet (I believe requires owning property Malta valued 1m euros, much money super rich, even rent make profit), Schengen zone, problem-o. could still end screwed. closest airport fair bit non jet charters appears dead. Medical charters good part company's profits operating elective surgery's cancelled here.

If one regional airline fails entire airport profitable operate. yesterday ya? Currently showing 45k me. Excuse American SMD   hope enough high risk people took Social distancing/masks eleviate peak thats coming.

I'm sure understand logic here. High risk people often get infected think they, healthy die infection, social distance wear masks. talking people giving virus high risk people, pass on? I'm asking due many people thinking wearing mask protects person wearing masks &amp; masks available going protect people wearing masks. mask protects them, me. I'm high risk &amp; go twice month medications can't delivered &amp; groceries. Oh yes totally right, percentages 7-day averages. Sorry mentioned that. I‚Äôm 31 years old hated far back remember Hahaha! That's hilarious! Germans even mine 2+ year old Galaxy S8+ right, since UK never part Schengen matter case. rural areas worse wearing masks mean protests bad either. infection rate 1.4% way actually much greater protesters mostly young overwhelmingly asymptomatic uncounted likely. Every western nation done this. I'm sure daft country NATO, also complicit US military ""intimidation"" b/c also reap rewards it. Every western nations sanctions shit people. 

I think valid point toppling governments, think western nation sanctioned, colonized, uses propaganda stupid since do. Even non western nations that. People love shit US slave trade ignoring fact slave trading going Africa middle east hundreds years people actually living there. board, billionaires playing. leadership embarassment world. yeah, that'd usually sub ""true"" start get. companies love save money. like giving raise expense anymore. multiple doping violations. get multiple passports differnet Passport IDs, making relatively easy get round that.

Probably fastest way get giving receiving sex -that breathe sex Rewatched take shoes Schaub, wonder that's set hate masks take seriously Chinese culture fucking disgusting yes many good chinese, like lol joke, don‚Äôt want phone. I'd also note spooling lag covid. kill catch it; kills 2-3 weeks later. 3 weeks ago lowest point US infection rates (source: graph click US left panel).

On 9th june, lowest reported cases per day, (which 3-4 weeks ago now); previous peak reported-infection rate ~28k/day; current closer 40k/day. assume reported infection rate closer true infection rate, testing gotten better. 

Even so; previously 28k/day seeing ~3k deaths day, reason imply excess current infected start dying. comes cases per million theres lot worse places. I'm bahrain we're basically #2 world. Getting serious numbers small country. season 3 chills. Could also be, you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs difficult attribute intent. may suck now, Americans dont. ""I'd like speak Italy's manager."" - probably one Karens board work Strong Hospital. agree here.

Bluff Area Mutual Aid also great work. Yeah I‚Äôve watched way less said that. thought people would listen science reason, since many great scientists show. nope, masks gay mmkay? Mexico same! Look statistics find age breakdown covid19 cases reveals people 20s account small number cases. I'm fucking frustrated. Theres probably million posts thing, isnt handled well all. 

In singular case, I've waiting test result week now. kinda sucks even knowing not. Please take south you! clear recommend vaccine hasn‚Äôt proven safety normal rigorous testing. 

Trump controlled administrative bodies enough - looking recommendation taking jab myself. think saw complete outrage anti-shutdown protestors, BLM crowds multiple major population centers maskless outrage stopping spread, finally outrage Trump holding rally that‚Äôll start spread, finally kicked lot people selective precautionary measures reality. 

Apparently we‚Äôre going get continue play favorites towards isn‚Äôt good time mass gather maskless within 6ft less.

Stay safe! Hey dud respond chat invite please debate ksi vs jake complaining local government officials instead smug Reddit. Shouldn‚Äôt job taxpayer support people‚Äôs choice children. failed grasp point. emergency meeting late Thursday, party‚Äôs executive committee voted 40-20 move forward convention, set take place July 16-18.  committee member, Mark Ramsey, argued virtual convention would ‚Äúdisenfranchise‚Äù members party.  look people walking away screen it‚Äôs entertaining enough,‚Äù said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre disenfranchising people virtually would absolutely laser-focused in-person convention.‚Äù  many **7,000 people** possibly attendance, legislators workers already raised concerns going forward convention. really want scared, remember cases counting mostly people infected **roughly 1-2 weeks ago.** 5-10 days symptoms show, 2-5 days test results come back. 

In 1-2 weeks start tallying cases people infected *today*, there's nothing reduce number *they already infected.* Expect numbers much, much higher.

The *time take action* cases *first* started increase, could halt additional spread got control.  people denial epidemic could come back, really wanted go drink local bar get haircut.

The best thing today mask get everyone know mask up. surgeons manage wear masks multi-hour surgeries, going fine wearing one going town. Dr. Fauci says: ""We fucking fucked. Fuck."" allowed say whatever want establishment! Tell it. belong conspiracy forum since Y2k, long time now. gone completely alt right lunatic fringe wingnut Trump die since 2016. check see level of...I literally words strong enough express sentiment...assclownery?

Dude, get feel strongly right, stop looking gotchas read man There's always reason ignore something priority.

That's people can't stick budget, example. that's dev teams accrue technical debt. Could get mine connect :(
It project lol. biggest impact would also civil unrest, tens thousands deaths day lot supply chains stop working people run food. means riots looting, I'm talking looting shops I'm talking looting homes.

I've heard US already gone back panic buying, get worse cases increase. mean? Well President says it‚Äôs hoax stop testing numbers keep rising, it‚Äôs surprising. literally everyone come across bitches Masks say don‚Äôt work obsessed Trump less half states require masks. Dr. Fauci says we'll soon hit 100,000 cases per day. mom visits us frequently backyard lunch chat. enters exterior side-yard door, wears mask, sits table 15-feet us. take-out transferred plates. one ever closer 6-10 feet other. leaves, wipe surfaces alcohol. That's bald faced lie. 

I clearly stated weeks Week 45 - Week 23 years shown, *no increase mortality rates* period. 

If can't read, that's problem. 

 bald faced lie.  graph  see, Mortality Sweden extremely high still normal range.

Why talking Sweden? clearly talking Europe. 

You're clearly letting bias get better you. 

Next time, want accuse lying, get facts straight. Good, Americans need stay America get covid19 control. We'll see, Florida Texas look like deaths may started rising slightly. like huge amount deaths reported evenly across week though. hope see deaths increase drastically coming weeks, realistically think could potentially extremely bad. Rich Americans believe could still mess world always. Yeah. best can. doctor wants put someone ventilation unless really need it. would think, tests getting rarer expensive. went $100 $280 Idaho. many people going pay much unless they're already sick. literally one first come up. aware virus affects mostly old people, right? Nope everything lie everyone dying terrified you‚Äôre next Sorry, yes. table one shows what's wrong Sewer testing covers community, tell person infected. Finland made mistake, concentrating whether mask protects wearer instead hindering spread. still suggest wearing masks... Fortunately measures taken seem sufficient 1 new case today. literally using drug since day 1. steroid used reduce inflammation. used literally every case lung inflammation (eg. Asthma, COPD) inretratable shortness breath means. Hey ONE TIME bro. Never happened again.. said talk anyone see coming?

And clarify I‚Äôm referring trying imply symptoms anxiety induced. I‚Äôm genuinely confused PCPs anyone confident someone covid without testing positive, since virus wide range symptoms even see many covid patients likely every single one would different symptoms. sure covid patient looks like? Dipshits. fine them. 1822 cases breaking record set TWO DAYS AGO. 

We headed right direction. wasn‚Äôt US citizens would allowed quarantine, people plane different countries. good fuck guy parties like pong party 300 teenagers gave West Austin hear kids ""Who Gets First"" parties bets placed, futures looking pretty dim. coming decades now. heard ""Ugly American"" years--this first time spoken publicly. NFL competent, would probably possible.

There 53 players per team. Assume 4x number people need physically present play games practices. would 250 people/team 8000 people total.

Last year, NFL brought $15 billion revenue. ($15 billion)/(8000 people) almost $2 million/person.

Now recognize half revenue goes player compensation teams lose revenue stadium. looked numbers ($7 billion $6 billion). would leave league $2 billion would around $200,000/person.

For $200,000 per player person needs attend practices/games, able bubble entire resort town, give everyone free food catered best chefs world, provide free entertainment couple days every week.

That take account fact almost sure get player concessions figure way get stadium revenue boxes (I'm sure how, almost positive way) gets even easier.

You quibble individual numbers, think hard come factor 10 would need make viable...

That said, think NFL thought US government would competent enough things would least little control going season, prepare late. understand Western scientific establishment claims refute India, South Korea, Japan, Turkey many countries routinely prescribe hydroxychloroquine early treatment consistently low IFR less spread population. That's possible. Empathy taught. Likely future avoid impaired decision making currently happening. Maybe education science too? 
I understand. Feel like mask protect clerks grocery store easy smart, even clerk objects future customers protected. 
I dont give two f-s whether government suggests it. day rely politician bureaucrat health information!? would that? Koreans Chinese full hazmat suits Canadian government suggesting masks ineffective. Lol.

In Calgary even AHS bureaucrat state Chinese knows mask wearing cultural time. Sit guy. day rely politician, bureaucrat, news channel critical health information da- *dies stress induced illness. 

Going outside. Figure America. Id like visit someday soon give tourist money.üòï First thing I'd butt-arm would fan tar-like poop around like god damn hippo taking shit. making garden sprinkler noise:

What's reason? uninformed? Stupid?  Trying get it?  Nope, you‚Äôre person finds weirdly cheap. That‚Äôs there‚Äôs entire industry built around it! There‚Äôs tons people gym. work Phoenix I‚Äôve many customers come without masks tell Mountain side fitness still open worries lot gym goers 20s 30s people going night clubs pandemic spreading virus normal circumstances would good news situation give people excuse downplay virus even more: ""see, already flu even less deadly, nothing worry about"" Stay isolated yacht morons. daughter CF, Asthma, immune system deficiency. sees specialist DC respiratory considered one best US. also one figured rare form CF spent first three years life hospital every 2 4 weeks oxygen. fact, playing sports, rarity needs inhaler.

So much respect opinion.

He said everything thats OP/Articles list. also said important kids socialize immune system strength. Especially people like daughter. needs exposure common things, immune system overwhelmed something common also trying fight flu, example. Obviously shouldnt flat exposed Covid. 

I stated thinking home school. stated, obviously decision mine, schools taking precautions distance, masks, santizing nightly, etc. might safer go. virus slowing spread. Right now, would opinion.

In state (MD) considering 2 day school weeks. Half kids Mon/weds half Tues/Thurs. Online days. Seems like decent idea if, state keeps trending down. IIRC, Austrian ski resort became heavily infected responsible transmitting infection six European countries, turn came US there. could come Austria China, South Korea Iran also heavily affected February, origin confirmed. Oh great, Karen's learned fly. absolutely know. It‚Äôs remarkably simple. cowards. USA lead! (spikes football)  Government gave ferry contract ferry company ferries. Thank try. n95 mask best mask corona right? Especially given surgical mask fair - common rules apply them, news story actually do. Hell soon might start building wall keep us out.... wait...  trumps Coronavirus plan??  sneaky sneak tough completely keep citizens matter they've since right enter. put stipulations arrest quarantine. Crossing borders wild way. like momentary police state. prioritize risk differential.

That exactly done. first people get vaccine risk deal infected most, like Doctors nurses. countries really put lot effort kinda control now... states within US like New York it‚Äôs also kinda true. Yeah areas injury come risk side Covid. Lol, referring hysteria? state listened, nothing stopping people travelling across state borders. Comparing US countries enforced national lockdown, see US plateaued going ramp back up. alternative government spent lockdown prepared make things safer, creating hospitals, getting PPE factories going, updating infrastructure deal disease, contact tracing quarantine facilities.

You realize government brought hospital ships coasts? **They needed.** realize made temporary buildings overflow, right? **They needed**. realize light BLM protest stuff, technology implement legit contact tracing deemed ""unconstitutional,"" violating privacy, potentially ""racist?"" US government happily printing fake money go stock market entire time. could given actual people.

The vast majority ""fake money"" went corporations payroll protection. know, **to keep people unemployed**. notion somehow there's sinister plot make rich, richer stock market ignorant beyond words. 

Yes, money used buy bonds corporate debt cases. alternative, exactly? Let corporations fail go under? Thereby creating unemployed people? fix problem, cheese moved. People need figure new ways make money new reality.

In one sentence suggest government needs give money people help them, next saying people need figure new ways make money. Talk contradiction. it?

Why astonish us tell us EXACTLY making ends meet new financial landscape? simply reaping benefits job continues pay changing times? small business owner, entrepreneur, someone eat kill, **zero** idea talking about. Make sure, firm ""go home"". COVID dies, done, still feel surprised though. Speaking NYC, was... frustrating see millions people claim disease hoax overblown middle lockdown, 20K going 30K dead. saw run away bus coming, saw hit Italy, Spain, NY, etc..., said ""nah"" stepping way.
  
There's probably people taking distancing seriously R0 might less NY/Italy help keep hospital getting swamped (though seem trending way TX, AZ, FL). Doctors also bit experience draw from, fingers crossed mortality rates might get lower time. Still, entirely avoidable disaster. spend $200 week target. didn‚Äôt side eye you. Trump gets pay wall? I'd go docs personally. would crying you. Chin buttercup evolution thinkikng continues, would note much ""last, best chance"", **only** chance. mask wearing first thing attempted, flushing $3T toilet shutdown.

Mexico might pay it. clue. work assisted living facilities throughout country, opening back almost 0 cases. opened back saw first cases, rampant facilities.

Cases going state, we'll see goes. states like TX Fla typically pay property taxes, sometimes significantly more. yes, it‚Äôs enough fill coffers total shutdown situation Unfortunately, since said ""top doctor"", still ingrained subculture antimaskers Canada direct result can't accept change logic. CanSino one probably lead right dont manufacturing distribution necessary get many people. Also, would require trials Canada US would even look potential source, arent many cases Canada would take pass safety effectiveness trials.

If chinese citizen well connected, surprised could get CanSino vaccine early late August.  Yeah... that‚Äôs statistically relevant. Yep. takes 7-10 days know going hospital not. get window unhospitalized probably fine. think it‚Äôs ridiculous think goddamn business. part can‚Äôt get super specific on.

Thanks least putting effort. strange world live thinking Tesla bad makes panderer *evil* billionaires pedophile even majority people appearanty thinking normal rhetoric. feel point explaining anything obviously make mind up, really live Idiocracy. Lol, ""look Sweden!"" dum dums almost embarrassingly silly anti-maskers.

First off, Sweden higher death toll, economic downturn immediate neighbors imposed stricter lockdowns. get crushed, geographically speaking seems would better served temporary lockdown initially. 

Sweden culturally also much socially conscious collectivist nature compared mouth breathing rugged individualists US treat masking pandemic like deeply sinister political conspiracy. countries luxury population concerned enough fellow man willingly bare minimum keep others safe. evident case here. government issued general social distancing guidelines penalty failure comply, vast majority citizens simply followed duty country. country issued strict guidelines, people mostly complied, opened people went back old ""me-first"" lifestyles. paying price abuse personal freedoms. simple really. now... Countries ban carriers booking flights. would stop straight up. either lock let burn population like Sweden did.

Not locking means kill million people die. 

it also means high risk people locked year year half take burn population. 

Do really think choice? Still relevant point above. Days, years, cares timelines. bad vaccine bad vaccine suspect fine, especially given n95 respirator. Please try relax. Yeah OP mean, europe flubbed initially worked quickly recover. Meanwhile US sick man world keeps fucking political divide evident everyone you

Death went 25k 4 days 

Where math Americans any. Household infection rates somewhere 10% 60% depending study read, know spread really variable, people infect one, people infect dozens, article interesting analysis is. Guess need wall afterall huh I've something simular, around 10pm night one else around.  academic research hospital work absolutely consider viable treatment. study posted essentially saying young people better odds survival. Nothing drug. work assisted living facility - absolutely going work circumstances. definitely needs contact Department Health let know situation, breaking laws related infection transmission adult care facilities.

Depending live, states (like NY) mandatory sick pay two weeks cannot work due virus - includes close contact someone tested positive.

Lastly, there's way stay somewhere else friend recovers would highly advise so. test positive virus months recovery, much risk imo given job, would risk lives people cares for. understand might possible though, take many precautions (keep friend confined room, disinfect bathroom every use, limit contact much possible).

But yeah, US pass individual countries ahead soon well extent really - reasonable levels testing place peak (eg Germany) ended around 5% deaths/cases. (France, UK, Italy, Belgium) ended 15%ish.

(Can get credit now, master?) There's something quite religious statement. read De Santis? focused efforts isolate Florida's disproportionately high vulnerable group. done much reading since last statement may hold water, done. 

Though obvious enough tackle full scope risks are. 

Obviously assess governors actions regarding find imperfection disheartened, however know good fuel arguments defense another. They're usually tested longer because

a) budget constraints, parallelizing tests, navigate red tape

b) ass already fire

Nobody waits 20 years accept vaccine normal conditions either. can't test everything. F f b b butt? Lol, people predictable. next thing youre latching to? 

You didn‚Äôt get overflowing hospitals. didn‚Äôt get millions deaths. 

It must really hard always wrong.  Seriously, without common narrative leadership (politics conflicting science), people feel justified whatever justifies actions. ICU, ICU, baby... surprised heard certain countries going start allowing us Brits enter countries without imposing mandatory 2 week quarantine. Don‚Äôt get wrong though, UK WAY better America almost like understand everyone wore masks, therefore potentially exhaling deadly virus everything, people would stay home.

Society could get lot back normal we've been. Businesses could reopen, people could get lives get back work. people sensible idiotic

Gonna honest. sentence ass backwards. Even consider average intelligence. people average intelligence less otherwise. We're completely outnumbered. 

Also reddit small community comparatively. Everywhere look outside see ppl wearing masks way reflects people's attitude platform.

I wholly disagree statement. Judging replies, definitely student. would advice take advanced science courses working understanding inner workings cell first try rank vaccines. 

Good luck Good. Yes. wish done much earlier. conclusion kind obvious leaders needed spelled out. Pneumonia inflammatory condition lung. Caused usually bacteria Haemophilus influenzae. viral pneumonia also I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre referring COVID pneumonia pneumonia caused virus.

1. sample size 1900 pretty robust typical types studies. 
2. median age similar COVID flu groups. authors even made sure adjust age, sex, race, likelihood stroke higher COVID-19 infection. 
3. JAMA, internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journal, probably print sensationalized article written ""Just couple students trying get name published"". original authors also doctors practice Cornell Medicine FYI. 

I suggest actually read article think posting type uninformed content. I'm Placer vouch this. drove Sunsplash Roseville today people great distancing line. residents really dgaf unknown percentage otherwise ‚Äúasymptotics‚Äù show ground-glass opacity lungs.

In one study, ""unknown percentage"" like 97-100%? also aligns ""happy hypoxia"" symptoms see lot people, even feel fine still might poorly. Overall, point likelihood unknown percentage quite high. It‚Äôs holiday weekend probably fucked least another days. applied gas stations call centers disappointed worked hard get degree try sell people things don‚Äôt want/ can‚Äôt afford phone terrible at!

Not sure Brazil. example, site encountering supply issues certain type glass bottle. Putting potentially billions revenue risk.

That‚Äôs difficult get things done. Big brain shit right there. Burr brilliant comedian that's got interview Rogan saying stupid shit Burr putting place.

Hmm let check math real quick... let's see, carry 3, forgot minus sign, okay go: DUH Florida counties require masks. one enforcing step forward guess Chartering flights often expensive people think, especially current climate.

I exactly trust dating advice. come back clarify make sure hospitals could prepare surges?

So problem drafting passing legislation regarding face masks? yeah, schools reopen teacher there.... get virus. see way happen. thinking good idea redditt kind rained - toilets everyone different ""free"" concerts park etc port-a-potty wait till go home. 14 day quarantine actually enforced?

That question illustrates much trouble US. Enforcement required people follow rules. ""These rules."" ""Okay."" bummer I‚Äôm pretty sure Corona 0... rules rarely apply states refreshing see get owned. possible vaccine months.

However, very, unlikely. virus fucking care believe. that's twist can't unemployed dead. Brazilian national positive test rate 50%. done 3 million tests total get 1.5 million cases.

Arizona positive test rate 24% worst affected US state (US national 8%).

Brazil worse people think argued doesn‚Äôt like masks make look less manly. forget exactly phrased recent episode Bill Burr guest Bill kinda went insecure. later backpedalled saying said get rise Bill previously made comments masks seems like he‚Äôs saying backlash. mean like would gone anyway. kinda crazy rest world treating us like we're developing country. Usually us banning countries traveling here, way around. Great job Trump.  Thank service. know one person saying thanks make things better, us care. ""He all-star season based calculations."" Never said weren't. repeatedly referred update existing rules. Protests also set precedent lockdown/quarentine taken seriously anymore. That's honestly much bigger effect protest crowds themselves. People attitude people last month follow rules I? I'm anything stupid protests made take whole thing little bit less seriously. thousands people got careless last month try extra hard make it? Partially opinion also millions others try debate reasoning much make much difference even change mind. OH TURNTABLES   testing sick people, USA testing anyone wants one. European: fuck there? That's strange... since monitor blood oxygen levels painless way. use pulseoximeter. get stand alone devices use home less $30.

Drawing arterial blood check done japanese guy invented pulseoximeter back 70s. Uh, no? earth trying straight lie?

For example, brainier, option 2 Arizona close 5,000 cases today. remember unbelievable country, let alone single state notification requires bluetooth enabled participating app installed. 

The tracking however, appears default option changing it. I'd like speak MANAGER! yeah thats point working whole time SIP orders seem like way protect upper class people work home sacrificing poor people still forced go work I‚Äôm still eating stuff bought. Currently spending 1/4 ever spent kn groceries, I‚Äôve never eaten much rice, beans chickpeas life good. Maybe read wrong one phase trial? Yeah well fuck reason believe kids transmit disease. Somehow schools opened result problems EU.  sure magical age though issues start (high school? University?). Church bad mental physical health Meh. Big headlines, fall apart scientific scrutiny 3, 2, 1...

Why politicized beyond me. covidica saw someone online day claimed we'd flattened curve southeast. people live reality claimed study controlled experiment. 

The links study thing. gold standard testing best falsely raising peoples hopes making unjustified claims. hey looking unload stock bought whatever. schengen, least precovid little (IIRC zero) passport checking France, Switzerland, Italy. crossed borders least dozen times ferry, train, car wasnt checked (and ferry/train tickets across borders require passport scan purchase). Lockdown wasted, overwhelmed hospitals, anti-maskers.

We screwed up. guy claims he‚Äôs basing everything statistics doesn‚Äôt know don‚Äôt get better three days, apparently. hope hits hard enough eat crow idiots followed example wake up. Obviously thick two short planks then, probably mentally ill boot. literally arguing fictional person mind. solid science comment though innit government could set tone differently different first impression outbreak started.

When potus saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs dem hoax‚Äù ‚Äúliberate‚Äù topped making CDC say masks face coverings don‚Äôt work even head CDC telling people don‚Äôt wear masks anti mask propaganda.

Florida wants purge old people. people think unconstitutional believe ""my body, choice"". stupid reasoning. saw article somewhere went detail why. Let see find it. Oh wait, article commenting on. reals?!?! Still better redirecting zones big hospitals. country, risk group, get flu shot home(which awesome, wonderful move government demand big providers) but... rest redirected hospitals, people panicked many people wanted get vaccinated. supply private providers limited. couldn‚Äôt get appointment either. It‚Äôs still better it‚Äôs 75-100 (still quite lot) 500-700 building. Yes, bars (and indoor restaurants) bad than, say, allowing people eat drink public park. 

What least consider trying relaxing rules regulations allow business activity outside (with masks), making indoor business activity either brief (take-out) prohibited. 

Otherwise, thing offering shutdowns economic losses. That's hard argument make. Americans dont that, right? too. March cancelled said, youre gonna closed soon. person cancelled like, nah, think we‚Äôll good. Gym literally closed next day. Urging requiring? Big difference. Yes forgetting, that's problem done lied mask use - saying protects others, instead going details protecting person. foregone details people would wearing masks everywhere.....

Of people participated study, 91 percent never hospitalized corona, 43 percent diagnosed doctor. ‚ÄúIt first time large patient group portrayed. people really need seen, heard helped, '' says Rutgers. ""We must prevent invisible group patients ending ship corona.""

The average age study participants 53 years. far largest group (85 percent) say health good corona infection; 6 percent still experience way. Almost half indicate unable exercise corona.

Unless it‚Äôs investments. nothing exponential growth.

For real? Okay, know exponential growth actually means. Got it. said hours ago. 

Muting now.   3.7.15?  majority UA students state reminding everyone USA currently showing lowest daily Covid deaths since March.

The deaths falling past month, continue downward idea South Dakota isnt NYC. standardized lockdown answer states areas spread populations lockdown would far harm good.

There federal guidance sure, $70 billion budget vaccines testing since spending shitload already ineffective stimulus. states ones determine extent lockdown implemented, seeing experiencing economic costs measured billions due lockdown. Remember, coronavirus damaging economic loss also affects livelihood. diminishing returns lockdown lockdowns meet exceed economic costs virus infecting people non-locked economy.

In lieu states, least needs apolitical metric(s) severity lockdown policies implemented. r0 falls 1 rural low population density state simply isnt need total lockdown. Masks, social distancing, sure. closed stores people unable return work despite kind compromise? bullshit safetyism scientism spitting face actual risk assessment. Governor DeSantis finally going number 1 something despite inability make meaningful decisions. Great job Ron! DeSantis look happy pic.

Good.  think keeps real tbh Please don‚Äôt try logical dark love 1,162 cases Texas, Abbott would reopen bars. Florida next please Live Milwaukee get tons Chicago people eat dinner. Go home!!! intent

It wasn‚Äôt malicious. said wanted dissuade public buying masks felt important health care officials shortage. felt like right thing. maybe right call. end, didn‚Äôt trust public enough shoot straight, public isn‚Äôt completely trusting them.

Also conservatives: bill gates trying microchip nice then, got it. sounds possible. isn't. fact matter may delay effective treatments vaccines. sample pool gets small, that's way works. So, no, lockdown like countries. actual enforcement. Wear mask get doctor's note. note, utilize ""compromised individual"" shopping hours. note, shut wear mask. mask, entry, anywhere. Period. leave businesses decide. Enforce it. Slap orders place every business needs everything power necessitate pickup delivery involve people entering physical building. Lower damn occupancy limits businesses. local Walmart occupancy limit 880. That's 1/3 entire residency city in. Lower shit. absurd. Close modify businesses. Outside service restaurants only, outside service salons. People happy cut hair outside state capitol steps protest, make thing. Close severely limit entertainment venues. Wearing masks cleaning hands biggest thing. Also ban people bringing items public spaces.

If pay daily, fixed calendar period get paid, yes choose longer pay period, rather short one. means choose January instead April, well means April February. 

But nothing exponential growth.

In fact income structures expect payment continually months. January versus February question red herring. 

In fact, entire thought experiment purely hypothetical, real payment structures work irrelevant. _BUT QUESTION MONTH IN_

Oh boi, lemme get popcorn üôÉ appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* taking account Florida's elderly population large live nursing homes.

They live sprawling retirement communities taken guidance seriously.

It's going bad, man. patients lay stomachs significantly reduced deaths. Treating steroids significantly reduced deaths. follow treatment guidlines April. course deaths go find new tricks treat it.

Social distancing mask usage also contributing reduced viral load patients. 

There evidence strains virus, around world, decided simulatnuosly mutate less deadly.

I know everyone wants believe mutated less dangerous now, absolutely evidence that. We've seen mutate spread easily, less deadly. guy crack ?? Although doubt are, news stories see intentionally try make seem crowded are. use long telephoto lens compress depth field make everyone look closer together.

People outside beach generally preferable inside anywhere house. Listen I‚Äôm worshipping Cuomo handled NYC. Interstate travel wouldn‚Äôt caused outbreak extent could states also restrictions populations. 

Even tristate citizens planted seed, packed bars/restaurants/beaches public spaces watered plant. failure peel back free enabled probably blame exponential growth we‚Äôre seeing. 

Also New Yorkers exactly epitome health either.

Edit: it‚Äôs also Cuomos fault interstate travel allowed. doesn‚Äôt authority ban that. large portion puzzle missing Florida needs tourist dollars. Almost Florida income comes tourists. main reason shut probably costs. think Florida (the government) freaking broke Florida (the people) scared want stay inside. really sucks Florida 10k sick day government officials sticking head sand. oompa loompas real would totally serve song-and-dance burn lifetime. smart little bastards, watching tv eating junk food.  get riled every time see someone call trump oompa loompa, sorry. Yeah, much early make decision. Lol trust got deleted/removed showing. thanks keeping reddit spirit trying invoke anger others üòâ real winner buddy. Would like pat back now? duty day!  Yeah it‚Äôs incredibly naive think sports save us. literally held captive moronic part population refuses think critically actions. delayed indefinitely indoor restaurant seating city excited hear afraid going go ahead anyway fucking absurd death count pandemic reasonableness political issues... are. C'mon, else supposed make clear actually care one iota public safety? get patient privacy court would need show proof medical condition need state it? NYC track? would make sense spread rural NY things move slowly welcome Canada. bad apples general pretty sensible people. think Obama would also worn mask led example. found someone covid-19, selfishly goes public outings parties...they go jail.  Walk grocery store, find one two people bare minimum without masks. I'd say first offence warning (and return within days follow up). 2nd offence, see ya, gonna open prime real estate law abiding business owners.

I mean, customers may take masks inside, least someone door making sure everyone mask enter..  Oh really??? think beach visitors state too. number certainly doubled/tripled. people Navarre Navarre Beach wearing masks!! see everywhere disturbing. Needless say....MANY IGNORANT supporters still love flying Confederate flag front house trucks. could bad hombre climbing bedroom husband away. case give even odds US death rate per capita exceeds UK‚Äôs end 2020. going say that, except ill dog. Yep. Chicken costco due hoarding outbreaks meat plants state governments longer announcing. firefighters fight wildfires california largely prisoners-- prison quarantined right outbreak. Looking forward large parts west coast burning learning live virus means firefighters burning season. exactly it. They‚Äôve effectively put artificial maximum daily case load due subpar testing capacity. get many positives, loooot fests needed. Idk positive/overall test ratio is. assuming 0.25, 200-400k tests needed people supportive measures bring virus rate down, even lost jobs businesses. Yes hear vocal minority (and plenty astroturfing foreign interference) need ""open economy"" right away represent majority Americans. gets lot attention people want spread disease. nature human beings. every packed bar, every Jayden Bill says ""if get Covid, get Covid"" there's 20 Karens Davids like ""damn, I'm going anywhere year."" 

I'm tired officials top pretending country really divided this. Yes, divided, like 80/20. 50/50. possible originate China wet market research facility coincidence. people always point Sweden‚Äôs response forget point healthcare system.

We cannot follow method due terrible healthcare system. keep R 1, situation end. sacrifice nothing. sure Cuomo understands not. we‚Äôll switch focusing lower, lagging number hospitalizations tell us happening. end, look excess deaths normal.  good situation. It‚Äôs funny cause recently moved back Texas Minnesota. Moved back think Minnesotans rudest 6 states I‚Äôve lived in. 

I think Texas leadership awful it‚Äôs hot mess, Minnesota definitely handled better. 

But never say southern hospitality isn‚Äôt real. Florida git? could private company sell vaccine protects vaccinations (which ends vaccine) 50.0 minute delay fetching comments.

Beautiful description sound haha  kind wonder symptoms typed it.  

People are.....*coughhhhh....coughhh* fed ...*hackzzzz...coughhhh* ....up.  failing *back* penalties, told cities countries *couldn't* impose punishments state wasn't. Might wanna tell future coworkers it, may get jealous There's definite error Table 1 - median lower 25% figure IQR. Swapping would make median less outlier, results significant. could great job, won‚Äôt matter 20 percent people state think it‚Äôs made-up pandemic. that's NY still give shit like 75% country. kind mental health problems think develop watch teachers die?

...that way get rid religious ppl. clear, post celebrating unilateral authoritarian action state. 

These powers seized state going like ""other guys"" turn office. rest country locked time NYC did, might chance level control

New York never locked down. New Yorkers literally seeded rest country. European-type ""lockdown"" means can't leave city go ""quarantine"" Los Angeles Miami. New York ""lockdown"" -- stay-at-home order small number businesses closed. New Yorkers could literally hop subway travel anywhere wanted USA. That's opposite  Damn article sobering. soooo F'd right US. Ya.. sad really. co-worker that's aggressively defying recommendations suppressing pandemic believe it. tries hit propaganda (via text company communication channel, he's remote) I'm like ya that's bad idea. He's really mad vacation Red River, NM might get interrupted NM might start mandatory 14 day quarantines state visitors. I'm like yup... that's good thing believe not.

Edit: We're actually clinical support tried brag going clinics without masks (company requirement) thinks they're stupid. like ""you're days numbered... start looking new job."" ... I've seen people get fired wearing masks get flu shot. Grimes needs take baby R2-D2 get fuck away Musk. mom bought 40 tickets high school brought crashed car school, special effects makeup put middle 2nd-period class, wore rest day.

Everything fine guys...üòÖüòÖüòÖ First make protesters rioters social distance masks rest follow. Wait, portion populace exact opposite whatever scientist advise? 

omg elitist tell shit foot!! Yikes boys im gonna head liqour store get smashed. Fuckkkk Really dying hill huh?

Its ok admit incorrect get new data Looks like plaquenil back menu boys!  oh lol gotcha Better late never. Yeah sucks least wakes referring Sweden whole versus us whole. us whole similar pet capita Sweden, would 177k deaths.  polls Oh, totally get it. read 3 thought kids (and much younger little brother) way. brother taught lot patience growing lol. ""A crude estimate British Medical Journal suggests 1 10 people contract coronavirus sustain significant symptoms three months illness, left uncertainty whether regain previous level function [2]. Evidence mounting suggest many endure years major burden healthcare expenditures.""

Which confronted novel virus wise treat unknown is, instead insisting flu. I‚Äôve never understood people thinking guns going protect ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù manner laid 2nd amendment. people really believe they‚Äôd able make stand ‚Äútyrannical government‚Äù full might U.S. military disposal? ""What happened 80% people even knowing it?""

Here's quote *you* asked, yet again. literally we're discussing *you* one brought up.

Don't make excuses can't back position. Either re-evaluate believe, share compelling data read form opinions. Otherwise wasting time putting others lives risk. reprehensible obtuse lives stake. Grow up. better.  I‚Äôm sure changed. begged tell changed perspective. kept resorting back ‚ÄúFauci bad‚Äù ‚Äúnumbers show virus isn‚Äôt harmful,‚Äù etc. It‚Äôs surprise repeating words almost verbatim heard Fox News recently. I‚Äôm sure Ur halting protesters would u it? heading dark time USA. first video overflowing hospital Texas Florida going cause massive panic, blink eye videos overflowing hospitals 10 different cities, major hospital systems 10 states going start transitioning parkinglot triage time. said everyday cases stayed 30k. 

1000 percent s/ I‚Äôm following, mind enlightening me? ~70k deaths weekly NYCs peak, ~50k weekly that‚Äôs somehow proof covid deaths now? numbers grotesquely distorted including 65 84 single cohort. That‚Äôs going heavily weighted high end range, judging adjacent 85+ category.

As public service get people take disease seriously, get it, 20 year wide cohort matter science? Suspect. Well one obvious difference would population density. New York way densely populated else equal expect heavily populated area cases. 

Higher deaths could due policy New York forcing nursing homes take recovering COVID patients. likely seeded outbreaks among vulnerable population. Guys please stop testing making look bad Ok many deaths? That's matters right? narrative change? believe said they're planning ramp Texas soon. Denton County sheriff refusing remember 15 cases said we'd go zero. would thought meant 2.8 million. Texans, wear mask name self-defense would gun name self-defense. principle. mask defends life, others lives, businesses, key reopening things saving lives. sad anyone accepts this, I'm sure hear often others soon serious. Wtf guys there. Really fucking everything up. Don‚Äôt worry. DeSantis let play Florida. covid merrier would awesome! love drive theaters. I've missed going movies lot. movies out? HELL YEAH TIRED WINNING?  hospitals reporting surges.

CNN (fuck going say fake news) put video today San Antonio hospital crushed are. look bad footage saw New York height, *bad.* Odds get worse symptoms tend lag actually getting it. not. new 100,000 cases day next week? Yes. testing keep actually catch many positives? Probably not. Yeah let‚Äôs ignore post viral Kawasaki syndrome fact kids pass disease adults.  I'm Saint Joseph processing plant found ~500 infected (out 2500 workers). 3 cases showed symptoms ridiculously high number found site wide testing following Trump making processing plants indispensable. 

The crazy thing prior less 100 people identified entire town ~80k. know they'd actually tested entire town infection rate percentage would've blown roof. crazy stuff. technically 40% + 10% ‚Äú independent ‚Äú Kind curious see left world happens. nihilist tendency me.

Yes, number new cases going rise rise rise vaccine. funniest shit claims ""calls sees it"" he's biased talk show host ever heard. makes rush look like liberal comparison. Agreed. 

Anything said hundred percent certainly covid right going accurately portraying actually known correct amount uncertainty findings. 

At best, could say people started studying December January, first data illness available. short amount time major research study, gets way complicated fields like medicine. 

And study specifically referencing deaths happened MARCH. 

Studies give qualified statements (such using ‚Äúmay‚Äù) published respected BEST stage game. Researchers working years data, would typically considered expected amount time analyze data look methodological loop holes. 

It rushed (deliberately without careful thought, mind, correct approach) precisely science slow people DYING. 

Is best science ? NO. one claiming exactly qualifiers used. best science right now? YES. get happen lucky minority gets severe consequences, OK staying home right? give someone like ICU slot needed it?

Because that's exactly problem stance. overwhelm system. tried ""hope people right thing own"" route failed miserably. It‚Äôs him. It‚Äôs disheartening many friends, family neighbors decided wearing mask hill die on. people bent backwards muck other‚Äôs disgusting ruined homes Harvey. can‚Äôt believe people. I‚Äôm ashamed state city ugly selfish hateful people it. wear mask order, wear mask properly order, right? Lollll  You‚Äôre totally right. moved Chicago North Carolina everyone billion times nicer. rednecks, religious people social circles... it‚Äôs great.

My grade you: F  Even though grades completely determined random teachers? Teachers could simply give everyone As, yet mean students prepared college. Tests scored standardized way; grades not. Wow info BARDA whistleblower ‚Äúdarkest winter‚Äù? honestly missed entire story would love catch it. Welcome age 30! ...The older get, less friends make, people already believe friends need. RIP age. Lmao ..at point..Good!.. can‚Äôt wait till July 4th. It‚Äôll even worse.lol still flock together like wild animals Morons killed thousands Americans, name licking Presidents rancid ballsack Isn‚Äôt supposed CDC? would possibly able administer early enough damned thing don‚Äôt prioritize testing enough find you‚Äôre positive time? Florida flattening curve Florida way possible. governor Mexican border state Tamaulipas said Thursday tested positive COVID-19, becoming fourth state leader country infected new coronavirus. comes that. keep mind. Thank you! Guys, going? allergies. one denying want see less deaths, early celebrating early.

I remember Governor Florida made fun folks criticized going see surge 2-weeks opening never came--until 2 months passed are. I'll sum argument:

Me like numbers, dey Bad! Bad numbers! Test dey false test, test false! See numbers bad!

It's idiot trying minimize states objectively terrible numbers, claiming there's lots false negatives. another numbers overinflated nutter, happens congressman. Yeah that‚Äôs guy think! time someone calls disagrees gets abrasive sexual tension Jared Kelly erupts, pence mother buy house boat lake havasu. Good episode Lack education I‚Äôm baffled ignorant people really be.

The real problem - America, large chunks anyway, never fundamental beliefs challenged reality serious way. matter believe things seem okay, change?

So large parts country slowly slipped insane delusions world really works. live fantasy world, full stop.

Nothing change fossilized nonsense short massive kick teeth. unfortunate. Even so, ended fucking doesn‚Äôt change shit American response was. *clapclapclapclap*

Deep heart Texas!


I‚Äôll show out... literally said month ago. Im tired DOOM DOOM DOOM want stats %s data. shit since October. It‚Äôs like trying tell child they‚Äôre wrong, keep insisting they‚Äôre right. ever warned this! Cant either dead someone that's currently teaching 3 year old, curious too. googling found books reading levels find online. get ballpark know depth tests schools do. know he's conscious communicating verbally, seen anything prospects far cognitive recovery goes. Saying manages survive recovers enough return semi-independent life this, dude's gonna wicked psychological trauma this. guy's body beyond failing thinking amount invasive procedures things medical staff manually try get body hold together long terrifying. entire state meth one straw. common named moms also say precious children wear masks school. Government comes massive cash injections keep running, much like happening countries. Lead balloon Thank Florida Florida things. support this, living one hotspot counties WA. Problem is, there's many frick knuckles drinking ""MaSkS r DuMb"" koolaid. gets worse least half anti-maskers believe medical malady befall mask up... California. states decide wildly different containment measures fafil. think agreed level aligned lockdown maybe national guideline severe lockdowns need depending population densities case counts, perhaps could've achieved something. [How stupid feel right Yeah that's really messed context, US reported 22,287 cases 2 June. I‚Äôd likely said something similar neighbor wife did. Meanwhile, inside head I‚Äôd screaming, ‚ÄúWhat FUCK THINKING?!?‚Äù Besides that's pneumonia COVID. There's proof gotten pneumonia anyway. government paying doctors diagnose everything COVID that's reason saying ""recovered"" covid.

Whatabout asthma? see handwringing asthma almost 4,000 people year. Whatabout flu? people protesting flu? hype big nothingburder...

/s sadly Also deaths get counted positive covid test confirmed. Lots deaths days counted towards covid Oh baby go They're trying Sweden model.

Nevermind work Sweden, Florida *different*

/s Hopes prayers! lazy.

There's plenty testing available major hospitals. many people randomly testing. know thinking I'm saying. I'm pointing Gottlieb's admission situation 1) control, 2) going continue control January, 3) cost hundreds thousands people lives.

Whatever actual words, message. They're admitting failure, offering nothing except hope things get better January. 

This criminal dereliction duty. Great! really need cancel 2020! Hard call earth round hoax. true girls call minnie-mouse naked ? slightly 10% increase per day...  one's easy, medical exemptions. Wear mask gtfo. smart death count low cases TIME HIGH like throwing party half time Superbowl. celebration bit pre-mature. might lead, team carrying   momentum.

Florida median positive case age TIME LOW around age 35, even median population age Florida 42.

Seminole County 16 deaths 2,202 cases.

Sumter County 17 deaths 317 cases.

Difference median age Sumter resident around 67, Seminole resident 38, covid19 positives Seminole reportedly median age 26 two weeks ago.

The football analogy creative, though maybe disturbing, team rooting death (?) dependent older ""players"", stats suggest younger team increased momentum. What? According Worldometer it‚Äôs 8%. welcome find ONE influential ""liberal"" minimizing pandemic telling people wear masks. one side political spectrum telling people that. Sounds like triggered nothing visited Arizona week. Notice first thing addresses great economy. Corona, saying great state leaders done &amp; doing. brought 62 extra health care workers along &amp; claimed send 500 more. Nothing see here. Great leadership! 

 wow genius edited comment twice make double smart. Truly mind others. Nice, close unemployment levels worst part worst recession we‚Äôve ever had. People responding ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel bad‚Äù people holding house party, that‚Äôs justification shot? Sad news. problem many airbnb homes residential areas full time residents already annoyed constantly changing visitors tend respect neighborhood quiet night.

Where live, municipalities already passed regulations specifically targeted reduce Airbnb rentals. ""going herd immunity"" strategy, failure (and millions deaths disabilities).  worry. disappear Easter. approach succeeded. Thursday, officials said eight people received subpoenas contacted county Health Department cooperating tracing efforts. additional virus cases confirmed result, officials said.

We need use approach people refuse wear mask. guarantee mask wearing would longer issue. No, given US massive country correct approach. Texas alone big germany, Uk france combined...

The done country (germany) btw, problem US governors absolutely fucked up.

They need Cuomo, turn 180 get real asap. serious mental problems.

There law pa saying can't wear medical mask carry weapon.

You're either paid post idiocy, stupid simply believe whatever told. They‚Äôre manufacturing test case trials go well Well, learn one thing: ""Avoid like plague"" clearly accurate idiom, least places. Lol you‚Äôre nuts. Given know incubation periods stuff could potentially quarantine less. depends hard lock down. Technically lockdown still place CA, meaningless weekends public places packed before. weld everyone shut homes drone delivery food could probably squash virus within 3-4 weeks tops, doubt that's something everyone's willing do.

Either way think locked harder really beat virus. half-assed lockdown needs extended forever meaningless. See tomorrow record breaking headline. Really sad!  reason wonder drug held back ""political science"" community media think ""TRUMP DRUG""  stuff lives cat.

Lets see sort cardiac issues disqualify trial.

The irregular heart rhythms known WH ~~bought stock~~... thought good idea. believe still going

I dont think China 200,000+ new cases day, think even China 200k cases, would make USA Brazil look better ---- would make China look worse impact view USA handling Covid. agree. friend lives Queens said everyone around pretty much ‚Äòdone‚Äô pandemic May. going parties taking plane tripes since then. becoming new REEEEEEEEEEE. cringey first job two hardest without network contacts get past HR filters. years, degree matters lot less (but might impact fast pay goes up).

Get better, Nick Cordero God bless family. love side!  I‚Äôm still confused: businesses *allowed to* turn people away (which anyway)? *required* to?   fair, suspect catching much higher percent cases NY lockdown. People NYC explicitly told come get tested, go doctor unless felt like going die. people getting positives today going hospital droves, least yet. Sad true assessment. Living depressing. holy shit really joke could go teach English Indonesia Brazil.

Several major hotspot countries showing time records daily new cases, US, India, South Africa, almost Brazil (2nd highest daily record) Finally good news. Death rate still way lower peak. ideas second wave less virulent. calculations, rate transmission change, Texas reach hospital capacity 20 days, surge cap 30 days. Arizona reach hospital cap 27 days, surge cap 42 days. Florida doesn‚Äôt release hospital data probably similar timeline. suspect rate transmission start drop people get cautious states. probably take little longer propose above. 

I‚Äôm assuming 1 covid patient per 1000 population hospital cap 2 per 1000 surge cap, based California hospital capacity data wrong country? seems gone mad. anti-record? English degrees also excellent qualification working Amazon Walmart. illegal?

Instead getting defensive, think. Assume positive intent. Yeah don‚Äôt get theory. New York State population Sweden, several times number deaths, absolute population-adjusted.

He‚Äôs current administration. used be, he‚Äôs trying get people take seriously. Hence strong words. Yeah, US 50,000+ that.... 50k cases today. Definitely slowing rich people still don‚Äôt wear masks.  Sure, far evidence immunity last long opposite. Anyone claiming herd immunity possible without vaccine anyway burden proof side. Hand shovels. Problem solved almost learned ration toilet paper... Um, 2% 100,000 2,000 people. Even happens infection across entire population risk groups years old, compromised health) much higher percentage. risk groups play safer, lower mortality rate. Even better everyone plays safer (with extra steps risk) we'll lower mortality. 

But US, expect nonsense. far air travel cabin filtered? America Brazil literally account half that, even trying countries? I'm sure ACT, SAT literally give every equation necessary first page test. purely critical thinking nothing remembering answers.

What dumbass test take? know hcq zinc work? non believer till read article combination. taking get sick stops virus able multiply fast apparently. Don‚Äôt quote though. Brutal. American leadership failed us. many, many people need resign right now. jail time I‚Äôm glad hear that. We‚Äôre small rural town one seems care. Yep. classy scenario wound even awesome. :) Wont happen. Gov ron deathsentence stupider Abbott dreading getting brain poked, hopefully test specific sensitive enough useful! matter, people afraid virus before, likely they'll afraid take heed words scientists. Brazil Russia leaders terms Covid-19 incidence. 889 new cases¬†have observed Ukraine¬†over last 24 hours. Well well well Florida finally leading something. DeSantis blaming media increase. day blaming test dump increased testing. Haha surprised DC Virginia. Wherever Gaylord Maryland extremely nice Nice. enjoyed bourbon little much. 

Now need time focus back. Surviving pandemic going long game. Florida even appearance penis left hanging North America's pants. Rubio said ‚Äúonly‚Äù 5% people get die. Even though number high, seems OK it. 

When politicians say shit like that, journalists show politician question list 20 40 his/her family members ask him/her ones die.

And they'll still think safe, course. seem unable understand might well die shit. majority, yeah, sigh. yeah already know two people job it. ugh. Thank writing Whats wrong Norwegian? study shows young people likely recover Covid even take HQC old people.

It show, all, taking HQC helps recover Covid. 

It piece crap review. Exactly happened wife's family Pakistan 2 weeks ago. uncle likely heat stroke. called ambulance told would hour. make it.

First aid training teaches golden hour. get medical help within hour MUCH likely make it. reminds people caption dogs thoughts YouTube videos. fill health care directive, it‚Äôs sobering review. Also, everyone I‚Äôve never even heard now? opposite 'collectivism' individualism, selfishness. pool testing even effective point? damn widespread feel like almost every batch testing positive... Quit complaining keep shoveling! lifelong Ohioan, disappointment immeasurable. even ""bubble"". said venue hotel staff allowed out. Literally defeats purpose.  I'm denying anything doesnt make sense compare apples oranges Well, gotta give credit grain salt. county lockdown. husband part. didn‚Äôt try cheat lockdown rules. Many neighbors gathered every weekend talk &amp; play. friends family visit visit saw friends. people know here, don‚Äôt actually know one household near us truly followed spirit lockdown. Going five grocery stores day spirit lockdown dinner parties. know people households followed lockdown, always someone family ‚Äúcheated.‚Äù 

Until everyone actually cares community (and friends family) themselves, we‚Äôre screwed. can‚Äôt stop without us working together. Media honest spinning things would also help. People need wear masks stop gathering crowds. 

America always stood freedom. Now? feels like we‚Äôre nation riddled narcissism. 
I‚Äôm ashamed country right sad.

*Edited fix verb tense. Uhm mean ever control pandemic all. can't lose control first place illuminating, it, politics influence human psyche? start counting number people died couldn‚Äôt afford get medical care? Either cost care cost missing work. know plenty people pop Advil everyday try ride ever‚Äòs bothering them; surely people done relatively minor conditions turned deadly left untreated? pre-existing conditions? I'm genuinely curious dont know pool testing Birx, pool testing takes samples small group people -- typically five 10 people -- tested coronavirus together combined sample comes back negative COVID-19, entire group combined sample comes back positive, health officials would use contact tracing test individual. bet live state agree you. It‚Äôs bad idea send back. alarming median falls outside IQR, Table 1 seems bugged whichever way look it.

Never mind commas legend line data either, aiding confusion.

Guess peer review process important, completed yet, right? Trump sucks post stupid.  think death toll would zero Obama? flu, bro. people die it. besides young people getting now. fend themselves. probably making much money yet, useless terms tax revenue. 

sorry floridaman, dead. trickle truthing fact fall sports happening Czechia decided pandemic everyone held 1000-person outdoor party one bridge Prague masks anyone. behavior limited US places government sanctioned. Probably reading. Probably watching Faux TV We'll see goes. state mandating masks week now, really reinforced people still whatever want, much like drinking age 21. measures would worked month ago maybe. we've got exponential growth full blown lock fix even take 3 6 weeks cases get manageable levels Oh man, one hoot.

Conclusion study:

Being young makes less likely die Covid, even take HQC. actual message actually concluded.

Also, another massive problem. people died real life HQC side effects somehow longer exist data? Texan here. I'm sad definitely describe paradise moment. many actually sick? Would nice additional statistic They're one organizations left union representation .....this year. US bought pretty much world supply it. Exactly. hard think trust experts could get lower, whole bunch experts decide tell stupid obvious lie public middle public health crisis? stupid, could preserved much credibility honest. cases world activities environmental parameters risk factors. cringe compounds US also behind research post-COVID side effects, numbers worrisome thing.

Close 1.4M recovered roughly 10% could lingering issues looked into.

I mean fear mongering saying know, might wrong‚Ä¶ I'm Texan Y'all wanna know many friends families planning backyard pool parties BBQs?

Fuckin em. near &amp; Out? One other. Chinese aren‚Äôt stupid. release Covid-19 effected much every part world. needs logical basis conspiracy theory possible. 1300 deaths one day lowest? That's false. Also say 1,000 deaths per day July, that's 160,000 deaths August first nearly 200,000 early Sept. that's death decline, hell worth?  China anything but, bouncing 1 self created PR nightmare another since shit started. Looks like deaths rose back 700 today according Wapo like price admission parent right difficult, really can't stand people criticizing either decision parent make fall, especially kids. Every families situation unique they're article literally says that's bullshit. spreading misinformation.

Edit: article says ""someone preexisting conditions COULD experience hypoxia."" That's N95 mask though. surgical masks. say people becoming sick. Wear fucking mask quit bitching like whiney self entitled fuck. literally saves lives. school work at. Gotta get new students dorms get housing payments! country billion people 5 new cases? Maybe \[population\] math way base, sounds like absolute lie me. understand Trump, America first. married cop youre 2-4 times likely beaten abused wondering still think wearing masks won‚Äôt help... really haha, I'm Shenzhen really nice here. Yeah need summon army naked miners ... problem solved! quite strict. 

Did hop car go see parents? so, strict lockdown. recent study showing conspiracy minded folks likely take precautions...until govt official recommended put remove water via endotracheal tracheostomy tube itself. 

A tracheostomy remove airway reflexes. Try stick suction catheter someone's tracheostomy, I'll guarantee end (hopefully masked) face full lung secretions.  due respect... no. evidence 'WEARING MASK WOULD AVOIDED THIS!""

Numerous people wore damned masks showing hospitals Texas, Alabama, Florida.

They shut damned homes, exposed one, still getting CoVid somehow.

Ur-Example: one cousin Florida. Locked apartment past month, gone home month, groceries delivered.

Started feeling sick, went doctor's office putting mask... tested positive CoVid.

This stuff spread somehow direct person-to-person.

Now, mask reasonable going outside? Yes... try make seem like panacea. people said. There‚Äôs gonna enough push back already. fact remains cases gonna keep going weeks, 2 weeks we‚Äôre seeing 15k cases per day? Say yeah mask order start working? We‚Äôre gonna lock down. Stop putting Hilarious. throwaways lol ""Dr"". Anthony retarded think first wave ever ended. idiots even gotten close start second wave, honestly even think first wave end anytime soon. usually don‚Äôt entertain single article hasn‚Äôt peer-reviewed, are.

The point I‚Äôm getting you‚Äôre using median one article‚Äôs estimate support argument Covid isn‚Äôt deadly ‚Äî that‚Äôs what‚Äôs disingenuous.

You‚Äôre assigning median every person age 70 even though fatality rate varies greatly, age, also socioeconomic status, location, gender, ethnicity, access healthcare. problem. feel Malaysia interesting case. seen cheap medical tourism some, better quality medical home country affordable (eg Indonesia).

I yet seen people analysing competition among Asean countries this. interesting case study. IQ way measure vaguely defined concept like ""intelligence,"" however. Honestly, might good threat South. Clemson huge fan base So? They'll protest supreme court. ""Still human"" implies was, one time, human.

""More machine reptile."" country, Germany, numbers are

0.2/0.2/0.4

, way, there's huge uncertainty based less 50 deaths category. Common, isn‚Äôt one safer activities? 

No one spending next 12 months totally inside. It‚Äôs healthy mentally either.

I think beach lowest concern.  flu vaccine 30% success rate

You deliberately implying flu vax 30% effective designed for, false. 

If want say can't forecast dominant flu strains yeah I'm right that's relevant Covid.  Maybe. doesn‚Äôt seem case southern states. didn‚Äôt trust lockdown still went mingled. states trouble pretty low impact beginning. Sorry bring bad news, clinical trials vaccine go ensure significant side effects, expect least 18 months released. 

Source: study things Hardships caused *lockdown* pray God/Darwin must. Hopefully Karen goes extinct.  Thank doing. received good piece wisdom years ago: ""you can't help others help yourself."" Sounds like following that. 

This one moments deeply conflicted responsibility media government report ICU numbers moment.

I 99.9% time absolute staunch advocate transparency thorough reporting. could create massive panic would cause harm. easily imagine situation everyone bugs out, returns hoarding, infects everyone Costco.

Everyone accusing CDC irresponsible said masks initially. looking everyone's response, would run available N95s (there already was) thought NYC hospitals bad, would exponentially worse nurses getting infected already were. 

It's really fucked moral quandary. idea genuinely right move is. unprecedented. What's ""affair""? also married chick? scumbag? Unlikely moved forward. It‚Äôs like joke guy roof flood.


God created man intelligence creativity develop cures That's pretty clever actually. deleted. Looking profile, rambled couldnt provide detail either. I'm looking unbiased opinion sorry Lol nice parody ever wonder many stupid people world? happening long Facebook Twitter. Social platforms passed mainstream peak always gathering places types. guess makes sense backward-thinking people would drawn outdated technology feel home platforms ideas less likely challenged. happened IRC, Yahoo countless others. They're trying probably get re-elected taking decisions forced also please public. There's even point arguing kind stupid. usually turn around walk away shake head. entitled assholes America. mean we‚Äôre good go? im proud us literally want cry happy tears. 800-900 deaths day march look far we‚Äôve come. hope deaths better treatment living future NE US increasing testing, positivity rate increasing.

South West fucked around weeks get deserve fucking around taking serious. Deaths lag active case numbers check 3-4 weeks. going brutal riots? mean peaceful protests find source isn‚Äôt full misinformation. Anyone know happened people took part pool party who's videos went viral weeks back? antagonism happened directed suspected tourists continued cross border height border restrictions.

That's precisely fear. 

I'm planning go prolonged visit, I'm worried plates draw negative attention 2 weeks isolation over. 

How exactly people know tourist, legit reasons? Obviously &amp; taking anger random people. don‚Äôt even know point is.  incorrect NY NJ highest death rates US?  mainly due horribly states protected vulnerable elderly?   calling smug pointing advance anything? Depends many. Low enough

Sweet summer child. Oh shit, go tell Dr. Fauci folks CDC. vaccine given entire planet exact time free charge, sure. billions people Asia Africa can't afford I'm skeptical pharmaceutical companies would start biggest disease eradication drive history pocket. Even fully working vaccine there's still real risk becoming permanent endemic disease human repertoire disease reservoirs developing world eradicated Winning! one allowed inside business without mask. Especially cop - role model fucking prick. Yes, idiots think virus politics. read study posted that's problem. study proves younger people better outcomes, even hcq  EXACTLY fuck voted Kane Mayor????

Meanwhile, wife talking whether homeschooling instead sending daughter. imagine discussion happening country right now. take vaccine hope natural selection occurs done. Or, y'know, that.

Interesting.  hope think look people eyes shopping. fully understand efficacy? Oxford vaccine testing Brazil within two-three weeks, say 60% individuals antibodies need therapeutics due Covid-19 exposure, feel though enough evidence start vaccination mass. point, especially America‚Äôs, seems way less risky start vaccinating waiting say November-December allowing virus continue growing possibly mutate end year. Thoughts? Yeah, EVERY person I've spoken vaccine says plan taking right now. EVERY person. recurring theme hear ""it's rushed there's way I'm taking rushed shot year early part next year"".

I try explain rushed, new type vaccination technology coupled years extensive research coronaviruses, that's make bit difference them. Note, attitude coming anti-vax dolts. mother says this, never expressed vaccine skepticism before.

Public health officials going work cut comes convincing people take shot. going another bullshit 50-50 split opinion like mask wearing. social media going atrocious conspiracy theories microchips DNA altering. fair, 600/day using 7 day rolling average.

No wonder fucked nation. little disingenuous mention statistic without mentioning worst-hit 27 states + DC (with combined population double UK) **have higher per-capita death rate** UK. 

OK? assume areas UK also harder hit others? instead hiding 25% ""influenza like illness"" ""pneumonia"".

That's unproven conspiracy theory last knew. Feel free link proof, evidence, statements coroners suggesting ""25%"" hidden.

Also widespread availability testing leading people aware concerned exposure getting tested.  good thing encouraged. now?

Because back follow rest world would possible semblance leadership.

If coordinate attack states acted unison one guidebook states could follow. everyone whatever wanted.

And yet people debating masks saying bar lives matter.

Now tsunami hitting everyone accordingly depth hole dug themselves... morbidly obese losers made bed afraid lay it. Sad. come conclusion China honest Australia is?

I tell right Australian government definitely honest. 3 weeks ago, massive corruption scandal. months ago, former PM said banning Huawei purely due anti-china sentiment. keep going Lol ok. germs appear where. Masks literally reduce transmission, states people going without them. Help baby jesuz Same. 

Love, 
Someone trapped Houston Deaths decreasing better job month ago.

The temporarily decreasing death toll reminder *we know better*, justification fucking up. handling coronavirus national embarrassment. Wolf gets lot shit handling pandemic state, keep safe. economy recover, never recover replace lives lost virus. 

And plus, ones worried economy think it: need people support it. Save protect people first economy rebound come sooner rather later. 

I much care politics, going whine, go suck pacifier deal it. worries people seeing wearing mask.

Ok I'm done. good night/day wish everyone good health this. ‚úå Honestly going sound harsh but...she needs let go. I‚Äôve following story past months keeps getting worse worse. He‚Äôs suffering chance recovery probably low. heartbreaking. Hopefully passes peacefully least doctors make painless. Please. America never control pandemic first place. local news station AZ theme song sound bite play advance story wildfire. Every time hear think ""geez hell fire now?!"". weeks since watched news hear song. Instead initial studies found negative outcome likely kill due heart complications, study flatly denies.

You know study pulled couple weeks ago Lancet found entire study based fake data fake company created 2 months ago scientists, sci-fi writer adult It‚Äôs kinda funny. Although Disney World property must nice send best teams shit show You‚Äôd look county. Add negatives positives get total number tests. 

Statewide there‚Äôs 22,075 total known cases, 279 deaths. problem June 1st 7,443 total cases. It‚Äôs control. Meanwhile Ireland 0.1% positive rate. It‚Äôs even scarier realize July fourth weekend. It‚Äôs first large holiday since started people celebrate large groups keep Bears fans out? lol

Yeah, screwed WI. Since supreme court decided governor DHS can't actually take actions keep public safe feel like much do.

I'm honestly afraid I'm still seeing people posting made ""freedom"" ""hur durr face masks keep getting COVID."". Pool testing beneficial certain instances. According Michael osterholm, definitely limited terms testing. shitshow. bitter, sad truth. Lol. ErCoNoMy GoOd, DuMb LiBiTaRdS. it‚Äôs perfectly fine everyone else Pres VP get it. Fuck political elite shit. shouting considered domestic abuse? never considered domestic abuse. find hard believe 100% households US domestic abuse shouting counts.

Plus points several flaws study. Looks like rate severe physical domestic VIOLENCE 46% (1 4 females 1 7 men). Although that's lifetime. ECMO although briefly beginning. guy got screwed . Really sad. infection rate Miami-Dade 19.5%. 

Reminder: 5% considered manageable. 10% considered Red Alert territory. 20% full crisis mode.

They‚Äôre quite simply going overrun. Yeah, food/staples that's probably best way. rent/mortgage utilities frozen. Ofc idea March/early April thinking would possible lock couple months get this. idea would work timespan we're going actually need though. Give couple decades. GOP dwindling voting base catch drift. Yep. I'm retail told say anything. We're going enforce unless get police pressure, seems unlikely. true access medication another major issue that's another discussion agree tests equally BS grades are? personally never went school besides college I'm fine. spending time 'real world' painfully obvious little correlation well rounded, kind, successful, person good scores school. anyone think school prepares kids reality? think single important controllable factor kids development behavior parents. Instead tanked economy, let run wild.

Is America great again? here! went library often librarians knew me. Downside that, child, missed lot social development idea interact people I'm close absolutely without doubt least 100,000 new cases day. 


We *caught* 51,000 them. here, like driving autobahn, except faster. cop rescued mother psychotic father kid. used beat shit us finally called cops. Even worse family member TX pretty much complete denial latest, week ago, tests inaccurate probably one it. well aware April still seeing doctors weekly breathing difficulties. pace, US recording 100,000 positive cases per day August 15th:

and world see 300,000 cases per day August 3rd:

New conclusion: we‚Äôre still doomed guess #Translation: 
Not regions handle task mapping infection spread tested positive covid-19. patients take responsibility infection tracking, Uppsala region checks made tracking actually carried out.

""It's large volumes tested positive hospital staff currently able to,"" says Johan N√∂jd, infection control physician Uppsala region.

The Uppsala region employed ten medical students retired doctors contact tested positive covid-19, currently 100 day.

But next step - call friends, family work colleagues - tested positive themselves.

**So really patients responsible infection tracking?**

- large extent, yes, says Johan N√∂jd.

When comes healthcare professionals seriously ill people covid-19, regions take responsibility contact tracing. new task government test spread infection widely among public, several regions place responsibility infected.

In addition Uppsala, applies in, example, √ñsterg√∂tland, Stockholm region almost 2000 people week tested positive covid-19.

Some regions mixed form, healthcare professionals agree patient infection tracking done.

In Region V√§sterbotten, two nurses recently hired infectious agents.

- infection trackers able make contacts. patient says call family close friends, it, says Stephan Stenmark.

#Transferring infection tracking patients live World Health Organization WHO's guide infection tracking covid-19, published May. sets much stricter requirements.

And according Johan N√∂jd Uppsala region, checks infection tracking really takes place.

- call double check check, says Johan N√∂jd.

Facepalm. It‚Äôs frustrating see Sweden unable implement contact tracing properly. Hopefully they‚Äôll get together soon. least regions better others felt life knew end

Well, actually happened. least certainly changed lot (uni student). facilities certified produce GMP items, anything that‚Äôs going used vaccine manufacturing, take years get certified. top looking years incorporate product legal paperwork actual vaccine production process. 

Due extreme measures needed this, manufacturers able produce items don‚Äôt keep much slack production schedules. It‚Äôs costly unused equipment sitting around time, effort, money needed certify constantly re-certify them. 

A global wide vaccine astronomically unplanned manufacturing uptick, capacity simply doesn‚Äôt exist. 

Im sure everyone‚Äôs FDA equivalent agencies fast tracking, you‚Äôve got understand insane paperwork side things. Considering I‚Äôll bringing sheets future may well floor pile curbside pick food?

You‚Äôre good view mind average American idiot. Huh, one would think good news apparently hours hang sun. There's 2-3 week delay increased confirmed cases corresponding increase deaths.

As might able imagine, die soon get sick. still, wonder people symptoms specific COVID written common cold allergies could misdiagnosed (or never felt bad) tested virus.

With said, possible someone like me, whose respiratory system assaulted every year seasonal allergens (and gets worse every year) ""asymptomatic"" COVID blame pollen? would never ever happen USA

um... Think way parent 8-10h full week hospital full people noise, get home probbly dobt energy anything aftwr running around taking samples getting tested test hubdreds samples day. tell yeah im fine dont need days off. Usually viral spreads cant blame hospital people didnt stay indoors didnt keep distance people. Herd immunity actually strategy. understand think though, since lots media outlets kinda ran it. Yea, they'll say ""the police bunch pussies left us stopped protecting us"" paradox see. That's probably got something people south repeating mantra ""ThE sUmMeR hEaT kIlL ViRuS"" since March. Imbeciles. That‚Äôs called education system. knockoffs cause serious side effects though. spend way much money value education get. People taught critical thinking, sure shit taught version history even bordering states. obviously know nothing chicago minimize contact them. really hard people do?

Are people fucking grandmother something?

The amount people seem flabbergasted dont close physical contact elderly relatives makes question things.

Are panic porn doomed living grandparents something more.....incestuous going on? diseases respect lines drawn maps, right? much kids going learn schools open back immediately close back teachers students get COVID? Yes, point they‚Äôre evil it, guess commendable nowadays Thanks information! I‚Äôm beer guy, it‚Äôs good know something‚Äôs available things go south again. is.

Sweden never even got opportunity. article march said went unchecked USA would 2 million deaths end. think honestly heading it. Like every country? Finally, smart person sub maybe get subreddit devoted coronavirus? Seriously. Mango running ground behalf putin.

Fucking traitor fair, didnt say anything dealing pandemic running office. follows promises. üòÜaround put good show I‚Äôve told one none care anymore York got super early, idea treat wasnt known time. effective treatments know disease, death rates significantly dropped (I read somewhere 4x likely survive die better treatments )

Can give cite? I'm calling BS one.  cuz testing bro

Hahaha!!! problem funding. lot governments donors may wary giving money prepare future disease may may happen. race diseases also short sighted governments care amount immediate results. 

In America researchers working SARS vaccine lost funding SARS died down. Since SARS also type coronavirus vaccine would great stepping stone toward solving Covid19 vaccine issue. think HCQ lost political juice now. far tell sides moved on, let doctors read decide themselves. reason they're offering significant increase funding move vacuum created US withdrawal. largest national funder US able secure many high level positions, usual arrangement international orgs. 

Don't let US fool you. Trump trying scapegoat electoral fortunes. kind thing common practice US, though restricted them. Look history around US pulling funding UNFPA. Different context basic idea. Coincidentally, used similar manufactured reasoning relating China well. 

This kind gamesmanship part parcel UN organizations. Countries always trying increase influence often use orgs political benefit domestically. Unfortunately, diplomacy politicking comes expense beneficiaries ground. reason tell need wipe groceries packages ""Why would trade mild symptoms stop pandemic that's already taken 130,000 lives country alone?""

Is real life? They'd probably day nah. that's circus now. China things right got control literally putting people quarantine. 

We *lucky* sickness deadly that's kind action that's needed pandemic. Ah yes *mild* pandemic. Nothing worry about. choose activity certainly delights sharing drinks, communal snacks, people getting drunk mindful distancing speaking moistly, mask wearing... doubt transmission protests traditional 4th July parties amplify lack distancing. 

I say Canadian knows one person Canada Day celebration week looks like 8 people attendance. city events cancelled. live island 750,000 2 active cases. hope Americans make similar decisions. development terms cures significantly reduce risk death.

All said, whatever come accelerated trials, it‚Äôs likely going enormously important people take vaccine, regardless specific (but presumably low) set risks unique accelerated vaccine. sure would first line. clearly says small, single study. means testing necessary know anything. cannot assume immunity, cannot assume herd immunity even possible even 6 months, let alone year.

Non-AMP link. Desperately? like comfortably. Freedom comes responsibility, price. choose. Holy crap here. better start exercising it‚Äôs late! looks amazing 79! confusing median mean? link broken phone, it‚Äôs plausible mean 69, SD 5 years. Yeah based vaccine originally started combat SARS back outbreak happened mid-2000s work stopped SARS ended 2004. pretty regularly, want example, tennessee updates data like clockwork 3pm eastern time. worldometer usually updated within 15-30 minutes means anti vaxxer - support vaccination, also even update phone firmware months case bugs upgrade process. That's approach everything. think fair little hesitant. website lists complications associated new vaccines scientist theoretical, unforseen oversights consequences known deployed en-masse (for example smallpox vaccines severe complication .0057% administration's.) wrong.  feel like reason even paying people much extra money work votes come elections.  think enough low payed essential workers taken advantage count polls.

This makes sense covid vaccine results deaths however rushed vaccine doesnt work intended increase covid deaths 

""Aside questions safety attend vaccine, good reasons especially cautious COVID-19. vaccines worsen consequences infection rather protect, phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

Ill get bad boy yall take work issues hold up, sore arms? keep disease juice away me! Stop blaming 2020 lol, exposed. Poor science education. right ""kids read lots books want school"". But, unfortunately, leaves many lifelong aversion reading.

I'm disagreeing totally agree balancing act. But, experience, kids pick hard book *in subject interests them* easy book anytime.

I remember going bookstore two sons. roughly 7 8 years old sometime late 1990s. told could pick one book themselves.

The younger one picked 600+ page reference book dinosaurs ($50). (He carried book around weeks finished it. almost bigger was.) 

The older one picked ""The Lord Rings"" trilogy ($35). (He argued, successfully, really one book.)

Both books way reading level but, interested, persevered.  would much better avoid living lives die. way much fewer us would die Covid-19. no-brainer folks. words Mister Roger's cope crisis, ""think helpers"" focus good doing. point people going know someone who‚Äôs died COVID. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs really going sink in. say controlled January? locked Wuhan January declared emergency January mean anything. rural folks never wear masks. Cause yes wearing masks bad too.

Two bads balance out. Portland wearing masks protesting rural wearing masks protesting. balanced results

Your argument weak. Tickets include 15 day layover connecting flights.     /s religious exemption attend parochial school. That‚Äôs think. Public schools run based public health standards religious beliefs standards. Upper arm muscle like most. Non-amp Think like recipe.

That recipe already sold, everyone make cake. YAY going continue argue dumb care much. Multiple studies pegged IFR greater 1% based antibody testing well, seem acknowledge studies. one knows true number reputable sources putting .2% like claim. simply way explain IFR .2-.4% NYC .3% people die covid. facts cannot true time unless almost 100% NYC exposed covid, something even claiming. one ""facts"" must give way like live reality rather world speculation. good day.

Either way, keep repeating months now, since country still testing &amp; tracing system place, expect rate infection continue virus spreads like circle around country Stockholm..

Once give society/humanity though, makes easier get day. love Reddit - getting get downvoted stating facts! lol mean...I see see way. Adults given $1000, children given $500. Children people too, people need cared for. Thinking children get nothing insane thought. old enough use obviously parents get use them. fixthemask.com suggestion improve fit standard surgical masks.One way make brace 3 rubber bands. Ehh going beach isn‚Äôt really problem since outdoors it‚Äôs people gathering together is. regions NY fine? evidence numbers. voluntarily join military getting injected something consent for. 

Someone call uncle drafted fight Vietnam. [This data Goes July 1st. Two reasons - 

1: we're quite yet timeline. 

The reason many people dying *major* part outbreak concentrated NYC - many infected people health system could keep up, thus level care dropped death rate soared. 

While infections happening now, they're spread multiple different hotspots - Florida, Texas, Arizona etc, despite infected numbers larger, there's also space people admitted still ""okay"". start seeing hotspots reach capacity shit hits fan (EG, Houston 100% normal capacity already tap surge capacity right now; long start happening). 

Likewise, deaths usually lag behind quite bit compared infections, takes good ~10 days infection till start getting bad enough need ICU, additional time ICU till death (or healthy). Two weeks+ least expected, meaning we'll start seeing effect huge numbers infections two weeks time.

2:

We know lot virus back March, there's better treatment options may help curb death rate (EG, Remdesvir). along health systems quite overwhelmed *yet* helps low death rate. means it'll hit much harder system overwhelmed longer take good care everyone. 7 Day average positivity rates:

Texas: 13.92%
California: 6.93% One guy temp 103 fainted house recovered day, one person lower dose range rash injection site. choice trial country unfortunate (well fortunate UK decent job reducing virus). think anyone could seen US likely head disaster would provided better data. work people country girls work live California Arizona. guys opened went back Arizona right away stay parents get nails done/go bars. seemed reckless Illinois! ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ doubt 400,000 tests daily. Russia one worst responses country. Also there's whole thing nurses falling windows complain conditions.. Fucked country. Spare me. care protecting vulnerable, immunity healthy population crucial.

I give paypal email pay go work.

 say no, basing health safety co workers money. couldn‚Äôt farther truth blame anti-maskers.

Heard crazy MULTIPLE people. dumbfounding. policy decisions definitely contributed higher death rates countries lockdown.

Are suggesting countries 'under lockdown' Spain, Italy, UK Ireland? whole reason EU near 5 year mean whole bunch EU countries 0 negative mortality increase lockdown. places covid prevalence 1 percent, many much lower. F. Thank you. I've heard same, reporting Danish press too. seem likely pressure many play safe rather sorry! January 16th

Wuhan officials say health crisis over, encourage large public gatherings. Wuhan residents go government sponsored fair, citing government statements health crisis over.

do something show qualities worthy (reward punishment).


 ‚Äúwent crowded bar amusement park **pandemic**‚Äù This, repetitive cases, death total half picture makes Covid-19 high stakes virus. ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ doctor online patient portal, like mychart something? check there. think could make money back sponsors, public service announcements generally good corporate citizens home markets instead making things worse   17.7% positivity rate, yikes several reasons. 
First all, herd immunity would go effect 70% population infected, even theoretical scenario restrictions, 100 million US citizens may get infected. 
Second, infection fatality rate (IFR) far lower previously thought, overwhelming majority recent estimates fall IFR 1%, usually lower. 
Third, become much better treatment- medical professionals much better idea work COVID-19 patients, patient survival rate increased substantially. 
Fourth, better protecting high-risk groups, nursing homes people several COVID comorbidities. 
Finally, something hope rely on, vaccine well underway, several vaccines successfully completed first second phase trials, already starting third phase trials, means vaccine may approved earlier previously expected.
It's also worth mentioning recent surge COVID-19 cases alarming, nowhere near April terms severity outbreak.

All factors add make highly unlikely US even reach million COVID-19 deaths near future, much less several million. 100% feel like they‚Äôre TX AZ 

FL still wild card, sure fuck they‚Äôre actually seem really think there‚Äôs issue foot. Ironically, they‚Äôll likely hit hardest weekend crazy crowds everywhere well Oxford scientists didn‚Äôt anticipate another 6 months. anticipated September October. also hospital scrapped plan.

It's essential necessary, none less. clarify that's case, AMP spec specific rules include/exclude website, there's specific load time meet, sites served cache Google's server (so never load pages individual companies servers). Oxford expert said would ready July

There single report said vaccine would ready July point this. earliest ever said vaccine September show efficacy, distribution potentially October, Oxford still lines argument can't know sure risking everyone's lives actually uncertainty ego. need back uncertainty. Maybe ego lack logical reasoning. look mod logs wiki think automod picking something thinks related politics error. There's hard fast rules. less meet better. said that, I've getting together extended family another family couple months now. $$$$$$.

Why think push re-open ""get back normal""? many people look profits losses metric right.

People arsed right thing profit margin attached. ""We anything we're controlling it, believe countries implement strict controls possibly better"" - commenters um what‚Äôs stopping us locking like .. now? yes, know. said units produced UK Oxford societies efforts go Brits first. people using ""recipie"" make less true, India's stocks. earned every bit consequences bringing ourselves. 

We absolutely getting leadership results deserve allowed society become. 

And hell, maybe maybe learn nation come together grow, think way happens get 3 million deaths, hope us there, support easier status quo. Midsommer June 19. So, yes, one could contributed spread since involves lot singing, drinking dancing. 

Midsummer celebrated different forms different Nordic countries, yep! Finland called Juhannus think day Sweden. Denmark calls Sankt Hans Aften slightly different day. Norway also like Denmark: way, keep repeating months now, since country still testing &amp; tracing system place, expect rate infection continue virus spreads like circle around country Stockholm..

Yes, sadly true. trying build TTI infastructure although going well, hey, better try try! hope sort soon. people remain outdoors, socially distance, wear masks distancing isn‚Äôt possible, spread could easily remain low.

So draw line? people go beach remain pretty socially distant, everyone goes dumb people are, merely going stupid even near people, etc. still remember seeing highly upvoted posts bashing people going outdoor public spaces. going barbeque fine? CDC. feel bad there‚Äôs altruists (there well may be). youngblood dreams changing world better gets century pandemic working CDC, gets absolutely jack shit. watch CDC screw labels, mix stuff up, general look weak. Please free...  MERS! Another coronavirus. got started 2016. USA finally gets wall :/ wearing masks thing boggling me.

My brother's girlfriend often wear mask. She'll also go visit family dinners bbqs. one social distances.

He finally asked deal was.. avoid wearing mask go Target whatever? dug deep trying understand. think masks important, conspiracy whatever.  explanation ""I like it"". 

There go, ladies gentlemen, fucking fate world grips pandemic relies people something find inconvenience.  doomed. ""Promised much""

Remember Obama going close Gitmo, end torture, gets us Iraq/Afghanistan? looked even looked article. Glad know others vet sources 65% excess deaths Covid-19 good part remaining 35% probable indirect ties Covid (ICU overwhelmed, lack staff...).    
If goal article convince lockdown bad, failed. I‚Äôm mask requirements, access masks issue right now. Overexaggeration much? Lmfaooooo Better yet, lever switch choose candidate dispenses vaccine syringe.

The side choose decides whether vaccine placebo Winning! Sweden? course. way healthier us. every aspect. Honestly, think glaring failures :

- ruthless Healthcare / health insurance system ensures citizens slaves jobs (companies keep family's health hostage, anything ask)

- voter disenfranchisement, gerrymandering, electronic voting way actually tally recount votes, weird arbitrary obstacles voter registration

- lack actual, continuously updated, up-to-date census

- lack protection identity theft, lack form universal ID despite obscenely frequent issues related mistaken identity / identity theft

- legalized bribery form lobbying

- lack separation church state

- obscene price inflation tertiary education, enslaving people even chance get bearings adult world

- awful sex education limited reproductive rights

- widespread gun ownership, fetishization gun violence, police militarization, ""us vs them"" mentality, unbridled individualism 

- systemic racism sexism, still unaddressed 

- nearly non-existent workers' rights, limited sick days, vacation days, awful non-existent maternity/paternity rights

- charity donations normalized way help other, forcing people beg compete fucked-up pageant pity, instead recognizing rights fellow human creating system help automatically

These salient points. Every country issues, know, US special case, people suffer, go bankrupt, die, get killed, generally fucked constantly still people believe country best everybody else wishes could live there.  meme would fit perfectly... ‚ÄúEpidemiologist‚Äù eight syllables, roughly seven many Americans.

Wow, insane... July 4th normally sees ER visits, too. worrying. Yeah, keep us fuck outa country. want this. seems southern govt anti-mask argument day day out.

Goram reavers!! shit works, pledge take first vacation UK fucking audacity people use ‚Äúmy body choice‚Äù relation face masks truly mind-boggling hope. I'm optimistic. protesters people ideologically committed wearing masks. drinking celebrating whatever people 4th July.

People like use pandemic another way scold protesters, appears true acknowledge instead continuing it. risk. communities felt moral imperative protest outweighed risk. acknowledge lucky, mean people get scold us. Flu vaccine does. ‚Äúwait two weeks‚Äù become meme point Wishing well, friend read idiots parroting ""THIS DISEASE 99.5% SURVIVAL RATE, WORRIED IT?"" narrative, understand guy ""survived"" part survival.

Also understand media anecdote typical aggregate statistics showing people similar ages health statuses. way it‚Äôs straight 1 1 mapping function. one, death necessarily trails infection. Secondly, age group big factor - it‚Äôs elderly people going packed bars without face mask. Third, degree hospitals overwhelmed massive predictor casualty rates. That's know disease April. Since disease caused coagulation, doctors keep eye preemptively give anticoagulants. Also, doctors prolonging use ventilators possible keeping eye factors like high Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio biomarker decompensation severe disease. clearly treated Hydroxychloroquine either due studies warning useless dangerous side-effects. also biomarkers associated bacterial pneumonia virus causes doctors stopped relying give antibiotics, pneumonia, doctors also use proning. recently, dexamethasone found significantly drop mortality used.

Basically, sound like fool research blabbing around 'The last best chance contain COVID-19 shutting again"" weeks ago, enforced mask policy might worked. ship sailed.  lock downs collapses public's sense safety devastating economic impacts. Texas, Florida, Arizona possibly states face prospect both. Lockdowns needed slow spread, late avoid suffering economic damage spike severe COVID19 illness death.

Because U.S. unlikely able cut travel badly affected areas (like China Wuhan, Korea Daegu) shutdown domestic travel nationwide (as Italy Vietnam did), may ultimately necessary shut states yet showing signs rapidly increasing rates infection. Twitter easily disgusting usually people know.

Shorten pandemic awfulness everyone go get drunk fomo? 

People deserve nothing punished socializing. stupid scientific illiterate. Thats far disturbing eyes. disengenuous blame ""politicians"" we're seeing different responses different politicians. One one side people listening experts, following science trying save lives, side people openly sacrificing human lives S&amp;P500 calling hoax. Politicians EU countries handling pandemic much better, no, inherent quality politicians result disaster, fact many US continues vote absolute fucking moron grifters leaders. disagreeing wearing face coverings bit, pretty sure staying home bit sound medical advice. help stop spread afford charge heroes statues built for. chimpanzees, adenoviruses, UK first start administering.

*Taps forehead* remember times Europe didnt take coronavirus seriously either. act like morally superior everything. dont agree US‚Äôs handling shit agree, huge continent really make sense of.

It's purely geographical, obviously, without taking culture different regions context. talking geography guess works way, talking epidemiology work good. keep banks afloat stock market up, course! require mask churches, least ban singing indoors. many super spreader events need? Remember Prince Andrew molested girls? That‚Äôs viruses work buddy. create cells keep formula antibodies stored body fight infection quicker. That‚Äôs quite literally immunity is. much capacity left? Taiwan, President entirely absent scene. host epidemic press briefings, make decisions regarding opening / closures, take credit whatever success island have. Instead, task force epidemiologists led minister health takes full control situation, makes decisions based scientific facts.

As result, politics almost completely absent entire event. opposing party latch anything ruling party does, ruling party nothing except giving executive orders based recommendations task force. task force also refuses answer politically charged questions press conferences, (funnily) held workshops reporters ask irrelevant dumb questions.

It's course fortunate Taiwan's situation never evolved point shutdown necessary, probably prevented serious political dilemmas. find fascinating politics completely avoided let science take helm -- all, politics negotiations compromises, neither possible virus. president also prevented talking public. someone recently quit private jet company confirm this. completely deaf blind problems world think throw enough money disappear. sErVe pRoTeCt easy. employee file civil complaint POS.

No question here. real question still remains: come that

A. Netherlands open schools, wear masks, use pubic transit almost zero new cases.

B. but, say, CAlifornia imposes 3 month shutdown, everyone masks, schools closed, somewhat bends curve.

?

One observation Netherlands actually much deeper pandemics 350 deaths per 1M population) California 160/1M.. so, well may California imposed shutdown early, brutal enough stop virus altogether bad enough could maintained long, Netherlands (accidentally) imposed shutdown right time.

Another, guess, that, maybe, maybe, reason, herd immunity 60% 5-15% range that's Covid19 spiking Netherlands: close enough critical level. Eagerly awaiting reddit phds show unskew number us think government, structured, best do

It absolutely best wtf. wrong neither they. really sucks. mean, thought logically, would believe anything.

Most people support lockdown.

So telling there's people support lockdown throwing COVID-19 parties? course not.

But many college students broke working one two jobs?

Most.

Ask what's likely true. Pre-meds jello shots catch rona trying catch internships hospitals? Make money baby sitting?

And know media repeatedly wrong urban legend type stories. There's razors candy, needles theater seats, tidepod edibles. Lmao college students buying tide pods? know expensive shit is?

And media absolutely benefits believing Corona parties, advertisers parent companies, forcing back work. Lockdown stopping undiscovered exponential growth beginning. Afterwards several measure kept life getting back (almost) normal vaccine better treatment disease available.

Low-medium risk death, still risk residual health defects. seriously doubt want live rest life new morbidity. coronavirus indeed land opportunity 2,099 new cases. Sweden also one countries higher death rate per capita US blame ones spreading misinformation

again, plenty information said serious. (or others) choose listen to, instance, Fox News, that's fault choosing outlet benefits downplaying pandemic

no country suffering like US right now, 100% fault happened me. month month Ballys - moved state - bother cancel anything, month month anyway. Months later, LA Fitness took started billing 6 months former roommate warned it, too.

LA fitness WORST. fucking hate them. I'm former Texan; wanna guess why?

It kills people saying like Texas mention lack income tax that's totally unrelated every government service chronically underfunded, leading directly things say hate Texas. Bro read article lmao He's shining example, least response communication pandemic New Yorkers pivotal keeping us maintain social distancing safety guidelines, converted us epicenter state one lowest percentages daily cases. we're basically travelers certain states experienced recent surge new cases, Texas. 

His communication stark contrast chaotic mixed messaging Trump's unnerving lax tone Dr. Fauci's stern warnings. cure coronavirus North Korea lead head ! heavily disagree. mean dont fully disagree, great people finally going wear masks, heavily disagree ""whatever"" notion. surrendered plutocracy. wanted zero growth rate reopen - zero cases, zero growth. That's got. Thank god was

Sweden compare different approach. President told everyone we're best proves it, right? Propaganda aimed right people. think would seen spike yet? articles stating Texas hospitalizations continue surge June Holy strawman! said scenario won‚Äôt vaccine nearly impossible. many tested surely least work. US, outside ER what's considered bare minimum push door withhold care unless sick dying person pay show right insurance. total population Florida upper bound built online registration portal hillsborough county I've seen emergency management team add nearly 30k reservation slots system next week filled hours. one county. Disposable masks still way go, better cloth masks nothing yes. That's point comment. disagreeing article shared evidence stated. article statement opinion, historical fact.

The data provide cherrypicked support they're saying. look data see -- 
A. America see drop hospital rates? (every state) 
B. America see rise excess deaths (not every state)

Thus &amp; B same. say drop hospital visits = excess deaths. incorrect. = B, they're same.

Now, let's try this.

A. see excess deaths? (the states Covid control).
B. excess deaths could associated Covid? (yes)
C. excess deaths causes associated Covid, like cancer? (no)

Therefore evidence shows excess deaths closely associated control Covid hospital closures. House arrest then? Although arguably risking spreading others, deserve selfish. doubt it. Zombies eat brains.  know this, don‚Äôt want known it‚Äôll cost much people childcare 20+ Public Health Directors nationwide resign death threats stemming instituting scientific response COVID19. There's far many uneducated, selfish, entitled Americans leader sway all. Ignoring public education generations caught eventually. doubt distributing facilities need it, last batch, becomes available.

The supply limited reasonable job getting deployed previously. There‚Äôs reason suspect otherwise time. ultimate payor majority doses likely Medicare Medicaid programs anyway, feds would buyer regardless. Counties overriding anyway. Sedgwick County (Wichita) voted reduce strongly recommended mandatory. one anything different.  Bexar, hospitals verge crisis.  agree, wouldn‚Äôt feel safe even distancing. End July I've stressed say least. Maybe obsessed numbers? 

Every state mask requirement least month either declining rates, small uptick Memorial Day one really even call uptick.

Every state large uptick either mask order (I count employee requirements) implemented order recently.

The one outlier California. implemented exactly 2 weeks ago, still increasing. rate increase leveled last days though. mean, written lens someone trying manage mental illness, lot people dealing right - breakdown mental health.

I well, may also well (and way listed certainly supports inner dialogue someone dealing anxiety depression) always well could see way another world. (As of) Exactly. midly rushed vaccine comes mind (I think 2 3 years research) absolute heartbreaking disaster dengue vaccine children thr Philippines years ago. realize later worked properly already infected least dengue. first time getting infected, gave much higher chance causing severe dengue response rather usual convulsing fever. Severe dengue commonly seen people who've infected times serotypes. Considering 25% dengue positive people show symptoms fever, like 2% get severe dengue (the reaction like 30% death rate untreated), dengue vaccine sent bunch poor Filipino kids front severe dengue line. I'm guessing people, least parents, Philippines going wary new vaccine showing new virus. house fire let people die inside fire department arrives?

I don‚Äôt understand attitude 130k+ lives considered expendable. I‚Äôm truly sorry US, mindset profit engrained, earning dollars worth human life. Oh shutting let get way far ahead Texas lethality rate 1.5 well outside worldwide averages.

I really hate games politicians playing reporting, prevents dataset analyzed quickly. Can't stress enough unknown beast, best avoided precisely ""recovery"" ultimately mean. get sick! Oh god it‚Äôs dumb racist ass again. wish virus anyone fuck guy. buddies spread much dangerous misinformation. Heard immunity needs 70% so. Way soon count that. Would mind expanding this? mean say one tested long enough? wearing mask controversial right now, imagine shitshow going vaccine sitting yelling screen... look behind you! go there!

 But, always, always do..  like Friday 13th part Ah, yes, true. Staying home exactly kept 6'x6' concrete box steel door, windows, means access outside world! 64k deaths 1 day? Polls may say that, people aren‚Äôt following though. Hence spike. Oh yeah agree states close borders. nuts shocks me, people surprised fact many people trust government. act though fears without merit. Unfortunately asking question answer likely get deleted moderator anyway goes. 

First act though government never put corporate monied interests human life. ignore fact classified vaccine zero liability shouldered developer pretend fiduciary responsibilty make profit company disappears. even worse end apologist obscenely rich corporations arguing ROI treated higher regard hazards take face. 

Next like tout safe things though vaccine court, draconian process pay millions millions dollars people gave injured, demonstrably injured vaccines. know worse, people pay get vaccinated fund process fees paid get vaccinated fact injuries vaccines acknowledged court (which required even standing case heard). 

How Dr. Fauci testify front Congress without single Congressperson asking financial interests hold companies producing vaccines? wonder question likes Bill Gates 450,000 kids India paralyzed vaccines touted gave. sterilization products found tetinus shots administered African females? can't fathom people question motives man interviewed CNBC stating, twisted smirk face, medical vaccines 200% ROI $10 billion investment. 

Now entire economy destroyed never done before, locking healthy people opposed isolating sick, told first rushed vaccination 31% effectiveness rate virus indications (we really know thr testing questionable numbers add up) nearly deadly told predicted so-called experts. number tests goes up, number infected followed however number deaths falling. 

The CDC, NIAID missteps go okay, Holy shit lock in, go wear mask need it, wait need wear masks. would trust tell us anything? Fauci actually admitted lying masks want supply get compromised? Since lying official acceptable? 

31% effective. $2,000 $3,500 per person 7 billion populated planet. Sure thing, motives questioned? nerve call us morons? question intelligence? Give break. 

That's even quarter reasons question that's another thing, questioning goes body acceptable thing. hell tell allay fears, unfounded? tell yourself. Put ho-hos step back soda. let ride Im line vaccines do, provable, harm cases? 

Now lets see long comment allowed stand I'm tired real reasons skeptics never finding way onto pages. people ask questions us unwashed masses give answer censor it. help goddamn conversation, hurts it. worst part censorship Yeah happened Gettysburg last time also. 

It was......Russians course trying stoke division. amp works mobile arguably better coz faster loading idk posting link like jumps 11k change world meters second world deaths. Also deaths per million would pretty staggering. cost 131,000 lives! great plan. /s It‚Äôs disturbing desensitized society become virus death thousands. buy mask companies first agree more! That's exactly article shared concludes. That's it. I'm calling every anti-mask idiot, snowflake. They'll love it.

Coronavirus cases date = 250,000 .00625%

Coronavirus deaths date = 6300 .000155%

More people died accidents date. High 15‚Äôs surely China's numbers inaccurate reached testing capacity, government saw one number decided divide 10. country's confirmed numbers truly accurate sense.

But none really matters. matters hand dealt with, matters play hand. China dealt horrible hand, deal virus anyone else anything known spread, etc.

The US weeks ahead information, made wrong moves. Oh no, sorry, I‚Äôm discounting implying it‚Äôs bad there. wondering population spread state. Right post shutdown. shut entirely 20% still got 40%, South Carolina 20% shut all. utter embarrassment Americans care staying safe. correct ! happens population abandons science Gov Douchey: TenYearsTenDays never lets little things like facts get way narrative. asked mom good idea fucking even party literally look said ""why be"" know mom I'm little worried fucking global pandemic I've hearing kind like want die watch love ones die well



i'm sorry hear mom yeah...This whole period quite eye opener.

I find quite astounding people realize fuck happening literally half world stopped everything went lockdown...

trillions dollars income thrown away.

how much money NBA lose example immediately shutting down?

and people still act like nothing.


it's simply astounding quite terrifying well. Critical thinking reasoning severely lacking large percentage people that's good. RemindMe! Two Weeks ok telling women/man currently beaten potentially murdered partner ""tough luck, made poor choice relationships. Call us still alive morning we'll help get shelter.""?

We need police respond every DV call now, probably fraction, legitimate situations law enforcement needed. took err jerbs!! Thanks that. I've never actually seen someone get knocked try catch tweetie birds flying around head Ben Rothwell knockout.  Prob Canadian. shoot fireworks then? Yes!!! Dont let anyone US countries! People around need stop acting like fkn joke decide dont want participate dont want to. Wear fkn mask, keep kids home unless cant, stay ass home dont need go out. done one month would now, wtf this. 30-40 year olds stroking 4 weeks symptoms.

Week 1: infection

Week 2: progression symptoms/hospital vs hospital

Week 3: improvement/discharge vs decompensation/icu

Week 4: hypercoagulation state

Week 5: around pediatric inflammatory syndrome shows up.

Covid weird virus affects people wide variety ways  would say R0 virus continues stay 1 places U.S., holiday weekend probably add little top that.

To get R0 well 1 requires shutting non-essential businesses public services, seem lost national that. I'm scared bad outbreak going get. Ironically trump probably could re-election he‚Äôd acted sooner nothing repeat Fauci‚Äôs advice. handed reelection silver platter threw away. thought Americans give US passport applied another countries. Sorry hear miss wedding, would definitely make decision. saw story today groom India super spreader infected 100 people wedding. sick wanted cancel sides family insisted still happen.

Ah thank much post saw bunch posts saying icus packed assumed covid. state order here, there's choice. idea reddit mask order solution anything working out. deaths rise couple realize death rate trending down, right? Let's circle back couple weeks tell deaths rose. Look forward it. 


RemindMe! Two Weeks tweet proof, like releasing test results?

I'm saying Schaub desperate attention would make disease killed 500k people but... Stubborn, pig-headed, take advice trump. Even people thought respected.  People dumb, wearing masks, social distancing turning things political statement caused spikes. end game here?

Cases setting records every day seems plan slow spread. Except Italy handles pandemic. half country thinking it‚Äôs hoax. same. wealthy enough charter private jet 

You afford jet charter making 50k/year. Don‚Äôt worry, covid kills people aren‚Äôt 100% perfectly healthy. lot us don't, either Get fuck outta well reasoned well written observations.

We rage, puns, stupid round parts! can't anything it.

Reported misinformation Minor league ball cancelled, bag cancel major league ball already. Quit dragging out. even best efforts thing beast. There's rumor mandatory mask enforcement happening next week. I'm sure enforce it, though I'm lawyer. seem remember domestic travel can't barred without due process. Unlikely: greedy knowledgeable leadership would practical, first important directive remain power. vulnerable minorities... also base, includes lot overweight, vulnerable people. actually wanted let run advantage, they'd implement policies would advantage base certain areas making harder find help minorities (look f.e. they're voter suppression). complete lack response advocacy ignoring response even base suggests pure ignorance anti-establishment thinking: course increase support, people support start dying rate, see evaporate real quick (and is, reportedly, happening approval rating dipping lower ever.) would love irony Americans getting busted entering country illegally. Medical establishment voice reason since day one. Oh , ‚Äúmuh rights‚Äù. McDonald‚Äôs shut stores go drive only. Nobody deserves attacked, employees don‚Äôt make enough money take shit like that. oh laude chlorinated pool. boring hot. Plus skin rash later due much chemicals used treating sweat fecal matters. So, why? Especially now. look section ""where new cases increasing"" specifically look cases per capita. AZ, along FL SC charts compared states rising infections. truly scary. goes along high test positivity. world hurt... Khabib lightweight GOAT. Within ESPECIALLY non public health folks charge. many times we'd say x z important state finance department would tell us no, not, shiny thing, yes we're slashing funding anyway etc. annoys news politicians talk surge capacity. doesn‚Äôt mean 150% new normal. means stretching already exhausted medical staff even thinner. Guess what? icu nurse cannot take care 3 patients time without sacrificing quality care.

It‚Äôs simply sustainable. instead spend day talking whatever trump tweeted Yes, wearing mask crowded massive groups like sardines totally ""responsible"" mask like magical force field, right? Get real. epidemiological studies I've read say 40k-150k deaths October depending levels easing. 80k seems oft-quoted number.

He predicted 250k-350k next eight weeks. seen single study backs numbers. may actually pay wall keep Americans Mexico! laugh loud! They‚Äôre particularly smart either.... bothered get second passport non banned country (as many rich people tax benefits) would fine enter. Plenty 20-year-olds countries seem issue, must American problem. think young people countries realize things concerned besides death make decisions accordingly. Americans far lackadaisical attitude towards sickness general. country actually accepts encourages people going work they're ill punish taking precautions like calling sick? dont care killing others.
Go talk someone who's immunocompromised ask many people actually care illness think they're exaggerating you. Americans content live dog-eat-dog socieity prior chickens coming home roost. always scrambles brain every read time tried it. that‚Äôs thing US ‚Äî companies catastrophic results pay settlement. settlements usually way lower profits. financial incentives absolutely skewed. 

(And I‚Äôm accused anti vaccine ‚Äî get flu shots believe tested vaccines. rushed quickly.) *unzips penis* Can‚Äôt terrorism don‚Äôt believe virus exists. RIP Service industry worker here, us forced back work. People applied PPP loans turn work, likely denied unemployment. I‚Äôm back work, working double hours significantly less pay &amp; serving people inside wearing masks. local small practitioner vaccinating many people around well. dealing many people 75-100 people charts for. overloaded well. can't turn people away patient. so, come walk stomach flu symptoms next day come patient.

7. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Similar article, think herd immunity factor big picture, magic number switch flips.

For example 40 percent region immunity, rest populations wearing masks, think virus infection levels drop quite rapidly.

The US probably country near levels herd vaccine available. Broad infection levels reach 30-40 percent early 2021, hopefully time vaccines start widely adopted. Ironically anyone resistant vaccines point probably caught virus part herd. imagine uproar feds came states told do. Dems would field day probably spin well enough gain house, Senate presidency. 99% normal ass. workplace projects work-from-home policy stay place winter. Workplace activity 40% last week compared week last year according Google.

Let‚Äôs see happens 90 % population gotten infected yet starts live life like normal again.. Well lack leadership plan bite ass.

Unfortunately live society punishes information firings death sentence people like me. Joe Rogan said ""it's small fraction people dying.."" talking bill burr, saying stop. understand thinks, everyone get US small fraction would millions. [Ways get around AZ resident contracted it. confirm, fukt. Fortunately past week I've seen huge increase wearing masks. People taking much seriously see someone suffering it. Unlike Terminator simple things make miss vaccine. Wear mask. Stay six feet away people. Wash hands. doesn‚Äôt. Still waiting disappear like magic.... Lets hope passes phase 3 then. Proof pudding... course rich people think rules don‚Äôt apply Definitely stock photo lost rest.

Paparazzi take photos powerful people want time. Yes coordinated nowadays always way still completely. 

As far sending photographers goes, would buy photo someone Italy work. need send someone there. baseball 2020. Yeah 
 hope Oxford vaccine now. Lockdown would ruin America adverse reaction Gardasil vaccine 2009 stopped vaccination course. Although I'll nervous Coronavirus vaccine especially given history, definitely get soon possible. Still anxious though! believe it‚Äôs probably closer real numbers. numbers hard prove people mollah regime. 

So wouldn‚Äôt put Iran totalitarian regime statistics. won‚Äôt get real numbers time. History tell us approximite numbers. Maybe 50 years... Calmer? think people worrying virus *too much*... haven‚Äôt bought gas since February! I'm sure response list long term disabilities one interpret data without science?

I realize saying ""believe science"" makes sound like religion never thought I'd see day significant fraction richest country world denied basic facts scientific theory. LOL USA 5 months listen Italy, literally everything happened etc... USA worst shape every 1st world country opened up. Social services considerably cheaper law enforcement. Especially cause lawsuits murder. Uh 100 - 200 cases daily while. even better. let Big Phrama see Right. Kidney. Heart. Liver. Lungs. Brain, too.

So really *anybody* dies almost *anything* infected Covid could qualify Covid death.

Even though Covid infections serious, lead death, happen get one light infections go die something else listed Covid death. Saying ‚Äúminority‚Äù it‚Äôs 30% 40% population control entire country via presidency, senate, Supreme Court fun way dismiss gigantic cultural rot. They‚Äôre four idiots screaming slurs pickup trucks. They‚Äôre millions people, they‚Äôre angry, wrong reasons. cheating electoral college, wouldn‚Äôt power...but way life dying out. know it. they‚Äôre cornered rat. cornered rat isn‚Äôt going take medicine (vaccine). won‚Äôt even take give cheese. They‚Äôll bite. think they‚Äôll die don‚Äôt. really it‚Äôs opposite. need change, change thing hate most. plenty go around state local leaders well.

Not mention individual behavior. We'll learned people act time crisis. pretty fucking depressing tbh. Treatment better now. way happens hospitals become full turn people away. They're right order.

What part tripping up? He's going wait late, July 4th real money maker business. profits made, shut down. Ironically, shutting holiday would best impact real recovery general population's health.

It's like junkie, trying quit, really want one hit; hope OD.  Well people believe rights issue rather scientific argument. Well, reminder went off, predictably impotent said be. Biden hiding basement that‚Äôs Dem front runner! matter Trump says point ‚Äúunite country‚Äù negatively spun media. Yeah :-) Anyway Wanted Rome popular magazine English foreign people living Rome. Deaths C19 plummeting. risky new vaccine needed. I'm reddit user, mainly English sub, see different versions local pop then.

About backing claims? really, stories run decide interesting report on. comment moderation also bit iffy what's left what's deleted.

But they're certainly good journalistic entity. stuff that's rewrites local media really poor low effort. Good thing woman pic mask somewhat face. What‚Äôs point even wearing it? I‚Äôm saying job isn‚Äôt essential, better worse teaching. asking teachers/students social distance together small room ridiculous you‚Äôre trying stop pandemic Yeah said wrong worst crime ebike... transportation sure youre recreationally riding ebike... water doin B. know part california live in, definitely parts. i'm norcal, rural county also red county, see maybe 1 20 people wearing masks, enforcement. currently surging here, idiots wear masks. ‚ÄúToo sloowww‚Äù.

US enforcement issue. Assume Q1 2021. There's way we'll logistics working large scale Q4. We've fucked every logistical challenge, we'll fuck up, dont think places new cases showing really care death toll starts going up. feel like sadly thats many caring about. see really threatens mortality. surprised hasnt started skyrocketing yet though. places running swabs. go 4 places find clinic still swabs. Found tho. governors decided open despite scientific community saying might better wait bey 'the economy'. post history funny. hate bill gates, hate fauci, hate protestors, hate pelosi... still seeem take virus seriously.

Anyone I've talked said would've done thing politely back out. still feel really guilty reason.

I'm also sad I'm watching friends even risk parents things totally normally I'm skipping major fomo. Idk anyone else dealing this. point you‚Äôre going stop blaming boomers problems. (From elder millennial) Well, let get control.. It‚Äôs like new York New York locked spike. Really worried 4th July gonna do, might really get 100k cases day.

Median age HCQ group 18 years younger, patients HCQ group twice likely receive steroids (since shown provide mortality benefit severe COVID), 44% less likely SOFA score baseline (meaning group receive HCQ severe organ damage baseline, independently correlated greater mortality). 

The findings neat, retrospective chart review without strong design, aren‚Äôt impactful. don‚Äôt think even suggest consider HCQ patients COVID, given previously released stronger prospective data showing negative cardiac outcomes high number confounders reported authors. 

It‚Äôs also bit disappointing see ‚ÄúCNN Health‚Äù‚Äòs senior editor background healthcare, guess expected given overall quality news days. Californians fucking stupid I'm confident ability Moderna *distribute* vaccine large scale, variety reasons.

However, work out, become incredibly important back-up. virus mutates significantly (unlikely, possible), Moderna best position respond quickly. sense, mRNA great delivery system bright future diseases.

But Moderna vaccine pipeline, I'd worried. Could explain means already development 5 years? like, vaccine working coronaviruses thus able switch production vaccine specific coronavirus? denier anti-vaxxer slightest, trying understand science process behind this. life saving care controlled someone thinks politics reason people live die.

Dengue messy nasty. vaccine still approved balance, may acceptable, controversial, affects recommendation. Apparently, risk never dengue (this memory; forgive errors). get dengue once.

Well well imagine lazy method, countries too, so.... will. working vaccine going first go politicians, soldiers, frontline healthcare staff, etc likely made publicly available. 
 
I'm still going stand line though potential covid positive people unless already got vaccine lessens symptoms prevents reinfection. Division field guide (NY Collapse) taught that. Trump one allowed misleading. 20 29 age group tend highest rate infection per South Korea data. 20 22 year olds college students. Congregate living dorms partying bars, frat houses etc. means - Universities going hot Covid mess. I'd say two countries cases (US Brazil) lockdowns way strict US. virus level minimal opened up.

Good thing never use Facebook Twitter, get infected. real potential collapsed nation.

We go forward this, bet multiple counties move down. ever time attack fronts (cyber, force, psychological, etc.) certainly create one hell window so. I‚Äôm sure come #1 #2 counties would make moves.

Retail stores remained open. Public transportation still ran (at lower capacity).

STORY HER

I POSTED PAST ... don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dismissive, it‚Äôs quality life older person would ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù. work hospital can‚Äôt tell many families let loved ones go really should. want ‚Äúeverything done‚Äù them. ends brain dead close brain dead person given trach/peg put nursing home never recover again. Another one. Another one spotted Ireland's numbers:

 deaths peaked 33% six-week period 25 March 2020 5 May 2020,""¬†Dr Teljeur said.  period, increase 1,200 deaths expected figures, 1,332 Covid-19-related deaths officially reported.""  Teljeur said last four weeks analysis, saw reversal trend, fewer deaths expected.

This ties rest Europe - amssive surge deaths, excess mortality dropping lower normal. 

My take - C-19 pretty much killed everyone going kill, we're seeing major surge deaths countries come lockdown. father recently(4-5days ago) contact(no physical) COVID patient flagged positive today. guy coworker sits around 4-5 feet father. Till now, dad visible symptoms. live different city planning visit 6th July(flight). dad( lives alone) worried might also contract visit him. view case contracts it, someone take care him. 
Let know do- travel defer travel week so?
PS-My father 53 years old indian currently relatives living around take care him. Also highly redzone state. Privilege, word looking privilege, rights. 

&amp; brought great example; would real shame bunch nudists got together showed wrong. understand problem, yes? least [according numerous true death rate COVID hovers percent half percent.  

That means Netherlands, 6,113 recorded known deaths COVID-19, true infection rate around 12 million infected (the high number) 6 million infected. (the low number). 


In nation 17 million residents, many 6 12 million infected public heath success. willful ignorance. LOl, might interest know surging states 20% positive. numbers still much higher peak surge. wear everything else day. key enforced, taken seriously, used *everyone* school. something that's normalized around them, they'll likely conform keep too. *Not* wearing one would seem weird. 

My local schools planning opening masks allowed, required, work. Even sent kid school mask, they'd see everyone wearing feel like either. might feel weird self-conscious odd one would avoid it. They‚Äôll start, get passed deadline withdrawal classes full tuition refund, move online learning due ‚Äúunforeseen Covid outbreaks‚Äù

It‚Äôs financial survival point. We‚Äôre number one!! Still ongoing clinical trials? Fauci doesn‚Äôt get make decision. Neither president. It‚Äôs governors state. restrictions vary Thank you!! Right, said he's 100% must be, doctor great track record predicting diseases all. I'm loop. Rogan say? dont know talking about. sure arent thinking ""cases""?

Because media quietly ""slipped"" cases replace deaths.

For reason, news stopped giving daily death reports switched focusing cases.

I actually think lot people interpreting ""cases"" ""deaths"" this. sure totally unintentional. site linked op wants register sign read article link simulation. normal case, want wait 3 years home exaggerated testing make sure safe? Worse case scenario fluish side effects going injecting bleach. one trying go way hurt hun, safe. right illegal things happen area. absolute SHITSHOW MORON.

BLITHERING fucking idiot many levels. 

[Like blamed Gay Marriage Obama Dayton Shooting I'm okay US population getting vaccinated Europeans well informed long term health risks year two. forgot sub worst auto mod reddit. summarize deleted comment, tourists still coming South Florida complaining we've closed beaches 4th July reinstated 10:00 p.m. curfew. people smart. stay home. would want come Miami 40,000 cases unknowable something anyone sense would do. let's say thing works decide move forward send people finally get it. process going like? imagine 300+ million people wanting get vaccine time going nightmare. plan distributed? would think reason people going sceptical new drug vaccine would long term effect nobody knows about. many commercials ""did take drug ten years ago well could get cancer die grow third arm call 1 800 ### #### get settlement"".. things time told perfectly safe turn something end killing us later life. healthcare system seems making money less care days American public doesnt work healthcare hard time trusting it. work make opinion valid quantitative data. Sorry. Young kids, giving fuck, blame data right there. Houston already started pushing patients hospitals, ICU hit capacity late last week believe? Yeah, many people tech industry I've met super anti-science-that-may-change-my-worldview. Anecdotal, seems worse ignorant people because:

- tech folks *think* know better, and
- ton power make world worse reluctance admit wrong. 

Again, every single tech person like this. I'm friends many aren't. totally surprise tech giant would listen people telling he's wrong. know lot smart people won‚Äôt take vaccine available fall. are, understandably so, little wary taking something rushed through, comparatively vaccines.

I‚Äôm essential worker probably get despite 30s healthy baby home don‚Äôt want bring anything home her.

I know you‚Äôre talking 5g types lot well educated types wary this, least start. Sure.

BUT.

There lot people see US monolith &amp; comment accordingly.

I'm also one states was, recently, successfully controlling spread. badly hit NY NJ, definitely top 5 early on.

Looks like we're take step back bars opened bit far &amp; we're spiking again.

Point is, lot us responsible states like lumped likes Texas Florida, chosen go full ""hold beer watch this"" pandemic. Jesus christ, people. facebook scare video something? looking understand virus want people drop dead appear chart day catch virus? ...and note: title omits held party SPECIFICALLY INFECT PEOPLE.  No, Id argue many states control now, control entire time. 

Washington state initial contact hot spot, isn‚Äôt even top 20 states cases. since current administration fired/let go CDC Pandemic response team replace them; also, help administration continues ignore scientific evidence advice! mean, they're getting board whole 'wear damn mask' thing we're, what?, 6 months pandemic? spike 4th July might take states entire hospital systems. already know teachers around may coming back. may kids alone there. number people hospital? capacity anywhere except NYC. numbers also least week old. still haven‚Äôt gotten results last Saturday. Testing ineffective control long wait time. People can‚Äôt won‚Äôt repeatedly quarantine ‚Äòmaybe‚Äô exposed. Even one new infection occurs per day...That's new record setting infection number. useful. Came this. Frightening. could make every kid wear mask ENTIRE school day I‚Äôd surprised. Especially recess. Take care. Sounds like sensible thing. wish well. Hard find sympathy, rules protection Canadian population. Damn near entire country agrees U.S. border closed, unheard public opinion Canada. add bonuses combat score? think ""amplifies"" incorrect worldviews people had, easily surround people think like you. Eventually think everyone agrees you, that's see social media. get timeline from? ""Some states good concordance number reported coronavirus deaths total number. Washington state Minnesota almost gap, South Carolina Texas considerable difference,"" Weinberger said. 

(Add Arizona Texas SC.)  also discrepancies districts within states record death causes: ""The coding person died vary lot person person jurisdiction jurisdiction."" Yup Alfred right. people want watch world burn. 

Well people stupid gullible good. disagree. reversed opinion danger finally manifested way clear large cross section population. wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúone magical thing‚Äù, across board dawning realization large chunk population spiraling control.

Disingenuous framing, contained one way another. difference contained humanely using voluntary measures strict martial law. Ugh makes head hurt. Like surgeons medical staff wearing masks decades reduce infection people still stupid enough believe BS. It‚Äôs political thing, it‚Äôs true everywhere country entire world. Death counts everywhere case counts, others 100% discrepancies every country there. doubt we‚Äôll ever really know true numbers really. would disturbing setting records completely blue randomly.

Oh cool it‚Äôs exactly hoped beautiful Yet still people South Florida vacationing, bitching we've closed beaches 4th July re-instituted 10pm curfew. read quote paper morning someone Iowa complaining come go beach couldn't, could think fuck first place? 

There 40,000 cases Miami-Dade county, stay home. Sure love money, idiot come right now. they're right every infected person know ten 400,000 infected people here. think that's actually possible 3 million people first place, insane come here. It‚Äôll us, you‚Äôll see soon. important differences propagation information social media vs IRL.

1. SM platforms either curate prioritize engagement, built self-selected networks.

2. factors create effective ""bubbles"" ""echo-chambers"" perspectives seemingly amplified repetition.

3. also tend *exclude* dissent contrary opinions, disrupts natural tendency accept repeated information.

In real life, say something really dumb, many corners, someone correct you, you‚Äôll naturally excluded. important social feedback ‚Äîand psychologically makes us challenge beliefs there‚Äôs regular resistance.

On one hand, learn create consensus. other, opinions socially viable tend marginalized, regardless ‚Äòtruth‚Äô.

Social media algorithmically ‚Äúmatches you‚Äù people reinforce (‚Äúlike‚Äù) beliefs. nothing ‚Äîno matter insane‚Äî marginalized... gets reinforced. history indicator, second wave impact usually felt first? i.e. Spanish Flu 1918? 

I surprised since pandemic declared federal level, thought CDC granted wider jurisdiction authority. Surprised able enforce.  Freedom slavery! Repurpose soda factory

People taken ridiculous amounts money defrauded government exactly test depends who‚Äôs he‚Äôs talking to. Joe Rogan personal beliefs. believes whatever interviewees telling him. based existing delivery platform (an adenovirus common chimpanzees)

Wait, what? last time took virus chimps go well... work hospital.

I'm blaming politicians actually responsible. Basically: let's say 10 viral tests 10 antibody tests.

Of 10 viral tests, 2 came back positive active infection. would accurate report active infection rate 2/10 20%. 

Antibody tests test active infections. would ridiculous include calculation active infection, that's do.

But let's say count anyway.

Now we've done 20 total tests, 2 positive viral tests. Suddenly looks like active infection rate 2/20 10%. halved including antibody tests, even though actually make sense count particular measure.

Our measure makes sense, number looks much less scary. using numbers make decisions (policy, health, professional, personal), inaccurate/misleading stats suddenly big deal. difference 10% 20% ""do nothing"" versus ""shut everything back down"" example, numbers really really matter.

(Obviously simplified math, methods, consequences.) body, choice"".

I wanna know many dumb motherfuckers abortion It‚Äôs likely pharmaceuticals countries acquire license mass produce vaccine - significantly expedite distribution process. another CNN article, doctor reported patients coming sick far gone, can't helped anymore. come earlier, might been.

I wonder many deaths occurring home counted stats. assuming goes well assume proper 70% mass inncoluation herd immunity. 

You‚Äôre saying deliver 5.5 billion vaccinations within next 6 months? Nope. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs debatable covid widespread April.  fire get new teachers guess. Speaking mass production I'm actually interested long it'll take vaccinate least 60-70% world wide population achieve herd immunity. It'd nice government releases vaccination data like covid testing see many people vaccinated potentially see there's side affects ever stray Mozilla, remember amazing tabbed browsing Firebird?!?! Didn‚Äôt answer question. one earning anything person. reason civility rule exists. don‚Äôt deserve any. walked work today, 2 miles across Helena, MT. Walked many businesses went two (convience store McDonalds). thought would count masks patrons inside stores business. counted saw 130 people inside, publics places walk. counted total 3 people masks, two wearing chin. includes maskless nurse/staff person working fix window inside elderly care facility fixing window. employees wearing masks, including McDonalds. safety testing. extent normal phase 1. MERS formulation ever proceed phase 3. safe enter phase 3. Let's pretend less that. family education. local district, they're giving parents choice whether kids attend school person and, kids attend person, they'll issued PPE aka setting potential power struggles. groups increased risk dying means they're ones dying. mention increasing evidence long-term damage, even mild asymptomatic cases. 

Also, exactly think kids going go home to? Nothing perfectly healthy 20-somethings? kids bringing COVID home school delivering directly elderly, pre-existing conditions, infant siblings, etc. can't put kids bubble like they're NBA. immediately happen soon infected similar Cancer kill right diagnosed it.

Right, things opening big ways small past month. Protests, etc. stuff.

And all, every day, fewer fewer people dying Covid.

Today say USA lowest number daily Covid deaths since March. IRONY, love going Bill done much great work doubt take credit helping contribute Silicon Valley culture Microsoft helped establish. [Here Would good business strategy... yet spreading control lot spread mexican migrant workers. already have. Florida's 7 day death average climbed 42 yesterday. Highest since mid may. another 68 deaths today, Arizona already time high. Texas approaching one. hospitals fill up, numbers accelerate. healthcare ruins long time. Florida finally gave announced fianlly give us data COVID-19 pressure, Florida start reporting many people hospitalized COVID

Before that, tried obscure overall hospitalizations everything, really know sure. Yes think that‚Äôs happening Remember people flipping city first reported 5-10 cases?

Pepperidge Farm remembers first videos I've seen inside Texas hospital.

People absolutely insane ignoring this. Adult parents fine. they‚Äôre 65 pre existing conditions don‚Äôt visit them, live perhaps government pays move government housing vaccine comes out. Cheaper paying everyone stay home economy producing next nothing. stupid can't believe can't happen watching happen 150k+ others. Yeah, we're setting sort example surprise all. Think Ivey said 'we're NY, we're CA'. Well, take another look now...... want make seems like ""Dems"" ones making wear masks, something fight against. know outlier is? Well cannot force anyone take vaccine think vaccine produced hastily without enough safety data. every small town world hotspot, due massive mass transit systems, huge share elderly population. Got it. think confused one earlier studies. think mutations interesting aspect. would expect mutations spring start testing vaccines. right though, popular topic sub. [Try again, doofus talking Americans returning home Europe. Also backed common sense. comes Benjamin's. dont need rocket scientist figure stuff turns humans real virus.

What's worse within waiting period see much assholery people equate wearing masks higher trending numbers happening result wearing masks last week earlier. 

We chance leadership blew it. government define that. USA 40% population obese, doubles risk ending ICU. get locked not? Source: know. Imagine resources someone like bezos...and actually something make country place world admires. country perfect greater population people perfect, get outta blame game, president idiot idiots america like idiots country think it‚Äôs like game chicken. wanna close also want deflect blame other. Looking outside, think ""Why, USA? this?""

I truly dont understand would throw caution care wind, sacrifice fellow citizens, defy knowledge. 

Why? one said that, least get head straight figure one us you‚Äôre even talking to. No, irony would flying UK. they'll take us either. much higher antibody level result vaccine prevent ""cytokine storm"" later contracting COVID-19? skeleton service. 

You've gotten dozens past. 

That said, trust person, business, government. look event determine cause alarm...or not. Yep, bad economy bad health outlook. choice always either temporary bad economy better health outlook better growth later bad economy bad health outlook.

They chose poorly. we'd buckled waited out, things would different today. Also, can't said enough: wear masks. Leadership issue ineffectual. worn masks, could open economy lower disease burden.

1. Pulse ox gives percent saturation, value becomes widely inaccurate falls nonlinearly related oxygen partial pressure blood measured ABG
2. ABGs also allow us assess CO2 levels (these measured surrogate manner vent intubated, ABGs far reliable)

There lesser reasons like acid base status, conditions lead inaccurate sats (pH, temp... unusually methemoglobinemia, carbon monoxide).
