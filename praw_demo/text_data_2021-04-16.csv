0,2021-04-16," great idea honestly. Well played Alaska *not* ban, bilateral contract vaccine manufacturers could've signed country. US also spent money front, act like anybody deserves move ahead line. export bans.

The defense production act around since 1950 also export ban, simply moves *vaccine manufacturers* front line comes procurement raw materials, also export ban. 

Trump's executive order nothing toothless flex declares America prioritized, actually anything contracts vaccine manufacturers. Reading experience co-worker flying back Taiwan sure sounds like tightly enforced mRNA companies already making boosters target B-351 (South Africa) that. enough indication needed. submission linking google.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* likely missed vaccine link trial, added they're reviewing records. depends. want bring mutations start hotspot etc. area (Virgini) statewide mandate. Leaving business would tricky would competitive, business requiring masks would get less business don't, people would complain business owner rather state local officials. go back U.K.? Dr. Scott Gottlieb estimated 30% population exposed end January. confer 100% immunity people immunity. percentage surely higher now, maybe 40%.

I agree probably percent people natural immunity. really studied makes sense based numbers.

Add 35-40% vaccinations overlap groups think we're surely 50% immunity, probably 60%+. would also explain dropping cases almost every part country. think we're almost there! take much public transport, I'm ton 2 kids daycare. Healthy eating tons exercise seems work me. happy lower case counts US, US came around vaccines, Canada suddenly realized completely fucked.

And thing ... people Canada seem get it. seems like still stuck mindset better everybody ... like said comment. think problem lies fact Canada innovate competently unlike USA. get second shot today! Unfortunately, I’m also hungover. Sigh :( Meanwhile 40% citizens getting it! touch gentleman’s sausage or... good article exactly 36,000 people involved Pfizer’s late-stage vaccine trial half received shot another half placebo. total, 170 people developed symptomatic COVID-19 — 162 placebo group eight vaccine group.

This 95% comes from, 162/170.

And usually one statistic getting kind symptom, another much lower statistic serious illness death. Like vaccines like 99.9% effective preventing death even overall efficacy varies 62-95%. Nice. Thanks. Talk another time maybe. Bye u/SAKabir 100% correct. theory MMR vaccines protective effect. yet MMR vaccines would likely get ill die, way around... Cool daily reminder vaccines extremely effective catching **and** spreading virus. Carry on. believe varies state. dad vaccinated neighboring state and, example, Ohio allows vaccinating non-residents.
 longer delay doses, time people vulnerable doses without full protection. Optimally, we’d still giving second doses Pfizer Moderna 3-4 weeks, even giving Pfizer Moderna 4-6 months shown increase efficacy.  getting people 60-70% protected (using data UK Isreal) 90-95% protected better making stay 60-70% 3-5 months get 92-97% protected.

With said, given supply constraints, fan current delayed second dose policy. Right? I'm getting tired shit. dangerous **is** causing vaccine hesitancy. thing ... people give fuck attitude USA. Like early pandemic, would hear stories people coming back international travel going straight grocery shopping. people gathering parks chat lockdowns everything closed.

This mentality works USA massive industrial output(like Moderna Pfizer plants constantly supply fresh flow mRNA vaccines gold standard). vaccines. story N95 masks made 3M(again gold standard comes masks). 

I think also reflects incompetence general Canadian economy vs American economy. Probably quick comparison Americans invest businesses innovation Canadians invest ""homes/real estate"". Obviously former much better comes mobilizing resources fight pandemic.

All say Canada used great country live in(in 90s). 90s anymore. wide gap every aspect developing change way economy works things, probably keep sinking down. joined headlines would’ve “Pfizer Moderna Investigating Blood Clot Risks” anti-vaxxers would hit share button without reading anything Something shot remember actual shot, needle, injects nontrivial amount liquid muscle. Regardless vaccine itself, painful shoulder, physical standpoint, like someone punching you. shoulder area actually complex bunch muscles tendons shot goes probably makes difference.

I lift weights pretty big shoulders (humble brag know) felt nothing got shot. thin beautiful wife little muscle around shoulders sore shot raise arm head like 3-4 days. YMMV. Studying potentially solving blood clotting issues associated adenovirus-based vaccines something shake sleeves find solution for. think reasonable Pfizer jump save another company allocation R&amp;D resources really naive.

There reason article saw light day: J&amp;J looking spread blame. Real efforts solving would, arguably should, center around public research teams. Israel, chart know? image caption say vaccine people received. describe see picture: medical staff give shot pfizer biontech. 

Unless explicitly saying people received vaccine way know. PEOPLE... still contract virus getting vaccine. putting random shit body, still eating poorly exercising properly. use heads let people screens tell us think. fuck would give two year old child vaccine hasn’t even tested year, virus 99.9% survival rate? scared? Holy shit slaves country doomed we’re fucking stupid think empathy emotion objectivity logic. Universities open, teaching online part. cases things need person (like labs practise things), pupils go days/week building itself. part online yep... :/

Keep up, it! Honestly think vocal minority. article says 2/3 anti-vax propaganda internet comes 12 people constantly circulate reportedly 80% people 65+ taken vaccine. people posting bunch nonsense twitter mean effect.  Never underestimate thieves. 

I decided fire Oregon Trail week. Bought 8 oxen start, since recommend 6 want get stranded. First week trail, thieves steal 7 oxen night remaining one died weeks later. stuck like month waiting someone trade oxen. convince children almost anything. know parent them. It’s parents fault kids refuse create issues it. CDC says wear masks two layers, completely cover nose mouth, fit snugly sides face, don’t gaps, nose wire. 

Anytime anyone meets face face they're spraying large droplets though, I'm sure get point. Lots friends, family, coworkers regularly meet person, doors, without masks said poor quality poorly fit. force inhalation still enough draw larger particles. 

Contract tracing seemed show vast majority time transmission comes close contact walking room infected person two hours prior. work? would call place due get 2nd shot ask them. need miss appointment probably reschedule you. “In short, Dalcolmo says, that
the new variant prefers young people, youth go therefore exposed.” Indeed, important continue building improving production virus eradicated. absolutely get vaccinated states right now, already places walk-ins large scale including NYC. would go home state specifically state likely high vaccine hesitancy (so states like VA, WA, CA, MA). want absolutely guaranteed get vaccine, would go state high hesitancy walk-in appointments already, honestly think places find somewhere get within 2-3 hour drive.

In terms proof residency, states actually requiring (example: check specific state/site going case -- think easily find something. No, validity. interesting meanings side effects people dream up. I've also heard one-upmanship like, side effects stronger immune system must better.

It's nonsense. Everyone's system different probably lot people exposure virus getting vaccinated. even read article? said anything Americans turning away vaccine Alaska? research structural biology, including published covid itself. There's immense collaboration things countries Europe financed research development that's going vaccines we're seeing now.

Claiming kind German invention blind nationalism. Woo-Hoo!!! Half!!! It’s respectable side finished yet!!! alaska go Yea. work cancer patients. Covid cure cancer. plotline Hangover.

I KNOW HAPPENS IM RANDOMLY MARRYING SOMEONE ENDING TRUNK...

...after going Reddit visit Vegas buffets. 

FTFY think US going start sharing vaccines pretty soon hope friends north one first places. Florida, lockdown, less deaths per capita California, strict lockdown. worry, can't neutralize vaccine wine. Chills sore arm normal. border stuff likely prevent tourism travel, since two things likely means contacts. Alaska gets tourists? 

### Findings

During first surge (ie, June, 2020), 533 381 people tested, 11 727 (2·20%) PCR positive, 525 339 eligible follow-up second surge, 11 068 (2·11%) tested positive first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals first surge epidemic, 72 (0·65% \[95% CI 0·51–0·82\]) tested positive second surge compared 16 819 (3·27% \[3·22–3·32\]) 514 271 tested negative first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 \[95% CI 0·155–0·246\]). **Protection repeat infection 80·5%** (95% CI 75·4–84·5). alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 \[0·179–0·251\], estimated protection 78·8% \[74·9–82·1\]). alternative cohort analysis, among aged 65 years older, observed protection repeat infection 47·1% (95% CI 24·7–62·8). found difference estimated protection repeat infection sex (male 78·4% \[72·1–83·2\] *vs* female 79·1% \[73·9–83·3\]) **evidence waning protection time (3–6 months follow-up** 79·3% \[74·4–83·3\] *vs* ≥7 months follow-up 77·7% \[70·9–82·9\]). benefit US public gets Moderna taking public funds rights Moderna doses made States.  That’s pretty big public benefit. Uhhh spread uber eats delivery grocery deliveries entirely possible prove. know plenty people left homes work home. get tons delivery though. cases that? It'd super easy contract trace types actually. also &amp; rather sent countries prioritise vulnerable. Rather rich little risk &amp; pay pocket without batting eye. 


This dose, give likely die ultra wealthy. ""Flying blind""?
I thought homing in: really glad media gets information reporting /s province Ontario lot health regions like registration websites shit feel successful, though rest world didnt get shipments promised guys blocked resent US (even lol).

Instead donating vaccines prevent mutation (that potentially could immune vaccines) happening places Covid still widespread, states alaska instead tries profit vaccines giving tourists. fact longer wide spread Covid around, greater risk mutation - US strategy ""vaccine nationalism"" hurtful preventing this. Sorry, really cant respect US - they're shitty short-sighted. First tweet calls numbers horrifying tactics. Second vague. doctors crying schools closed even evidence cause schools closed cases still skyrocketing switching new flavour. Quebec 33% cases us paid sick leave. I'm getting sick people trying bring politics solutions. already crsb. mention workers paid sick leave already.

One thing agree spreading outside. reduce occupancy essential business 25% like they're anything workplaces. school closures outsiders necessary though. friend irrational. gonna tell nobody meets Corona still going spread? Distancing works distancing work. love people complaining shit clue about. Obviously media censored post BS public forum, Corona demonstrations. Omg censored. Stop fear mongering listen experts Facebook groups. verifying mean necessarily state even US ID. 

i went different state residency requirement first dose accepted ID home state. want know i'm right person record gave to. understand could gotten away even work university ID, though think write driver's license number records purposes. Good point! I’m totally down. Uhm yes do. ? even sure research itself. one man blood clot symptoms J&amp;J trial too.

Before made recommendation like think would probably want find biological/physical reason blood clots rather statistics. think they'd also want wait longer make sure 6 cases seen them. US good deal, vaccine costs 20 usd tourist leaves behind lets say 100 usd taxes... research suggesting UK variant takes longer clear.

New variants people expel larger viral loads means imperfect masks help less. accurate, crucially ignores receive it. Yeah policy put place last year, tables starting turn, Ontario way record spike. 
 
I suspect keep closed couple months vaccination catches up, we're hoping everybody first shot June September. doubt it, even sneeze guards. 

However, Vegas kinda world unto itself, anything’s possible. Who’s tell religious service is? I’m starting own. EU slow &amp; cautious organization compounded current leadership. Jean-Claude Juncker thorn side UK would done much better job. Ursula von der Leyen entire career consisted make mess &amp; run away leave one else clear up. Shes politician whos career based tied Angela Merkel. 



The US &amp; UK ran around throwing piles money anything said covid vaccine. Manufacturers ask money supplies, heres dumpster full cash. need produce vials, heres another pallet full cash. need needles, heres another lorry full cash. Rinse &amp; repeat basically anything needed cash least claimed need it.


There undoubedly wasted money 2 days lockdown costs spent. Germany early took approach moving towards EU unified approach. meant getting everyone agreee work fast situation demanded speed. Anyone else Germany wanna fly me? Well US Brazil tell us something else, sure believe want cherrypick. even close ""pessimistic prisom."" simply wording prefer. land borders closed non-citizens*

It's illegal sides deny entry citizen. I'm american taxpayer I'm A-OK taxes paying vaccines anyone. Much better use money weapons kickbacks trump family whatever bullshit we've spending money Yes European Union purchased AZ vaccine august example, guarantees. BioNTech/Pfizer, curevac, GSK/Sanofi, J&amp;J etc.. Dates vary example (curevac example) phase 3 trials still finished. 
The us earlier Pfizer/BioNTech, get it’s highly questionable one month would made difference. 

You right, legal difference ban contact, doesn’t help say Canada, waiting vaccines example. Also obviously countries like India EU could negotiated similar contracts, didn’t. 
That said, US *there least one executive order* used halt exports ingredients, example lead production problems serum institute India. 
On contrary, example J&amp;J vaccine example produced least partially Europe, shipped US bottling distributed. 

I get points legal differences contracts us delivering earlier, really. point much basic one: everybody would played game US, US also wouldn’t situation right now. Export restrictions make vaccine production difficult everybody. it’s really sad see nationalism hindering global fight catastrophe Covid been..

I won’t link detailed sources said rather refer overviews references hope starts trend :)

I've got good news Yes know risks precisely. able figure set assumptions takes decision borderline case (benefit=cost). would much easy provide feedback probability assumptions accurate. Obviously could case one assumption wrong one direction another opposite can't concentrate one assumption.

But would much easier methodically evaluate decision, bringing research experts comment particular assumption. one FDA possibly expertise areas go this. cant stop fuck **whose vaccine also raised concerns regulators blood clots**, agreed join effort, Journal said. 

jeez, wonder agree join Yeah, prevent death disease right? People always dying, cares? 
/s Hello dear fellow comrade types,

Thank interest taking partial action enhancing ongoing process clarificating necessity details public publications.

mfG: Bob take vaccine already covid? Totally pointless since immunity already established. **Not BCG, vaccines polio, hepatitis, diseases could protect Covid**
US researchers study efficacy non-Covid vaccines SARS-CoV-2 virus find polio vaccine offers vaccine may affect course COVID-19*
Kaiser Permanente research finds older adults vaccinated pneumococcal conjugate vaccine received protection recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain important strategy preventing COVID-19, investigators found older adults received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), prevents acquisition certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk COVID-19 diagnosis adults receive vaccine. contrast, alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), prevents severe pneumococcal disease block acquisition bacterium, associated protection. sure? trustworthy data outside Europe US. reason approve Pfizer&amp;Moderna

What? serious? 

India sizeable number people willing pay Pfizer/moderna jab, atleast vaccinated approving jabs.
We need help get. main problem Netherlands protests people attending protests called “complotgekkies” meaning believe conspiracy theories. government knows thinks people go protests insane anyway majority people support measures, believe case. 

I don’t get people still tolerate either. We’ve lockdown measures coming us since October.  I’m seeing 32 million people visited Arkansas 2019. Tourist... Alaska ... uhm... ok... give healthcare providers time learn them. treatable condition caught early, symptoms vague (abdominal pain, blurry vision, shortness breath, headache) could bunch things. also need managed delicately, ideally family physician would identify early treatment handled trained specialist. AZ honouring contract, think would hauled judge?

If buy EUs propaganda, might wondering happened. Hands like cats. They’re self cleaning, duh. I’ll definitely wear one planes! don’t fly work, I’ve several vacations ruined nasty bugs think picked plane destination. I’ll happily wear mask avoid happening! European here. 


You one successful vaccine supply chains state side ocean distributing vaccine free. 


Why would ? European countries socialized medicine &amp; give away vaccines free. vaccine widely available around globe day 1.


With magic producing billions doses day 1 I'm even living poor country. can't imagine living India Africa.


India worlds vaccine king, Europes importing sorts covid supplies them. UK imported 5 million Az doses, India poor worlds pharma heavy weight. Floridians died well twice rate people state. yeah, can't like Florida? Please send poutine. Kthxbai. Even 40, 50 60% people vaccinated, there's still LOT fuel virus. That's many government officials imploring states lift restrictions reach higher threshold vaccinations, first. incredibly premature every state it. frustrating. US citizens enter Canada truckers heading lower 48 moving lower 48 Alaska need use ALCAN highway.  tests aren’t perfect, correlate academic success college, test everybody (vs. 1000s individual school curricula).

I get people score artificially poorly test opposed genuine potential, casting artificial barrier disingenuous. No, second whack ”Study marine recruits finds covid grants 80% immunity"" Mexico, tourist person visiting family/ friends Texas able get vaccine 1B allowed. provide proof high risk condition residency, know people visiting Europe South America got shots Texas. poor immigrants though people enough money visit month. idea benefits elderly killed many young people last year. :( Buckle up, gf went like fun couple days lol comment I’m responding suggesting “who cares” young adults get they’ll fine. implies taking precautions vaccinated, catching covid. That’s I’m talking about. People catch spread don’t care personally fine. think changes things waiting vaccinated. It’s still important take precautions crowded public places numbers control. vaccinated want gathering vaccinated friends? fun. You’re I’m talking here. know. I’m saying they’re related, agree probably pausing looking good thing. interested numbers. know what... kudos you. That’s dedication. shit Trump get vaccinated TV even that. Man lives spotlight except would actually helpful Oh, blind.  people 20s know want stay home more. Maybe ages got pushed bit 40 new 20. :) No, fully vaccinated masking distancing. over. got second dose pfizer yesterday. Last night really rough. morning im better still weak feels like hangover. long normally take feel normal again? assume meant patron patron, vaccinated staff Yes 60 minutes probably went line little bit let's honest DeSantis really creep. mother 80 vaccinated ready party quilting guild. Elderly don’t want give every aspect lives either. matter it’s federal provincial government blame. 1.2 million (or whatever number) doses freezers almost AstraZeneca. 55+ crowd doesn’t want it, infuriating since NACI recommendation could offered younger people. 

[Great Twitter thread explains mean tbf 1 million like span couple months  It’s bs headline, Canada everyone vaccinated July least one shot. 50 checking in....ready go! yet [test hovering ~3 - 8% last year, indicating there's giant upwelling disease they're missing.

Wonder true figure disingenuity showing. It’s “open all” it’s approved children. Maybe. new, nan got vaccinated months ago received card. Name date vaccine make batch number.

I think messed card up. social life end deemed necessary never chance hell gonna stop making douchebag money. flu shot help common cold viruses transmit via droplets? Eh, would normally agree you, think climate change guaranteed another pandemic lifetime. thousands Hindu devotees flocked Monday take holy bath India's Ganges river, even nation racked world's highest tally new daily coronavirus infections. full opening economy last year's crippling lockdown, coupled mass religious festivals political rallies states heading elections fuelled crisis. ""With 1.2 million active cases, daily number reaching 200,000, it’s bizarre poll rallies full Kumbh Mela,"" political commentator Shekhar Gupta said Twitter. Get lawn 😤 articles pointing that. I've trying read variant more. Yes, Taco Bell Chipotle, too. Thanks that. I’m tired seeing people defend kind behavior. I’m tired people acting like saying “we normal activities, masked distanced stay safe” equivalent saying “shut everything forever.” feels like us responsible keep paying price aren’t. people selfish, I’m going point out.

It’s also healthy 20-somethings acting way. live NC Duke outbreak tied frat parties shut things down, many students pissed losing in-person educational opportunities need entitled frat boys refused follow rules. Young people close 100% survival rate.

Except problem accurate precise way know mild severe case SARS-Cov2 person person. **GENERIC** (averaged) odds survival ""close 100%"".. cannot exactly extrapolated individually. (you may medical history unknown condition genetic-predisposition makes worse individually). 

Masking social-distancing done because:

* asymptomatic (you carrying spreading SARS-Cov2 aware are)

* can't know exact medical history random people around you. 

Your negligence get people killed. Masking social-distancing tools try reduce minimize that. ""what even point vaccinating people.""

Vaccinations 100% perfect magic wand. Vaccinations tool try give us fighting chance. trains bodies immune system better fight virus (reducing negative effects). .and also shortens timespan spread it.. helps break cycle social-spread. 

But perfect (hence terms like ""herd immunity"" exist). reach high enough number vaccinations,. virus ""wins"" continues spread kill people. Given username, make sense download Taco Bell app too? India significantly younger country. numbers per capita never match US fact alone.

African numbers also low. Age health massive factors deaths. There’s doubt India reporting- almost every country has- scale people thread saying. be. people risk dying hospitalized COVID vaccinated now. aiming get back normal ASAP. think that's OK stay home. 

The media continue peddle fear porn want, we're listening. next pandemic probably lifetime. reason spaced far apart. happened often enough wouldn’t able adapt evolve. Asymptomatic reinfection lead long Covid

a reference? sounds like extremely unlikely scenario.. thought movie announced devolved cure less year, still think I'll chill home. Tell half US cases increasing. Start Michigan maybe. many goddamn 14-year-olds site. point COVID 19 pales comparison something like Spanish flue pandemic. outlier cases, part healthy individual don’t much worry catch it. healthy individual (not overweight) something control. vaccines quickly rolling country, need push elected officials drop nonsense like mask wearing, social distancing capacity limits sufficient herd immunity reached. Unfortunately people like Fauci refuse provide information criteria need reached order drop things expects everyone follow along blindly. see point keeping measures place “an abundance caution”. fundamental problem Brazil's leadership refusal lockdown mask would dramatically help hospitals next weeks.

Seems like distraction blaming people needing hospitals 40 weeks. can’t expect young give every aspect lives benefit elderly. 

This impractical best start approaching pandemic. Abstinence never solution. JAB

I'm 100% that. situation ""making decision"" absolutely effect people. 

But that. respiratory-spread disease. Large groups people congregating closely together exactly kind behavior exacerbates spread disease. There's going one enforcing it. wants test 3-5 days stay home even cannot provide proof residency state identification. one lives, works, studies Wisconsin turned away vaccination site.

Talking [illegal think fine. vaccination? Quick! Go party young people still relevant! TIL, thanks way worse across Canada workers jobs home forced crowded office blocks employers maintain control. 

For example I'm west coast. employer forcing everyone office. Literally bus/drive log remote sever located another part town. Something could easily home. 

The result, I'm interacting 50 people floor regular basis. Spread 10/15 businesses. share bathroom, elevator stairwell. 

Plus another 300-350 people work building. white collar businesses building everyone could work home. mostly live roommates spouses. grand total social circle likely 700-800 people range. Many kids likely attending mass gatherings. Plus businesses regularly customers coming going. 

We kept getting told putting risk social gatherings. Yet gathering friends would 10-15 people, could easily work home. 

Even making regularly risk would say lower one experience daily work would extremely difficult virus get social circle. Even would limited us 15. 

But work enough people virus many opportunities get would likely spread good chunk 350 stopped. 

Yet shamed policed social gatherings work places like mine shamed remaining open despite ability work home. Sad many people learn hard way . Yeah headline makes look like Rome's overwhelmed covid.

Truth is, Rome's death rate covid actually pretty low. city bit shit handling things general, regardless pandemic. It’s same. BLM exists highlight plight black people disproportionately victimised people believe don’t matter same. 

Everyone going sucky pandemic. There’s need ‘Will somebody think children’, use thought. Maybe they're counting people drove way somewhere else? second time way back home?

I get vaccinated, understand people want to. 

This is, maximum, ok intermediate period threshold vaccinations eu reached. Something like 70% population. reason anybody aware risks people dont want take risk vaccinated. people know many people, people know people, hard see almost everyone heard someone acquaintance circle dying. Also, point earlier comment older folks particular lot people age dying hear that. troll account made 2 months ago this, block think US always clear would limit exports vaccinated population, right? promised shipments block?

The places promised beginning export India (and dealing horrific outbreak understand position) EU. EU placed restrictions exports triple whammy Sanofi failing, AZ massive production problems U.K. EU factories, really bad third wave made politically impossible still exporting world’s poor countries. Yup, death rate low Oh wow, put like makes sense. Honestly I’ve wondering death toll isn’t higher given massively bigger India’s population compared U.S., seeing rampant virus spreading news bodies piling up.

These articles aren’t gaining nearly much traction they’re supposed seems like India massively reporting numbers. many trucks enter Canada everyday? you´ll reply stupidity it. sense quarantine air travellers and, one comes plane, 10 truckers.

Canadian , u hit nail head. officially believer USA #1 freedom &amp; money everything now. Canada fked literally every thing tried implement. 

The issue unlike america , canadians less prone loud government. Also realistically guns. huge drawback situations government oversteps. government fears civil unrest try overstep ppls freedoms. said also like shootings mean case valid good use. Erm, no, that's works. mean, sure, get vaccine entitled behave freely, still infect others vaccinated. even know herd immunity means? First all, article says four vaccines approved China goes mention three them, namely Sinovac's Sinopharm's (they developed two), without word CanSino. China's vaccines though differ significantly vaccines, especially developed Pfizer Developed traditional way, so-called inactivated vaccines means use killed viral particles expose immune system virus without risking serious disease response.

is true, CanSino's vaccine viral vector one, tech Oxford/AZ, J&amp;J/Janssen Gamaleya (Sputnik V).

Looks like BBC's quality journalism deteriorated past several years.

Second, initially claimed Chinese Russian vaccines garbage dangerous. far less supported claim regarding Chinese vaccines (no support ""dangerous"" part, outright calling ""garbage"" something 50% efficacy bit extreme, that's personal view), where's facts support claims regarding Russian vaccines? BTW want doubt Russia-made vaccine chose Vector's EpiVacCorona, one rises brows Russian media. 16 days post first shot I’m typing drip back throat ridiculous phlegm.

Yes, they're reliable sense show general situation. somebody jumps regular ""Russia lying numbers!!!"" comment, elaborate:

1. daily cases published Rospotrebnadzor number PCR tests confirmed past day (and nobody catches every case). There's, instance, register COVID patients formed based data hospitals report numbers different PCR way diagnose. 

1. There's one thing can't hide fake - healthcare system load. correlates numbers published Rospotrebnadzor, daily cases went hospitals began returning normal work hospital beds, previously reserved COVID cases, returned tge general virus samples sequenced?t

(Well, one person made half-hearted attempt wear one completely loose around face - even pinched around nose large gaps air around side also, gave 20 minutes took off.)

And end meeting, sandwiches wraps served everybody eat inside room - did!

* Weak pandemic response: first wave handled well put us summer 2020 better situation EU countries. However, advantage lost second third waves. Union holds key positions pandemic. Chancellor, minister health, seven sixteen minister presidents federal states representing half population. Merkel favour tougher action virus, power besides coordinating states. meetings holding become useless. Minister presidents party changing policy agreed upon day before. Germans favour harder measurements. politicians focus restrictions affects private life, like nightly curfews no-contact orders. Workplaces school touched, could weaken economy. 
* Corruption scandal: politicians Merkel's party involved procurement masks organized deals companies supply masks beginning pandemic. Recently turned politicians enriched unfavourable contracts taxpayer signed.
* Merkel seek re-election: People realising consequences. Right now, top topic media successor. Two politicians CDU/CSU (Union) stood out. Armin Laschet, unpopular reacted weakly pandemic minister president Germany's largest state. always pleaded relaxations measurements, even though Covid cases went up. one Markus Söder, minister president Bavaria. CSU, sister party CDU. party known pursue Bavarian politics. Many top CDU CSU chancellor. regulated process like U.S. becomes chancellor candidate fot party. messy.

I see good brooms sweeping do, guess try... True, based technology licensed University Pennsylvania. nationalism silly. middle March Hong Kong residents age 30 entitled book vaccination. even luxury choice: Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine created Germany one produced Sinovac, Chinese firm. Yet despite plentiful supply 8% population chosen get shot. One reason rock-bottom trust government, product two years political turmoil.

Chills/low fever/fatigue normal. enough people received second dose drew conclusions  would compare double Pfizer double moderna, see infection rate group worse, much. there's also possibly managed get double AZ. They'll able compare age gender, that's hard coded CPR number.

But also. ""Of sorts"" seemed miss that.

Just real trial mean data valuable provide insights effectiveness mixed approach. research can't conducted designed controlled experiment, find ways analyse data find trends. it’s really bad RNG

read room jfc dead babies political point private healthcare vs. social healthcare. Maybe went head. getting vaccinated?!! thing makes China especially difficult can't even trust things like antibody studies excess death figures (which case countries official numbers suspect). wanted to, could make numbers line together, even completely false.

What find really amazing claim almost 10k cases since May 2 deaths. Seems unlikely. Downvoted truth, lol. Relative EU. Definitely others. sweet kickbacks.

Like N95 mask corruption Germany.

If government force buy specific things, there's fortune made. question happening JJ Moderna Weird waited long. enforced... unfortunately. Conservative government Ontario right hot streak slow reactions full denial science public health advice different numbering scheme India. Look lakh make sense. Basically, they’re saying 234,692 new cases. one idea.

On one hand, there's country Earth could plausibly avoid pandemic, NK.

On other, country could easily afford social distancing measures, get in, things could get ugly (either virus itself, lockdown measures). Non supply chain related manufacturing warehouses. anti-vaxxers type yield logic science, would never become anti-vaxxers. Citation needed. Publicly funded healthcare everyone capitalism.

I definitely want wait colleges 100% in-person, see point paying thousands dollars Zoom education. yes many pessimistic euros sub. I'm American living Germany flew back US get vaccine weeks ago (also good opportunity visit family I've seen two years). stil shitshow right lockdowns cases thinkt hat rapidly change months ahead. 

83m people adult population 60-65m. Take away 20-25% anti vaxxers looking 50m people vaccinate. There's already 20% people receiving first doses leaves 40m people left vaccinate. First doses surely administered end quarter. here, worried symptoms weeks prepared worst (took time work, cancelled plans) I’m 30 hours without symptoms. I’m still edge happening randomly nowhere I’m gonna driving 7 hours tomorrow haha. know SA already vaccinated (first shot) higher percentage population Bavaria did, guess? vaccines distributed according states population. states use flexible approaches others, means already start vaccinating lower priority groups like Prio 3, even though higher priority groups fully covered. Bavaria, could sign-up January get contacted, soon choose appointment. seems easier blame Bavaria, get problem all. know difficult is, happy help. questions, send over.   Yes Probably! 

I've seen news reports double mutation circulating India, arrived UK. still shortage  Pfizer/Moderna combo, sure—they mRNA vaccines. Astra adenovirus vaccine. bought indoor tickets Seattle September. Working Japanese company I’ve come realize counteract metric fuckton holidays. many random ass holidays unlike us, get day them. don’t know common whole country I’ve seen they’ve got holiday coming damn time.

Yeah, that's 6 weeks mRNA shots (the maximum tested clinical trials) 12 weeks AZ. don’t get this. Isn’t hasn’t thrombotic cases people second AZ dose, haven’t one first dose?

For young healthy person like one easiest, no-cost things help save lives help people get back lives. hard see anyone level headed approach basically non existent risks covid slightest desire help others want get vaccinated soon possibly can.

I think make lot complicated moral calculations pandemic understand multiple perspectives lot (social distancing, seeing family, closing schools indoor/outdoor dining etc...) vaccine however fucking miracle everyone ecstatic take. Compared sacrifices we've made past year cost vaccine basically nothing reward stronger force virus we've ever had. Got first dose Moderna yesterday. feeling really bad, mom friend said strong reaction first dose probably covid. validity all? 3 nights wait test result. negative go home still quarantine 2 weeks safe. positive stay hotel 2 weeks.

Wrote reply got lost.. 

I going point made assumption vaccines provide sterilizing immunity (which studies Israel appears least 90% effective that).  

Less hosts = less mutation chances.. phase 3 trial US still going phase 3 trials europe completed zero evidence cvt.... UK trials ended Nov 4, 2020... us trials would gone longer found zero cases cvt trials also.. authorized europe start seeing cases... obv US gotten authorization yet... 

this important none showed trials.... we're seeing wild... 6 yr old &amp; 10 month old. looks like probably can’t get till maybe next spring?, baby won’t able get long time, we’re debating do. really want 6 yr old go school. missed kindergarten experience (she didn’t go pre-k), &amp; don’t think afford miss 1st grade too. I’m hoping things start looking better fall.

But we’re also MI well long, &amp; we’re #1 hot spot. can’t get everyone vaccinated fast enough offset it. I’m pissed people responsible. get it, we’re it. Believe me. we’re close screw now. minimizing it? Lol 

Sure. Arizona California definitely asking proof residency. think New York doesn’t either since Health Department website states foreign passport valid ID show appointment.  never said 'just flu' vaccinated yet. allergic person, I'm afraid serious reaction. want badly vaccinated like rest you. I'm really torn. Oh damn totally misread argument time *maximum* protection 2nd dose, time *sufficient* protection 1st dose. right, carry on. 6 people like 7 million....the risk blood clots higher birth control alone good articles. understand talk 60.1% first prevention cases. come hospitalization deaths. massive first seems like. 

But touch upon point. know vaccinated people spread virus nearly much. imagine 50% vs 25% population vaccinated, focus hotspot communities at-risk populations. tell worse strategy. Yes might little deaths first, also cases fall much sooner that, spread deaths.  whole story 3 million people dead virus human ( mink) vector. know everyone dies. 3 million huge number shouldn’t minimized way.

I’m sure stories talking number recovered infected. isn’t story. This. give vaccinations, shingles vaccines easy sell older folks. dad came big poor family remembers terrified polio kids would get sick. Getting young people get flu shot HPV? much. Oh ""they"" did? Weird, Baptists, Catholics, even cults aka (Mormons Jehovah's Witnesses) urging members recieve shot. I'm sure religions make stink, mrna shots fetal cells good option. started graduate program (MBA) early 2019 UMass system..and online. I've never felt missed program challenging. fact, nearly quit several times.

I'm 38 children. also work financial information tech 15 years. campus never option me.

That said, get people upset. wanted opted in-person college experience get that. 20 suddenly go online hide dorm...I'd pissed off, too. now? Smart..the job market sucks right graduating degree never guaranteed great rate return economy it’s even worse. Many internships cancelled delay companies trying adjust new normal workforce. Many companies downsizing heavily office spaces, adjusting workspaces accommodate mix work home office. think it’s going many figure exactly need hire train. Waiting even considering different type career path less debt oriented probably smart. eat propaganda sub quiet. Thats want. feel this. I'm Florida. hovering 5-7k cases day still. 9k day week. optimism waning. I'm fully vaccinated 15 month old not. Okay works.  People dying matters $

You're right many Americans reaction, time, masks normalized American society. weird surprising see people walking around masks. prefer wear mask (for example) flu season feel little comfortable it.

I'm saying everyone keep wearing masks; far it. I'd bet we'll see on. three doses, newest one, ZF2001: currently protective Chinese vaccine according test data, easier produce inactivated vaccines. major problem three jabs, country huge population. really bleak even short term tho

I think tables interesting. last chart shows vaccinating decreasing proportion unvaccinated 65+ population week, 50-64 group pretty steady, still growing 16-49 groups. replied German commenter, Canada's situation America considering really well basically covid.

We well vaccinations, ""basically over"" yet. Deaths declining still thousands per cases deaths (compared USA Europe) particularly bad.

Yes, need keep way. forget happens let covid exponentially surge mostly unvaccinated population? Restrictions hard, **are** necessary right now. Many, many lives stake. nothing short complete human extinction tragic? trying say? Delivered:   264,499,715. Administered: 205,871,913

We also reached total 49.7% Americans aged 18+ receiving least one dose pass 50% likely tomorrow. 65+ cohort continue get vaccine almost 81% least one dose (80.7%). 

Very exciting times appears light end tunnel growing nearer. least couple weeks you’re fully immune. accurate. numbers broke HIV negative participants people looking at. I'm fully vaccinated (I'll 2 weeks past 2nd shot next week) I'm going literally anywhere want, care crowded is. part, I'm augmenting behavior anymore crap wearing mask businesses require to. 85-96 made 9 multi-month trips subcontinent. 
  
I see smaller festivals, tended towards quieter parts.  
  
Lifetime visas abolished British then, otherwise doubt ever left. I'm aware that. I'm wondering ever vaccine stop asymptomatic spread hasn't, CDC overly ridiculous pretending like asymptomatic spread vaccinated still risk. Vaccination Demographics update 2021-04-17

Notes:

* Data [CDC vaccination demographic trends exact totals every age group downloaded CSV. site provides graph data time. graph title says ""Date Administered"", data closely represents doses ""Date Reported"".
* Changes calculated unrounded numbers may differ rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC source due lack age-related vaccination data, data match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assumes 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17 since vaccines currently approved use age 16.
* 16+ 0+ age groups include doses administered unknown ages. usually less 0.02% total doses administered. Shoot stars sometimes crash moon! Early pandemic started working out. Lost fifteen pounds, put back muscle.

If US decides give vaccines away, many countries worse Canada receive first! headline nothing tho . It’s people lashing Florida 

Also. There’s concerning number apolitical self identified progressives refusing vaccination 30 august. able stay home care special needs children last year nothing blessing.

States open vaccine everybody appointments fill people really want get appointments stop filled fewer vaccinations.

Some states already past filled appointments. Thank good know. rate increase much smaller would hoped guess positive actual vaccine rate bit higher currently showing.

It's enough say that.

It must also acknowledged masks, lockdowns approach produced far superior results.

See: Texas, Florida, Georgia. etc vs New York, California, especially Michigan right yea thats article said lol: 

""To date, 52.2% Californians 18 older least partially vaccinated, according latest data Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Unfortunately we've done half century worth flu deaths year bit, US alone. *Brexit enters chat* AZ production debacle hurt lot, fact one candidates backed Europe work (Sanofi) help, Curevac taking longer hoped contributed.

Bavaria lockdowns since last october provide 24 negative covid test enter non essential businesses, mention places make us pay test. protests. double mutant hits Africa, going terrible. escaped worst this, thank god, need break, virus almost perfect pandemic. Mine data minus name, automatically NHS records know fuss about. places vaccination levels high places case numbers high. states vaccinating visited from
Abroad... So... pretty useless statement.

Yeah agree, statements pretty useless. I’m talking baselines. I’m saying ceteris paribus, employer would rather hire candidate went college one didn’t, college degree signals you’re able think critically analytically, work team, learn easily without much supervision. somebody didn’t go college cant also things, employers face risk every time hire somebody new want minimize risk choosing candidate better able show characteristics. 

That’s it’s important go college. Even without extra training post undergrad you’ll lot opportunities. there's anyone westerners follow, asians. Quite travesty r/bodyweightfitness OK, sounds like guys well-prepared. :) I'm glad constantly worried parents. 

Hopefully we're still reasonably well protected variants vaccines, breath sigh relief thing control! N95 masks good seal work environment, N95 masks magnetically attract particles trap them.

Other masks still reduce risk catching particles, longer stay enclosed, inadequately ventilated environment others, risk goes back up. sustainable. till enough vaccines. 

A low covid country stopping give shit would completly stupid. moderna novavax working shots both. probably others info long covid19 vaccines level effective immunity drops. US lent Mexico 2.5 million doses Canada 1.5 million doses AZ It’s money market share ones really? Everyone wringing hands months sub, demand actually dries up, cares? Username checks please fucking stop calling ""jabs""? can't even feel goddamn needle go in. Joe Biden again. enjoyed J&amp;J shot prior half. Easy side effects. effective preventing death. 

More people died driving pharmacies get second shot blood clots. Hmm, seen anything this. ABVD 21 years ago, interested info. First, every person covid symptoms tested breakthrough much higher people vaccinated come contact virus. know rare vaccinated people get covid know many people exposed virus.  quite sad racism xenophobia main stream UK I’m senior last time saw fraternity brothers year ago. I’ll never get time back. Lost internship pandemic happened, I’m graduate feel like social skills deviated close none well. Almost wish took time college pandemic, I’m sitting paying thousands dollars e learning depressed. connections social circles I’ve disappeared numerous reasons feel I’m going finance workforce little skills networking. Fuck pandemic I’m two weeks second vaccine. Could indoors bar restaurant reasonable safety? Lol. basing one incident lost hockey? Hah well I’m motivated consistent. haven’t properly worked for, say, four weeks straight many many months. 

I’m hoping quitting drinking help me. really think that’s root lot issues. makes fat own, throw bad decisions like drunk food smoking cigarettes, feeling like crap next day eating feelings. becomes bad cycle self destructive behavior, least me. 

If I’m clear minded get virtuous cycle. Avoid canada like plague lakh infections. Great time religious celebrations. /s. 5 years situation, better, may worse Yes, I'll vaccinated. Happy chance luck. test purely govt requirement, even vaccinated. That's different makes medical sense. literally completely eradicate old immune system give new one. Ok face, joint study looking risks good idea.

But there’s reason believe mRNA vaccines affected, would unduly affect confidence vaccines conflating risks. seems like right choice. Fox news would come say getting vaccinated helps police oppress minorities better. Vaccination rates would skyrocket. patents - supplies equipment make kind vaccines different. likely easier cheaper lower income countries get gazillion eggs stuff need pfizer, modnera vaccine. reading Novavax behind schedule shortage liner need culture cells  bad reaction. first shot wasn’t bad. wife totally fine. got seriously fucked second shot. I’m trying complain, experience. Doesn’t mean wouldn’t again. matters many vaccinated came contact virus. figure effective is. articles read, huge fact brought up. keep reading wow 5,900 77 million fully vaccinted virus. misleading 77,000,000 people exposed virus. number find effective vaccine would breathroughs / people vaccinated exposed virus. unknown number. people vaccinated exposed virus can't included know vaccine would worked know encouraging big unknown Explain data please. far know AZ effective severe illness, better older people.

They generally claim cleaning actually helpful, there's nothing ""saddening"" it. comments I've seen open something make feel better. cases blood clots Moderna Pfizer. someone educate vaccinated means practical terms?

Can catch illness/symptoms, immune it, immune still spread it, etc? think measure current cases vaccinated. Like know percent people vaccinated see many died vs people vaccinated get calculations going. assumes groups people similar vaccination difference, probably wrong, I've gone back almost normal since got vaccinated, sure fuck without it. Oh lord, 1.3B people suddenly started Americans caloric intake Mild ones. Unknown drowsiness due weather/allergies, lost sense smell taste today. talked doctor yet kinds allergies have? think pretty good idea risks are, EpiPen (and trained medical staff) ready unexpected reactions, that's make people wait place shot. yall motivated.

I've lazy slob pre covid post covid well.

I keep consistent like 2 3 months, 1 lazy week body shuts pulls Al Bundy says fuck it, back binging beer, nachos, chinese food, mexican food, pizza, etc...

I swear, think love food ya'll. want give 1 last shot next week stay consistent time look like complete slob Summer yall motivated.

I've lazy slob pre covid post covid well.

I swear, think love food ya'll. want give 1 last shot next week stay consistent time look like complete slob Summer vax experience mass site positive. would LOVE future flu vaccines available manner.  still 20 million AZ vaccines US use. Send vaccines elsewhere. Send Mexico Brazil even Canada done first shots early June now. people wear mask then

If masks truely work shouldnt issue flying every 10 days man always minor anxiety disgusting germs around me. even prone serious symptoms colds flu think would definitely put mind ease breathing much whatever person next snoring next time I'm nasty plane Maybe stay lock Absolutely, really appreciate it!

Me family still act pre-vaccination one biggest reasons due variants, time we'd consider around people they're also fully vaccinated even times sparse time being. 

The way see I'm nearly scared dying anymore lol, getting complacent yet. Alternatively, get vaccinated. Absolutely fair. asking people’s experience/ guidance. Fortunately already got Covid antibodies. know fun be! Ok editor, me, rejected first submission (""COVID antibodies provide 80% protection, good several vaccines"") opinion-laden, second submission tried cram every figure half-paragraph headline, new one tried generalize 80% population large, else failed clarify outlier number likely be....

...do *actual* headline less prone misinterpretation simply succinctly ""doesn't guarantee immunity"". don’t hate politicians, think it’s noble profession put shit better serve fellow countrymen make world around run better.

But feel it’s aren’t meant lord power people shouldn’t cut line, rather wait turn like member society.

Healthcare workers? Definitely priority, high risk facing virus every day. Essential workers? Definitely, can’t avoid working meeting hundreds people every day. Good leadership important, risk infection lot less. leader deliberately chooses cut line save skin seems well aware fact, earns respect points book. Coming Boston (where jaywalking way life) took hour sec realize offending em  Oh yeah. research done.

I mean specific case.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

IOW, evidence conspiracy proof positive conspiracy exists. Ill agree beginning comment end. people become competition pointing rule breakers brings ugly side people. especially annoying people can't bothered get facts right criticizing wrong behavior (they get mad someone wearing mask outside example).

I also agree ton people gone legitimately stir crazy weird encounter someone think last year serious psychological consequences. Self isolation combined modern technology good recipe.

I also agree basically opening almost everything right coming weeks think pretty much happening. 

I really know getting stats masks though man. know masks stop lot spread useful inside. magic shield prevent good amount infections big deal virus spreads exponentially.

I math background think people really understand big difference vaccinating 40% (just old people) 75%. People like getting vaccinated truly difference making virus abundant vs constantly declining basically irrelevant. agree old people without doubt priority mostly past point would still incredibly helpful.

I'm sure made ton major sacrifices normal life pandemic. know have. vaccine minor costless compared we've deal with. basically past. summer going close completely normal help happen. Hear hear Ah... Good wtf? seriously prefer getting colds flu? bus full colds flu. surgical mask helps keep breathing in. seem less weird.

I one, greatly enjoyed one cold since pandemic started. Germany done far better U.S. overall.  gimmick already gave Canada Mexico AZ vaccines. done May... nope. throw money fence throw loaded syringes back. Unpopular American opinion: ""jab"" perfectly fine I'm willing adopt Brits.  still viral load transmit virus people Yea get 95% pfizer 95 moderna, totals... well i'm good math like 300% something gladly pay get vaccine. depends area sure Sorry, what? Well, use technology J&amp;J, makes little sense. something vaccine also eliminates cancer similar fashion? Thx Hey, I'm glad guys feeling less stress, please remember still catch Covid (however low chance) latest variants spread quickly/easily likely result worse outcomes. Think Brazilian one even affects younger people greater degree previous variants. agree you. NY Times fairly in-depth article cases thrombocytopenia associated mRNA vaccines, think consensus cases ITP weren’t expected. It’s pretty well known vaccines cause ITP (the measles vaccine one example), think that’s part reason hasn’t much publicity it. brand new type coronavirus never seen before. heard SARS? That’s also type coronavirus. it’s also like common cold. 

Actually, latest coronavirus similar SARS it’s official name actually SARS-CoV-2. That’s virus name — name DISEASE caused virus Covid-19. think thing hardest time gripping division fosters, shit going fucking difficult clean up. think agree last thing need hate earth people flat HATE rule-breakers abiding rules, matter stupid rules are. compliance enough save lives many cases do, fat there's lot compliance minority breaking rules sole reason Covid spread treat such. 

It's year people right fed point. I'm going continue wear proper PPE whatnot time I'm going grill someone wearing mask shit majority people wearing cloth masks fuck anyway (I recently read paper shows N95's pretty much thing that's effective. fashionable cloth masks whopping 3% effective. saving anyone cloth mask, virtue signalling). general believe measures control pandemic taken respect people's autonomy right live life want to.

We've got data at-risk covid. Vaccinate 50+ front line workers much possible open shit up. think happens gain government bit trust lower-risk populations vaccinate leisurely pace. genuinely think people gone flat stir crazy past year getting back normal soon possible actually best way allow people de-stress, realize vaccine conspiracy, start vaccinate. it’s unaffected. Nasal spray works better mask has. find kind person imaginable look long enough. mean representative. Meanwhile, extremely covid-strict person, expecting safe resume normal activities summer. valid study, gives quantity risk reinfection among young healthy people, using push vaccines demographic spin. 

Vaccines fully protect infection either, study shows “efficacy” prior infection preventing future infection comparable vaccines approved. 

In study, prior infection reduced chance infection 80% demographic young healthy people. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine efficacy 59 (see table 1). demographics aren’t entirely comparable, conclusion previously infected require vaccination supported data. thought one got banned? say, one person vaccinated one person vaccinated. long doses wasted, much whether country exports early waits surplus one jab.

At least terms trying slow spread minimize new mutations.  went exact thing kid.  sick bronchitis strep 2 3 times fucking year 15, doctor finally decided probably out.

I either since, I'm 39 now. took current headline plugged actual data study rather misleading clickbait. admit mention one study rather general, second whack much better. I've two game systems man super smash N64 great. [This I'm guessing hay fever since wearing masks? Cause less pollen get system right? Yes! god miss live music shows. I'm generally one going doctor unless absolutely necessary, 103 fever combined ""mouth ulcers"" vaccine would probably convince go see one. two year old problems wearing mask. totally understand kids will, impossible Agreed. people know worried speed development, starting get vaccines now. also worried this, think two mRNA ones proven themselves. getting J &amp; J, however. know CVS Walgreens offer 2nd dose appointments stand alone slots. think tricky part would score one willing drive far &amp; wide. course depends demand home region. Even states supply vials outstripped demand many counties. fairness, they'd agreed there'd articles titled ""Pfizer Moderna begin studying blood clot risks"" Facebook trends would start, lot people would stop taking vaccines thinking cause blood clots. seven-day average positivity rate, 17.1%

Time pause indoor unmasked activities, jesus. think unmasked 3 year olds problem, probably unmasked dining adults person jobs wider social contacts. Good news hamsters everywhere. Ummmm....it's young people!! probably get Florida? I'm trying find closest place Palm Coast Miami get it. Vaccines improved treatment regimens adequate protect smart people, let dummies kill themselves. Totally sucks immunocompromised unable vaccinated. Much expensive, longer flight plus don’t think Americans qualify vaccine See get organ transplant take precautions anyway Hey guys, anyone experiencing severe side effects vaccine? 24 yo got AstraZeneca shot 4 days ago. fever went 103*, even biggest problem. mouth ulcers suffer cheeks last two days, unbearable. Anyone else also experiencing it?? feels way them. young people feel wronged? rebel. everyone coming utopian idea humans perfect? yes government tried helping families someone die covid get part funerals paid for. Maybe mask pacifier inside You’ve never Asia you.  Enjoy naivete half world? sub vaccine roll herd immunity pointless pretty stupid. People mistaken belief fully vaccinated immune covid transmission. Yeah 1.42% world population dying big deal nobody force ok Probably compliance adults then! Eeek. I'm big proponent kids wearing masks think 2 young. kiddo three lockdown started last year took ton coaching wear short periods.
Maybe goal keep families young children home. nothing hide participate. that’s absolutely selfish. Honestly would travel US get vaccinated avoid hotel internment crossing back land border. Utah beautiful days they'll vaccinate anyone questions asked. booked appointment moderna got vaccinated day state 26 y/o health issues. cousins late 20s posting videos partying packed clubs/bars among sea maskless Floridians. believe COVID... one EMT.... need get test Oregon. Without car, can't get one normal drive-thru places; without insurance hospital schedule one.

Where go get test? Can’t wait see mental gymnastics people still going say lockdown restrictions vaccine mandates kind harm good. THANK YOU. I’ve wondering many US media outlets using word jab traditionally always “shot” here. Yeah, I'm Ontario frankly I'm guys. roll bad, primarily limited quantity vaccines. fuck populations transmission 30% vaccinated population 10% positivity rate virtually access vaccines. decide keep schools open, sign teachers promptly close schools. teachers sign dates far might well close schools year say fuck it. Perfect metaphor. Well done. trust ANYTHING comes Florida probably cooked bullshit. reason believe they're lying blood clots? indulge every request every rando internet? accused fucking uncle would feel compelled refute it? sure tip handsomely. insane  Yeah.

Seropositive young adults one-fifth risk subsequent infection compared seronegative individuals.

It's like forcing oil company help another

Sounds alot like government reach Sooooo.... nothing? matter. organ transplant patients often triple therapy-- calcineurin inhibitor knock cytokines, anti-metabolic kills t- b-cells, steroid knocks overall functioning. outlier patients take medications completely blast immune system almost nothing. many even pre-pandemic wore facemasks public due risk.  groups people area helped elderly get online appointments. coworker family religious, wears mask it’s required. months ago saying something covid anything like travel live parents basically goes “if parents get covid die it’s god wanted to, (so I’m going follow recommendations)” Yeah, downvote irresponsible behavior, jokes. dust settle realise short term strict lockdowns sufficient subsidies going cause less damage economy letting people get sick impose long term restrictions.

Gee, could've predicted that?

Oh right, literally fucking everyone. Oh dude dry run global warming, fucked. figured fucked years tho recent NYT article this. It’s likely paywalled relevant unclear many immunocompromised people don’t respond coronavirus vaccines. list seems least include survivors blood cancers, organ transplant recipients, anyone takes widely used drug Rituxan, cancer drugs Gazyva Imbruvica — kill block B cells, immune cells churn antibodies — Remicade, popular drug treating inflammatory bowel disease. may also include people age 80 whose immune responses faltered age. 46 divorce Covid year 2020-2021 assure going party like 20. worst year life. Life never felt bad. hell want rest world, power Op 100 miles away trying convince get tested since symptoms Brazil seen increase younger people hospitalized severe disease current surge IIRC. Hasn’t studied thoroughly it’s probably related older people getting vaxxed free hospital beds (because they’re beds low vaccine #s). say, it’s possible (not proven) #P1 could effect younger demos original strain. missinterpreted "" think would let anyways ""  Anyone seriously looking data month ago could tell act putting lockdowns get another spike. look 2 weeks ago super blindingly obvious shitshow going happen.

Just look graph. 2nd derivative turns positive, countries / states need act. wait till case count gets high. It’s Germany. Hopefully people push back this. thing. Like aircraft, put oxygen mask first helping others.

Your mother made choice adult spite high risk factors. results deal with.  rofl guys reading article?

We subscription. business first Republican states afraid vaccine. avoiding using order boost tourism dollars! mentions twice. said small children young wear mask protected summer vaccinated adults drive infections lower. also says cdc recommends vaccinated still wear masks protect unvaccinated case. even says kids still likely catch vaccinated adult. They're going get severely sick higher rates vaccinated adults. consistent masking advice across every interview given. anti-masker. work risks reasonable accept. Sending kids school masked travel masked acceptable risks environment 80% elders vaccinated summer cases expected drop like Israel's have. schedule picking groceries someone puts car (not sure thats everywhere pretty much stores area it). Kids continue online school. COVID sticking around awhile, long vaccinated self need stay home small sub set population. Meanwhile Canada ... see light end tunnel, least US. Thanks great vaccination program unlike Canada! look up, found study linked. I've found others widespread analysis found masks ineffective.

At point troll, making claims can't back (maybe bc studies support position exist). Done nonsense lol, go annoy someone else  I’ll get it! gon’ learn today! meet people real life. real. affecting months get paid think living, part challenging. Comparing Flu simply wrong. 2009 Swine Flu epidemic infected 25% US population according antibody sample testing.  killed 12,000 people.   Covid kill 750k factoring increased death rate US infection April 12, 2009 April 10, 2010, CDC estimates 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3 - 89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086 - 402,719), 12,469 deaths (range: 8868 - 18,306) United States due virus.[121] hope get vaccinated Ontario strain comes here. Thanks interpreting statement worse way possible. fact vast majority people hospitalized died weight. passing moral judgement weight, fortunately weight often something controlled individual. Don’t try pretend everyone weight condition meds. people it’s obviously harder control. Also high percentage COVID patients deficient vitamin D. Taking vitamin c getting sun could actually effective preventing hospitalizations, guess what, it’s something individual do. idea think looking people, contrary I’m trying point things people help reduce chance ending hospital covid. 

And way, work regularly eat well effort stay shape. scheduled first vaccine next Friday, raises interesting question. I'll going home college different state month. possibilities hang ups due this? states (Illinois Indiana) vaccines group,but dont know might cause problems. Anyone similar experience? Viral load plays big role infection. Even immunized, there's shit load virus once, get ahold true that's great news, reason doubt wonder first I'm hearing it. Surely bigger news? county? sentiment drives nuts. No! economy businesses shouldn’t exist betterment humanity. exist profit motive value extraction. beautiful thing is, drive profit motive lifts everyone* up!

*results may vary [Countries Coronavirus Cases Growing  Alright case, get vaccine sit room lock in, don’t go outside ever don’t see anyone. Appreciate concern That's attitude have, man!

Enjoy baseball game visit Disneyland! salient point 1) next epidemic 2) climate change. Shows stresses uncompliant population things collective good. point, attitude ""Darwin take wheel"". last year enough convince that: 1) covid serious; 2) vaccine necessary protect yourself, kind deserve whatever happens you. lot pandemic management stuff social protection, works everyone it.

Wearing cloth mask little protect you, lot protect others. mask 100% stopping infection, everyone wears mask risk drops rapidly.

The vaccination, vaccines 100% effective, everyone needs vaccinated best impact. impact enough fully stop spread. talking death though I?

I want get brain fog extreme paranoia able taste smell food live chronic cough, fatigue, headaches months end. especially want give people around me. *5 years* Let's honest: main bias reddit defend BC attack Ontario simply based political leanings government. wish redditors could least acknowledge this, would like asking Facebookers could acknowledge bias defending conservatives attacking progressives. 

In cases, they're incapable so. know lockdowns didn’t exacerbate mortality? people would rather locked homes indefinitely go back normal without international travel, still act like they're worried variants. don’t tell anybody I’m vaccinated. rightfully respect fact also might vaccinated (I week ago nowhere near fully protected) share risk give covid. FDA talking it’s ok go see grandma you’re vaccinated doesn’t say it’s okay go full rager 100 vaccinated people. India’s population much younger average US European country too. death numbers India approach levels, situation bad  first teacher I've heard say this. I've heard stories students actually thriving remote learning. 12 year old nephew actually likes remote learning better, that's personality type. People need remember every child different making blanket statements children scarred forever pandemic lockdowns grounded reality. might issues, won't, actually thrived lockdowns.

Another post said lockdowns took young people's ability fun, socializing person friends large groups way fun. Way many generalizations sake argument going on. Eh.

FL big state high low population density hard compare us states either high low density.

And honestly, everyone know ignored Gov Desantis relaxed restrictions. knew wasnt safe (Hint: snowbirds).

Now half state suggested lord knows large number tourists well.

But gonna take bunch PHDs lot time figure right wrong. Nah assume things people. opened fine, paywall. vaccinated, start take risks.

Would shame New Zealanders people Wuhan Israelis partying pandemic still ongoing somewhere else world?

There's nothing wrong people planning vaccinations. seek medical care Thailand, rural parts older folks don’t actually go real doctors problem. Pfizer. healthworkers received vaccines 1st stage vaccine program Pfizer. sister high school thing. teach second grade (probably said first post). think age maturity huge factor well.  60% vaccination rate. people vaccinated must aloud different lifestyle someone hasnt it. couple months people going take mentally. also canada locking cant even leave homes, US needs differentiate acting like canada stats spread back mind precaution. fine wish take extra precautions but, know others rightfully respect additional caution. science authorities disagree you. overestimating risk quite smug it. hopeful part thinks deadly harder convince people big deal.

The cynical part remembers flat earthers exist Sir Wendy’s drive thru.  ""Tongue cheek"" not, words rooted truth. could say ""ridiculous"" things looking post history reading stuff I'm going to. took comment place good twisted super defensive (which also makes think thats rooted truth). great day. Astra zeneca planning producing 2 billion doses. course depends blood clot risk perceived future. UK also lockdown recently. Meanwhile states quickly ending mask orders. selling people idea right fully vaccinated, TIME PARTY FRIENDS ALSO VACCINATED!

This idea that's irresponsible, really? Haha. one condition. take formal point, disagree actually slippery slope instances presenting papers referenced identity verification exist mitigate harm someone claiming different person themself. Vaccine passports public health safety measure, meant demonstrate masking social distancing required mitigate COVID risk certain population population COVID free. slope slipping really requirement vaccinated attend school travel another country, generally necessary fundamental eating indoors restaurant going baseball game. thought myth alcohol tolerance reduced time? Well talking half million people counting dead kinda matters. US. 

The main reason commented thought funny know pretty basic maths taught high school. Maybe American education system. US government (well, NIH, CDC, work closely together) *was* one called thanks data monitoring board place. They’re pretty top things related vaccine safety.

I agree seriously underperforming pandemic, though. world needs isolate Indian strain ASAP. Similar Brazilian strain. yet still sad group people likes try shame youth going pint.

No one who's vaccinated shamed returning semblance normalcy, issue enough young people fully vaccinated they're spreading COVID amongst age groups. good news young people longer threat elderly. are! Hopefully keep up!  I'm pumped!!! hope keep momentum going. Lockdowns lowering deaths issues likely cause. OTOH daughter one kid Noped right back online learning trying person day. 

Some kids thrived online learning, others much. Everyone learns different ways. give link, please? Thanks achieve avoid happening Brazil. Poland many countries manage well Canada. 
 shocking people asking questions do. missed fucking pandemic? Gov Desantis (FL). health expectancies today's medicine living conditions give I'd argue we're point anything 50 still relatively young California open months would US vaccinated stop us able give vaccines countries? Nobody actually explained that. agree. could warned people 1 1,000,000 chance serious blood clots, let decide. whole pandemic, government giving people one size fits instructions rather informing us make educated risk/benefit decisions, good example that.

I got first shot Moderna right paused it, thinking, vaccine suspended this, I'd angry. Cases dropping precipitously since early January, people vaccinated. fact look graph, cases actually started rising late March many people vaccinated. I'm saying vaccine effective, masking (or lack thereof) seem much effect especially compare states mask mandates like California New York. wearing mask big fucking deal can't little bit longer? Goddamn.

People Asia wearing masks public feel sick, believe that's going become norm too. yeah may always see people masks now, going forward. need accept 1 mrna dose good. is. virus may well eradicated timespan need eradicated. took smallpox several decades disappear, certain people act happened within week! People need actually study process diseases eradicated, overnight process. people aren’t coming close contact many people scenarios listed FDA. Wow. truly shocking. shutting world then? Fucking prions natural. probably AZ since he's UK I’m millennial absolutely agree everything said...except getting ready party part. world clearly ending absurd, easily-avoidable ways laugh enjoy little time left? Lighten up! get that. Sorry I’m naturally pessimist first responder friend mine told caught three times year (seems really high me) I’m kind scared looking positives can. I’m also greatest putting thoughts writing sorry came suggesting didn’t support getting vaccinated CDC charge access public data. time spent writing comments could already found it. protect 1 year olds? wear masks want go walks. get second dose week today. Super excited. narrative mainstream media accepts criticism racist allow cops pull people nothing. Like makes sense. Somehow engrained media cops racist justifies criticism, can't wrong allow police stop fine anybody want simple fact human rights violation. bad black people white people something. Cheers casual COVID alcoholism. It’s behind paywall? they? state. 1% linked FDA guidance. I'm literally quoting people charge. Oooo sorry 1.8% total travesty. Sorry 98.2222222222% survive powers given they'd reason stop ""car full teenagers""

not random solo driver going sanity drive.

&amp;#x200B;

last year curfew... cops drove time.. picking dog poop.

technically, breaking curfew. Yep, still plenty room spread. 

39% population first dose seems like lot realize means ~200,000,000 people still susceptible. surprising, significant amount deaths occurred care homes people could died hangnail. Speak buddy  spiking live data shows predominantly 18-30 year old spiking unvaccinated population

Well, explain young people go back gathering get fully vaccinated grandparents get vaccinated, rising cases among young people going get.

However, death rates hospitalizations still continue decline due vulnerable populations vaccinated. Hey think math teacher failed (or forgot) know calculate percentages.

Total deaths ÷ total cases × 100 = %

I think forgot ×100 part

566,863 ÷ 31,618,578 × 100 = 1.8%

Now look closely see 1.8% less 1%. really necessary come thread positive news point UK better, therefore, anything celebrate? brag UK using better vaccine? competition?  
 
What's data support assertion Pfizer vaccine effective? know AstraZeneca require booster? Israel’s cases began truly tank around 50% population fully “covered” vaccines. 


We’re ~32% right now. One death rare rate astronomically low. Thanks correcting -- appreciate it! I’ve idea /u/MayerRD downvoted. friend mine awful allergies choosing remain isolation effects vaccines fleshed out. It’s choice make decision safety. 
Their decision wait doesn’t discount amazing things vaccine done. it’s use majority people.
 points small group high risk people may extra cautious less accepting risk healthy person might ""This means untrustworthy! Vaccines evil!!!"" Reds crushing. That’s damn impressive, considering we’ve pandemic.

Meanwhile, broke ex back June lol. Independence Day gonna fucking CRAZY worries! ridiculous comment, anybody comparing Canada Myanmar seriously needs education.  Met starting dating love life pandemic. Can’t wait go actual adventures!  data readily accessible CDC, yes. Since virus care borders, boat. India tanking get back us e.g. Europe. Michigan cases already leveling off.... interesting read. Thanks sharing. heard India first innoculating young they're ones exposed, working backbone economy. Another testament boomers can't share anything. selfish awful generation history. live Hillsborough. mask mandate too, it’s completely unenforceable thanks governor. that's point, there's nothing wrong people do. That's basically always places like Japan. feel well wear mask, respect really.  200k+ tests fuckall Yes missed point last comment. adequate supply see giving 2nd dose elderly 4 months shown immunity decreases faster younger people. adequate supply see reason give second dose elderly holding back younger people closer 4 6 months. 

Again depends real world data giving us feedback people's immunity level. well everyone first dose even consider 2nd doses.

It's black white lot scenarios different response warranted. Hi! Sorry pop in! 

My allergy symptoms light last two seasons (2020 2021), instead usual *unlivable* way usually is. Im outside often usual, I'm wearing masks am. 

It's honestly incredible littke allergies bothered recently. controversial? Thank goodness common sense. Never said feds weren’t responsible vaccine procurement, Ford keeps blaming Ontario’s shortcomings Feds providing enough almost exclusively that. clear, Feds didn’t good job initial vaccine orders January delays since they’ve secured several million additional AZ Pfizer doses. certainly look better Ontario government right now. 

As example, federal press conference yesterday Trudeau discussed shipment cut 2m Moderna vaccines increase 8m Pfizer vaccines Q2. provincial press conference, Ford talked Moderna feds giving vaccines. Zero mention Pfizer. I’m sure things different FL, pick OT vaccine clinic Midwest. don’t anything ask name match appointment. vaccinated entire van Central American laborers day...zero questions asked status. Yes, I'm capable drawing comparisons discussing reactions subreddit. Shocking. Yeah we're going find excess mortality long time; example, India released 2018 mortality numbers 2020.   Lol idea spout nonsense states aren’t reporting covid cause death patient co-morbidities. follow local news here, ground reality doesn’t tie official figures think J&amp;J vaccine paused? anything linking J&amp;J blood clots? I'm trying compare situations best can, things equal. Here's understanding order events week

&amp;#x200B;

1. News reports come saying people received J&amp;J vaccine 1 million chance suffering blood clots
2. CDC recommended pausing J&amp;J vaccine paused small number reports rare severe type blood clot reported people 
3. Researches Oxford University reported people received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer Moderna) 4 million chance suffering blood clots. Serbia closer thing always wanted visit Alaska... know downvoted, right Source? Otherwise shut up! Governor believes vaccines work. news 11. Owe something? say owe anything? going continue pay store employees duration closed? owe employees something, agree? assume one thing, number people started vaccine course probably number people became fully vaccinated. step, right 1 shot, right 2nd shot 2 weeks 2nd shot decreasing number infections. 142 infected 1st shot, 31 infected 2nd shot, 9 infected 2 weeks 2nd shot. 9/182 total infections equals 95% efficacy right expect it.  believe always going option negative test instead, going 'Covid passports' instead. get point anti-vaxxers conveniently ignore bit negative tests anyway focus government control conspiracy bollox. Start? Lol getting internet days good way vent frustration daily pathetic life😂😂 Yeah. Hopefully June get influx vaccines US vaccinated (one dose) time storage too.  he? He’s arguing vaccinated people shouldn’t wear masks. data isn’t conclusive vaccinated person exposed spread virus. Masks mostly prevent happening, although there’s also protection wearer. 2nd dose slower Canada though. sure hate random xenophobia, unless I’m missing something. Alaska place would like travel June. mostly thinking meeting people summer much confinement. Also Argentina, wanted nature would go since plus visiting family.  
  
Weirdest thing see Americans complain enough tourism.. directors said 2,000 bodies stored Rome's sole crematorium, handle around 50 cremations day, mortuary rooms cemeteries packed, awaiting burial interment.  bodies storage since start year, said.**

Oh, dear. That's ideal all. Lmao third highest country G3 0 manufacturing capacity. Really depends state. Example: CA (from read registering appointment) required proof employment prove group status. NC family member came visit able get shots, questions asked mine removed 22. painful worth it. boomers mostly ones getting serious illness... would absolutely love visit Alaska one day! mother grew Anchorage hear amazing (at least summer time mind cold lol) Thought normal coming back? Think :) don’t think humans adaptable this? Yeah they’ve changed mean they’re scarred? Lolwut government “gets it”.

I honestly can’t believe nations aren’t making mandatory. Well Feds procure vaccine done piss poor job it. saying Ford great not, let’s clear manages vaccine procurement. Well AZ JnJ *did* appear higher background rates - hence fuss. Would better export doses pay tourists get vaccinated.

Actually tourists paying pocket come here, spend money raising tax revenue here. guess free, tax payers also paying medical staff time, also money trickles (mostly up) tax revenue. 100% agree! It’s amazing guy gets much heat appears actually follow science. stopping serious illness/ death :) Yeah found appointment private pharmacy weekend used that. two weeks later started getting texts nearby counties signed with, telling Wednesday midday appointments, button cancel them. Well, one button, clicked weeks earlier, sent appointment anyway didn’t work. husband accounted like 5 no-shows alone, even though we’re shotted up.

I think also lot people waiting evening/weekend walk-up availability specifically regular pharmacy. People don’t want deal sign hullabaloo. vaccinated people maintain cautions when?

- Every adult wants one vaccinated (July 2021)

- Every child wants one vaccinated (February 2022)

- International travel eliminated (Never)

- Every industrialized nation receives vaccine achieve herd immunity (2023-24)

The point I’m making is, either follow guidelines rest lives, it’s decided it’s gone far enough. There’s way summer going safe right now, factor variants fact we’ll still 100 million people population still unvaccinated. time get fall, we’ll likely needing booster shots people, adding unvaccinated.

At point, everything arbitrary Exactly this. expected research, produce, distribute new vaccine every year entire world? Doesn’t seem feasible. private company made decision employees. owe anything. English translation first section Charter Rights Freedoms states: Canadian Charter Rights Freedoms guarantees rights freedoms set subject reasonable limits prescribed law demonstrably justified free democratic society.

For measure violates section Charter validated section one must pass judicial examination called Oakes test:

1. legislative goal pressing substantial? i.e., objective sufficiently important justify limiting Charter right?

2. proportionality objective means used achieve it?

The second branch test three elements:

a) ""Rational Connection"": limit must rationally connected objective. must causal link impugned measure pressing substantial objective;

b) ""Minimal Impairment"": limit must impair right freedom reasonably necessary accomplish objective. government required show less rights-impairing means achieving objective “in real substantial manner”

c) ""Final Balancing"": must proportionality deleterious salutary effects law UK believe US did, makes bulk production

Obviously EU countries allowed order.

IM sure countries tho too. Got J&amp;J last Saturday. extremely hesitant get first ultimately decided get age group opened availability. Maybe read instead looking titles. reply conflicts post replying to, stated don’t see reason give early, EVEN supply (if delay led robust response) Really? Guess depends consider debate. People sleep India's pharma industry, times see brand knockoff meds advertised internet, India they're from. correct. tons data. Many epidemiologists biologists pushing hard policy one dose mRNA people proven previously Sad say it’s probably least 4 million.  know Russia probably undercounted 300-400k Mexico ton well (I think last week said 60% would another 125-150k) Yep click baiter. safe. far developed blod clot, does, wrong guess TBH anyone experience office politics able empathize Pfizer here. Hey come work clusterfuck project toxic reputation 3 months still exact intractable problems, it'll fault! fucking thanks get vaccine end may June well. don’t want ‘whatabout’, plenty people suffering. many bots wow Every county differently. called grandparents came another county local health department issue giving vaccine. didn’t even ask info even though told u dont get ur idiot? u banned? never get immune system Canadians getting America. Florida one specifically heard about, probably others too.  One thing Germans good at, stratification groups order “importance”. 200k+ documented cases 3 days row; course concern; specially India high vaccine nationalism government shit. Trump magnificently stupid. Nonetheless, United States incredible industrial power research capabilities. 

We got World War II got machinery produced desperately needed it, we're getting pandemic we're procuring vaccines desperately need them. passport take long time vaxcines fda approved never reality leftist globalist fantasy France people sleep eachother's houses curfew, staying together indoors longer would curfew. talking leaving Residency problem - I'm asking quarantine required prior vaccinating know schedule vaccination. back month, want make sure get shots. understand motivation. Nah ive still seen sub recently, people still calling gamble muttering mutations. restricting vaccine exports. capitalist. Hey, like EU! Jesus, 25% staggering number. makes sense since social experience became nonexistent quality education dropped (maybe dropped lot depending studying), still crazy number. wonder longterm effects be. air conditioning inside planes sucks away contaminated air filters it. Getting probably worst part flying. travelling far away places plethora reasons anyways. US citizen, living abroad temporarily heading back visit family Wisconsin. Wisconsin website seem information specific scenario. meant general, back quarantine, one wait certain number days quarantine vaccinating. Seems like perhaps answer available. people dumb hell

No one wore masks correctly... includes wearing around people HOME.

How stupid think ignore mitigation efforts home? Like virus respects sanctity private property? course doesn't... people visitors homes visitors visited someone else forth connection everyone everyone else formed distancing mask usage.

Look ""the six degrees Kevin Bacon"" understand concept, two people Earth six fewer acquaintance links apart.

I'm willing bet either visitors home without wearing masks visited someone else's home without wearing masks, likely done both, several times.

Being careful public nothing mitigate virus home like plugging one hole boat two leaks... quite cut it?

It's really hard understand viruses spread. know Americas general ignorance science what, shocking see stupid people are. tenant nurse even visitors home regularly last year come go masks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Honestly, worked pharma, doubt it. Companies like Pfizer, AZ, J&amp;J busy working many (probably thousands) things, they're also limited resources, compared rest pharma industry. Good guy Alaska UK 'abandoning indications wanting engage international collaboration'? brexit? percentage population needs vaccinated cases start going down? choice though - least areas. Might gotten confusing changing recommendations.

None published even pre prints claims it.

In order happen, study would need compare group mRNA vaccine recipients another equivalent control group.

What data suggests, without ensuring groups equivalent, rate CVT mRNA vaccine recipients much lower received AztraZeneca vaccine, accordingly UK data fact, 6 times higher. It’s less likely would anyone else.

Based timings, effectively unvaccinated strain time infected. true? India discovered new variant long ago called Variant interest:


**‘India’s double mutant could considered variant double mutation refers specific changes, among others, denoted E484Q (glutamate replaced glutamine 484th spot spike protein) L452R (substitution leucine arginine 452nd position). mutations investigated giving virus ability evade immunity past infection, even vaccines.

 March 24, Union health ministry said variant found 200 samples sent Maharashtra, became first hot spot region second nationwide wave began month. Till April 7, Maharashtra alone accounting half new cases recorded country, prompting experts suspect variant may added vaccines likely still offer protection variants concern. “The vaccines hand sometimes offer reduced protection mild moderate disease still afford protection severe disease,” official also spoke government’s recent decision make easier vaccines developed outside seek authorisation India long approved certain western countries, Japan World Health Organization.

E484Q similar E484K found South African discovered variant believed act similarly it. L452R also Cal.20 california variant &amp; susptected also immune escape ability. year bro Ah damn, forgot subreddit was, flair here. meant Belgium. mum terminal cancer really careful throughout pandemic, got second jab week. Maybe taken less care all. 3-4 per million typical occurrence per year without J&amp;J Yes plot Hollywood movie ""I science"" I, government, limit ability drug companies export vaccines, means vaccines produced effectively used here. 

This question big, early frugal orders were; production capacity available companies like Pfizer. 

If EU would ordered earlier, Pfizer would still able make use American plants deliver them. 

Guess would gotten doses massive American industrial base roles reversed EU placed orders US. Everybody guaranteed payment obviously. yes Europe example didn’t negotiate contract guaranteed first deliveries US did. Leads vaccines exported: export ban? European also. get Europe can't shit together vaccinate quickly efficiently. Every week seems x factor ramping up. encouraging. CA 16+ able vaccinate now. I’m hoping everyone wants gets adenovirus ones showing side effects? I've seen maybe one two stories Pfizer Moderna blood clot thing happening AZ J&amp;J Police authority ask anyone outside residence indicate purpose leaving home[...]

This sounding like something dystopian fiction. polish citizen, hopes getting vaccinated maybe late September... wholeheartedly agree. Hundreds people dying daily, health care system brink collapse. However, Fauci added researchers calculated incidence thromboses may following Covid-19 vaccination compare incidents following different types vaccines, **some concerns methodology emerged**. 

Emphasis  Considering J&amp;J AZ going big factor helping poorer countries actually seem best interest help get help ease peoples scepticism. keeps mutating require shots moderna/Pfizer point people probably start paying can’t afford they’ll think what’s point can’t actually come solid vaccine lasts longer year. mention already talking shot 3 billions haven’t even shot 1. don’t facilities produce enough shots quick enough Moderna Pfizer get pandemic control.

Don’t see it’s shocking idea world work together put life yachts pharma CEOs. careful though fully covered 2 weeks 2nd shot.

Be sure move shot arm around much possible shot, hydrate like heck think simple meals meal prepped 2 days post shot case get hit adverse symptoms. order reach conclusion, study would need include control group, allowing compare CVT rate mRNA vaccines. 

That’s case.

The thing conclude study CVT rate COVID-19 patients higher mRNA vaccine. whole world vaccinates rate, Pharmas worldwide obliged ramp vaccine production?

Imfection numbers trailing 1-3 weeks qctual infection. death rates another 2-5 weeks. politicians stupid understand infections rising acted weeks ago.  lived would full civil disobedience mode. hope Canadians same. outrageous. Poor baby cardiac arrest stroke Oh haha heard smeagol dropped ring well  vaccines exported MoU WHO. Also Jan-Feb around 10k cases per day source that? According I’ve read Pfizer/BioNTech supply chain largely independent Europe (when including Britain). original source „Apothekerzeitung“, Magazine Germany pharmaceutical society. sketchy source English eg #measles seems work covid well European here. something really disturbing thousands people dying virus, state side ocean distributing vaccine free. 

Even disturbing know cure disease. Yet still thousands die millions suffer. expert logistics vaccine production, vaccine widely available around globe day 1.

And I'm even living poor country. can't imagine living India Africa. Ah yes, like would Presidentette Hillary Clinton. Yeah, ditching principles free market, pouring massive amounts public money issue, literally telling companies manufacture, banning exports. EU going end deaths per capita world because:

1. older risk population 

and 

2. keep sending millions vaccines countries younger populations low death rates they’ve bullied thinking light fire keep someone else warm. born 85, year NES launched North America. Nintendo (home consoles America) age. grew together. part identity.  It’s everybody’s problem.  Highest since January. Yeah that’s right Mine pre-printed label date, vial info, etc. initials nurse gave shot. checked immediately got shot person intake observation section.  better get case count Norway hotel quarantine  Vaccine tourism next big thing guess think want make sure vaccinate also neighboring countries needed. nothing new variant develops circumvents established immune-rrsponses. virus comes Asia, might indeed genetic thing it. Shipping limited supply EU foreign countries already low death rates would absolutely nothing stop new variants forming. it’s getting vulnerable Europeans killed. got certificate got first shot date second shot I'm going keep shit better believe it! Evolutionary pressure directed towards them, mask, vaccine, hell think virus would go? Dad 4yo talking. Whot? must estimating people need yearly covid19 vaccine boosters 3rd company i've read working combo covid flu vaccination. Moderna &amp; Novavax. It’s hardly banned outright either aren’t red list may admitted subject certain restrictions. Interesting. signed online myturn.ca months ago. I'm elderly infirm fine waiting. 

Once restriction lifted age received email text could make appointment small town 3 pharmacies local health department distributing whichever brand wanted. time period trials done ? Couldn’t long strain virus around couple years . Doesn’t take around 10 years ready administered pubic . think everybody that’s taking vaccine part said trials correct I’m wrong Based OP said, they're offering parent/kids choose it. likely expected kids person, ImO could great thing otherwise severely/chronically ill kids otherwise able go in, even pre-pandemic opposed home-school getting assignments via email, etc. I'm assuming case set &amp; learned infrastructure tools remote learning. it’s easier blame woman

Aint always?  Especially backed tens billions dollars taxpayer money tens billions publicly funded research. fuck athletes Duterte deal pandemic surprisingly well? temporary success? Hence I'm skeptical whole annual booster shot thing... agree Biden Oh wow miss that. Okay. think mistake! read article? Aye good point! worried protecting brandnames perfecting vaccine. hate anyone. (and especially based age). 

People ages dumb things. call-out dumb things put guardrails protect beneficial society. Stores don’t even enforce oh..I've already accepted that. Much like cold-viruses Flu STD's communicable diseases,. always (in 1 shape, form another)

That's society builds new procedures expectations. That's social-changes happen. ""adjust new reality"". 

There ""going back old ways things"". outcome ensures next pandemic far far far worse. (and that's question ""if"".. question ""When bad"".) See like 99% sure got flu January 2020, even getting flu shot... never went doctor. called symptoms. late give medicine help anyways. 

But comments like make question flu ever slightly tbh I'll never know. Antibody tests really widely available like May friend got illness tested negative that. know antibodies live system like three months. symptoms worse Covid *recently*?.

By time personally got around getting Covid test July started babysitting make ends meet nervous, sort talked getting antibody test. felt like January soon, partner lived get symptoms went work spread it, nobody office got sick. been....

But whyyyyy worst reaction Moderna shot times?? 😭😭 20-somethings going party without reddit comments. They're living completely different world you, they've partying since August. That's going get worse given recent developments. fine. Immunocompromised people always risk, matter virus month is, can't stop healthy people living life. accept things.  would argue hasn’t bad largely due vaccines mitigation efforts. imagine would USA vaccine years come? Worldwide, thing far over. It’s partially 5 large population states hovering around 75% B117 mark Michigan. appears lot school related outbreaks, well sports daycare. think people giving up. Anecdotally, parents said enforcement adherence indoor dining rules anymore area. Fear porn fixated think important realize large number percentages matter. 

And would agree public health measures like masking distancing remain necessary cases start dropped severely. 

Still bit discouraging seemingly trying sow seeds distrust vaccine article titles. Someone fence vaccinating may see something like say “see told get still” dismiss vaccine. Rather front say vaccine working! expected. geuss doesn’t get clicks. ridiculous. can't actually make argument aside left v right.

No, love apple. apple products think overpriced inferior. also brutally exploit labor force generally terrible. 

This argument apple, genius.

Again, attempt think yourself. Yeah dang kids! Asymptomatic cases major source transmission. Virus isn’t going anywhere it’s stay. choose stay bubble wrap home scared go anywhere doesn’t mean people are. Let people make damn decisions. We’ve done bullshit year yeah surprise people sick it. Vaccinations rolling everywhere time start letting people sort freedom again. 

A year half pandemic, hundreds millions people getting vaccinated USA alone, yet still sad group people likes try shame youth going pint. Grow  don’t disagree pause, update recommendations, could connection two. They’re “resilient” whole industry therapists help adults get bad things happened kids!

The way sort secondary effects lockdowns restrictions children (or anyone else) completely ignored, cast aside, and/or shouted flat-out disgrace. DAE America bad?!?!?

Over 200 million doses administered US, country, almost quarter doses worldwide. one 10 (depending count) widespread deployment. Including 2 mRNA (totally new) 4 viral vectored (pretty new, ever used Ebola vaccine before). That’s even counting NovaVax pending authorisation brilliant trial results advanced candidates.

All inactivated vaccines brilliant efficacy even still much better hoped first gen vaccines last year.

Some places wealth choice afford use good vaccines stick exceptional ones.

Nice. born 89 yeah SNES N64 awesome. Genie, wish three really stupid comments mine: nearly 100% effective hospitalization Many people died pandemic, historic recent history, it’s really bad. People irrational thing, walking around outside masks, isolating children course corrected months ago things like pose little risk. think combination factors. adults vaccinated, children main carriers, allowing mutations ultimately lead children getting sicker. virus' best interest illicit immune response (runny nose, cough, etc) allow spread easily. course malnutrition poorer overall health make worse. messaging 2 years [**2023-04-17 14:05:15 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2023-04-17%2014:05:15%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

As factories.

Also tower blocks full office workers easily work home. number cases exactly study showed .04% still got even though vaccinated. want know ARKANSAS SECRETS, LET People “non risk” young groups pushing waves whole pandemic. happened summer states reopened restaurants bars, happened Halloween. 

There already infectious variants leading huge increase hospitalizations, direct result people going far need to. According headline, makes me, 38 ""young people"". Woo-hoo! 


I think everyone ready party. Lol, there's optimism right Yeah seriously, it’s like people desperate act like everything going back normal aren’t yet.

This worth discussing, anyone info it?  Nothing, leave us alone


(please) AZ occurrence VITT, reaction named Denmark germany, 1 40000. Making dangerous covid-19. patrons decide willing accept risk going not. They're idiots. they're young. I've repeated myself. ... that’s what’s called “social end” pandemic. Yes. wonder whether interviewer 's doctor's mistake. guess got lucky haha. I’ll see middle day, yeah, don’t feel much different sore. live GA. show ID prove residency. Kroger vaccine website really good. sub claim continue wear masks cold flu season public transportation. 

&amp;#x200B;

If want that, care? harm you? (actually, opposite anything). Wait sec, trying tell spending 1.5-2 years forcing young people give fun kind well access normal educational experience order protect couple generations people already handed complete turd sandwich economically, environmentally climatically might somehow negative effect psyche?? Quick, someone alert mental health professionals!! mystery. vaccine 100% guaranteed prevent infection. JFC. immune compromised unable safely get groceries children high risk conditions unable attend school healthy 20-somethings party without masks distancing. Got it. isn’t even matter free spech, stating facts, wtf.....i got pfizer 11 days ago, (i’m certainly antivaxxer) trust it’s good vaccine, know cases CVST. That’s rven secret Calm fuck down, pandemic yet Died *with* Covid. Ftfy :) “We” haven’t really done anything wrong. was, is, pandemic historic magnitude. going significant mental scarring matter society chose handle situation. Well said. Yes ;) ends september. running next election.  It’s sad one really wearing mask. see people/friends taking seriously. mask, distancing, parties, trips goa. would shocking wasn’t spike. Nothing companies politicians done past year anything compassion empathy. weird main “expert” quote owner dance studio reporting anecdotal observations dance students. mean, quote psychologist briefly end, mostly it’s dance studio owner. 

Regardless, don’t think ever way avoid past year stressful lot people. articles like seem suggest everyone would better mental health never shut anything down. we’d done death tolls would even higher comes mental health challenges. Even don’t personally know anyone affected, going life new danger worry causes stress. always going difficult matter approached it.  get herd immunity naturally vaccine. rare somebody young die disease.

So, elderly vaccinated vaccine openly available weeks State, obviously time rip bandaid off. think missed point. truly Celsius would long dead. Denmark germany found vitt condition caused J&amp;J Astra Zenega, happens 1 40000. Much dangerous covid-19 course say OK, they're crazy put money Russian (enemy) pocket confirming efficiency vaccine. politics. 30 years ago ""conservatves"" wanted censor speech/music we're totally fine companies exploiting workers. Today ""libs"" want censor speech/music totally fine companies exploiting workers. almost one ever stood anything arguing personally benefitted time. love apple, get it. make great tech, rich, money God. get it. agree Good point. iirc virus respiratory one. wife Pfizer. first one barely noticed thing second felt like shit day (flu-like symptoms), rested day next fine.  America: *feelings.* xenophobia? Given prevalent variants right imagine playing significant role, think India Brazil perfect hotbed variants continue mutating variants pop up.

Which variants win spread beat variants something don’t want find out. patrons making decision eat there. point, it’s don’t think? shouldn’t hand-holding stop there? I've seen articles kids getting hit harder Brazil India. I'm curious, want clarify mean kind pejorative way toward people countries, could worse outcomes among children partly impacted things like poverty associated malnutrition, poorer overall medical care, etc., purely function new mutations? Idk. I, folks know shit ACT went college straight students. think better ways assess students’ capabilities. colleges don’t test much know general, test content taught you.  Spoiler alert: *always* going billions people aren’t vaccinated. *always* going chance new variant (or new virus!) emerges. Covid always going exist. Better get used learn live it. vaccinated greatly reduces chance spreading transmission. much money need vaccinate 10 million people? estimate $ 500 million. I'm sure single country world spend ten times money year weapons would need vaccinate people. 10 times, say 100 times? heck Arkansas Well front guy make sure it’s “real” Thank you. stay home Thank you. feel much better expect US vaccinate population first? person 18 get jab here.

Not saying precautions aren’t needed job probably hell Earth workers families get protection need meantime ""We flying blind"" contradictory statement ""we homing in"". noticed many teachers universities also stopping teaching mostly old ones cause dont really feel teaching poorly like + trying use new platforms reopen everything, everywhere, restrictions now? I’m getting tired hearing “incredible number” vaccinations yet restrictions still feel (in Washington state least).  11 days air hotel vancouver Canada 2000 CAD per person.. takes full day half get  money?

Do really think so? literally got J &amp; J vaccine tested positive day later Welp, good run. vaccines proving protect variants. imagine health students, university cancelling practices passing theory alone put leaders place take virus seriously, competent, develop comprehensive plan, secure funding help states distribute administrate vaccines. get results. exhibit good government action. Daily threads anti-mask anti-lockdown.

Even asking restriction gets downvoted. Even unlikely, completely invalidates said. anymore last year. Millions people celebrated 4th last year BBQs/parties. people stayed home nothing last year probably stay home nothing year- “but variants!” “I’m going isn’t single case Covid” “you still follow social distancing even vaccinated.” 

Yes people like this. Quebec target June 24th ease lot measures. 
Keep hope. also great summer I'm sure. might half-baked question, but: wondering reaction vaccine acts indicator vaccine effective?

Obviously, know vaccines effective even without side effects, curious strong response could indicate real-world effectiveness body, vaccine protect *everybody* symptomatic infection? infected spread it. Israel reported 34 cases 1 death. Get damn vaccine, haven’t, end thing. throughput organization got mine really quite impressive. I'm sure they're well done, pandemic help create blueprint ever needed future. wish they'd focus getting seniors fully vaccinated giving absolutely everyone first dose.

My 75-year-old father currently hospital (non-Covid), Covid patients floor. think probably needs second dose 30-year-old sister needs first dose right now. experience, anything Youyang Gu's modelling inaccurate. way hell Ontario 5-digit case numbers summer due seasonality increased vaccinations. blows mind Canadian European officials throwing around idea restrictive summer last year. That’s exactly thought last year. End April felt like allergies, tested positive first day May. Can’t believe it’s almost year since it. sitting mountain AZ vaccines never use letting rot warehouses. that, also banning exports rae materials hinder others making said vaccines would never use. took two weeks 40% first shot, UK. So, we're probably two weeks plus couple days. Please hurry Canada seriously denying title purpose. Uptake like 80% age group.?.?  WTH? Hope younger folks match it. HK, apart anyone 16 get jab (either Chinese BioNtech - choose) get on-site certificate first second jabs.  It'll nice Canada gets cooler full vaccines. right. Probably little vaccinations  completely real accurate testing needed. someone dies don’t count falling cliff covid covid death car accidents. die covid. Got J&amp;J last Fri good midnight got chills fever migraine felt like crap 2 days .. . regrets Yeah since said safe drink...did drink it, invited Chinese, object dumping. seem much confidence Japanese scientific acumen integrity. instructors also getting realtime feed back student. Usually instructors try explain something better see class looking lost. get mostly one way online instruction. province in? BC published plan age group advising sign vaccination schedule Yeah, Bavaria vaccinating many people. Something incredibly rare maybe happening AZ...no, stop using now!

Try something tested trials still ongoing...yeah, that's good.

Interesting. three countries? Aside Philippines Japan, infection rates deaths much lower western countries overall. Even Japan it’s poor handling still fared relatively ok due things like mask wearing. Great. also helps Moderna Pfizer vaccines made US pretty good distribution network states. It’s lot harder get overseas due temperature requirements. I’m assuming they’re working manufacturing overseas well, haven’t looked details yet. Every Farman state different system. got apartment Bavarian system. money. enough vaccines going around. countries produced getting shots first. That's we're seeing here. place big push 1st's 2-3 weeks ago primarily 2nd shots right now. state New England still struggling get shots arms cities economically disadvantaged post-industrial areas. lack resources, rather appointment making hesitancy. said state leadership pulling stops (mobile clinics churches community centers, door door appointment scheduling, working local leaders overcome hesitancy, etc) get done. I'm cautiously optimistic we'll good shape end May, slightly sooner. already posted Reposts removed. Also, future, translated title post needs match actual article. example, post, actual title is: ""Study Sinovac carried Chile showed 80% effectiveness preventing death."" There's prolly bigger problems, sure. But, we've 100% learned one biggest problems public health messaging. covid vaccines miracle level that's preposterous. 99.9992% affective preventing getting covid fully vaxxed. lead messaging. Get it, wait, live life. downvoted? Dumbasses crickets man. Thats going hear problem federal government power ordering things necessary, like lockdowns curfews. That's states, last days actually discussing changing law give power federal government regard till passes Merkel try convince prime ministers states right thing even ones party really follow lead.

Merkel consistently predicting what's going happen states ignored her, weeks later predictions happened states suprisedpikachu.jpg.

But course people going blame anyway. enough vaccines world. money only. feel like deaths never get super low old people want vaccine. know people social circles want get vaccinated covid-they're healthy enough get vaccinated, want to, longer want anything them. I'd rather less friends selfish short-sighted friends care right thing.  know mean, think referring like 3 East Asian countries ""most countries Asia"" here. problem can't approach forever...people need get vaccinated want protected expect shut things every time covid spreads...the vaccine works. Nope, state made illegal issue fines violating local mask mandates. I'm exact same. find reading pandemic less less. immediate family close friends fully vaccinated too, I'm back normal hanging them. Ah, clarified, ever eradicated one *human* disease. second eradicated one cattle disease according article.


But yes, technically correct eradicated 2. technically correct best kind correct! fuckton functioning people. That's title IX ramifications, 85 college football scholarships means school must provide 85 female golf/tennis/gymnatics/diving, etc scholarships - programs generate virtually revenue substantial logistical costs bleed money. men's basketball, baseball, etc.

Athletic departments overall may struggle break even. Men's football basketball typically self-sufficient generally fund sports. similar experiment back grade school agar Petri dishes. 
Hand towel far worst household.  
The toilet flusher hand could eaten of. getting vaccinated is.


Given data vaccines protect nearly everyone death hospitalization, showing promise stop spread, vaccination clear thing service employees control.

Any public facing job risk getting sick, that's new, least covid effective vaccine...we can't protect everyone getting covid... treatments already, move along stop living fear. I've seen several sets numbers like mortality prevention number lower hospitalization number, understand works. Would happen know? would fit right 1930's Germany. Brass mouth. Tepco claiming contains Tritium only. entirely transparent before. general advice UK well today, apparently enough Moderna Pfizer given pregnant women US assess safety. never got flu shot 2019. noticed would get flu every three years sucked. get horrible fatigue lose smell taste days. mother died 2018 grieving process caused get constantly sick months. horrible flu month death. thought, ""fuck this, I'm anymore,"" decided get flu shot year after. really gotten sick since. mild cold January 2020 lasted 24 hours. There's chance still get flu getting vaccine due different strains hit less hard unvaccinated. 

Covid really changed perspective except maybe wear mask I'm sick. already wearing masks airplanes tired getting sick every time flew somewhere. standing long line Subway yesterday 3 maskless people eating, standing line food. first time throughout this, actually calling assholes mind. thought ""you know what? Odds antibodies prior infection and/or they've least one vaccine dose."" Plus 2 weeks since 2nd Moderna dose whatever 40 reporting in. Got 2nd shot yesterday. I'll feel much liberated I'm done tired (so tomorrow day after). Thankfully side effect got time around. find this? vaccines worse trials. So.. natural immunity little better little worse, depending vaccine, right? I'm sorry hear - know lockdown easy Germany. similarly insane Italy. none things got vaccine last week Saskatchewan Long term impacts vectors spreading disease. *I* seriously don’t understand there’s misunderstanding that. 

My goal parent give child best quality life possible. low bar making sure stays alive. Tell countries Asia. One human disease. Ok bot didn’t like link (an article linking study) look COVID FAQ sub, you’ll note jump 57% (protection *between* days 14-20) 76% protection (day 21) cannot find damned link discussing doubling antibodies week two three it’s driving nuts. feeling? got second Moderna dose yesterday feeling like hammered death today.

Worth it. that's means. people go ICU die. let's say 50 people without vaccine go ICU. 90% (89%) less would 5 people vaccine going ICU.  hopeful. think complete eradication disease one human-kind’s greatest accomplishments, hopeful contribute accomplishments. Probability. man truly psychopath. little doubt US would similar position dump Trump. Gotta make next 10 year count! haha Sorry, using word “several” wrong. We’ve eradicated two. [(unless Wikipedia next 15 years pretty bad too. think going hard time making kind justifiable claim herd immunity long time. LA County, reached [1% positivity rate today lowest record since pandemic started. peak positivity rate 20% estimate 3 million infections occurred across county. county 10 million people 41% 16+ least 1 shot. 

I’m sure don’t want jynx looks like we’re approaching community immunity Los Angeles. really know. could combination seasonality (they big spike exact time last year), B.1.1.7 sooner elsewhere, poor urban vaccination levels, low immunity levels due good containment prior recent months, total inability legislature governor cooperate anything. Actually, also eliminated one additional disease: rinderpest.

[source know quite ways away, honestly believe collective ability completely eliminate two diseases (worldwide) one greatest accomplishments (human) race. month ago lockdowns supposed lifted 18th, May even June. think need come end point. point varies state, province, case rate, slew bunch things. ultimate goal end mask mandates eventually ending prematurely could detrimental. state 28% people fully vaccinated; governor dropped mask mandate week ago. means 72% people either haven’t gotten choice (oh well) haven’t able get appointment either first second dose yet. That’s premature IMO. FDA revoked emergency use authorization (EUA) hydroxychloroquine treatment COVID-19 June 15, 2020, results several clinical trials failed show HCQ could safe effective treating preventing COVID-19 (here , July 1, 2020 FDA published summary review safety issues use hydroxychloroquine treat hospitalized patients COVID-19, seen . Chanapa Tantibanchachai, Press Officer FDA, told Reuters via email April 9, 2021 FDA’s recent update such, FDA changed position hydroxychloroquine since June 15, 2020. really surprised this, flu shots something get annually, would make sense covid. One shot year big deal unless stop making free get. Yep. Even vaccinated every female 18-49 (the group appears risk) looking way fewer 100 deaths current rate (I think closer 50 can't recall exact numbers). Meanwhile covid already killed something like 12000 people demographic. what's real risk? problem vaccine supplies far level makes sense start allowing this. deliveries ramping up, next weeks might see approval this. That's rude way refer trans person Yep, Europe right absolutely sucks. Netherlands we’ve lockdown since December 15, stores closed, gyms closed, basically everything closed. Restaurant closed since beginning October. Doesn’t seem like it’s going end soon either. Hypocritical probably closer truth I’d love reexamination many parents send sick kids school there’s leave parents. It’s better year hope continues! think points really accurate. vaccine prevent infection symptoms large majority time (like 65-85%), even larger majority time (like 99.9%) prevents serious illness death.

For second point, vaccine prevent spread, sufficiently studied whether enough know. Basically population vaccinated enough know conclusively, even though almost every vaccine history prevented spread target virus. opinion plenty studies Israel shown greatly reduced transmission pretty safe assumption opinions vary. appropriate title would ""almost fully protects"". one main result study says, previously infected marines: ""Infected seropositive participants viral loads 10-times lower infected seronegative participants "". means severity disease decreased. original study Lancet gives neutral interpretation, authors Mount Sinai newspaper chose show data pessimistic prism. live Germany, mom Asthma, getting shot. frustrating go FDA/CDC briefing covered stuff like this. confidence interval sides really wide. Take JnJ, 6 cases 7 million injections. 6 3.5 million women? 6 1-2 million young women? probably cases announced soon. one say risk actually based current data. thing Covid risk. odds dying Covid blood clot depends exposure risk addition factors. confident enough knowledge right simplifications like risk/reward. I'm scheduled next Tuesday. can't wait start feeling comfortable 6 weeks Y’all advice alcoholic abuses women emotionally. Don’t think right give anyone advic idea research works? Canada done first shots early June now.  


Really? Clearly metric tonne vaccines coming Canada's way. UK currently way ahead Canada expected vaccinate youngest adults mid late July. seems like good way start heroin epidemic. No, yet, soon. Vaccinations one half equation. Plummeting infection rates next step. US closed borders travellers hotspots unless US citizens residency. fiancee getting without visa country hotspot. It’s realistically marginal number doses going tourists, yes American paying honestly I’m going sweat waste military spending. right start exporting surplus doses Agree you. J&amp;J claims sell cost though. Hope joking, lot research done post rollout. told you. Yes vaccinated, can't know personal health situation. people, even post vaccination may still elevated risk given health status. 

And regardless, risk tolerance. Even perfect health vaccinated small level risk. may comfortable that.

I would pissed too. experience San Francisco, no. check id make sure zip code county. also see others thread saying opposite. would say stopping make sure 6 cases blood clots. could take time happen find. AstraZeneca think found total 79 cases 20 million shots 4 million. still small enough concern study. think everybody admit Russia well this. Like probably created successful viral vector based vaccine far. AZ J&amp;J seem less effective, also less safe. wonder vaccine causes clotting too. saying no. would worry much. exactly point vaccines. even get it, very, likely mild case. Yes government could easily made vaccine without help private enterprise. It’ll take long wait DMV, it’ll done eventually... looking covid numbers, seem set [take like [Reproduction Rate (R) 1 2 months increasing. hope lockdown measures effective vaccinating huge country India mammoth task. Except American government ie tax payer paying it. Would better export doses pay tourists get vaccinated. nothing else US saves administration &amp; service fees allowing one else jab.


Immigrants whether legal status vaccinated. may US legally selfish reasons vaccinating neccessary. Also Michigan! Damn glad I’m vaccinated fact June 1st everyone wants appointment Canada booked anyway, least first shot. Given today’s update we’ll enough stock fully vaccinate 80% adult population end June. absolute asshole thing insist Biontech 60. lead 10 million doses sitting unused warehouse June, younger people still waiting vaccine. growing community transmission high average mortality rates coronavirus Malawi, widespread concern among country’s health care advocates week authorities announced would throw away 16,000 vaccine doses expired.

When we're getting ready leave sister informs us nephews physical school moment one best friends tested positive Covid deemed close contacts. parents also fully vaccinated year paranoia, getting spit night couple possibly Covid infected kids irritated me. know good, never tested might even it, livid told me. Guess going take bit longer get mental hurdle ""back normal"" thought. Thanks goodness science vaccine protection though! transparent though? 
Why lay math used derive risks exceed benefits?

Like way look certain assumptions would true risk vaccine exceed risk covid. Taking account things mentioned. opinion publish assumptions, outsiders evaluate reasonable.  

My perception based feelings risk, hard data.  benefit abundance free testing linked civil registration number.

Denmark testing around 200k per day via PCR population), slew others via antigen tests. going vaccinate not?
This article saying much could vaccinate really gonna start, miss something? 
🤨 clearly putting words mouth. I'm saying vaccine super joint project many countries involved development. could always bypass border using many unguarded crossings. I've AZ jab. strong supporter AZ doing. comes point trust data accept problem needs managed careful selection recipients. Denying problem helps nobody. probably best study this: /r/COVID19/comments/mfrv1i/interim_estimates_of_vaccine_effectiveness_of/ ""Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (≥14 days second dose) **was 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status;** vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (≥14 days first dose second dose) 80%"".

Note ""regardless symptom status"" part. includes asymptomatic infections. vaccines prevent infections entirely 90% time, symptoms. Weird. People Nordrhein-Westfalen seem still fairly well following restrictions. Like everyone still wearing masks part least. We've yet curfew though Ontario here. want wild ride. 

Ford complete disaster. Months non-science-based half measures gotten us here. tired schtick deflecting blame federal government vaccine procurement isn’t working anymore. third wave government.  I'm sure find exception there, trend exceedingly clear: UK turning inwards. skin cancer spots?!

can specific mean why, cancerous, removed doctor? hard line. going depend regional risk Covid, availability vaccines, etc. sure it’s match harass women drunk bbc fantasies? Yeah father law got doctor. I'm sure could managed online confusion call doctor (or see regular checkup) ask it, that's lot people end getting it. 

Navigating multiple sites different login info, limited appointment availability disjointed hurdles people far doubt prevented otherwise-willing people getting vaccine yet, I'm sure time trickles regular medical care outlets we'll see willing unable numbers dwindle.  CCP evil also capable scientists working it. sound like child. 3 year old nephew anaphylactic food allergies trial related one, otherwise sister would tried get one trials. said, vaccine authorized EUA age group, he’ll get vaccine long isn’t contraindicated (although reason think would be). far CVT 4 million Pfizer / Moderna &amp; 5 AZ used lot AZ UK. Though Oxford study &amp; behind AZ combination low platelets 

There concrete proof seen state low platelets related blood clots. seeing low platelets could related unrelated clots. theories causing vaccines are. platelets well may causing clots, also unrelated side effect. Covid cause blood clots, low platelets &amp; spike used may causing immune response causing issue.







If choice wait MRNA AZ going wait vaccinate vulnerable ? mrna use sure cautious. choice AZ maybe mrna come summer 70+ would wait ? think what's lost debate risk mrna available. either Az nothing vulnerable globally. groups dropping like flies covid &amp; collapsing hospital systems. There’s opinions; facts. It’s one sure truly right. know humans destroying planet causing catastrophic climate breakdown. know coronavirus exists, kills people; know vaccine far safer letting virus run rampant Keep money, please throw lumber fence. ragging - honest - instead want say find use word ""sauce"" place usual ""source"" utterly delightful

I hope starts trend :) guys responsible study obviously. couple bad scientists don‘t mean everyone bad. Also last time checked, age building influence intelligence people within, maybe oxford study too? supplement industry trying put exercise pill feel like need keep repeating stating obvious. I’m saying people without college degrees can’t high-paying careers can’t get good jobs, general, holding else constant, college degree makes candidate attractive. Additionally, college-educated people make money average people without degrees, that’s backed data. qualify receive vaccine (age / occupation), free, includes visitors. ask ID check age. long registered online local address (which check). 
 
However border suspect might entering US get vaccine turn away bar fr entry future. correct. works vaccinated group control group (unvaccinated) size. states don’t care. People state (Michigan) getting vaccinated Ohio Michigan opened Q: buffets open?  Pfizer lol Probably vestige America extremely plague-ridden, due vaccine less less true passing day active area study using genetically modified viruses fight tumors. Obviously dangers, might mean studies using coronavirus oncoviruses.  Frau Merkel, you?

Obviously next lockdown come total censorship media, traitors saboteurs can't make fail simply stating work. maths assume populations size? think article gives enough data calculation. Unless I'm misunderstanding something, already various ""double mutant"" variants get media fixating much idea particular context. threshold acceptable risk FDA? 

I seen published anywhere. J&amp;J vaccine halted due small cases *thrombo*\-embolic events.

They studying 6/8 cases among 6/millions.

I guess restart vaccination reason odds admissible benefits far greater negative effects, case, stopping? forgot fourth way: mandatory semi-automated contact tracing heavily enforced case isolation. contact tracing mostly joke, relying honesty dishonest people unchecked compliance isolation. TECH! 
Go check FATFIRE sub. Full them. degree, retiring 40 millions. (I worked tech) still quite awful consider tests done, fairly young population insane rate growth. idea talking about. Firstly, enhanced testing sampling programme started funded UK government. Secondly, deals go back years ago, especially ones Asia.  clearly implying Germany take everything themselves, sound collaborative me. can't, psychologically. us large urban MDUs units connected interior hallway

Yeah place built. large apartment tower positive pressure hallway HVAC units. Best leave bathroom fan open let air circulate. someone smokes building, smell entire floor. think landlord anything this. learned recently vaccine skepticism change following ""autism"" debacle like thought did. Andrew Wakefield published fraudulent paper linking MMR vaccines autism 1998. MMR vaccination rates actually went year after, 86% 92%, stayed around there. sure kind data means Covid vaccine adoption, thought interesting. However define it, agree bedroom one best guess least reaction widely publicized outdoor parties (presumably social distancing masking), left behind lot litter parks, least part Ontario I’m from. suppose speaks fatigue restrictions. However, fact incidents widely publicized generated fair amount outrage likely led restrictions outdoor gatherings. One instances gut reaction (outrage//we deal pandemic fatigue) probably drove response measure. UK foreign aid half Germany's this, per capita barely half real big spenders like Sweden.

Not mention deals getting back years ago, making progress.

The UK scientists great collaborating though, I'll give that. that's despite government rather thanks to. prevent catching Covid-19. stops symptoms becoming dangerous you.


It significantly reduces chances infected. prevent infecting someone else covid-19.

If infected, chances much lower, viral load average lower thus probably e able spread well unvaccinated person infected average. vaccine production slow. I'm hoping major pharmaceuticals shit together come winter. genuinely need new strain comes. Ontarian say likely due UK strain combination lack vaccinations vs US UK. seeing similarly high numbers across Canada. 

Michigan idea, vaccination rate? Sure can. least lot us can. big deal, course. quickly feels unfair even categorize pain.

I think actually call jab sound gentler shot, people genuinely afraid of. Dude, there's still people dying medieval black plague even today. population billions, there's always crappy disease running amok somewhere Really? 66 million exposed virus? sorry 66 million people exposed virus. number find effective vaccine would breakthroughs / people vaccinated exposed virus. unknown number. people vaccinated exposed virus can't included know vaccine would worked know encouraging big unknown Exactly  new variant? matters many vaccinated came contact virus. figure effective is. articles read, huge fact brought up. keep reading wow 5,900 77 million fully vaccinted virus. misleading light jog least. Yeah i'm totally basically saying last month. messaging safe need post vaccine really really bad likely actively dissuade people getting vaccinated.

I think going see politicians pivot unity post pandemic language coming months. far away everyone every state getting vaccine want one cases pointing downwards every state. going living completely different world memorial day. people want stress &lt; 500 deaths day clear downward trajectory half population fully vaccinated choice really think makes much sense. (my guess situation look like memorial day)

At point recovering mental health economical consequences far greater priority. That’s poor use resources friend. Unless you’re leaving something else. otherwise well child satting 89% barely needs lights sirens. U.K. vaccinations added digital NHS file card info. Additionally single life countries worth less mine anyone else.

You know, read lot philosphical texts, like Kant Schopenhauer Hannah Arendt, try form opinion this, much thought, inevitably get question: 
What telemarketers YouTube celebrities? Even without testing, bodies would piling up. might continue wearing masks around flu cold season myself. get sick least twice year working kids. Lol Ha! That's de facto vaccin export ban. that. Defense Production Act used prevent exports Trumps excutive order. didn’t anything sore arm may get lucky Bayern doesn‘t get vaccine states. fast used state. Saarland seems act quickest, way. believe may missing number. states resident requirements less true places right There's heavy misinformation campaign Poland. use pandemic affect political opinions.

My father religious person, also supportive Solidarity movement 80s. communism many people joined communist party, life much harder didn't. never sucked principles.

After listening shit supports Lukashenko (because one leaders, bribed Gates, Rockefeller Soros) pope also it, servant Rothschilds etc. pandemic control population etc. know get this. 🤔

Everywhere guy goes, COVID-19 shows up.

You wonder long going take someone figure who's it... Cuz ford stupid makes JT look like Einstein. really sad part AZ US probably needed seems like good chance never approved. start vaccine diplomacy now. would feel so... exposed. 

Can’t even imagine face shield nothing else wtf lol. personally get vaccinated point. feel like part issue here, fucking huge issue government really needs start giving attention, see news ""you're vaccinated change anything"". Naturally could lead young people conclusion ""I'm really risk get covid, vaccinated really change anything terms freedom live, vaccines likely safe tough ignore unlikely still possible complications, get vaccinated?"". totally empathize stance even though particularly agree it.

I like unity hell lot, think important. think part frustration rooted fact I'd like see people brought together more, think everyone needs take second say ""alright biden/fauci call quits, people need incentives beyond 'you maybe kind hey covid'"". feel like happened we'd see far less hesitancy. article:
""six women developed rare potentially life-threatening blood clotting disorder left one dead one critical condition.""

I'd suggest try least using actual facts attempting make point. Pope highest authority Catholicism. sounds pretty heretic job respective governments US EU decide exports go. However, job governments make purchases much advance get vaccine doses ahead line.

That's US did. bought several vaccine doses, including Pfizer Moderna, back July-ish, time idea whether vaccines would effective not. gamble, gamble paid off. EU government, however, played penny-wise-pound-foolish vaccine orders negotiating prices reality could've paid them. negotiation caused lot delays many countries placed orders manufacturers allowing get ahead line.

Vaccine manufacturers contractually obliged fulfill orders time deliver vaccines respective governments purchased them. EU ""right thing"" ulterior good allowing manufacturers export vaccines; they're exporting vaccines purchase orders outside EU EU itself.

I'm India similar predicament. largest manufacturer Serum Institute (AZ vaccines) exporting production hundreds countries, including UK, Canada, several third-world nations. fault SII they're exporting much, problem government failed place sufficient orders time. government placed order vaccines yet approved Pfizer, Moderna, et al. 

The takeaway instead resorting protectionism seizing vaccines forcibly, blame powers hold authorities accountable. children around? That's normally explanation weird looks jaywalking, laws like US. cancer 3 months left live, I'd roll dice covid. Nothing else work anyways. That's weird. can't even sign yet getting shot SA. Even though health risks working grocery.

As always, Bavaria gets fruit labour whole country.


Like even possible? move vaccine places prio1 even done? 0/8 shit b8 m8 .... like plans vaccinate people. science issue. media issue. Ever actually read journal article headline based on? little common. 

My favorite new study x cures y. Flip coin article mentions study based three mice. 86% O2 sat?! sent kid home sat? Covid aside. Symptoms aside. NEVER send kid home O2. care brief resolved. That's absolutely grounds admission. that's grounds malpractice. I've personally seen children sent via helicopter closest peds ICU O2 89%. Holy shit, saying friend stabbed/impaled trident Sadhu taking picture him? celebrated friend laying there?

I’m guessing taking pictures without permission big no-no, geez sounds little much. sticker also exists make nurses job easier adding information boxes. Instead copy lot number name, potentially getting numbers wrong add sticker.

The real use document get injured vaccine use documentation get compensated. 

Weird anti vaxxers opposed it. TV news yesterday said booklets COVID vacc sticker sold €150 via Telegram. Pregnant mothers getting vaccine. babies getting antibodies, Mom, like Mom. can't see work kids directly well. None us want ""deal anymore"" we're really control that. comment seems kind dismissive Zika virus. caused thousand babies born birth defects Brazil. 

The number much lower increase Zika-related birth defects US well. 

It pretty big deal. Yea always get though Germany vaccine passport. 
Though faked trivially easy, mention 1/3rd entries mine done myself, since bought vaccine own. 

So I've reckon really give much confidence conspiracy theorist lunatics fake it. believe one Polish bishops said molested, go straight heaven.

So look actually favor. mean, cruises literally go Alaska. course popular place visit. new variant designated Variant Investigation (VUI) PHE. variant, first detected India, includes number mutations including E484Q, L452R, P681R,"" PHE weekly report identified 77 cases variant UK appropriate public health interventions undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing. variant designated VUI-21APR-01.

They modified instead delivering DNA itself, delivers DNA coronavirus' spike protein. DNA itself, virus can't replicate, similarly spike protein complete virus can't replicate either.

The adenovirus vehicle words vector. suppliers already prioritized medical customers. N95 masks made average consumer anyway. 3M already scaling production, assisting prosecution anyone attempting circumvent supply chain.

Lying people never right approach never walk back without revealing longer reliable source information.

The Asian nations, notably Japan Korea, long found research cloth masks better masks. would appropriate messaging time. anyone know North Korea hit this? hope cases start leveling soon general public opens coming weeks! EU ass, sitting Germany it’ll months get ass vaccinated, pissed fuck vaccine takes 10-14 days start working. tested positive day 15, there’s good chance infected vaccine kicked in. seeing everyone age group filling ICUs ventilators must scare hell you.

I think that’s big part it. elderly know inevitably die sometime distant future dying Covid ventilator particularly nasty painful way go. also know chances dying pain pretty high get vaccine really big deal.

 Depending age lot elderly people really far removed truly horrific diseases either. great grandfather young guy nearly died Spanish Flu killed lot people small town polio big concern grandparents generation growing up. soon grandfather offered covid vaccine rushed get it. people grew first hand knowledge fear diseases pro vaccine people I’ve met. don’t want inhale people’s nasty ass air. Even smell someone smoking cigarette it’s disgusting. Keep masks please. Yeah yeah, postpone social life free time another half year. Gotta make sacrifices right. Sacrifice life quality old! sacrifice life quality children! reward, vaccination summer, guilty pandemic crime youth health.

What took shitshow, healthy young productive age adult, nobody gives fuck us. society take. freedom money. Screw this.  kidding me? calling anti-asian racism? misunderstand something? 

I'm saying younger demographics would averse wearing masks, especially seeing Asia benefit. politics causing mask aversion, like politics driving weird rise anti-asian sentiment supposedly happening. pfizer's talking boosters A. proof concept B. prudence measure. things expensive make. Fu, head Chinese Centres Disease Control Prevention, Saturday said conference current vaccines ""don't high rates protection"".  suggested China considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines, way boosting efficacy. 

So ... garbage.

Six dead practically nothing. families shut hell realise greater good. happy take free Krispy Kreme! like exactly genetic material. It’s live time. rebroadcast big events prime time it’s side world. mean it’s kinda is. EUA waiver pretty explicit terms agreement take it. people died taking J&amp;J vaccine collateral damage shut hell up! clicked link thinking low number usual exaggerated headline. Nope. knows, maybe immune system start ignore spike protein since exposed body many many times. Look scrambling hide name vaccine... wish naïvety award bestow upon 😜 wasting doses potentially people get hospitalized actions, that's really great flex bro Older populations vaccinated I’m trying understand interpret vaccine 95% effective preventing COVID-19 illness. one mean?

Does mean 5% chance vaccinated people exposed COVID actually acquire COVID? 

Or mean 100% people exposed COVID acquire it, 5% show symptoms? literally can’t get enough Republican congressmen get vaccinated reopen Congress normally. clear mixed messaging lot politicians it’s real problem, similar happened masks. Completely agree. miss getting colds 2-3 times year strep every year. may wrong it’s guess National chains slower remove mom pop places since want uniform policy. based what? Well, Russia fans? plenty Reddit. risk concerned about? blood clot side effects? they're extremely rare, seem much higher background rate blood clots: health background low case rate area, would understand wanted wait get another vaccine like Pfizer. would **definitely** get vaccinated *eventually*.

Australia may many cases now, borders going open eventually. Better get vaccine happens given immunosuppressants! state schools perfectly fine cheap. Anyone goes private university chump, unless really passionate niche subject, not. time outbreak, likely already community spread takes weeks vaccine reach full efficacy. immunocompromised. Get shot soon can. They're taking natural immunity route.

(/s....kind of) Big Pharma anything extra keep profits coming, Republicans already work spreading disease much humanly possible fighting rules help contain it. mean, I'm sure insurance VA what. health insurance Medicaid there's way calling ""great"" (although, certainly beats nothing). lot people issue yes healthcare might work ""OK"" average year, *bad* year saddle much medical debt. easy say ""yeah healthcare pretty good"" healthy 32 year old go hospital. medical debt serious problem US. reason anyone around world wants survive cancer money flies US, along every advanced disease

Medical tourism happens everywhere. And, yeah, US good specialty medicine mean good healthcare system whole. also care about, example, access regular checkups stuff. Access primary care underrated multiple profit incentivized competition based, private healthcare breed innovation government owned healthcare breeds mediocrity

Competition based, private healthcare system pricing entirely opaque consumer? work, we've tried it. Functionally, there'll always issue we, society, want intrepid 23 year old take skimpiest health insurance policy (or, health insurance all), get cancer, literally die. treat anyway, someone's paying goodbye free market healthcare. make sense 2021 society progressed to.

(While I'm note, think free market healthcare solutions illustrative reminding us incentives exist.For people want free everything healthcare, there's nothing stopping someone getting $1000 MRI limited medical benefit besides time. hate free market, work healthcare.) statement: 
""“While Michigan became focal point new outbreak COVID-19 country, Michigan business executives brought forward proposals remove guarantees personal protective equipment nurses healthcare workers, remove mask mandates restaurants, encourage in-person work workers could work home, weaken physical distancing requirements workplaces. proposals dangerously irresponsible could cost lives. anything, need protective measures, less.

“Nurses exhausted. Many hospitals close 100% capacity. RNs around state put impossible situation decide patient attend to. Nurses working 18 hours time, often without breaks. begging everyone community part. Stay home. Wear mask. Get vaccine able. barely able keep heads water. crisis. need communities’ help.” Yea, obviously another desperate attempt american media wheel big scary boogeyman. interest visiting florida Covid lmao Germany, France Japan (alomg plenty examples) amazing health care systems government funded. Yes private systems competitions, people can't afford healthcare? Everyone get access healthcare regardles economic status. Yeah US done, that’s metric crap ton extra doses us Mexico get first dibs on. Things continue accelerate here. World's best maybe cancer, subpar money spent everything else. study still ongoing, wait final result. Since rolling review approved soon required amount people get covid placebo group. numbers likely statistically relevant. Cases seem plateauing Michigan anyway. Hospitalizations lag, really isn’t much point besides vaccinate many possible. US bad Brazil bad. Getting Pfizer shot next Saturday! excited!!  happens try stack pfizer moderna? become super immune? make immunity bubble around protects immediate vicinity you?


🤔 debby downer non-sense. Many areas can't even fill appointments have. mRNA vaccines effective.

Hardly worried. know wasn’t serious proposal major politicians sides pushing hard constituents get vaccinated Trump power U.S would peak 40% vaccinated months now. literally unrefutable based disgraceful track record. I'm praising biden cooling effect biggest gas lighter history gone. Exactly really hope types things start getting public attention stop body positivity trend taking over. Overweight/obese healthy let's stop promoting regardless who's ""feelings"" hurt. Exactly. People thinking EU “right thing” aren’t correct. EU couldn’t export ban without major repercussions, that’s it, plain simple. find best bang buck 30 minutes week. went 0 pull-ups 8 push-ups fifty. 20 minutes bouts cardio, cardio low goes long way. say want least time fir improvement. really expect major companies use resources help direct rivals? Apple unilaterally cancelled Michigan. #cancelculture article one attempts unviersal pan-coronavirus vaccine:



**UCI vision researchers work preemptive vaccine vaccine approach similar one used combat herpes simplex, pan-coronavirus vaccine focuses epitopes — parts viral proteins evoke immune responses — SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, four typical viruses produce common cold, well several animal coronaviruses, including many diabolical viruses past decades originated bats transferred indirectly humans, BenMohamed aiming vaccine protect bat coronaviruses yet spill humans. MI Supreme Court essentially stripped governor emergency powers. Duterte way better Bolsanaro. fair think lot people say first time people’s lives masks became widespread found weren’t getting sick. don’t think saying everyone needs that’s need herd immunity get point become personal choice again. Maybe busy working vaccines. mutations going guess make adjustments time. mean flu vaccine also every year exactly same. covid nothing narrative makes sense. nothing wouldn’t cancel Olympics cases. happened. Trump factor. definitely going mask public transportation. Wearing mask minor thing don’t mind wearing one don’t get complaints. getting flu horrible happily give uncovered mouth nose crowds exchange getting flu. think largest factor. Zero leadership public health crisis, failure governance.   news, sky blue. see CDC [deaths Covid safe kids, safer seasonal flu, good marker.

To clear, Covid extremely deadly older people, there's extremely steep risk gradient age. retail service employees 😬  Quebec curfews months now. people still making argument year on? Willful, even enthusiastic ignorance possible explanation. That’s broad generalization based handfed media. Horse shit start apportioning seats house based number vaccinated people state instead raw population. would get politicians pushing vaccines hard, regardless party. ""medically ok"" never tested controlled clinical trial. experiment yourself, follow science FDA approved trials! try boast last beyond late party 


and still failing partying. lol one did. Getting Trump really drained nonsensical currents, everyone lost idiots magic happened. Nah, one situations that's impossible judge objectively we're still middle storm. Right immediate satisfaction aim game think looking back years come it'll definitely seen correct decision ban exports Except really kind freak thing happens companies want share bad press: venous sinus thrombosis rare, estimated 3-4 cases per million annual incidence adults. may occur age groups, common third decade.

And even slight elevated risk due vaccine, surprising ACE2 everywhere body COVID WAY likely cause serious issues vaccines. details here:

**Researchers Hatching Low-Cost Coronavirus Vaccine
A new formulation entering clinical trials Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and**
Vietnam could change world fights Mount Sinai team also licensed vaccine Mexican vaccine maker Avi-Mex intranasal spray. company start clinical trials see vaccine even potent form.

Structure-based Design Prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 curious, Columbia part initiative provide countries vaccines, mostly AZ?

Covax? Yeah, shipments inconsistent lot. little AZ Covax.

Also mean ACCUSE Pfizer AZ price gouging. Colombia I'm surprised there's bribes going one way other, real evidence. real problem much Pfizer AZ real expensive, government poor corrupt shit. hanging now, already know med students older people (65+ started allowed set vaccination dates couple days ago) got vaccinated, easy. certainly LONG way away getting younger adults healthy people vaccinated. 5-tier system currently stage 2. Stage 3 4 special people need get vaccinated already. includes public workers, non-medics hospitals, cleaning staff, delivery drivers, prisoners, prison guards, military, etc. Tier 5, biggest far, pretty much normal random citizen younger 60 major health issues. Even then, prioritize eldest within tier first. I'm probably getting chance vaccinate next year unless miraculously delays issues. lots kids site Michigan  clotting vaccines clotting cause Covid related? Depends live US. Conservative places probably remove mask mandates sooner. Ironically, they're also likely harder time reaching herd immunity too, since vaccine hesitancy seems partisan. Big true rough napkin math USA....

If assume herd immunity around 65% (based Israeli numbers)

The US sits 38.5% population 1+ dose.

If assume US following natural immunity, need left get 65%:


10% natural immunity (about found cases at)- 20.5% go 

20% natural immunity - 15.5% go

25% natural immunity (what cdc estimated end year 2020) - 13.5% go

30% natural immunity - 11.5% go.


The CDC estimated back Dec 25% obviously would gone even 25% - 13.5% go reach 65%.

In last 7 days, 5% total population. 

So possible within next 3 weeks vaccinate enough people hit herd immunity - 2 weeks 80%+ protection kick in. Never got anything issued CDC... bring family member family doctor week. asked done vaccinations yet. said ""We r starting Sat."" would imagine shortly anyone going appointment offered shot. Like people runs scare story 5,300 people catching Covid vaccination, buries fact that's 76 million?

Article read vaccine prevented 99.995% severe Covid cases that's important part discussion. ""get vaccinated"" currently optional too. I'd fully support mandating vaccination specifically thinking: person A's risky behavior negatively affects person B, even person B avoiding risk things right.

But we're even close point adults want second shot + 2-3 week (depending vaccine) waiting period borne out. looks like 1-2 months away now, roughly. Lol, think may've stopped reading post exactly moment quoted.  Where’s QR Code based app? don't. Thats Germany tries get curfew going.  took day second shot off, case, I’m hoping I’ll minimal symptoms enjoy playing video games day instead sick function. notice discussions whatever disturbing variant/s happening India, get quickly sharply buried sub. particular reason this? false something? He's bad since clearly lost mind this.
The virus spread outdoor closing borders make sense situation better neighboring provinces/states .... same! think Boris Johnson getting sick strong help case convincing people (and himself) virus serious. certainly turning point UK.

So always straightforward. counties open availability earlier state requires to, based local demand. Congratulations vaccine! u/undeleteparent  think I'm feeling well I'd wear mask otherwise.  Probably owners it’s small business. I’ve noticed lot people read signs matter what. Ken moment results? produce antibodies?  realistically think businesses longer require masks. could see people wearing planes voluntarily years...but mean like local coffee shop.

Edit: U.S. news morning at-risk 16, 17 year olds next round. matter makes sense statistically still take it. looks bad otherwise healthy young women 

Tens thousands people die style thinking, end, EU might end deaths per capita total basis. Well messaging ""masks help locked room infected person, even better avoid people save masks medical professionals choice avoid people"". want, since literally effect you. got 2nd shot Friday noticed I’ve irritable depressed past days, finally feeling better today. vaccines temporary effect hormones (my lymph nodes swelled) makes sense temporarily affect moods well. Basically guys get infected / damaged. repair, sometimes get mixed up. 
So, smell again, coffee smells like gasoline peanuts like tar. (Fictitious - hope - examples) Unless you’re one 3% Americans immunosuppressed vaccine partially completely ineffective :( may sound like weird question, tonsils removed kid?

I ask wife used recurring strep infections, doctor told happening tonsils infected, never going away. took antibiotics would knock back, tonsils acted reservoir bacteria, sooner later would return. guess got infected kid, never removed, infection sort stayed ever since.

Anyway, finally tonsils removed. really sucked (apparently recovery procedure lot worse adult), worth it, problem went away. everything you, moneyboy mean sure, every bit helps, disaster that's going major impact ""pivotal moment"".

Even without J&amp;J we're going vaccine glut summer. napkin math says weeks date.

But yeah, could close. really bleak even short term tho. 20% Canadians received least one dose we're 0.75% per day. We're pace finish April, even Moderna delay, shy one every 3 Canadians dose. May alone enough get 50-60%.

That's rapid shift things even short term quoting propaganda designed get people comply losing human rights. Same, get sick alot might well wear mask gonna socially acceptable. Screwed?? think they're watching TV. 2+ million people visit May September. point popular destination visit. Coronavirus cause sudden drops oxygen levels. Lots people think fine quickly changes. types events mean could die without ever getting hospital. sick manager tells come work ...you gonna wear mask no?  1,300 reported number. Given under-reporting Brazil, likely closer 2,000-3000. Guess many support, therapy, assistance digs see fake? Yup. neighbor spent month hospital clots confirmed linked Pfizer shot. coming.

The Pfizer fanboys shills shouting everything right now. rarely get sick I'm wearing mask unless actually sick. reason over. probably make sites walk point. lot people don’t know navigate clusterfuck appointment systems (or technophobic figure out) Considering recent Taiwan news restaurants offering free salmon people ""salmon"" name people Taiwan went way change names ID, I'd say people indeed crazy. I'll wearing mask I'm sick... you? go work sick get others sick wear mask...? everyone lucky enough manager let go home. Ohio seems petering well, still hitting 100,000 vaccinations day majority second doses week half  guess depends define major since 2 million tourists visit alaska annually, twice population, isnt lot tourists compared actual tourist destinations like hawaii new york. alaska definitely gets tourists say, arkansas, isnt saying much lol Vaccination immunity doesn’t kick fully weeks. also variants current vaccines aren’t effective with. We're talking 80% across populations real world. Here's one recent article outcomes England: investigators found one dose Pfizer vaccine 57% 61% effective preventing symptomatic COVID-19 4 weeks""

""In participants 70 older, single dose Pfizer vaccine conferred 61% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 51% 69%) protection COVID-19 infection 28 34 days, plateaued.""

""Adults 70 years older also 43% (95% CI, 33% 52%) lower risk hospitalization 51% (95% CI, 37% 62%) lower risk death single dose Pfizer vaccine.""

Cutting half hospitalization/death risk elderly population really great. Half high risk still full risk unvaccinated younger person. Pfizer isn’t better overall anything you’ve read led believe probably published Pfizer might surprise seniors/elderly catch covid die. Actually, quite good margin. shows majority sub-micron particles pass cotton, N95 respirator.

Furthermore, also demonstrated filtering material means little _tightly sealed_ face. Moderna Pfizer still 90% efficacy rate variants? BRB, booking flight Anchorage. What’s rate low risk ordinary people aren’t first responders don’t sort pre-existing condition testing positive post-vaccine?  ceiling hardcode antivaxxers pre-covid times.



I wanted add appears ""easy."" reality, tremendous amount research campaigning coordination efforts across many organizations. Props involved. oh dang I'm glad asked. Close one.  Remember everyone freaking hell ""experimental"" vaccine technology? US resident? think places residency requirements. Dang. can't remember last time I've gotten sick. think 24 hour bug 7 years ago. I'd probably wear mask too. Health *really* varies lot people get 70 even 80. Damn. Definitely sounds like dysautonomia caused post viral syndrome, we're seeing quite bit covid long haulers. But, dysautonomia still farely under-recognized condition many doctors. bunch meds, talk pharmacist see meds causing serotonin syndrome side effect. wish well! We'll get anyway. everyone able willing drop everything appointment Tuesday 2 pm, naturally we'll hit point unfilled appointments well hit point demand actually started dry up. mean one dose phizer like 80% effective 2 weeks likely later you’re quarantine period makes miss second dose could still reasonably travel wait second dose. Regardless would A. Get tested B. Follow guidelines quarantine go medical appointment quarantine. son 15 months know two babies Bumpers group far get MIS-C. we're December group small cohort begin with. :( Coronavirus dangerous it’s novel virus. get t-cell immunity, wide ranging, works variants. subsequent infections less dangerous. well known reported since like summer 2020. Based known vaccination rates general public. 

But health care workers still part general public. people Oxford study. prove wrong?

(Rhetorical question, likely) immune system escapes body begins rampaging across land, killing anything path.

I mean, honestly, *nobody* read FDA reports? Merkel's trained scientist, understands probabilities risks.

With UK virtually becoming covid free past weeks (despite schools opening early March) mostly 1-dose AZ vaccine strategy, clear way pandemic better hope supress cases death numbers soon much bigger rollout Pfizer vaccine, still seeing 20-30 times cases/deaths  mean Alaska actually pretty major tourist location... Go talk doctor. message. Add angry anti-vaxers, anti-maskers hellbent creating chaos. School boards often cannot continue meetings attendees screaming continually covid mitigation policies. wheels come civilized behavior MI. ""Central East Asia"" flair.  inbound USA unvaccinated, soon land vaccinate? You’ll good! Get good nights rest. Tylenol really lifesaver... I’ve never felt chills/a fever like life. Israeli papers shown are, again, general public asymptomatic. asymptomatic analysis statistical analysis, extraploation.  Yeah, like get people's optimism last month, expecting mid-April close done May finishing blow. feels like 2-3 week delay that. 

End March, everyone talking supply going skyrocket J&amp;J going full production could getting 5M day administered, feels like hit plateau administered various reasons cases increasing lot past 2 weeks. 

I'm doom gloom, still frustrating close keeps feeling like month away. I'm kinda trying weigh options here. I'm going expose anyone help it. current plan get tested 2nd dose sure. Also, really know find local government health center, work?

And matters all, reason I'm desperate get shot planning flying see long distance girlfriend weeks we're immunized. know selfish, care important things, making months shitty happens times. feel like unluckiest guy world. feels unfair. People cope stuff *everyones* life shit - (seemingly) becomes hard deal with. ""Central East Asia"" flair.  South America first hopefully. Sure what’s something realistic could do. Tomorrow marks 7 days second jab. I’m still going wait 14 day mark anything. definitely still limited (outdoors hanging fully vaxxed people). husband got J&amp;J isn’t good level 14 days post jab patiently wait get too. Still it’s massive relief! people do. kid got accepted Boston u Fordham.  76k year. even subsidized loan financial aid. zero. Total cost 76k per year.  Maryland 53k....per year. aid. outrageous. go Rutgers. No, normal.

I’m 36 hrs 2nd dose felt like I’ve worst hangover life, entire day. Tylenol + Powerade helped whew it’s kicked ass. Hoping feel better tomorrow! 
Still, 10/10 would recommend Brazil literally turning apocalyphse. sad young kids suffer. Butanvac (how calling Brazil) works, explanation [Leandro Lobo cheap covid vaccine based flu vaccine Butantan already makes (80 million flu doses 3 months AFAIK). new method theory helps making mass production new COVID vaccine easier. promissing 40 million doses July.    
Quick deepl translation understandable way!  **Butanvac hybrid recombinant inactivated Scientists put coronavirus spike protein gene viral vector, like Trojan horse carrying gene. vector Newcastle disease virus (NDV)  
But that?   
NDV Paramyxoviridae family, famous representatives like measles virus, mumps, viruses cause respiratory diseases many cause diseases animals...   
The NDV bird virus, clever thing Butantan Institute done is!  see, multiplying viruses chicken embryonic eggs practical cheap process. problem Sars-CoV2 multiply eggs. Scientists solved putting piece coronavirus NDV (bird virus)!  
Now production done eggs.  Another advantage NDV handled safety level 2 (BL2) laboratory instead BL3 used Sars-cov-2.  BL3 labs expensive maintain. makes vaccine much cheaper! 
NDV causes disease birds, humans almost harmless. cases asymptomatic, mild flu-like symptoms.  Also, virus inactivated fragmented turned vaccine. safe!  
The NDV fragments contribute stimulate immune system, working adjuvant.  
So cells encounter Spike protein fragments coronavirus, develop much stronger robust response. still eat like pig. lived somewhere mile long driveway, would refuse vaccine someone showed unannounced vial needle hand. I'd hope door door campaigns would also lots communication? mean wanting things reopened soon possible. extra millions doses next 3 weeks would nice. obviously stopping anything, slowing bit annoying. Obviously, opinion pause unwarranted point make worse.

My state finally open every Monday, appointments still cannot found easy basis. long take side effects kick in? CDC can't admit aerosol (small droplet) transmission major concern would punch big gaping hole big lie loose-fitting, non-filtering face masks sufficient protection public.

If literally spray eachother large droplets spread thing, even talking virus. I'm sure probably multiple factors play, always are. certainly herd immunity tanked us point first place back early February like 5% vaccinated. Something else brought beast winter surge.

To me, layperson, promising thing simply breaking pattern. always story covid state think almost everywhere varying scales time; cases start slowly increasing, exponentially surging, metrics start falter curve starts bend, everything freefalls month spends another weeks slowly bottoming out, ever slowly comes slowly increasing cases couple weeks later, repeat. looked like happening right schedule, bam, suddenly sustained ~5 day drop 7-day average metrics. think that's ever happened ""phase"" pattern, happening time there's practically zero restrictions place. exciting stuff. Cancel Winter Olympic Beijing well. actually pretty great state's schools open last six months complications childhood deaths vanishingly small here. Yeah, Moderna took public funds thus could argue act public interest since they're taking public money. Blame fact elected Bolsonaro (I, personally, vote him) wait. Call local government health center help get second dose. would potentially expose others also trying get vaccinated? important data: 80% mortality prevention.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* explanation? stop administrating first doses ? see 48% vaccinated since like 2 weeks ago seem move. see scrolling bottom this: 


That pretty unremarkable. Perhaps slightly better Saturday expected. why? 90+% protected COVID all, almost fully protected severe COVID, somehow enough? comment chain removed repeat rule-breaking. here’s question, Phase III trial 3 months away year anniversary. roll CVS get third shot? How’s going work? could advertised “Trump vaccine” touted accomplishment. would boosted ego. said, first time announced same, based 1 vs 0 result lol. give details many deaths placebo vs vaccinated group time around. We'll see shows. help US regulators called cherrypicking data latest round. doubts since none studies large enough properly assess death prevention outside public health data Israel (Pfizer-Biontech) Chile (Sinovac)... well 37% efficacy hospitalization UK That's bad business would help competition got right?  offense, many hard reach places don’t want vaccines. don’t believe seriousness virus question sincerity questions. me, you’re looking downplay virus instead first place get asking obvious questions like this. easily offended also side effect unhealthy condition. body/mind problem really understood modern medicine (see placebo effect), known emotions, thoughts overall health aspects underlying system, directly influence other, time.

And nothing anyones control, true human being, animal, generally great health, lives according true nature (inner outer) -- course can't right now. grow planet, bacteria grows us. align hosts interest, die -- regardless host dies well. immune it’s low. Low enough life back generalizations ignorant.

Not them. Wow it’s almost vaccines work one EMT....

What think they've last year? Picking bunch flu patients? Lol realistically.. probably get tiny boost 94% 96% something, really bad shot reaction immune system already really amped attack spikes. Yes do. think vaccines like fire suit. fire suit doesn’t mean it’s good idea go walk carefree raging inferno. still raging inferno massive daily caseloads new contagious deadly variants rise. find pretty irritating pro restrictions keep downplaying negative consequences. truly believed justified wouldn’t keep saying things like “It virus, restrictions” “People actually happier lockdown.” truly believe hundreds thousands lives saved cost that. really complaint literally headlines Thank :) Thank :) Welcome! They'll find something else. guess is:

2023, Return Murderous Variants! 


Pfizer says 6 booster shoots needed avoid Apocalypse! 2.5 billion doses people?

Either way that's decent chunk planet one company. Unfortunately Pfizer going run distribution problems lot places vaccines less stringent storage requirements step up. Yeah, following 19 variants India since last India variant, called B.1.617, along Brazil's P1 (and P2) seem ones people fuck around take extra seriously. Due lethal, transmissible albeit research still vague, seem less affected current round vaccines. 

In fact, certain 4th wave either P1 B.1.617 based. Mark words. 3-4 months now,lre less, way things going. jobs economy pay covid debt important couple months in-person social life. pay debts, get health care die. would probably guess lot people boat seems unnecessary like hassle. I’d say it’s convenient, quick process, chance making bad,there’s large chance either feeling like nothing mild enough deal with. people magically got vaccine appointment pharmacy site really close them, probably wouldn’t going. I’d say it’s really hassle. Also, like said, mentioning benefits could come like let places require vaccination would help, even they’re speculation. Next month going fun friends healthy. need actually make plans provide source please? profiteering
/präfəˈtiriNG/

the practice making seeking make excessive unfair profit, especially illegally black market. Fewer cycles means fewer false positives, possibly false negatives. put quotation marks around mystery instead. It’s Reddit course ever went front page gained traction. thread /r/politics comments. poll showed Republicans ones wrong Covid, would frontpage news. I’m straight honestly sounds fun Assuming ever going ""over"". keeps dragging raging. I'm tired this. think lot difference is:.. 

* individual focus on? (being cynical negative ""looking backwards"" ?.. hopeful positive looking forwards?

You know old saying:.. ""Be nice people,. everyone fighting different battle."" 

Lots bullshit happens life. Lots different people take lots different kinds ""damage"". 

But guess what,. still really 1 choice (as, due laws physics,.. Time moves forwards),. figure ways overcome adapt move forward. 

If 2 people:

* Person-A nothing sit around moping ""how hard life is"" ""how unfair things are"" ""how everything sucks""

* Person-B .. recognizes difficulty.. assesses options.. brainstorms variety strategies paths forward,. strikes along paths figure way best way improve things.

Person-B going better outcomes. 

If gonna someone,. Person-B. draw scorn irresistibility. guess “anti mask loons” understand vaccines provide immense amount protection covid infection. Hot take true Wow Yeah shutting outdoor activities moronic. Okay apparently comment ""purely political"" automoderator (eyeroll).

Anyways. Point is, ***certain demographics significant vaccine hesitancy*** may end creating regional pockets herd immunity reached. That's happens we're *just edge* herd immunity nationally, that's outreach *certain states \*coughcoughsouthandmidwestcoughcough\** gonna crucial. Best luck. sounds tough ah, yes. clarify: fictional background made curious abt place (state). thought Anchorage national parks preserves would interesting :) never see report vaccination rate ethnoracial groups truth flies face progress we've made last 20 years. Yeah, people immune compromised always careful. issue right covid incredibly widespread is. It’s everywhere. Hopefully change people get vaccinated. people know immune compromised definitely take extra precautions cold flu season (like curbside groceries) risk exposure normal times isn’t high right now.  Like every police force Ontario come said randomly stop people. 99.5 percent survive much disappointment Yes, get cold symptoms, I’m going doctor get test specific corona virus. somehow end hospitalized nearly zero percent chance, guess I’d get test find wrong me. I’ve many coronaviruses throughout life never felt urge get test tell one is. problem huge number young men Michigan kind alternate persuasion, going taking shots. I've heard outside urban areas Michigan ppl masking distancing. it’s able set need get they’re much. I’ve lot control initiating exiting last year it’s good friendships. 

I hear though, lack quality social encounters rough everyone.  Hey guys idk anyone knows many days get side effects vaccine? dad got 2nd dose Sinovac week ago he's suffering mild fever, nothing serious, also Covid last year already immune response I'm worried, wanting know vaccine side effect unlucky fever. Ah! Gotcha. article said 40% single dose 25% both... thanks clarifying. Makes sense now. consider pandemic “over” restrictions masks. don’t see happening soon. 

Otherwise many inconveniences people let loose. IKR. Finally freedom resume normal life. Go back gym routine, visit parents take trip happening May. Tired “too careful” past year. Normal you... know, couldn’t believe it. ready insurance card everything. smaller town people went well never showed ID. reduce likelihood immune system would react foreign organ placed body mean yea they're research production charging higher price making profit. AZ charging lower cover costs make profit

Nothing wrong either approach, sayin they're Canada already 48 million doses end June 30 million adults. including J&amp;J. Sad many us Covid wasn’t even bad cold. massive introvert/extrovert split here

For really not. Introvert mean social interactions, means reclaim energy outside them, them. still need it, zoom real replacement.  none friends anti-vax, ones know who're hesitant 20-somethings who'll get vax site convenient &amp; easy make appointment. perspective, would telling someone feel like need shot get indoor venues like clubs may institute vaccine policies later year good angle? would make folk angrier? That’s nice you’re American know, worry things. Stay home, stay safe Lol. Irresistible! Kootenai County, panhandle. fuck’em. Let take personal responsibility actions. Make cost covid care coverage medical insurance Medicare/Medicaide dependent vax record. life insurance, social security death benefits, disability payouts. 

If financially ruin family, oh well, they’ll probably find another way fuck everything anyway.  

After freedom want, let’s give extra financial freedom. believe everyone 16+ eligible US weird way frame researching producing vaccine save millions: profiteering. get IUD!!  idea I’ll eligible one tjo can’t temp related. entire state Michigan fire map Indiana Ohio not. difference night day counties along borders Ohio Indiana, counties temps. Source: live 35 miles there. Fair point. think many states anything ensure infection rate stays down. Mask adherence middle america terrible. People still throw huge parties, travel freely. places terribly, undermine places better. state mask mandates, nothing stopping people traveling places coming back spreading friends family.

I feel we're kind relying notion things improve own, since we're vaccinating well worry now. amount travel I'm seeing insane. areas country look like pre pandemic already.

I'm worried though best seems precarious. states seem given up, like general public giving every opportunity fail. live Michigan, starting fail even mask mandates limitations still place. county 32% vaccinated, we're literally worst we've far county.

Which find concerning, paper happened. really raise alarms every state, absolutely nothing stopping spreading. fact hotels full every weekend tourists state. states getting rid every precaution, seem content declaring victory right now. cannot believe whats going month

i mean- (which realllly sad normal now) ....but FUCK! Vaxed waxed! Time go Vegas! That’ll change. We’ll enough vaccines fully vaccinate 80% adults end June. random/unexplained element it. also portion explain. know masks help somewhat know outdoors helps lot, restricting people spending hour indoors without masks help. least, masking 3 year olds. Okay, back on. Yeah, add date avoid confusion. One good friends COVID late last year yet regain sense smell. feel bad guy. Probably mask, safe. Interesting, aware that. people incapable looking others actual humans considering sides anything. big football game them. test people aren’t symptomatic!!!!?? Jesus Christ. Yes, case majority us taking precautions made easier people affected become complacent. Christ assholes insufferable. rather ""win"" imaginary argument fake internet points save society assholes like yourselves. appreciate glass-half-full perspective.  lot described high school sounds like “you” problem call concerts anymore :-) go. That's basically it. formulated sort justification heads, truth, whether true. Literally entire rise almost exclusively Michigan. Considering rise deaths id say likely recieved bad shipment tests. they're licking china's boot believe WHO. pro restrictions

So... epidemiologists people pay attention keep downplaying negative consequences

Your straw man fucking fire. one ""downplays"" negatives. want people stop selfish shitheads end thing. happen people stop pretending real *spread disease COVID deniers huge problem*.

If truly concerned mental health children, maybe should, ya'know, show responsibility society fellow man looks like. Start calling anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists truly want like people warning exact consequences year now. absolutely not, remember people arguing also believe science big Pharma government trick.

I think highlighting much larger issue, people generally stupid dangerous ways, unwilling improve. hard wear cloth face avoid Applebee’s weeks PA 58.4% adult population vaccinated first dose.

42.7% total population vaccinated. drive-through testing place near house walked knocked door, got tested problem. think posted title yesterday's post. mod must got confused decided take down. contacted it. worry, lots people still get away wearing masks. isn’t though U.S. banned exporting vaccines Canada ALREADY PAID for. aren’t allowing Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J ship doses American factories Canada rely measly ones Europe already stretched thin. Trump’s “America first” vaccine nationalism placed embargo vaccine exports Biden yet lift it. share longest land border world there’s thousands essential workers crossing everyday, Michigan’s surge Ontario’s surge inherently tied together. half vaxxed

Two weeks one shot pretty good I'd suggest using thinner brush detail work slowly build layers colors want give depth. looks great far. “science” 

the p.1 variant better vaccines original virus worse vaccines south african variant. far concrete evidence hits younger people harder whatever timeline hit cases placebo? That's probably 2.5 billion doses, enough 1.25 billion people. sure Moderna's numbers may similar. probably counting based current manufacturing, ability improve manufacturing someone would pay it. paper that's 1/3 planet's population, two vaccines also require freezing (at least now).

Even possible failure vectored vaccines (not gonna speculate that) leaves substantial gap. Even worst vaccines plenty good end pandemic, need numbers right now.

Novavax might able get billions well (in theory even easy scale up, seem problems putting practice). vaccines going hundreds millions doses year? fear coronavirus mutate something deadly SARS since related. may lot sooner 25-50 years since leaders running brain stems Lol doesn’t make sense, nothing wrong comment.  make plans party day shot #2. Thank you! keep seeing exact response lot comment sections: ""The anti vaxx crowd gonna *love* this!"" really get it. *didn't* stories like this, would lot skeptical much they're scrutinizing safety vaccines. would even argue unintelligent question vaccine rollout officials raising concerns bad batches mistakes.

I usually see response comments ""That's *smart* people think, people smart."" again, kinds comments annoy hell me. Yeah obviously dumb people, kind people think ninety percent country clueless morons probably pretty deluded intelligent actually are. average person quite competent thinking, write articles people capable perceiving accurate information making informed reasonable conclusion based it.

Safety checks very, very, *very* good important thing. can't think going ""look."" start think optics reality- Well go, thinking optics reality. saying important give illusion smooth vaccine rollout scrutinized, safe, effective vaccine rollout. public health officials kind attitude, *would* faith vaccine? big reason I'm confident vaccine aggressively scrutinized is, get people claim ""stand science"" feel way. EU partially funded Biontech iirc. already required show drivers license buy alcohol. need provide social security number pretty much significant financial transaction. need id board plane. already live society life requires showing papers. Thank this. appreciate hearing others similar concerns. I'm going call allergist's office Monday see they're offering vaccine, recommendations safe place receive it. I'm really comfortable potentially reaction Walmart pop-up tent. think lot people already vaccinated thinking people merely potential herd immunity carriers whatever rather human beings. Sure, also responding whether ""basic people."" 

Anecdotal evidence matter, mine equally important yours. reference, Canada's current 'worst ever' surge surpassed America's daily cases (adjusted population) past week, America considering really well basically covid.

Mostly think matter Canada different definition serious crisis compared places. cases deaths (compared USA Europe) particularly bad. Together form anti-vax megazord. look data comparing heavy-restriction states vs low-restriction states, looks like little-to-no effect. Probably bars, nightclubs places people drunk wear mask chin-diaper. drunks likely biggest spreaders. sites count 1-shot two, others don't. shot something different another country could actually seen bonus some. I'm qualified comment whether medically sensible, see appeal getting 3rd shot something else booster beyond whatever offered home. months 

July like, three months away, chill. sign Wahlhelfer:in, case probs like May. far much better Spanish flu 1918, 
much worse lot outbreaks we've last 100 years. people complaining coronavirus hoax pick history book let alone read it.

They set beliefs, unwilling change. coronavirus outbreak chlamydia outbreak Wow UK prioritised bringing deaths vaccinating groups, put effort vaccinating high risk groups fully getting first doses younger fitter people. 

It means might get vaccinated June 30 year old, also means death tolls ~40 per day, feels worth it. Could share article? would love read it. Thanks! recall September remember effects measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, vaccines came after.

Ah Horst. Pharmaceutical industry horrible track record public health safety. people dying vaccine. According Fauci doesn’t stop covid spread. push back question safety efficacy products? thing brand spankin' new, yet some, question safety efficacy, we're ""dangerous"" ""selfish."" can’t believe people want give vaccine children stage.

30% long-term consequences . Got 2nd Pfizer dose yesterday sore arm. Today, still sore arm, thankfully. Guess lucked out.   oh.. post removed? i'll guess reddit finally owned rich chinese, silence taiwan now. vaccine program really really works, it’s testament modern civilisation get voted sub too.

Maybe go outdoor restaurant soon. infected everyone got vaccine - eventually runs hosts  It’ll wilder goes back “normal” talk 2nd wave/year Spanish flu much worse. wonder natural phemomenon pandemics, driven pandemic fatigue. put 70% blame individuals taking precautions 30% new variants. Mental health related symptoms aren’t “in someone’s head”. also part reason lower efficacy numbers J&amp;J/J trials, done South Africa, variants. ~1 5 individuals HIV/AIDS.

I think tables interesting. last chart shows vaccinating decreasing proportion unvaccinated 65+ population week, 50-64 group pretty steady, still growing 16-49 groups. hearing kind thing often. Covid blood disease think contract it, leave easily. society's first airborne endemic blood disease many people running head first it, thinking another respiratory disease. people don’t want vaccines aren’t wearing masks anyway. Question: scientific names common cold viruses? Yes, us millenials need also sacrifice first dose get sick die old boomers get another years earth. Pharmacies actually allowed 50% capacity long they’re large enough.

With AZ clinic, that’ll use half capacity anyways.  feel like EU throw enough money enough different places. culture sensibility coming bite ass making new excuses cover like selfless something manufacture vaccine countries. Like GTFO lmao. ""letting rot"" course mean we're sending unused vaccines Mexico Canada. youre saying...get cancer bc beats COVID19? definitely gives Peter tingle  I've fully vaccinated nearly 2 months. glad see many vaccinations 😁 didn’t covid didn’t reaction except sore arm first dose. disputing that, im saying pandemic caused boom air freight routes: Might worth checking out. Good luck! So,to make easy 100 million doses 30 days, 200 million akready. mid June 400 million. 2/3 population(some shots single dose). current rate shot 4 months would vaccinated pretty much everyone (assuming everyone got one won't. current rate roughly 100 million per month, 3 months could get immunity (depending children get approved. Oh God. Please I'll send nudes exchange vaccines. true NY. passport valid proof age, proof residency still required. us Europe, selfless approach normal.

Lol, trying say here? many incomplete thoughts fucking idea, seriously. like wrote comment reap karma rewards diverse group. check boxes randoms agree you, SMH. tackle diseases illnesses exactly way.

????? Honestly I’m vaccinated it’s great time so, definitely going give blood asap!

So I’m fully vaccinated I’ll antibodies right? means blood give antibodies well? Yes, American Red Cross blood drives offering free antibody tests! Details would worry parents taking Tylenol - fine! However, giving blood great way save lives curious antibody levels! 

The nurse told it’s safe donate blood time getting Pfizer Moderna, J&amp;J ask wait two weeks shot donating.

They say takes 1-3 weeks first vaccine enough antibodies show detected test. Three weeks best results I’d make appointment least three weeks vaccine. way also virus protection going blood donation event. (They everyone masks safety.) Woah R0 Covid 19 currently estimated 4? Previously used see something like 5.7. lot people issue yes healthcare might work ""OK"" average year, bad year saddle much medical debt

Out pocket maximums thing though. The maximum out-of-pocket limit is federally mandated. individuals pay out-of-pocket in 2020 $8,200 $16,400 families. worst case scenario. Hospitals willing set payment plans work you. Fortunately, I've also discovered great investment vehicle HSA planning maxing every year medical bills nothing I'm older. job also puts $1500 get yearly check n think that's grand Woah bigger news awareness sake? Yes, seems like everyone forgot cases covid causing it.

Also 3-4 per million? J&amp;J 6 cases 7 million. term weird. like saying biopsy ""pokey around"" sort cute-speak medical procedure. Outs amazing people act line nearly Americans uninsured can't afford procedure. Americans, nearly all,have health insurance. tell I've following student loan debt bubble fairly closely people look SLABS market. similar mortgage-backed securities failed 2008 led housing market crash. debt growing linearly. growing exponentially, actually scary. meanwhile, final year bio degree honours project involved setting lab station process samples (sorting out/IDing bees) living room. classmate ended dissecting fish kitchen They’ll leave curfew NERDS amirite *high fives* Europe closing One Million. No... nothing pointing remaining high summer. Friggin cares Especially allowed go outside months. totally applies me. last 3 bosses (same company) would problem us working home days.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* So, interesting read. I’d never heard imprinting before. said, agree points commenter made. 

To add comments: article also explains different Covid flu virus vaccines, I’m sure it’s super fair comparison. Also, found interesting experts believe immunity catching virus could also potential problems imprinting.

I’m really trying start argument, based replies doubt say anything change mind this. that’s ok. 

I’m trying add extra info anyone might read even article posted points cannot *definitively* say vaccine *will* weaken response boosters. (And I’ll contend also can’t say *won’t,*, still feel good getting vaccinated myself.) want us help people? communism? there’s enough Pfizer Moderna fill void. Appointments quite simple, it’s time constraint waiting turn. cannot get appointment doesn’t mean 30 people ahead can’t. That’s matters, everyone needs it, you. Quick close gyms! Alaska beautiful state. vaccine would added bonus. “Sorry IMA keep rakin’ in” Sorry, work didn’t think ask missed. understand small slice what’s happening it’s probably lot important. Source? one Oxford. long list.

And even talking empirical? looked real medical records actual people. That's empirical gets

Just like nurses real people Please stop using argument, freaks agree lol   hurting Canada. vaccine rollout terrible, specifically Ontario. glad y’all getting jab there. Yup, Ohio even recently first *confirmed* case baby born antibodies due wife receiving Pfizer vaccine 3 weeks baby born.

My friends doctor recommended get vaccine second trimester really interesting. would liked reexamination working sickness general due nonexistent sick pay law dumb unproductive culture work.

Especially jobs clearly fine work home. living edge taking much room! one cares you’d “like” think  I'm actually disappointed vaccine hoarding, especially since seems vulnerable protected. exporting unused allotments Canada Mexico.   No, scared covid vaccines working. Stop logic! That's socialism I’ve wondering job. work healthcare. forever going working mask? Show congressman talks fast argued fauci day...ask visit brazil without mask..and dont come back wouldnt know it..shyeeettttt 🤯 Water wet. Effectively population recieved AZ followed mRNA vaccine defacto trial sorts.

This work trial. need clear statistical control group.

You would need two test groups, one receives mixed doses, gets double AZ. two groups randomised occur time, work use people two AZ doses control, different level coronavirus infection population then.

If this, way knowing more/fewer people caught covid mixed doses infection rates going go way anyway due external factors. trials done instead start vaccinating everyone watching happens infection rates... data meaningless without randomised control. Yep. 
“Humans stupid” ~my dog people tired can't deal anymore    one part went consideration (starting chain export bans), EU didn’t allow exports countries, part supply line. Lol cares Sadly people actually care prisoners, even amongst prison reform advocates find ""but they're convicted criminal"" augment thrown around somebody like. Governments think *appearance* something help important *actually* something help. glad things going well you!

Just curiosity, Red Cross blood donations test antibodies? there’s place could get test would definitely get done. 

A major reason parents took Tylenol right getting vaccines times, found might interfere bodies response immediate concerned. noticed Pfizer doses parents experienced side effects sore arm day, I’m worried might might weakened response might simply fortunate. Huh. Nope never mine removed. bacterial infections tend linger get them. good job US. neighbour Canada shit show right now. stupid Canada doesn’t Vaccine manufacturing capacity. Dear media: you’re entity uses “jab.” 

We get “shot.” Yes. mechanism type vaccine transferring COVID-19 flu-level disease, still lovely vaccine. Uh anti vaxxers know well age 40 keep seeing article article many people vaccinated literally every single person I’ve talked short 2 people refuse get vaccinated. say want wait see don’t feel it’s necessary.

Generally people I’ve talked vaccine hesitant tend poor uneducated. People work grocery stores fast food type places. 

It’s sad. sass? 

Israel cannot say empirical study showed empirical study show it. 

And Oxford study? Doug Ford idiot. science table calling restrictions. doctors science table says horrifying, calls criminal. 

They asking support essential workers paid sick days data shows virus spreading workplaces like warehouses factories. say spreading outside need police stop us go walks neighbourhood. 

This ridiculous plan Premier help case counts all. bizarre tourism approach. “Come feel awful* 💫Alaska💫!”

\* maybe variants run steam like covid-19 long immunization marginalize AstraZeneca reportedly agreed it.... isn’t new information?  got first moderna dose today one thing blew mind haven’t seen anyone talking painless shot is! needle phobia (not bad enough keep getting vaccine, enough cause anxiety), shot even realized. thought pharmacist still prepping arm, putting bandaid on. made tiktok experience, got like 600 comments people saying also hardly felt it!
I wish seeing people talk this. might really help anyone hesitant needle phobia! Conservative places already rolled back restrictions. Life back normal there. Truth TA courses still work great online definitely benefits cases using online person....but vast majority situations sucks....most classes I've taught felt like moron prof cut things rather supplement things accommodate year. thought aerosol transmission known main source transmission since last fall? country big part public health campaign regular ventilation rooms multiple people may go. really heard anyone talk either surface droplet infection months now. Thanks! could wanted employers see two candidates exact resume except one high school diploma went college, they’re likely going go one went college degree better signals they’re competent. employer interested hiring employee likely work out, they’re going higher high school graduates good heart. I’d rather governments better incentivize people go post-secondary school better subsidizing education low-income graduates hope pray employers lenient. mom symptoms? would disagree normal, go store like lowes/home depot garden center people waring even though technically ""inside"" store property require mask. true outlet malls people hop one store next, soon step foot store mask goes pocket put reach next store want go into.

Hello Qc!? wonder variants looking here. Forgive I'm wrong whole point vaccines prevent lethal side effects covid right? means ppl already vaccinated go day day life interact anti vsxed ppl got covid may catch fine. ppl get vaccines may suffer that's kind them. 

I'm kind failing see issue here. Michigan also lot areas schools kinda essential parents able make living feed kids (in poorer areas). 

Michigans problem right enough ppl getting vaccinated ur right that. u still can't mandate ppl get either cause would probably violate constitution something. ppl decide take that's kind since literally surplus vaccines right now. health system crap sorry hear this, see among friends medical field, know people ranging older oncology doc nurses ambulance people. field taken nose dive, according almost everyone know.

I recall last time someone medical told fulfilled happy work. seems like thankless job huge risk rewards.

I sorry reduced level. wonder ideas could fixed modified better reward providers serve patients? not, worries.

2. Specifically target lucky enough get tickets vaccines spark huge surge infections. That's hundred thousand people 100m pop country.

3. Hold event behind closed doors athletes compete empty stadiums. They've already done football UK. think they'd fine although would certainly ruin spectacle event. still television contracts fall back on.

4. Cancel/postpone event waste many billions. Even best case scenario 2022 there's risk compete football events.

For option 4... know Qatar 2022 take place winter months (blame FIFA corrupt sh*tshow governing body bribed oil money award country 50 degrees Celsius summer.) mean regular seasonal football likely pour summer months interfere Olympics. think headline ""covid grants 80% immunity"" accurate less misinterpretable ""covid guarantee immunity""? literally see possibly could be. lot different coronaviruses, coronavirus name family, always 'typical' presentation. kind like humans belong family gorillas.

There's way countries poor infrastructure and/or corrupt governments accurate numbers. Russia Mexico basically admitted couple hundred thousand deaths counted.

Of course, mild cases undercounted even bigger proportion. daughter 2 years old loves wearing mask goes daycare. gets sniffles, I'll give mask. dunno. like wearing masks now. Helps hide hideous face Yes. else wait for? There’s nothing else beyond getting vaccine. Aint truth  That’d nice dunno, seems UK TRANSPARENT data throughout pandemic.

This led hysterical reporting early days UK worst affected nation entire world, turned due UK reporting deaths cases accurately countries.

Russia +400,000 excess deaths 2020 reported 70,000 covid deaths, example.

But UK excess deaths turned ~7% 2020, bad, bad likes Poland (12%) Spain (11%), report covid numbers accurately.


When track data accurately scientifically much control.

I fear US tracked data well states, leading difficulties killing virus, even much massive vaccination rollout UK. Good question! Maybe months we’ll know more. Yeah, problem always allergies.

Curious not? used get sick time commuted public transit wearing mask simple easy people close 100% survival area, messaging vaccines reducing severity illness really good. Unfortunately vaccine hesitant people refusing wear masks largely group. general particular group thinks pandemic non-issue. honest, I’m sure headline going effective. headlines see really causing vaccine hesitancy area blood clot ones. well shit! right though know baby hospital, right?

Home births, doulas, birthing centers. lot options.

Unpopular opinion verified. history never anything unless personally benefits ego. one surprised this.  don’t think used widely, see rare cases? Would interested see numbers though   would suspect poorer countries might underreport cases deaths related covid Yeah, we're seeing single digit percentage vaccine hesitancy. think people trust NHS, NHS trustworthy constant entire lives. According source provided OP, ~70%+ college students still drink (down ~80%), really understand ""barely thing""...

That said, think moderate drinking college bad thing. Maybe fewer people developing drinking problems? So, study Lancet says transmission covid19 largely airborne (transmitted micro aerosols) would safe distance assume range virus transmission? neighbor window several meters apart mine, would possible get covid neighbor would stretch? God, worst part premature thinking types personalities least resilient dealing changes narrative. Irresponsible selling people idea right now. take walk appointments shots doctor's offices Considering 80% adoption, that’s enough fully vaccinate nation tell them. can't turned away. know Washington Oregon checking residency. state? think possible, think criminal governments vit drives awareness programs since last summer.

But thing is, northen-lat people make much vit summer months either.

I'm way ready believe lifestyle going more-indoors cold weather plays higher role. Private events, public events, commuting methods. share *ton* winter cold climates. mom born 1957 remember that, sickly life. know better. hopefully Anyone thinks people 18 ones seriously impacted rockers. many ways, kids greater resilience adults. Lets keep focusing kids, though, adults raising remain messed ever... kids really messed forever.  Dear doctors, please let evolution thing stop burning trying stop weeding stupid people. long run it'll make better place. Ritual Bath? looking like Iran last spring. Someone needs set controls there. mean tell me, go ANOTHER COUNTRY get vaccine province (Canada) gives one? Make make sense JT. sorry not. even people? COVID inevitably going circulate people like this, keeping cases constant low even available vaccines. open say, fuck em? ideal, still massive improvement.

These things negative effects heart--they raise blood pressure harden arteries.

Maybe opiates benzos higher still lower past generation. Zoomers aint got shit crackhead Xers younger boomers that's sure. Aw man guys, running fear porn! doable. friends toddler who's 2.5. got used mask without making big deal it, bought bunch fun kid patterns, they're always good wearing masks model behavior. even goes hiking (or what's like long, meandering walks got toddler) mask on. kind process teaching kid manners.

Generally, there's issue parents kids wear mask, rather kids themselves. Watch do, say. really hope US solves whole gun violence mass shooting problem inevitable market crash seems like way many people set lose way much we've see leads.

Hah, kidding? We're screwed. really hope vaccinate enough get herd immunity.

But think least 25-30% country get it. there's people like, yeah I'll get it. serious procrastinators. think get 55-60% vaccinated gonna start slowing way down. Even major outbreak city, workplace 5 cases, 2 hospitalized still large number staff get vaccinated.

And really concerns me, covid mutates much. antivaxxers ruining things. face unknown.. better take precautions like wearing mask social distancing getting vaccinated?

No, think young people take experimental, emergency-authorized vaccination protect disease odds killing cancer does. old, immunocompromised, otherwise unhealthy, sure- take it. Cause post BS. Florida allegations completely unproven. Wow one employee decided speak never proven. going base arguments allegations stupid. referring sun sentienals investigative report lol that's neo liberal newspaper, like trusting Washington post report conservative news properly.

I hoping part new record day - Hopefully 5 million people US today! Today 8 days 2nd dose Pfizer. last stretch seems like lifetime!! literally get vaccinated outside public eye? exaggerating try make point seem robust. Social distancing one way avoid catching disease, well avoiding air travel. That's point guy making. also privilege vaccine already. I'm delighted security, don't, would wise continue exercise caution avoid catching covid specifically. Case counts still matter, mutations concern. vaccines proven effective variants, mean one come along escape antibodies produced vaccine. track little 150 current rate. think rate start slow soon though. 

Still think 150ish end April likely. Why?  It’s thread Florida. Free condoms maybe? Oh wait, Catholics... disagree. think people get vaccinated, hear outliers. ""Going normal activities vaccinated"" i'm guessing include getting organ transplant.

That's still pretty high risk scale. There’s massive introvert/extrovert split here. Honestly 2020 peak social interactions me. Easy excuse participate. Zoom gatherings easy regulate interactions. Mostly everyone online available, easy come go needed. Working home means don’t socialize coworkers don’t want to. Socially, it’s best time life I’m dreading “return normal.” 

That said, know it’s really hard extroverts I’m happy start thing again. Open all, meaning supply issues. adult get it. many children died virus? way going remain closed vaccinated. likely get injured die playing toys. 

It's really easy. Nobody forcing kid goto church bar street. stop trying force to. different stage pandemic recovery. Get it. Capitalism literally kill us. It’s true smoking good chunk Gen Z, especially, hooked e-cigarettes vape pens. vaccine works known variants. fact, works better flu shot flu variants rate nearly 20%.

Brazil barely vaccinating are, use Chinese vaccine lowest efficacy every known vaccine including AZ. Thank you! Small study, encouraging. Presymptomatic still issue seems, different flu. significant gap Newsom needs investigated logic 

Newsom probably needs investigated anyway, really deserve office cases &amp; contexts,. already (CDC says vaccinated around people also vaccinated.. unmask mingle distance requirements). 

As unmanaged events?.. that's probably going decision make depending level risk medical history. 

I'm vaccinated (and around office-work setting).. still Mask social-distance interact unpredictably random variety external people coming going space. (that,. employer still requires it). buildings still ""closed public"".. anticipate change maybe June 2021 (depending numbers data time, percentage population around us vaccinated).  parent fully believes wearing masks reaction still ""HAHAHAHAHAHA YEAH RIGHT!"" Good luck getting age group wear masks! Justin Timberlake this? /s acting like pandemic over. Presumably stopgap measure quarantine year? Yes it’s amazing yes Colorado

Good luck baby PREP requires screening every three months, catches cases otherwise going unnoticed. cases up, spread likely people would otherwise aware infected getting treated instead spreading it. 


Also, obsession treatable STI? relevance discussion attempting use example shaming people changing behavior. suppose denial way keep living world they've always known? 

Some feel like treating like big deal takes away ""freedom"". others bravado. Others believe sticking opposing political party (thanks party's political leaders thing) big government.

This new thing though. People make stupid health decisions time like taking medication correctly, quit taking early, refusing go doctor could serious issue even afford it. difference time choices affect people too. limits I’ve heard take 6 hours vaccine. It’s news consistently. 

From telling coroners report Covid deaths, swatting whistleblowers saying fudged numbers whatever latest thing last week. 

We’ve gone enough point, frankly I’m spending time provide sources another science denier whine here. 

Just go google, none deep hidden secret covered many times many news organizations point. agree you. People adaptable. Many really shit time, inevitable global pandemic goes around kills millions. think especially kids 13 going move pretty smoothly. think affected group people formative stages pandemic (high school/college). getting adequate social interactions age quite harmful future. Israel found Pfizer highly effective single dose? wonder Ebola vaccine also created problem? also uses Adenovirus. mom teacher, get anyone say safe kids together school. Everything kids had, had. used jokingly refer kids ""disease vectors."" (That became less funny 2020.) Plot twist: 2-4 yo wear facemasks. parents India, got one shot, I'm desperate get second fly there. Yes

Still 1 million go though (for there) billions around planet

Pfizer wants moonshoot 2.5 billion year... According positive rate 13.2%

Not good, terrible. seeing words ""skyrocket"" ""surge"" last year sure nice see word plunge. Outdoor activity banned able go Target fucking bananas. Shit gross. I’m really sorry.  Bhakt spotted. know else tested enough, want put body? [The fucking lots open appointments Tennessee, residency requirement. different rules state state, vaccine access significantly opened past week sure rules still same. click around pharmacy websites they’ll tell rules state, scope possible areas making travel plans ""We found protection population 80% higher younger 65 years, approximately 47% aged 65 years older."" 

That's uncomfortable low rate protection, especially among 65+ cohort, considering surge 1 2 lower mix variants. Good argument ""I already it, need vaccine"" belief. retrospect, see comments might misleading.  ridiculous thing I've ever heard. would love governor show exactly teach 2 year old wear mask whole time rather lock properly. “just flu” thing ignorant. It’s literally influenza virus. Literally. besides, influenza dangerous also kills lots people. probably don’t even know “the flu” is. 

If people want downplay it, say “it’s another coronavirus”, already known coronaviruses cause respiratory symptoms humans. would still ignorant coronavirus far worse previous coronaviruses. people heads far asses don’t know difference different respiratory viruses all, lump everything (probably along fucking rhinovirus) “flu”. 

There’s quote along lines “think dumb average person is. think approximately half people dumber that.” think previously gave much credit average person. billions ignorant arrogant selfish moronic fuckwads there. ""Parents help toddlers ease mask-wearing home, example masking short periods they’re watching favorite show."" significant component tobacco smoke gaseous state requires sorbent like activated charcoal adsorb it. Unfortunately, smell cigarettes even perfectly sealed P100 filter, although particulate component odor removed... smell changed little less obnoxious. Enjoy friend!! Well deserved. could finance it, able build shit.

You'd think AstraZeneca complete debacle people would understand amateurs charge vaccine production money answer problems. Covid 21? That’s awesome!!! Enjoy it! Thanks getting it!  You’re making unsubstantiated claims without references.

It’s possible hospitals taking young people would previously turned away. It’s also possible they’re taking proportionally number young people always have, there’s many cases total young people there’s also serious cases total young people. You’re genius! I'd hardly say hospitalizations up. They've pretty much plateaued since March less half February. They're admitting less severe cases beds hospitals nowhere near stressed. Would mind providing examples wasn’t legit?

YouTube videos “alternative news” won’t work either.

FTFY America never really “saved world” even once. I've come terms mask much protect me, way protect people *from* me.

I feel exposed around people without masks. compound issue:

If wear mask, they're either

1. ignorant, means know prevent virus, means there's much higher chance literally spreading I'm looking them
2. unable, means they're putting greater risk inability, means (see point 1) (see point 3)
3. uncaring, means care virus one reason another, means there's much higher chance literally spreading I'm looking them

It's bad situation around. make cute pets, believe put COVID cause death death certificates way make money, someone pays COVID deaths causes. words, think COVID deaths over-reported. It’s three word, tongue-in-cheek response really uninformed behavior. 

/s shrill... 32 verge kids...I going LIVE Same. feel fine today! They're also arguably ethical would agree help, they're selling cost price profiteering vaccines. Lol people still think tv even fair reporting? naive like, you’re fat old probably safely outside without dying. probably mean literal probabilities. actually smart vaccines. People understood risk taking, kid higher chance surviving 7 17. inevitable world control had. 
Now, would insanely risky safe effective vaccine. NO! vill haff KOMPLIANCE! That's fair. No, didn’t think either. right social media reason decline, it’s problem. one easily solve, especially moment. is”they”? Well think decade we'll make great scientific advances could likely able beat cancer 2030. already see recent developments. good options didn’t prioritize children’s health enough.  weeks guys! serious time! It’s low risk people really need take vaccine. young ones ones likely keep virus going ultimately mutating. would require selfless act. don’t know vast majority young people willing this.

Hey dude read it! mean strictly read comments based opinion said!

I mean, do. drive without seatbelt. Legally, nothing stopping so. Cars still start buckled in, get noise warns every seconds. devices record whether buckled in. No, asked you’re bringing Texas thread Florida. 

I idea part reply that. don’t believe numbers coming DeSantis Florida. corrupt POS Thanks. Good know.

Fwiw, could try telling vaccine side effects always seen first 3-6 months, we're almost year clinical trials. That's doctors concerned ""long term vaccine side effects""... that's really thing. anyone know states covid still causing deaths it’s unvaccinated people mix vaccinated/unvaccinated ? rest Canada maybe. Ontario? much. live United States guarantee 100% United States also undereporting, intentionally non intentionally!  ""Oh, fatty, get sick!!!!!!!"" works. They're gonna meet whatever deity believe they're gonna like ""Dude vaccine fucking idiot lol"" they?

Someone posted “alternative news” source really tried hard show pretty much bullshit. Terribly. forget everyone's alcohol drug tolerances super low. Everyone sloppy. cant wait haha.  try respectful box ""persons like you"" group? 
Also, please, exagerate write despective words ""you live rock?"". Otherwise stop discussing you. Thanks.

It seems Science matter %, rather uses words ""never"" ""forever"" ""all"" ""nothing"".

If want, could post link effectiveness vaccines different variants, seems effective.

""Data Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine team suggests protects well new UK variant. offers less protection South Africa variant - although still protect severe illness."" source: seems way test clotting reactions, don’t know test given inoculation difficult test run.

Maybe need run test symptoms appear, work homeless?

More information needed. 16 days exact thing - great time!! It’s 200M unique people. It’s 200M shots. Moderna Pfizer use completely different technology J&amp;J’s vaccine,

Amazon fulfillment centers account huge chunk transmission, restaurants bars drop bucket, remember reading.

This CYA theater. everything shit show already many states we've already running oxygen vaccine. 1m less 1st dose last week wow. reason why? JJ pause? vaccines save day, I'm worried.  think exporting vaccine demand wanes south. move Somalia won’t things again. Give Venmo address I’ll see Kickstarter help offset moving expenses.   quite moot. 10M J&amp;J vaccines sitting providers’ freezers, J&amp;J another ~4m ready ship. That’s enough fully vaccinate several small medium sized states. I'm saying US done July

And supply exceeds demand, start sending vaccines around world yet nobody rioted worry bLaCk lIVeS mAtTeR people still saying vaccinez work, christ.... Tweet deleted. there's also lot people think I'm reacting say got strong side effects.

First shot second? Lots people get second shot side effects, heard anyone complaining first shot. looks like they're similar problems rest world dealing with. alot people regardless order was. never wore masks, never distanced, met people indoors etc. like toilet bowl that’s clogged still don’t understand people say “I don’t want take vaccine people have”.... 205 million nothing? virus us 18 months now, single variant demonstrated anything marginal differences vaccine efficacy. rate mutaution going suddenly change dramatically.

We already built giant vaccine factories hitting stride. Even troublesome variant emerge next year two, unlikely could become problem prior targetted boosters.

All statements apply rich countries. Developing world still ride next year. Oh, love internet!!!!!!! Cool? vaccine isn’t guarantee, wear mask another 2 months. It’s hard.

Where Maybe wants die? 'This conspiracy goes higher thought!' indoor restaurant runs risk now, even mention it? govt fudged deaths doctors too, people disrespected negligence officials even public wearing masks. states facing Italy-like situation. want see too, I'm sure logistics extreme cold storage two shot vaccines work well appointment vaccinations.  seems like we're still operating regime lots ""easy"" people vaccinate. I'm curious see point things start slowing down. specifics it. Basically India insisting bridging trial done India use companies already hands full done existing trials elsewhere. many private companies making India ship countries. I'm guessing Indian government felt Covid cases control stuck Covishield Covaxin. Imagine weak stand one year isolation (if that) change! getting sick completely safe. crazy ones. I’m sick covid days ago flight Mexico US 3 weeks

Last time covid, still tested positive 4 weeks later.

I need negative test enter US - really need wait test come back negative despite sick 3 weeks (23 days later)? can’t afford stay longer departure date

Thanks! I’d agree leans way it’s far absolute statement . like anti mask sentiment 

I personally know people walks life refuse masks and/or don’t want vaccine 

You got careful polls tho, anti vax conservatives likely flaunt progressive lie preserve “wokeness”

I know early days pandemic I’d see people FB feed taking pictures people masks yet they’d throw private DJ parties garage . Ironically type people responsible 2 separate outbreaks town . Bible thumpers 

My point . really don’t know single people divides harm good normal people. People kids, jobs, etc.. fact judgmental probably know anyone. thing recommended talked amongst friend group.

Not anime children. odd I'm defending really enjoy animation (anime, disney, cartoons), definitely childish enjoy I'd hard time believing someone age never seen it. It’s BYOB you’re welcome hahaha vaccines US provide protection variants. already testing boosters future variants ready soon needed. underreported heavily, hiding cause death circumstances, check death toll covid death toll see discrepancies, apparent probably dumbest thing I've heard today. far homeless people won’t remember show 3 weeks second dose.  Hardly, trying promote CDC guidelines asking primary source balance demands also ask one OP. 
 
*Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong effectively covid they're serious containment.*.  Yes. ones get shot yet. glance over? *Every* elementary school's motto Indian govt trying hide crematorium building wall one city. situation almost like Italy faced last year. really really stressed variants... worry vaccine resistant variants become dominant able reach normalcy. Like never get back normal end pandemic new variant swoops sets us back again. logical? likely reach level normalcy variants kick us back lockdown? thing think maybe super crowded area/ northeast general hard space safely? I'm dense area Florida there's still enough space sidewalks stand feet apart people. I've never worn masks outside (unless shopping farmers market clusters people). Definitely stop wearing them. Stop promoting behaviors help control pandemic supported science. regret taking vaccine dying yes. unfortunately won’t able apply knowledge. scarred altered anyone age 18

It'd easier take seriously exaggerate much. makes position sound like fear mongering. favorite number article:

A total 7,777,177 vaccine doses administered long-term care facilities, agency said.  Pretty much. take ibuprofen early 30s sports day. Late 30s: 400 800mg? one didn’t hit Chief Possible, cause altered smell/taste due nerve inflammation, people reported altered smell/taste happens several days even weeks tested positive. helps, changes smell/taste correlated milder outcomes.  quote literally says AVERAGE age Covid dropping.

Now 70+ mostly longer get Covid, stands reason AVERAGE age Covid decline... India also massively underreporting cases/deaths. *Massively*. It'll years understand full scope country. crematoriums operating around clock, even account unreported deaths rural areas. Ooh edgelord Uhhh, going work say ""mask distance 0 covid cases."" people acting like decent strategy?

Don't strawman me. said everybody bare minimum, handle better get back normal. want shit open masking helps that.

The longer people resist bare minimum, onerous restrictions economy freedom handle issue become. Arguing decent strategy even stupider. would place states much closer MI month so? Like said [it going lapse lifted want go garden center buy houseplants. they'll right Ontario type complacency. Yeah, think that's perfectly great! I'm at, can't really walk around outdoors sans mask without lot dirty looks.

fwiw, actually posted slate article r/politics got downvoted hell haha I've seen P.1 taking foothold places B.1.17 already prevalent, P.1 seems 'struggling' spread places B.1.17 dominant variant. [B.1.617 seems terms contagiousness, though. Great see police lose mind unlike leaders country/province. Uncontrolled spread bad idea. Every new infection opportunity new dangerous variant. variants high vaccine breakthrough capacity, right now, (and ""an give fuck"" attitude COVID-19 best breeding ground that) well might. LOL think 'control group' real life 'study'? missing moon means traveling among stars.. really need fire whoever math mission lol Woohoo pandemic over! going able walk outdoors without masks?

I think bigger problem allowed entity absolute say life.

To degree question indistinguishable toddler addressing parents husband experience second Pfizer shot Wednesday morning. feel first one, definitely sting second, decent bit blood later took bandage. 

Very likely due placement shot, can't imagine anything concerned about. knew would happen consider worrying. elderly already vaccinated well anyone identified ""high risk"". annoying likely achieve true hard immunity vaccination can't force people care others right thing.  one dose mRNA vaccine effective one dose Johnson &amp; johnson? Wait, thought spread farts..guess I'll move mask ass face now. Dude... dozens friends Florida like actually LIVE know what's happening. Northeast.

Kinda crazy much norms different different areas. started pandemic Oregon, people wore masks outside (but would wear indoors). Moved Northeast, basically everybody wears masks time None matters. fewer overall infections... Michigan indeed disaster, thankfully, state facing disaster. Imo, Michigan locked given priority vaccines feds order fight surge WEEKS ago. didn’t happen, poor state suffering it. please don’t point Michigan example what’s going nationwide. Nowhere else country bad spot Michigan. Correlation ≠ causation Easy target sure primary source please... Biden administration working it. They’re currently getting around language “loaning” doses Canada Mexico. Normalcy bias actually one biggest conditions afflicts every generation time crisis, especially health one (the ongoing climate crisis see behavior). look anything convince there's nothing truly unique situation. seen someone walking outside sidewalk mask 10 months. hell live?  I’m negative person means deaths rising Michigan.

That’s different clotting factor. People Factor V generally anticoagulants medications prevent clots. probably talk doctors. MTHFR mutation, family members Factor V. don’t think CDC recommends yet,

Obesity pretty much number 1 risk factor. fat categorically bad. thats bad idea cause economic/political toll gov would greater, 1st goverment job care people 1st, countries.
Closest scenario helping closest countries, highest human flow country. safe, what?

The risk serious adverse reaction vaccine sooooo small compared risk serious COVID next 3 months. 

I think people (like you, like me) really, really bad understanding difference small risk (your risk die COVID) 1,000 times smaller risk (your risk die vaccine problem).

Masks protect 100% . Vaccines also don't, they're much better protecting masks ""being careful"". Please go stand line 4 hours, listen couple good podcasts meantime get protection yourself, others. oh, free.

If that, thank service (to society / community), bottom heart. death, neurological disease, loss senses, prolonged symptoms last months, spreading loved ones?  pretty reasonable things afraid of. American get completely botch response covid, rank worst world illness, get saved science. like perfect metaphor American society. Complete irresponsibility saved tiny sliver society scientists. ever say 60 minutes wrong? story lie/misleading, doesn’t mean everything say incorrect. obvious.... got norm wearing masks sickness think stay time Region dependent. occasional mask area case counts keep falling.

Disney Walmart keep charade while. Early 2022 seems right dramatic folks. fair, mother immonucompromised, make vaccine far less effective? really individual people much. mostly systemic infrastructure change. live...a tourist temporary visitor. omitted fact % people 50 least 1 shot significantly higher uk compared state u.s., which, due countries prioritizing populations, show americans vaccine hesitant anti-vax britons are. basically would explain everything fewer people want get vaccinated, 1 dose strategy wouldnt matter anyways I’m fully vaxxed went eat today!

Ok. I’m young people that’s party damn well feels like celebration right now! literally nothing comment regarding reason hospitals seeing increase number younger patients.

Canadian Police vaccinating people going say 10. Every time spike feel like explain it, adjust views. Yet time time things seem make sense. 

I think one biggest issues early models assumed homogenous mixing produced insane numbers cases getting forecast. cases come people thought might heard immunity. possibly people susceptible COVID. early cases helped think, nearly level predicting. 

I think mixing non homogenous, makes really hard make predictions month future. Wait Fun Police flex. partially states seeing declines new cases others increase. corona, u look glass half empty.

U say: 50 per cent ohiois (ohaioans?) vacconated. U say: 50 per cent ohioites vaccinated.

And virus teansmissed amoung 50 per cent France ANSM There’s lot visibility bias going on. BC measures Ontario either hasn’t implemented hasn’t implemented all, they’re visible general public. example, Dr. Henry’s authority close individual workplaces 3 people get infected.

Additionally, in-person worship services banned since November. still allowed Ontario, though reduction capacity taking effect latest measures. don’t shit open, won’t go there.

Who’da thunk? confirm, pretty much stopped drinking pandemic social drinker. actually pretty reassuring easy drink. two beers make pretty tipsy/drunk. Can't wait get back partying though actually come appreciate mess every weekend. meant big reduction deaths positive cases seen UK, 1-dose strategy (mostly) AstraZeneca Pfizer vaccines trialled covered 50% adult population. 2nd doses administered (3 months first) effects first vaccination staggering, cases deaths plummeting weeks 20-30 times daily deaths UK, pretty sad proved many thousands could saved US followed 1-dose prioritisation strategy too... think point contention around single fact negates entire broadcast show 50 year history accurate reporting?

Because you’d believe order think anyone “proven wrong” here. Young Floridian. It’s slower going hospitals COVID, I’ve never turned away whenever needed admitted. Sure. Since anonymous effectiveness vaccine might understated somewhat since people gotten yet might alter behavior. Also since people contact covid prioritized, would also cause results understated. since workers areas covid prioritized, results would understated. Wait, I'm seeing pattern here. Yeah agree. feel bad who’ve influenced anti-vax propaganda that’s bubbling beneath surface things long time. Many never questioned shot they’ve ever received lives, suddenly question ones. Covid-19 cause brain damage, least hope affect right parts women's brain appear beautiful them. Yep, effective, properly worn mask still best defense, vaccine close effective, better, depending immune system.

That said, vaccinated, touch fomite elevated risk, like POS terminal, still 1:10000 chance infectious transfer someone infected used terminal. risk high, high airborne transfer? No, depends risk tolerance. worth wash hands touching POS terminal.

Hey, Dougie cares us Ontarians, together, first make hard decisions /s Yep, getting first doses done quickly great, faster give them, robust supply chain 3 months line, easy thing predict madness 69.420% 6/14

Nice also appear much less likely carry virus--but still possible. thing people need remember pandemics squishy. work absolutes, work individual level. can't say ""I'm vaccinated, I'm safe everyone's safe me""; **can** say enough people vaccinated, cases deaths start dwindle consistently, Israel.

Canada second fastest vaccinating nation g20 past week 2, behind US. enough doses nearly 80% Canadians FULLY vaccinated.  Canada probably opening first dose appointments general public late May, early June latest (depending large/broad priority groups are).

Just Pfizer we’ll getting enough first doses 25% adults May alone, likely going May 32 - 35% first dose. add Moderna, possible J&amp;J likely NovaVax shipments (and AZ though won’t useful first doses unless change guidelines take it), Canada means ‘Fucking hard’ True. way Canada going... may best option. get there?

Quebec 75k vaccines, people Montreal still complaining seeing empty vaccination centres. bodes well ability massively ramp vaccination capacity short notice. European vaccine manufacturing par USA, european vaccines also exported, unlike currently happening USA. agree mostly. main problem poor countries led horrible leaders steal given vaccines try profit them. 

For us gift vaccines, needs agreement place they, WHO, whoever, comes handles vaccination efforts. post link think start soon. Jabs probably prevented another big wave (in states). simple concept.  people get it, likely thing mutates further. Eventually get much dangerous virus mutation. Got second dose two days ago. Felt icky yesterday, feeling great today. around two weeks, I’m going go fucking crazy Tinder, Bumble, Hinge. think much hesitancy lack infrastructure. eradication virus. exist rest life. 

The quicker accept this, quicker get back life. Aldi suburban Palm Beach County yesterday two seniors ranting would never get vaccine they're STILL flu. 

My mother, severely immunocompromised, refuses get apparently woke symptoms yesterday. try find way convince get tested hundred miles away without exposing half vaxxed ass her. number Ontario skyrocketing - hopefully get many needles arms quickly. 

I would love see open anyone wants one. Yeah makes sense cause less stuff coming system. Man hate young people huh Well, least ones still alive. without victimhood claim ephemeral moral high ground?

That said believe- see first hand- problems lock caused. vaccination passport indeed controversial.

Some months ago, many organizations (I think even WHO) showed criticism due lack effectiveness discriminatory.

Even EU says passport required travel. seems changed point view.

As mentioned, fact vaccinated prevent virus contaminate others, indeed use masks PCR seems appropriate even people vaccinated. Even article admits we’re battling issue testing reporting lot countries (typically poorer ones). that’s case, along confounding factors like poorer countries less likely vax likely worse medical care hunger, don’t think say rise Brazil’s infant deaths due P1 alone. evidence P1 evolved become deadly infants specifically - think we’re seeing result country poorer infrastructure struggling widespread covid lack vaccines. think transmitting real problem there. asymptomatic case big deal till give granny. Large scale vaccination still saves lives costs...

Nevertheless, think would wise use J&amp;J vaccine older folks lot European countries suggested AZ. Rome issue years. pandemic aggravated it. AZ JnJ, they've seen temporal connection (i.e. happens within week two vaccination) rare type clotting, much greater expect random chance. also seems particularly affect young women.

What makes things especially ethically complicated, within low Covid prevalence population (e.g. Norway), may risk complication comparable risk firstly catching Covid, seriously affected, younger age groups - Covid risk low.

As AZ, pause JnJ allow health officials get better idea (very small) risk, update recommendations regarding age groups etc, resume rollout. know what? They're going fine. cares? really know voted Hey, always curious since Northern Exposure! Alas, I’m America. South Korea probably won’t start vaccinations 65 Nov — plans, contracts, inventory atm KCDC MOHW constituency Administration. People happy here. definitely. bit cloth lol stops getting spreading illness fuck it. Least do. I.never said businesses ""should shut down"". said businesses right shut (and depending business, think maybe should). sit nothing saying use r&amp;d manufacturing produce products protect people. Well guess what. get make decisions. do. like every business world.

I know think fun try paint Democrat republican fit little box made me. 

Try think yourself. whatever think makes initial post work thinking yourself. say piece let go. go everyone what’s best family already made choice. Proudly vaccinated. choose live consequences crop like choosing refusing shot. know resident requirements california someone stayed families house hotel put address would zero questions asked. Remember open everyone, even homeless people without insurance tourists would go fine made sense vaccinate older ""at risk"" people 1st (along medical-responders front-line workers). think ""bad decision"". we're making great vaccination progress NOW.. stuff we're stuff 6 8 months ago (delayed due abysmally idiotic leadership).

Be may. .there still fault correctly pointed younger people ""mingling"" unsafely. live downtown area go walk around Friday Saturday night,. Bars clubs ""social-spaces"" packed gills unmasked people. That's recipe successfully beating pandemic. 

I mean get it.. ""pandemic-exhausted"" (or whatever they're calling now). Here's problem though:.. virus get ""exhausted"". cause ""inconvenient"" think is. It'll still everything possible infect kill people. ""long tail"" eradicating virus going slow painful nobody follows rules. Like real estate - location, location, location.

I recall seeing graph showing rate new infections would decline around 10 days first vaccination (think Pfizer Moderna). sounds promising, supposed full immune response place week two 2nd dose. general guideline would mask safe, would suck get virus close full immunity.

If mean mixture vaccinated unvaccinated people, think unvaccinated people would higher risk contracting virus getting severely ill, whereas vaccinated would greatly reduce chance getting virus even greater reduced chance severe illness.

Basically, mantra would everyone vaccinated, probably forego masks.

It’s four weddings funeral Hard say without context they're probably speculating vaccine becoming another annual shot. possible may happen yet data show necessary. sneaky edit, haha Canada: Vaccines 90% effective preventing hospital death get dose least June. Also Canada... we're F'd entire summer didn’t get pulled, recommended pause study rare cases blood clots. 6 cases almost 7 million people vaccinated still extremely rare, CDC FDA extra cautious make sure vaccine risky administer. likely unpause next week inclusion warning PSA symptoms look for. yea obviously lmao *you're* reason people can't find shots!

At least, please hold till they're longer urgently needed vaccinate people! kind subtle anti-Asian racism see everywhere. Since appreciating another culture mean idolizing it? you’d study design theory, lot stuff younger people like better done people aren’t America. people America aid similar skill, yes. people get attention support marketing agencies? No. posting link Russian website. Right.  site Levada Center. know, organization conducted poll article uses fails link BS statements like ""the best world""  person's opinion. They're free consider whatever best worst.

And free call is: BS  vaccinated? I've 2 moderna shots (fully vaccinated). 1 Pfizer 2 weeks ago getting second exactly 1 week tomorrow. got J&amp;J couple days pulled it! I'll fully vaccinated three week. Anyone fully vaccinated yet?  expand it? I'm interested subject, appropriate background.

I reading one conversation someone working Oxford (looked like similar area, directly vaccine) back December also expressed personally would feel slightly safer taking mRNA vaccine. relation HLA-B27 antigen.

I also wondering vaccines far cause blood clotting, even though know virus causing spike protein makes autoimmune system go high wire could possibly take year get vaccinated ? think Trump would throw away vaccines placed orders banned export? got moderna vaccine today drank 3 glasses wine later day. didn’t think effects vaccine I’m concerned. However, feeling chills sore arm work? screw over? sure ask since google doesn’t definite yes/no answer  think $30 cost mRNA vaccines. oxford J&amp;J ones cheaper. America ever going help Canada send like week's worth vaccines? could quite literally stop massive 3rd wave Corona end new draconian lockdown + re-open Canada/U.S. border... Confirmed going huge undercount compared predicted. Don’t scared. ready skewed view, Canadian didn’t know this... actually agree? crazy ""If 80% fatalities occur 40% population, yes, vaccinating 40% population enough reduce number fatalities 80%. leaves 60% population unvaccinated, yes, healthcare systems longer over-loaded 60% still catch virus low risk anyway. Buy that's all, virus 40% less people spread through, may provide sort dampening effect reduce rate infection among still susceptible virus.""

I want make clear completely agree here. already past point point hospitals run. vaccinated old people way better position ever been. used 3000 people day die. 1000 deaths never going go 1000 thanks vaccines. wish media, public health officials politicians better job saying allowing us celebrate good news. 

We 100% agreement vaccinating vulnerable. basically done stage stage people get vaccinated steeper decline cases deaths less people worry. guess trouble emphasizing desire get vaccinated. damn easy idk. 

I also agree whatever reason get 65% vaccinated would still make sense keep things closed. move phase strict social restrictions. Vaccines saving us returning normal life, think better people vaccinated trouble understanding argument getting vaccinated would be. technically already possible california, rich mexicans others latin america driving flying texas get jab nobody checking id. said alaska first brazen already happening elsewhere Yeah agree. Surgical masks make difference much. Yet people think they're effective vaccines China stopped reporting around time media eyes Italy plight virus. don’t see way shape form China less 100k dead COVID. 

Their country ground zero. 2nd populous country world much populous cities way dense New York. 

And sub moderated, saw complete collapses hospitals posted Chinese nationals using VPN. Corona virus- flu shape outer virus.
Where getting info - Fox Spew ? mean okay, reasons tumours die. US leaving Europe dust Rorschach, Hell YA! Sure closing golf courses playgrounds going single thing? Wow amazing job America! Meanwhile Canada, even vaccinated frontline workers 🙃 That's almost bad cancelling. That's basically throwing away revenues/profits ticket sales. Unless cable channels willing pay more, Olympics even money pit already are. I’m also imagining lawyer Pfizer Moderna hearing JJ wanted help lowers glasses says “fuck no”. liability would insane. think correct say number new cases US ""growing pretty fast."" 7-day average new cases around 71k around 66k two weeks ago. post covid world, immune surpressed people wear n95s forever ridiculed staying safe, everyone accepts going another wave. smh I'm going hide inside tin foil hat. subthread started poster claiming mRNA vaccines *cause* rare blood clots pointing study say all. another poster came provided another link even mention blood clots all. clear agenda I'm going engage fear mongering. fact mRNA vaccines causing CVT frequency occurrence vaccinated population remains well within background rate. couple studies done protective effects childhood vaccines covid. MMR one. So, could potential reason Brazil’s babies faring worse - maybe they’re getting typical childhood vaccines countries give kids.

More evidence protective effects childhood vaccines often babies higher mortality rate toddlers children. theory behind certain vaccines given later gave, first couple years life vulnerable, since they’re fully vaxxed yet. people might assume free implies catch. might want look actively enrolling 12s now, select cities. enrolled mine, hope testing area. cousin actually came recently got J&amp;J shot. signed online never mention resident give address prior infection alone protective J&amp;J alone, mean together even better.

I mean shoot, vaccine bumps covid-recovered person 80% 95% protection (random number, spitballing here) that's totally worth book. people allergic reaction right shot could cause something like that. PEG shot (also dr pepper ingredient go blood quite fast) apparently causes it. Sounds like fine though. wish students would start wearing catch flu. One person catches flu know I'll next weeks. Sure, mask information here: ""Studies stated cloth face masks ineffective prevent influenza-like diseases compared surgical masks (relative risk 13.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74–100.97). Moreover, filtration efficacy cloth face mask found low 3% laboratory based filtration test cloth masks, could poor quality cloth used making face mask.[11]"" 

That's paragraph relevant claim anyone reading full text would understand N95 surgical mask really option actually trying make difference. mind feel though might prudent take one two approaches: either transparent community concede masks genuinely work specific conditions simply wearing facial covering really takes, drop mask mandates proper PPE can't worn widespread basis due visible real polarization creates.

As far numbers go, like think understand math quite well also. working data scientist 3 years spent 6 years prior obtaining necessary credentials role complete advanced degrees. thesis statistical modeling. matter dividing population equally across percentage scale. group weighted accordingly. majority fatalities 50+ age group (fatalities, cases), are, massively, correct think such: 

If 80% fatalities occur 40% population, yes, vaccinating *only* 40% population enough reduce number fatalities 80%. leaves 60% population unvaccinated, yes, healthcare systems longer over-loaded 60% still catch virus low risk anyway. Buy that's all, virus 40% less people spread through, may provide sort dampening effect reduce rate infection among still susceptible virus. 

In opinion, psychological economic costs keeping going much longer incredibly dear. pretty convicted best way go forge ahead vaccinate risk fatalities bar set ""70% vaccinated"" rather ""80% highly susceptible groups vaccinated"". point open handle rest comfortably, feel would reasonable balance safety rest things also matter Great business plan indeed Yeah, retail employees exist abused tantrum screams mom never taught manners style hair. article actually says towards end program available domestic international visitors. See June! (I guess there's also test program happening end April Guage interest idk details that.)

Edit: I'm Alaskan clear. made lava.  gist pressure exerted anyone family want visit mainland needs get Chinese-made vaccine instead one procured western company. won’t make much difference, absurd requirement order magnitude. Imo difference tiny fraction AZ sent. majority still rotting away warehouse. Thrombocytopenia harmless either though, ur blood actually barely thrombocytes, means blood can't even clott all, u get wounds internally u basically bleed death, dangerous. 
I'm nurse working stroke unit That’s usually is. sites may disclaimer it’s 100% guaranteed search tools look availability area based kind vaccine you’d like. booked several appointments friends family always knew signing That's anecdote. saw survey somewhere (lol sorry) back all. Might mean, keys fucking awesome Check health department website what's required whatever state going in. Every state different. would say Millennials Gen Z idolize Easy Asian cultures though. there's huge divide older millenials. grew stuff like anime Japanese video games imprinted uniquely Asian (and specifically japanese) things heads normal elders exposed to. Likewise Korean culture similar impact recent years. think younger generations would uncomfortable adopting things seen ""asian""

That said, fact masks whether virus taken seriously politicized US partisan biases prevail. essence zero change 

This bullshit. Day-to-day life different people living Japan two years ago Remdesivir really short supply days India. people waiting hours queues purchasing black market 10 times price.

I somehow got due connection pharmacist, I've seen people begging it... 

So banning export medicine expected. Keep mind people 65 experienced serious epidemics before, heard directly previous generations seen vaccinations work. exactly people would expect highest responders.

I work senior living, people hesitated ones dementia really understand going on. residents wanted vaccine soon could get administered. prefer “The last man Earth”(1964) better adaptation book also Vincent Price great actor. assume Canadian, I'd pay I'm crossing border shot. Depends state even county point. require proof residence care/check. Go lick doorknob land border closed. That's literally it, extended one month time least 10 times.  curfew here. means see eachother day. use whatsoever. wait June 1st fly Alaska it. actually read article you? mention blood clots all. completely different condition want fly anywhere vaccinated. Sitting pressurized chamber bunch strangers seems like risky thing do. Since time travel yet invented, latter kinda irrelevant now. safe, go fun :) one USA paying vaccines rn. realize explain benefits splitting vaccine three sentence post above?

1. like message united Europe. message, without explanations health humanity side.

2. Poorer countries getting less also great benefit, hey, people poorer countries deserve live too.

3. vaccine used vulnerable group every country, happening, prevent way deaths using -for example- whole Germany France, watching another Bergamo go Italy Poland.

4. People likely high percentage interact lot people nationality, many reasons, first geografically course. vaccinated every European country lets say nice rate 60%, danger getting spreading infections already greatly reduced. vaccinate certain countries first rate -utopical- 100% others still 15%, much higher infection rate due geografical sources (people likely infect neighbour vaccinated person 500 km away different country, clear point). see spreading vaccinating everywhere helps vaccinating one country noticing bad effects causes countries.

There many reasons it. ethical simply root humanity lot. Either stand it, not. part try rethink stuff notice looking equally nations. think thought you’d wear one you’re sick. Like flu go grocery store work. It’s really quite rude circumstances. Sigh. re-run Zika scare? know, virus Brazil media told us would doom North America within months?

Maybe media re-run? clicked story, revenue generated, know lol correct, came back see bunch votes hahaha. bunch sensitive idiots sub. mainly stopped posting actually stopped coming. First time back sub 7 months last. get vaccinated Texas. Texas too. together... Scientific studies measuring antibodies vaccination prior covid positive people said stronger reactogenicity first time. Texas already vaccinating people Mexico cross border. Rio Grande valley health department don’t ask questions. makes sense considering closely tied communities there. Houston vaccinate regardless status too. Come Houston. can't believe found twiv. Going back work much listen Wait really? Oh man, ever tried make 2 year old wear mask? Good luck moms dads. Remember hundreds thousands deaths? didn’t like like everyone know fully vaccinated refused get vaccine. agree. would prefer targeted? I’m American fiancée English. work Central America hope getting vaccine soon. already debating flying home state trying there. anything says tourists can’t get vaccinated states? California would booming vaccine tourism Totally agree. way China lost 90k. EU made vaccines rescue! Hmmm, maybe ""even get vaccine still wear mask, maybe 2022"" best message all. It'll new normal. funding September additional funding. got money already. Yes BioNTech made statement September mean get money before. also got money build manufacturing infrastructure. CureVac got also funded german government. Man Canad@ really made vaccines. think would deaths even locked down, everyone miserable lives fucked up. Lockdowns causing suffering corona ever could. Distressing though think challenge getting everyone fast. Especially poorer countries. Two McLaren mechanics tested positive pulled day free practice 1.. situation crazy fas lined outside hour gates supposed open cancelled anything collaboration. realize expressed anything collaboration. seem legit company. yet deliver ""safe effective"" vaccine. Far away meaning international? understanding, exactly wrong, also really correct, I'll try give context alleviate concerns. Please feel free PM afterwards.

Disclaimer: I'm medical professional, I'll refer details website European Medicines Agency , seems breaking differences quite well links end even 


Tl;dr (but please read link): 

Regular trials completely new drugs usually proceeding image posted, take long time scientifc basis need established, manufacturing processes need created medically tested, etc..  
This happening scientists relatively quickly able isolate generic sequence virus create vaccine based existing technology, therefore trial phases could cut shortened. 
The manufactures still recruit willing test subjects test monitor per usual, amount persons test cycles lower normal. IMO dangerous immeatate side-effects occur. 
But process special, every country needed approve expedited trials buying using vaccines.

We, patients, **not** part inital studies regarding effiency potential side effects. However, get vaccinated (at least EU), part ongoing study monitor effects vaccine. Nope! True basically intentionally failed, people spout lockdowns help.  important thing realise Merck German company, last ten years acquired Millipore Sigma Aldich American organisations represent vast majority Mercks life science business. couple years ago (I've worked couple years I'm certain beyond this) Sigma, Millipore Merck separate legal entities.

It's also important know products highest demand (filters, biocontainers, bioreactors) fall within Millipore portfolio. hate you. Haha yeah guess laws work people decide follow. plans can't trust self responsibility, otherwise would hundred thousands deaths Germany. guess would alright you. already complaining government help lose family member. write loudly enough. wonder President Joe Biden make good campaign promise...I guess wait see Britain government offered zero concession towards university fees sparked threats protests, rent strikes, etc. worth noting tuition fee prices set government.

Currently students take loan £9.5k per year (around $13k USD) that's university tuition. maintenance loan meant pay accommodation supplies likely amount per year, higher study far expensive city like London £1k month would probably get Harry Potter style cupboard stairs.

So imagine building debt £19k per year time graduate, almost £60k debt. Sure, pay back job paying £25k higher, apparently gets written 40 years appear credit report unless default mandatory £60 month payments threshold, that's still lot debt looming you. There's also risk government selling debt eroding financial regulations surrounding loans, could lead new buyers going full loan shark upon repay back.

Now imagine forking £19k per year loans kept like prisoner student halls attend fucking Zoom classes. expert logistics vaccine production, vaccine widely available around globe day 1.

That's answer question. great idea product nothing unless get execution right, involves production logistics. according image caption administering biontech-pfizer Good point governments funded vaccines adding joint response?

What collaboration? Lockdowns can't fail, failed. clinical trial one sure ruled link casual causation vaccine. Given long period time gender wonder explored coincidence. One highest foreign aid budgets West, mind you. argument make sense, UK government collaborating countries world regarding testing variant profiling, mention trying sign trade deals, especially Asia. Every government outside territories Atlantic provinces completely shit bed. failed go human nature. plan relies 100% compliance us bad plan. would let adults decide much risk take own. increase cases far outpaces increase testing. That's there's also increasing trend deaths. disagree. Holding back 2nd doses give 1st doses gives higher overall protection right now. people immunized even partly faster get spread control. simply continue ramping vaccine production facilities deal variants. beyond economic industrial power many countries 10 times current rate production enough time passed fully scale up.

Science given us tools weapons needed fight this. needed sustained hearts people places power make happen. People discussing Vaccine passports UK today. Church leaders declared unethical. understand (please correct statements incorrect) vaccine:

1. prevent catching Covid-19. stops symptoms becoming dangerous you.
2. prevent infecting someone else covid-19.

In opinion, vaccine passports thing problematic may cause vaccine opponents double due link conspiracy theories (number beast, etc).

I think signed disclaimer form proof negative test would better. Without vaccine, able attend event likelihood contracting covid high stating accept may die result attending hold neither attendees organizers responsible.

Feel free disagree. :) Wording title awful Well fail? Maybe people follow rules? would done differently? pretty happy got vaccine fast expectations years. complaining better isolation least danger others. beginning. numbers see following weeks gonna terrifying even probably reporting Social life insignificant, literally one things people need maintain mental health. Yet asked put hold indefinite amount time make business owners, want lose profits pandemic.

Plenty businesses relatively unnecessary closed, little value would lost. There's reason ad agency office open pandemic. Plenty factories produce consumer goods could safely shut several weeks. Construction work new office building could probably halted time. Yet mysterious reason, politician even considers thing. plebes expected sacrifice health economy, stay home also sacrifice well it. Sputnik V also approved produced India. reason approve Pfizer&amp;Moderna. would result scams/fake vaccines India. serum institute suited make mRNA vaccines. Two AZ cases men. governing bodies duty protect too. Realistically, odds happening either gender extremely low, lower one gender mean crossed threshold acceptable risk. governments decided safe enough genders, decided neither, perhaps eventually decide safe enough one willing deal logistics problems would entail. Also cutting foreign aid 50%. generally tone UK inward lately. Ok, well that's new. got card batch number date scrawled biro that's it. curiosity: owned Merck KGaA (the german Merck american one) several years now. laws still fully apply them? industry decade old american company probably huge ties american market mean foreign company bought american one still even factories outside US need follow US laws fully american company? see very, people 2. awful lot loose droopy mask and/or nose hanging out. Damn. last leg race sounds brutal guys. got mine grocery store pharmacy, didn’t check ID once. also didn’t check essential worker letter. CDC chart hospitalization rate age telling. 

The rate 65+ dropping faster groups may even catch rate 50-64.  posted argument showing study figures mean. 

You’re going stop oldest academic institution publishing scientific studies? Hmm ok bro. misleading title gives impression 1 person fully protected. impression previously infected persons would fully protected, would mean contract covid again, may get sick again, maybe less seriously (shorter duration, fewer symptoms, etc). opinion, misleading. Nothing makes sense anymore 😔 Isn’t normal?

9 got sick fully vaccinated
244 got sick vaccinated. 

That 9/244 97% efficacy rate. 

Assuming populations similar behaviour say that’s expected It’s certainly possible certain industries college education doesn’t much premium others point overall college education entails better opportunities along higher salary. also find hard believe there’s industry somebody without college education would better advantage candidate college education. many employers don’t make college education requirement, I’m saying entry level, employers would still likely prefer college-educated candidate because, again, signalling. two candidates equal

Of course I’m trying say are, I’m trying make point college education makes person better candidate general didn’t get college degree. Freedom speech. move love. point none us know truly right. We’re best keep people alive immunocompromised friend needs hers.

The focus boomers huge mistake. math make sense include long term survivors experience (including possibly lower life expectancy). 78 year old need vaccine, ton manual labour? See that's problem, feel need mention family simple discussion stated opinion something. Mostly whenever anyone mentions family friends work anything could validate statements anonymous platform, people respond did.

I could easily convenient said flimsy card gave us, *suddenly know what's going due work*.

Guess I'm like respect. stating believe, based told 3rd party, anonymously social media platform. work claimed profession? idea. family member stated, idea.

BTW never stated family member high ;)

How silly respond did. prefer ignore stated claim employment, rather call liar. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

As individuals forging official document, work like that. People buy forged documents, criminals make forged documents sell. working like centuries across world. good we're talking public health like, set aside feelings look numbers. couple football teams playing empty stadium. literally 10,000+ athletes crew every corner world descending country virtually vaccine coverage. Sounds ideal want spread variants concern back around world end. anecdotes contribute nothing argument. Even Facebook profile profile Facebook made. Likewise, simultaneously Twitter account without wanting everyone know terminal cancer, transitioning, AIDS, etc. mutually exclusive, gotcha argument think is.

Good Walgreens area filling medical information forms you, though. 

Likewise, even need buy counterfeit COVID test [the real one 67% false negative 

I worn mask, gloves, public since knew virus early January. Public official said masks would help general public, worn us. Then, argument masks helped keep infected person wearing spreading it, help prevent wearer catching it. Now, advice wear 4 masks.

While Tankies like understand points smell like boot; advise make soap box toilet paper next time.  Seriously, giving boomers first huge mistake. retired shut fuckin door wait, young people ones need work run economy end 60 years ruined lungs 80 year old live 86 (meanwhile long haul covid guy may end dying 64 due weakened lungs) point might well bring back flagellants. FromtThe picture Using simian adenovirus delivery system. That's super important bit. AZ uses acme simian adenovirus, vaccine attempted use one ebola vaccine.

I'm saying bad use (it's bad use it), specific adenovirus seen lot use this, instances used rare clotting issues. critical need cases like this, I'd still say risk acceptable, we're going see delivery method something like chicken pox vaccine. That's true. Mortality rate people around 80 (the age pretty much every night may last) around 20%. That's ""most"". concern. Here’s hoping info spreads among testing medical personnel fast source that? Asymptomatic reinfection lead long Covid transmission. extremely myopic focus symptomatic cases. 

The real question we’re marines caused 48%(!) positivity previously uninfected individuals study period? Clearly significant behavioral changes needed among marines matter public health national security. Things changed sure. see westerners there, know lots us. I'm white blonde. I'm Hindu. People welcoming, part, Indian national me, might why.

I hope go! Kumbh incredible. small part India got see one favorite trips ever. hope go back over. Masks also made compulsory Spanish flu like many things we're well (like avoiding handshaking). Spanish flu ended, everything went back normal. Sure! We'll also accept maple syrup and/or poutine. numbers already shocking we're steepest uptrend curve we've had. Ontario going heaviest lockdown province pandemic gave police authority ticket people nonessential reasons. doctors talking extreme ICU triaging sending patients palliation.  brutal. risk thrombocytopenia risk venous thromboembolism vaccination SARS-CoV-2 appear higher background risks general population One back clinical trial. know took place, says EUA. mean week. Possible less likely. study says thing.

It compares rate CTV mRNA vaccine recipients COVID-19 infected. doesn’t compare general population.

Your statement simply false misleading. Thank informed. people like even problem. Thank GOD President Trump! bc resident highly doubt we’d see riots bc restrictions. Thanks link right away? SK masking seemed handling things better, that's example followed early on. Never regretted that. Germany forefront vaccine funding developing.

Instead, US giving billions dollars several vaccine manufacturers, return guarantees first dibs. good deal making behalf US. cost pandemic far spending billion vaccines. Except kinda study doesn’t compare rate CVT mRNA vaccine recipients general population.

Your statement simply false. would work people actually wore wore properly.  in Brazil 1,300 babies died virus

That way expected read. find comments around UK approach eroding trust particularly interesting, given extremely high % getting vaxed group UK (as vaccines made available them).

Why? universities open too?

It's 1+ year since university closed closed least till september. Besides shitty education quality terrible notes, mental health never worse. one discuss asymptomatic issues. Nah, like think countries already waves virus already physically damaged population.
So multiple strain variant sweeps India already weaker earlier damage susceptible.
A population virtually exposure virus healthy individuals may survive even vaccines take account.
Purely speculative part fat 50 year old woman history asthma high blood pressure chest infections pretty sure pushing daisies catch it. I'm hopeful see steep dropoff soon. 80% 65 least one dose huge  I'm familiar blood clots. What's difference PF4 mention, CVT, [recent indicated occurs rare instances Moderna &amp; Pfizer? Unless live Washington California. feel sentiment still 'optimal' solution. Yes, father might little safe getting 2nd dosed. every person 2nd dose, can't 1st-dose another. talking 80% vs 95% two (yes know elderly vs young comparison) including vaccinated people spread less, easy calculation large population. stop spread, everyone benefits.  They’re targeting wrong damn things. also googled Israeli study you.  would reply comment depends vaccine compare familiar data one vaccine? I've pretty pessimistic/realistic whole pandemic, I'm pretty sure summer fine Ontario. We'll plenty vaccines Canada vaccinate everybody (1 dose least) July. Bad things happen city can't get shit together. 

Especially en route Oregon. China sweeping rug months anyone could react help. Things definitely start looking good Memorial Day. People don’t protest Upper Canada. They’ll grumble complain online, won’t anything trust government. Unlike Americans, Quebecers British Columbians.

We’d riots streets Vancouver implemented BC. Wow, that's surprising, feels shit somehow UK done worse even though we've stuck house arrest *months*, lost year University. Hi, question lot moving parts, hopefully helps clear things bit. 16+, depends state, eligibility opening quickly. example, California many states, anyone 16 older vaccinated.

Pfizer currently emergency use authorization 16 years old older. Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Astrazeneca 18+. Pfizer one include 16 17-year-olds initial clinical trials.

Last week, Pfizer requested FDA expand authorization adolescents ages 12-15, said would make similar authorization requests countries week.

Both Pfizer Moderna currently studying safety effectiveness vaccines pediatric trials. data comes out, better sense kids age 12 start getting vaccinated. hope helps! Exactly Agreed public facing worker vaccinated, aren’t yet. It’s within last weeks vaccine easily available; need time doses plus two weeks. It’s awhile now. got back Hawaii. fully vaccinated. conspiracy peddled European leaders protect EU criticism exerted control subsequently fucked procurement AZ [recent saying Pfizer &amp; Moderna's vaccine also caused blood clots rare situations. I'm sure J&amp;J asking help vaccine reviewed, vaccines looked closely. same! Prolonged sitting traffic also causes blood clots Can’t believe made year without catching lol tested several things still takes days go get tests done due lack energy much sweating. pass along monday likely tested that.

Today saw like usual looked like marathon. drenched sweat. change clothes day. Looks like aged 20 years. still lacking energy days. Poor woman hell showing sign letting up.

The hospital letting out. lots various tests still answers. mosaics floor also absolutely gorgeous. better protection four months helps actually live four months then.

Canada's recent weekly (p. 16) gives age breakdown deaths current week: extent known, 96% aged 60 older. see justify withholding second doses group order give first doses younger people. order 3 months later countries thanks EU. clearly exerted effort prioritize in-bloc vaccines (such French one) never took off.
 countries got priority (UK priority clause) EU aware time. AZ massively accelerated infrastructure order meet demand EU inevitably issues production.

UK got priority due priority clause. EU tried throw blame UKs feet distract errors, even threatening effectively civil war Ireland. work, politicians started shitting vaccine pretend matter anyway.

The EU fault taking procurement bloc delaying orders - please let pass blame  money.

It's *just buy them.* didn’t wash hands last year? Likely safe unless you’re packed like sardines. I’ve eating restaurants outside seating since last summer. long tables reasonable distance apart I’ve felt it’s pretty low risk  Delivery numbers vs administering starting look like might able small excess. Wondering built-up become enough warrant export opening heard lot people say politicians ""cutting line"", think priority, among first country get them.

Like getting vaccine somebody told could give dose Trudeau, would heartbeat.

I agree policies certainly vote in, know times, government operations crucial leader risk can't good. avoid taking ""core classes"" antibodies angry covid. ""B.1.617 eliminated T-cell."" situation kinda freaking sucks know call ask I'm gonna ask here. place, better places ask, let know.

I live parents. mom exposed 6th. symptoms, got call got told get tested, came back positive 12th. told quarantine 26th, 2 weeks. understand, also need quarantine time too, perfectly fine. got tested 12th found positive, turned negative fast accurate tests. We're really well isolation.

\*\*BUT\*\* issue one dose pfizer vaccine, need get second shot 29th. lot sources tell need quarantine 2 weeks \*after\* ends, even symptoms. means I'll miss apointment.

Is summation accurate need do? anything get around it? cannot stress enough important immunized asap, missing appointment could mean get immunized mid June, would \*\*anything\*\* avoid.

Is anything do? all? released like year? We’re sort plateau know that. live Alaska work aviation use week vaccine definition calculating efficacy. mean protection actually kicked point - look graph page 30 clear protection kicks around day 11. lot vaccination appointments getting filled though dunno that. alaska became flight hub logistical reasons pandemic remains seen planes rerouted actually profitable routes convenient pfizer. one talks dozens deaths norways nursing homes?

Good luck experiment... health care workers health levels ages. anything worse general public due Israeli Oxford study general public. creating new wikipedia page reasons visit alaska currently bullet point fully, does. Nothing protects 100%. read EU deported vaccines distributed locally. Tbf United States global hotspot relative EU countries. US legitimately needs vaccine tamp number people dying cause we're dumb asses keep letting spread. That’s whole subreddit nutshell. People restaurant selfish a-holes can’t stay home make poor bring things get sick. Selfish holes best place see stats almost every single vaccine that's ever existed happen, 99.9% sure cant spread covid, also Israel data backs mean... that’s true hurt you? No. stated study extrapolations. links far agreed assessment. I'm confused, Pfizer vaccine made German company called Biotech? German chancellor take Pfizer AstraZeneca? wonder many become ""that weird cold going around"" nobody even suspects something novel. tell me. said aren’t studies. are. inject little guys thighs. meet qualifications. Honestly, everything read makes think slow climb initial jump. might get protection later protection last days probably same. NYC vaccines demand right now, anybody get next day appointments now. Masks going forever associated Covid Americans. would rather put behind them. telling person caught first strain Covid-19 type physical damage ?

I think time prove wrong that. 
If illness body weakened susceptible second round infection.

Covid-19 shown cause heart, liver, lung brain damage people even know infection first place.

The people living slums Indian robust immune systems able survive conditions. current mutation causing issues people even really notice original Covid-19 strain.

I think one totally wrong case. precisely disagreement? strange, since died elsewhere. health care workers health levels ages. anything worse general public due exposure. 

But Israeli Oxford study general public. anti-vaxxers misinformation really starting worry me. can't seem help issue. thing isn’t stopping God damn it. 80k+ new cases today even nearly 40% population 1st dose natural immunity. literally lower cases month ago..  lot able get essential worker? Maybe different state since opened everyone 16+ yet. actually trialed, results look good. shots, shoot semen condom suck retain antibodies. helps I’m sure AZ Covid dumpster fire one point first thought covid nothing bad cold. heard people younger healthier dying woke up. Rode 5 miles day, everyday, bike, lost 50 pounds far know never got Covid. Still glad it. time better spent taking booster shots measles, tetanus etc antibodies gone within 20 years since last shot  amen! COVID shit ton contagious. Seasonal flu R0 around 1.5. COVID around 2.5-3.5.  Really!? I’m fully protected tomorrow? 😭 Alaska's tourism department: ""please?"" CDC found that, surface \*is\* contaminated COVID-19, odds getting way still 1 10,000.

Hi, find this? assume _want_ fix anything.

The rich getting richer expense pace corporate consolidation increased. elite, perpetuated long possible. B.1.617 joined chat lol tbh, lot knowledge like South Korea comes watching lot BTS content. several members would wear masks flying planes rehearsing bunch backup dancers, backup dancers would wear masks rehearsal sometimes. like, super common, also weird see someone wearing facemask public transit crowded situations. Would love case countries. like normalized. went 2 articles, stated before, extraploation. saying asymptomatic HEALTH CARE workers certainly CANNOT say would apply general population. Yeah. relatively lucky position (from international perspective) think makes sense see things shake out.

You're lucky rush vaccinate everyone another wave infections comes! Okay still studies testing likely person spread virus vaccinated. mean test negative COVID, still spread COVID? Begs question getting rid COVID.  thing? 100 year old grandma got second dose, she’s pretty frail, don’t think she’d well covid Still gonna pass one, dawg. 

All propaganda still doesn’t make fact virus doesn’t prevent shit symptoms jab bad symptoms fucking virus already!

Might well inject water good does. fun virtue signaling Instagram selfie tho! 🤷‍♂️ running oxygen sedatives. I'll take US healthcare system day. Makes sense me. That’s impossible confirm.

Find someone never leaves home doesn’t live anyone leaves home somehow manages get COVID particles inside home.

Sound nearly impossible? It’s cause pretty much is, that’s aren’t “confirmed” cases surface transmission.

If someone gets sick, almost definitely go grocery store, someone family does, immediately ruled surface transmission even though easily could’ve cause. also little sequencing tests thing. big box grocery stores, example, see staff aggressively cleaning wiping stuff ... people wearing masks nose covered. masks exhalation valve. plus US production supply chain capacity actually make here. common think. lot wear pollution poor air quality. Fuck. received second dose Moderna week ago. CLL. 

I talk PCP Oncologist next week. hopeful checked antibodies contribute study Bundesregierung doesn’t much say Bundesstaat policies, no? 

From gathered Germanophile, initial response went well due many states given Federal, Merkel’s consensus. Later pandemic, states began break thing. many threads news here, one 50 upvotes new variant avoids T-cells may make vaccine useless

""B.1.617"" wrong it’s crazy Mortality isn’t concern. disable too. Probably. Ya current estimate 80% first-dose US done end May. little increase supply + supply currently hand, reason open atleast Canada/Mexico I’m 2nd Pfizer shot noticeda couple hours became unusually angry. Anyone know anything that? I'm still experiencing mild moderate headaches Moderna shot #2 day 17 post shot. feel like shot never headaches prior feels intense reaction 24 hour period shot #2 milder.

Today bad enough sit hour hold head subsided. expected? LA County, reached 1% positivity rate today , lowest record since pandemic started.

As Angeleno, kind news love hear! 2nd shot Tuesday eagerly anticipating fully vaccinated uh... 10 days (if counted correctly) Lancaster county PA earlier today. Signs masks.... that's going many places....

Certainly showed depends heavily at. comment mean lmao could get flu shot. ""concern"" touting conspiracy theories quacks. That's either ignorance concern trolling. No,

Studies show first doses effective. Studies show 30 year olds getting hammered new variants.

While seniors definitely get vaccinated first. feels weird person sitting inside car I'm delivering online groceries vaccinated I'm working literal covid closet.

Second doses wait, think science supports it. parent taught yet. like manners. Every kind learn them, need taught practice. instant. anything worse WFH Tech consultants telling small business owners stop selfish? Truly bottom barrel people. Yes, restriction Brazil (and others) going lapse January. executive order extended it. Got test morning. one original ones tickle brain nose. Uncomfortable sure painful expected know HIT clot not.

And was, that's actually good news. believe Israel sort leveled prior cases dropping. May close point easy write negative headlines find bad outcomes, whole bunch younger kids worked pretty well. 

I've spent time kids (who 12) year would otherwise spent *their entire childhoods*. We've done things otherwise done, time focus learning stuff outside normal school lessons, worked specific challenges.

It's going take time adjust back group settings, confidently say we're better would never happened.

Before anybody starts, realize universal experience, also hardly isolated one. North America, South America Africa fair game. 
  
I think mostly get Canadians anyways. Ok bad reading fast. Still though, I’m wondering. point getting tested cold symptoms. Wouldn’t make sense treat like virus go doctor symptoms get unbearable?  test do? know it’s dumb advice I’m avoiding things could prevent honestly would go random US state enjoy freedom you’re comfortable so. learned. hard all. Well first already approved Covid vaccine congrats 5 people morons don’t research second, monitoring properly. Third, it’s virus .01 percent chance killing worlds greatest athletes. sure would difficult find even one person died competing professionally today. Also limiting amount spectators following protocols. Japan completely capable throwing event. personally like data page Washington Post, require Yeah, definitely getting Covid vaccine daughter, assuming there's known side effects. never reaction vaccines before, good shape food allergies (remaining ones nut based). Yes! sadly even miss waiting line. make lot friends way. hated waiting 1.5 hour line get Lollapalooza 2019, would take past year, day. send story religious guy stays home flood... asks God help repeatedly sent numerous people boats rescue finally dies confronts God he's told rescuers help asking for. Yeah bunch subscriptions share here, I’m interested subscription one article. think likely give shot perform test time. Then, test positive, get sent set doses non-heparin blood thinner last next weeks.

Still one shot, provided test done either flow/stick tests kind quick finger prick test. get ticket drive without seatbelt police officer sees you.

Michigan saw higher raw number young adult admits despite hospitalizations overall nearly marching November peak. particular, B.1.1.7 variant generate higher viral load, studies show higher virulence (more severe outcomes), B.1.135 P.1 somewhat better escaping immune system

Vaccines working push burden illness younger, variants appear making infections younger adults severe average 3-6 months ago Ron Howard voiceover: ""They couldn't"" tho Agreed.. agree targeted. things like gyms restaurants whatnot, social spread still enormous. guess simple test take, can't take case get peace mind symptoms? die two less idiots listen to.  can’t argue doomsday crowd. world ending we’re gonna die unless stay bubbles next 150 years.

Kids immune Covid studies showing risk causing ADEM children. 10 year old onset’s ADEM maybe get lucky needs minor restorative therapy skills lost. Along increased risk MS onset get older. 2 year old get ADEM looking high risk lifetime developmental disabilities like boy has. Dude I'm India even thought leaving home go anywhere scares death. thinking going dentist tomorrow morning. Fever got control within 24hrs onset, guess great reaction. ulcers fucking painful. I'm aware blood clotting evens Pfizer Moderna. Sure, still would nice get everyone vaccinated asap. Thank information. know medications transplant patients take would prevent immune system responding vaccines robust way. See doctor, that's typical. well Roaring 20's started early age bracket. can't really blame them. They're demo least affected medically pandemic. Hopefully they'll realize sooner tamp cases sooner economy &amp; job prospects &amp; career advancement take hold. Pfizer Moderna products fundamentally different. Bayer required help? Merck? one man trial blood clots. Plunge comes negative word title... Except among anti vax seniors. continue get sick die. Report sides China India first. Taiwan individual battle divide China's front. Russia knocking Gobi, China realize spreading armies cover every inch crossable border difficult. 

Phillipines, India, Taiwan, rest SEA + USA vs China.  I'm kind similar get symptoms much. started another illness affected immune system. I've always wondered whether still sick asymptomatic comes colds (I would get unexplained fatigue around time partner would full-blown cold). literally went like 7 years without single cold flu something, sick dog something else entire time Literally done:

1. Bring J&amp;J back market people want one-dose solution want use mRNA.

2. Openly promote fact vaccinated people spread COVID need follow guidelines.

Once vaccines stagnate, easy way get shots arms say, ""Hey, go Walgreens, get single shot, wear mask two weeks.""

Instead we're wasting time telling people give two shits catching spreading COVID need get vaccinated keep following guidelines. need ""expert"" realize messaging going result vaccinations prematurely stalling. course we’ve tried. thing!! Go Reds!!! May 12th here! feels like light end tunnel. 😭 think lot survivorship bias, inability people deny something exists until/unless happens personally.   People young 45, least book. send US supply JJ Michigan young men. Zero men serious reactions. Divert vaccines women. “THE WAY STOP WEARING MASKS END PANDEMIC VACCINES” seems forced Decent parenting, leading example. agree that's there's probably bunch people turned drinking pandemic. see there's also quite people, like myself, drink socially cut considerably? stretch assume people turning clubs parties probably demographic. 

You're going see lot people think party like used to. going sloppy. Lots doctors around US actually saying stop giving 2nd doses get 1st doses every ASAP. They're saying part believe immunity last longer 4 week interval chosen clinical trials. According (which actually relatively pessimistic source), United States track herd immunity July 3, 2021. end horrid plague nascent American people, wear masks socially distance little longer! You’re welcome. Yeah, correct. probably take advice talk Germany threads Germany, bring US topics US.

I guess I've spending little much time reddit enjoyed trash talking US gotten past year, particularly people countries Europe grounds really criticize anyone else.

I definitely accept US royally messed up. I'm happy situation Texas. Realistically, I'm sure government could made outcome better, people going going restrictions would caused outrage unrest. I'm biased since I'm young(ish) healthy fortunately lose anyone close COVID. realize everyone fortunate anyway.

Anyway, perhaps need take break reddit causing hypocritical petty..lol.

Getting second dose hour, hope rest day good! Mask no? lol yeah- 100 years spanish flu were....uh, great lol

can even fucking imagine ? Germany wanted EU order vaccines though? Closing provincial borders means get see girlfriend whole summer either :') biggest deal grand scheme things love “I’m waxed vaxxed ready PARTY”! -imlooloo 2021 question hard understand. gets tested covid ideally would mean she’d quarantine period time, let people she’s close contact know alerted. missing here? You’re basically asking test. Oh boy. Buddy, get tinfoil hat pay attention reality. even covered CNN Christ sakes. Media manipulation old tactic going decades. Thinking otherwise pure insanity. maybe mean natural selection? Rather evolution? Well places higher overall past estimates covid cases immunity. states bit farther south warmer less exposed lakes cool temperatures.

Also like point spikes happen surprising ways, seen taking actions combat decrease cases. fact can't fully explain mean things partially explain it. still understand this? year? Irresponsible too. Well either die learn die build immune response it. One way another move on. Sadly others giving others choice. Even did, would still follow restrictions. Stores closed, probably lose summer job (I'm university student living province currently). sucks. drowning someone offers life vest refuse, well... bad  ""Edwin Michael, University South Florida epidemiologist, said COVID vaccine done job protecting seniors won’t continue unless young people get shots.

“COVID Florida always spread young people,” said. “Vaccinating seniors made difference safeguarding hospitals saving people death it’s going end pandemic.” One get vaccine. Sadly wound ventilator. Covid going become endemic antivaxxers. least next year so. eventually unvaccinated, say 1% got vaccinated also got covid, mostly unvaccinated gonna wind sick, hospitalized, die. I'm antivaxxers. gripe actions leads virus evading vaccines available. keep hospital cold anything else cause I'm vaccinated, oh well. problem anymore. Reminder saying “you’re idiot don’t get vaccinated” “get vaccinated protect serious injury death there’s still risk don’t want transmit it” might [not fully] correct counterproductive asking people hesitant get vaccinated. failed asking people wear masks, specifically first phrase. want someone get vaccinated tell risk proven low, protects transmission along catching severe case it, isn’t much hassle get done it’s quick. made really mad last year people getting really mad people wearing masks saying stuff made people don’t like masks angrier less willing wear one. Didn’t listen what? say, Christ solutions. Many love live CHAOS. Right now, country still time daily highs vaccinations, concerned eventually reach herd immunity, especially add children mix.

With said, short term, need better job balancing vaccines states (more vaccines high vaccination states like New Jersey Massachusetts, fewer Idaho Alabama) within states (more vaccines Chicago, Atlanta, LA, NY, fewer rural parts states).

I agree point going run people want vaccine proactive looking it, going need get vaccines arms a) people open vaccine, proactive trying get b) portion vaccine hesitant (you going convince all, convince 25-40% them, make big difference Missoula's college town, wonder shots distributed students campus health center? issue? far haven’t vaccine widely available young people. We’ll see rate actually get vaccinated. Anecdotally I’ve seen lot younger people jump chance get vaccinated. 

Sometimes it’s inconvenient “for greater good”, free society people get chose things like getting vaccinated. think like vaccines, people get it. US almost half population least 1 shot btw. 

Hopefully evidence vaccine especially loosening restrictions encourage people fence take leap get vaccinated. It’s obviously nice anyone piece mind immune COVID. Like Jason Tatum January still requires inhaler happens clear plan reopening vaccination goals. Easing restrictions tied vaccination numbers; supply demand vaccinate enough people make case numbers go stay down, politicians impatient.  opinions old.  real. starting feel like spikes random unavoidable, honestly. That’s thing love moonshot projects. succeed it’s god damn fucking accomplishment. fail still probably achieved one hell lot good. let’s put much behind effort possible see happens.  Yeah died survived. don’t think so. can’t get it. could chose too, would be. like spring break Florida.. hey totally agree God water temples going nowhere. need saty putt indoors Fun story: kids started trading masks school cooler ones. That's really works know know clots vaccine related. worth, [Russian researchers developed Sputnik say nothing adenovirus vector, instead caused inadequate purification methods. Natural selection thing. public health theatre finest, people actually care stopping COVID. 

We know social distancing vital COVID mitigation *but* types social distancing much efficient others. Everyone loves praise lockdowns, lockdown forces people go work crowded, poorly ventilated spaces punishing socializing reasonably (small gatherings) work! gathering restrictions necessary form stopping people big parties, send people work crowded environments put amount risk, more. thing happened UK Ireland lockdowns, shameful. can't bothered seek facts, mean exist. could totally wrong this, think clots observed 7-14 days post shot. extrapolate worldwide Covid’s death toll probably around 5 million world population 7.5 billion whereas Spanish Flu’s somewhere 17-50million world population 2 billion. You’re right don’t know people arguing you. like shot girl summer 💉 see. remember seeing news bunch snowbirds getting it. guess spend months often place Florida spend winters Florida, summer Canada. seem rise slower before. would see worrying spike cases that’s case right it’s like gradual rise don’t get even “just flu” you’re still supposed get vaccinated flu! We’re talking someone’s mom Dude I’m boat. would probably hospitalized first. Every ER doctor US, EU, UK lookout particular symptoms, I'd imagine terribly hard diagnose treat given adults California eligible, that's 52% adult Californians? know unpopular, pretty sure right this. 

It needs symbolic - start charging adults vaccine like September. gotten November, pay extra health insurance something else like vehicle registration something like that. aspects treating Covid longer covered insurance unvaccinated certain date. Like pillows something small. 

And clear, I'm talking fees/etc less like $20. Symbolic. Dont hasty.

But yes dying's best part living. called almost-live-dying. Legit question....what people covid? you’re immune compromised covid isn’t thing trying avoid   Use vaccinespotter.org website. Looking Miami 20 places.  quite undocumented immigrants Florida, doubt really need SS number. website makes fill one put 0s. numbers article low they’re basically meaningless. hand free birth control government clinics there. Here’s advice: don’t come Reddit advice. It’s probably worst place possible. Especially sub overrun anti mask loons. Go experts advice. experts say: no, it’s safe yet dine indoors- even vaccinated. reference 60% Biden county. beginning end. million Pfizer distributed

111 million Moderna.

17 million J&amp;J

&amp;#x200B;

where live, anyone ***thought*** getting J&amp;J settle one others instead.

&amp;#x200B;

the pause really big deal availability.. ""convenience"" problem. think precisely CDC FDA already well aware conditions AZ causing J&amp;J used similar technology, able act much quickly first cases emerged.

Though compare German, Norwegian, etc. authorities, also acted quickly pause AZ detected cases (and vilified global press it...) mean regards normal life resuming, Canada could vaccinate 80% population would still subject restrictions place right people condition higher chance get rare blood clots getting AZ? anything known it? companies better things put money towards breaking point every company higher roi vaccine research.

If America really ""we're together"", lot viruses things would much research put point.  20% extremely healthy 20 year olds get reinfected short time span (6 months less)? 

You think good news? Good deal. It’s load off. listen...the definition insanity point days... lesson others. Adaptable doesn’t mean free damage. It’s still serious reaction stated since OP said zero men serious reactions. Go 2nd Wednesday. That’s unlikely, virus would unrealistically severe mutation happen Man can’t wait finally feel like there’s choice risk tolerance stuff involved lot stuff. Yes, probably Brazil's India's numbers vastly undercounted compared richer countries. happens seniors fall vaccine hesitancy prevents us reaching actual herd immunity? Don’t believe everything read. San Francisco already there, though I'm fine waiting every adult opportunity get vaccinated going long time. public health experts demand indefinite mask mandates past point neuroses, I'd consider overreach. mRNA vaccines given hundreds millions people. prevalent what’s happening AZ J&amp;J, would’ve hundreds people aged 20-50 drop dead across world apparent reason. There’s way thing would missed, J&amp;J AZ weren’t missed much smaller sample sizes. concern trolling unnecessary. I'm less hopeful unfortunately, live Michigan. county 32% fully vaccinated. we've breaking records. Indoor dining issue  Maybe need working parenting. sounds like kid charge instead you. grandmother uncle live small city (less mil) Vladimir Oblast. denied vaccine month feeling like it. mother managed persuade get vaccine easy getting vaccination centre get shot. vaccination spot empty told us.

So no, mostly people want get vaccine, shortages (I understand somewhere find localized shortages major vaccination problem)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: uncle, ;) highly concerning. Children seen lowest risk group symptomatic cases even pneumonia incredibly rare.

I think need look double-mutation strain come India closely. could variant serious concern. Hmm... Would possible test fast? think immune system would enough time response make antibodies. Maybe ask observe possible symtoms.

A fast test would great, though. Basically. Altho first dose handwritten in, second dose printed sticker placed first dose info hastily. see second dose. bro went, nurse forgot even mark second
dose card, handed back empty slot notice. I'm sure there's record somewhere never asked SSNs ID mass drive thru clinics went to. Smart. It’s here. Every. mean every.

If anti-maskers basic thing, would saved lot lives, money, freedom. Everybody hoe up!! Lol ""Symptomatic cases among vaccinated 37% lower risk hospitalization unvaccinated cases"" mean ""37% efficacy hospitalization UK"". Like all.

Honestly seemed like young people US never stopped partying first place. endorse lol NEW DELHI (Reuters) - second surge COVID-19 cases India swamped hospitals much faster first mutations virus mean patient infecting many people before, epidemiologists doctors say.

India's daily infections skyrocketed 20-fold 200,000 Thursday since multi-month-low early February, though government played role mutants latest rise, worst anywhere month.

The world's hardest-hit country United States reported 950 cases people contracting variants first detected United Kingdom, South Africa Brazil.

""The point variants concern still top discourse,"" said epidemiologist Rajib Dasgupta New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.

""Even new variant, need things"" control treat patients ""but requires different urgency recognise that"", said.

Doctors New Delhi's India Institute Medical Sciences found one patient infecting nine 10 contacts, compared four last year.

Scientists Britain say B.1.1.7 version virus, widely known UK variant, 70% transmissible previous versions, potentially deadlier.

The northern Indian state Punjab, reported one highest recent fatality rates country, said late last month 81% 401 COVID-19 samples sent genome sequencing found UK variant.

""This virus infectious virulent,"" said Dhiren Gupta, senior consultant New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

""More children reporting high-grade fever compared last year. 35-year olds pneumonia intensive care, happening last year.""

India recorded 14.1 million infections 173,123 deaths total.

MASS GATHERINGS

The government mainly attributed big rise cases reluctance wear marks crowding.

Still, refused call mass gathering Hindu devotees festival ministers addressing tens thousands largely mask-less people election rallies.

A scientist National Institute Epidemiology said evidence needed directly link rise cases variants, anecdotally seemed case.

""There in-vitro experiments also tell us infectivity, severity, lethal is, etc, completed yet, ongoing,"" said Tarun Bhatnagar.

""We virus spread rapidly, time study it. Everything go. dealing it, affected studying it. pace every thing fast.""

But crowding still common many regions India, ""we find dangerous strain is"", said Om Srivastava, head infectious diseases Mumbai's Jaslok Hospital also advises India's worst-hit Maharashtra state. acknowledged writing conspiracy theory comment. describing community distinctive difference communities. also hear term ""white americans"" lot, Americans white. know? person administered vaccine told Advil Tylenol okay take. mean, vaxxed yes, bush thing. explains ""Jesus take wheel"" moments.

Homie looks like jogging sunglasses ear phones happened jog drive covid station NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Gasping air, two men wearing oxygen masks share bed government hospital India's capital New Delhi, victims country's growing COVID-19 crisis.

From reporting 10,000 new daily cases earlier year, daily infections crossed 200,000 Thursday, according official data, highest anywhere world.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP), one India's largest COVID-only facilities 1,500 beds, stream ambulances ferried patients overflowing casualty ward Thursday.

Some also arrived buses three-wheeled autorickshaws.

The youngest patient new-born baby.

""We definitely over-burdened. already working full capacity,"" said hospital's medical director, Suresh Kumar.

From initial 54 beds, hospital 300 COVID-19 patients critical condition. Even enough.

Unrelated patients share beds, bodies recently deceased lie outside ward taken mortuary.

""Today 158 admissions Lok Nayak alone,"" Kumar said. Almost severe cases.

After imposing one world's strictest lockdowns nearly three months last year, India's government relaxed almost curbs beginning 2021, although many regions introduced localised restrictions.

LNJP's Kumar said fast-spreading new variants evade testing adding burden, human behaviour country reopened.

""People following COVID guidelines,"" said. ""They careless.""

Outside hospital's mortuary, weeping relatives gathered hot sun wait bodies loved ones released vax available everyone, that's enough lockdowns mask mandates. Seems like guys ok life forever virus still killing people Maybe burrito, obviously. they’ve vaxxed waxed That’s horrible idea Yes, accused cherry picking data, updated study. 2 days later.

I'm never going wish anyone ill will, even they're negatively impact them. available vaccines Canada? certain regions country unused vaccine doses sitting around people living want get vaccine demand tapering maybe start donating unused doses countries would actually use it. World War III: *Everybody* dies

Coming world soon And? plenty Americans. Biden said he’s sharing surplus doses *when available*. Jesus feel like I’m reading choosing beggars comments lately. Got second Pfizer yesterday sore arm.

Today woke started feeling strange within hours aches, lower back pain, fever, chills. Definitely hitting like truck.

I know normal wife made take Tylenol. reduce efficacy vaccine take immune response?

Can't seem get straight answer internet rise level bugging doctor weekend. curious, thanks! Indeed, everyone.  Perhaps even *Everybody* needs take vaccine. Young, old, high risk low risk.

Low risk people take mostly protect others.

High risk people take protect *also* protect others. 

More enough high risk people able spread disease many, many others. getting vaccinated also means protecting others. Hypothetically say US get war China weakens point Germany Japan end WW2, would surrender nuke everything? Weird thought weren’t following regulations recommend COVID There’re also many poorer countries facing fourth wave urgent need vaccines. Canada entitled vaccines. Exactly capitalism means make way life hard way yes least factor ""Herd Immunity"" Yeah, really sucks Canada right now. :( Madness. Engaging drug alcohol fuelled orgies midst global pandemic truly dystopian. explosion hospitalizations could change things, vaccines plateauing curve gives hospitalizations biggest concern.

Hmmm 46.4% individuals currently incarcerated federal prisons drug  I'm proud wife part this. RN traveling senior care facilities giving vaccine. says terrifying number senior citizens heard covid Oh finally!! 8% isn’t bad all, since restrictions pretty much stopped everywhere. advocating neverending lockdowns. level risk even acceptable you? going federal prison dimebag. fucking, too, right? huge bible thumper aunt said thing.

Her teenage daughter replied family's group chat, ""didn't take advil morning? natural forms medicines not?"" risk/reward got 2nd Moderna dose yesterday too, cheers! Sorry hear it’s kicking butt. feel pretty good actually...just body aches. Kinda like walked around amusement park yesterday helped someone move. Hope tomorrow treating better! sure can. Suck up. Michigan Ontario explosion? Weren’t studying thing even safe? conclude studies? True! specified mainstream. glad hear neighbors north getting vaccines need! ready meet buds. Pretty much this. Unfortunately it’s easier blame woman top.
If anyone fucked up, it’s federal states, federal government. yep, exactly. worldometers.info think different, think careful comes kids. articles explains hard compare vaccines better can, try.

Essentially, phase 3 clinical trial targets changed - Moderna &amp; Pfizer testing symptomatic COVID infection, J&amp;J testing prevention severe COVID illness. It’s hard say Moderna &amp; Pfizer vaccines would reputation followed testing J&amp;J. &amp; still isn’t much testing know sure effective Moderna &amp; Pfizer variants compared J&amp;J vaccine. 

It really incredible watch science happen real time, &amp; frustrating see media really perpetuated reputation certain vaccines. They’re great choices, &amp; forced say, would probably agree Pfizer &amp; Moderna effective J&amp;J, honestly it’s probably minimal difference. vitamin D? giving free vitamin supplements everyone. health care workers health levels ages. anything worse general public due exposure.

I suppose Yahweh snapped fingers removed virus people vaccine people. still ignoring Oxford study. Kinda sounds like making broad generalization media misleading title ive ever read paywall kicks really want expand global vaccine access super easy. Open Pfizer patents allow manufacturing powerhouses like China India pump out. severely immunosuppressed individual? MMR vaccines protective effects covid seven years shot school age kids get it. Meanwhile state, Michigan... Yeah transplant recipients many immunosuppressants basically adaptive immune system. Almost way vaccine could even work (if they're still highest doses meds.) It’s possible new variants affecting children much original virus. stated news couple weeks ago. Thank hell? 
Why would vaccine shot? 
What vaccine do? hopefully socially accepted personal choice wear them. there's really significant percentage people live isolated like describing. vast majority rural Americans live towns range population hundred several thousand bigger thing viral vector combination low platelets making treatment heparin bad idea CVST. 0 occurrences combo mRNA vaccines. I'd say no. reaction dull headache lasted days. 2 weeks seems excessive.  Congratulations Chancellor Merkel auspicious occasion.

Especially prisons areas lot vaccines takers. Yes, know put HIV vaccine easily capture empty land 20 years later! Seriously, propaganda Russia western media? people EE choose various reasons. choice, half population would take vaccine. nailed every point. 32 million cases US. like virus going away... Vaccine take rate going might well get best vaccine folks smart enough take it.

I'm way past worrying luddites. care thing mutate something far deadly fix luddite problem us vaccine glut sets in. got J&amp;J dose 3 days paused would gotten vaccine that's offered knew risks wanted protected protect others literally home 15 months continued part everyday. 5 trips. 2 robocalls one real call. one ever showed up. Total farce. Kids can't go school, can't go outside. lunacy. science advisors health ""experts"".

Lockdown created death, anxiety, loss good years. Old people depressed fuck people living last years alone.

They could put effort vaccinating vulnerable keeping society open. We'd done bullshit long time. Reports started coming people catching new strains suffering serious disease still.
You get flu one year still get serious case new flu next. 
While Covid-19 flu family would suggest infection/reinfection pattern.
All come time people getting virus. Yeah sure experience. built oyster farms worked day care managing projects. made case get ten 3-year-olds cooperate clean toys, wash hands, get ready trip park everything need, get environmental consultants, engineers, ,First Nations, local government come together table set project plan. rate closing border us sooner. Let's say covid death rate 1% (I know probably not, need easy number) vaccine prevents 80% deaths, mean takes covid mortality 0.2%?

My dad got vaccine Wednesday mom hopefully got today. northeast US least, Asian folks wearing masks subway flu season years.

Yeah, mixing levels here. doubt intentional, helpful make generalizations like support contradiction specific Free vaccines new thing people US.

These words could technically true *10%* people USA free flu shot last year, 20% knew partake, 70% eligible know it.

So... pretty useless statement.

Do numbers? give them.

I'd say takes 20% Americans *not know* covid vaccine available free them, vague ""are new thing to..."" phrase bad incorrect. even less 20%, still helpful statement.

 old 12 ? Yeah. get it. also understand saying person quarantine person would headache enforce keep with. 

Same way masks. Everyone wear mask vaccinated already COVID. Well Joe sees people wearing mask gonna wanna wear mask even meet requirements. 

Such fine line. keep poking people vaccine hopefully couple months way better spot. That's best part ;)

/s swear God 500,000 deaths well. would get AstraZeneca? vaccines haven’t killed people? suggestions derived directly strategies used facilities intended house people contagious diseases. may paranoid people living single family homes small building ventilation good. us large urban MDUs units connected interior hallway, quite common new construction hot south.. Perhaps paranoid.

One take precautions appropriate situation. look cases then. Vietnam 3,000. Taiwan same. US has...I can’t even remember many MILLIONS. Yeah I'm wearing mask outside like it, stay home jump way pass. wear mask home? Better safe! Japanese actually tradition wearing masks pre-covid. Japanese gentleman tell comes allergies people Japan tend prone hay fever (No idea true mind you) also due high population density many Japanese cities people wear flu season. 

For myself. ready done them. think however mental wall get first time go grocery shopping without mask. Yes issss Pfizer ganggggg at! hope 100% effective Iam glad others also think so. course would happy get vaccination soon, remember Bergamo last winter/spring wanna first see older people around Europe (as share thr shots with, ofc everywhere like this) getting theirs. ""Study marine recruits finds covid grants 80% immunity""

This headline generalizing extremely particular result. guarantee actual immunity figure way different one found cohabiting barrack soldiers. generalizing 80% figure? 80% whom? literally can't tell. Shitty headline bro.

You come single accurate headline original. found 10% followed reinfected asymptomatic.

So title little misleading. chance symptomatic reinfection low. heard novavax while. Must've scam Preach comrade! wish US followed playbook way Taiwan followed theirs. Based flu numbers, I'd totally fine wearing masks couple weeks early January on. Maybe limited capacity though. grocery stores public transportation office, idk i'm spitballin assholes block exports Truthfully didn’t consider — good shout. Yes! Pretty cool huh? Vaccine tourism must appealing majority world doesn’t access vaccines. Yeah, absolutely sucks Philly poorly, upside sign there's definitely still room growth 65+ percentage. way around thing happened me, thinking ""are \*sure\* gave shot?"" sure felt morning after! Definitely case live. Masks everywhere around here.

Of course going vary region, even reddest states never bothered enforce mitigation efforts, individuals actually care wearing masks. think possible people continue they're concerned things like flu. there's comments much EU exports etc.

Being selectively uninformed biggest EU export I'm aware of. comment made smile. lot. 

Party down, quiltin’ mama! conservative vaccinated, trying get friends family get vaccinated, really hard, successful changing one person's mind... pooled test 15 April came back positive COVID-19, individual swab done 16 April also positive COVID-19 infection. conveyed ambulance National Centre Infectious Diseases (NCID), developed fever test conducted National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) 16 April negative COVID-19 infection subsequent test 17 April NPHL positive COVID-19. serological test result come back positive, indicative past infection. could shedding minute fragments virus RNA past infection, given able definitively conclude infected, take necessary public health actions precautionary measure. test result came back positive COVID-19 infection 16 April conveyed NCID ambulance. serology test result household contacts Case 61536, Work Pass holder arrived India 2 April. tested positive COVID-19 infection 2 April subsequently assessed recovered case based positive serology result 4 April.



Huh. Interesting. It’s free everyone US. anecdote severe case different someone says ""well, it, must exist!"" consider specific situation might exceptional. know fall ""young people"" bracket not, regardless, would like direct data linked comment see think it. believe headline, that’s I’m kind afraid of. James Bradley, 21, however, much party person feel like I'm missing something, exactly know I'm missing,"" says.

Prior pandemic, well generation kids large amount smoking, drugs, drinking, compared past generations. largely, believe, set bad example youths almost seem know weren’t ones lead example. Obviously still exists, lower numbers past generations.

But now, we’ve got kids who’ve indoors year feeling like they’re missing best time lives. Worried that’s going end lot them. Wow Canadians losing Roaring 20’s... followed Great Depression. history repeating itself, don’t forget bad parts. They’re avoidable actually pay attention. feel like, people, taking trip Alaska get vaccinated rational choice. costs associated probably hurt covid would, people able get home countries months June 1 anyway. Also certain types Canadian family  exactly did.

They producing millions doses vaccines still tested. millions ready day one.

The big problem mathematical- Billions people planet. Lucky you, it’s free US Canada devils advocate here.... country without vaccine production really well. Huge ramp ups progress entire country first doses June, done August things continue. 

Australia hand yeash.

But yes need get domestic vaccines strong... First dose last Tuesday. Sore arm Wednesday, nothing more. Yeah no, doesn't. go texas.  Lmao where’d get last part from? county vaccines available anyone 16+ 3 weeks now. Currently, 29% population least one dose. site got mine many unfilled appointments , taking walk-ins now. look good, least fully protected couple weeks. What's going Israel... mean like knew vaccines worked, able go 8,624 average daily cases January 180 average daily cases 59% first dose. great news, shows vaccines certainly help prevent spread covid. mean hell, lowest case number(34) since May 2020... Getting 2nd dose week. 

Anybody know it’s possible get subscription Plan B? good  It’s free everyone US. Clinically, even fever, see anything concerned about. First all, comparison COVID STIs ignorant offensive. narrow view people hold sort social stigma towards STIs antiquated biased. 


We've already. introduction PREP large segment people ditched condoms returned preferred form activity, even risk STIs. stigma getting something like Gonorrhea dissipated among younger generations, prevailing consensus people right decide risk aversion strategies. 


For COVID, really think sort social stigma regarding people decided reclaim lives? Maybe echo chamber message boards (but doubtful considering much downvoted). reality negative stigma towards people think restrictions continue forever, need completely change lives. 

You said yourself, bars restaurants packed. People about. understand virus spread made decision anyways. People making risk aversion assessments consciously deciding would rather take risk rejoin world. 


That going change, matter much try shame people. I’m aware 60 percent county’s residents get least one dose May 11, public health officials change mask mandate recommendation. COVID numbers worsen, county reinstate mandate Israel this. Quite effectively. see much better outcomes US Europe terms rates.

Their quarantine contact tracing effectively enforced opinion. Lovely. start exporting vaccines. idea testing going India? reliable indicator new cases? drank hella water Gatorade ate weight grams protein night before. didn’t feel hangover, achey muscles/joints felt tired. took one dose (200 mg believe), take two. Taking two would probably make feel better, faster. Alaska 2.29 million visitors 2019. Bryce Canyon Rainier 2 million each. One giant ass state that's super remote vs. national parks fairly easily accessible like, 1/1000th size (guessing).

I'd say that's lot tourists simply based location feasibility/cost get there. massive 3rd wave

No, think precise purpose public health policy protect people adverse outcomes. don’t allow people choose drive without seatbelts certainly don’t allow make choice drive without functioning brakes. don’t even let people go public without clothing, despite public health rational. case requiring masks unvaccinated people much stronger case public nudity. second response saying even word it. Also really depends where/how it.

Thanks info. lung function tests done treatment, none really show changes apparently (and thankfully, skin definitely heal quickly since -- wounds still close fast, still see marks weeks/months instead days).

My radiology finding mediastinal scar tissue calcification primary tumor, ever doctor freaks new x-ray explain compare them. That's cool. would refuse? bad thing duplicate efforts. Heck, Pfizer Moderna might pick something regulators miss (and vice-versa). go find hubby! Lol no. family (immediate extended) back partying like normal since May 2020. Usually one asked people tone (like insisted sister host birthday.party fall cases rising). How’s everyone doing? 11 days I’m well 👍🏽 People don’t upset situation want.

That doesn’t change reality people behave. Angrily screaming young adults isn’t pragmatic way handle situation. still lived bay area absolutely would signed kids it. pfizer vaccine. doesnt blood clot risk already myself. also desperately want kids school fucked socially sad. question is: vaccinated able virus contagiate others, PCR test?

I indeed think vaccination would allow PCRs using masks taking social distancing.

Maybe going far precaution side, vaccines (which ones) protect new variants UK, Brazil, SA?

I would realistic cautious regarding expectations vaccination short term, mean 2021... promised type ""normality"" like showed UK (we vaccinated, lets go pub...) risking create lot frustration people. fine.

That kind ""insulated bubble thinking"" problem though. (I've seen many many many times past year).

If group people.. nobody group knows anyone else caught Covid (or died it).. becomes mentality ""that's (somewhere else) exist (or ""doesn't effect us""). 

People act like they're somehow ""superhuman"". they're not. 

March-April last year spent 38 days Hospital (16 days ICU Ventilator). many months oxygen-tank, physical rehab. relearning walk, etc. 

I tell story every chance get.. invariably run someone (2 3 times week) say:. ""Oh wow. .you're 1st person I've met it"" (or variation that). 

People need shaken ""this exist"" (or ""this can't effect me"") bubble. anyone else give households ton reassurance won’t attending Covid parties vaccinated?

I keep reassuring family still plan mask still plan avoid large gatherings, even vaccine, till public health guidance changes. Also, “you can’t expect young give lives” extremely ignorant statement considering millions people worldwide short periods able go back relatively normal quite quickly due diligence. I’m way! Even downloaded Grindr day till realized I’m looking husband headless torso pic. Damn sucks. experiences mild? hear 2nd time reason worse first, unexpected. masking avoiding social gatherings? That’s selfish.

How fuck selfish? AZ vaccine 100% effective death, that's lie. Jury still J&amp;J Canadian living 1 hour border, would gladly drive hour, pay pocket vaccine, drive home follow 14 day self-isolation leaving country. repeat month later (or whenever next dose scheduled). would myself, also many people allowed this, would help canada get back normal sooner. I’ve saying summer - kicking Memorial Day weekend - going one big national party 

Whole lot pent energy, appreciation didn’t couldn’t last year+ burn 

(It’s probably going rough work leisure/entertainment industries, won’t staffing place handle influx, try little understanding inevitably wait line)  false. AstraZeneca used Germany Denmark know nothing VITT frequency J&amp;J. technology two vaccines similar, different spike protein carried different viral vector, vaccine made different non-active ingredients. Chance risk different two vaccines large. fantastic news. fight always hospitalizations death, case counts. step right direction. sleep left side 3 days. 4th day still sore laying side enough keep sleeping. finally gone. 

One thing noticed went without moving left arm would get stiff hurt tried move it, tried keep moving often really flex out, even though hurt so. would worse.

That's experience. can’t expect young people care anyone else, including future selves.

Kids get mmr around 1 booster around kindergarten.  site vaccination figures county even state level?

Honestly, sub place i've seen delivers rational information. Every link seems indicating we'll never see herd immunity due people refusing vaccine ideological reasons.

200 million almost 2/3rds US population. So, can't many people refusing vaccine based ""muh freedom!""

I hate seem falling sensationalist headlines. According virologist Idaho, Dr Ryan Cole: 

“The virus fragile activated sunlight ventilation. Masking outdoors insanity

There thing “cold flu season “it low vitamin season. prohormone true vitamin; master key immune health; vitamin level mid range cannot get Covid. Vitamin print prevents cytokine storm that’s caused severe Covid kills people

70% world immune suppressed due low vitamin D; 85% African-Americans, 70% Latinos 72% native Americans low vitamin D

Above 35th parallel people cannot synthesize vitamin skin 4-5 months year. Obesity diminishes bioavailability vitamin D, gets absorbed body fat, rather blood stream 
work.” 

I think may explain disparity northern tier states southern states. Look YouTube. Would interested clinicians sub think. one. Per CDC don’t need quarantine exposed someone positive. want watch symptoms it’s highly unlikely vaccinated person catch it, minor. really understand frustrations. really think, given example above, frustrated Duke's measures anything else, they're overreaction. Take look numbers cancer deaths young people pg. 29 [this compare number covid deaths age brackets [the CDC's think might find surprised. name state? friend got covid, fever past 12 - 14 days (between 98 100). O2 levels normal. Took azythromycin 5 days paracetamol fever.

Is fever prolonged time alright? really didn’t think masks Are/were necessary that’s 80 years stock pile emergency supply thing stockpiled nuclear warheads, crazy expensive jets, guns bullets. sure that? close Canadian relatives MN border western ON. could get vaccine 10 mins drive house Minnesota, questions asked. county across border one vaccinated places world (like already).

They're complaining border closed, last year mocking incessantly Canada want border open. Canadians actually cross land borders US right now? IMO clearly damages lockdown. plenty doctors/scientists saying get silenced banned platforms agree mainstream 'experts'.

Soon majority people realize what's going on. Lockdown even stop spread, look numbers. thing allows citizens cheering literally go police state.

Not trying dramatic crazy, years ago type thing wars fought over. J&amp;j took almost 3 billion.... texas. India cases country one sixth population.

India deaths per million population: 127

Brazil deaths per million population: 1726 Well, is. vaccine costs $3 $30 depending technology. AZ $3, J&amp;J $30. world afford $3-30 per person per year worldwide, afford it. $21-210 billion per year entire world. total world economy worth 80,270 billion per year. means cost vaccination would ~0.1% ~0.01% world economy. 

Cheap, there. destination - tourists pay per head get there.  pay eat sleep.  plane lots masks passing through.  profitable?

Chile plunge among hospitalizations.... new strains, probably brazilian ones, sending 30 year olds hospital.... Basically young unvaccinated people 20 50. surprise. article much measured headline. I’m starting think headline writers need fired. number Florida seniors entering hospital COVID dropped sharply past month, indication vaccination campaign begun December effective protecting group vulnerable registered 46% drop admissions COVID patients aged 70 since mid-February, encouraging sign fight pandemic. since COVID deaths typically preceded hospitalizations, drop indication death rate may continue signs remain. hospitalization rate younger people begun creeping upward, paralleling drop age average person COVID.

I believe conundrum. Cries Canadian Time get married! capture cases deaths accurately.

india probably ability... may want actual numbers disseminated.

I know sounds but, yeah... I’m getting archive link. I’m mobile. Thanks. :) prevent catching Covid-19.

The terrible messaging around vaccines makes weep.

STILL somehow repeated. I’m sorry. Please remember isn’t fault chose take risk herself. Anywhere car take 7 minutes $80, walk. say 2-3 months since widely available, 5800 66 million got COVID. I'm twisting conclusion. backed data countries; look numbers Israel. Since vaccinated country world capita (I saw 86% 16+ population either vaccinated COVID), really useful case study well vaccines work. case counts dropped 98% since January. point depends define ""debate"" lol VaCcInE iSnT aPpRoVeD!!!!!!

One best decisions I’ve made, hands down. Think expensive would get COVID. Reschedule get shot. worth it. follow traffic laws?.. wear seatbelt?... wash hands going bathroom?.. throw trash trash can?...

You things “for peoples health”. ""How do, fellow young people?"" Ok. again, I’ll use line “look science”! say rather 0% chance dying, that’s possible, die. terms actually contracting virus, yeah sucks, however, getting sick nothing new human biology, chances dying COVID low though, point probably shouldn’t worried point locking room biting nails off, chance contract covid, you’re extremely unlikely die, actually still stands true regardless whatever pre-existing conditions throw mix. paper day suggests UV may weakly correlated lower covid, you’re quoting sounds unsupported research. noble ideal, sorry, we're selfish, son's life worth anyone's young get vaccine wear mask lots health problems, want country vaccinate everyone first go again. common belief ""people intentionally go try get STIs""... ? I'm pretty sure not.

No one said that, willing accept risk. treatable disease. fact studies shown since PREP introduced cases Gonorrhea identified treated PREP requires screening every three months, resulting treatments fewer unidentified cases. do. see everyday outside.

You literally said see people packed bars restaurants. Obviously big stigma would like us believe that's case. ""trying shame people"". I'm pointing objective facts. 


No, not. using emotional pleas try shame hard truth is:.. community society cannot survive everyone dies. 


Emotional plea, logical fallacy. Everyone die, even let virus run rampant without mitigation strategies happen. less saying ""We care people die slow horrible (preventable) death.""


Another emotional plea ignoring many different aspects pandemic. person eating restaurant, working public, seeing friends, mean taking precautions, means identified level risk they're willing take safeguard physical health, mental health, economic circumstances. 


You're conflating taking risk, taking risks, trying shame people adhere every precaution decided reasonable. Nope, that’s theory evolution works actually. think works like going explaining reality completely wrong! Definitely promising look future countries able provide kind coverage. It’s pretty amazing.

Thank trying. feel good changing mind one. That's big deal! get 150 million people received atleast 1 dose 100 million fully vaccinated end April?  Lol wouldn’t. What. Definitely. I’m totally willing make party waiting line. No, masks don’t take away freedom, wear one, fact I’m vaccinated. It’s odd people like sit pretend everybody gets covid dies, it’s actually rare occurrence. Washington me. like 3 4 times rate look excess deaths FL reports. accurate comparison would many plane crashes midair collisions whole point vaccine get us back daily lives. vaccines incredible. So, I’ll living life normally fully vaccinated. I’ll course wear mask required it’s right thing do. ""Immunity""? pounding water orange juice. recommended limit ibprofen take 2 doses day? don’t think Florida anything correct covid laughable Australia New Zealand short term strict localised lockdowns eradicated community transmissions enjoying true freedom. political structure support that, fastest method contain outbreaks. Yeah, outside major cities suburbs, people happy general idiots reject science vaccines. want live the, “It’s bad news says,” fantasyland. Rural MI world hurt can’t get people. area 20% fully vaccinated open folks 16+....and daily vaccine rates look dropping fast. It’s pretty sad 1 5 vaccinated demand vaccines dropping quickly.

Adenovirus vector vaccines like J&amp;J AZ pretty much same, use adenovirus get mRNA cells. US would unconstitutional. That's really interesting meaningful though. virus mutates constantly person person. Sars Cov 2 much evolutionary potential. mutate much still remaining transmissible virulent. 

It continue mutate, really hard say significantly. virologists think seen covid-19s potential many tricks left bag. USA update first dose shots:

The good news overall dates change ton. days added 50-60% numbers (we likely need get 50-55%, higher obviously better) still in-person dining? Smh... Combine mRNA vaccine HIV, cancer, you’ll taste roaring 2020s 1960s vibe, gotta make lost hook ups.  I've interested since beginning range outbreaks individual states U.S. first half pandemic, range wide. states massively better others, measured cases per capita. started changing toward end 2020. Everything started converging. last time checked (last week), 35 states within one standard deviation U.S. total, 46 within two. four outliers, low side, tiny states (VT) states unique characteristics (HI). Michigan's recent surge taken closer U.S. average 9.7% tested positive, contrary conventional wisdom still below.

Basically, heading toward remarkably uniform distribution across states, regardless policies political orientation, least among states sizable populations. want ""hero"" states, Oregon Washington closest, effect marginal. 2.5 weeks second dose I've already bought tickets baseball game later month tickets Disneyland couple months friends spent time since August. 

After year keeping course I'm going party safe friends so. headline lock measures social distancing works. actually. Opening indoor dining little impact case volume. Bars, hand, absolute spreader. long wear mask walking restaurant seated, even unvaccinated okay. Yes? super normal. Right. Wonder think flying natural, knee replacements, hip replacements. literally anything advanced science. Sure, places spread too. even sober people restaurants cant wear masks eat, masks moot point, except people go bathroom, small share time usually talking (well, least men) Make cost covid care coverage medical insurance Medicare/Medicaide dependent vax record.

Black person (rightfully) skeptical vaccines due past injustices pushed them. Black person bankrupted Covid zealot wants increase healthcare costs. sounds like great idea huh. mean Michigan pretty much disaster right even almost 50% adults one shot. It’s kids now, quite adults coming despite vaccinated. new variants ugly. see CNN saying complaint fact interview.  One. 

What rest interview? Source? People uteruses take hormonal birth control higher risk blood clots, nobody throws fit 🙄🙄 would borderline abusive parent let kid hang peers entire year. actually can't imagine scarred child parent like would be. addition mental stunting immediate misery would cause, kid would forever considered weird paranoid peers parents' decision. went little 2 weeks out. Funny enough, I'll seeing team diamond visit LA. Let's go Dodgers. forget disinfect quarantine mail! got 2nd Moderna dose today. first one hurt bleeding injection site. 


The 2nd today stung first, took bandaid off, blood, enough cover cushiony pad bandaid almost completely.  


Anyone else experience something similar? I'm wondering person administers - two different locations, two different people. one 65+ cohort, got second shot couple weeks ago. relief! times Pfizer. 

Didn’t feel shot mark swelling. Even coming back getting shot couldn’t pin point exact spot arm delivered. 

Definitely sore arm times though. side effects second shot general. Add China list. Ya think? everyone ready cut loose point. Even us oldies. solid argument least partially explain it! still, try avoid getting natural immunity vaccinated immunity close virus protein shell DNA inside. outer shell change viral replication.
You keep catching cold every year virus keeps mutating.
The virus Covid-19 spreading rampantly India billion people. virus going combine recombine variants mutate deadly version disease.
The kind thing also happening America Brazil . replication mutation.
It new idea. new idea people seriously thinking one vaccine going give immunity virus control many parts world mutations arising fast vaccines keep up.
Add virus passing cats, dogs, pigs birds possibility’s endless.

The way get top everyone stay put travelling everyone vaccinated.
That going happen, talk travel vaccinated people already started world vaccinated.
Due stupidity human race virus finished . 3 million people opening volley. vaccines? free/fully covered insurance July? Yeah, they've also clinics fieldhouse weekends. vast majority students know shot. significant portion did, 5-15% Uhhh, going work say ""mask distance 0 covid cases."" people acting like decent strategy? *Maximally immune. Vaccines confer “full immunity”. ""Stabby Wabby?"" virus elect politicians made public health restrictions. did. results restrictions *our* fault, virus'. argue consequences restrictions bad virus, can't act like microscopic virus decided close schools make kids wear masks year. elementary school's motto lmao Whether show papers certain rights mean adding papers different rights. literally definition slippery slope, one that’s normally logical fallacy it’s actually coming fruition method thinking don’t think what’s going even remotely compares what’s happening Myanmar. 50 percent Israelis vaxed, include exclude 18? need 50 percent total population 18?  got 2nd Moderna today! 4 hours arm already starting feel sore. took around 12 hours 1st shot arm get sore besides that, one night chills/headache. rough couple days arm already sore? liver issues gets bad, I'll tough without Tylenol/Advil. haven’t scarred anyone. virus covid-19 virus? not, saying haven’t really done anything wrong.

All replies thread. It’s strawman. I’m going use children cause - I’m child don’t know children well bearing mine. I’ve lost something too, however minor grand scheme things. It’s dishonest say done virus. People chose me. think justified tradeoff problem. made sacrifice greater good like everyone else. choice.

I would see data spread *by COVID deniers* measurable phenomenon. thought disease spread people general. 

It seems like engaging conspiratorial thinking want define particular group responsible pandemic happened us. People may take pandemic less seriously lot people much believed pandemic exists still got infected passed others. I'm saying America covid, said people acting way, I'm sure could argue go outside. Well masks distancing gonna gone coming months.... would sick dying without vaccine good news young folks lean progressive. Every young person know excited getting vaccine. exactly. reports latest 24 hour time period reports come days late. shows shots given day. Notice last days different color mark uncertainly actual shots given. saw articles day saying new P1 variants found w/ even mutations matter time. Focus hospitalizations here. We're densely populated going awhile case numbers drop appreciably, seeing hospitalizations declining slowly. means vaccinated population beginning impact. still get covid vaccinated many employers insisting weekly testing still inevitable asymptomatic cases captured. long translate hospitalizations, we're golden. TLDR - actions individuals evened situation better worse regardless state mandates lack of.

We kicking around work (in moderate restriction state - mask mandate, distance gathering size restrictions, etc.). Ohio Florida took different paths terms breadth length mandates, death rate per 100k almost even though Florida fire.

Our theory even mandate states, there’s solid core 20-30%-ish refuse follow spirit mandates dumb stuff like wear mask nose un-masked/non-distant gatherings homes, etc. reverse true Florida-like states, people trying best safe. end without expected safety mandate state also without tidal wave infection disaster non-mandate state. virus did

They lot better Sweden, know. Texas, Georgia, Florida also examples.

The truth solitary confinement prison policies slapped kids afraid entirely you.

When cried certain racist president scarred children early development, well... become claimed stood don’t even understand point. we’re sick and/or dying, supposed help? 

The oxygen mask analogy seems like good one me. 🚀 🌝 💎 🙌 Weird. get appointment calling online? Yeah nothing says party like gf cooking chicken grill mom people get get spread virus faster mutate likely mutation contagious deadly.  simple math. far understand known peer-reviewed published wondered extreme suppression policies could prolonging pandemic. point US's functioning impaired could deliver vaccines countries wanted to, hence oxygen mask analogy applying. year since pandemic began can't recall pregnant woman affected life. Say louder people still inside. well-deserved respite next Great Depression ""Does fully"" implies close offering full protection, see misleading. always true. Men dance best. country still function fine even vaccinate single one citizens.

??? past year? I’d hardly say US functioning “just fine.”  pandemics last 18 24 months. We'll see :) It’s like mini-Myanmar police side! Meanwhile, Indian PM busy campaigning state First off, quote entire post.

People deleting posts happens annoyingly often discussing controversial topics. people regularly delete whole account history too. like context posts. I'm old fashioned. Nothing seriously logic extended long want to. whole “bare minimum” thing cop out. 

I disagree bare minimum. feel burden wear mask public. accept opinion probably ever understand point collectively decide get back normal Covid something need learn live with.

I mean, there's plenty places world got low enough could drop mandates. see us yet. I'd rather push harder earlier enjoy higher quality life drop mandates. 

The problem wearing mask pandemic restricts freedom people can't risk spaces higher risks. Unless something like vaccine passports/papers one could freedom associate people, suspect would agree significantly worse asking people wear masks. get population numbers low enough, know risk infection lurking around low enough drop mask mandates altogether. mean like driving Hondas, Toyotas, BMWs, Audis, Mercedes, Volkswagens, Ferraris Lamborghinis. may case, live Australia, people exposed covid. almost getting reactions/side effects Astrazenica vaccine, Pfizer one making people sick too, nowhere near much. 

It obvious covid here, many tests available people test positive, become sort mini-celebrity amongst friendship group one people here. definitely common amongst population reaction vaccines 65. (I can't speak 65s little cohort.) think incorrect assumption make someone may covid reaction vaccine. 1) USA almost completely open places. 

2) largely avoided 4th wave, unlike Canada Europe, despite us way open them...this vaccine working. claims fear mongering. Nah, it’s bullshit request. Adenovirus vectors aren’t good J J want drag Pfizer Moderns mix. Vaccination technology fundamentally changed Pfizer, Moderna others made winning bet. That’s works. Even vaccinated still carrying virus they’re unlikely hospitalized severe case. Yeah nobody stopped spread. want bro, nobody stopping anyone restrictions, live life way want now. burden solely retail store greeters enforce mask usage, burnt trying prevent selfish people spreading plague around say anything anymore. moron quotes science links article guardian 😂 Immunity takes kick (2 weeks second injection best efficacy), cases take go (incubation time, etc. - several days couple weeks). 

Things likely start get better matter days, weeks. ""So many people"" vaccinated. Ohio's vaccination 1 4 people 20s least one shot go way 65+ find age group half completed vaccination. 

We making good progress, yet. Brazil even Catholic country anymore We're going reach herd immunity one way another. road herd immunity paved bodies unvaccinated.

At point, fuck 'em. turn shots, that's you. 0 fucks left give. grandma also refused get vaccine. started symptoms weeks ago Tuesday, called regular doctor said could see/test Thursday. tested positive day, admitted hospital following Monday, kids make decision take Bipap let go Thursday. Nine days first symptoms. (Also Dade City, FL) think low? Everyone know jumping chance (I'm 24 health conditions got #1 end March) statistically administering similar amounts states high 80% efficacy preventing severe disease, lower number prevent mild/moderate disease. Hope so, thanks! control group. may appear like one you, isn't. random, groupings random, cannot use general population. Dude kids....

They deep, understand this. epidemiologists tell government shut play grounds keep factories open? Stop quoting science though monolithic body can't influenced politics. far there’s infections 0.007% fully vaccinated people. exactly lot people carry spread. say least everyone wants one get one. None available I’m at. can’t even schedule appointment except city 2 hours away. Well problem anymore. cleanup crew hand... helpful, thanks! numerous pills keep alive. wonder societal obsession corona rules, mandates mores re-run something like centrally-planned economies.

The draconian rules policies failed spectacularly centrally-planned economies did.

It happens people get heads solution big problems big daddy entity ruling micromanaging everything. that's level thought child.

Decentralized beaten centralized every single time. recent striking example cryptocurrency, never supposed work yet kinda making normal currency start looking anachronistic plunge vaccines... people used masks would sharp massive vertical fall. guarantee please tell me... Unless getting tested every week probably covid know cause asymptomatic... people really bad first vaccines generally covid before... That's known thing. asymptomatic. Lol literally give free condoms public services. nothing Catholicism. Kerbaaaalllll want shirt. It’s rad. say mask distance 0 covid cases.

**You** one said -- presumably, easier argue extreme strawman argument. sane world, probably mask reach something like 65 - 70% vaccination rate. recognize human beings partially blame this.

And ones covid deniers spread it, ones year can't come better idea lock everything down. remember seeing studies India last summer showing large cities already showing high percentages covid antibodies - speculation already reached partial herd immunity ? Northern California, Bay Area, fared relatively well throughout pandemic. Coincidentally, Bay Area first part US order shelter place last year. interesting look ""Per Capita"" map page (keeping mind different rates testing states): reasons behind various areas' performance complex. there's plenty good science suggesting lockdowns social distancing work, commenter said. mom high risk, went lunch said would getting vaccine. really feel like arguing said I'm getting soon available see took shortcuts process testing, trials, etc. end conversation, back forth, see post week later received first shot. prove wrong, require 2 lies concerned journalistic integrity? far I’m aware, main issue. doesn’t concern you, don’t know say. guess media lying night ok, not?

Give break. Stop spreading unscientific misinformation get educated. embarassed spreading false talking point. part problem. 1% low considering huge vaccine rollout, whole UK reporting 2-3000 positive cases per day almost 1 million daily tests (that's less 0.3%)

Maybe US tried prioritising 1-dose vaccine strategy like UK, reduced deaths much faster (US still reporting 20-30 times numbers daily deaths cases even worrying possibility Pfizer vaccine efficient claimed preventing spread virus (UK used AZ vaccine twice much Pfizer) - might explain CEO's recent suggestion 3rd dose would needed early 6 months later.  Idk hell live it’s seldom occurrence see people walking around outside mask unless it’s city. Source: Northeast. got first dose thursday, today day I'm count!  That's comment that's fear mongering? missing hundreds day claim never going back normal? governments. bet cheaper banking bailout paid couple years ago. 

If would done year ago, could already done pandemic. need take look New Zealand Australia ultimately switched NZ model. Yeah, inadequate purification methods used adenovirus vector. Versus two versions mRNA vaccine issues despite nascent unrealized technology pandemic.  


The world moving mRNA vaccines.  opposite me. live SF. That’s stopped responding lol - gave CDC estimates number infections 4.6x higher reported. would put us 145m cases 570k deaths .4% death rate. 

That's still lot higher flu close 600k deaths massive toll, probably wrong.  guarantee didn’t covid already, thanks assuming. Yet every time Google covid first 40 headlines blood clots, needing third dose, etc. fear stories lack context. Maybe actually headlined good stories like people wouldn’t freaked Outside sure I’ll hang them, indoors though. Thankfully friends vaccinated now, giving week two Rattlesnake venom natural it'll number you. really understand ""natural"" used way imply something must good healthy. Hell, COVID natural.  related want around people really? confirm, fully vacinated 72 year old mum eager wine friends. unfortunately outdoor socialising allowed moment England next 4 weeks weather big problem. lack government vision made worse.

Lockdown supposed emergency measure, persistent norm last year. CDC found 80% efficacy two weeks FIRST shot. Messaging definitely overly cautious. Nobody wants here, go away. San Diego county passed 50% partially vaccinated well. Oh, guess I've hallucinating past year then. 2 weeks slow spread order ease burden hospitals must figment imagination. Thank God. worried I'd wade dead bodies street caused mask regulations lifted vacation next week. wanna point dont *have* kids. see sort jail sentence (ie. Saying last summer without freedom) might wanna explore childfree life another option. day age get choice! S/O kids lives better it. *please note say knowing situation qnd wanted know kids isnt lifescriptTM requirement anymore =)  look happened Indian vaccine manufacturing effort. 


The biggest surprise Indian government still hasn’t placed long term order vaccines domestic suppliers. easier suppliers get materials guaranteed orders given population need everything can. got text yesterday saying could book mine (which unexpected I'm 45) 9.30am today, back home 10. 
My arm, rest me, starting ache bit (9.30 pm) I'm going bed. get stuck orbit slowly die thirst supply water dwindles. people can't even take cue religions: second biggest religion India canceled annual pilgrimage looks like even want board plane Saudi Arabia late year full vaccination mandatory.  Yep. least, get dirty looks. 

I moved area (in Northeast) middle pandemic felt like weird culture shock. I'm sure true throughout NE -- live college town, might influencing norms -- I've seen folks get lots pushback Twitter asking consistently wear masks outdoors ([e.g., here's one guess broadly shared throughout NE Well make sound easy!

Its insane quickly creates least kind tested vaccines compared previous pandemics. Asking 1000x speedup completely unrealistic. Current tech also can't respond immediately new variants virus still spreading globally, there's simply many hosts chances advantageous mutations pop up.

The vaccine companies started working updating recent variants months ago, honestly time produced distributed may longer primary variants. made incredible strides, asking nearly immediate global vaccinations realtime mutation updates never going happen. Tell 500 people protesting outside house... might, might, strategy shutting travel then.

Get vaccine rest world, shut international travel variants get here.

But apparently shutting flights blasphemy sub reason. read first give even stronger reaction

What?!?

No. area. point want see human lives saved idiots area want them. would sadly ironic.  without penalty would setting much greater health financial risk. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The vaccinated + recovered unvaccinated point still holds true can't lifestyle much longer. Herd immunity USA going line. laughed two levels, well done. well sound morbid closer achieving herd immunity globally Dunno everyone, certainly availability, might well use it. countries people don’t seek medical care severely ill, median age low. Vietnam 30.

Just look reported data you’ll see doesn’t remotely resemble sort trend first world country presents. Reporting data cannot good infrastructure doesn’t exist. well sound morbid closer achieving herd immunity globally No, one original six. Doctors hospital died strongly believe clotting caused vaccine. autopsy confirmed death caused clots heart. hospital testing reported death well. mean half. Half Americans vaccinated 3 months....still can't seeing almost over? vaccinate enough get herd i

No disease voluntary vaccines ever achieved herd immunity.

No disease vaccines provide temporary immunity ever achieved herd immunity.

COVID both. media wrong leading us believe herd immunity even possibility. area. Went dinner drinks happy maskless folks everywhere. I'm thankful fast vaccine roll United States! estimated well half californian adults eligible state made everyone eligible 15th, thats largely occupations prioritized added millions people eligibility rolls. furthermore, whole state moved 16+ 15th, cities counties allowed earlier, know city los angeles 10th, places earlier Taking Tylenol vaccine recommended afterwards totally fine Thanks, probably due lack sourcing information. Otherwise idea either. Proportional total number cases young people proportional total number hospitalized cases. experience hospital gives insight what’s going hospitals outside (no?) possible there’s unhospitalized cases young people? *only* people know personally getting vaccinated Christian conservative, I'm surprised given people personal experience.

Plus statistics back ~50% Republicans refusing vaccine, Christians Republican. That's cost vaccine itself. problem rather logistics cost network allows everyone get vaccinated fast almost simultaneously. Oh god, actually quoted Joker. literally quoted comic book villain. Oh god, satire. State laws vary, catch trafficking charge possessing small amounts various drugs. could get everyone else suck get it. vaccinated everyone house that's eligible including myself, despite pregnant moms acted trying abort child. also got 17 year old vaccine soon available younger kids getting too. Way Basically, saying ""normal"" people like anime. I'm that's nerds totally honest. I'm near age know single person near age watches it. I'd probably ask going grow up.  Right now? Yea according many people Sub continuing mask mandates equivalent Holocaust levels persecution. Neither India's testing numbers, India's death toll anywhere close reality.

I speaking Indian colleague essentially cremation grounds implement token system numbers running early hundreds single district.

Vaccinations, essential drugs, oxygen cylinders Covid related medicines stock. Hospital beds full municipal hospitals, beds shared patients.

Ironically, Prime Minister election campaign there's reason believe he's used money collected last year Covid relief election campaign.

This pandemic yet. going able walk outdoors without masks? There's new Slate article arguing masks outdoors extremely little prevent transmission (seems like common sense me), every time I've seen posted here/on Twitter poster gets shouted down.

I get people mind masks -- that's great! us do, social pressure cities' mandates rolled back? I’ve spent 2-3 hours outside everyday (barring rain) since March 2020, second shot beat crap me. dad 65 doesn’t go outside lot side effects. hits everybody differently. people get vaccinated ones taking precautions avoid getting it. county Ohio boat, we're trending badly upwards despite vaccine practically walk-in adults point.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

That's strange cause say two questions ask (which prio 3) they'll tell turn yet. would know, checked again, lol. *ivermeticin flashbacks* got second dose yesterday 🙂 different kind clotting, less deadly, treatable Heparin. deadly Heparin make worse. teacher, tell kids rebounded great scores mental stability. handled better adults. kid done tremendous made new friends. kids alright! I'm teacher recently got kids in-person. students came back got option September, one kid stayed home. One child class. poor thing isolated FaceTiming one best friends class. becoming bored, distant, frustrated situation. 

I kept trying convince parents send back things like ""her handwriting really suffering/ incredibly distracted paying attention/ critical thinking suffered greatly/ learning stagnated."" 

This week, happiest, excited student I've ever had. literally jumping joy going first recess friends. asked best part week dismissal yesterday said, ""Doing REAL art!"" using in-class papers, paint, glue scissors, ect. 

I understand people scared, parents school staff PUSHING BACK sending kids in-person (at least partially) going really hurt kids they're supposed helping. know places genuinely dangerous, heart breaks kids. hate fucking virus. Dr. Gottlieb said multiple times it’ll tough getting 150m people US vaccinated. We’re already 128m one shot. People 16-17 (outside Pfizer) can’t even get vaccine yet. Hopefully able get past number. control group health care workers get shot also know ""protect themselves"" ""have better access health care knowledge care"" Low risk people take mostly protect others.

Incorrect. take protect freaking ass freaking long-covid petes sake.  Anybody 16+ US wants shot able get least one dose June work school. kids completely fine. I'm good teacher, got record scores growth raw number. came hungry learn right teacher, get right back need be. session year, masks social distancing, allow anyone go elearning wanted (about 25% did), came back test, almost well in-school peers. mental health, great, playing sports modifications, playing lot video games. teach multiple grade levels again--the kids well resilient! third-world countries covid list healthier US? Seriously?

The mental gymnastics astounding.  socially distance quarantine, virus could left unchecked burned faster. However, potential risk even higher death count 3 Million globally (so far). Instead, US State live in, health officials mandated strict quarantine allowed hospital get inundated, prolong virus's effect community. entirely negative, since medical community scientists also able learn working (and not) earlier cases apply best practices later COVID cases.

 
In meantime, scientists also able develop vaccines help herd immunity. So, instead relying infections produce herd immunity, benefit vaccines well. avoid death rate 1918 flu (which infected 1/3 world's population) estimated killed 20 50 Million. 
There 4 waves 1918 pandemic lasted 1920.  cartoonishly fucked Well nurse doctor, md. again, reflective. 

For one, could aware protect themselves. Or, could better access health care knowledge care. Live up! elderly chronically ill homebound. Switching 2 shot vaccine doubles number truck rolls required vaccinate number people home. slows distribution high risk population means deaths. pause kill people side-effect. see huge drop vaccinations? feel like that's really worrying yeah? That’s probably south, restrictions never really enforced first place another surge. combination vaccine rollout larger percentage natural immunity exposed states never really locked significant way. states like Michigan northeast states surges. well Europe Canada’s surges. 100k got first dose within 600k, 2nd doses done too. Yep People made act like over. work decided pretty much back normal soon first nurses able get vaccines. people vaccinated, regardless waited full time effectiveness, think whatever want despite never 100% efficacy first place working people generally time fully vaccinate yet. That's reason. branch mathematics. health care workers health levels ages. anything worse general public due exposure. Feel free provide actual reason representative. you’d labeled “selfish” anyone pro-lockdown. swear, still last year progress vaccine, wouldn’t talking like this. found 78% people hospitalized COVID obese. God forbid let children go play let’s lock fat Angelina chooses scarf two Big Macs Funny shutting economy made rich even richer country, poor even poorer. Yes saved many lives, destroyed many things example, me. I'm flying halfway across world NYC 3 weeks get vaccinated. I'm even American. Sweet summer child see. Thanks giving source doses cannot shared. understand contracts signed intent vaccinating Americans first future something needs changed doses sit around unused. Massachusetts also averaging ten deaths per day. state almost 7,000,000. low entire pandemic.

There average [ten deaths given day Massachusetts. Vaccines won. even read article? 

P1 mutation South African one number more. 

I agree data needed ignore silly. Feel free go look death toll Amazonas. 
Not mention elsewhere. 

Like literally dude:

""Covid-19: Brazil, young people become variant's prime Lockdowns didn’t much CA covid capital country last winter.

Whoops lol making joke using r word wallstreetbets reference... know hate hearing flu comparisons, even disease vaccine gets yearly variants update keep probably forever. Many us want want wait 3 months safe. Also may better vaccine then. mask-mandate remain Dec 31st anyway good reason people like wait. Also wants stand 4 hour long line?  pfizer site somewhere. google site trials confusing... IIRC ""cove"" name study, helps. People saying ""Why can't wait bit longer X"" year now. differently folded spike protein mean Pfizer Moderna effective? still close enough vaccinated effective infecting without vaccine? 100% Old folks community fully vaccinated they’re refusing wear masks dismissing social distancing haven’t gotten it

It's old people, lot people vaccinated.

I one feel way, I've gotten vaccinated feels like mask nothing fucking prop point.

Are going wear masks cases go 0? still trying ""flatten"" curve? Messaging fucking sucked. people want accept fact coming end pandemic, least west.  can't comprehend brain works. effects vaccine different everyone. outside lot lately obviously prevent effects. contracts Trump administration signed vaccine manufacturers prohibit U.S. sharing surplus doses rest world. According contract language Vanity Fair obtained, agreements Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen state: “The Government may use, authorize use of, products materials provided Project Agreement, unless use occurs United States” U.S. clauses question designed ensure manufacturers retain liability protection, effect projecting Trump administration’s America First agenda Biden era. “That completely totally prohibited U.S. donating reselling, would breach contract,” said senior administration official involved global planning effort. “It complete total ban. legal parameters must change anything help rest world.”

Source: Amazingly USA still x2 amount deaths per 1 million people India. (But obviously evenly spread there's hot spots) India's population massive hard comprehend, India gets bad US Europe going see millions deaths India. particularly like either. I'd rather *another* instance I'm required show papers. basing on? absolutely empirical evidence support claim.

probably easier show businesses check NHS file..? called statistics.  Yes, includes entire population Israel, 18+ crowd. That’s makes situation even impressive, since essentially killed COVID without vaccinate single person younger 16. Yes holding back vaccines ordered means tourists skip que. even vaccinated medical staff globally yet. Canada still waiting orders &amp; sure hell need vaccines. slight income gained tourists compare wealth generated US / Canada's trade. Trade that's crippled Canada unable get vaccines administer. absolutely fundamentally false. Every DISTRICT offers them. districts multiple schools, especially poor urban areas. experience people. know sinus infection actually sinusitis, thick mucus can't clear quickly enough changes color yellowish green due contaminants air breathe? suffered sinus infections decades doctor explained infection, impaction cleared quickly thinning mucus drain. Since then, I've using generic mucinex drinking water rinsing sinuses day--not single ""infection."" 😭 India worse 2020. real evidence tbh They’re rare can’t really draw conclusions. Covid vaccinated people different flu, occasionally people die flu. You’ll fine. There’s always another war another recession/depression/financial crisis. It’s like predicting it’ll rain point NY Mets favorite squadron. term roaring 20s usually imply end decadence joy, looming catastrophe devastating world war, - hope - actually take place anytime soon.

I state driver's license one cared. Illegal immigrants supposed included government wants everyone vaccinated.

It's fun PR move, especially draw non-Americans. CDC says wear masks two layers, completely cover nose mouth, fit snugly sides face, don’t gaps, nose wire. 

That's public narrative, yes. organization turns around tells professionals cloth masks PPE.

Instead greatly ramping supply, narrative given public increase availability PPE important Anytime anyone meets face face they're spraying large droplets though, I'm sure get point. Lots friends, family, coworkers regularly meet person, doors, without masks said poor quality poorly fit.

And things clearly reflected nearly-uncontrolled spread Contract tracing seemed show vast majority time transmission comes close contact walking room infected person two hours prior.

Contract tracing, oh that's rich. Barely happens USA, guess. reality, quite difficult accurately determine infection source. I'm Canadian wholeheartedly agree guy pound sand Good! I'm glad places giving thresholds. need this. Young people aren’t sudden getting sick compared couple months ago. think that’s pretty clear. Deaths continue downward trend. Every week goes less fucks given gets vaccine. Bama Georgia probably good bets. Could possible, *maybe* possible, different kids react differently? non-Americans get strange thrill America suffering. Expecting people hold end social contract pragmatic way handle pandemic? Young people, people, inalienable right go get drunk friends bar eat half price mozzarella sticks Applebees whatever. 

When comes rights, thing I've always ""angrily screamed at"" whole life ""your right punch face stops tip nose"". Well right get infected deadly virus stops tip *my* nose, wild mostly people spent last year squawking much lives held back amounts slight inconvenience are. get can't stay lockdown forever look forward life part. However, that's goal let's take needed steps get get fucking shot. can't ways; open economy refuse mask/get vaccinated. Oooh hand wave desantis telling coroners specifically report Covid deaths now. Oh didn’t realize that, TIL. Thanks corrected info! problems 3.5 year old friend circle (3-5). just-turned 2 year old family like mask would fuss it, time 2.5 problems.
    
   
Of course kids alike, difficult others. kid comply sitting car seat, getting wear mask must difficult.
   
  
But that's OK. one's going throw jail toddler keeps ripping mask. point best. month vaccines situation look pretty different. literally terrible response government top bottom Lol baseball match Half million dead Americans would like word you, can’t. 

Because fucking dead. going young people.... experience check ID, mostly check see live. They're also vaccinating undocumented folks questions asked. literally looked ID one second. Fingers crossed! Thanks giving hope get past tomorrow. got first Moderna shot yesterday too! actually felt nothing regarding needle afterwards, aching slowly crept end yesterday arm felt like pressed iron block, although seems like worst part night. arm feels much better today. say compared typical flu shot, getting first COVID shot like eating Thai chili pepper versus jalapeno pepper flu shot! Lol hell? comment uncivil? One thing we're learning pandemic virus highly contextual. example, Israelis much better following guidelines, even wearing masks *outdoors*. them, due willingness take measures seriously, perhaps need hit 70%+ cases drop significantly.

In US hand, stadiums filled 60,000 people baseball match Texas.

So apples apples comparisons.

We need give virus hosts possible limit opportunities mutate deadly transmissible form (even though viruses tend become less deadly).  really race vaccination variants everybody needs play part end soon possible. results Coronavac Brazil shown efficiency 50 percent preventing symptomatic infection.

No. says 50.4% include MILD symptoms. countries including US, got 1 symptom, counted. feels like way Georgia too!

Unfortunately people friend group recently gotten first shot, take small hiatus feel comfortable going completely understandable. hope sign small businesses chains going begin dropping masks soon.

It’s funny we’re time pandemic largely coming end lifting masks like bar-cade dividing people willing go. probably shows might tad early lifting masks I’m certainly going complain. Yeah that’s consideration. depend covid rates look like weighing risk mind.
My main concern child (who isn’t old enough get vaccine) already mis-c type condition years ago, concern it’s antibody related vaccine could cause reaction much infection. Since genetics I’d like see play bit talk taking vaccine supply places supply exceeds demand move places way around. Basically, get many shots done possible.

Once supply exceeds demand everywhere ramp advertising try get hesitant people get shots. Also, little lying numbers.

Don't get wrong, blame country (especially seeing would still mess patient zero US). also wear one two masks depending going long. I'm saying wrong. Actual lockdowns properly implemented

Same lockdowns...I feeling lockdown 2 3 weeks late. following happening Italy saw coming here. lockdown March 9, waited March 24. course main problems Health Care industry unprepared federal government leaving states...and course Trump... Chile far know study made based old people (just week 60 years old completed 2 weeks second dose, protection acquired). guess another study made reach lower age groups, since 47 years old getting first dose.

Needs happen point.

But hit herd immunity, soon.

Not matters - anti-maskers wont wear anymore.  Vaccines playing role sure herd immunity yet. probably helps weather nice people aren’t concentrated indoors. things heat up, AC play factor although hope family vaccines provide enough resistance avoid another summer surge.  vaccine asked show asymptomatic efficacy understanding. i'm ready, fear things go back normal like used people may case, there's fatality rate consider. fact people might get ""long covid"" serious health issues means need get vaccinated too, ASAP. problem people kicked road even education.

(And US people trying claim pretty much responsible approved vaccines [and coming someone US], it’s even important emphasize global effort).

Janssen subsidiary J&amp;J. It’s nice point global contribution sense, least company.

Niti aayog said foreign agencies still need nod. mention government balls deep money; money resources supply chain management bring moment's notice. take atleast 3-6 months make available general population. mention age cap atm. Given actual evidence literature, know bS fact thinking rational proves point. hilarious “The authors review called increased global efforts monitor SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

Better surveillance across broader range countries would allow us better risk assess next stage pandemic might look like,"" said authors.

""If want monitor ongoing emergence, spread, import potential vaccine escape mutants continue effort risk pandemic waves vaccine failure.

It's seems like finding ways throw shade US, I'm sure people like that.

Maybe stop using media outlet single source information.

""forgetting"" ... right three others market around globe relevant. Perhaps stop discrediting messenger actually concentrate relevant content. know BBC one report that. Discredit this.  word, Gao Fu guy use it. Besides, bring quality BBC reporting clear talking four vaccines inactivated ones (considering article talk inactivated).

And revitalizations, BBC bashing Gao Fu use word ""garbage"" means garbage. Got it. Since put much effort defending Gao Fu said, missed part stated wanted combine many vaccines? would anyone understanding 50% efficacy completely preventing COVID 50% reduces severity disease, far ""great"" ""garbage"" either, I'd call ""satisfactory"" ""will now"". quote article Chile linked:

For one, helps lessen anti vax crowd. Harder argue it’s dangerous politicians take vaccines get.

Also leader getting infected bad thing country. People panic leader gets sick.

HOT GIRL LEASH so, Hot Girl Summer? lol least ones Syria specifically American, know easy say, time widespread vaccination *will* come. then, y'all need get surge control. lot lives saved. considering spread it, focus people actually get vaccine instead trying discourage people allowing lives change vaccine.

Either way I've gotten gold confused Ontario's pronouncement outdoor gatherings.. know case count bad 30,000 day 'worst case' number BS. wear mask keep distance fine No, makes politicians seem like something. 1 40000 still less dangerous covid. agree better alternatives there, worth using alternatives instead It’s perfectly possible see figures people clots, it’s matter whether going look like hid evidence not. 

There study Oxford suggests mRNA vaccines increased risks clots also. aren’t open stats troubling, trouble you. George Carlin quote. usual, hearing say makes twice funny! jokingly.

The world US especially feel like teetering plank right we're either going embrace stupid really great time we're gonna get together. terrifying much support stupid lot hope. Yeah breakthrough clusters happen hospitals wonder that's like, optimal conditions covid vaccine breakthrough - body keep churning antibodies fighting max load forever? feels logical vaccines great can't really defend well absolutely showered virus daily.

For every vaccine get, virus something that's spreading like wildfire, might ever actually encounter virus life use immunity. meekly bottom sitting, revenge party time!!!!!!!!!! Bonus: pissing Perfect Peggy!!! (there whispers mask burning/giving Zoom bird soon Memorial Day too)

Also, stories people getting Covid right second shot... Hell no, *not* go whole year dance 3 yards end zone.

So I'm gonna patient exactly 20 days, personally. wonder means people apartment condo dwellers(the norm comes housing). president Moon (S Korea) got AZ also mean... pretty common countries? like massive hardship??? Looking Israel, herd immunity covid seems even lower experts predicted! Israel’s covid cases deaths plummeting even country reopens fast pace. little 60% Israelis vaccinated, puts herd immunity target 65% (again using Israel reference, hopefully it’s true everywhere). current rate US likely achieve immunity mid June! Even better, US much higher per capita covid rate Israel, means natural immunity likely higher America, meaning may reach heard immunity (cases declining time social distancing masking rates decrease) late May. sent several videos godmother, parents, mother-in-law, everyone said exaggerating, stop watching news, making paranoid. knew son himself, breathing normally.""

What article really saying want pretend hard it... there's money it. That's thing though outbreaks while, time one seemed possible we've jumped needed go lock down.

For perspective area lock since last year. That’s probably good people actually work. probably get done. Imagine this:

There 2 rooms 20 people each, one room vaccinated people one doesn't, guy that's infected covid enters tries spread disease every single person rooms, next days test every single person covid, room without vaccinated folks come positive, vaccinated room, 1 person comes positive. 95% vaccinated didnt get covid. call 8 million doses fail! Remember ""mutant"" reserved X-men.  curiosity, explain would make comment? presented incorrect conflicting information, please let know. Yes concern would thrombosis, that's literally it.

I problem vaccination besides that, absolutely plan get point. unsure risk thrombosis actually higher getting covid given current status state. rare are, getting covid seems really rare least now.

I appreciate response though! massive unrest this. mindblowing people ok insane rules studies determine efficacy forcefully expose people covid, efficacy numbers establish bearing would happen one exposed.

Got first shot Moderna yesterday. side effect I've soreness upper arm oddly enough began immediately shot went in. know concerned not, I've read soreness started many later on. Still, I'm glad able get shot. There's export ban; simply agreed fulfill obligation US first deal signed.

My understanding Canadians going US honour system whatever want terms quarantine, come Canada US hit stupid quarantine hotels 10 day quarantine afterwards. demographics get vaccine flu, country fine. person charge nurse claiming doctor, none staff masked, clinic small turnover, Moma claimed work CDC said later Colorado Department Corrections.

The article missed half tea. sure individual states around 6k fully vaccinated people gotten covid 80 died. Good call. Michigan spike cases vaccinated numbers arent yet. I'm 27. soon fully vaccinated, immediately started going bars, friend's houses, etc. great live life could solved marketing messaging didn’t suck ass. glad see people going mask little germ spreaders up. let’s teach anti-maskers wear one!

Nice job jumping conclusions though! Naive. planned paid for. think geographic location population mask adherence matters too. kid turned 2 right pandemic started hard get wear mask, everyone neighborhood 2+ wearing mask normal thing. imagine would lot harder get wear lived somewhere lot mask resistance. applaud Michigan.

I’m trying explain what’s happen epidemiologically Florida. refuting assertion “young people aren’t sudden getting sick” evidence supporting hypothesis elsewhere, could factor Florida well.

Even then, what's point paying full tuition can't even step foot campus. Plus likely another year masks social distancing even vaccinated. ultimate reason US secured doses vaccine 4 months EU. agreed buy even considered ready, EU waited testing certification. Given poorly (the US) handled actual pandemic, I, one, glad we're getting many shots arms means give finger anti-mask idiots regard other's lives. actually bit curious friend mine recently asked (to idea honestly), would happen decided get two shots Moderna two Pfizer shots? medically ok capable boosting immune system even risk it? crazy governments still making decisions based outdated info last March/April mean locations US them, much less enforce them, many locations, particularly bay area, social pressure contributes outdoor masking. make much sense maintain distance, agree, social expectations make much sense general.

I say person runs outside mask on- worth dirty looks, even though I'm fully vaccinated easily keep distance anyways Alberta, thankful things looking particularly bleak answer obviously yes. Whether admit different story.

Just anti vax, anti science. Dumb. send Canada... free healthcare sucks  Still waiting Texas Florida massive outbreaks. don’t agree restrictions, Ontario fucking requires greater measures/stay home enforcement shit absolutely control nice cheaper take fine quarantine home. system broken af side effects mean immune response, people experience side effects.  sort seems like whole population given up. I've seen massive parties full young people loads LGBT gatherings, doubt would voting him. 16 year old gets second shot next week. never shown anxiety pandemic obviously grinning ear ear rest day first vaccine. relatives 50 fully vaccinated, I'm relieved feels like weight's lifted shoulders. year really hard. 3 teenagers preteen. joys freedoms teenagers, going out, dating, dances, football games, first jobs etc squashed. try keep upbeat sometimes it’s hard ignore difficult depressing it’s been. 

I one graduated high school started college, one became junior HS, one graduated middle school started high school, one graduated elementary started middle school.

DARE prioritize risk people!!!?!?! Queue

Que Spanish ""what""   third shot now? 🤔 last visited berlin, people looked committed murder plain view jaywalked across fairly calm street really depends now. COVID shown cause problems pregnancy, whereas vaccines not. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen aspirin taken help pain vaccination. Alternatively apply cool wet washcloth affected area exercise arm. believe US less 5 weeks away peak vaccine everyone wants gotten it. got first dose pfizer around first day open ages 16+ completed second yesterday. Everyone know wants shot gotten least one jab Vaccine would u get u now? I'm 2 weeks past second dose Pfizer bad side effects sept sore left upper arm say 18 hours. also mainly descended Dutch German people. Quick question vaccine protect strongly time. told someone last night ""it's 2 weeks 3 days since dose 2. protected get"" replied "" oh takes 3 months peak"" true always heard 2 weeks? disease ever eradicated smallpox. Every known disease still exists, common poorest part world. Black Plague still kills people. insane? fear? Good question, desire pay Canadian government. here! would shoot vacciene? nice It’s really selfish. Research still isn’t there, would really surprised find often vaccine spread virus easy haven’t. Isn’t act spreading related overall viral load? vaccinated, presumably body prevents huge viral load occurring become infected? absolutely right. Post Viral Syndrome occurs many illnesses. think main question right prevalent occurring among people get COVID-19 much population impact. seen recent numbers prevalence one point looking significantly prevalent Covid19 diseases compared iirc included influenza, SARS one two more. 
If reduce cases community help bring number people effected down. Also, clinics focusing working hard find treatments therapies help. 

TLDR: need continue work figuring prevalent PASC (long covid) comparison cases Post Viral Syndrome illnesses need work identifying refining treatment therapies people PASC (long covid).  already managed eradicate several diseases across world,

Actually disease completely eradicated smallpox. Every one still exists wild. completely non issues handful cases year, eradicated. Gotcha. Yeah, mean, there's probably protection place, full protection. would probably opt masks again, would suck someone catch bad case coronavirus close reaching full immunity. Outdoors would even better. 

Any particular reason things can't wait? wedding, everyone eager hang again? selfish people couldn’t even wear masks won’t care hopefully responsible people may think risk low enough skip vaccine right thing. people pay prices. That's expensive, elite, private universities cost. want pay less, go public school state it'll cost ~$10,000/yr tuition. education still good. Where? read articles. mention masking all. Got first moderna shot today. good id lying said arm doesn’t hurt. KILLING ME😂 advice? cases still going up? Started quite well first half year, since beginning fall 2020 went downhill.

No strategy slow spread really worked vaccination rate terribly slow. Cases risen new time high last month basically strategy place now.

Nothing ever worked since fall, lockdown since Christmas, people quit caring, regulations seem sometimes irrational help.
Also everybody fed point.

Most Germans sticked rules entire year, enough enough. think website gave corona fed that, also commandeering state supplies also. Title article says. situation facing one hard handle. Absolutely unknown disease, China literally buying entire world's PPE supply PPE supply chains country (refusing export), virus explodes everywhere. 

I agree way handled, understandable people make mistakes extreme duress sometimes bad decisions made. What's important fixed, was. Highly doubt - happened today. seem like getting better though - website screwed me, section ""bread crumb"" area said ""Add family members"" skipped go it, able sign family member. went redid registration family member, got end, appointments gone. :(

However, today line waiting leave getting first shot, able make appointment phone place even closer home days!

So I'd say least getting little bit better. 

I Pfizer. 3 hours ago. may little sleep, otherwise I'm fine far. Nah. said mask school anf public let go. say anything Fauci didnt. yes no..... many areas certain persuasion, masking mandates already dropped state leaders dead set reopening, regardless lives lost saved. Unfortunately regions there's vaccine hesitancy need participation huge % 20-somethings well teens even children (once approved) reach 70%+ herd immunity threshold. truth areas still see continued outbreaks &amp; clusters rest year. That's say close anything though... see. Yeah would play safe wait PCR test comes back. that's negative too, doctor thinks probably COVID, would say go it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* American living Canada. Canada’s dealings coronavirus year summarized one colossal fuckup. Canadians happy lower case counts US, US came around vaccines, Canada suddenly realized completely fucked.

I amazed much government entering everyone’s lives Canada. I’ve seen statistics say majority reduction cases results voluntary quarantine. would seem though many Canadians extremely compliant this. Canada issues mandatory hotel stay.

Canadians going parks it’s finally starting get warm winter depressing fuck. Canada (or Quebec case)? Issue 8pm curfew keep people inside patrol parks loads cops. Wonderful, full police state. 

Canada going fucked awhile. It’s real shame. used think whole “Merica, can’t take away freedom durh durh hur!” absolutely ridiculous, I’ve experienced country doesn’t seem give two cents individual freedom I’m starting get it. Canada obsessed making better place everyone literally make worse place everyone. said lot things true...that media said false ended true. Even Psaki admit one example week. HCQ later shown helpful btw. work way 3rd world countries Michigan alone accounts 10% daily US cases. appears plateaued/peaked there. Also, US close 40% vaccinated threshold caused metrics improve dramatically Israel UK. Give weeks.. Very. problem “let public choose level risk” employees (teachers, restaurant staff, grocery workers, etc) don’t get choose whether exposed people aren’t taking safety measures seriously. choice “be exposed quit end evicted can’t pay bills” that’s actually choice. Outdoor mask mandates never really made much sense me, tbh. since around last summer/early fall. believe it’s unfortunately Send link proving get shot. question. 100% experience, Trump said whole lot things untrue, things turned true. hard say ""he right"" cherry picking single example ignoring hydroxichloroquine, bleach, gone Easter, Democrat hoax... Etc.

We've got balanced hand evaluating performance. Every person sick gives virus chance mutate. reduce amount sick people 99% due vaccination, reduce probability bad mutant developing roughly amount (not quite get idea).

There's still chance every year get unlucky 1% get bad mutation, much less likely virus fewer chances mutate. Well good guess. advent social media nowadays, allowing people see opening ceremonies live ridiculous. could air live day overnight re-air taped primetime. happen last three non-Rio games (London, Sochi PyeongChang)  Yes.

Also, independent travel possible now, while. Things going continue odd mixed vaccination status population, unvaccinated majority. get higher vaccination rate, things truly get back normal.

I think would really interesting study comparing experiences depending someone vaccinated. vaccinated back January, nothing much changed 2+ months since reached full immune response. Granted, state still moderately high risk mandates favor caution, masks still required, capacity limits place, dining outdoor takeout/delivery only, etc. biggest changes reduced personal anxiety protection, ditched mask I'm walking dog (outside, breezy, distanced form walkers), many people sub would say over-cautious begin with. own. Oh, finally started getting takeout again, actually hung fellow vaccinated friend went outdoor-seating restaurant bite eat once.

The one thing expect big spike burnout. Still tolling away working every day, keeping routine. kind like running marathon finishing top 3%, celebration park/arena finish line located quiet empty there's crowd cheer finish. Yes, happy finished race, feel awkward hitting drinks &amp; hors d'oeuvres people start showing up. Instead waiting rest runners finish marathon celebrate cheer together. opinion yes, think selfish people avoid extremely effective safe vaccine pass risk others. (Note, say *mandate*, said *encourage*). 95% effective vaccine helpful COVID still circulating high levels testing 5% leakage every day.

Think way: Getting shot 95% effective bullet proof vest different getting shot 100 times. melodramatic example, get idea. know get vaccinated not.

I live NSW, Australia. active cases now, well months. Australia general chill heck. 

I get astrazeneca moment, unsure risk worth considering unlikely get covid. I'm immunocompromised immunosupressant now, that's factor sure.

My current thinking maybe get vaccinated there's outbreaks near me. get alternative vaccine course I'd soon possible. 

What think? would get vaccine knowingly widely scrutiny? Meh, nyc missed cases first wave impossible get tested.  Different study, done government larger scaled. story awesome, thanks sharing.

But.. dad sixties little brother born?  German government straight know do. We've going different kinds ""soft"" lockdowns almost year now. *really* controversial decision hard lockdown eastern, government backpedaled day announcing it. 

Our government crumbles lobby pressure. Hard. given rapid test negative , would go get vaccine. GI tract issues many reasons. probably best get vaccine ASAP. that's opinion. three children potentially high risk due genetic blood disorder. Would sign three heartbeat trials local. Every data group far points mRNA vaccines safe effective age level.  talking about? PA 14 public universities.

Usually run opposite misconception. Usually people think 15 falsely think Penn State actually state university. even think University Pennsylvania, Ivy League school, state also possible they’re taking proportionally number young people always have

I've following closely beginning work hospital. There's way true lol. honest opinion, possible. crash back Earth miscalculated fuel requirements Misleading title person i**mmunocompromised.** title makes seem like person average health died vaccinated true. Immunity virus last long, immunity vaccine does. Ah think confusing sinopharm sinovac, mixed results issue people going restaurants highschool contact sports.

Michigan Government: Try keep masks 2 year old, good luck! relatively easy summer ""but VAccINe NEw!"" made realize one several multi billionaires could easily build vaccine production site four various parts world. could donate completely, set trust run them. afterwards would still multi-billionaires money 99.99% world. I'd suspect could still money left time last year. Honestly, becomes normal people wear masks winter protect flu... might wear one winter keep face warm. masking sucked summer, cold out, really really mind it. one else it, would make look like doofus. second dose Blood cancer survivor well, Hodgkins Lymphoma 1a. ABVD radiation I’ve remission going five years first Astra Zeneca jab chat haematologist, you’ve rightly put it, isn’t enough data blood cancer survivors told haematologist. 

It’s bit worrying think even fully vaccinated Astra Zeneca could still significant risk given produce amount antibodies would regular person.

Most high risk people get vaccine would think. Hopefully there’s enough broad adaption herd immunity works well enough keep spread minimal. Yeah, want work remotely family home even pandemic ends. BMI 40 priority group 2, BMI 30 priority group 3. think she'd 40. think that's called plan A?

Hopefully reapprove J&amp;J next week. Hopefully aren’t making go work flu. one thing hope changes result pandemic- employers generous sick leaves aren’t penalized calling out. don’t need worry wearing mask public allowed stay home. always thought bad employers made people come temperature. enjoy!! I’m talking new one India killing kids. don’t know vaccines’ efficacy strain, I’m hoping pretty efficacious though. 

I Pfizer definitely believe vaccines, there’s lot studies coming says high vitamin levels also helpful, couldn’t hurt. White Boy Summer incoming.  people expecting us never reach herd immunity. 55% population summer seems likely me, eventually tick bit kids get vaccinated.

But extra 10% get us 70%+ could end crucial... look Israel, they're around 68% IIRC really crushing it.

I surprised limp finish line combination slowly convincing holdouts, social incentives (e.g. businesses requiring vaccination) strategic mandates (e.g. colleges, maybe healthcare workers).

Many multiples people die pause ever would affected extremely rare potential clotting issue. Theres nothing wrong work concerned businesses economy That's effectively happening Florida right now. Hospitalizations overall Florida older cohorts mean one thing....they younger cohorts. There’s far difference kids amount drink. Binge drinking still happens, again, happens less frequently past generations. Kids may still drinking, fewer drinking all, larger numbers drinking responsibly fewer drinks point reckless impairment. still needs accounted for. There’s major difference splitting case beer playing Mario kart home, going get blackout drunk. Today’s kids better that. (Percentage wise, obviously haven’t solved entirety underage drinking) one small city. It’s struggling past year I’m happy go help keep gay bar business. **Cause competitors don’t exist pandemic**. We’re social species crocodiles. 

J&amp;J held liable actions tbh gave companies impossible deadlines meet. 6 6 million women sounds like didn’t factor birth control punished. that’s pandemic. Right it’s fixing issue getting vaccines back track vaccinate planet. Yeah think that’s hangover! Example: - hospitalizations increasing recent data points. Maybe people vaccine? there's also lot people think I'm reacting say got strong side effects. zero side effects second dose YMMV 💪🏽💊💉🧬🧫🧪🔬🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲 time save world 4th 5th time. People crucify beginning China’s numbers undercount sure.  China I’m way trusting handle sh!t.  3 friends country can’t tell last time regional outbreak.  noticeable happen shut everything throw million tests it. It’s pretty noticeable happens word travels like wildfire.  friends don’t know anyone gotten Covid within past 5 months. Unfathomable... AstraZeneca production shortage EU due US export restrictions? thought AstraZeneca fucked (yield problems), due supply problems.

The one really saw complaining CureVac, said made difficult get materials due ban (so probably source elsewhere) say production capacity affected it. Also delivered dose yet vaccine approved yet. Great song. sure applicable Alaska tho never wore mask (besides work work surgery) last year haven’t flu since 2009 swine flu outbreak. must something right. I’ve also maybe 3 colds since also. 

I got sick much little kid bet immune system good fighting illnesses got older. Believe one irrelevant thinks that. Yeah, I'm looking forward going day trips etc definitely interested partying night lol probably Florida. confirm Alabama sure, probably Georgia well. use one vaccine spotter websites 20 places appointments get vaccine problems getting it. Yes. big spike MI. can't wait vaccinated count get big enough. action needed reduce transmission. Masks reduce transmission. Getting little kids wear masks help. IMO many 2-4 year olds taught wear masks without much hassle. government hasn’t caught fucking numbers. two parts controversy: last year, data scientist named Rebekah Jones claimed Florida reporting positive coronavirus tests. true—they double-counting people tested positive twice infection. also claimed properly reporting deaths didn’t count out-of-state residents died Florida. I’m sure make this—I don’t know states’ policies. Jones made dashboard rival state’s. dashboard much higher infection numbers also included people tested positive antibodies never tested positive COVID. I’m aware state included cohort infection numbers.

The second part controversy recent study found Florida’s excess deaths much high reported COVID deaths. Find state isn’t true. cases—all cases think except New York’s nursing homes—this intentional. people die COVID without testing positive. Others die something non-COVID couldn’t get proper treatment full ICU. Others die deaths despair, namely drugs.

People keep trying “gotcha” Florida doesn’t fit public health narrative last year. Lol government force another company help competitor. Sounds like ridiculous overreach.

The government hold J&amp;J responsible product ensure they’re everything right. kid easily worn mask store since started 2.5. Took three days adjust. Erm, might want check dozens sources thread, numbers disagree those... Actual 2-4 year olds, people acting like 2-4 year olds? latter bigger problem. Illinois, we're getting ready Roaring '30s... that's state finally open up. XD

On serious note, governor already said continue mandate masks social distancing long CDC says so. I'm sure he'll send ISP actually bust parties, still illegal gatherings, Mayor Lightfoot definitely would got chance. Hell, last year PERSONALLY drove around city yelled people about.

Imagine party, found girl (or guy). want get it, find empty bedroom. Things start great, opens door, staring menacingly you. good thought.  Fair concern, day 2. would also gladly wake mountains window feel better. here, got Thursday morning, felt terrible yesterday. Finally upswing, one step closer starting new D&amp;D campaign! completely serious, think sooo many STIs spreading around summer catch-up sex. Wrap tap it! strong survive. state state level. read this? dont mind asking oh great another ant1-vaxzer coming woodwork fight antimaskers that’s fail species. That’s bad lol extent that’s problem none covidzero strategy. 

You quash lockdown leave embers reopens people expectation we’ve done work it’s time party. 

But didn’t beat beast zero. it’s gonna roar back again.

Covid basically forest fire. gotta put every last ember. hundreds potentially thousands people incarcerated bullshit like possession marijuana... also work NHS (although different section) asked higher ups, also said likely used “passport”. 

If card, look back, says keep purse wallet Yes, people allowed selfish. looked morning 850 million, maybe numbers old finna fuuuuuuuuuck way knows go Walmart. [this video Indian government account. wish simple. south many anti vaxx people would remain lockdown forever. friend anti mask anti vaccination family go anywhere. ok restaurants shut forever home schooling kids getting groceries delivered. want wait (and like her) get vaccinated move life.  ""Oh someone think rapists murderers!"" state like Governor DeSantis, gotta give credit. funny true. took ibuprofen 36 hours second shot felt completely back normal 4 hours. That’s epidemiology analysis vaccine works. didn’t analyse effective polio vaccine exposing every single person got virus. good neither AZ J&amp;J, considering effectiveness similar. Funny thing inactivated vaccines without whole viral vector issue VIPIT. Chinese CDC head said effectiveness ""very high"". I.e high mRNA vaccines. true. idiotic media proceeded pretend say low efficacy. Ridiculous. Never saw media criticizing AZ J&amp;J widely ineffective. first dose always free charge. bet people bible walking around complaining “kids today”. It’s bullshit narrative US almost half vaccinated Canada going brutal third wave Ontario, Quebec, perhaps elsewhere. Canada dependent US it’s depressing. Canadians don’t like acknowledging maintain nation pride seems. You’re r/Coronavirus. you’re panicking believing 25 year old Reddit dropout, you’re taking seriously enough I’m pretty sure joking Florida like 7000 cases day still. Lmao. even suggesting? live masks restrictions forever? website bizarro world. 1.2 million active cases. 200,000 every day. Everyone needs able get vaccinated. US vaccinating teenagers speaks success. vaccine people looking get vaccinated start exporting.  totally confused quarantine tracking apps proof vaccination ""Being healthy individual something ask control."" kind arrogant BS form virtue signaling, moral failure people severe health issues. Someone weight gain side effect condition medication. Plus, news flash, excellence weight problem, looking sluggish nose people though somehow morally superior. fact wrote post proves not. health care workers health levels ages. anything worse general public due exposure.

You yet provide reason whatsoever health care workers representative. small gathering fully vaccinated friends? Sure. public areas around children (can’t get vaccinated yet) immune compromised (don’t respond well vaccine)? It’s common decency wear mask keep space it’s control.

Edit add - Also, read many young people waiting vaccinated gather even bothering get vaccinated they’ve heard many times they’ll fine catch it. That’s incredibly selfish. need ramp vaccine production 1000x least start producing vaccines mutants well, still tested probably need tested much previous test vaccine already safe anyway. Coronavirus closer cold virus flu virus, it’s related flu virus all. You’re using real terms it’s impossible respond you. old you? type like middle school. doin'? Hey man, head Chinese vaccine program said good, science says good. There's nobody left saying good. breed variants. pretending fake media fear porn people dying. close eyes pretend everything shiny fine reality stays bleak point open face it. crash eyes closed. What? said 100 million cases, speculative confirmed. correcting actual number. Seeing cases continuing rise areas, it’s clear we’re heard immunity.

What 1D way thinking feel need attack facts, weren’t invited many parties you? Right ya friend.  Exciting stuff! sympathy. tried best say bad decision got ***HATED*** even said ""we didnt lock hard enough selfish f\*\*k, need more!"". Oh well, get pay for. You’re reaction one percent normal shitty thing sister do. imagine found thing flu would pissed rightfully so. knowingly exposed virus shouldn’t congregating large groups. That’s fucked Pales comparison? don’t know I’d go far. realize 675,000 Americans died Spanish Flu mitigation vaccine? almost 600,000 deaths one year precautions place. There's life avoiding respiratory virus.

Except varies person person (because different people different levels risk). 

If run business (or place people congregate like Church School Fitness center whatever).. can't throw caution wind say :.. ""Hey.. whatever.. fend yourself!"" (especially infectious-disease that's going around slowly killing customers). 

People feel safe coming Event Gathering .. taking basic precautions help protect them. That's whole underlying point this. individual wants active part society, .they follow societies rules. That's society is. There's reason places rules like ""Can't randomly shoot gun air"" etc. think others beyond yourself. insurance, clear free. 

Also fact there's bill all... pay bill insurance government. 

I moved home across state lines pandemic job loss breaking live-in partner. stuff storage unit pervious state, HMO insurance plan CA, insurance employed pay pocket for. kept ""permanent address"" set grandmothers house lived five months going home holidays staying (travel freaked out). 

I got waste preventions shot, week started new job different state. stopped paying HMO insurance weeks pick new insurance still coverage pervious month. 

They told needed insurance number have. thought giving expired insurance number (they drop coverage 30days nonpayment could gone back paid another $400 one time get shot) 

 worried billing old insurance would flag I'm state would lose coverage flag benefit receiving period. 

They billed government, also prove lived Idaho address bill drivers license CA ID. Thank god still get mail parent's home. 

Long winded way saying, complicated unstable life is, uncertain getting shot regards pays, prove deserve it, knowing paperwork bring, fear using information tip someone else potentially lose benefits something else. I’m sure guns answer. certainly would want see people waving guns fight government, governments always firepower. 

I’m sure answer is, seems like Canadians, specially Quebecers like protest go strikes. Maybe would good time that. 

Canada instead double whole kindness thing. Instead cops going parks kicking people’s drinks name preserving law, handing masks politely suggesting distancing people close. installing port-a-potties throughout parks account immense demand, parks literally place go gets sunny. Right police versus citizens, never work like that. 

As hotel stay, seems like political theater, like curfew. mandates increase density people areas. curfew, three months Quebec (it must working great!), grocery stores getting absolutely packed around closing time people rush buy things work. Every essential store I’ve absolutely jammed. Apparently hotels filling up. would put people shared massive building instead let quarantine home? Quarantine sucks ass, would want stuck small hotel bedroom? fuck? 

Why government feel inflict much frustration citizens? name beating Covid unity? must better way. Like getting vaccines improving infrastructure (including healthcare system). definitely sounds possible factors well. Thanks info! know, knew American even mentioned CNN. masks take away freedom bro? Try look science rather going religious nonsense. cares cases hospitalizations dropping?? Travel want, wear mask care others. Go restaurant vaccinated friends stick maintain distancing better yet, outside dining. nothing? I’ve started things friends since vaccinated, it’s going walks sitting fire pit yard. That’s plenty fun safer crowd indoors. 100% safe giving people illusion important feasible. People need get it. feel unsafe basic human activities used you’ve vaccinated that’s you. “think _____!”. excuse doesn’t work anymore. worried take precautions health everyone else’s responsibility despite year shoved everyone’s throats consider specific situation might exceptional. 

Of course. that's exactly problem. (society) way accurately precisely know (ahead time) mild severe case SARS-Cov2 might person person. 

We simply yet know enough deeper inner-workings virus. (we may one day.. currently not). 

So,. asymptomic-carrier (you're infected (and know it) really showing signs).. mingle random grouping people,.. many people might inadvertently end killing?.. 

We currently way predict that. 

So face unknown.. better take precautions like wearing mask social distancing getting vaccinated ?

Those seem like pretty easy simple things expect people do.. collectively contributing helping reduce pandemic. 'everyone dies'. Since COVID start 100% death rate? simian adenovirus

Who designed vaccine, Wile E. Coyote? make boss money home. comfortable sweats. 

It's control. Wasn’t time, that’s god intended it. contrary, doesn’t change data. take CNN’s BS total cases deaths get percentage, it’s 1% death. stupid sounding bro completely agree getting doses needs happen, lot red tape way need get cut. could wrong, think India approved J&amp;J vaccine yet. Also, remember reading legal reasons US send AZ doses dance around calling ""loans"" give away doses did. Prior pandemic, well generation kids large amount smoking, drugs, drinking, compared past generations

Source? skeptical claim.

It true smoking, different alcohol/other recreational drugs, probably least associated partying. anyone actually think make significant difference point? 33 ready go concerts think 60 minutes political hit machine, probably question things life. didn't, though. missed targets significant margins turned opportunities buy wanted wait proved effective... exact opposite goal buying proved effective. bunch seniors returned winter in.... Florida. supposed get first shot today canceled. really don’t want pay total $80 7 minute Uber ride back. appointments university since stopped using J&amp;J looks like imma wait May get vaccinated. 😔 got second Pfizer shot Thursday. Spent yesterday feeling really fatigued achy, feel totally normal today, except mild arm soreness. Everyone dismisses 99% survival rate. realize multiple don’t survive develop kinds unpleasant complications. get hospitalized survive still shed decades life expectancy. 1% chance dying, probably closer 5% chance crippled. 😂😂😂 try telling families millions died time. can't like state either: Florida middle pack Eh, it’s easily controversial state numbers wise government keeps getting caught fucking numbers. 

I don’t know anyone knows truth Florida numbers longer.  They’re effectively meaningless. protect variants, living rock? Many studies done already.

One example new york varibte E484 Mutation like SA always question endgame people like you? Testing, masking distancing forever end time? People nit meant live like that. ...Welp. I’m fully vaccinated great motivator stay (maybe even increase) vitamin supplements focus nutrition general. Godspeed us all. Obviously stinks everyone impacted, sort good know monitoring sorts things addressed. reason family can't get vaccinated? get downvoted hard this? got second shot wrecked yesterday low grade fever flu symptoms. would suck vacation. I’m fully aware young, healthy adults likely die catch covid. pass others. serve reservoir. claim expertise all, I’ve read several articles epidemiologists raising concerns keeping covid circulating high level make new variants likely. affected themselves, sure, want. affects us people don’t take precautions.  No. fully vaccinated travel, go restaurants whatever legal. people will, too. I've done duty, got vaccinated, nothing wait for. Chinese vaccine, recall EU announcing vaccine validated EMA would accepted. think Chinese vaccine makers submitted request validation yet. It’s almost may reasonable middle ground here? you’re vaccinated young person, it’s probably irresponsible go back living life 100% pre-pandemic fashion, may reasonable resume higher-risk activities provide value life. Maybe don’t go bar that’s packed gills, won’t fault drink somewhere relatively uncrowded. true, lot people still vit deficiency either ignorance laziness. narrow view people hold sort social stigma towards STIs antiquated biased.

So common belief ""people intentionally go try get STIs""... ? I'm pretty sure not. ""The stigma getting something like Gonorrhea dissipated among younger generations, prevailing consensus people right decide risk aversion strategies.""

Well.. would explain Gonorrhea cases 82% since 2009. ""In 2018, total 583,405 cases gonorrhea reported United States, yielding rate 179.1 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 14, Table 1). 2017–2018, rate reported gonorrhea cases increased 5.0%, increased 82.6% since historic low ""For COVID, really think sort social stigma regarding people decided reclaim lives?""

Yes. do. see everyday outside. ""In reality negative stigma towards people think restrictions continue forever,""

No sensible person thinks ""restrictions FOREVER"". think Restrictions based rational science data-driven numbers (reflective new-infections ""That going change, matter much try shame people.""

I'm ""trying shame people"". I'm pointing objective facts. individual ""going go party, damned anything else"".. weeks month later friends family members die.. person STILL change behavior continues behave unsafely,. think logical conclude person care people die. 

The hard truth is:.. community society cannot survive everyone dies. There's way around fact. communicable disease spreading community,.. stop it. Anything less saying ""We care people die slow horrible (preventable) death."" variant. cousin 48 went South America last month visit sick brother ended dying covid. likely p1 variant dominant strain. regular covid summer beat ease based vax experience here, doubt it. Canada buys dosages doesn’t equal jabs arms. 

Because thirteen seperate governments deciding exact job, roll slow inconsistent. 

I’ll believe see two eyes would employ thousands thousands people. Thousands employees one thing once. idea would ""too busy working something"" almost adorable childlike is. speculation another thread Brazil's higher rates may partially due factors lower MMR vaccine uptake prevalence Zika virus. know enough either speculate, welcome additional information others. Mistake title - say 'New Cases' Smh rip 😥. South America getting hit hard too. sad thing people acting like thing  Unfortunately fly US, drive back Canada. Northern Exposure filmed outside Seattle, Washington. fail still probably achieved one hell lot good. 

Spoken someone clearly hasn’t played “hearts” :) haven’t drink 8 weeks noticed drinking much didn’t want become problem Thought exact thing AZ got caught lying efficacy results recently. ended difference percent remember right, damn watchdog group catch publicly call it. CDC top it. vaccinated guys hanging unvaccinated folks? started unmasked feels weird lol definitely take getting used Yup! Messaging overly cautious. play devil's advocate, blood clotting issue J&amp;J vaccine found week. people might prefer wait see bit longer taking whichever vaccine seems safest (likely Pfizer/Moderna). We're talking vaccines virus itself. anything, Vitamin give even stronger reaction vaccine since immune system propped  ever going stamp out... plunge aggressively wearing masks... predicted towards start pandemic, would eventually level hit places same. It’s kind depressing actually happened though. makes feel like almost pointless. know wasn’t individual level, especially early important slow curve. really seems like basically everyone going get it, eventually got it. sort opposite. First dose hurt usual injection hurts going in, almost felt hot injected, required bandaid (very minor) bleeding. 

Second dose didn’t even realize received already done. bleeding, band-aid.

Two different pharmacists sitting/standing two different angles arm. I’m nearly certain it’s difference administrators thing. Entire civilizations wiped name religion. People risking infection virus low single digit mortality rate nothing comparison. That's behind paywall. 

But [the FDA's * Visit fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks physical * Visit unvaccinated people single household low risk severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks physical distancing....

I'm leaving though Pakistan, standard policy admit anyone O2 sat 80. There's huge shortage hospital beds developing world. 

An O2 90 used enough get admitted PICU(although also certain symptoms like tachypnea, symptomless 89 O2 sat never enough warrant PICU admission least Canada) seen many covid patients routinely much lower O2 sats possible. 

You ration ventilators PICU space like crazy, even patients turn away still running 100% capacity. look times adjust accordingly, admit everyone 86 O2 sat, stuck bunch likely-to-survive-without-medical-help patients ones can't survive without medical assistance get turned away die.

Ireland? booked like probably close 50-70 appointments friends family family friends definitely addicted while. Haven’t looking week two though I’m That’s straightforward reasoning think counter would be: don’t risk people get vaccine then? access right? vaccine works need extra step vaccinated millions people may want it? Same. ready. Strictly speaking, *no*. Deaths highly concentrated older people. young, cases potentially suffering lasting damage, far less likely hurt. every state strong trend towards opening things back up. may see many states retain mask mandates, mask mandates less impact economic life places shut half-shut.

But vaccinating young adults extremely wise highly doubt we'll regret effort so. new variants seem deadly individual basis original strain seem transmittable, seeing high transmission among younger persons. causes measure health damage, young persons unlucky enough impacted well unvaccinated older people younger people essentially vehicle transmission.

Moreover, whether consider rational not, large population vaccinated people cautious getting fully back prior economic social life. time; crazy year. high case numbers--even deaths continue decline--can spook keep bit inside bit longer. matter social policy much aggregate individual behavior.

TLDR: Re-opening happening, mask mandates may linger, lets vaccinate whippersnappers. Sure, many totally preventable many second doses enough firsts. mean got pulled lol?

As summer approaches still third wave(I think), become harder harder anything. Even last year ate restaurants patios, seems that’s what’s cards year. need get vaccinated ASAP reach called “herd immunity.” “herd immunity” tested way? states refuse let flights MI land. 

Pretty sure states standing interfere interstate commerce like that. 69.420% 6/9!

Nice! Children still vectors infecting older populations. don’t really think there’s wrong approach, continuity argument protecting leaders stability valid, making point waiting turn also good makes people feel like they’re together. Still word efficacy though? anybody else sub (from US) vaguely addicted looking vaccine appointments? already got #1 scheduled #2, can't look VAMS, CVS, etc. . . Agree. read quote posted somewhere don’t necessarily agree wanted see people think even signature.

Easily remedied. Needs happen point mean plenty sporting events around world going ahead. likely need happens sans audience. Simple statistics says patriotic duty get another shot tomorrow. point public allowed choose level risk?

No.

If someone's actions *only* affected themselves, yes, could fair argument approach. That's case though. People going way safe still infected people give fuck, chances high enough ""real"" speak. Even going further, things worst winter, especially awful people filling hospital space treatment: meant people, even people without Covid19, unable treated.

Person everything right pandemic die anyway, got accident room hospital person B went mask burning parties got sick.

""Let decide"" really dumb dangerous approach situation strong coincidence risk individuals. go away please? adults talking. country poor vaccination roll-out? fatality rate ""young adults"" low enough line diseases we've us forever. I’m always game COVID headline bingo!

I’d love intelligent conversation headlines written edited. doesn’t seem place that. team goody two shoes way kids supposed meekly watch tv sit miserable.  I’m fully vaccinated today. 

I’m healthy, 29 year old, white collar worker. pandemic much less serious months ago. 

I feel liberated. Another conspiracy theory: countries agreements Pfizer Moderna ones liable side effects caused - opposite true AZ (only USA) J&amp;J. cases countries would liable, pay attention. stupid theory still better assuming supress media, lol. link this? couldn’t find anything. Speak north. Miami still mask mandate curfew lifted *this week*. measure vaccine efficacy.

To measure vaccine efficacy, need measure proportion positive cases vaccinated group control group. Yep, issue natural birth unpredictable takes lot staff time. Cesarean delivery fixed time span staff involvement. guess one doctors prefer. measure vaccine efficacy.

To measure vaccine efficacy, need measure proportion positive cases vaccinated group control group. measure vaccine efficacy.

To measure vaccine efficacy, need measure proportion positive cases vaccinated group control group.  Massively underreported + young population. drunk power give without fight. Except no, that’s measure vaccine efficacy.

Vaccine efficacy proportion positive cases vaccinated group control group. cannot determine efficacy using vaccinated group. agree, unfortunately way many people Ontario seem want continue Wdym doctor vaccine center? mean? trying discredit anything curious Swedens death rate par average Europe, thats without lockdowns. really terrible. Yeah. ""Oh yeah show official papers baby"" countries prioritizing vaccinating front-line workers, vulnerable elderly first athletes limited vaccine supply.

Guess took pandemic find people really important. athlete one them. probably come Europe

definitely coming Europe. would stupidity rely US allow vaccines come there. personally three weeks first shot. link? don’t doubt I’d like see safe outdoor dining / bars? AstraZeneca loose PR war. lost confidence false claims production totally embarrassing roll out... 

AstraZeneca promised Q1 120 mil doses EU delivered less 30 mil. Q2 planned 180 mil. EU happy even 120 mil. Q1 delivered till end June. Anyone side effects Pfizer including low appetite super picky finicky appetite ? long last? Yeah, shit-filled lambskin condom president Mexico supposedly first dose Tuesday live TV. ICU patients 39 elders currently, different compared last year. Despite lockdown, state given minimal help people need huge amount people ignored state sadly risking lives daily NEED work, tough situation early vaccines significant effect yet, hence cases still high now. Many people got sick shots 1-2 trials. I’d wait *at least* 3 week mark first shot, that’s lines graph really split apart antibodies kicked in. week 2-3 double. (But personally I’m waiting I’m two weeks second. It’s year, another two weeks won’t kill me.) depends think necessary reopening country, true herd immunity thresholds disease (still matter debate).

If believe herd immunity 80%+, can't get without kids, largely due pockets strong vaccine hesitancy adults e.g. Republicans younger adults. again, might think herd immunity necessary permanent reopening. Maybe certain daily death rate sufficient, without herd immunity.

So, really depends much COVID we're willing tolerate. realize likely won’t happen due antimaskers health conditions may prevent people getting shot right? still can’t even go testing center unless certain symptoms close contact someone tested positive. Recently handful private companies begun selling mail tests $130-400 pop, aren’t required report results government Tokyo opening ceremonies going aired live morning. usually 3rd world countries trials...less volunteering exercise usually financial survival. grateful naive.

Personally support vaccines concerning covid i'm sure data exists serious threat age group covid warrants trials mrna vaccines, honest showing unpredicted side effects. That’s straightforward reasoning think counter would be: don’t risk people get vaccine then?

It's taken 14 months people's brains barely *start* churning incredibly difficult piece logic Whose favorite memory college class ?😂 I'd venture say almost none  Honestly, double vaccinated would even consider going somewhere indoors without mask requirements unless required proof vaccine. won’t feel comfortable around unvaccinated people unmasked 1% positivity lower. Depends, $20k 3 days. Yeah make long drive first appointment Ya mean people 2 weeks beyond first shot. Mix fully vaccinated. I’ve read moderna get near full efficacy 2 weeks there’s ton clearness True started vaccinating 12th, vaccinated 1139 first day that's Miami averaging cases (51) NYC (36) per 100,000 residents. One six people COVID Miami vs one nine NYC. matter situation is, Ontarians role judge ones dare protest. communism (economic) implemented Canada, Ontarians would accept it. makes perfect sense. vaccines use essentially antigen.

Not entirely true. Astrazeneca vaccine uses essentially wild-type Spike protein, others use version called S-2P proline substitution, helps keep Spike protein pre-fusion conformation. state ended mandates ""blown up"" yet? Title edited wrong. noted article, vaccines give immunocompromised people hope need wait rest world vaccinated safe. Agree 💯 put lettuce burger bit real fruit lime liquor california administered 805k doses today (according [bloomberg fine, many side effects. curious, donate blood American Red Cross tell vaccine antibodies week later. Honestly, depends live. San Francisco case rates low they've ever been, basically, would feel comfortable fully vaccinated. feel comfortable e.g. Michigan case rates pretty high. Hi.

I've actually curious Russian statistics confirmed infections. Practically every country Europe wave epidemic caused UK variants. Russia seems that. peak Christmas, I'm assuming less infectious Wuhan strain still dominant time. E.g. Finland Estonia also peak around then, followed decline wave caused variants started February. where's Russia's third wave? number new cases really look like natural herd immunity yet. satistics reliable? virus samples sequenced? Thank contributing effort. doctor saw today said probably COVID, given history gastrointestinal issues known exposure COVID positive person. think make fair point, PCR test come back Monday wait schedule it. Like said, get open time.  idea No. Serious side effects guarantee, there's nothing worry about. Encourage getting vaccine? 100% absolutely yes.

Continuing restrictions life livelihoods? 100% absolutely no. I’ve long cold Finally elder neighbor told me: "" get shot asshole Merkel get vaccine"" (in german) get vaccine. Sure can. We, society, mandate people things constantly greater good. It’s called rule law. Even did, comment sections sub always same. Reddit ready understand absolute x relative risks, vaccine efficacy measured relatively (placebo x vaccinated)... live big city vaccine appointments getting easier easier schedule. would wait make sure COVID, reschedule weeks.

But reason think would hard make another appointment yourself, risk able get appointment.

I guess depends likely think COVID? in, known exposure COVID positive person? hate nationalism made/makes many people hate kill people. see nationalism disease, rot mind, something blocks one seeing true ugliness nation, makes terrible things country. hate it, I'm done it. 


Why proud America havent given greencard living 90% life? Big Pharma already plans booster shots, want keep profits incoming long possible. requires virus mutate cross species barrier, infectious enough spread far enough matter, severe enough matter.

A pandemic disease needs ""sweet spot"" infectious enough infect millions quickly also severe enough matter, shut economy common cold nowhere near severe covid.

It's rare event, even excluding first requirement taking human diseases mutating.  place taken - Sao Paulo, Brazil - experiencing worst COVID infection rate right - hospital system broken...supply chain cut off...and nowhere bury dead. using grid method now; insane.

J&amp;J official says unusual blood clot event reported vaccine trial

From CNN's Jacqueline Howard

At least one vaccine trial volunteer also developed unusual blood clots getting Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, top official company said Wednesday. 

Dr. Aran Maree, chief medical officer J&amp;J’s vaccine arm Janssen, said blood clots seen two patients Phase 3 vaccine trials – one got vaccine one given placebo shot. 

Maree also detailed seventh possible case emergency meeting US Centers Disease Control Prevention's Advisory Committee Immunization Practices.

There one case concerning type blood clot, known cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), September, Phase 3 trial single-dose vaccine, Maree said. involved 25-year-old white man recovered. Plus, 59-year-old woman developed series blood clots known deep vein thromboses DVTs. 

The company looking possible cases, Maree said.

""There also ongoing study, large open label study, South African health care professionals. enrolled currently, 272,438 participants,"" Maree said. ""We reports CVST. one case pulmonary embolism.""

A pulmonary embolism blood clot lung.”[vaccine updates devastated new restrictions Ontario. likely destroyed summer plans. Anyone else boat? want :'( Highly unlikely, zero % chance. Sure, get away without wearing mask government confident getting everybody updated new vaccine shot every combat new variants. Otherwise, chances someone get hit new variant he/she might life long neurological issue result. personally, would wear masks even vaccinated risk worth it. Theoretically sure. Practically extremely unlikely. 

I would worry it. Starting understand 1920s! humans good taking care future selves, one would ever get hangover.  Hospitalizations Florida right though overall. cohort, trending (12% 14 day rolling average). young people occupying beds now. essentially US

I'll fully vaxxed Monday expect go back normal life without masks next month two closest state Florida vaccinating without proof residency social security? (I want take flight US get vaccinated) absolutely not. relief much time I’m annoyed people want talk around, leave alone ugh. Everyone days seems think it’s ok strike convos strangers lonely think everyone around chat. God, it’s much better beginning people still really tried social distance kept themselves. Also top off, please tell death rate is, since you’re smart use science. Sure can, pinch, I'm sure people us can. Thanks! That’s I’m from, great state. :) Bro, incorrect one, [they fucked around [doubled called it. think he's sueing them... covid-19 virus? not, saying ""we""? agree this..recklessly trying recapture/reclaim lost yr..reality harsh though I'm epidemiologist, able find study *exactly* compares efficacy vaccine someone previously infected vs previously infected. ROCK/BAND it’s lmao don’t need tons excess deaths know obviously good deal virus moving population. That’s good thing you’re trying host Olympics. 32 miss concerts :( One thing one talks about, switched vaping barely smoke now. used smoke whole cig got urges, even multiple packs week bad, might take 1 tiny puff vape pen, sometimes dont even that. Great news old people, hospitalizations Florida overall right now. 12% 14 day rolling average.  Looks like true younger crowd getting impacted worse now. Surely fringe viewpoint. I’m older millennial even nerd people know don’t watch anime less never have."
