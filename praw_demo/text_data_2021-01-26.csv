0,2021-01-26," speak myself, I’m much concerned speed vaccines actually administered. many doses like, aren’t getting put arms doesn’t really matter. Here’s hoping prediction accurate though! January always deadliest month. January 13th usually deadliest day year. Well interview states EU production 3 months behind UKs due later signing contract. Since UK clearly production issues late December, AZ shouldve informed EU Q1 delivery schedule EU claims agreed could possibly met. best effort wouldve inform EU that, instead mentioned hickups early december shitshow dropped Friday. least that's EU version.   thoughts exactly imagine big switch vaccine supply outpaces demand. low risk individual schedule time get shot leisure, mask wearing decline rapidly. go away entirely places like public transportation crowded areas, see lot less vaccine becomes widley distributed.

&amp;#x200B;

Scientifically, may early want optimally reduce risk, socially, think people willing wear masks consistently come widespread vaccination. Yes, noticed emergency going on.

All vaccines approved 'emergency use' - that's vaccines rather wait years. almost AZ vaccines produced EU CEO said. four main production facilities Belgium, Netherlands, Germany Italy Well good thing buy 52 million doses this... great job Canada /s report it. mods anything though, busy cherrypicking ""incivility"" ""keep information high quality"" comments... course are!

It’s anyone’s safety...

It’s kids keeping parents home create value marginally compensated... Literally everything open Florida. rural areas either, big cities like MIA, FTL, WPB. still wear mask stores, restaurants, etc; people go crazy wearing properly wearing one like beginning corona. Government agencies like DMV/tax collector ""appointment only"" different before, actually makes function better. least find supplies need stores (that is...until next big news story scawy virus gets propagated masses).

Is ""normal"" still see people driving around alone car wearing mask like idiot? No. heck lot normal states still businesses shutdown. clubs, bars, etc. back open along public areas like beach. read tweet highly educated epidemiologist wondering long could live without hot water didn’t want anybody house.

People vastly overestimated risks covid. Take look dataset see mean. People age forty think chance dying covid. like 1000x Schools ignoring it. parents threatening, harassing, practically storming schools, demanding ~~free babysitting~~ education kids are. new variants going around, suspect we're going see flare long, vaccination suppression aside. argument I'm surprised happened earlier, honest.

There lot people believe vaccine part conspiracy, lot traditional terrorist groups must getting pretty desperate right now. Islamic State, example, starved attention crave much.

For anyone wanted cause general mayhem, vaccine production plant would obvious target. Distribution seems done incredibly haphazardly throughout country. laws got theirs, ended waiting hour crowded waiting room. I'm shocked get COVID waiting.

Having risk people forming line *maybe* get vaccine cruel. hospitals EMRs, invest notification systems lottery virtually. Huh? agree this. I'm saying would take another year half 2 years would become endemic. still pretty far herd immunity world. recurrent vaccination largely stopped countries program. never done judged worth time money. endemic Corona virus worse common cold almost equivalent gone. unimportant inconsequential material sense world. minor nuisance that's friend knows professionally. known “Dr. Doom” even covid. Besides right wrong, come appears now? mean, months ago know deliver 1/4 vaccines, didnt tell anyone EU reacted now? don’t know havnt entered global recession yet. local family owned. I’ve worked many restaurant corporate jobs worst. U.K. country regularly sequence COVID-19 genome infected people. variant might British like Spanish Flu Spanish.  state doesn't. I'm required mask get mail take dog out. neighbors sight. long wear mask way table bar order chips, sit drink hours. rules inconsistent ineffectual. Ok space two comments position shifted “lockdowns prevent hospital overruns” “lockdowns must continue herd immunity regardless many people dying.” Pfizer ship 120M dozes end March, another 80m end May. Moderna, 100M end March, 100m end June. takes 5-6 weeks achieve full protection vaccination (1st+second dose + two weeks), **if** schedules hold, **if** there's long significant delay vaccines shipping going peoples' arms, end May see somewhere around 100m-150m adults US fully inoculated. Potentially several 10's millions J&amp;J vaccine comes manufacturing finally ramps up. district told us collecting data students staff covid infections. contact tracers nurses building 1-2x week.
We also move desks 6.5 feet close contact. know, first graders stay 6.5 feet away one another. 2025 come US actually seeing us well watching countries lose shit refreshing change. 

Unfortunately doubt last long. Teachers views seem different across country. mother teaches middle school, teachers excited go back except maybe 2-3 throughout entire district. back school teaching 5 days week since august, 0 cases spread school. Well, think reconsider thought process think going go away. happen become endemic instead 4 Coronavirus running around 5. enough immunity like regular respiratory cold virus infect people. nearly deadly people still die like people die colds past. maybe people need stop comparing things absolutely nothing *whatsoever* other.

Once again, two words even sentence unless correcting people ignorant viruses....which exactly did.  “They right!
We don’t care!

End story!”

To good neighborhood! Novasep first CDMO AZ contracted AZ vaccine production (way EU even signed contract). AZ enough time get production Novasep sorted out. Thanks Biden... thought gonna change course Vietnam deserves way recognition island countries actually put work (provided numbers accurate - harder tell third world countries accurate things are) mean visited already parties. everything open numbers better worse anywhere else. agree. Cases lot states (including mine CA) starting drop quickly. Hopefully we're side winter wave. 

That + vaccines rolling might finally put ""end"" pandemic sooner people think. 

What mean ""end"" though is... cases getting low much population vaccinated businesses operations across many sectors begin reopening/functioning almost pre-pandemic levels. ultimately squabble really fact US UK likely paid substantially vaccines ahead line. EU paid less therefore back line regretting fact. proven yet seems highly likely. time tell sure UK contract irrelevant EU contract PoV. fact AZ claims EU production 3 months behind UK hence couldve known possible delay informed EU much earlier. least early January. complete fuckup AZs side seem want stir politics UK EU rather admit fault. We're going back school next week shit dumbest restrictions I've heard life. We're going divided 3 groups, one different class teacher somehow manage help group. teacher lecturing one room group two groups watch online (????). Limited movement well, excited finally go back I'm not. saying easier - still put work - dude, moving goalposts. 

Remember started ""two weeks slow spread"" approaching year lockdowns nothing show it.

They've changed amount people required get vaccinated achieve herd immunity return normal many times point. actually think it’s ethically sound person taking risk person paid so. 

What don’t think ethically sound employers decide pay them, choosing curbside vs going doesn’t affect they’re paid. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ding ding! EU vaccines right  they’re using , reason blaming AZ/U.K. helps keep member states bay.... now. ""But could long term effects!""

*while eat processed food, rarely work out, completely ignore possible long term effects COVID*

Yeah, perhaps y'all worry longterm effects everday habits much worry vaccine's safety, Ill actually respect view point, youre taking care body, quit fucking hypocrite. guess lock 2022 save lives?  COVID becomes mild due vaccination, reason lock down? like lock anything else, like influenza (which usually also mild). EU arguably right irrelevant. driver's seat vaccine. End story surprised EU ends getting AZ rate going. likely sent leftover stocks Novavax JNJ US UK around April so. 

Lol no. There's contracts, EU bought much doses US UK. Also, ""leftovers""? J&amp;J produced Europe. US bad testing various strains. B117 explains huge surge winter. got control several states. would correct... Old people vaccinated enough. 

If wanted to, could easily find information vaccine herd immunity % population need vaccinated common spread neutralized.

I'll give hint... required % vaccinated ""old people"". nose swab even bad I've done 3 times endoscopy/colonoscopy type joke somewhere... Plastic straws oceans sucks used argument use CDC pesky teenagers drunk guys 3am always mooning others first line! EU demanded concurrence British deliveries despite taking 3 months longer sign contract. 

As result, got weaker commitment. Reeeeeeeeee college kids locked year even risk partying. know could kill Grandma? vaccines 95% effective all. saves one life worth it. ""The *crackdown* comes year virus began spreading rapidly country."" Can't make shit like dance drink high end clubs. suppose ashamed that? trying make empathy empathy people like yourself. correct, give shit anymore. form parties would vote remove EU believe vote parties let thing. fact expect movements already exist grow substantially. one reason school helps. Keeping kids supervised space helps whole community. Also reason teachers teaching remotely catching covid higher rate school. Actually school makes socializing much keep mask hands washed. would unironically prefer anal swab. nose thing freaks out. be!?!?? seriously fucking shit. racketeer citizens going work near poverty wage 100 year pandemic don’t give supplemental financial assistance making sacrifice staying home sick kids need watch parents shoveling kids school cause need go work schools can’t say anything cause need send kid home house parent cause can’t afford time cause don’t savings.

Simply put, fucked poor wages devaluing 40 hours, fuck poor attaching health care job pays shit leverage healthcare provide, fuck poor giving supplemental pay encourage people stay home sick, fuck poor get sick need treatment deductible stupid $3,000 gets covered 1/10 years earning people working $15 dollars hour aren’t poverty officially. Yeah heard right. “Many unions touting study”

Ah, well, unions saying take long mods close new comments, 😎  problem ""abstinence only"" style COVID messaging governments pursuring. Vaccines panacea, they're hell lot better vaccinated. hard explain people ""yes, lot more, also act like things 100% back normal"" messaging all-or-nothing. Okay, I'll bite, there?  Soon mandated CCP, CCP bots sub teeming say stupid West anal swabs Apparently word “sooner” replacement allowed sub... people eagerly anticipate advertise condition rhymes “room.” think majority people understand bad violence could get. live Chicago worked company boarding South West sides. Many, many storefronts ""mini malls"" burned looted. Continued lock downs government financial help would dangerous. [The State Virus: Cases Begin haha omg 

you mind teacher. trying recover Covid speak school can't follow basic rules.

They away 6' rule students classrooms school. families choosing virtual think crowding issue.

However, counseling beginning year overcrowded rosters like 40+ kids per class could avoid hiring new staff. knew kids would choose virtual figured we'd never get fill classes year anyway. teachers get sick quit, double classes.

So ended several classes kids wall wall usual.

And enforce proper mask wearing everyone goes around nose hanging out.

So sit, Covid, trying get better lot lingering symptoms. 

Oh rule go back work ONE DAY last symptoms 10 days diagnosis minimum. Monday I'll start proving I'd still symptoms somehow. part bit unclear. delivery lets pay someone else take risk you. you’re high risk old, kind get it, otherwise? Made mistake wearing two masks driving work alone car. watched hundreds poor grandmas dropped dead drove past windows up. 


5 mask mandates ITT: people idea contract works.

The date EU signed contract relevant. There's queue get vaccines. EU paid AZ produce doses EU EU market. Yes delays expected, that's problem itself. also no, AZ gonna pull contract mad EU, middle school.  media needs stop grocery panic bs. I'm tired panic buying. know curbside/online shopping. Every time report another grocery story people panic! want able buy normal groceries without deal empty shelves. cousin, still can't believe passed. much RIP hope company producing vaccine cost charge 500-850% less alternatives thugs EU took forever order. even approved yet.

Also, irony calling people stupid eating false story. think Onion laugh. forgotten 90s? left said evil apparently stole money somehow also sharing anyone. keeping himself. wait see sub freaking spring break pictures Florida Scomo resisted lockdown states said going anyway.

Once became clear avoid dealing pandemic, he's done decent job. basically, rural, life normal, minus people dying.

If urban, life either taking pandemic seriously, thwarting taking pandemic seriously, dying people (which could way worse). going correlation restrictions death rate NY times vaccine ""best effort"" compel company break existing legal contracts. best effort *within law*. need stimulus UBI.

So people afford STAY FUCK HOME.

And needing send kids state sponsored daycare bring home covid barely getting people basic masks... complicating lead many simply wearing masks all. Instead adding fear stress already overwhelming situation, need simply distribute better masks mandate usage. Yes, everyone still makes shitty move. Brings us back article. didn’t control. reporting 41 cases thousands day. Everyone first lockdown successfully/get numbers low it’s sustainable. (unless guess wealthy) everyone knew re-opening would cause numbers rise never stopping virus overwhelm hospitals. Schools obeying law harming students? Surely not! way hold (probably white, guessin - disregard replace corrupt lol) people responsible... Anyone else american country much vaccinate people? makes happy sad time see americans/canadiands/british people say life get back normal spring summer cause 70% vaccinated, live México president barely putting effort vaccinating people, we've less 700k people vaccinated, pfizer stopped delivering vaccines mid-february, supposed get around 27M doses Sputnik V vaccine approved anywhere far unknown works older people. 
I'm tired this, reaching death records every day things seem get better, lot people say keep living fear stay home another 2 years vaccination ramp up. Vaccines get rid virus, get cases manageable levels. Considering Australia going zero cases, essentially stuck bubble forever, rest world learns live virus. suggest tell learn economics. suggest would nothing left reopen. also need social scientists involved public health policy going forward. Psychologists, sociologists, etc. help form public policy balances human needs &amp; behaviors mitigation measures. Abstinence-only never worked going work now. student (age 4) exposed covid weekend. found next Friday exposed let know right away. parent symptoms. child fever weekend. doctor tested parent (positive) declined test child, said assume child positive. child extremely close contact age. school told me, ""Since confirmed positive quarantine."" 

So. Awesome. Glad got go back expose entire classroom young children. Anecdotally totally false. laws got covid nephew caught another kid daycare. I’m led believe always plan. made AZ facilities Netherlands Belgium. Eu funded novasep facility lot people seem really surprised deal children decided have. 😤

I tell one way changed sleep. awful anxiety dreams I'm public walking around normal stuff realize I'm wearing mask one else either.... immediately feel panicked start looking around trying figure usually end trying get home wake feeling distressed sort.

I probably woken way least five times.

😷 Thank 👏 could've shut borders earlier introduced measures curb virus already country. quarantine measures place new arrivals could joining New Zealand, also island nation, virus free. 

While blame entirely government *now* certainly initial response. think people legitimately get they're supposed find difficult work around find totally believable visitors family members come would say stuff exactly level we'd kinda sit like... Well could obvious XYZ. stuff obvious US though. 

Also nurse worker pandemic hospital prior. That's experience have. We'd deal interesting family members. 

Oh confused clammy suddenly? check blood sugar? diabetic... 

Shit like that. IRVINE, Calif. -- health care worker died UC Irvine Medical Center receiving second dose Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine, Orange County Register reported Zook, 60-year-old X-ray technologist South Coast Global Medical Center Santa Ana, suffered adverse reaction within hours second shot administered, according newspaper. doom mongering train, several coworkers mine, PhDs less, saying need remain locked every child age 12 also vaccinated take 2022 vaccines approved yet. course ignoring population zero risk COVID.

I'm sure trying argue, objective data support correlation specific type mobility we're discussing Covid cases. Ugh that’s worst. feel like whole thing made neighborhood unfriendly hostile. people can't bubbled rest society, population enough people overrun hospital system spreads unchecked. Also lots lots people dying bad thing. blog company sells online products? fucking joke. even posted here. evidence vaccines effective mutations yet understanding. 3,500 PS5s!!!!! He’s factoring incompetence Hcq plus zinc cures covid. Vaccines never put randomizes control trials. Registered PLC UK HQ Cambridge, UK.

The AZ vaccine developed Oxford University Britain (but lot EU funding...) That's... true. 400 got waste. I'm defending government vaccination happening normally. 
Source: couple relatives got tend agree. Enough enough. economic effect trudeau’s incompetence gonna hurt Canada long long time Absolutely always access ppe need jobs. However, many healthcare workers well way 2nd vaccination (and gotten it), many vulnerable people. moves forward, need high amounts ppe required raging pandemic vaccination, staff members increasingly immune hospitals seeing less overload. meantime, rest us need access better masks wait months vaccination opportunity. type stuff worries me. someone lot friends kids daycare-aged, know really different idea safety procedures state reality. Coming someone works daycare knows others work nearby daycares...Just state says done, mean is. Many rules feasible. Masks two year olds? best can, kids faces much. can't keep shoes on. Masks? LOL.  can't maintain separate bathrooms child needs potty train two toilets, put kid whatever's available. Washing toys every use? impossible kids jumping toy toy warped speed. keeping things washed cleaning supplies available spring? ration. that's tip iceberg. I’ll never forget self important guy passing us bike bikes pointing buff saying sing song voice “covid peaaaakkinnnngg!” I’m like yes uh huh sure it’s definitely peaking passing someone outside 15mph bike .... June/July ongoing summer camps running. worked mental health agency operates schools runs several alternative schools. was.. stressful One three French residents don’t believe vaccines safe. Ukraine Belarus worse even bothering pi k outline? know people going keeps mutating it’s possible. UK Gov choose AZ Oxford, Hancock reported rejected Merck lack written guarantees UK supply chains. It’s reported concerned Trump. always possible data set question asked: properly tracking important data? Even it’s problem. weren’t getting tested regularly, us never all. school dropped thousands cleaning supplies efforts keep us safe, gather one room daily 10-20 minutes, supervisors didn’t wear mask properly all, took formal complaint school change anything.

Meanwhile, every flu season almost close many us get sick aren’t enough adults run school. Yet somehow good idea.

The numbers 100% bullshit. kids can’t afford get cracked tooth fixed, hell would get tested COVID-19 even time means transportation privilege can’t afford? this? I'm Boston never wear mask outside. might get death stares TBH people masked might even know.  guy say he'd never take vaccine China? hates China Chinese vaccines? 

What this? headline *literally* says **above average.** people basically bot accounts repeating exact comments. Picked hell time start that, one year later getting progressively closer end pandemic. Mine says too, fine print states ""if can't distance others"". Ironic... *""Why visit Oklahoma!? Come South Dakota instead!"" (Paid S.D. Covid relief fund!)*  Remember goal flatten curve LOL  rush open schools ""save economy"" incredibly dangerous teachers front lines. anyone says safely worked public school. real. Canada ok spread Europe botched even harder U.S. severely lagging behind U.S. comes vaccinations. However hear “rah rah America bad gib money.” seem danger. seem capable reasoning listening sides arguments. Dialects,friend.  even think give take couple million will. experience, they're annoying distracting (I'm anti-mask, I've wearing masks even mandated area). think many people want continue past herd immunity, although I'll admit argument anecdotal. wife teacher school district saying parents pediatricians don’t recommend kids get tested bullshit..our pediatrician said kids tested. don’t test can’t get positive well don’t tell people someone positive could contact time complaining CEO's revelation ""best effort"" clause leak confidential information constitues breach contract. EU looking snatch vaccines well eh? Send mar lago pay guaranteed deliveries. misinformation thread, Jesus. Pure agenda. guarantee virus summer like many people think. Still need get billions people vaccinated  worldwide-an enormous undertaking-and assumes vaccines work mutations. People still need follow rules like mask wearing distancing, too.  Teeth? like tears severely fucked negotiations AZ. I'm CT teachers even begun vaccinated many schools kids going person year. mess. Thinking upend life turn dime company says can't work home kids suddenly home day problematic. Yes! need get rid whole ""phases"" nonsense 65+ vaccinated. state phases career complicated unnecessary: workers certain phase, communications sector, etc etc. open everyone stick willing arm! AZ diverted 'produced EU, **destined EU**' doses UK

Zero evidence that. quantitatively expressed mobile phone data. spatially assessed differentiated. thank much standing teachers country 330% teachers get covid compared general population. Teachers NEED GIVEN FREE n95 masks daily. Thats open schools. Biden step make n95s USA people protected. 

School simply safe. many kids come sick. wont impact kids much sure die? start charter voucher school !

the problem course enough teachers selfish enough make work Living pandemic doesn’t justify taking away jobs millions. That's negative tests used combination quarantining. Either quarantine travel test, test arrive quarantine afterwards.

This part places like Singapore NZ South Korea able keep case rates low. Manifestly has. EVERY single thread reddit dogpiled UK Brexiteers. EVERY SINGLE ONE. hilarious pathetically hung EU. next door neighbor (family 5) husband tested positive last Thursday 10th grade son still going school week can't miss high school baseball tryouts.  keep repeating doom gloom friends. get highest risk vaccinated panic subside public begin demand restrictions lifted, even gradually. anticipate needing mask probably summer, maybe even early fall, least situations think everything else back normal pretty fast get old people vaccinated. UK's order enabled AZ start production EU. EU purchase rights vaccines coming factories, even could applied retrospectively doses UK paid produced EU even signed agreement! one group much larger. vaccines given children. option quitting job stay home them. I'm guessing kids depend steady career. surprise me, though. wife teaches special needs kids can't/don't wear masks. NJ moved teachers list shots moved goalposts schools closing. treating teachers like glorified babysitters far that's working well Governors reelection. public hates teachers lazy bad guy closing schools. school also this. Like sitting class 80 minutes room 1950s ventilation 6'1 apart totally safe! Yes vaccinated dont see need mask that's requirement it. Well, thing came around time remdesivir hydrocloriquine rush, instead pushed pharma president given nation, indicated independent doctors. planning case studies different hospitals working months. really ""news"" Spain. results shown (similar vaccine companies start showing results) stokes gone first time. see different case Remdesivir etc. Completely agree!! People get influenza sometimes take 3 months recover this. 6 times worse influenza look death rates, surprise long-term sufferers. Especially since pneumonia. People get pneumonia couple weeks move life. Post downvoted people paid big pharma dismiss every news may implicate them. Billy, Don’t Hero
Bo Donaldson Heywoods

The marchin' band came along Main Street
The soldier blues fell behind
I looked across saw Billy
Waiting go join line
And head upon shoulder
His young lovely fiancee
From stood saw cryin'
And tears heard say

Billy, hero, fool life
Billy, hero, come back make wife
And started go said, Billy, keep head low
Billy, hero, come back me


The soldier blues trapped hillside
The battle raging around
The sergeant cried, We've got hang on, boys!
We've got hold piece ground
I need volunteer ride up
And bring us back extra men
And Billy's hand moment
Forgettin' words said

She said
Billy, hero, fool life
Billy, hero, come back make wife
And started go said, Billy, keep head low
Billy, hero, come back me

I heard fiancee got letter

That told Billy died day

The letter said hero

She proud died way

I heard threw letter away ... feel like I’m crazy world every time see people analyzing risk.

I going bit careful vaccine last days I’ve decided people telling fucking weirdos.

Show honest risk assessment I’ll consider it. Cant find one, I’ll go own:

95% effective

In 5% get it, 100% effective hospitalizations.

Don’t 100% chance getting COVID without vaccination risk lower still.

Got second Pfizer shot week ago, got tickets NHL game tomorrow night yesterday. Going go pick one new jerseys wear game... honestly don’t think I’ve excited something years. Well EU insisted AZ use French company, Novasep, scale production capacity Belgium. Yes, lot science showing good ventilation mitigates viral transmission — huge garage door half open breeze coming would allow good air exchange/dilution aerosols. I’m sure Google learn it. Ventilation important makes difference — feasible part house need retain heat. Teacher here. Schools may decent safety guidelines say following paper, goes schools! teachers students constantly break multiple guidelines throughout school day, placing others high risk. 

At site work at, see many classrooms go maskless, people constantly social distancing, wearing proper masks, washing hands leaving restroom, lying symptom self-reports, sitting next touching lunch recess... students teachers alike.

I can't stress enough: child attending school person capacity, SAFE. claim care child's health well all, need keep online learning right now! take answer whatever takes keep children school. 

Yes know online learning suck sometimes, know what's worse? Contracting spreading deadly virus could kill you, child, someone love, others. really worth risk compared year 2 online learning? mean disproportionately affected others. Lots companies see real drop sales since started, meanwhile people work service industry totally fucked ones going places eat people limited capacity (thank God).  sub cares grandparents ones dying Wow love censorship! celebrated it’s opinions disagree with! hell?  Save rhe lupus patients, fucking republican dipshits Wow, article Atlantic? They've pretty hysterical this. good read, make lot good truth thought going living way I’m living another 10 months,” the New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg tweeted about dour vaccine messaging, “I’d probably give completely.”

Me too, Michelle. too. 'China model world', 'why west keep complaining rights' legit pushing snake oil

It's actually worse this. Hydroxychloroquine snake oil. used treat lupus rheumatoid arthritis, patients get medication sudden demand. Article behind paywall, beliefe you.

He trustworthy person, all!
The whole trial PR around embarrassment. weird, advocate voluntary philanthropy alternative using tax dollars humanitarian things? problem common sentiment CDC report wasn’t hypothetical.  based actual observation actual schools, apparently possible follow guidelines degree sufficient get results CDC observed.

People cling *any* pushback science goes pre-held beliefs, whether true really, obesity rate (22% 2016) comparable European countries:  Let's hope not. paper trail exactly spread misinformation. least fReEdOm!¡!¡ temperature checks earlier. utterly useless. impression already this.

In US, not. wot spread happens people visiting people like houses explains lot it. lockdowns push people restaurants visiting friends houses. end amount spread longer period time. Additionally, one theory really buy may validity, everyone mixing together need lower percentage functionally get herd immunity even distribution virus among multiple populations. read comments video..... think articles remarking fact human protein, virus protein. wow.....only America....riot lost election stay silent f*d health care system is... Yes, said differnce France hardest lockdown ever far getting strict every ~3 weeks. people care anymore, fed up. still meet others home, always wear masks, etc. stores, bars etc can't open workers get wages gov without working it. makes work (like myself, doctor) fed up, since work often normal time feed short labour, time form recreation DAE America???? Applebee’s open NJ. One strict state lockdown wise. think places maybe large cities indoor dining banned. Probably booster every year two similar get flu shot every year covid booster advised every year two depending fast changes happen since pandemic turn endemic kid 1999, want party like 2019. People going wild make lost time

I however sense mask burning/Zoom deleting parties June, conceivable looser behavior restrictions could reverse downward trends temporarily.

So could transmissible variants taking over. 

I think likely outweigh factors vaccination, population immunity infection improving weather, can’t guarantee Phase 1 often small first time medicine administered humans. Usually healthy young males used purpose evaluate top line safety. I.e. serious complications. many children Europeans killed?
It’s best get emotional criticize Western countries done bad. least trying help lower income countries.

Edited add rest sentence hit “reply” fast. vaccines altered much quicker avoid safety trials since already passed them.

Yeah I'm sure seasons inversed New Zealand. specific method determine ""obviously"" untrue.

The line definitely exists, people, corporations, governments blurred time time again. process - even political, inefficient one - determine untrue, we're going trouble. *computation* (not actual experiment) considered effects air intake exhaust. i.e. assumed 0% purifier effectiveness. conclusion something moves air around also moves around droplets air.

Some friends work well lockdown setting, since they’re uncomfortable around people. 

On hand, longest year life. quite frankly, don’t know much longer go Think ways. turns EU supply send UK AstraZeneca meet ""supply contract"", also breach EU “best efforts” contract, considered gave away 4 million vaccines, means best give EU much possible. Even 4 million doses, more, still breach contract.

The question AstraZeneca actually used EU vaccines supply UK, did, could considered breach contract even “best efforts” contract.

Also, shady part AstraZeneca went *""all fine""*, oh able deliver **59 million** vaccines suddenly week approval. wanted understood. guarantee 70 percent Okies on-board purchase Show precedence EU nationalised assets.

Can explain mean, considering large areas US less wide open right now? Genuine question. Let's hope hope accurate expert analysis. u/James3680 get information took doses EU? 

 CEO ""The later deal EU meant processes three months behind. company train partners across Europe manufacture vaccine, “some people new process … know make vaccine they're efficient others,"" said.

For reason, most-efficient U.K. facility yields three times vaccine doses compared less-efficient factories elsewhere, facilities lowest yields supplying EU, according Soriot.""

Whereas UK started build iron processes.... three months ago. 
Nice shit post. 

I talking potential missed second doses, took head ass might considered possibility. Especially considering countries decided give first shots entire supply establish level immunity. 2 million, know get bunch still strongly encourage get vaccine. chance dying virus exponentially higher vaccine.  can't put teachers staff higher priority level (vaccine) wait couple weeks 2nd shot? mean seriously, know babysitting service school badly needed, infecting staff students way It. 
If CDC keen school reopen, better get staff vaccinated 1st. expected last Tuesday MLK catchup effect, explain yesterday barely higher last Monday (MLK day)? RemindMe! 5 months. Luckily district taking seriously send home. CNN calling end summer ""bold timeline"".

I mean, kinda vested interest ""supporting"" point, whether like not. long ago CNN normal, moderate news agency. point they've become conservative accused even weren't: another Fox News.    Thank you. Archive running slowly today. knows.

They know can't become infected someone carrying virus despite ill it. Plebs. N95 filters surgically implanted mainstem bronchi. I'm protected every virus known man known chimps. later contract 3rd party can't overrule that, would breach first contract.

All contracts independent (in case anyway). AZ signed two mutually exclusive contract terms two different parties entirely fault AZ. comment removed because

The UK ordered paid 100,000,000 AZ vaccines, EU signed anything AZ. who's vaccines again? lmao  can't U.S. this? accurate, needs done next. handicapped porta-a-potty individual worker go testing site. difficulty reading comprehension white privilege prevent understanding nuance exists? offended someone claims experience alot Moroccans dont identify Africa way countries Africa do?
 racism radar go felt need state obvious pretend world simple [online persona] political ideology is? teacher, albeit one Australia, isn’t purely US issue. problem Australia teachers leaving profession due ever decreasing conditions. I’m one them. 

Unfortunately, don’t see learning this. would take federal intervention strong willpower across board. Conditions declining decades. DECADES. 

The thing change society realizing education important. like use example trade delegation Japan coming Australia first thing asked was, “How education system. Talk us education.” states trade team went... “Uhhhhhh.” don’t talk education. It’s valued. 

When society values education pays teachers deserve provide working conditions deserve instead blaming teachers demeaning work, maybe we’ll see change. it’ll take reckoning.

Shitty planning Nowhere comment say anything hoping go major lockdown, kind gathering. said hopefully people safe. 

People keep saying ""we Covid fatigue"" ""we need freedom back"" ""I'm tired isolating"" reality, overwhelming majority Americans isolating quarantining several states absolutely restrictions cannot do.

Forget long term issues even younger people. went back check comment see user thought ha is! good writing reasonable stuff today, even nobody listening usual Tried hardest laugh EU financed vaccine

No didn't, 2016-2020 UK exclusively, first developed MARS vaccine. UK funded developement Covid-19 vaccine, UK funded construction two manufacturing plants ordered first 100,000,000 doses. 

3 months EU finally funded expansion two European plants tried declare vials vaccine theirs. Always been* finally exposed* main benefit n95 surgical mask, possible whole nose mask thing them. picked multiple agencies anyway. I'm saying they're going to, neither AZ Pfizer actually increase supplies EU ""acceptable"" level within Q1, EU two alternatives, take L ban exports Fair post, thing I'll add Victoria came intense Federal pressure reopen back late May subsequent events proved opened early, quarantine leaks notwithstanding.
The Federal Education Minister accused Andrews taking sledgehammer children's education tried bribe private schools open early, Federal MP's like Tim Wilson describing Andrews sort power trip, Morrison said live virus, outbreaks expected close occurred.
The Feds since changed tune, provided little support Victoria's second wave, quite opposite fact, bear least responsibility happening first place. Wtf going on

The EU wasted lot time desperately looking scapegoat. According CDC, 537 deaths 15–24 category. talking ~50 people numbers split evenly. going pretend immortality end goal? even taking account second order effects like suicides, *definitely* happening age group this. absolute nuclear bullshit! never seating charts lunch room known put line order boys girls different tables. Sometimes need break choosing sit friend bc don’t finish eating bc talk much. ;) 

But sadly, eating classrooms year. desk shields show movie talking without masks on. 

They’re really good minding talking, it’s sucky class experience compare previous years. :-/ Yes money talks AZ production shortfalls big conspiracy Boris Johnson make EU look bad?

lol. Desperation making people delusional. work clinical school setting students 9-21. Many behavioral and/or medical difficulties make difficult even unsafe wear masks, even face shield. Many need help self care, toileting, feeding, etc. provided single, one layer polyester mask thin looks like tissue paper hold good light.

I’ve personally spent $500 least pocket kn95 kf94 masks far year. us assume level risk healthcare providers, especially students mostly wear masks kind. 

I’ve asked multiple times if, given level risk exposed to, would consider providing least kn95 masks employees wanted them. told “NO.” wife works retail, employer providing kn95 mask daily, beginning pandemic.

Really makes feel valued. Idk, fauci claimed 85% something need that. Even vaccinate every adult well 85% population. think percentages counting percentages adults, kids still get spread virus well. end June/mid July expect we'll vaccinated adults want vaccine though, hopefully approval 16-18 year olds since biden bought extra 200 million doses 100 million people, that's mostly going kids getting that, doses use unless plan additional boosters something Great news. We've million day (7 day average) several days now. think 2M day stretch long supply holds out. Seems like bare minimum point considering ways vaccinations still expanded. Congrats!!! holy shit, fucking sold. here. I’m Australia agree you. Obviously it’s much easier island. think people get frustrated “you’re island COURSE it’s easier” crowd completely dismisses fact Australia (and New Zealand) could completely fucked like countries (including island nations) acted fast strong reaping rewards. 

For countries sort results would also act fast unfortunately many slow make big changes beginning. world saw Wuhan Italy didn’t act fast enough given world super mobile international travel days. longer country takes implement changes longer virus gain foothold harder contain. wife found secondary contact.

Okay, we'll see then. 100% - teachers everywhere taking position, going sacrificing personal health people pitch fit. 100% - teachers everywhere taking position, going sacrificing personal health people pitch fit.

So desperately trying get much vaccines even means targeting allies. It’s matter time becomes every country themselves.

I’ve letting people fluff tail feathers. sense bringing others lower morale. Even height pandemic October 1918, influenza stories sometimes made front pages. keep morale, headlines flu stories—like “Death Rates Mount Cases Decline”—tried put positive spin bad news. Despite limitations, newspapers major source researching pandemic. addition case death statistics, printed health advice city; reported work doctors, nurses, volunteers; recorded deaths people walks life, society matrons  could end year. Supposedly, China cases Covid right (which accept fact). think hope, think either side trying predict future. Predicting future scientific medical. So, say either. I'm saying pre-caution. last pandemic 2009 2010 (swine flu). flu deadly, still. Even humanity wins Covid, there's still another chance another pandemic. Question. wearing mask still get Covid, less severe infection right? cascade people infect? Officially vaccinated Moderna! Pretty wild feeling! I've following Moderna company since mid 2019. knew little year later I'd taking vaccine middle pandemic. modding sub. Stop it! You’re ruining doomsday fantasy! AZ signed deal us millions euros

Yes did. Months signing better agreemetns people, know, tough shit wait turn. like take EU officials buggered whole thing you. shocking fact 100 percent current population planet die point. mean community transmission carries impacts rate infection schools bad close? agree Nobody explain it. I've heard people theorizing held back second doses, others saying inventory stuck CVS/Walgreens, others say states poor reporting doses used, still others claiming held back manufacturer finishing inventories. 

I've never heard definitive explanation, nobody seems interested finding out. mind blowing.

The Biden coronavirus team asked news conference today, see answer here:

[Biden team try explain massive difference Dude nobody EU parliament. He's party Merkel, that's hardly enough call ""ally"". ""Meaningfully better"" mean ""completely gone."" Large indoor gatherings absolute last thing return. ""Meaningfully better"" means much lower risk, ability see family socialize, go eat restaurant choose. personal estimate first day spring, pandemic back level September - present, cases/hospitalizations 20% bad winter peak got. then, getting better fades away almost entirely summer. seems problem prevented spread isolation hotel quarantined. isolation clock needs restart everytime quarantined people interact eachother.  sound intelligent 5 days since first I'm fucking itchy go damn restaurant leave fat tip waiter Exactly. Driving around ring road rental car exactly tokyo subway haha PAID doses

Not yet haven't, doses made ones UK paid for, queue later. That's great, absolutely nothing refute US' system ranked 38th 191, globally. That's including cost access. Canada, reddit's healthcare darling, ranked yes, another ""America bad!"" reddit meme. social media astroturfed foreign actors vested interest harming US, par Canada's 84th percentile worldwide reddit considers great. US' 80th percentile worldwide people say ""an actual healthcare think that's dumb shit, know tell according KFF poll conducted July, 86 percent Americans insurance rate personal coverage incoming Congress prepares debate changes U.S. healthcare system, solid majorities Americans rate coverage (69%) quality (80%) healthcare personally receive ""excellent"" ""good.""

But get news opinions reddit, know that. really surprise, reddit always disconnected reality, Ron Paul circlejerk days current Bernie Sanders circlejerk now. anyone else extremely tired ""hygiene marketing""?

Basically, companies longer advertise product they're advertising safety measures. Look, work marketing understand is, god become loathsome. live NZ, folks sensitive Covid like freedoms come :-) 

I think expectation amongst population NZ forever Covid-free. mean, there's idiots everywhere, there's bound loud minority screeching. 70% population going get vaccine. planning first birthday makes sad! know won’t remember, it’s piece new mom really feels like I’m missing out. :( bigger problems world sure still makes sad. aren't, total admission 14%, schools ""fully open"".  Many people actually didn’t enroll kids all
And moved nearby suburbs 
So it’s combination resolved much AZ export 4m doses EU UK December ... ok then. realise Express? know, know Yeah it’s US. really got UK &amp; EU spun variants Americans like “meh” LOL people upvoted front page? Nearly half Americans need vaccine, also working headline. Immunocompromised, healthcare workers, elderly prioritized everyone. Something like 80% higher deaths occurs people aged 55+... prevent deaths vaccine prevent spread good hygiene distance. What? Tons schools fully open. suffering lives count, way actually gave shit. Honestly I've seen much flip side people going overboard unnecessary/useless things fear. people seem fully comprehend diseases spread data that's available covid-19 specifically. 8% thing said official. Yes, Biden totally create entire new health care system independent Congress. /s school district voted away sort health metrics students starting back person next week. 20-30 kids per room. 3 feet apart. contact tracing happening, yet teachers arent given COVID-19 leave get sick unless prove got work. 100 cases schools past three weeks due limited number students staff going state testing. Im afraid, yet according district parents dont get afraid. get go work. babysit. Shame brain muscles I'm American love country, even served military deployed I'm patriot love country. think wanting better bashing mom dropped head much baby. think unlikely EU would knowingly signed contract saying receive vaccines UK finished vaccination program.


It's unlikely, unethical, perhaps illegal, EU contract declare details first UK contract. AZ allowed wording entire legal team needs firing. even say wording later contract can't overule prior another party, UK contract signed first says priority matter EU contract says all. businessinsider may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

What fucking sense make? 1. “Great Plague” (the 17th century outbreak pandemic) Black Death (the 14th century pandemic Black Plague disease caused pathogen killed massive sections Europe’s population).

2. valid way compare death tolls disasters centuries apart percentage population. Raw numbers demographic statistics meaningless beyond 50 years.

3. could pretty easily pull together list tens thousands minor natural disasters, transportation disasters, terror attacks killed two dozen less people say “look covid killed thousands disasters combined”. “Every terror attack war since 1945” absurdly meaningless.

It would legitimate draw comparisons widely known mass death events last 50 years. Hurricanes Katrina Maria. 9/11. Iraq Afghanistan wars. Vietnam war. Hell, 60K killed private healthcare US every year.

The way written makes heap whatever author could come random disregarding standards comparability. think selfish saying economy important peoples lives. become another way virtue signal. wear mask outside people stare daggers me. ridiculous. Osterholm knowledgeable guy lot experience. However, nowhere near good thinks communicating public. Honestly don’t think level bluntness helping all, need tactful, empathetic people communicate information public. optimistic wildly so. fact cases coming we're beginning vaccinate lot really good thing help make end significantly faster would otherwise case. Easier get immunity cases low compared higher lot virus going around running news stories creating education programs *healthcare workers* live high levels refusal. safe assume insignificant minority. think amount take end increasing overall sufficient, nonetheless. believe imposing restrictions case. Rate transmission going plummet vaccination rates go 50% population I’m already naturally anxious person pandemic magnified ten fold. feel uncomfortable time. I’ve become touch adverse anything even slightly brushing fingers arms causes panic. mood shifts drastically optimism hopefullness paranoia depressive episodes next. It’s awful. sure hate brother way worth posting? Cuomo simple math population 20 million 300k doses per week adds year.

This assumes increase supply also vaccinate every single person, silly lot people refuse (and refused) take it, vaccinate at-risk people huge positive effect. really,

The UK relying primarily AstraZeneca vaccine. 2 million doses week. minority already Pfizer would horrible get 2nd dose.

Even UK gave every single one 2 million AstraZeneca vaccines week EU - enough make 80,000,000 EU wants time. numbers mismatch population EU, UK production sites UK EU.

This Pascal Soriat mentioning interview yesterday.

This needs based contracts - suspect UK stronger claim EU signed weak contract. Lol country parents fuming kids can't go back normal school yet know need shot blood drawn, totally ruins day anxiety. fine every time.

Still can't get needle anxiety.   I'll agree that. local community college churns RN's associates graduates...I know got two years. wish 4 year degree RN's there. think would help separate chaff wheat more. second biggest day food alcohol consumption us one busiest bar days year. initial press conference mentioned, Trump said ""could game changer."" say definitive cure. agree Trump lane discuss therapy modalities, gotten point people exaggerating said press conference. Also Texas. gotten 4 calls past week. son told two kids class week. Since date kids tested positive last there. never got direct contact call. Exact same. trying stay afloat lift California’s stay home order!
And repeal Wisconsin’s mask mandates!! EU took ride fucking ordering getting worse contract 3 months people already paid signed vaccine. Exact same. trying stay afloat Im high school teacher live apartment complex near schools district. NEVER see kids wearing masks hang out. lot people sit around chin. remote MASSIVE cases area carelessness teens young adults. Parents want kids happy rest us suffering it.

Here's get mad: kids wanted go back bad community really saw issue would FOLLOWED FUCKING GUIDELINES. one blame complain people don't. solely fault. 

So person. Thank god district Missouri remained virtual. wildly optimistic can't pandemic last years? That's outside realm possibility. say goes comfort boundaries. remember CDC said useless wear masks, early last year. Um, like, people turn wrong? Even authority figures? Wake up. Yeah mean simple know huge deal. Children virtually risk getting sick virus. teachers, especially older health conditions, considerable risk. Also anyone kids home risk.

So simple solution vaccinate teachers grandparents let kids go back school. end riskier regular year.  * Mugabe fiasco: policy, personal
* Genocide allegations: policy, personal
* ICC stance: policy, personal

Try again.  Reddit like British anymore evidence required. UK paid vaccines months ahead EU, EU expecting earlier orders countries ignored cover badly bungled ordering. It’s toothless threat. going do, de-license every teacher? strength solidarity.

This foolish irresponsible statement. management contesting board profit corporation looking bottom line, idealistic single-party state government sees teachers enemy. 

Yes, 100% chance OK TX state government would fire, delicense revoke pensions every striking teacher.

These people see public education burden placed upon prior generations would THRILLED opportunity sell public education assets private charter organizations pennies dollar. 

You understand happend N.O. Katrina, right? 

Solidarity movement like must broader simply public educator profession, must entire working class. Currently TX OK working class believes teachers enemy. rational solutions teachers places leave profession way protects individual interests. agree, problem people crappy cloth mask. idea believe move towards standard even poorly fitted mask it'll provide protection  anecdotes literally almost every day daily thread. ever 100 percent safe leave house? Osterholm variously said ""we"" would regret decision act ebola African problem.

The issue science reporting scientists terrible public speaking pretty much across board. Frankly though, think even Africa regret creating vaccine ebola specific outbreaks concentrated. never going rampant continent way covid rampant across world.

Ebola pretty much spreads due lack education willingness maintain basic hygiene around sick people dead bodies. Excellent summary, excellent writeup, excellent news. Source ? like best decision still anti-maskers refuse kids mask.

Our district made simple: Masks mandatory in-school learning, medical exemptions. student can't wear mask parents want to, they're remote learning - luck school hallways overcrowded rooms fit many students desks 6ft apart. Plus need plastic barriers around every single desk hand sanitizer, costly too

There's need plastic barriers around every desk classroom true cohort (which recommendation elementary middle school).  someone cohort tests positive, everyone quarantines regardless seating luck it’s freaking cold outside. works summer you’ll need ACs, know ACs blow covid particles everyone’s faces.

We live Connecticut temperatures teens last couple weeks. Windows doors open every classroom really big deal - kids throw sweatshirt.

&amp;#x200B;

My kids attend Title public school. school building constructed early 1950s A/C. They've classroom 4 full days week since September, school 400 students - including significant special ed population - total 2 confirmed covid cases time.  Neither case resulted known in-school transmission.

This say super-easy - time can't let perfect enemy good. simple, cost-effective ways mitigate many risks least younger students classrooms worth taking steps stop significant harm caused vulnerable children. happen Trump power? U.K. don’t really know. let think EU also partially trying pass blame poor vaccine decisions

AZ let all. EU tried political put money company UK, rather tried find EU based vaccine. AZ wrote contracts wrote, EU came table late AZ made clear best effort contract. 

Once AZ fulfills UK's orders (and anyone else line front EU), EU start receive product, before. 1: ok what? respect contracts anyway;

2: operate biggest free market world would damage matter what. reputation damage whole thing bad AZ. look stocks right now, would red worst case scenario EU. EU hand economic problem deal with, could buy vaccines others soon. delivering millions countries 

That's happens late order, go priority list.  0? Like egg pulled someone's ass. forget schools suspending students truth sayers. (some, I'm sure) also disclosing information covid all. would take 0 little trust whether small school not. school's budget. Less students, less money. Would willingly send kids school knowing school x-amount cases day day? know wouldn't. One agreed upon contract, breach contract. Absolutely, 100%. done global studies people's acceptance vaccines results disturbingly guess would say 50-60% US eligible population (i.e. adults) take year, probably higher areas lower others. gradually trend higher skeptics see dire side effects. ends required certain things like travel concerts might drive higher. whatever reason people widely skeptical vaccines. think necessarily outspoken, whacko Facebook-spamming anti-vaxxers quietly want take it.

I went dentist weeks ago asked 60-something hygienist taken vaccine said would ""wait while"". someone sticks fingers people's mouths day, also presumably educated health care worker. reports 50% health care workers nursing home employees taking it.  UK plants even make enough export, would take year fulfill EU's order. Yep. initial dismissive attitude towards masks single dumbest thing coronavirus handling America. Lying try allow hospitals mask access made topic political made large portion Americans trust facts / science now. Yep. initial dismissive attitude towards masks single dumbest thing coronavirus handling America. Lying try allow hospitals mask access made topic political made large portion Americans trust facts / science now. School free childcare - teachers essential workers. essential work coddled much teachers year. It’s absurd. Private schools open successfully several places public schools shut - it’s complete failure generations kids. minority them. Many people wear ones poorly effective. Obviously really care one country, especially small Israel, goes screwing Canada.

Screwing large number countries though another matter. Furthermore, big business take note EU may breach contracts time. means increased risk, big upside manufacturing EU first place stability. EU may maiming long run pulling kind thing. showing badly messed vaccine ordering trying distract angry populace. Guess I'll die, then.  maybe can't bubbled protected cared differently. healthy 25 year old 0.0001% risk exact thing 80 year old 5% risk?

I mean things differently. 25 year olds likely working going society more. asking take precautions try slow spread risk people safer go out. fact surprised steady rate hospitalizations fatalities exact demographic week week, month month. knew 6 months ago exactly risk yet people getting virus. 75 health conditions ultra careful?

Again yes risk people need careful higher rate community spread higher risk targeted risks like breast cancer, target demographic identified become part campaign screen protect them, effective. somehow never happened Covid, think due part fact people understand facts.

Maybe covid spread everyone infected? get breast cancer walking store. right something coming say. harshest restrictions lifted area received 1 slumber party invite several birthday party invites. JUNE. anti-masker friend mine asked could start getting kids together playmates cause restrictions gone. ended taking social media break.

Our schools reopening school history hiding things concern case everything humanly possible hide it. school board voted favor removing temperature checks going back 4 days week. I'm confused logical. New phone, dis? I'm saying stolen. I'm saying AZ either break EU contract putting ""best effort"" break UK vaccinationalism contract stipulates UK produced doses stay UK. 

The issue AZ informed EU moment knew able deliver 80m Q1, way earlier last Friday. 

Their CEO also needs stop spreading contradicting information december delivery posted another comment: interviews various European newspapers, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot argues Europe UK supplied two separate production lines. UK receives vaccines two British production sites, Europe factories Belgium Netherlands. According Soriot, Europe unlucky production problems occurring 'its' factories. good vaccine numbers EU. bad headline, really point switch curbside/delivery Many masks 95% effective one them. rest, results vary wildly depending variety factors. disaster public health messaging. Credibility already damaged change mask recommendations it’s going free all. needs happen now. EU completely messed vaccinations schemes, messed vaccination ordering, messed vaccination contracts missed early ordering... wants everything early everyone else. EU stops exporting Pfizer Moderna vaccines. export papers machine UK go brrrr  95% also proper fit facial hair. poorly fit N95 going heaps better good cloth mask. Savage, true. People need stop living fear virus many diseases think people like working home cause lazy get case, totally agree district would safe public. ton admin, unfortunately largely incompetent and/or influenced political propaganda. extent regions rely pandemic-ravaged businesses support economy likely strong correlation quickly ""normalcy"" returns area. Economics underpins everything.

Here Orlando I'm anticipating massive push reopening. Cleveland Denver, perhaps less so. Agreed. top there’s spillover effect things get much worse if/when schools shut down. I’ve seen friends — schools shutdown, parents want need keep working, kids spend days friends houses masks, far worse properly supervised cleaned school setting. Instead comprised medium end severe lockdown combination uncontrolled spread driven assholes.  Taking N Korea vaccine hugging 20 people virus. safer? Guess what? largely work... vaccines good sell entitled opinions facts. 

I work big pharma. never have. 

But studied COVID-19 [interventional clinical part job. even expect get paid work. 

Not lot money writing Toxicology Textbook chapters. Even less money allow people read free. 

Yes, one manufacturer attenuated (i.e., weakened) polio vaccine poor job people given polio vaccine. deadly mistake. 

But even things got better. problem fixed lives saved enough people got polio vaccine. 

That kind mistake cannot happen RNA vaccines. work way. RNA viruses need RNA proteins spread. 

And coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 really long genomes. 

The Moderna Pfizer vaccines use small part viral RNA bodies make proteins outside virus. 

That small piece nearly enough make functional virus. like trying make recipe without instructions. 

That cases people getting COVID-19 RNA vaccines. bad kids, also families return home school. I'm education, puts people risk. SARS #1 would beg differ. Canada almost single-handedly prolonged pandemic months beyond ended wanted tourism $$$ first though, too... Guess what? largely work... vaccines good sell Read article, did, went 100+ reusable masks day student tossed school anyway instead reusing next day. Guys thinking bad flu season..back bus please. UK could wasted lot money vaccines failed trials. Two vaccines far stopped trials. 

Not sure that's technically failure, might decided better option produce one vaccines licence. know there. best effort clause comes play. 

Basically EU late party, get left overs. various reports efficacy first dose 80-90% (depending vaccine) 10-12 days. 2nd dose increases efficacy also makes last longer. skip 2nd dose get protection first.

For work environments, choose hours agree wearing KN95s. need better access them. going grocery store, somewhere outside, short trips, really doesn’t matter. piss people require minimal impact. Everyone wants vaccine soon one couple months. need force change IMO. makes sense. We're talking exports, trespassing. confused analogy. EU: want vaccine made you

UK/AZ: even approved vaccine?

If AstraZeneca already everything reasonable power, position all.

That means AstraZeneca breaching EU contract already.

What wrong this? covid predictions got right? pause. nothing changed environment explains fluctuation.

Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides Wednesday flatly rejected AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot's claim company required make ""best effort"" rather contractually obligated deliver certain quantity coronavirus vaccine.

""Pharmaceutical companies vaccine developers moral, societal contractual responsibility need uphold,"" Kyriakides said. ""The view company signed best effort agreement neither correct acceptable.""

An EU official earlier day called AstraZeneca's shortfall ""massive"": EU get quarter promised end March.

Kyriakides said EU demanding AstraZeneca make use production facilities — including two U.K. two Continent — fulfill Commission's purchase contracts. EU's contracts, call 400 million doses, restrict production factory Belgium, EU fact expected drugmaker would use capacity.

""We reject logic first come, first served,"" said. ""That may work neighborhood butcher’s contracts advanced purchase agreements.""

She said Commission AstraZeneca signed advanced purchase agreement — EU official said worth €336 million — build manufacturing capacity ""so deliver certain volume doses day [the vaccine] authorized,"" decision expected Friday.

""The logic agreements valid now,"" continued. ""We provide de-risking investment upfront, order get binding commitment company pre-produce even gets authorization. able ensure manufacturing capacity letter spirit agreement.""

Kyriakides also raised suspicion AstraZeneca can't meet first quarter orders sold doses countries.

""No company illusion means understand happening,"" said. ""We knowledge production doses, produced — sent anywhere — is."" treatable least one case early person needed epinephrine IV monitored overnight. Still edge case like said people monitoring afterwards. shit pie

Let's see here:

We told March last year would last two weeks stop spread.

We also told Fauci masks work.

We also told (by politicians) virus kills Grandma, stay home.

We actually seeing proof infection rates highest they've ever been.

We seeing proof new variants COVID deadlier may resistant current vaccines.

We seeing vaccine rollouts comically bungled daily, despite fact can't blame Trump once.

We still seeing governors (mine specifically) imply want schools virtual forever.

How get internet go tutor children. child struggling grade K blame point anyway. said thing you.

Not exactly. said ""no evidence vaccines effective"". said evidence effective. There's difference.

To make quick analogy highlight difference, like waking saying ""there's evidence sunny outside"" looking window. Maybe sunny, maybe not, seen evidence support it.

But looked window seen sunny outside.  correct new strains covid 2.0, aren’t going survive another lockdown/another year anyway living like gives fuck?

If think covid recovered travel planned within next 3 months, do. First, get tested today. 

* negative, perfect, wait 72 hours travel get tested (and test negative). Proceed travel.

* tested positive, big deal. document positive test, within 2 weeks travel go doctor get note saying symptoms. Proceed travel.

Again, where's issue? see entire human history examples

it's sad emmigration/refugees common revolution/freedom fighters I'm always reminded I’m betting meant 3.5 million  Yes. People understand Lipid Nano Particle deliver mRNA organ body. some, like unfortunate individual, body goes cytokine storm attacking cells/organ making spike protein. Stop spreading rubbish. Production EU started UK's order, EU's order. UK's order, production EU would behind. 

Those doses produced EU signed deal. could close expiry EU even authorised vaccine use, big issue?

Furthermore, EU deal gives entire output factories based EU. AstraZeneca legally allowed sell doses manufacturered countries. doses UK received legally belonged UK.  “We’re last weeks” “return normal hurry”

You sure optimistic! Yes, kids likely asymptomatic / subclinical makes schools optimal breeding ground outbreaks without regular testing.

Source: work high school covid testing program Send news channel Yes, citation put shows bit 90% look PCR confirmed symptomatic cases.

One thing wonder though, whether people actually got sick COVID (enough get symptoms) might different behavior afterwards? instance, catch COVID get sick, maybe they're bit likely safety behaviors like masking/distancing/etc following months? even see people much lasting symptoms. knows? Yup high EU placed order 3 months UK trying negotiate price (which failed already sold cost) meant 3 months less production EU 3 months less iron production issues. 

Why UK pay EU's incompetence?

 return AZ send vaccines UK failed inform EU production issues.

None 'sent' UK, UK ones produced UK EU ones produced EU. Produced EU, necessarily EU contract. doses shipped December, 4 months EU contract, 7 months UK contract. could quite easily produced result UK order.

We also frankly know much shipments, could vaccine produced UK shipped unused plant Germany bottling. also seems completely leaving group people hospitalized vaccinated, hospitals see astounding dropoff. 25 year olds filling hospitals. believe severe case even require hospitalization. Let's start root problem - parents sending sick kids school anyway.

What schools supposed do? kids show up, get sent home sick, come back next day mom dad can't afford go work.

The schools ignoring safety - can't ensure safe environment also can't afford open risk funding pulled - sure happening many states. Lol Eu country woukd gift vaccine doses, right least... local district created dashboard anyone could track outbreaks related schools. knew outbreak related son’s school sport team. However noticed cases related team never added portal. 

I called district’s communication director, despite knowing nothing public health policy person running dashboard. asked cases weren’t listed, requirements adding cases school dashboard. response felt could directly reach people risk tell isolate, could avoid posting case dashboard. thought posting many cases/outbreaks would cause people panic think schools aren’t safe. result desire keep people panicking, done several times. 

I explained failure report accurately kept family making informed decisions. making decisions community health, without basic understanding doing. suggested insist health department take control posting school information. declined said it’s important way. 

I typed email conversation concerns. consulted multiple concerned teachers writing email order include concerns, feared speaking out. sent email member school board, governor’s office, health department. 

I never received response. schools opening full days, increased access testing, vaccine teachers, weeks. Kids wipe desks baby wipes end class. Completely agree — interesting compare plague, all. wasn’t advocating stricter restrictions Good them. completely ridiculous pressure teachers return classrooms they've vaccinated vaccines rolling faster faster now. They've 10 months now, stay 2 months. good chance breach Spanish Flu number 670,000. could predicted beginning? WHO?! would pay money see high vaccine adoption rates spike every area right localized outbreak. We're year pandemic. I'm going continue arguing mask efficacy.

Also tons people social distancing. seen friends person months. bar restaurant since March 2020. go near anyone else work restroom one else there. friend lives Florida aside masks grocery store, say's live mostly normal.

I think I'll head stay weeks. seems EU trying pass blame poor management situation. Ignoring complexities manufacturing plants facing ignoring almost countries except maybe Israel yet getting near amount vaccine expected.

The EU salty UK failing outside EU, fact better European country. early pandemic administrator defended action (or inaction) compliance CDC reasonable. expect administrators experts infectious disease. created CDC.

However, April obvious CDC head ass administrators going figure themselves. superintendent's professional background foreign language instruction. However mid March, shut schools.

We need forgiving good faith mistakes operating well outside wheel house. continue cite CDC guidance, even trying. EU even seem trying blame French company, Novasep, all. Novasep tasked scaling production Belgium. relate this! Baby born mid-March 2020 thinks world consists basically 5 people total. meant way soft. science showing this? Doesn’t seem like would much difference far viral infection spread goes. lol. Infection rates dropping... Vaccination rates increasing... Look, want tell observe risk life, age group, risk covid extreemeeely low. concerned passing parents understand that, worried health data says statistically, really shouldn't. Add vaccine mix covid affect much papercut get (which also extremely unlikely vaccinated doses). Exactly. CA bad worse. whole narrative right completely upside down. people want? Since 0 risk virus eradicated, end game? Masks movie theaters 2030? international travel anymore? Kids hybrid learning years? purpose? agree. usually stare daggers walk by.  really death 1000 cuts AZ since december, eh? darling alllllll 2020...and they're basically getting fucked left right. doctors know better issues taking boosters. looking vaccine records day saw take Polio. Maybe un-elect Gov. Kevin Stitt blows another $2 mil something else. exchange guaranteed deliveries

[Not according AstraZeneca's didn’t commit EU, way. It’s commitment Europe: it’s best effort, said going make best effort. reason said Europe time wanted supplied less time UK, even though contract signed three months later. said, „Ok, we’re going best, we’re going try, cannot commit contractually three months behind UK“. knew super stretch goal know it’s big issue, pandemic. contract contractual commitment. It’s best effort. Basically, said we’re going try best, can’t guarantee we’re going succeed. fact, getting there, little bit delayed.  simple Google searches find similar situations still ""investigated"" seem suspicious: knows others reported made public. vaccine rollout recently started, read several reports healthy people getting vaccine ironically dying hours later. similar types symptoms. Covid hasn’t really changed day day life effect it’s society politics, shit storms begin with, skyrocketed depression. last year really indication world like kill spare next several years/decades something else kills me. area unenforced mostly blanket *If outside home, wear mask.* absolutely this. get far many people forced choose terrible options, majority parents see whining schools completely open. district K - 8 going 5 days week, whiners turned high schools. **Special needs career certificate programs went back 5 days first group, unique needs acknowledged made priority. 

It’s really problematic. area country it’s extremely political. Damn people crazy. Living reality completely defined far less 100% effective mask. hail order mask. can't believe anyone still listening governments countries right now. problem. trying part. Adding parents pressuring parents test, report tests schools. district found multiple groups parents using social media fliers neighborhood reminding parents report school kid positive could shut schools parents, tell schools test. Ya don’t think it’s LARPing unwarranted.

I’ve said it’s hospitals, think is. hospitals threatened, full reopening warranted.

There concern among many, share concern, Governments going take cautious approach reopening. evidenced host articles discourage people going vaccinated weird “some semblance normalcy” lines officials add statements.

In state, pretty close normal is, stadiums aren’t yet full still protective measures.

Once hospitals ok, think people really need vocal removing restrictions, unless want celebrity experts deciding cannot do.

It’s weird deal though, honestly, pretty much whatever want many states, people do. EU official wrote above; best effort completely standard clause, means company show overall effort develop deliver 

Now neither us read full contract despite that-- suggest overall effort development delivery vaccine would quite uncharitable. know price rope 12.99 amazon. mean ultimate end result natural train going ""the virus first manifests nose let's swab there"" ""the saliva replicates fastest let's swab there"" ""everything entire body leaves two places let's swab biggest one""

i think perhaps may scalable lmao Well, given increased levels alcohol consumption, business booming. would someone want forced get vaccine every crushing measure still need abide by? Like project warp speed, spend billions trillions find research get vaccine NINETY FIVE percent effective, still can’t see family vaccinated. 

I knew home state, Baker saying normal life resume word vaccine. Meaning stages reopening never fully open til word vaccine here. Then, vaccines roll shuts state further, due rising cases respectfully. less 24 hours inauguration, cancels curfew, puts week buffer stay home advisories still seeing near 5k cases day. 

It’s upsetting feel like roped drastic measures even everything patiently waited met normalcy could resume. told “haha yeah kids never go back school every small business saw never going float again.” end already realize good news get views fear mongering. loved NYT article. professional journalistic version “can not?” absolutely refreshing finally hear reason. watch people dumpsters every day alley outside apartment!

“Seattle entrepreneur” Lmao live Seattle go university hybrid last semester. semester, “higher ups” money forcing students staff return full face-to-face classes. 

We “contact tracing” place it’s requirement state it’s implemented. 

I got sick took Covid test. filled form everything. replied four days later asking “got results?” replied negative, proof anything. that’s it. want note legitimate N95 masks come children's sizes. specified children, seen fraudulent masks marketed child's N95s want put real thing. may wrong, vaccines virus unlikely mutate (way less antibody treatments immunocompromised patients). 


The reason virus arrives vaccinated person, replicates little, mutations happen gets eradicated. theory, could virus mutating healthy person, hitting mutation also avoids vaccine-created antibodies, also likely so. 


Unlike regular immunity, virus way copies way time learn avoid immune system - even took multiple millions people getting sick almost year get new variant somehow better escaping immunity. 


Kind like trying hack remote computer system writing random exploits. One hacker direct access million queries minute, another one needs send usb stick remote host waits days get reply. result working exploit, latter take infinitely time. seen nyc sub summer. incredibly low numbers months, hardly anything open. time anyone even remotely suggested *try* open things, met anger, name calling, opposition said open anything up, numbers go up. ""We can't go back April!!"" common phrase.

It got point us really wondering agenda was? obvious determined group people actively instilling fear tried loosen restrictions, hell would break loose. Subtract already vaccinated 18s vax hesitant number gets little better. Masks small part protective measures Covid. Social distancing much important. Many people that, what's point masks? hygiene theater journalists sleep night bullshit clickbait put out? much misinformation doom gloom articles get clicks. harmful psyche general population. Lost ""...children wearing masks correctly"" might breach contract vaccines produced Netherlands could've European stock too, since AstraZeneca also use production facility Netherlands produce EU's vaccines. 

Why? doubt deliveries contingent manufacturing plant, doubt agreement specifically forbids AZ using plants EU fulfil prior obligations would heard vaccines could've gone EU too, considered breach ""best effort"" contract. 

Why? Fulfilling concrete set dates pre-existing contract breach ""best effort"" following labor laws EU contract nothing UK contract 

True, prior AZ obligations everything deliver later obligations best efforts.

The crux issue AZ ulterior reason screw EU particular, especially EU larger market. Fact signed contract later clause weaker. EU consider anything want breach contract, mean makes least bit sense. Lol joke, could correct! Covid carried fecal matter, wet fart could well spread it. agree completely. must never happen again. world stop like absolutely restrictions executive emergency. one kind power control gatherings business unlimited amount time. president, Prime minister Governor mayor monarch. see, then. know (Princeton?) one making rounds several months ago, pretty quickly disputed here, though continued shared. France humiliated.

France one anti-vax countries world.

Pasteur Institute vaccine abandoned.

Sanofi vaccine failed.

Novasep, French company, failed get production Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine going Belgium. That’s everyone. People manage best can. PM need chat! I'm ears! Ok, let reiterate, never tested Covid. never doctor Covid. nurse would hit power button wireless switch laptop every time turned off

I really need know logic one... Didn’t even take parents 2 weeks, FWIW. 65+, day sore arm mild fatigue. That's misleading. saying relaxing restrictions early lead larger number cases ultimate defeat virus summer, happen either way.

In event, cases currently look like they're falling cliff. follow previous patterns, take couple months there's another outbreak, point deep vaccination, thus preventing anything maybe modest outbreak.

I think we're last weeks nightmare, things start return normal hurry, least U.S. EU 3 months behind UK come 4m doses delivered EU UK December welsh plant operational. Socialism everyone equally poor. really.

1: AZ nonprofit.

2: think world going line buy vaccines EU leaves table? 100% capacity bought matter do. Almost predictions seen covid deaths ended way high. still using Neil Ferguson model back March, even though consistently wrong? media report ""worst case scenario"" number scientific model ignore claim ""most likely"" number? Yup, definitely taken toll me, stupid pandemic almost so... Probably get covid. covid (even without vaccine) probably get seriously sick anyway. think much younger median age lot it. rates hospitalization death goes fast age 30. Many deaths western world among old—something like 40% deaths nursing home residents—but lot people 50s 60s dying too.  
 
plus, even leaving question deaths aside, there’s problem hospitals overwhelmed sick people. enough people get sick enough hospitalized once, causes big problems society whole even recover eventually everyone thinks expert Internet. many people believe critical thinking skill could learn innately easily proper guidance rigorous assessment. (Shorthand: many dumbdumbs think they're smaht) doubt it. european countries starting see big spikes UK tourist friendly places mean compared big cities, pretty near-normal. Even comparing Chicago (not normal all) Cleveland (near normal) worlds apart much better mental health. agree think usage masks things improve become next big debate. order something Amazon contract Amazon. It’s problem Amazon contracts work Amazon2 messes up.

Same here. contract AZ, Novasep. 

It’s weird would posted upvoted that’s law works anywhere luckily.

Amazon can’t tell fuck delivery partner fails fulfil contract them. That’s issue. contract. I’m business them.  literally refused work together make better. friends family California back school. Surprised hear there’s school isn’t. 

Having said that, I’m Washington also full time remote school almost year absolutely agree it’s devastating seeing horrible affects remote school. Social skills drastically dropped, education dropped, attitude gotten worse. really devastating aspects them. sell dirt cheap since surplus? Nah meant spread everywhere US could. make bonkers comments consistently I've started recognizing username reading frequently. 

You really get hobby covid denier. There's one solution real-world problem. e.g. Agree border control deal geographic neighbours. China longest land borders world, stop China control covid19. Hopefully. Hell I’d even pretty okay late summer safe enough party raves, go amusement park, get system, return average new normal Honestly? isnt much left reopen NOW. Much less 2022. rural Midwest county almost completely brainwashed believing vaccine can't trusted. First all, received 2 batches 100 doses. So, Tuesday offer county healthy dept. that's sign make appt. 65. sister registered nurse get it, saying she'll wait six months till safe. Yep. Welcome America.  literally indicated press conference indoor dining probably return soon. You’re staying home two years. That’s happening. don’t understand people think rewrite actual medical advice? Especially children’s lives stake! fuck would “take chances” somebody else’s children.   already know, especially help any.  happening world wide btw. mean relatively might hurt AstraZeneca more. consider economic value lost using AstraZeneca vaccines. damage much greater absolute terms compared punishing AstraZeneca.

Now delay 60% cut around 2 weeks. EU probably enough vaccines give everyone vaccine wants one beginning June. refuse AstraZeneca vaccines, delay like months. enough vaccines August September put behind schedule compared UK US. quickly vaccinated UK US goal. think take loss now, look still get 60% number lower, eventually possible legal action/fines. yes, course pay vaccines receiving time now. **Breaking news!!** Life leading cause death. News 11. removed requirement one cared.  Thankfully program able uphold measures site. much getting bus school cough. everyone wants keep schools open bad aren’t prioritizing teachers vaccination? NJ actually prioritized SMOKERS teachers! It’s flabbergasting least post spiking depression anxiety bang on. HAHAHA. Ha. Ugh... Utah policies place schools 🤦🏽‍♀️ I'll follow whatever regulations place, I'm avoiding air travel crowded bars. I'm going travel see friends/family. Sorry sorry. I'm willing live minor risk mild Covid. People need stop pretending RISK viable outcome. not. Get country 300 plus million people named municipalities maybe 20-30 million people can’t indoor dining. doesn’t seem like compelling evidence idea we’re gonna keeping restrictions place past point necessary. UK refuse export AZ vaccines EU, seems like hold back Pfizer vaccines produced EU.

Should close border France, Holland Belgium UK well. Maybe would focus minds.  someone deliberately, that's still 'if', hope individual finest company rest miserable cell bound life. could work since literally idiot stab someone. need least 1 professional every 10 watch first several days.  1 pro per 30 incase allergic reactions.

Or something, good try need SOMEONE experience guide first. I'm confused got vaccine ignoring yeah dude good gold honestly  Well can't UK owns them. They've paid up-front. AstraZeneca handles UK's behalf. teach k-8 school Arizona. decent network teachers parents nearby schools. one area high schools, kid covid, parent told let kid's friends parents know could tested. asked test and/or report. 

The high school near house parents Facebook next door saying get kids tested tell school sick, numbers low kids back person learning. 

Meanwhile lost parent one students. Another student's parent vented proned. People dying. Also, disease that;s around quite time, TB, kills \~1.4 million per year. want know spreads? Yup, guessed it, like covid.  covid measures flaws absolutely need mass vaccination campaign get anywhere: 

Seems like best decision still anti-maskers refuse kids mask. states don’t even mask mandates yet. It’s slow process distancing 

Good luck school hallways overcrowded rooms fit many students desks 6ft apart. Plus need plastic barriers around every single desk hand sanitizer, costly circulation/filtering 

Good luck it’s freaking cold outside. works summer you’ll need ACs, know ACs blow covid particles everyone’s faces. filtration systems costly setup manage, it’s effective spring/fall temperature manageable. what's take it?

So EU screwed every possible point...

Their reaction?

Try steal vaccines froms UK.  “I think consequence immediately stop export BioNTech middle trade war. company UK better think twice really want stop export.”

Literally words. Also vaccinated zero reason anyone restricting behavior misplaced sense ""solidarity""  Likewise, AZ vaccine would exist without UK Someone go first 😅 Given headline even reflect quote that's bingo. Nice assume everybody elderly family. Sheesh. Damn, problem solved then, guess u/Veils93 genius opposed doctors professionals. /s can't keep rabies control, they're moving forward this? 


Okay. guess. v(.\_.)v I'm going go ahead guess person signed contract first went ahead stipulated 'deliver us first'. later contract 3rd party can't overrule that, would breach first contract. late EU signing probably dozen contracts queue. EU trying throw UK bus, even though situation caused EU moving way slowly legal mask mandate decrease suicides Ods? cold, dead hands? would wasted, afraid! Hopefully  in, calories out.

You can't explain that. Ya Fair enough. old you? Unless you’re child watches Nickelodeon 24/7, farts shouldn’t seen funny source humor. STAY FUCK HOME.

Is really necessary drop ""F"""" bomb? make argument stronger impactful. low class. Maybe people moved out? enrolling kid school because, doesn’t make sense. sources? seem reliable me. Get real sources. we'll talk. Spot on. Look salon: based fear mongering claim non peer reviewed pre print. Ha! Sorry double reply think anyone goes sort shock would monitored overnight. Well pretty clearly like ideals EU built that's voted remain. difficult watch stupid fight last 48 hours though. contract right suppliers

Not entirely, big French vaccine failed setting EU back further. made complete mess trying distract failures making AZ enemy. nothing do. obey law.

Pfizer already okay following export bans USA. Otherwise would shipments Canada instead shipments EU. people complain need another stimulus smh people really, really want live apocalypse. It’s plastic muffles voice really good. Yeah, I'm pretty sure managing finances fundamental basic survival living own. get vaccine virus likely get ill(or severely ill?)  think kinda depends old kids though, elementary age older? reasonable. We'll see  wait anger towards CCP rightfully follows, you’ll pikachuing mirrors Quick reminder everyone liking ideals EU built mean like EU current state much medical scientific evidence predict lasting years Trump said would gone April. Maybe want get hopes get disappointed again, stop spreading doom gloom around everybody else. see different many vaccines required travel certain parts globe. happily step rotting corpse antivaxxer wants give up. saw these. have? ones I’ve seen look awkward. think outer edges took wide remember someone saying would go away summer.

That's heard, Island nightlife rumored surprisingly 'hot' ;) things actually better, I'll order takeout actually spend time store normally do. stuff like seeing shows, going zoo, I'll wait little bit longer. 

Then again, I'll probably never go show again. Someone group I'll see live tested positive beginning month. depending health, might able see show not. heard people like get worse months getting ""better."" still horrible fatigue really felt better week ago. “Selfish” keep using word. don’t think means think means. median income Chicago South Side $34,316.00, exactly high bar meet. familiar rental prices/cost living San Fran know seriously proposed stimulus packages meaningful family situation. 

To bad take checks people impacted COVID financially used provide family food housing security. vaccines exist yet, long lead orders. Sames UK's order Moderna, 'If need later, case' order. Bruh what? Meanwhile Belgium 4 cases British variant one school pannick attack closed school every single kid parent needed get tested quzrantened week. Really?

[Yes, according KFF poll conducted July, 86 percent Americans insurance rate personal coverage positively.

[For incoming Congress prepares debate changes U.S. healthcare system, solid majorities Americans rate coverage (69%) quality (80%) healthcare personally receive ""excellent"" ""good."" 

Are smart average 22 year old reddit what? people constantly consistently whining healthcare. Kids complaining *healthcare* lol. ever wondered even became narrative reddit begin with? would kids ***so*** concerned overwhelmingly negative views something Americans actually like, something rarely even effects people age first place? Really makes think, come keep hearing multiple people even nurse friends basically nobody likes current healthcare system?

They might idiots. Speak yourself. Farting fucking hilarious. That's pretty optimistic outlook US enough vaccine doses 200 million people end June atm. However could see things getting much better April/may, think we'll see normal til later summer. can’t force students wear mask. decided since state doesn’t mask mandate, couldn’t enforce it. wasn’t included handbook year. 

I think 95% compliance have. Unfortunately, teach alternative school. Oppositional defiance rampant. can’t damn thing wearing mask. realised suing nothing lawful leg stand turns attempted shakedown. 

What embarrassment. remainer feel pretty disgusted EU. Wrong. going zero cases now. PANDEMIC HERD IMMUNITY. vaccine rolls immunity community (without crazy deaths get there) adjust strategy. Covid around forever widespread immunity won’t devastating impact it’s countries it’s mishandled. Ok thanks makes sense Honestly, depends lot capacity vaccine impair transmission virus. First studies Israel looking encouraging we'll know March/April. would rather prick illiterate, lmao. one problems

They did, UK months ahead EU issues solved vaccinations started. go tv talking covid less trust them.

We need hit consistent 2mn vaccination rate daily order act like walk chew gum time. Nah look numbers without context get outta population adjustment fake narrative Why? saying true, people would argue normal people can't expected know manage finances.

What? Culturally insensitive lol 

It's silly name town.  Thanks dude! here, already cancelled trip last October, hope one sticks! case, always changed dates. *EU* gone mad. business contracts work. Date signing contract matter, agreed upon date delivery does. European factories exist months ago, EU even signed contract months ago. screwed want others cover missing early orders.

You guarantee UK delayed contracts EU took early order gamble 'it's first come first served' attitude. one intentionally see big prick though were. assessment absolutely correct. grammar nazi doesn’t anything better do. maybe try educate better human being. interview AstraZeneca CEO yesterday mentioned 4 plants Europe: Netherlands, Belgium, Germany Italy. first two making 'drug substance' latter two making 'drug product'. course going happen, thousands hospitals throughout US, going stuff like this...  countries referring to?

Like New Zealand? country really care negative test still puts quarantine 14 days?

New Zealand uses COVID tests, **rely** them. Access basically limited people living returning. wild *bat* chase begin!

FTFY UK currently getting &lt;2m doses week (possibly low 1.6m per week) AZ total including UK EU plants, send anywhere moment, even UK's daily vaccination numbers plummeted cliff due supply. Bashing others incompetence lead companies asking higher prices EU straight refuse business. 

Fact EU screwed signing contracts late.

Fact EU screwed spending 7 times less per capita pre orders, investment manufacturing vaccines UK US.

Manufacturing UK also delayed 2020, AZ delivered way less initially promised Q4 2020 UK. US. 

The EU delays happening paid late paid less. instead taking responsibility lashing like petulant child. Reality this... Parents demand teachers risks lives want free childcare back. exactly Michael Osterholm talking about. need vaccinate ebola Africa. look happening now. vaccinating ebola Africa. never claimed expert never claimed millions deaths. tried defend Michael Osterholm's point need vaccinate ebola Africa. looks like since dozens countries that. ""Best effort"" exactly that. promises delivery vaccine EU set time table make best effort quickly possible. another example corporate politicians centralizing faster cash flow wealthy expense.  Like Windows update??? Thaaaaaat going happen  guess that's true. Better taking someone word, figure.  problem adults administration. lot teacher friends want get sick, permanent health issues die this. local teacher died COVID Monday. exposed small group special ed students. 

Some teachers admins live help take care vulnerable family members. understand concerns picking school, especially kids seem highly asymptomatic. think fair throw concerns window. Hybrid possibility something better teacher in-person remote simultaneously. hospitals. Yeah can't admit failings. Instead they'd rather lash ""evil"" British neighbours. EU get bent. signed contract. UK signed contract first

AZ forbidden exporting vaccine UK fill UK's order entirety, AZ best effort clause EU's contract. 

Now EU bitchy can't get want. we’re vaccinated. I’m asking don’t want punked. bet it’ll deaths drop low. Norway whole class gets quarantined 10 days positive case. National guidelines pretty wild - comes drug prices public sentiment usually pharmaceuticals overpriced. think people desperate vaccines end pandemic ignore feelings.

Pfizer great product going save lot lives. mean taking steps maximize profits.  Also, posted yesterday stupid today.  *immediately blames teachers unions* *immediately blames teachers unions* Well maybe can't bubbled protected cared differently. healthy 25 year old 0.0001% risk exact thing 80 year old 5% risk?

In fact surprised steady rate hospitalizations fatalities exact demographic week week, month month. knew 6 months ago exactly risk yet people getting virus. 75 health conditions ultra careful?

In targeted risks like breast cancer, target demographic identified become part campaign screen protect them, effective. somehow never happened Covid, think due part fact people understand facts. almost certainly be. I’m still going grocery store wearing inferior cloth mask expert shove it! supply issues everyone, UK ordered Pfizer months advance EU supply cut. People making 174k married couple got checks. making 150k got full checks. friends million dollar home outright taxable income ""low"" received checks. gambled stock market options got even richer. Sending checks rich people benefit economy. argument cut taxes wealthy again. US \~420k official deaths, likely undercount. Also, epidemics tend grow exponentially. distance 400k deaths 1M deaths could happen much quickly going 100k 400k did. 

I agree 1m likely, vaccine distribution ramping winter bump likely over. reiterate: outside realm possibility. piece paper anyone replicate. People literally gone trouble fake negative covid test results get restrictions. Sorry, still trust you. AZ started production EU EU even ordered any. Explain that. UK's money enabled that.

And original plan produce UK's vaccine UK mean UK entitled doses manufactured elsewhere, mean UK effectively fund startup production EU. doses UK received belong anybody else. quote provided says **spare capacity** EU AstraZeneca said using continental facility initially booked capacity “which wanted use rather waste”

So point is, nothing happened wrong! vaccines ""stolen"" EU! Ancient Greek. Europeans don’t know queue They're deliberately misleading people letting think Black Death, actually different outbreak hundreds years later, affected one city. think we're actually totally agreement clear enough, and/or misunderstood.

The BS referred war profiteering behaviour, actual comment. behaviour fuels anti-vaxxer claims big pharma make buck (which *are*, mean bad thing... Pfizer pulls something like this). UK rejected 1.5 dose regimen instead approved 2 dose regimen countries approved it. EMA likely approve full 2 dose regimen well shit?

We’re middle pandemic bussing kids one school paid school program. Lol.

Kids progressively get closer closer together lunch administrators put closer closer save space.

It’s crazy. top that, testing ever. I’m South Carolina one school districts that’s given parent pressure.

The problem see school district one-size fits solution. in, daughter’s elementary school also lot courtyard space could utilized, specific school building. middle schooler’s building like prison windows even enough seating cafeteria seat grade level time. district needs make decisions work schools. 

Parents naturally look issue scope schools children attend, administrative side needs look entire district, include hundreds schools tens thousands students. still later everyone else. top aide, Andy Slavitt, also says 500 million shots would needed vaccinate Americans 16 older.

I like subtraction multiplication reportable news items. Novasep far failed everything covid vaccine related, EU currently trying distract that. Looks like Brexit already paying dividends. told next winter there’s new variant 

We Covid variant stories last summer; largely forgotten public, media jumped (along negative stories vaccines) vaccines approved November. 

Here's (from Summer) found quick don’t think anymore challenge way. shouldn’t open gen pop supply still crazy restricted wonder ramp respirator production give everybody one.

The reason we've decimated manufacturing sector. simply equipment, control raw materials make significant quantity. really need see manufacturing sector important national security. whole N95 mask fiasco tip iceberg comes compromised we've become relying global adversaries critical products equipment. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah that's fair. might get point though, vaccines going need full FDA licensure that's thing lot workplaces (outside patient facing jobs) Whatever point. mandates going start getting lifted around 6 weeks. can't imagine PA mandate would last May even Wolf.

Besides, lack mask mandate likely decreasing suicides drug/alcohol OD's among young people.  cases imported Australia going sick quarantining them. Could worse. heard Georgia school district proposed students change seats every 14 minutes next students full 15 minutes.

Which would let report zero exposures (no 15 minutes) would disrupted classes effect Covid19's ability spread-heck, would probably increase it.

I think district plan shot but...sheesh. live big district claims transmissions school, school go 100% virtual Thanksgiving enough teachers staff open schools. claim cases schools community transmission move along full classroom social distancing class. also NAL example vaccinations long required school kids, immunizations often required certain international travel. CDC ""recommends"" certain vaccines certain fields like health care workers think companies allowed require deemed essential job.

I sure push back outcry anti-vax freedumb lovers etc. given lockdowns think widely required. mean vaccine? mean personally vaccinated? mean reach high level vaccination? states, schools facing mandates state override semblance local control. stay open direct threat losing state funding coming school year. people get vaccinated relatively close time period would exposed new strains likely certainly immune. main concern terms reinfections people got mild asymptomatic first time would relatively weak antibodies importantly cells. know strong relationship cell counts severity although less case antibodies. think good news J&amp;J hundred million doses US end April assuming gets approval although suspect vaccination done Pfizer MRNA rather J&amp;J US. Given continuing supply coming assuming run supply everything going according plan.

over long run concern strains also general belief/hope people maintain better immunity average compared influenza given theorized better cell effectiveness compared flu. remains seen proven yet hopeful. Memory cells Coronaviruses last long time give partial full immunity. Can't assume sure case odds pretty good. stay tuned look history, think half posts Reddit bitching teaching year. love job working kids, sit desk day work individually students draining. can't imagine hard new teachers. Halloween? New years? Heck, even day thanksgiving?

There lot much bigger days, IMO. think people willing sit home Superbowl lot events. enough advacne, UK paid working late Summer, EU took extra 3 months suddenly expected efficiency manufacturing plants still wet pain walls. CDC issued vaccine passport, everybody should. want proof, merely ask. Quad-masking much commoner sense. I’d respect honest. “Fuck kids! Send public babysitter get back work generate profits!” know available looked online yeah. Fair one sure. I'm glad know know. tell parents anyway. Mine would thought either.  Months ago even contract EU place. production facilities even exist yet. Nope, PT, last five years moved towards homeopathy less traditional therapy methods. 

Some founded (orthopedic surgery pretty atrocious, prioritizes surgery prevention), much ridiculous mirrored science denial gaining traction days. disappointing. don’t think unreasonable mandate work places. mandating consumers seems iffy. know example don’t want stop wearing masks work unless bulk coworkers also vaccinated. America better europe feels weird American. Also looking vaccination rates uk looks better mainland. And... blocked. % wrong

95% getting covid symptom

0% getting severe covid symptom

Infection rate % unkown, correlating evidence points 5.6% 2 weeks second dose. 


That's over-time, people seen. increased spacing 3' 4' students. still means every positive case, 9 students quarantine spillover periods kids seated next positive case classes. controversy massive distraction play get regular people mad AZ/UK trying cover EU leaders completely screwed vaccination schemes. Interesting. article says Alabama thinks cannot limit vaccinations residents federal law. 

Florida limited vaccinations residents last week, haven’t heard anything illegal. popular move without residency requirement, even people foreign countries coming here. tourist agencies selling packages! 

So Alabama trying jockey tourist dollars telling people hands tied, Florida breaking law? Something between? 

I think Floridians would throw fit told turn taps become world destination well people cut supply. Millions residents need get lives resident seniors vaccinated. video says he's worried variants. variants still respond well vaccine, and/or shoot infection count get enough people vaccinated, yeah probably worst (fingers crossed case). not, well could right. That's math works. anywhere near 100% chance getting COVID even vaccine all. 
Also, single person across 30K+ people Pfizer+Moderna trials met criteria ""severe"" COVID, due blood oxygen level briefly dropping threshold counted. person even go hospital. Yeah probably giving much credit. 

I got healthcare. left speechless many, many occasions. Osterholm also emphatically told antimaskers/anti mitigation people keep name mouths. listen podcast week people probably loathes most. issues intertwined compounding. little family home since March, staying hopeful looking forward regular activities. felt isolating feel hope longing community. fall hit lasts administrations flag flag went everywhere around me, driving grocery would see 20+ flags small city 2 miles, comment section local news articles becoming aggressive deranged. heightened isolation even integrate back community feel welcome That's wild guess. Especially since ticket prices went way pandemic. That’s 95% effectiveness means. 95% effectiveness means vaccine study, X number people received placebo ended catching COVID-19, 5% X number people received real vaccine ended catching COVID-19. mean every single interaction someone COVID-19 gives 5% chance catching Disappointed ""tree fiddy"". true UK plan produce AZ vaccines original plan British doses produced supply chain set Oxford university AstraZeneca UK. vaccine manufactured behalf two biotech companies, Oxford BioMedica Cobra Therapeutics, filled finished Wockhart Wrexham.  \[UK manufacturing\] challenges,” said Ian McCubbin, task force’s manufacturing lead, press briefing Monday. “That’s little delay delivery doses.”  said using continental facility initially booked capacity “which wanted use rather waste”, problems British antibodies may affective mucosal cells, meaning amounts virus may able carried noses vaccinated people. prevent illness virus able get blood stream. However, since breathe nose, poses bigger threat unvaccinated people. degree could happen determined. Hopefully, case, briefly infectious infectious would unvaccinated, know yet extremely difficult determine. good idea least time being... We'll back normal life less soon enough. part make last couple months go well possible! individual making 150k would qualified stimulus payments passed currently seriously discussed. There's also argument made flat payments across board, even individuals ""need"" it, would actually net-positive terms total cost vs. increased economic activity ensured food security even edge cases like people lost high paying jobs last year's taxes filed. There's cost involved means testing stuff like this, especially need evaluate recurring proof people continuously qualify unemployment. whole lot easier less likely people falling cracks give kind UBI, even paid back later people.

Pay everybody, collect back following year extra federal tax assessment people file 2021 total income ends high year. watching spread new variants tells much travel still is. totally right. 
Also among early clusters rich ski vacationers Europe elsewhere.
There even article rich vacationers spread around poor local people die.  Precisely. COVID extremely uneven mortality curve means 'most people' deadly enough take seriously, contract spread around, finally reaches heavily affects, fill hospital wards. That's makes incredibly successful. SARS-1 spread symptomatically also super deadly pretty much everyone people much motivated stick preventative measures. Sane places standby lists open anyone prevent loss due wasting scarce resource. cannot physically control people’s behavior hope right, I'll take extra precautions careful possible. community : )) getting vaccine tomorrow. anyone know level (if any) protection gain first dose? second dose? anyone experience kind symptoms expect? way! I'm shocked! /s Depends part Texas. Texas cities, many people taking seriously. far see it, problem schools students teachers.

No need every student get vaccinated, need teachers comfortable classroom (and faculty lounge, parent conferences, assemblies, etc etc)

If specific parents worried infected kids they're high risk something, let home school setup online learning students. Yep, EU backed wrong horses, fumbled contracts slow sign missing early orders. 'We demand UK's vaccines, fair... Even though even authorised use yet'. Yeah, remember people said last March whole thing would Easter 2020. think we're least another year. Could years. That’s sad considering ran platform handling pandemic better totally fair, mean family willing stuff GFs, that's fine. issue people moment managing risks.

Its fact need start readying ""100% safe crew"" fact that's never happening don’t know you’re talking about. appear 6 top 10 countries islands America currently one bests vaccines programs world.

Please stop. effectively trapped island nation barring extreme quarantine processes normal? consider travel human right. Hmm. Explains see Rxed anymore. Thank you. 
🌈The Know🌠🌈 Trump (or original) promoter hydroxychloroquine COVID cure. Trump doctors listened people. 

I'm going stop breathing Trump breaths. Well said. Every persons’ pain worst pain they’ve ever felt. Pain relative post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  kids district reopened September masks supposed social distancing. sports going usual, masks sports.

An entire middle school shut two weeks many teachers sick werent enough left run classes.

No one seems care area. kids virtual forced come person testing fail. sucks. Well, pay Hydrochloroquine stockpile somehow. strange dichotomy, experts still sort preaching zero risk, actions politicians, republican democrat, country indicate know full well impossible.

That break parties COVID saw US gone, Dems Republicans seem acknowledge fatigue making severe restrictions fucking useless.

And none saying it, seems like everyone, red blue, keeps intentionally vague everything come memorial day.

But need make clear zero risk impossible know wonderful people going health crisis second politicians open everything public health experts sudden shift reality.

They need start admitting truth Tbf 425,000+ dead Americans 26,000,000 covid cases say it’s warranted. Great Plague 1665 probably well-known event UK

I'm UK I'd say Black Death far better-known, though suspect people would extremely hazy both. 1665 plague largely confined London, far less dominant now, whereas 1348 one affected whole country killed around 30 times many people. (Estimates vary lot, definitely order magnitude more, somewhere 25% 60% entire population.)

This *Independent* flinging poo usual. bottom line. There's alternative. can't stay shut forever. hate see it. Teachers state complained they're notified students test positive, count close contacts. close contact unmasked within 6' person, assumption never happens schools. Never mind kids closer basically unmonitored bus; never mind lunch unmasked indoors; never mind teachers almost always get within 6' students; forget special cases like speech therapy kid may close teacher hour.

It's really simple. Set bar high schools contact tracing never see spread schools. 

It's shame, we'd actually done reliable contact tracing plus pooled testing, perhaps could've safe school openings, closed targeted schools brief periods necessary. Instead, whole state go remote we've got field hospitals every major city. I'm genuinely confused we've gone route, pretend contact trace instead actually it. Hi, Karma? Oklahoma. MyPillow Goya commercial Resolute desk? many jaw dropping moments. here, productivity work plummeted see point working anymore I'm working absolutely nothing look forward to. shitty situation currently cant see light end tunnel. definitely, absolutely awful communication something want crucial stages. Yes someone said monitor someone’s lips see they’re suffocating would shaving face meant monitoring him. I’m trying make light scary situation exaggerated point ridiculousness. might another good reason avoid bars though. mean practically yes makes sense. 

The issue nation conditioned panic half dozen cases. People need (and currently don’t) understand even hit 60/70/whatever percent people vaccinated still cases, far fewer. 

If NZ’s bar opening borders back living actually normally (being trapped island isn’t normal) zero community spread - years minimum get there. Lockdowns ruin people bad virus people would like believe. say go it. I'm assuming ask proof residency? real downside guess drive 4 hours second dose im guessing? hey worth means getting vaccinated sooner data, politics. Don’t take gospel ball park. update often always admits right wrong. 

It’s exciting look model. opinion Covid endemic, follows seasonal patter (depending latitude) roughly following hope Simpson model. April virus fade away naturally coupled high natural vaccinated immunity. going see huge progress February March. almost there. daylight savings begins outlook much different future.


Also remember “herd immunity” also works gradually, mentions one recent tweets. even slightly “magic threshold” March/April/May even herd massively suppressing growth. always Observation effect data. sound hurt seating charts lunch? Kids sit assigned seats lunch? normal thing COVID thing? saying 2 years predicted 3 years beginning. logic, yes would two years.

But year ago, know vaccination possibility. thought would take 18-24 months product safe, effective vaccine.

Her prediction 2 years take developments account. think taking account ""2 years"" prediction PRIOR PREDICTION.

You know, one made vaccine breakthroughs.

Her prediction akin betting hockey team winning Stanley Cup based solely fact previous year. Statistically, unlikely happen people probably laugh using weak reasoning bet. Average = 312.2

School = 1146.1

School / Average = 3.67

Average / Average = 1

3.67 - 1 = 2.67 = 267% average. dog obtuse reason?? person ur enemy, chill Step public space 10 people (the strip starts glowing blue). least that’s seems like lately. People always conflating ""public health concern"" ""personal health concern"" driving insane. really failure science journalists across board.

Will global public health concern years come? YES.

Will local personal health concern years come? NO. say, vaccines new mutations obliged checked safe not? think anyone deemed essential worker free n95 mask every shift. really want prevent spread let essential workers know care would bigger impact. Supermarkets close 17.30, mean, live France another EU country personal experience, France harsh side things... Especially zero COVID risk lockdowns restrictions adds ton risk financially, socially, mentally.

Somehow never make metrics. covid curves. Let's hand wave away literally everything else talk it. 

What, can't stay away people 10 months? must weak. ignore spike mental health issues people ages.

You're broke? get remote tech job.  Approval AZ EMA expected granted Friday.

The EU also paid AZ starting production vaccines early, EU expect AZ notifying anything go planned. problem medical related conspiracy theories like HCQ, anti-vaxx stuff, etc handful MDs endorse theories takes validate minds people believe. present facts, research, testimonials medical professionals day people they'll turn around say ""nu uh, *this* doctor says...."". blame them? Thats board certified physician. earth able maintain credentials advocating dangerous shit beyond definitely makes stuff much difficult. 40 percent reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths United States occurred nursing homes. result, health care workers’ access personal protective equipment (PPE) infection control policies nursing homes received increased attention. However, known whether presence health care worker unions nursing homes associated COVID-19 mortality rates. Therefore, used cross-sectional regression analysis examine association presence health care worker unions COVID-19 mortality rates 355 nursing homes New York State. Health care worker unions associated 1.29-percentage-point reduction mortality, represents 30 percent relative decrease COVID-19 mortality rate compared facilities without unions. Unions also associated greater access PPE, one mechanism may link unions lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Two things bad time. one improves resources address other. bet lot stems stress pressure pandemic too. lot people supported trump supported opening getting people back work covid deaths I’m one people — inside since March actual lockdown due parents high-risk — much pain lonely. honestly appreciate acknowledgment people world seem care notice us. I... I... seriously fuck going on.

If doctor told monitor penis would tell pants on? bad got COVID infected RN despite never getting closer 6 feet wearing masks. building 8 hours day days end trumps measures people ignore symptoms even know contagious. horrible person care hundreds thousands deaths. completely agree, frustrating know science we're using Like, pharmacist then? know nurse like - full RN thats anti-vax take prescriptions. WTF That's ridiculous. free test yesterday SC. line 10 minutes. admin lady copied ID information asked contact number email. I'll results today tomorrow. 


It always easy. took rapid test urgent care right Christmas wait car 5 hours. August, free testing site took 45 minutes get through. it. know CDC's initial recommendation politicized Trump. There's trust. rates transmission high contract tracing work. county pro Trump anti mask health dept director, contract tracers pressure every parent identifying alternate routes kid could exposed. 

I'm willing convinced right data, seen yet. article noted higher covid rates among people schools, statistic can't get around. Yes correct mean reassuring sense transparent. Fake news pushed unions. According Canada 1.4% population vaccinated (edit: 1 shot) today, contracts 330% population vaccines? numbers highest county Missouri November December, 30%+ positivity rate school switched shorter quarantine times, stopped quarantining masked children, never quarantined anyone could justify never within six feet positive even sat class together day. call doctor lips turn blue

FFS tell possible check lips; doctor tell neighbors monitor lips

oh god stupid lot people lost year's salary gotten nothing return year. New York City testing method seems like pain ass anything. people right maybe. people left loathed Gates got philanthropy. Especially zero COVID risk lockdowns restrictions adds ton risk financially, socially, mentally.

I'm point glad America never *EU style ticket outdoors* lockdown. would fuming living one countries right now. goodness, someone finally honest admitting they've done?

&amp;#x200B;

I may faint. AZ selling cost, profiting.

They literally licensed vaccine Chinese, Indian Vietnamese manufacturers produce cost well. I’m happy got continue working without threat losing job unlike many others. eradication diseases took centuries. Smallpox took almost 500 years. That’s way. Expect worst, hope best. Why, often moon people driver-side window.  imagine universal healthcare...this article exist. People thinking reason Biden upped first 100 day estimate knows J&amp;J numbers vaccine looking really good feel bad 30% been. well 70% misled President sources Thank much explanation appreciate weird dichotomy going lot people next 3-5 months, IMO. I'd rather deal isolate whole time, might make case. Like vaccines, everyone comfort level tailor interaction. least, that's I've really need start coming telling people 100% safe never come vaccinated acceptable level risk 

Agreed. think want confirm spread significantly reduced vaccinated. hopefully shows soon, think good scientists start speaking up. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Moreover, everyone have, currently have, level risk. Covid serious, let's forget unreasonable apply analysis everyone situations. 

Some households going harder situations deal others. Taking sledgehammer everyone right method dealing that, indefinitely least. 

That said, I'm grateful mRNA vaccines. can't wait get one done this! hope do, too. implies safety issues vaccines? Heresy! vaccines 1000% safe. really good depth article Pfizer Moderna production posted reddit can't find now. 

If want short answer, basically create piece DNA SARS-CoV-2 spike protein coding sequence features (e.g. 5' 3' UTR, T7 promoter, polyA tail, etc.). use E coli bacteria amplify DNA produce large quantity template DNA. 

Then vitro transcription reaction T7 RNA polymerase enzyme uses DNA template produce many copies RNA. would need supply large quantities RNA nucleotide building blocks, case using N1-methyl-pseudouridine one four reduce innate immune system activation.

There also capping enzyme, believe article said vaccinia capping enzyme, used install 5' cap mRNA sequence. 

The resulting linear RNA sequence four thousand base pairs long, needs purified. 

Then purified RNA mixed several specialty lipids form lipid nanoparticles, probably fairly precise conditions. Moderna lipids are:

SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG],
cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC].

Then lipid nanoparticles dissolved pH-balanced solution filled vials.

Also article mentioned many steps done different facilities, might purified RNA transported whole facility gets mixed lipids, LNPs shipped fill finish plant put vials. like jabronis stockpiled toilet paper hopes making profit, want return month later. 

Idiots, all. language could clearer I'm interested see math? work pharma intense work ivermectin early primates saw literally nothing, didn’t pursue it. weren’t impressed clinical studies either, none well designed. bit hydroxychloroquine 2.0.

I suspect pharmas, it’s pursued. Spoiler alert: schools safe, government lying . Deaths baked drop. Today’s deaths early - mid December’s infections. Additionally likely 2 week period care somewhat rationed hardest hospital systems well dealing Covid surge first time somewhat learning fly. Michael Osterholm? He's literal Dr. Doom embarrassingly wrong past regarding viruses. 

Here ebola saying need 500 million vaccines. last scientist would listen regarding covid

## agree. That's romantic slightest. know, honestly wonder vaccines ever existed first place.  


Get someone mess inventory numbers, charge inventory really exist, one's wiser they're dealing last year's administration.  
Since US finally administration that's paying attention, suddenly 'missing vaccines' looked for...?  


\*disclaimer

THIS GUESS!! KNOW TRUE!  
 (But one things think would explain vaccines supposedly actually paid for, good reason yet still can't found. also exactly type grifting one would expect last year's US administration. would love wrong, vaccines found!) resistant making kind data public reason.

This reassuring. Europe one big fucking failure. lockdowns anywhere else, hospitals full anyways, fucking slow vaccinations. Tanning bed. think we’re lucky (light) conservatives fairly complacent comes voicing anti-science views, eventually throw hands surrender pressured right thing. Everywhere else seems double bad decisions. absolutely reason believe this. Asymptomatic carriers incredibly low attack rate, even households---and would baseline assumption infectiousness. I'm pointing out, do*mers sub constantly parrot thing, matter happening external world. still take time vaccines everyone. Yoots. It’s spelled yoots. god decision making roles.

Lol except people decision making roles think like them, we're situation begin with. Yeah financially disastrous. I'll lose mind hear Yoots “can” buy them, fringe. enough supply Ithaca much less whole country. know came hospital. don’t see go “not use” required one fell swoop. 

From FDA Respirators Use General Public
The Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) recommend general public wear N95 respirators protect respiratory diseases, including coronavirus (COVID-19). critical supplies must continue reserved health care workers medical first responders, recommended current CDC guidance. run company remote since inception nine years ago. interesting watching companies go realization sustainable without on-premise time.

Remote work great certain types work: coding, sales prospecting, calls, et cetera. 

In-person work great creativity, collaboration, building social capital inside business clients.

The ideal company mix both. Personally, like on-premise meetings, alone I'm grind. Hopefully companies allow workers flexibility. everyone forgets about! allowing kids back school asking new variant created. happens aren’t lucky current vaccines don’t protect new variant? Back square one! AZ selling profit. Oxford specifically chose AZ produce vaccine *because* AZ agreed sell cost. 
 key element Oxford’s partnership AstraZeneca joint commitment provide vaccine not-for-profit basis duration pandemic across world, perpetuity low- middle-income countries,” 
 
 
Feel good make things up? chuckle fucks 5G towers mole men theories? Looks like vaccines might moot.   schools area TN open since august: person home parents prefer. done contact tracing, classrooms get sent home, entire school. person kids back forth multiple times this. We’ve four teachers die covid. It’s clusterfuck. Yeah we're talking weight loss here, nutrition absorption. Obviously things like degree influence, nowhere near much ratio calories consumed calories burned Looks like vaccines might moot.  better getting updated Twitter. efficiacy better nothing, theres low risk try pandemic, trying things last year long teachers safe. parents 65 priority priority workers vaccines. Sure lower risk death could still end hospital long term issues. hope better. Yes 640 per 100,000 ""extremely high risk""? Says who? scientist doctor involved? high high? Like 1%, 10%, 80% chance? point metric also based amount testing done area varies widely. map adjust that?

Sorry complete nonsense.   enough vaccines go around.

If someone asked wanted get shot asap would say risk group.

Then reddit would label sociopathic abomination. Yea pretty redic me. Sorry hear brother stay safe really hope every last one prominent ""save economy"" people around entire world fully held account millions people needlessly died. point variants around since last year cared thought big issue vaccines came media needed new threat hype up. Negative news sells generates clicks way positive news. UK enough vaccines coming AstraZeneca vaccinate entire adult population. It’s 3 weeks Pfizer 4 weeks Moderna lot European politicians: many making threat / suggestion? need couple generate news sells. Yeah, staying caloric deficit literally weight lost. Idk people try deny fact Also coming work hungover lot cops busting small private gatherings now? least I'm from, going door door make sure everyone house allowed there. Maybe party 50 people, might. 

Also, already talk prove vaccinated. sure work, already talked about. never want hear put ""save Grandma.""

Totally ruined career, mental health, social health even get thank you. really, least state. kid creating unsafe environment students, go places resources better equipped handle them.

Assuming talking public schools. saw too. Infuriating. especially annoying colors stand subjective categories: ""low risk"" ""medium risk"" ""high risk"", etc. heat map that's actually displaying clear data all. I'm sure numbers behind it, entirely unclear mean different categories determine designations. county labeled ""extremely high risk"" fairly low covid cases year never hospital close overwhelmed patients. Many schools sided loud parents staff, creating safety concerns. Sadly, often schools are/were run, even pre-Covid. case EU contract could pursue damages, guess EU plants beign awarded EU. 

AZ plants, they're CMOs weve known 8 months, talking ivermectin long haul group 8 months ago, slow   weve known 8 months, talking ivermectin long haul group 8 months ago, slow Damn, seem really angry discernable reason! fun lol temporary solution kids able communicate online via phone/FaceTime. 

I say mother homeschooled child lots activities friends “regular” times zero problems adjusting pandemic. Basically. live rural area, people take seriously, also understand life goes on. big anti-mask movement rural areas like everybody thinks. rural schools small populations students. study nothing compared urban school even suburban school 25-30 students classroom 500-1000 students building. recovered Covid. infectious disease doc says CDC reliable giving public accurate information start run economists actual people practice medicine.   Except Israel studies showed 0.01% vaccinated people caught virus vaccinated. no, positive news isn’t allowed No, shouldn't. done part pre-vaccination. Ain't problem post-vaccination. don’t know nice alarming. press briefings back.. yay? 

""Hey vaccines wear mask, people die, blah blah blah."" shit repeat week week. Unless something new develops like South African variant worse ebola giant circle jerk. ""Her der, look I'm TV."" Substantially nursing home residents inoculated within weeks. plenty worry young people spending days working vaccinated patients. ""Extremely high"", compared what? Seems like NYT making new metric report bad news.

[This defines county’s Covid-19 risk level primarily based number cases reported per capita past two weeks. Additional precautions suggested 10 percent tests positive result past two weeks available county extremely high risk level reported 640 cases per 100,000 people past two weeks. county fewer cases may also category 10 percent tests positive result past two weeks. mean county testing enough, number cases may undercounted. 60% without knowing days first delivery weird sign management failure. 60% without knowing days first delivery weird sign management failure.  never 100% safe, stupid pointless try it. patients vaccinated (very soon, like within weeks), seeing caretakers, family, friends, healthcare workers. importance spread, even inoculated, things spread, virus hits dead end dead end. 

If want spend time worrying tiny fraction might get it, fraction people refuse vaccine, among fraction people exposed, fun that. point better worrying lightning strikes.  going back 2 weeks, district told us parents don’t need notify us child tested positive exposed due HIPAA violations. Like makes sense could argue \~1 week anticipated approval(and therefore delivery) 

UK get doses delivered soon vaccine approved. fucking fuel anti-Vaxxers. media know better possibly drag even longer.

Im really looking forward people shouting waiting Herd immunity bunch idiot antivaxers. masks used firework fuses?

Asking friend doesnt come price? GOP dipsh*** passed it. sincerely hope drop dead Covid. deserve it. easy take advantage strategic benefits instead acting like there's nothing could done, yes. Ohio. mask mandate 10:00 curfew, basically 90% business usual live. kids go school everyday, local movie theater open, restaurants open full capacity, etc. work outside home everyday, spent 1 day home. barely even notice pandemic exists anymore.

Also, local covid numbers low manageable. gonna hit different boomers go ""millenials, stop whinging eating avocado toast financial glory""  Kids sick class? kind 3rd world country still sending kids school? someone explain massive difference doses given people received second dose? know it’s 3 weeks two. 19 million difference US? going year strong every season. I'm afraid know talking about.  Depressing... UK got vaccines produced EU well. EU‘s policy every country fair access limited vaccine supply. 
So EU allows exporting vaccines produced EU UK, Canada, Japan countries. 
So whenever vaccine vendor production problems, expects reduced volume also distributed across receiving countries. god, friend. don’t want see *more* people caskets. documented “superspreader” events funerals. wear mask times working. plenty legitimate N95 masks available public USA months. initial shortage mostly supply chain issue largely resolved. big hospitals wanted work familiar supply companies whereas smaller companies sometimes sectors able quickly pivot obtain small quantities (relatively speaking) respirators. 

I know running website help people disabilities chronic illnesses find N95 masks since beginning pandemic. lot people still don’t know anybody buy them, hospitals, sadly believe causing unnecessary illness death. since beginning, knew home care workers would need medical masks suddenly Amazon blocked sales N95s. look alternatives that’s started business. 

Cloth masks fine cover medical mask, alone, really good enough protect crowded indoor situations. Even imperfectly fit N95 going better give protection people wearing mask noses hanging such.

I actually trust respirators Amazon less ones suppliers. It’s easy list fake products Amazon. Especially KN95s, poorly regulated people trying pass fakes ones received EUA. Quality KN95 masks great bad ones practically useless.

Considering difficult get Americans wear mask all, don’t think requiring respirators would work USA. anytime someone asks kind mask wearing, tell N95 masks, KN95 masks really can’t stand head straps. really matter. Everyone pretty much avoiding bars anyway since close 8 they're allowed let limited number people time. Godzilla vs Kong save theaters? Yet could still spread disease. Vaccination isnt proven stop person person transmission Even reduce transmission non insignificant margin (remains seen), reduction may well negated (by definition asymptomatic thus carefree) behaviour vaccinated individuals.

I'm sure we'll agree past year proven various states, companies international organisations make made various irresponsible, hasty counter-intuitive decisions. may well article LITERALLY proves that, rather disproving I'm saying. Zealand Vietnam beating Taiwan

Literally how? Taiwan COVID-free far longer NZ, fewer deaths, never needed internal lockdown. They've also far humble whole thing, spite insulted right next door China.

On hand, nice see Rwanda Iceland getting much-needed credit success. sick tired people acting like NZ mitigation approach worth imitating. understand logic behind people thinking US vaccine rollout bad. aspect response top line.

We vaccinating, average, entire population Philadelphia, every day. And, we're one month vaccine rollout. Could better? Sure. countries going waiting much longer vaccine. We'll vulnerable population vaccinated end April. Absolutely everyone basically pulling facts asses keep contradicting lol Absolutely everyone basically pulling facts asses keep contradicting lol god, friend. don’t want see *more* people caskets. One good parts damn disease. never slept life. Lot time back commuting. vaccine sold cost. like $2 pop. one stealing it, sell profit. picked nice round number marketing purposes. already increased goal [150 probably revise upwards becomes clear he'll better.

He also knows people real fast pillory meeting goal sets, may well take victory available give L everyone else waiting give one anyway.

People also act like Trump acting vacuum, Biden [announced going voila, [Trump admin exactly 4 days Nevermind Trump apparently [already that, unbeknownst even vaccine sold cost. like $2 pop. one stealing it, sell profit. sub tolerate anyone hopes progress. Especially it’s fulfill desires travel. want doom gloom. want world locked know everything every permutation 10000% certainty. almost like lockdowns work certain point.  guy need grow fuck up. Antimaskers also humans. know sure spreading without vaccines. Even vaccines help little spread, though it’s likely little, it’s improvement. COURSE want vaccine ASAP.

We get vaccine ASAP. guess we're still mostly holed wearing masks next Fall earliest. Next Spring mostly woods back 90% ""normal."" I'm optimist. should, lots countries require vaccines diseases big deal like state. Let alone else countries need especially USA western world let in, even official guides middle east countries.

 Countries working hard implement now, people companies confidence, fraud protection implemented, reduce black market. drive testing country going hilarious.....

Turning head 90 degrees towards open window easy comparison. 3 letter organizations fda cdc put like feds school decided next week time return. God help us. justification. counter argument. That's matters, that's problem.

A breach contract EU contract breach contract, matter reason breach is. European standpoint matter supersedes it. you’re scared number people experienced issues vaccine wait hear many people died COVID. Yeah, either way smells fishy. joke? said needed 500 million vaccines Ebola back 2014. know dude go ripping mask stores quite yet okay, nobody ever took seriously enough get essential workers sick really shows feel ""heroes"" kept country running lockdown

Edit: Literally killing working poor get cheetos haircuts, fucking scumbags There’s never 100% safe vaccine, though. kids know hide coughs symptoms screening process joke purple hand thermometers always show temperature. People generally believe alcoholism (or drinking everyday) curable. true new treatment based repurposed drug Baclofen. Quitting drinking easy taking pill. 

An Australian dr good web site it: www.baclofentreatment.com understand people mean say *I'm going XYZ* we're back normal *this time year*... government barely anything anyway want able things without worrying becoming carrier. dependent amount people vaccinated nothing else. Yes, EU trying block pfizer exports countries outside block. missing would swine flu give false positive antibodies? totally different virus (influenza). Nothing wrong vaccine simply argument AZ cutting EU deliveries Q1. I’m getting second shot 9:30 next Tuesday.

It’s fucking terrible :( going pernickity, aids spread all. interesting links, thank posting them. early messaging covid clearly dangerous one know dangerous stuck, latch mysterious “long term effects” long haulers common I’ll avoid vaccine least enough people vaccinated get herd immunity. Takes 3 weeks vaccination build immunity. could well case AZ signed incompatible contracts UK EU.

Instead, suggest parents get tested. effect cooking county numbers looks like nearly children entire school year, yet there's hundreds. also strongly discourage teachers getting tested well suggest stay home think symptoms don't, district suggests teacher continue working. absolutely unethical. Going need source this.

Thankfully, it’s day though, make sure clear schedules accordingly could think Idiocracy health machine scene...this anal swab test...ohh opps oral swab Great news, that's true many states, South Dakota example. I’m healthcare worker.
I supposed go vacation March.
What point?
I’m fine.
It’s immature think need go beach, beach vacation.
I’m rich either ridiculously privileged right people can’t pay rent.
I live Minnesota go park us outdoorsy types travel North stay cabins.
If you’re Midwestern might understand us already since March. EU trying block Pfizer exports outside bloc, wants AZ export UK contracted doses sovereign state?! missing something  N95s mostly banned USA. KN95s allowed. Good. understand concerns, understand point life going get worse everytime there's good news tbh find anything, whole investigation 1 year cacophony show world something China Innocent. Kyriakides: 'The view company obliged deliver signed best effort agreement neither correct acceptable. reject logic first come first served.'

Seems EU different interpretation contract, really can't know unless see (the EU said release AZ agrees, presumably due NDA). think they'll calm rational vaccination rate up, deaths down, multiple hysterical news stories day. not, well, ever come long try force everyone else stay inside well. study months ago said cloth masks 40-60% effective face shields 4% effective. ChapoTrapHouse website now? Go there. question. understanding appears kids don’t spread virus often don’t show symptoms therefore rarely get tested, get tested someone family don’t get marked index case weren’t first person test positive. would love see data school system students faculty tested every week. that? fucking worthless listened someone vested interest chose ignore actual scientist? Palm Beach county population 1.5 million

Publix locations Palm Beach County 67

Daily vaccines/Publix= 50  50x67=3350 vaccines /day

Number days administer 3 million vaccines = 895 2.5 years. 

Does one government calculator?  Thought handle anxiety OCD 2019. Ended back therapy 2020. Wtf, read not? people wrote article scientist, question doctors tested positive getting vaccine, implying tested positive got vaccinated. even know got vaccine first place. I’m sorry hear that. don’t see fiancé dying anytime soon estate isn’t vast enough issue anyway. don’t home together nothing joint, I’m gonna alright dies.

If courthouse now, know I’m gonna enough drive plan reception. proof vaccine won’t cause someone get covid making claim? Yep I’ve seen pretty outrageous road rage occasions I’ve gone out. People gotten meaner, general.

I doubt lot political civil chaos we’ve seen last 6-7 months exasperated pandemic talking verbally, actual physically beating head chair type thing? actually opposite. least apartment complex. people would hardly say hi lol. interesting see happens compromise even reached? Nuclear option EU surprised would block Pfizer vaccines leaving EU block make Vaccine shortfall. Took real realize this. Amazing journalism. 🤣 people read say, “What’s whole point then? even get vaccinated?” 

We need provide many incentives possible encourage people get vaccinated. strategy backfire. mask social distance 2022 then?  Well EU demand same. AZ, Pfizer Moderna (they manufactured EU)

For example Norway received delivery schedule AZ deliver 1.1 million doses February, claim deliver 200,000 July - delivering millions countries many doses coming EU plants. 

If happened US AZ would go way deliver time. I’m happy EU showing muscles. course may right, ever helped someone selflessly surely experienced lift gives (so maybe selfless buzz?!), imagine happiness would give know played major part ridding world polio example. I'm never convinced argument many people spend 50 years life something people remember they're dead.

However, successfully pretend good person long, point actually become good? Everyone full stop. Young people still spread virus young people still get permanent organ damage it. Federal government's ability use spending power force states take certain actions broadly defined. could stipulate receive federal funding schools need mask mandate. Granted states could simply forgo federal funding since education largely funded state level lot poorer states that's good chunk money. 

For instance, States ability set drinking age whatever want. order receive federal highway funds roads must set minimum drinking age 21. Every state wanted federal highway money every state eventually complied. awful article. Getting vaccine cause test positive. Thats antivax bs right sure hope reuse swab, confuse tests. well-informed person said would Easter 2020 way thing lasts years. I'm predicting pretty normal Summer US, going fucking glorious. Exactly. Also union workers make better benefits. employers recruit retain best employees. Nope. happening. total downer, fiance's logic rescheduled wedding back March, retrospect, really wish we'd done quickie courthouse ceremony right away, followed proper reception things back normal.

Things absolute legal clusterfuck since fiance died unexpectedly summer legal rights came dealing estate since married. think Boris might able tell surprisingly UK company reducing vaccine deliveries EU 60%. Doctors stupid average person. They’ve studied one specific thing long time. is. Concrete obligations trump promises. 

Everything reasonable power include breaking concrete earlier contracts. Trudeau probably one worst leaders crisis. Indecisive, meek concerned image actual effectiveness action. Yeah stress level reasonable estimates I've seen indoor concerts reopening US Fall 21. think that's surety yet people bitching CTU looking members. means THE. FUCKING. NOSE. Bill Gates, billionaires, rich, truly evil people, one comes mind people Bill Gates?! Seriously? Well better face shields n95s notice think time. alone almost over. ❤️ claim this? always remember hearing promises production numbers end 2021 never remember hearing anyone promise massive deliveries early 2021. significant fraction Covid problems really due air travel, would see Covid clusters higher infection rates wealthier neighborhoods, affluent enough travel.

Instead seeing Covid clusters high infection rates low income neighborhoods - places average low-income resident may often (or ever) travel air. Look counties country situation same.

The travel testing 100% politics optics - stopping measurable fraction Covid cases. ignored obvious, parents like stuck home kids. lots top hospitals huge biotech community. one getting reelected lose parents voting block. adequate supply everyone get those? Yeah, clear obvious bad idea school, virtually everyone wears masks. good ten percent I’ve seen wears nose. social distancing absolutely nonexistent. bomb threat yesterday evacuate temporarily, funneling back grounds teacher said “remember distancing!!” we, 200+ whatever us flow three foot wide gate. Yeah, okay. Thanks trying. Don’t even get started hallways, classrooms, stairs. mention pathetic plastic cardboard tri-folds desks. don’t even cover length width desks, people sit outside coverage area, effectively making useless. teacher even admitted weren’t protecting us.

Stupid idea open schools. Incomprehensibly so. I’d think pharmacies Publix’s (especially low income areas), live Florida, sooo... know, god’s waiting room bit true. Maybe places don’t CVS every corner? Haha feel pain, though get delicious dairy queen ice cream cake year hit spot misunderstanding. High cycle PCR tests cannot distinguish active infectious virions residual dead nucleotides. I.e. much like antibody tests, PCR test positive people *had previously infected*, might actually active infection time.

And contrary claim, positive PCR test *by itself* considered sign active infection, loads people getting tested absent symptoms due contact tracing, job requirements, caution prior travel, medical procedures, like. EU fund development Oxford vaccine. paid upfront manufacturing doses advance. AZ told could expect deliveries much would delivered. AZ suddenly said: Screw you, deliver 60%.

So EU asking AZ fulfil contractual obligations. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* that's unreasonable tbh. Apollo 17 people started asking tf still it, stopped. Lol warehouse job ignoring safety social distancing wiping shifts nothing thing temp scans masks know hate ""the media"" threads, NY Times daily podcast today also likely declines we're seeing permanent vaccine rollout ramping up. what’s efficiacy? potential risk, vaccine become effective immune system puts fight whatever That's likely going happens. doubt a/z approved US. Europe mostly end non-MRNA vaccines probably mainly AZ dud Novavax trial widely seen high potential... said potential right now. ordered 100 million AZ doses probably move needle EU much no, large part point ffp2 masks fit MUCH better. they're tighter clean shaven face (or one need shaved first place) create seal mask visibly (and viscerally) sticks face inhale.

yes extra layers too, fit important aspect little ""leakage"" around edges aren't. can't speak them, generally speaking think that's problem. Conservatives embrace authority generally. authority figures told distrust liberals, scientists, data/evidence following order.

I don' know medical term it... would maybe call Narrative Reality Disorder.

You form (or fed) narrative bend everything fit narrative. Sort like confirmation bias.. reject everything see contradicts narrative recognize fits twist fit. technically potential risk, although I'd imagine basically anywhere, people administering vaccines first gotten vaccinated themselves. disagree. catch every single person positive? course not. prevent people positive flying otherwise would have? Yes, will. rapid test, could easily false negative

Sure, even low end estimates rapid test accuracy 80 percent. means 80 percent people positive take rapid test able board plane. huge improvement PCR test, time get results could already gotten infected progressed enough current infection test positive

Also true, prevent people definitely positive tested positive flying. Preventing people flying meaningful impact, even small percentage people contract take makes much sense limit number passengers plane, make wear masks, anyone headache, stuffy nose, sore throat, needs stay home

This would prevent measures happening. agree every single point make here. limiting number passengers plane, make everyone wear masks, prevent people symptoms flying. also think require recent negative test top measures. None measures 100 percent effective, one lowers odds person COVID spread people plane. decrease odds fewer transmissions be. Holy fuck 17 would promote give bonus. studies Europe early pandemic seemed indicate benefit. panned stuff worked, would nice stock midst pandemic.

Of course, small scale studies, results proven positive dead end. stupid attention span gnat (i.e. POTUS) hear ""chloroquine may work"" think ""miracle cure!"" ""gut"" tells thats /s.  Within short time Trump's announcements chloroquine, follow studies showing promising all. say good chance no. Rates transmission lowering vaccine campaign rolling out. mention adjust differences population even close. sub loves fear mongering 
There’s way ban articles baffled made feel crazy lack information receiving. know right extensive misinformation campaign history COVID everything else. truly makes feel crazy Democrat governor CDC saying things add up. want kids school March cite negative impact home (which, duh!? solution get shit asap cooperation, aka, option).

 meantime, saying vaccinate teachers , seem ignore kids go home parents? And, flying face know kids notorious inability practice great hygiene keep likelihood spreading disease, say kids suffering this. would awesome, would think would still concerned spreading kids home adults would fantastic knew kids would fine. don't, know terrifying percentage asymptomatic cases end extensive lung scarring. however find information relating screening lungs kids asymptomatic seem otherwise unaffected. talking things? see headlines find scant outdated info. 

I get dems dealing politicized, meantime impact disinformation confusion. Fuck. enough make wonder fucking conspiracy nothing adding up. (I know not, know response politicization, making fucking crazy leaving us confused less informed already novel virus) Grandma killers lmao top that, messed deliveries second dose participants Phase 3 trial, spun ""it works regardless second dose 4 weeks 12 weeks"".

Oh wasn’t aware that, mention still published updated results trial. preliminary results December available public.

AFAIK, regulators like MHRA still receiving data trials constant basis. (Forgive ignorance this) matter data public long right people receiving it? honest, maybe US consider giving AstraZ vaccines. vaccine seems like dud anyways (only 70% effective according trials, Germany Israel reporting efficacies much lower that). focus giving everyone Moderna/Pfizer/Johnson&amp;Johnson. Exactly. Wow definitely showing pretty great creativity keeping message negative even facts positive. looking Amazon. 95% KN95. agree you, least open earlier also Sundays. Before, groceries closed Sunday France. One could argue ~1 week anticipated approval(and therefore delivery) soon reasonably possible.

Has public statement happened? know Commission published information, that's thing. Still better swabbing smallest one! sister's ex-husband. Whenever thinks intelligence questioned someone suggesting generally logical solution something, oh boy. Unhinged talking smart he's engineer. Like, yeah, sure, mean qualified ounce landscaping. sure heck qualified tell kids covid real. Yeah. Thankfully got one ironed out. Ugh. sure taking about, peak second wave started decreasing couple weeks now. clear trending right direction vaccinate people (albeit lower rate). seen contract? Best effort quote CEO, could language clarify best effort is. Yeah bad science real thing say like voter turnout country isn’t 55% best. would buy book whole bizarre episode. SA vaccines made SII now.

UK actually export vaccines yet, they've explicitly stated UK production go UK citizens first. I'd wish EU would priorities citizens too. UK US it, EU sure too. It’s weird EU demanded AstraZ make public contract confirm firm commitment vs best endeavors. Couldn’t EU simply release contract themselves? It’s bit fishy. based Reddit, Europeans seem believing government done nothing wrong here. 

In event, vaccines aren’t available don’t know EU expects happen.  couple thoughts. 

In tweet 3 document says ""In case delays anticipated availability product , contractor aims allocate doses product fairly across demand doses, contractor contractually commit towards present future customers, doses become available"".

Could interpreted way fully fulfilling orders UK cutting 60% deliveries EU, fairly allocating doses(like population)?

In tweet 4 document says ""If delay supply product compared estimated delivery schedule contractor inform commission soon reasonably possible"".

One could argue \~1 week anticipated approval(and therefore delivery) soon reasonably possible.  Whoa didn’t even know they’re removed it, didn’t see single piece media coverage that. feels good you, advise keep Germany least, children 6 fully exempt mask reqs. Loved last time went market kid cough me. sinopharm vaccine uses inactivated live virus, ""update"" shot, need inactivate mutant virus deliver that. Spudnik adenovirus delivering DNA instead RNA, update pretty much updating Moderna/pfizer - dna instead None variants resist vaccine . I've kinda asked before, really gotten clear answers. So, get vaccine, person giving Covid, people building/store/pharmacy, hospital/etc. Covid, could still get sick even though got vaccine? potential risk? ask heard vaccine takes several weeks start working, supposedly. correctly you’d lucky students surprising, similar reports I've seen elsewhere.

I think everyone agrees keeping schools open paramount importance-- question factor health safety in.

We 2 choices keeping schools open:

1) whatever takes keep schools open. 

Everyone, children not, could reduced social interactions, followed guidelines masks sanitizing, stopped going bars, parties, dine-in restaurants, gabbing friends, etc. Design effective school safety programs, including modifying air handling systems, reducing class sizes migration students/teachers building. Design effective, affordable, realistic method testing enabling quarantining/isolation testing positive. 

Schools would open, everyone would reasonably safe.

OR

2) whatever takes keep schools open.

Don't ask anyone outside school employees actually make adjustments concessions lifestyle. give schools money resources make work safely. Put schools absolutely bottom list considerations except demanding open.

  Change definitions risk factors: Move goalposts, ignore run space move them. test, claim there's problem. Define terms obvious problems become 'obviously problems'. Hide data. share data get stuck despite best attempts none interested parties, including parents, teachers, taxpayers. Ignore fact even children likely get seriously sick die, mean teachers, teachers families, student's families, school workers families, get seriously sick die.

Schools would open, one would reasonably safe.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It seems many areas chosen second method whatever takes keep schools open.  Quite frankly, nobody survive another summer without tourism. Thank God vaccine, otherwise we'd really tough choices make guidelines apply hospitals. sister nurse co-worker tested positive wearing masks, need sister quarantine. Sounds like personal problem. requiring person attendance, get paid daily amount student attends, cost schools open now. enough advance, 3 months behind everyons elses investment orders. UK also paid set-up manufacturing plants summer last year, took months work kinks get going. EU expects European plants work 100% despite months behind* hope everyone forget missed early orders back queue.

*And set-up French manufacturer far bungled every Covid task given it. soon US cases started decline, NY Times switched case count map (I guess getting scary enough), ""risk getting COVID map"" that's almost 'extremely high.' hope see hear crazy public freakouts this. think masks stay around Memorial Day. So, 3-4ish months. Wow always amazed many international vaccine contracts distribution experts reddit. Amazing. top that, messed deliveries second dose participants Phase 3 trial, spun ""it works regardless second dose 4 weeks 12 weeks"". 


Not mention still published updated results trial. preliminary results December available public. Idk that. I’m legal medical expert could imagine workplaces could require vaccination. know ""strawman"" even is. know life important 85yr old years left live. cold, harsh truth many people thinking willing admit say. No. Lots sellers legit N95 masks sale, including eBay Amazon legitimate news magazine education first published 1910. article would normally categorized ""blog"". I'll get COVID, thanks! anyone studies many days people could infect others first symptoms? you’re masks likely required currently required either see massive drops hospitalizations /cases vast majority people access vaccine. nearing herd immunity it’s best keep wearing masks public places, work, etc. I’m first guy want get rid masks it’s safe majority people vaccinated. Also depends context. outside masks aren’t necessary. top stores can’t start allowing masks vaccinations people haven’t vaccinated take advantage that. Masks us till least summertime imagine. Yup, parents. cant even send kids back school due chronic illness limit many exposures possible. literally convinced d00mers believe this'll last way 2022 sounds like cool year... issue there’s contingencies way down. fired half teachers, double class sizes. fire every teacher, sorta devalue teaching license subsequently lower salaries. replace public schools private charter schools. There’s plan fuck teachers every step way. example Pfizer/BioNTech since BioNTech/Germany supply majority funding (came US) + Pfizer HQ'ed US. EU keep Pfizer/BioNTech doses watned again, mostly American vaccine due funded. BioNTech partnered Pfizer they're small company resources produce vaccine themselves. Also Pfizer's vaccine produced Belgium, Belgium one many production hubs. 

But EU stop export Pfizer vaccines produced Belgium. might nice thing do, something consider. EU two option, take high road, nice let vaccines shared amongst countries be, put citizens first parasite world like US keep vaccines inside borders.

It's vaccine significantly Germany EU received minimal investments US part operation warp speed. Also technology comes European country developed Europe German company HQ'ed Germany. one major production plants, supplying lot countries, EU too.

Also completely disagree forcing AstraZeneca using foreign production supply meet European demand. think pretty reasonable chance AstraZeneca meet ""best effort"" agreement notify EU time. Let's honest, 60% delivery cut EU significant completely fault AstraZeneca due extreme incompetence getting facilities ready production. even get close promised amounts, months preparation hundred millions front investment get ready. couple percent couple dozen even, understand, missing 59 million vaccines suddenly shows extreme incompetence AstraZeneca. Also somehow happened suddenly one week approval months preparation hundred millions euros front investment production facilities. warnings one announce might cut deliveries. also communications they've extremely incompetent even worse, basically fraudulent (if kept quiet lied). blame EU incompetence disgusting complete incompetence AstraZeneca. specific case one guilty incompetent party: AstraZeneca. honestly care selling cost price. Maybe price low, selling cost price, incompetence cannot bought. ways, suddenly makes problems doctors knee make sense. Five years one even imaging sent specialist could barely walk. Knee pain? Take ibuprofen. physical therapy. tendinitis. Ha. torn meniscus, patella pushed wrong place, issue forget absolutely tendinitis. States like Texas, Florida, Arizona going laugh way bank people take trips experience ""normal life"" vaccinated. People already vaccinated imagine tourism going gangbusters ""open"" states months. live Illinois kind hope slowly reopening Chicago knows can't survive another summer without tourism. think thats need strawman burn.

Just people whining minor sacrifices mean bummed out. idea Mexican president flies commercial. Seems would dangerous many heads state. mean, giving pretty good example ""real world"" unfortunately. Yes EU huge mess run 2nd rank politicians could complete national politics member states. Yet, comes vaccine distribution point. boiling inside see EU get 17 million doses July, 150 million scheduled delivered couple days ago. Fair point. seem distributing faster mainland europe, slower uk. Exactly! mention classes still packed brim, see buses drive road completely filled. asinine . month UK government decided extend gap first second jabs Covid-19 vaccines three 12 weeks ensure maximum inoculation soon possible, Britain’s “first doses first” policy remains outlier global terms. UK’s decision prompted widespread concern might weaken immune response two marketed vaccines use groundbreaking mRNA technology made BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna. countries sticking manufacturers’ recommendations specify three four-week interval, though shifting policy toward permitting six-week gap. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Antibody levels peak 1-2 weeks second dose. likely recieve 4 million , 530,00 January 4 million slated end 2020.

Source: note difference vaccien manufactured facility EU, vaccine manufactured intended used EU.   EU bitchy can't get want.

I would say act distraction badly mishandled vaccines ordering. large part half want vaccine positive results starting show. Actually think it’s good demand restricted skepticism groups. everyone wanted would chaos. whatever reason people widely skeptical vaccines. think necessarily outspoken, whacko Facebook-spamming anti-vaxxers quietly want take it.

Yeah thanks saying least lol. think sub likes strawman vaccine skeptic/wait type Facebook spamming anti vaxxers like said. People rush. 

Also report october 2020... I'd like see survey now. Situation pretty massively different vaccine wise imo. sure situation sorted legally

Generally would render later contract void vender liable, although anything big worldwide vaccine contract ever legally tested way!

in case EU contract could pursue damages, guess EU plants beign awarded EU. legalities would take years sort out.

For bit legality fun EU threat cut vaccine UK ordered expects could considered war crime terms

If 5% chance getting covid interaction (which don't), chance getting 5 interactions 1-(.95)^5 23%. - number right either that's works. option stay home are. know kids struggling remote learning, see various mass emails daughter's teacher pleading parents make sure kids school work shows kids big concern adults. Reopening schools essentially giving tact approval people everything fine. I'm sure New York Times wants ""new normal"" vast majority people want live lives again. instances yet people vaccinated ending hospitals. Obviously hasn’t long since people received it. wonder see instances vaccinated people ending hospitalized due covid. imagine happen eventually far less unvaccinated population got sick soon receiving second dose. Thousands restaurants New England closed. awful. Ding ding ding Maybe good thing. I'm expert approaching infamous ""herd immunity""? 30% Americans already Covid, good thing? think time ""let rip"" re-open everything completely. California good example do. Everything Gov. Newsom Mayor's seems made situation worse. ""Let Rip!!!""  Stay home youre scared give dates. \*waves hand. Why? took active internal campaign involved fact sheets posters employees getting shots persuade 80 percent staff vaccinated, Green comes communicating workers, it’s information matters, delivered, said Grabowski, Harvard professor. “Webinars FAQs” going effective, said, conversation trusted source.  Thanks thoughts. Again, much appreciate summary above. I'm really wondering US actually use AZ vaccine. could see offering countries -- maybe Mexico Canada, promote overall health region. We're obviously going impacted spread covid everywhere world, disproportionately neighbors share border. anyone website find overview vaccines development stage/target population/other details?
Thanks 🙏🏼 think right people fully vaccinated, makes sense expect vaccinated people publicly follow regulations rubbing everyone else's faces.

But go wild imo Many fellow teachers considering leaving teaching post-pandemic. job market improves think wave younger mid-career educators opting change fields. happened city. upsetting. whole industry collapsing. sooooo bad omg bad vaccine eradicate stupidity.

There is, EU order enough it. /s I'd say week second shot go thing. fine. time stop charade masks enough? simple solution? make things complicated? Dr. Shaman Would able share here? Sounds crazy principal would constitute mask wearing child abuse official communication parents. 🙁 okay going back gym. nervous go lot people pick gym that's good precautions really doubt even go far vaccinated. * mandating two masks *yet*

I've seen people area wearing two. remember started, people started *willingly* wearing masks local government saw everyone wearing mandated them. 

So I'm getting sense deja vu people *willingly* wearing two. Feel sorry kids quote particular got weeks following, thought frequently people missed without fully realizing it. Pretty good friends mostly done things longer possible, trying new restaurants together. Co-workers didn’t know well chatted communal kitchen. **Workers local coffee sandwich shops could longer dawdle chat.** depth intensity relationships varied greatly, people all, capacity, friends, also substitute pandemic. Tools like Zoom FaceTime, useful maintaining closer relationships, couldn’t re-create ease social serendipity, bring back activities bound us together.

I remember back April often thought guy coffee shop knew order complimented haircut whenever changed. shop since closed (temporarily? indefinitely? knows) wonder happened him, whether found another job, even lives nearby anymore. would really ask cardiologist this. Random people Reddit aren’t going able give good advice kind thing. anecdote acceptable others? I’m one “those” states plenty healthcare workers refused vaccine.

(Middle school choir teacher Texas) entered true lockdown last week. rules mandatory curfews 1pm 5am weekends 23pm 5am weekdays. weekends also forbidden travel cities.

During Christmas restrictions lifted (no mandatory curfews restrictions Inter-city travel). relied good behavior population backfired. even restrictions made much difference restrictions NYE dinner parties still occurred. Don’t strike then, better Chicago Teachers Union, literally probably never work lmao I'd wait 2-3 weeks takes get fully 95% immunity fine Kn-95 masks dollar available lot stores U.S. short durations, seems like brainier people wear. think government buy send people. Idk negative tests mandatory. think issues availability everything make tests then? ""charity work"" billionairesIve hearing much lieu taxed forcing pay taxes? I've attitude since summer large part trash articles like this. Nah 1 dollar enough convince someone bring someone reusable mask make waste. work students around age, irresponsible forgetful. Many would take advantage take new mask every day. buy make mask literally dollars, excuse. vaccines prove effective, think we're looking good (Old) Jersey. worry new variants seems gone, coming second wave, I'm saying cautious optimism life semi normal mid-March fully normal summer (maybe travel rules). Fellow high school kid here. I'm boat. lockdown days best days life 2020 also included worst day life. long masking you/your family high risk, strongly encourage research enjoyable hobby attempt expand social circle. next months things going ease. Hang there. let's play out. Like HCOVs, one continue mutate forever. What's end-game here?  It’s supposed free child care abused one... yes yes Sounds like EU fucked vaccine dithering. nice every country world getting AZ approved except (before) EU US? Israel using Pfizer AZ iirc Looking advice here. several heart problems I’ve isolating since beginning pandemic. Next week receive second dose Moderna. I’ve gained close 20 pounds year I’ve itching go back gym. guys think I’m fine going back second shot would advise waiting months see cases really go down? seen double opposite. said thing you.  could send lawyers copy contract.

The fact want contract released 'find it' (they know, signed it) - want use force AZ release UK/AZ contract dig around find whether legal argument take away doses UK production plants. Haha facts possible? vaccines going strong now, start ease off? missing something? funny think giving examples ""the side"" delusional, fake boogeyman positions delusion. Nobody believed 0 deaths ever option. Shutdowns prevent hospital overruns. prevent Covid deaths, also ensure people needed non-covid related hospital care would able get it. 

I'm sure I'll regret asking.. ""Sooner""? thought someone attended Oklahoma University. trump admin falsified CDC info. deliberately lied Biden transition team. new admin needs kick lying trump toadies get real people back there. going take time. sadly it. wife teacher. kids went back full classrooms. Day 2, covid case. It'll miracle family survives summer. depend outrageously slow, bureaucratic organ called EU. business.

Isn't participation optional? Like Britain approved first vaccine still EU rules. feel like Brexit probably meant every country like ""We need show unity works"". Meanwhile, right wing news sources peddling stuff like problem lockdowns hard lockdown actually effective (Wuhan, NZ, etc.) half measure lockdown harm good. pressure put manufactures globally increase production n95s. think people would wear readily available less expensive.  way too! FEB 20 UNITE! pretty impossible get kids follow kinds rules. Think hallways, lunch, bathroom, school, etc. That's always pissed off. Like, sure, classroom supervision Timmy lifted mask funny? serious consequences that? send office? huge party kids house parents require masks? supposed feel safe come back school? Like...ugh. intense accountability, feel like shit would change. Schools afraid intense. Even he's right absolutely cautious people say ""Fuck it"" even things worse. 50% plus already said fuck back April 2020, people would get stricter concept cant comprehend anyone thinks people would Correct I'm wrong, iirc Germany buy majority EU's vaccine doses earmarked supposed go member states, Germany barged in, happily broke EU's vaccine procurement process without second thought put ahead EU members, screwing over. much EU solidarity. Statistically kids very, little risk Covid. role almost exclusively potential Same. hard find beginning, since became available masks I've wearing. lot Exactly, increasing supply allow happen. People generally already understand n95s closer wearing, begin buy naturally prices normalize I'm pretty sure they're saying lives people living gone back normal, specifically treating virus badly. Probably soon maybe within next month two. IIRC israel providing data pfizer. think already give early data indicating stops transmission. they'll probably provide data time goes on. Kinda makes wonder Hawaii plan is... Chapos largely infested subs like r/politics, r/news even r/business oddly enough. teachers? stupid fucking logic. Yep point agree. starting actually go away we're still nowhere near ending vaccine. We'd looking another one one half years probably 💯 That's month half away, seriously? takes 2 weeks J&amp;J get approved, vaccine timeslots already filled February liberal city. Tl;dr: scared anything. you’re already scared scared.  don’t disagree. think we’ve something like 12 days person instruction since last March (we briefly went hybrid looks great paper reality WORST).
I think Covid brought lot issues regarding equity forefront one really knows deal that. know parents district would lose minds one school went back another one didn’t. There’s already mass exodus private schools afford it.
It’s hot mess around Thanks will. Crazy ish get information? supposed receive 80 million march cut 60% 31 million, receive 17 million February. still terrible quite bad 17 July. Moderna Pfizer. Check eBay item # 203251316717

Yes eBay, seller 99% rating. 100% effective stopping serious illness, though. like £2 jab. way EU vaccinated summer 0 sorry. matter much sue anything. Best hope hope US finishes fast get leftovers two weeks second dose absolutely safe know extract 7 doses per vial

_Pfizer wants know location_ looked briefly looks like model? so, think say considered post says definitely false? I'd love see something positive NYT. recent headlines:

""What never get better Covid-19""

""Why vaccines alone end pandemic""

""Variants threaten undo progress world nears 100 million cases""

Still foot firmly doom pedal. still play pandemic want. stay home. unfortunately guidelines official, ones go by. case workplace (not school). seems bonkers me. Relies 100% compliance everyone perfect memory safety redundancies all. article asking questions, giving conclusions. Ok? I’m arguing point applaud speaking 

However ( going stated fact 780 complaints filed )

How many schools United States total....there 130,000 K-12 schools across country.

You math. I'm going boil life ""scientific"" methods practices. I'm robot. cannot wait hug friends common sense wait till like 11 months in? guy seriously trustworthy, keeps going back words. UK supposed get 30m 2020. ended getting 0.5m. 

Such life, create vaccine 8 months would usually take 8 years. 

There's always going issues. shit. shit depressing. Many can't find job even still one constantly exposed can't work home. would anyone want leave Australia? ~100,000 Brits died COVID, phrasing ""100,000 people died due incompetence government"" definitely meant imply ~none would died non-incompetent government. Yes, dumb thing say, that's reason say it, reason call out. EU get 600 million Pfizer doses year. Enough vaccinate everyone wants one. time frame problem. need get done summer. economy sanity severely damaged beyond repair. gotta it. to... band together invent way laundry dishes self-clean put away afterwards. 

I may discovered Skynet gets created.  Us still use Pfizer Moderna jnj exceed order goals. Right jnj production behind schedule, likely better choice vaccines ahead productionize wise produce bottle it. nah we're already masked wear clothes. Vaccinated people going resume normal life, insane anyone trying suggest otherwise. Yet are, common sentiment Atlantic publishing article saying vaccinated people hug other. 

It's clear response covid created bit collective mental health problem, suddenly become normal try bring risks life zero. Yes. agree. Still scary. that? forms censorship embedded law. form censorship excluded. 

Therefore ""concept"" forms censorship limited law said country obliges UN law. Nicely done! wouldn't. Well Biden taking office, course numbers start drastically decline. Even 85 % vaccination rate, still occasional cases. Countries 95 % vaccinated measles still see cases time time. full scale epidemics, cases. diseases, would good enough, New Zealand seems decided nothing zero covid acceptable. oh understand now, im actually canadian aware priority levels rural communities. headline little misleading, made sound like vaccines reserved elders would suggest foul play among public health well. since canadian healthcare institutions exactly good track record regarding treatment indigenous people, would unfortunately surprised. looks like made incorrect assumption, thanks clarification. Unfortunately mrna vaccines intense. possible happen price pay end pandemic. rare case really sad story nonetheless. expected r/coronavirus literally safe space obvious CCP Trolls. far mods sub added several words Automod easy censorship added literally minutes used them; including ""s-h-i-l-l"" ""w-u-m-a-o"". can't use words without Automod removing sub. 

That's pretty crazy, right?

[They also removed comment criticizing CCP, calling Yikes. smart people?

Not Oklahoma’s leadership, apparently. Pfizer exactly give alot warning either production issues. Italy threatening take legal action anything, pandemic showed many idiots nurses/doctors. can't believe many personally know anti vax spewing BS theories covid. looking austria's number, much better France, still limits controlled situation. Averaging around 1k infections day population around 1/8th France, would equivalent 8.5k infections France. averaging 20k yeah, good. still, recall badly, France said within limits control, need &lt;5k day. Austria still outside margins. Hopefully new variants havoc reached. think we're Canada's 'turning point' right now. country fuck now, we're going go road unfortunate countries like US Brazil. :( 


Now exactly double safety measures double complying safety measures! can't wait eat restaurant friends. cold outdoor dining Massachusetts though gone couple times alone. fun without friends none want freeze asses off. country health care workers elderly. would still largely skew elderly data set, since healthcare workers would mix wonder skip people vaccinated antibodies. COVID sniffing dogs airport cost efficient train Johnson Johnson vaccine bad case? yeah see reason anyone virus rush get vaccine unless antibodies (most people getting them) Funny thing mentioned possible Florida host thread r/Japan America’s speed handing vaccines got downvoted hell.  rhe time though EU even approved AZ yet. AZ approved already maybe would informed EU earlier. either way EU would still pissed throw tantrum. mean Italy threatening take legal action angry AZ they're also amgry pfizer.

It’s super easy small island surrounded water people know downvoted. COVID-19 transition team finished. Osterholm said almost week ago. He's longer officially affiliated administration. glad advisory team. took :( 

You're alone.  March 8. first wave coronavirus Spain tests masks. news: ""PharmaMar's COVID-19 genomic kit reach hospitals days"" believe tests still used today, exist . The company grows stock market everytime publish news. Laurie Garrett set rules. scientific journalist...not epidemiologist, economist, psychologist.

She also predicting two years predicted three years beginning...so even adjusted timeline quick release effective vaccines. 

So prediction saying little ""We're year it"". 

I read much this. 

Even Fauci's predictions optimistic.

Now perhaps two years complete eradication...which reasonable. two years masks distancing. I've seen one. happens. full moustache yeah. doubt slow testing line. Japan left late vaccinate time Olympics I'm afraid. let Florida host it. elected shitty leaders, elect again. would expect see deaths fall faster cases

Deaths always lag least 3 weeks. 

I'm rushing get vaccine. I've covid recovered. I'll get vaccine there's surplus supply, probably mid summer so. Coward Arabs kill children Yemen. 

These Cowards needs God punish ever. US finally actually actual *President* office.  


The question becomes, well .... certain political party who's name get comment deleted, errRrr, can't think right now... party able fuck things every one else. :( They've already working hard obstructing everything Biden doing/trying do, he's office one week! Less spread safe! Like basics addition percentages grow time simple understand.

More safe what? emergency room?! sure hospitals, clinic work for, definitely test everybody symptomatic, potentially exposed, even suspected it, including doctors nurses. 

We couple machines perform rapid COVID testing results within minutes. 

I work internal department. boss coworker get tested since potentially exposed (both negative thankfully). entire admin wing infected due someone spreading via ventilation section building. upstairs separate ventilation system, lucked out.

None links far provides better evidence pangolins minks / raccoons article here.

Minks / Raccoons also sold market (see link article) since asymptomatic spillovers, much looks like virus fully adapted already. (which also explained article). case minks infected humans.  heard (just anecdotes) varies wildly. areas, smokers allowed first group. would verify that? take word it. teachers get kind certificate anything proving employment may tricky.

My area (northern Virginia) one worst areas country terms vaccine distribution cutting back appointments supply poor, apparently pretty strict categories. KF94/KN95/N95s within 97-99% effectiveness; comes fit.

Cloth masks made equal; vast majority multiple layers. completely see mean agree you, however uk population 1945 around 47 million - sorry guy lol feel ya. sleep sucked well. What’s frustrating worse sleep patterns makes dealing depression stress harder. Ughhh

Unfortunately, that's unexpected death works, whatever right guys!

For us, owned house together, shared car, savings personal account... huge clusterfuck situation. Yes, death rate bad. Nobody's disputing that. know **why**, **neither you**. Nobody point. 

With hindsight, different policy choices would probably made difference, although really think fair blame govt incompetence following **unanimous** SAGE advice time e.g. delaying initial lockdown. hadn't, know full well go following ""the science"".

But also ignoring lots possible explanations, like UK's demographic age structure higher-than-average obesity rate. fact put blame *entirely* government tells starting conclusion. Unfortunately, might want Advil ready probably grin bear rough you. question is, EU made ""best efforts"" deal AstraZeneca, break contract. mean, 4 million doses, that's nothing missing 59 million doses, still something... Availability - Moderna much capacity. US switch Moderna only, would effectively cut availabe supply vaccine half. countries. :)  Same. used take public transport regularly got tired people coughing sneezing me. noticed got sick often started use well. Japan, common wear masks see stay normal thing. true China long time yet resembles anything like US economically. say won’t continue make strides. two points here:

1. vaccinated subject sea Covid? Acknowledge risk could asymptomatic vaccine could fail follow restrictions apply everyone.
2. surrounded vaccinated people Covid prevalence low non-existent? point, need restrictions go orgy meat locker that's makes happy. Hawaii, not. could see policy similar Hawaii travel really eye-opening find much parents REALLY dislike children. could begin mailing household 5 N95 masks per individual, monthly. got work still phone, coming Society always ""post-truth"", took someone like Trump make masses aware politicians lie. CDC says ""Schools safe, less spread health guidelines followed correctly."" kids wearing masks nose, students going school despite sick, teachers forcing come, testing, they're following guidelines.  dependence American American-backed pharma companies scares half death. really want live world European universal healthcare systems cheap bad thing human progress? Let’s acknowledge data infections schools crap everyone cooking books.  either wait hotel rent car drive back. measures dissuade traveling trip isn’t essential shouldn’t traveling all. country? don’t remember, googling see predictions stating 100K-150K, looking fairly close. Interesting! understand case US, N95 still limited first responders hospital staff. even teachers get Seriously! freedom leave country without asking government ""permission"" like North Korea.

I also return country without facing mandatory 14 day imprisonment.

I also live without fear knowing inevitably detect next case days, implement brutally strict lockdowns.

I also live without knowing life foreseeable future, whereas rest world vaccinations bring things back normal months.

But yeah, Australia, yay. would totallyyyy love there. $1200 + $600 YEAR-long pandemic. US goddamn disgrace im sorry already released oh go noooooo False. think near normal living, either give shit pandemic, living rock. I’m concerned there’s way miss work day grin bear guess? Hopefully get lucky though. fed? earth federal reserve schools?! surely end people complaining discomfort nose swabs cause  10 months seeing slight decrease vaccine effectiveness. Vaccine companies tweak needed.

No Covid never go away easily manage without restrictions people vaccinated.

The MRNA vaccines easily tweaked Pfizer said varient fully evade vaccine.

Just relax. things get better soon. airlines lobbyists going go all.

For goodness sakes --- begun vaccination process, reason hope. we're going go back ""doom"" like this? feel ""acquired"" China?

 
Not sure options mass vaccine trial would work unclear Kim's regime claims virus circulating country, Chinese border closed last year. cities easily dense average American city - we're urban population. many cities. Yes, land mass huge we're ring around outside it.

Victoria's outbreak notably bad winter, eradicated (if use word) long summer. easier maintain now, yes, hard yards done difficult period. going help millions rely pain meds controlling conditions like arthritis etc.  wrong... late December certainly looked possible. Would like set default investigation team? stands, huge concern vaccines less effective current variants. However, identified two key mutations significantly reduce vaccine response - E484K K417N - also likely present future variants arise. Therefore, make booster specifically account mutations, new variants arise build upon existing variants, immediately roll vaccine boosters. Plenty adults afraid needles. It’s uncommon phobia. J&amp;J means guaranteed. study seems going well, know publish next week. probly real nobody's actually sick lol whoops spoke da troof Virginia here...last checked county 18% positivity rate, assume higher bc, know kids getting tested nearly much adults. school currently full time person (our kids virtual) two middle school teachers (small school-150 MS students) positive. need quarantine students. Two teachers positive xmas-same approach. Two teachers “teaching home” week explanation. POSSIBILITY STUDENT CURRENTLY COVID. back testing, quarantining, tracing, telling. furious never able make INFORMED decision may safe send kids back. CDC duped schools, allowing continue. utter bullshit anyone paying attention knows it. Plague burned villages left ~90% infected dead. Luckily covid victims fare better, allows virus infect people peak multiple times. really effective antibiotic treatment plague, hygiene/quality living rendered almost non-existent.

With covid, we’ve got infected people walking around near others unknowingly spreading virus. makes vaccine essential stopping spread getting back normal. 

And, agree you’re saying return normal psychosocial necessity it. But, imagine covid ifr 90% caused lymph nodes quite literally explode... people perhaps would inclined stay in, least burned population. South Midwest. Jeezus christ go back life. Also vaccine priorities fucked. Sky News reporting now:

Apparently subreddit allow links comments mods bother approving comment. search Google yourself. Keywords search: ""America's Frontline Doctors arrested"" Depends. **If** (hypothetical speaking here) EU contract states something like ""If due production shortages enough vaccines available every customer get reduced share order"". would contradict UK treaty states something like ""In case shortages UK priority"".

Pfizer/Moderna vaccines amount time suppose. It’s scary teachers. joke. people, many, love fearing lives. Sucks getting downvoted. right set reasonable expectation. Pandemics tend need around 2 years shake out. unreasonable unlikely one magnitude would clear that. clear doses contract currently. Biden wants them, there's guarantee get them. companies sold lots doses recently supply constraints. Yes. Ebola controlled that’s vaccines produced. learned something new today. fully expect identical virtually identical one Chinese vaccines. Worst job ever. fever, chills, headaches develop injection,” use pain relievers help symptoms, develop report significant side effects medical professional, Wildes said.

Pretty simple, take anything get shot take something develop symptoms afterwards.

The reasoning: studied pain relievers could affect vaccine different situation children taking pain relievers childhood vaccines showed fewer antibodies children took nothing, although still enough provide protection. upvoted correct. thing is, lots folks gotten psychological trap ***no*** amount risk acceptable. problem ""incorrect"" information, worldview changed dramatically unrealistic expectations. even know point besides let burn attempt lockdown capacity threatened.

Problem nobody listen year epic vaccine failure.

Americans sort normal spring imagine seeing make people even resistant lockdown. Well temperature checks useless general month it?!?! literally post another expert sub saying hope never too. clearly meant real lockdown, even pretend American lockdowns serious, that's blatantly false; states never shut time, free travel among them, resisted locking all. feel like really nitpicking ""punishment"" vs ""consequences"". something shitty caused lose 10 million per year job. Seems fair strong punishment/consequence. Sounds like thing upset government involved job loss? government mandated job loss, would feel better it? advice strange. Either based inappropriate scientific rationale (that may made sense e.g. Ebola), political stuff, major contributor severity pandemic. that's even close worst case scenario that's plausible right now. evolutionary pressures virus become less deadly (it spreads pre-symptomatically) already shown that, time, progressively mutate around vaccines. absolutely could stick around come advanced mitigation escapable, like effective treatment symptoms something. Yes seasonality help. Common cold cornaviruses peak December-January. What? Where? got like 100+ downvotes saying yesterday factually untrue posts getting 1000+ upvotes. Pfizer's PR team must fucking geniuses. They've got everyone thinking they're us favor really they're fucking us over. least EU understands what's happening. realize vaccines stockpiled right? people keep bringing EMA approval? Unless contract says delivery contingent EMA approval, matter whether EMA approves vaccine not. sign contract deliver date, breach contract. absolutely fucking disgusted behaviour big banks investment houses 2007-2009, “little person” also lot enabling crisis buying homes could afford, signing ridiculous mortgages could never pay, living outside means entire 2000s. stock market crash wouldn’t nationwide housing crisis without average person involved rampant overspending time. Ah, silver bullet ... Metaphorically Thank you, wise comforting! wish good day!  You’re missing point. doesn’t matter drug tested. “to fair” here. Trump cult wrong push unproven drug. adds misinformation huge way. worked drug irrelevant larger point wrong this. don’t know said don’t work. definitely tell Covid time test. that’s it. evidence negative result means won’t contagious tomorrow?  idea EU nice. could consideration confident enough data results want share course. effective vaccines it’s unlikely hit 1m. see engineers, too. get trouble assume breadth knowledge extends beyond areas they've studied. Ok cool. agree completely. feels orwellian see eyes walking streets. studies definitely show significant difference cloth surgical masks. course n95 way better Pfizer already said supply issues EU sorry, wording brexiteer 101.  think many outdoor ones say ""if can't distance"".

I never wear one outside, simply make sense. really care people stare anything. Wearing mask hike (or god forbid, car) bordering religious belief. risk already 20x lower outdoors simply understand people wearing mask they're middle park pull 1 second sort pass someone. Things like really skew messaging promote defiance. large crowd people outdoors, sure. true, paid three months later, warned time would roughly three months behind UK, happened. Australia going vaccines well know. basically they'll spent pandemic completely normal they'll still get benefit immunization, sounds like pretty good deal me. paid later hit delays factories UK ones months ago. There’s reason UK got significantly less doses 2020 supposed EU similarly effected High school student here. I'm online school pandemic. I've always fairly responsible student homework time/studied tests, virtual learning, I've missing lot deadlines generally struggling function normally. find hard sit read textbook days - want stay bed day, I've mental breakdowns usual. feel guilty unproductivity. feel lazy useless. days actually find strength responsibilities, feel drained empty end day - I've never felt drained homework attended school in-person. Yeah, little confusing. point quarentine bide time vaccine. 

That point mitigation measures, point quarantine detect keep COVID positives away healthy population. Official quarantine measures would far useful COVID-19 testing domestic travel without quarantining. Ok.  Nope, terrified covid locking indoors another year confused comment. Vaccines helping us get herd immunity. ""worst pandemic"" two weeks away since February 2020. generally let slide unless trying prescribe controlled substances

That's pretty much it. PharmD's care they're filling z-pak, draw line anything might get hot water, i.e. opioids amphetamines. also talk God answers everything. don't. matter ""rare"" vaccine reaction may be. man father bet would different reaction. rocket scientist know something sound right here. need quit berating people highlighting fact looks suspicious. correct answers fact danger society trying censor people stop asking questions. 

What man allergic something vaccine? subtle reaction first one never told anyone, severe reaction second one? unknowingly covid vaccine triggered sort response? 

These things need investigated. fun games nonsense family member. doubt would brush was.  also, I'm mistaken, variants multiple mutations spike protein traced back patients covid multiple months treated antibodies. virus kept mutating them, still spreading. remember correctly happened UK, variant Asia, I'm sure figured case African Brazilians variants. NYTimes ran doomsday article many people infected ""lift restrictions"" now. restrictions talk masking, social distancing, etc. we're anyway. people friend group already got confused it. really annoying media playing people like fiddle. tentative Schedule agreed upon, concrete obligation, per AZ contingent AZ ""best efforts"". 

CureVac also similar ""best effort"" obligation, AZ obligation UK ordinary binding. 

As said, EU singed late AZ, makes sense best could offered tentative schedule, set stone obligations. 

I honestly think EU negotiated badly, think time ready sign contract, AZ offered anything concrete. Production delays happen, uncommon new production lines. AZ sells product cost (no profit) it'd odd take huge risk lose money promising signing binding contract early production big 400 million. 350M . . . pretty much population US. hope wrong. :-) What's really alarming USA Today covering this. Stop spreading lie. EU pay guaranteed deliveries, vaccines delivered based AZs best effort.  think point way AZ, EU place export controls vaccines. AZ wring fingers throw EU bus delivering customers outside EU, simultaneously fulfilling obligations EU.

The deliveries EU UK finished end year, there's question they're still happening.  Three son's teachers tested positive COVID week. 

It went one email week school notifying us person contracting COVID, two three emails day. ridiculous. thought similarly sympathized kids like started, I’ve started appreciate miss school cuz didn’t realize mentally abusive household is..

That's exactly I've trying explain. might breach contract vaccines produced Netherlands could've European stock too, since AstraZeneca also use production facility Netherlands produce EU's vaccines. went UK fullfil contract. vaccines could've gone EU too, considered breach ""best effort"" contract.

Everyone talking deal signed September, June like UK, nobody putting attention fact EU also paid September, sure AZ would deliver promised. could ask money back plus interest due damage.

Anyway think company would way hurt fucking 2nd economy world (the EU whole). There's evidence doses EU paid given UK.

1. UK still functioning member EU doses shipped;
2. Production EU started UK's order, months EU's order;
3. means UK done order, production would even behind;
4. doses produced long ago they'd expire EU gets rolled out.

Clearly EU-produced doses paid for, therefore belonging to, UK.

Why surprise country placed first order got first shipment?! EU can't retrospectively claim ownership doses UK paid for. Haha well get ready long reply.

At first phone appointment primary care doctor March (cause I'd scheduled appointment February seen &amp; COVID hit). referred Neurologist, also migranes &amp; thought symptoms migrane related (even tho understand would be, went along it) 

Neurologist ordered brain MRI came back clean. I'm guessing checking MS symptoms diseases overlap. 

Then around June, person visits finally opened (I'm LA) able go person doctor. ran bunch different bloodwork everything looked okay, iron, ferritin, vitamin levels low. began take prescription supplements &amp; days that, woke trigger finger left hand. 

I talked mom weird thing happened finger &amp; that's told would happen grandma &amp; RA. 

I look RA &amp; like, holy shit could answer. I'd never even considered &amp; idea ran family. 

So went back doctor information referred rheumatologist. 

Now typical blood work run autoimmune diseases normal me-- like ANA, CRP, ESR.

I able get diagnosed Rheumatologist knew run test that's specific RA called anti-CCP. definitely make sure run test her. Also aware ppl normal bloodwork across board joint damage imaging. bloodwork end diagnosis.

Anyway... month later started treatment HCQ &amp; 2 months that, began feeling difference. 

I used wake every morning feeling like I'd hit truck. crazy fatigue, brain fog, stiffness, body aches.. I'd sometimes feel like coming flu &amp; even get low grade fever (the amount times thought COVID got diagnosed many). 

I later learned common symptoms RA medication helped tremendously reducing symptoms. handful bad days month opposed like almost every day. 

I also later discovered common people autoimmune diseases low iron &amp; low vitamin D. quite sure why, seems thing. able get iron up, still struggling vitamin D. that's ongoing thing still. 

It's slow process get diagnosed. Usually people wait months see specialist &amp; get tossed around several landing right one. got lucky COVID, everyone else cancelled appointments &amp; therefore able seen fairly quickly comparison.

That nuts. though. Maybe try meditation. Stress isn’t good I'm gonna reply every one comments starting August wish case won’t be, would hoped year really proved that.

Also throwing comments effect “i don’t give shit people vaccinated, want” isn’t really supporting part working together. Watching parents react city’s plan reopen schools hybrid basis makes worry they’ll ever get education back normal. Fear anger everywhere.

The decision hype severity (more like lack severity) COVID children order gain broad compliance guidelines going bite society ass, hard. Especially everybody realizes childhood vaccine isn’t going ready Fall 2022.

Just complete messaging disaster.  reason boycott Hey least bullshit. Yeah. need get back way thinking pandemic. covid becomes level flu, able live normal lives again. whole point beginning putting strain hospitals. One thing bothers this, see effort classes outside even though avoiding enclosed spaces important part guidelines. Even mask, spread much greater enclosed spaces. higher population density make difficult vaccinate people? UK vaccine still marketed sold AZ, *not* case India. Seoul, India, huh? kinda smushed different paragraphs together there. British Parliament regarding Covid-19 vaccine exports EU** 

 ""\[The UK' supply\] dedicated supply chain ability commit 100 million doses affected approval status supply chains."" country live everything NZ ? things equal result NZ ? (and my) country could more. People get irritated ignorant people unaware rules 1 year Symptoms tied ability spread coronavirus utter bullshit; top head, European ski vacation super spreader events happened one months period one vacationing businessman spread virus around 25 days showing symptoms. IE, body mobilizing strong immune system response equate virus suddenly spreadable. It’s anti mask talking points they’ve fed regurgitate. It’s bullshit. Yeah, work keep trying tell fever 104F. keep telling “well feel awful healthy someone horribly ill.” US extracting 7 doses per vial.

1. Israelis getting vaccines US. didn’t start vaccinating phase 3 trial data complete. They’re trading thorough population level data manufacturers get better understanding % need vaccination achieve herd immunity. 

2. Israel’s cases jumped. still plenty new cases every day new case rate trending. comment regards mask wearing/mandates. get vaccine currently infected benefits infection minimal. However vaccine may still help prevent subsequent infections.  U.K. approved AZ EU not, makes sense direct current production area good. would stockpile vaccines entity may may choose use could sell elsewhere use today? Orange County coroner's office said investigating man's death, adding correlation vaccine notify OC Heath Care Agency.

So, haven’t said it’s actually vaccine? Unless direct line two might well auto accident.  Great headline. Everyone seems confident ""springtime""

That's unofficial word hospital work vaccine going ""encouraged"" ""mandatory"" employees Fingers TIGHTLY crossed good data J&amp;J next week. Or, poor source poor journalism? think bold changed wishful timeline would make much sense. make matters worse, district decided extend CARES Act policy (implemented federal level, mind you) March 31. get sick quarantine, you’re sick days. We’ve already multiple teachers burn 14 days (not even full pay). subs, classes already combined, kids testing positive. It’s obvious little Susie absent 10 days, even school doesn’t advise us positive case. 

Had student come school Monday. ten minutes bell, stated she’d sister’s house entire weekend.

You free go back normal spring. 

Hell, expect restrictions gone areas red mid February. people there, things back normal.

For people, day restrictions ended. people anxiety, could years never. yourself. contracts work. sign contract later states delivery sooner contract signed someone else earlier company deliver first.

TLDR: **the date signed contract matter, agreed upon delivery dates do** Plenty well. pilot programs state test kids weekly zero Covid spread. cases isolated. worst outbreak includes high school middle school kids. perfect enough.

That's true mate. AZ obligation EU make ""best effort"" deliver time, done.

 Reuters reports effort completely standard clause signing contract company product yet exist,” one official said. “Obviously cannot put completely legal obligation” conditions. 
But official said best effort meant company show “overall” effort develop deliver also question whether AZ everything could make plants produce expected. 

This called question course, questions first directed sub contractor actually producing vaccines. plants actually owned operated AZ.

Furthermore, since EU took sweet time signing agreement AZ, makes sense less time iron supply chain production EU. Remember even though UK production 3 months still production issues early. Btw. AstraZeneca signed contract Novasep Belgium already June (more month contracts CDMOs UK). AstraZeneca enough time get everything running Belgian plant 

AZ run facility. Novasep does, manufacturing problems would fall subcontractor. Furthermore, signing contract mean funds got allocated right away, especially scale unknown prior signing contract EU. We're talking hundreds millions investment, companies can't take earth company notice deliver 40% committed volume days deliveries start? 

No argument there, notified EU long advance. part complete disgrace hose things phrased like ""in event reduced product availability, vendor allocates available products fairly across current commitments clients"". 

That would direct breach UK contract, UK contract specifies UK plants first foremost supply UK deliveries. There's also export ban vaccines UK, AZ would need asinine accept clause. Cold, humid, impossible socially distance. could better? Imagine wanting watch Tom Brady vs chiefs zzzzzzzzzzzz Thank explanation. could smell BS article, didn’t seem true. lookup Tien Vo appear statement made. 

It’s mind boggling think licensed doctors spread type misinformation. know absolutely nothing epidemiological data behind ebola. Outbreaks ebola self limiting. got crazy high death rate spread long distances air. 

25 ebola outbreaks equate like maybe 12k deaths. effectively non issue developed world.

The vaccines useful Africa people spend lots time around dead bodies believe science. Again, following scientific advice minutes SAGE meeting 23 March, SAGE reiterates previous advice closing borders would negligible effect spread virus.

That advice may wrong hindsight - think know yet, may never know sure - criminally irresponsible government follow time.

I really think comparing UK NZ realistic. We're much bigger, much denser, northern-hemisphere seasons far international traffic anyone even thinking pulling Madagascar. ""Virus free"" IMO never option. Yeah, think less region rural vs. urban/suburban. politics. point honestly. likely MRNA vaccines make future pandemic minimal issue vaccine made within three months sent people within two three months pandemic within half year. Medical technology render mistakes made government unimportant that's good thing. idiots go politics  really find suspect kids don’t pass Covid literally pass every virus teachers, parents, time... Yep!!!! tell schools following protocols. say would kill 1 million Americans? knew we'd get vaccine? so, that's unreasonable estimate. Even take vaccines timeline account, he's going less factor 2, could get really close time said done include excess deaths. better public education, need even acknowledge level idiocy, let alone governed it. Covid deniers would less plentiful far fewer people would die needlessly.... saying true, people would argue normal people can't expected know manage finances. put money front face, could resist?

Personally, agree you. sides blame. borrowing hundreds thousands dollars understand structure loan current future payments be.  Eu funded novasep facility

That facility Belgium makes precursor, actual vaccine. no, NL facilities 2 producing vaccine according AZ CEO : ""The UK receives vaccines two British production sites, Europe factories Belgium Netherlands. According Soriot, Europe unlucky production problems occurring 'its' factories. ""

Just add, never plan, [a dec 8th original plan British doses produced supply chain set Oxford university AstraZeneca UK. vaccine manufactured behalf two biotech companies, Oxford BioMedica Cobra Therapeutics, filled finished Wockhart Wrexham. I've many vaccine dreams get shot return normal. discouraging wake up. One night, three separate vaccine dreams. rough morning. year late feel good. Certainly impactful international restrictions given much higher volume domestic flights, still pointless. 

This huge macro generalization people flying unsafe they're flying unsafe live. Maybe traveling destination promotes riskier behaviors, differences make compared packed, maskless bars restaurants kids packed schools?

I'm saying would zero impact, lot hassle relatively low return. get easy target (regulated federally something done without relying states), *meaningful* target. 

Not do-nothinger (and yes, government parallel task things), point effort applied getting vaccines distributed people's arms. I'd supportive action August September inevitable winter spike occurred, point seems bit like pissing wind. Cases already falling case saturation we're close wide-scale vaccinations. believed UK fixed supply contract, although obviously proven. That's trade signing investing 3 months earlier betting ony vaccine still gamble. [presented without point, increasing evidence may carry active virus noses infected many actually differentiating vaccinated unvaccinated people. I've already run ins couple antimaskers claimed vaccinated. Multiple problems that: I'm not, clue telling truth, past second dose 95% less likely get ill, people around us also probably vaccinated.

People always bright. vaccine effect, rates illness fall. criteria returning normal, going trusting people following social distancing guidelines vaccinated say are. Finally. tired “why still social distance vaccine” articles. year everything possibly look others, I’m going fuck back normal life looking again. area, going back school also meant travellin gon school bus 60 students schools. 

Also, schools open encouraged play dates (because kdis together six hours another hour two?) parents scoialising drop-off/pickup. mention staff sharing washrooms breakroom mealtimes (which transmission happening according Ministry Labour here) yeah highly seasonal suspect almost everyone who's living life somewhat normally gotten virus that's seeing cases going down. Right. think many people would alive actually vaccine crippling stupidity. worst catastrophe plagues Europeans brought New World 1492. span century, population Americas reduced something like 90%.

thank pointing out.

it's fairly disgusting comparisons often made euro-centric ""catastrophies"" completely ignoring ones happened populations (especially populations heavily abused europeans/those european descent - kinda like screaming terrible nazis ignoring early US settlers achieved verly close complete success wrt \*intentional\* genocide native populations) Tien Vo full shit. Either air exchanges run air. part series political lies claim asphyxiate ""reinhale"" diseases shit masks. workers wear hospitals tradesmen wear protective full face masks working hazardous spaces.

Osterholm right surgical mask stop aerosolized covid. thought mask two things: Catches ""droplet"" (where droplets micrometers size, rain droplet size) going **sometimes** catches going in.

Its antimaskers dangerous: breathe \*everything\* air around everyone else, medical masks/""face coverings"" much stop inhaling it. county's dashboard says 4 outbreaks schools. said four outbreaks since October. Count doubtful. nothingburger. issues addressed article easily addressed. one valid concern may limited mobility, thus may difficulty putting on, removing, adjusting mask. Everything else, though? Smeared makeup? Small price pay simple preventative measure. wearing KN94 similar since late March. health, all. clear red flag anyone schools werent opened safety mind.

There evaluation school ensure capable meeting guidelines. literally 0 guarantee American school standards safety expect.

But isnt. get puppy dog eyes grown adults Express kid earning suspensions keep willfully removing mask program without designated mask break space. ask kid know school changed wear masks becomes abundantly clear parents think hoax... infuriating.

And vaccine authroised use going help that?

Especially &lt;2m week UK plants output? whether approved pretty irrelevant given prepaid 330million last year start production. pay advance product sure hell want know production problems occur. Italian strategy probably result Pfizer delivering less vaccine since dosages theoretically extracted given vial. practice proven quite difficult unreliable though leading even fewer vaccinations. Depends contract whether chance success.

The main reason EU approved AZ vaccine data salad happened stage 3 trial people received 1.5 dosages counter intuitively supposedly goes hand better effectiveness. different UK willing give emergency authorization thus required time data evaluate it. really curious EMA say friday regarding matter. Exactly. problem technology solve. 

I wonder ramp respirator production give everybody one. Yes, cost around 500 bucks, peanuts compared economic damage COVID. real problem idea COVID-19 spreading via schools joke. local school district everything possible make sure vaccines available staff starting next week going go back full time person school March 1st matter what. But: (a) mandatory lot school staff get vaccinated ""reasons""; and, (b) students still can't get vaccinated they're gonna spread shit like crazy households district.

And two people household higher risk can't get vaccine they're 75 work school, groups able get vaccines right now.

Yet Governor went TV yesterday touted people genetic disorders make higher risk able get vaccines. BULLSHIT. I've called state dept health, local county dept health, every surrounding county dept health, local children's hospital, primary care physicians, dept developmental disabilities, name it. VACCINES available unless 75+.

I'm relative that's doctor another state see help.

The idea kids sitting classroom six hours day really, really new; idea certain things children need memorise (states capitials multiplication tables) order officically labled ""adequately educated"". care ""my coworkers rushing take vaccine!"" anecdotes

But anecdotal evidence daily discussion threads about! think one biggest problems entire time kind ""all nothing"" approach media taken informing people cannot do. last summer every single news report people gathering showed crowded beaches - probably one safest activities take part virus transmits primarily via aerosols.

Print media way better TV, though. There's odd gem story conveying fucked thinking take account FACT there's continuum risk, nothing No. many social issues continued spread.

This pandemic going last long despite vaccine.
That's going helpful keeping covid epidemics region going forward. US less problematic elsewhere. Cases rapidly going vaccination going largely irrelevant end March end April. hang months everyone! Orgy meat locker? That’s weird fetish have. lmao think first time I've seen country getting scammed Compare New York Florida lmao. watched government giving multiple long speeches plan ""flatten curve"", exactly every Western European country planned do. virus stops almost completely. fact studies looking various types viruses showing well masks work. Corona viruses general close 100%. influenza like 50% aerosol particles smaller think. Covid relatively large aerosolized virus means masks work better expected think.  Actually read it, seems J&amp;J expected lower efficacy. might disagree, that’s compromise there. I’d put trouble dealing second shot case. work home? paying bills?

If parents saying basically worth getting teachers sick society meet financial obligations would discussion real tradeoffs. basically told medical staff keep working even though knew going get sick. told medical staff keep working proper PPE. 

Trying say schools safe, need shutdown outdoor golf courses dumb face science/public health officials join stupidity justifies treating public health officials like politicians. run issue can’t produce enough vaccine prioritize risk.

*This option have*. That's exponential growth works. either bring virus zero overwhelm hospitals go second lockdown.

China went option one, Europe went option two. China mostly open hardly cases deaths, Europe second lockdown thousands dead unless guess wealthy

Healthcare cost millions Covid cases ain't exactly cheap. Sure, comes EU shifting blame incompetence, seems like EU citizens buying that.

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck Hello all,

I wanted run things see fact check article regarding masks. true?

The respected Dr. Tien Vo said recently scientific basis support long-term use masks. “The person exhales inhales air lungs trying expel – air stays mask. lungs trying get rid toxins.”

Dr. Michael Osterholm, infectious disease environmental health expert University Minnesota, declared “surgical masks cloth masks…don’t stop aerosols…and virus basically going right around sides open gaps masks.” think comparable US Portugal comparable state 10M people US states reported deaths cases Portugal week pandemic. philly cheesesteak extra tomatoes No, no, - bringing sun body it! he's trying spend money eradicate polio make tiny fraction money back workers taking less polio sick days? 
With business acumen wonder made billions.

Such desperation admit maybe he's creepy wants help. would assume downvotes premature. yet know sure vaccine prevents people spreading disease. *probably* does, trials look can't say sure. I'm everything besides Reddit hobby Instagram. Reddit tough one break, hobby Instagram full people making cool shit, mind keeping it.

Facebook go die garbage fire care. Aight, dude certainly not! contrary, level-headed, facts-based approach approach get us back 'normal' ASAP. hurried attempts past months, much like premature vaccine passport concept, what's delaying return normal!

Yeah, better nothing last 5 days almost 3 milion people tested (if want go work nature) overall 0,7% detected like infected AG tests. 

We 22th day strict lockdown weeks mandatory AG testing ahead nobody knows get better. pace vaccination slow, around 500 people per day enough vaccines. me? visit family seen close 2 years. think you’re bit pessimistic here, gloomy. lol perfect example nothing makes sense morons.

It is. There's convincing doom-and-gloom crowd life going back normal sooner rather later. EU doesn’t work like that. Membership based unanimous agreement. think Pfizer would quickly step EU distribution centers started going rogue?  Brilliant 👏🏻🤣 depends fine print contract. think unlikely EU would knowingly signed contract saying receive vaccines UK finished vaccination program.

Yes know said fema national guard involved, far, action.
Having people stand line crowded location(in hopes getting vaccinated), cutting line ,(wealthy canadian couple) stealing (paramedic busted) really way. Lies. plenty states locked hard performing/were performing much worse FL terms deaths per capita 7 day average spread. That’s entirely true...some want people give everything don’t feel safe don’t want feel left fun either... Fair enough. personally think they're selfish, would say people feel way, human. photo shows big reason why, too. Let’s see Biden save lives

Probably much, people fatigued already much misinformation there. Whatever going happen going happen opinion. Getting vaccine fast really thing help, assuming provides protection variants.  long 20s EBIC 😎 no, bill microsoft always labelled evil company everyone unashamedly used products.

Not scientific considering point, even know vaccination POSSIBLE.  catch some, though. finally personal anecdote, dear friend's wife booked head Canada visit father, likely long live (weeks believe docs saying). lined 14-day quarantine spot etc. prepared tests; planned driving save money (and car there) technically need present test border (as right air travel) headed long-term care facility responsible person got test.

MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Publix soon become **sole** distributor COVID-19 vaccines one South Florida county.

Dr. Alina Alonso, state health department director Palm Beach County, confirmed Governor Ron DeSantis chose county ‘test site’ pilot program vaccines funneled grocery giant.

She said vaccine doses initially supposed sent county’s **health department reallocated Publix.**

County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay happy Publix control, according concerned rollout way leave minority populations luck don’t live close Publix.** “The main recommendation use (Moderna) vaccine based current elements recommend given doses 100 micrograms 0.5 ml interval 28 days,” Alejandro Cravioto, panel chair, told news briefing.

“This interval might moved 42 days evidence go beyond time,” said.  Definitely know I'm lucky. reason know son exposure. quarantined 6 days caution, nobody symptoms, go back work. went get test sure, I'll damned came back positive. known otherwise, would chalked fatigue something else. 

The fatigue weird. expecting it, asymptomatic otherwise, but... hits hard. know easy, could go day okay. I'd crash HARD got home, think properly later day. Still, know mild compared others, especially since lasted week. afraid Y2K again?

That much worried possible future stop exports AZ follow contracts signed

Also produce virtually pfizer doses Canada  studies. Google them. controversial. know schools safer.

""We"" ""know"" this, despite studies saying this. also studies saying opposite, scientific process takes time.

Keep mind even linked studies say Covid clusters ""minimized"" good social distancing sanitization practices.  Minimized, eliminated.

How many children family members catching virus acceptable here?  even one person dies forcing children back school, that's many.

As comments ""children left behind"", advocate educational funding cut continually last decade US? children going disadvantaged even pandemic happened.

I suggest set aside preconceptions saying schools re-open re-examine situation.

It teachers' unions saying schools re-open, lot people knowledgeable science bias toward trying ""protect"" economy.

You blame whomever like, objective examination facts show schools spread virus. spread acceptable, avoidable deaths acceptable, regardless perceived gain.  Children spend extra time school reach pre-defined level education far preferable spend time funerals.

People aren’t given information need. Nah. late. Mobility data shows America essentially back ""normal"".

Even at-will employment pretty big pain ass fire someone unless something illegal directly negatively impact bottom line. sure hell hope so. would love go back bartending bit... struggle getting real. mean do, rare typically jobs given high schoolers/college students minorities businesses question tend small businesses title garbage, Israel vaccines use, 30% population vaccinated, still need millions more.

Also, going past precedent, Israel finish population they'd start vaccinating Palestinians. passed PPE, testing kits ventilators Palestinians throughout pandemic. :( Hmm wonder happened recently might changed sort political outlook ideals nation? tried really hard find articles English able. [relatively ""old"" newspaper article (in Spanish) summarises really diagrams different Spanish candidates. recommend focusing one Luis Enjuanes &amp; Isabel Solá. ones developing self-replicating RNA vaccine takes large part virus genome (unlike specific RNA ones), remove ability reinfecting cells (making safer).

Other significant efforts: 
Vicente Larraga (DNA vaccine) 
Salvador Borrós &amp; Cristina Fornaguera (RNA vaccine nanoparticles coating) 
Javier Montenegro (working stable coatings RNA vaccines) false equivalence. Completely ridiculous argument. option waiting two weeks better vaccine month significantly better vaccine mostly avoid exposed damn sure would that. luxury would take whatever available course. Yes. less, early estimate based average different datasets.

So:

40 70 percent transmissible.

30 percent (or higher) deadly.  want able get back birthday last year. Went casino downtown Cleveland close friends great night.

That year ago now, wish could like again.  Fauci said hit like 60% things return normal. Israel administer vaccines, different US, UK, Bahrein, UAE Germany aside vaccination campaign vastly successful?

It's like rest world waiting results Israel starting Also, Israel's active cases jumped \*precipitously\* last week. 

That's true, number daily new cases per Israeli gov dashboard. Green line rolling average see trending downwards. essential care purposes children key workers. like 60% healthcare workers refusing vaccine? top that, thought vaccine still prevent transmitting others? goddamn thing. EU financed vaccine AstraZeneca sells profit countries like Sout Africa tells EU ""Yeah can't produce enough""  Either way I'm getting annoyed relative he's going around saying vaccine gave covid.

For data, see: Yeah poor never killed anyone /s. sure getting downvoted spot on. Everyone convinced thing worry ever Covid, soon that's gone we're hunky dory. damage already done completely fucked economically years come.

But shutdown sourdough crowd says 'always rebuild business' guess there's that. CEO already broken confidentiality agreement, according EU. well within rights release, least portion contract stipulates firm commitment best endeavors, counter public statement already made CEO. said - Europe isn’t well suited buy vaccines centrally power decide member states. change future!

Europe flaws, it’s benefits overweight massively love institution! One reason would way easier fuck us, wouldn’t stand United! Seriously dog owners bag 'em take vet check worms.

&amp;#x200B;

do really need swab?

i buy poop bags thousand time. No, Paris. grocery stores Paris open Sundays. curfew, stores crowded ever weekends. We're sure well vaccines prevent transmission vaccinated unvaccinated people, best avoid crowds wear masks public on.

Even so, vaccinated people spread unvaccinated, mean chances happening high. China’s getting trolled media outlets one!  like addiction, people realize addicted drop many remain addicted. past couple years led believe social media nothing cancer upon society. like dumbest shit I've seen today. Imagine growing still believing crap. 


Cringe man..you people cringe hell..ugh . Ya vaccine rollout horse shit Nice think Canada get plenty vaccines next couple months. Likely mostly moderna nvax think. Canada recently ordered nvax could get uk's 60m doses well I'd argue (with uninformed ass) majority experts non-experts also fell psychological trap, especially early pandemic. Disinfecting groceries, even coming within twenty feet people, etc. world perfect hindsight might better lock less hard March emphasize safe methods socialization. would almost exactly effect terms infection control causing level isolation, might prevented ""bottling up"" led people holding massive gatherings instant draconian restrictions lifted.

TLDR scientists ignore human nature,  Well Texas going see Defending Western Conference Champion Dallas Stars beat shit Red Wings! nothing harsh Paris. like commenter said, numerous indoor parties bars/restos illegally open. shops malls insanely crowded. seriously crazy sucks us take covid seriously want done pandemic asap.  Unless livelihood disappeared worry paying months back rent. mean can’t take kids work. work chemical plant. online school kid went daycare sit iPad watch teacher 9 kids same. risk community 10 kids class together learning live trades risk kindergarten teacher daycare teacher. many people stay home parent days? miss faces miss faces bad Texas prioritize teachers/librarians vaccination. cases every week keep information staff.

Meanwhile, got second vaccine shot yesterday work hospital. Feel absolutely terrible today, know I'm fortunate. cries Canadian grasp concept 85% people responsible 15%?

Because 85% kill 15% reckless. There's 400K US dead. Covid going top 3 leading causes death year. expect people wear seat belts carry insurance drive neither us major problem accident.

Perfect example. take precautions driving safer expect people same. works way virus. going 650-700k deaths end pandemic, since anti-vaxxers keep dying long vaccination campaign complete. one many moment. I’ve deleted accounts several platforms already seriously reduced time spent remaining accounts have. stay keep touch people it’s otherwise mentally healthy step away. state, I’m Vancouver, Canada haha, lord knows I’ll allowed to. Wbu? Since I've summoned, meant handful pretzels dinner cuz dont wanna cook, sick know cook. I'm eating less, I'd assume would lose lbs. 'reduced yields' one plant led 60% decline beyond me. supposedly, judging phrasing still yields Belgian plant and, presumably decent yields German plant. yet deliveries 60% down. Something really wrong here, sounds like AZ massively overpromised could deliver even reduced yields. anecdote blatantly false. 0% chance anywhere country in-person learning 5 months zero spread. 
 
If completely make up, much likely case lying statistics simply attributing without evidence every case school came outside school. 
 
There plenty data showing teachers much higher risk general public. EU isnt one bought paid vaccines. getting quality education? Taking away people’s ability work earn YEARS time wouldn’t result type warranted unrest?

It must nice job that’s unaffected this, many aren’t lucky. 

I’m mind I’m realist. 

If variants truly brand new coronavirus can’t controlled vaccine, suggest next 12 months? Continue see family, earn income spend limited years earth hiding? let world continue collapse around us print fake money forever letting oligarchs profit suffering? What’s suggestion That's what's happening. Even one fun virus would spreading spreads amongst working class low-income people work essential jobs keep society propped us afford distance work home. ...i see there. mean “they don’t they’re vaccine”? country does? world clearly gone mad!  Right? I’m workaholic myself, don’t want life cycle working, staring screens, anxiety. definitely sympathize folks who’ve taken risks situation stretched on, too. Yep, obviously far fewer teachers kids even fewer teachers risk. would easy vaccinate risk let risk get back lives. simple man. see someone complaining downvotes, downvote.  anybody give eli5 explanation whats happening EU AZ? I'm sorry can't brush death rate local healthy teacher died father at-risk. want teacher die want father die. 

You seem get people **are scared transmitting someone at-risk.** I'm worried chances, I'm worried killing father 77 year old co-worker.   pretty young 90s 80s think also quite remember well.

Microsoft forced pc vendors use ms dos windows various shady MS-dos copy QDOS.

Then antitrust cases late 90s. 

And whole internet explorer thing.

And HB1 visa thing able underpay employees.

I'm saying he's evil. definitely going heaven :-) People wealthier nations likely travel internationally often, vaccinating first would technically reduce likelihood global spread. Ofc I'm saying would morally correct :$ Apparently, answer seems yes! real issue Anybody would describe public school teachers ""coddled"" forfeited right taken seriously. grasp concept 85% people responsible 15%? eliminate chance hitting someone car never driving. never get drive. expect people wear seat belts carry insurance drive neither us major problem accident. also expect people age 70+ serious health conditions take care risk 10,000 times higher rest population. Soon enough!

What state in? pretty clear current administration would engaging theatrical window-dressing order take credit decline would happened anyways. Hell could excel would make sense Hell could excel would make sense Yeah apparently county students school 70 days lose funding.
So yeah next Monday I'm going back person school.
Wish luck catching Covid. Agreed. 

They EU always does. acted like bunch entitled teenagers, made political, wasted member states money forcing dump money vaccine doomed fail start. wasted better part 2020 (and billions), everyone else made deals spent billions funding vaccine development, came table expect treated like priority.

Shit like exactly Britons voted leave EU. balanced diet fiber variety plant sources improve gut microbe efficiency, leading better absorption nutrition overall better health alert brain. Calories calories weight loss broken core. sure would argue except bringing extreme outliers. problem course enough teachers selfish enough make work

This big issue. system (in GA least) takes advantage altruistic attitude attracts people teaching claims children... something like 25% teachers make past year 5... 1 year took get degree first place.

Ridiculous. Precisely point. None Mate edit post instead double post I’ve heard it’s made “great leader’s” tears 132% effective. biggest problem he’s strong wonderful he’s never cried. Nice Naw, ask isn’t wearing two masks.

Fauci gave great loophole deal people. Nobody gonna wear two masks. Fauci said to... actually cared “the science” “taking serious” wearing two masks. One n95.... Yeah fear uncertainty really fucked me. definitely working slowly exposure therapy like first would wipe groceries going surgery. less i'll set things aside day two. Used week could touch them, 2 days. know can't get covid way, know, hard get ocd truly believe company illusion means understand happening,""

This directed companies also governments feel like play dirty. read comment? people live with, contact with, children taken care elderly vulnerable individuals. teachers know concerned passing someone contact at-risk. again, middle aged healthy teacher community died Monday. Spare me. ones UK government owned, far know goes ones US. lmao yes. think takes prize cringiest ad era Haha, dicussion toxic meaningless. mention everything, socialize, bit crowded wait, things logical human would think mention? Face masks, honestly circus here, least I'll able shout friends laughs going provide schools financial material support needed open safely. America better europe feels weird American.

lmao get reddit. Circlejerking great Europe/Canada horrible US meme website point. experience Florida well. Zero cases transmission large school teachers begging come back. considered keeping kids home teachers reached asked would send face face would get better education. I'm grateful teachers care students community.  I’m definitely 100% behind vaccine, someone I’ve never met walks traffic asks stick needle arm, I’m going suspicious. still wide range better situations mass gatherings back. 

Here Michigan, back bars/restaurants open capacity indoors would major quality life improvement. 

If criterion improvement ""as pandemic never happened"", still far off. limit ""some/most daily freedoms back"" ETA much sooner. 

I also suspect big events require lot planning, they're hedging scenario put time resources event wind canceling anyway pandemic improve expected. UK 17 overseas territories dependent countries first, us 55,000 Turks &amp; Caicos alone I'm sick everyone's qualifiers whenever things.

""Don't worry masked up!""

""... Socially distanced, course!""

Also phrase ""mask up"" annoys end. No, all. Please delete comment give serious source. order Germany took secondary EU contract. EU country get vaccine later this. Well $$$ pay teachers teach children. Districts put tough situation. third mask? Good enough pandemic. data bear opinion out. CDC released great report yesterday. Yet could still spread disease. Vaccination isnt proven stop person person transmission problem something like really hard implement policy. say cops go around busting non-household gatherings fining everyone involved, really think they're going implement system still bust gatherings check every person see they're vaccinated sometimes go ""whoops, ok all""? would administrative nightmare, mention people would lie vaccinated.  currently evidence people vaccinated spread virus. Ya love OP frames that... like breaking news somberly report.

Guess else going happen? Someone get COVID die getting vaccine doses point... It’ll bullshit response. question is, reason last 12 months? EU beginning playing fair cared every country fair equal access vaccines. 
The USA UK put countries first, caring others. 
So accusing EU snatching everyone’s vaccine supply isn’t really correct. is. 100% decided definitely spreading without vaccine. Davies always seemed quietly competent, politician. even resigned seat matter principle (a stupid, quixotic matter principle, still). quoting poster responding to.
And yes understand poverty major factor onces life expectancy.
Poor disproportionately dying covid too.
That nothing calling person selfish saying said. It’s seasonal weather drives people indoors increases spread. cold winters north super hot summers south show huge spreading increases. scum thought vaccine wasn’t manufactured US. spreading FASTER winter summer. totally capable fast spread time year since r0 high. thought vaccine wasn’t manufactured US. NYT started new map shows likelihood getting Covid 80% country ""extremely high risk"". Meanwhile cases falling 48 states California areas removing restrictions cases hospitalizations falling fast.

""Extremely high"", compared what? Seems like NYT making new metric report bad news. US actually pretty well. serious hiccups early since 2 weeks ago things started going much smoother. 

Obviously expect even better US shaping one leading countries come thing April-July timeframe. exceedingly likely health care worker, person giving vaccine already.  teacher- say 0 transmission schools mean it’s true. say city too- despite 90% cases coming known source. 

Looking graph data shows clear link school open cases skyrocketing. First time see hug friends (nearly year now), I’m going ugly cry. guarantee  elderly get gotten vaccines. know people allergic immunocompromised - like many elderly.

Maybe makes feel good take people. Lol. It’s weird. Stay here....not true. people vaccinated less likely one person become infected infection will/can occur vaccine 100 percent effective. Vaccines become effective majority population vaccinated. residents workers vaccinated elder residents much safer infection. Surprised pikachu face. Nice hope start tend Pretty strong evidence proposition

Where?

COVID surging year round. Summer holiday? Spike. Fall holiday? Spike. Winter holiday? Spike.

It's seasonal. everyone saying something like ""putting needles arms"" like people understand difference distribution administering? something need write representatives done? vaccines sitting one understands cares also administered? this? telling this? really give fuck public health people saying, get vaccine game me. People super paranoid stay inside long want miserable - I'll enjoying drinks friends *without* mask, guidelines damned. I'll hopping plane go see aging in-laws.

Partial demand, partial reallocation resources towards vaccines. thanks China. good.   whole point is, binary thing. absolutely reduce transmission, question much.

It's actual disease, placeholder name encourage preparedness. pharma CEO allowed recommend zero scientific evidence back up. trials delayed 2nd doses. die completely blue feel fine get sick die heart attack something, that's common, would ironic happened right got vaccine

You need Google things randomly spewing opinions facts:
Literally first hit:
* One person dies every 36 seconds United States cardiovascular disease. 655,000 Americans die heart disease year (1,795 per day)—that's 1 every 4 deaths..*
CVD = cardiovascular disease, includes heart attack.

So you’re saying literally 0 1,795 vaccine day? every day last month since we’ve giving out, single one?

I’m going break math won’t understand it. Suffice say it’s “ironic,” literally statistics confluence obvious, unrelated, sequential life events. “feels” irrelevant.

Go ahead look cases (there aren’t any). 
This isn’t even worth discussing unless pattern. work around dangerous aerosols wear types PPEs regular basis. difference negligible according whom? NIOSH ratings exist reason, backed rigorous testing. seriously doubt anyone make similar claims cloth masks, matter constructed fitted. 

BTW, N95s considered minimum protection. spend enough time contaminated environment utility quickly drops zero. people need understand *95* *N95* likelihood particle make given moment. long enough timeline likelihood exposed contaminant becomes certainty. Yeah, issue first 20% people get vaccinated going much bigger impact deaths hospitalizations last 20%. mean open earlier theoretical herd immunity. bold move AZ piss market size EU. Regardless right case would imagine AZ would trying appease EU best ability, rather adding fuel fire interview CEO last night. thought would take 18-24 months product safe, effective vaccine.

To fair, vaccines produced done looser circumstances would normally do. Thus emergency use authorization. still gone full FDA approval yet, studies shorter normally complete. 

furthermore, even scenarios, looking close 18 months AZ Novavax. teachers duty, morning kids leave. come in, groups, never 6ft apart!!!! Lunch time even worse. Never 6ft apart. VP one taking care school. Principal sits desk. I'm totally convinced PTO runs everything!!!

1. Sanofi delayed late 2021 accurate date, even ends working (failed stage 2 trials). produce Pfizer vaccines, perhaps they're giving homegrown one.
2. Pfizer-BioNtech production problems. They're ramping production Belgium plant, work increase production done causes 2-3 weeks delays, extra production make end Q1, supply extra that. recommending unions step help teachers? fluers coping avoidance.

A valid concern. still seems better county doing: one site serving 350,000 people ~400 sq. mile area. think long follow local restrictions, fine party like 1999. now, don't, GFY suck, whatever saves people guess Lol! put past him. soup salad good. last time pasta dish beyond pathetic almost 30 dollars.

Its covid thing hopefully stops covid longer thing. lot doctors, especially Attendings hospitals old super conservative. fear politics combine lot sense goes window. Florida teachers calling sick arecforced chose either come use vacation days instead sick days. mom's (a teacher) collegue forced tge school vome work high fever COVID symptoms wating test results. Guess whose test results came back positive day later? work public school? suggest preach others reality don’t live reality. that's headline submitted says, I'm making sure making false comparisons. I'd appreciate corrected comments spreading misinformation. mean neither lol yeah moronic. pessimistic everything COVID related anyone saying people shouldn’t gatherings everyone vaccinated? literally nothing else wait point. fucking horrible watching colleagues families catch virus could avoided. Add probably 20000 number afraid say anything. Teachers work terrified. pushing schools open state testing lining lobbyists pockets! disgrace. want stay home extra year people like resist going fun getting infected. thing is, EU delayed negotiations signed late. Months contracts UK already signed concrete delivery schedule.

It's possible point, AZ give concrete promises due uncertain nature future production existing obligations. 3 months prepare manufacturing capabilities deliveries UK Q1, EU perhaps much choice point. Fingers crossed, also live state people seem really anti-vax addition even anti-mask. We’re still stuck “the flu deadly, COVID worldwide fakeout hurt Trump” mindset. Yes, still. I’m pretty worried. Even US starts better overall, may lagging behind. Great Plague confused Black Death (of 1347), killed estimated 30%-ish-ish (figures run 20% 60%) population England.

Though, caused bacteria, Yersinia Pestis.

In 17th century, London densely packed cesspool decaying food, animals, human waste lining streets especially poorer parts city, plague killed \~100k people 1665 1666 thanks largely part conditions well lack treatment medical knowledge today.

500 years later, viral respiratory disease killed roughly amount people UK whole even modern sanitation, medical know-how, ventilators, medicines, treatment methods within less year since first death UK recorded. Though it'll end smaller share total population killed disease 500 years ago plague, Covid go history among others part able still much damage even though benefits modern medicine, communications systems, vaccine technology, everything else dealt last great pandemic (1918) came could never even dream of. user unknown gender pontificating about. think u need break sub homie Oh Jesus even vaccinations gonna see death statistics drop while? Sucks.  Ok genius. think it'll over? im gonna say standard reigon... sounds standard Thousands people also developing mental illness, killing themselves, losing jobs, losing homes, etc. can't stay shut forever. think necessarily selfless. think explanation simple: Even billionaire realizes die forgotten long run spending money buying reputation posterity. “Just move” solution anything fucking pisses off. First off, it’s classic example shifting impetus responsibility exploiter exploited - typical capitalist bullshit. Second, it’s immensely disrespectful emotional ties place people might have. Third, suggests won’t find solution problems run away them.

Are conservative? Cause sounds like conservative type solution, “If don’t like it, leave”  Powecom KN95s referring to. ARUN also legit one. hope lift stuff easter, think actually could part point. Lifting things earlier making people scared going getting vaccinated may way drive people get vaccinated saying ""look, checking people dying record numbers. want dumb go early get covid get vaccinated, fault now"" Weird, google maps shows 20. stand corrected welcome stay home afford saying straight. 100,000 people died due incompetence government. Sorry gonna get away classing 'historical misfortune' area. putting little germ factories back germ distribution centers pandemic great idea. many fake KN95 online. ones could buy, passed CDC tests Powecom KN95. KN95 before, obvious fakes (too thin, holes them, impossible fit) Send army board nationalize immediately Well, repub leading state expect. Sad taking seriously. Antibody build jabs? countries delaying 6 weeks according AZ. people appalled Trump alarmed would using power presidency push treatment proof working. hope would look like idiot bonus. two sides equal. One pushing false hope amid global pandemic. side knew dangerous. Personally rejecting CDC report hand, believe half-capacity school openings masks mitigation place relatively safe.

That said, think concerns reasonable people may have:

- presume cases children asymptomatic, confident cases captured testing data? not, schools driving invisible spread?

- let's put aside say there's invisible spread. Success far ""hybrid"" model construed justify opening near-to-full capacity, many advocating for, would mean sacrificing distancing mitigation.

- New coronavirus variants said spread easily, case mitigation needed, less. According facebook, went dinner TWICE birthday last year. Two lovely dinners restaurants. One glorious king crab buffet lovely local spot.

It’s stupid. keep kn95 mask face shield on, stay least 6 feet students, pray survive get vaccine. teachers really screwed. ""Best effort"" superseded. Best effort means exact dates amounts fixed, vendor needs nearly everything reasonable power fulfil contract.

""Best effort"" deals quite usual thing new products developed yet. one say sure product ready marketed. soon, time comes, vendor needs make sure rollout happens stated contract. Christ dude, there’s excuse open schools vulnerable vaccinated. 

There excuse open EVERYTHING vulnerable vaccinated California gets shit closing schools, ones rigorously monitor possible COVID cases lockdown, don’t things , get scenes utter stupidity. adjusted population it’s even outlier compared countries. honestly dont believe doctors, news people, politicians saying anything similar. Maybe better idea whole situation live mess shits gotten way way worse everytime anybody lied said getting better trajectory towards better times.

It's pretty sickening neither party seems give shit working poor anymore, least US.  see may better idea. I'm PA allowed every Mom &amp; Pop pharmacy apply vaccine, seems good surface. 

The problem 20 different small pharmacies got 200 doses, backed EVERYONE submitted 20 different waiting lists. number duplicate applications across pharmacies ridiculous &amp; holding things up.

I would rather State contract something like send 4000 doses single provider 1 master waiting list. Florida did. High population counties enacted mask mandates early pandemic state government wouldn’t. Oh yeah agree really think it'll happen. mean, talks earlier year ticketmaster going require vaccinations events people went berserk even 24 hours later rolled back claim lol

It's even I'm anti-vax anything, think that's massive violation freedom honestly quite dystopian EU also spent 7 times less UK US, per capita, grants vaccine development, manufacturing. that, also took sweet time deliver.

I’m planning wedding masks distancing gone. won’t die wait want fun day. article:

The future funerals likely remain virtual form fashion even pandemic over, according Colorado funeral directors.

They say process hosting service online going smoothly now, many Coloradans simply requesting they’re even offered.

“Never million years think I’d families sign release Facebook Live livestream,” said Andrea Thomas, General Manager T.G. McCarthy Funeral Home Imperial Funeral Home &amp; Cemetery Pueblo, Colorado.

The funeral business $20 billion industry. 

At beginning pandemic, much concern many people could attend service person really stressed lot Coloradans out.

But appears anxiety subsiding. Another example failure educational system. glad this! wish people would. keeping going chain! Forgive I’m ignorant, I’m sure relevant point is. summer general public real concrete idea vaccine would even ready variants didn’t really change situation since mask social distancing already place. may slightly relaxed spring still far normal normal year. They're producing UK stopped EU demanding supply. true mate. AZ obligation EU make ""best effort"" deliver time, done.

That's works. definitions contract specify exactly ""best effort"" means 100% sure contract goes details reports following

Reuters access contract. one except EU AZ has.

But CureVac contract case delays anticipated availability ***Product***, ***contractor*** aims allocate ***doses*** ***Product*** fairly across demand ***doses***, ***contractor*** contractually commit towards present future customers, ***doses*** become called question course, questions first directed sub contractor actually producing vaccines. plants actually owned operated AZ.

True, still EU ask AZ contract AZ. AZ resposibility monitor subcontractors already answer EU. otherwise serious management issues since EU took sweet time signing agreement AZ, makes sense less time iron supply chain production EU. 

AZs first CDMO Novasep Belgium. can't enough time fix processes. Plus, Novasep's part production process one barely supply chain issues. fill-finish really run supply-chain challenges.

So guess production issue yields low something screwed (like temperature dirt got system). signing contract mean funds got allocated right away, especially scale unknown prior signing contract EU. 

The scale known well advance contract signing. Basically CDMO contracts signed quite early AZ. 

Also, clear beginning whoever could deliver doses would able sell market. also export ban vaccines UK, AZ would need asinine accept clause.

Ah! would true blocker. Pfizer issue since US since can't export anything, EU accept that.

But UK uncooperative could backfire since vaccine production facilities raw material production EU countries. Would EU also ban exports, UK could lose access Moderna Pfizer vaccines immediately even risk production AZ vaccine UK.

Until now, EU plays fair regard UK receives lot doses production sites within EU. Let's hope EU also switch ""EU first"" strategy like US UK. I'm worried either. Philadelphia home venerated medical institutions country. Yet came time set city’s first largest coronavirus mass vaccination site, officials turned start-up Philly Fighting COVID, self-described “group college kids” minimal health-care experience.

Chaos ensued.

Seniors left tears finding appointments they’d made bungled sign-up form wouldn’t honored. group switched for-profit model without publicizing change added privacy policy would allow sell users’ personal data. One volunteer alleged 22-year-old CEO pocketed vaccine doses. Another described “free-for-all” unsupervised 18- 19-year-olds vaccinated one another posed photos.

Now, city cut ties Philly Fighting COVID, prosecutors looking “concerning” allegations.

The group offered partial apology Tuesday defending switch for-profit status, CEO Andrei Doroshin told Philadelphia magazine claims helped leftover vaccine doses “baseless.”

Just weeks ago, Philly Fighting COVID receiving glowing coverage likes NBC’s “Today.” group compelling story: Doroshin, graduate student Drexel University, helped orchestrate effort use 3-D printers make free face shields hospital workers start pandemic. summer, friends running pop-up testing sites citywide.

But Philadelphia magazine reported, group’s “executive team” lacked anyone medical degree advanced degree public health. Doroshin listed résumé included stints teaching high school film class, producing videos people longboarding practicing parkour, founding nonprofit that, according Philadelphia magazine, “mostly consisted meme-heavy Twitter account, minor community lobbying, fundraiser $50,000 goal netted $684.”

Speaking “Today,” Doroshin said lack traditional public health background allowed “think little differently” speed vaccination process. another interview, expressed hopes setting McDonald’s-like franchise suggested best practices administering vaccine doses “can go window.”

Philly Fighting COVID’s young, entrepreneurial leaders also openly talked potential profit, one former volunteer told WHYY: “They bragging rich going get.” Another volunteer said group’s executives “said gonna millionaires” billing insurance providers administering vaccine doses Philly Fighting COVID got free. (Doroshin disputed allegations.)

The city’s partnership group began drawing scrutiny last week WHYY reported Philly Fighting COVID abruptly backed plans host coronavirus testing clinics predominantly Black Latino neighborhoods “completely ghosted” community leaders, one pastor put it. Then, Saturday, dozens seniors lined hours vaccinated Pennsylvania Convention Center turned away group accidentally allowed many people sign up.

“There literally 85-year-old, 90-year-old people standing tears, printed appointment confirmations, saying: ‘I don’t understand can’t get vaccinated. I’m 85,’ ” one witness told station.

A registered nurse volunteered group categorized “disaster operation.” Katrina Lipinsky told Philadelphia Inquirer WHYY wasn’t asked medical credentials began administering vaccine doses, plenty unused doses left seniors turned away Saturday. alleged saw Doroshin place 10 15 doses bag take left.

The 22-year-old CEO attended small gathering friends night, according WHYY, photo circulated Snapchat appeared show “getting ready administer unspecified syringe” individual private home.

Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said Tuesday briefing allegations “very disturbing” true, leftover vaccine doses returned city. also said “in retrospect” mistake partner group.

The city announced Monday would longer work Philly Fighting COVID coronavirus testing vaccine distribution, day allegations mishandled vaccine doses surfaced. decision sever ties made health officials became aware group switched for-profit status, Farley said Tuesday.

Farley also cited concerns group’s privacy policy, first raised WHYY. weeks, Philly Fighting COVID collected data tens thousands Philadelphians seeking vaccine appointments without telling information could used. privacy policy finally appeared group’s website last week, contained provisions would allow Philly Fighting COVID sell users’ personal data third party.

In Tuesday statement, Doroshin called inclusion language “mistake” said removed. “We never never would sell, share, disseminate data collected would violation HIPAA rules,” wrote.

Doroshin also apologized “any miscommunications” Philly Fighting COVID switched focus testing vaccines, said never intended “cause confusion harm.” group lacked resources handle testing vaccinations time, said, adding becoming for-profit company necessary “scaling up.”

But elected officials still questions. Tuesday, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (D) asked anyone knowledge potential criminal activity contact office, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) invited Philadelphians felt misled Philly Fighting COVID open complaint. Multiple city council members called investigation, Inquirer reported, want know inexperienced college students placed charge crucial task first place.

Notably, everyone Philly Fighting COVID’s executive team White, reported Philadelphia magazine — fact raised eyebrows city struggled vaccinate substantial Black population, (Philadelphia roughly 44 percent Black, 12 percent vaccine doses gone Black people far.) city also home Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, pioneered one earliest efforts conduct coronavirus testing communities disproportionately affected virus.

You’re wrong Australia, America’s done god awful job containing virus minimizing deaths. Deal already. I've read reaction numbers similar vaccines. Differential like 1 2 people. Sure, lot likely kid get covid day care go parents working full time overcrowded offices. know, parents...

Everything risks, I'm comfortable slightly increased risk covid child vs benefit relationship grandparents I’ve already seen anti-Vader’s flip logic justify won’t vaccinated. point masks still required, low risk group, risk taking new vaccine? Yh vaccine give immunity straight away first days definitely possible still get infected. mean usually vaccinate people prevent pandemic we're vaccinate people middle pandemic exactly ideal. Although risk would probably fairly low since imagine would either vaccinate administering vaccine maybe test regular basis. Plus wear masks etc. course allow anyone symptoms come give vaccine. exactly remember long immunity takes think around week two good amount immunity build 

lets say think fluke countries handling best - New Zealand, Taiwan, Australia, Iceland etc one country islands. strawman argument make thoughts actions someone disagree with, order make easy argue point. Nobody likes shut downs. Nobody likes hours cut work. Nobody likes quit job stay home kids school closed. NOBODY LIKES THIS, grow up.

And 'cold harsh truth' one persons SELFISH opinion. important anyone else Yh vaccine give immunity straight away first days definitely possible still get infected. mean usually vaccinate people prevent pandemic we're vaccinate people middle pandemic exactly ideal. Although risk would probably fairly low since imagine would either vaccinate administering vaccine maybe test regular basis. Plus wear masks etc. course allow anyone symptoms come give vaccine. looking vaccination rates uk looks better mainland.

Almost makes one jealous BREXIT'ing. one main reasons respond quickly vaccines. depend outrageously slow, bureaucratic organ called EU. business.

I saying European. EU hogging us greatly effective response.

Get it. ""About us"" section website: 

"" We’re global education business. started print 100 years ago Times Educational Supplement. Fast forward today we’ve grown partnership teachers schools around world become one largest, professional digital communities, connecting supporting 13 million educators globally. ""

Read first sentence paragraph again. There's big banner home page links to.. guessed it, ""Live News Blog: Coronavirus schools"" wanted add anaphylaxis easily treatable people watching prepared treat it. (Which are.) puts minds ease. sure odds dying Covid age I'll wager still higher 2 million. initial vaccination second shot. separate third shot currently development.   well known figure educate yourself: unions touting study well. Id like see data combative doesnt fit narrative? article borderline disinfo. 

Without serious numbers aerosol emission rates contagious virus, base claims.
We knew infection dose old strains, done weeks ago new ones.
Viral emission rate studies always missing decent first-phase patient numbers, though.

There documented cases looks bit like people got infected minutes aerosols.
On hand, grocery store workers see dozen infectious Covid cases per day.

So without numbers, can't take ""expert"" opinions seriously. Aerosol infections could still rare thing. 

I believe aerosol main route, pickup, hunch, nothing could back solid data.

How reduce infections know people infect others? followed advice everything

Australia taken advice anything. Australia followed advice Chief Medical Officer medical experts, whose advice well ahead everything. Especially early critical stages pandemic January March 2020 states like Georgia would expect full normal end April including concerts sports games etc. honestly got early mid March risk opening goes dramatically JNJ doses start given cant far know. reached me. vaccine it’s called education media reports facts sensationalize everything count it. Georgia still one areas entire pandemic. Norway EU end 17 million. UK US plenty vaccines sell May July timeframe. particular 160 million doses Novavax 200 million doses Pfizer MRNA July August time frame. count it. Georgia still one areas entire pandemic. Mr whit wher cocainer Mr whit wher cocainer need get wage slaves back work; nothing else matters. health kids. Mr whit wher cocainer That's cool I'm planning mine June 2021. Think okay pal. makes sense though. Considering EU still approved it, would irresponsible to. Better use 4 million doses earlier 'repay' later.

so hearing now? many people trading tips re-use (often REALLY bad methods render mask ineffective)

one ""approved"" methods leave used mask hanging somewhere home least 7 days. uhuh. love idea mask hanging foyer covid it.

Does REALLY make sense? know. personally gone anywhere would require wearing kind mask since new mandate ordered. much. AZ help send us vaccines signed. Let see week everything develops. Sad weeks Europe :(

It matter AZ dropped Billion vials doorstep, EU authorised use, EU messed missed early ordering anyway. Hey live Arizona too. Despite ongoing pandemic, people done virus. don’t care get frequently see people without masks on. work Trader Joe’s one anti mask parades came store. Calling virus hoax, waving trump flags, single one mask on. Called cops immediately gone showed up.

 hate endure pandemic along people.  agree except part teachers. vast majority teachers working even longer hours year normally do, trying figure adapt curriculum engage remote students. Many teachers teach remote in-person students simultaneously, hell lot harder sounds uninitiated. teachers struggling hard parents are, many parents simultaneously teach care kids.

Source: school-based SLP also lurks lot r/teachers. Probably done scale before. districts forced buy third-party vaccines

What mean this? Biden asked Department Education Department Health Human Services **provide guidance safe reopening operating** schools, childcare providers, institutions higher education.

I go read actual executive order. What's reported sound like pushing everybody back immediately. come guidance / leadership safely. plan. Anything happening currently individual state plan. one ever said could reduced fatalities zero. One medical experts estimated low 10,000. Personally Uk kept contained first lockdown, I'd consider realistic improvement. ""A negligible effect"" said could massively contested considering...

I agree points, sure, arguing pointless. We'll never know going Madagascar would've curbed enough. However, could alot closer virus free worst hit country Europe measures taken stricter earlier.    I'll revive 4 months wrong.

RemindMe! 4 months Well kinda true. They're trying snatch everyone's vaccine. understand put citizens first. understand EU still allowing many vaccine exports really want put citizens first. Pfizer Moderna vaccines Canada UK come EU example. upvotes logical statement 10% fatality rate bit misleading significant outbreak. Given extremely low number cases (like 100 past 25 years), really worst case figure given plague patients typically take long go doctor and, there, take long diagnose early stage symptoms match closely typical flu (fever, aches, etc). famous boils/black skin issues typically appear late-stage (although lymph nodes almost always become noticeably inflamed bubonic variant.. easy confuse STDs ailments). average ER/family/urgent care doctor go entire lives without seeing case, even areas pseudo endemic really top mind them. data limited, early treatment antibiotics strongly correlated positive outcome (as opposed late-stage symptoms like active boils). 

Regardless, widespread awareness proactive treatment anti-biotics first sign infection would plummet mortality rate. course ignores hygiene advances we've made would stop major issue begin (which - intents purposes - effectively extinct US). either give shit pandemic, living rock.

That kind sociopathic disregard safety others plus heavy denial sounds like normal life US me! [hangs head shame] honestly think Planning wedding 26 days now. high risk guests already vaccinated it’s mostly outdoors. think okay. Oh absolutely. You’d think open carrying way people react lol AZ: Brit! one Yanks!

FDA:... India 3 million day brother complain school plenty reading reminds lucky it. Weekly testing, Bluetooth contact tracing tiles, strict mask protocols, reduced class sizes, real info sharing. tile says room someone tests positive 15 minutes, go quarantine list. We’ve quite cases year evidence transmission within building. Best luck there.  Yes terrible. example native Norway promised 1.1 million doses February delivery schedules everything. get 200,000 July. tragedy - luckily Pfizer deliver doses first promised offset this, herd immunity sure delayed month two. might sound like biggie countries like Norway, summer large celebration period meet family friends. company supplying 'at cost', can't see would ever agree binding timeframe.

I'm saying happen, would put risk AZ zero benefits. Several people typing... one comment pops up! Lol pandemic going last long despite vaccine.

This pandemic months vaccines (note plural). pandemic going last long despite vaccine.

This pandemic months vaccines (note plural). Apparently parties agree publish contract, there’s need wait AstraZeneca’s confirmation.
Anyway, stage think EU expects clarify demand met   much trouble, could link specific article? would live read it. here! I’ve teaching virtually 20% 30 students Covid- know of! still socializing friends family. Lots holiday parties travel. Students spending night other’s houses. definitely think taking seriously enough bet health life it! know man, silly joke looks like EU trying snatch everyone's vaccine supply order time. sequence every single sample? thing matter data percentage samples positive new variant samples tested. extrapolate general numbers. Thanks, know question bit hypochondriac What's end goal getting rid masks restrictions? ZERO cases? can't tolerate two years this. I'm fine mask wearing get vaccinated, can't forever. Imagine mask distance disease vaccinated for...an entire 2 years later.

Understand this...if still 2 years, forever.  Please don't... live border state stock pile meds use crazy juice really want Malaria neighbors dumbasses.

Plus sinus problems become awful help, mention I've put weight causes snore likely quality sleep... sigh. Just. Do. It. Well thing things disproved science and/or ridiculously stupid spreading misinformation obviously wrong. 

For instance, yeah debate whether certain types exercise better improving exercise ability, debate warranted, obviously dumb wrong think injecting bleach kill viruses body wearing masks actually makes sick. 

As much science debatable constantly changing, things obviously wrong be/have disproved. risk would think is, could get second dose? big risk even get second dose 5-6 weeks later likely change much. new hobbies, spend time kids missed on, read books, work guess ppl can't happy things normal complained busy complain busy enough.

This tells us everything need know you. think people protest they're bored home? Let eat cake, right? We'll definitely enough vaccines then, countries might slow administer them. (Unless J&amp;J and/or CureVac turn work.) read sources? clearly exist, therefore concept censorship limited courts.

When argue point, people hit back with, ""Well, everyone get vaccinated, so, ..."". people would like masks norm.

We lived decades surrounded viruses illnesses fatalities occurring almost every day tens thousands per year. ""normal"" 50,000 people die flu 350,000 people die nursing homes *every year*.

Has anyone else vaccinated attest situation? I’d like hear experience. know whether disappointed, relieved USA county psycho dipshits running around Looks like they're cancelling someone EU made up. Egg face mate. won't. Worst case scenario COVID vaccine becomes like flu shot get yearly October.

All Pandemics end. go 2023. agree. keep reading people talking Covid-19 forever think means restrictions masks forever. 

People need understand yes Covid-19 always thing, numbers right inline counted ""flu"". 

Some people need understand 30k 40k people die US due flu every year. Obviously that's far cry deaths Covid. think everybody realized yes people still die Covid going forward, deaths much lower require restrictions. think Covid deaths much lower flu simply many people get covid vaccine. Probably many usually get flu vaccine. never get flu vaccine I'm absolutely getting Covid one. people know feel way. Regarding people getting COVID getting shot, first all, difference 95% 100%. 95% effective, would expect 20x fewer people get COVID vaccination. That's zero.

You also careful random stories ""Some guy got vaccine next week got hit bus!"" fallacy called [post hoc ergo propter (""after this, therefore this"").

The truth people randomly get heart attacks time. start vaccinating millions people, get heart attacks next day simply *that happens sometimes* total coincidence gotten shot.

Here's really good short article people get confused [false side pay attention media stories instead careful scientific studies. Fucking THANK YOU! thoughts exactly data trials (and early reports Isreal well) suggest YES. vaccinated tested positive almost exclusively would considered ""mild"" illness/symptoms nearly 0 hospitalizations. definition controlled spread 25 outbreaks? thats good thing? virus kills 50% people infects? learn something new every day AZ might stuck rock hard place here, seeing UK contract (apparently) bars selling UK manufactured doses outside UK UK's demands met, EU contract (apparently) requires make best effort delivering EU (which EU's view, AZ may breached diverting EU supplies UK).

Ultimately AZ fucked. question want piss UK, want piss EU?

I think point way AZ, EU place export controls vaccines. AZ wring fingers throw EU bus delivering customers outside EU, simultaneously fulfilling obligations EU. brainwashing gone control. live households limited live there. agree sick part. I'm willing wear one I'm sick af. hated getting sick this. shot sight?  Well EU countries already calling ban vaccine exports European Commission currently thinking implementing mandatory registration vaccine export tighter regulations. there's significant chance something like happen.

Or talking EU supplying Canada UK. EU Pfizer production facility supplying UK Canadian Pfizer vaccines. mean, living part-time California, absolutely dragged stay-at-home order far longer seemed reasonable. (San Francisco closed OUTDOOR dining early December late January). Combine messaging ""keep masking distancing"" even vaccinated, feels like end sight. #People surprised: fucking nobody currently am.

Here's hoping new administration actually plan rolling vaccine, timeline destruction limited it. experts also saying worst over. Dr Osterholm known Dr Doom amongst colleagues reason. Profits CHILDREN, even worse. can't even protect children. Meh, actual phobia. it. mean avoid immunizations (because I'm goddamn adult), hate get done get super nervous. ""Fake till make it"" gone way far. guys take even they're faced reality keep going lie. Normally give point. New York Times article posted week ago featured healthcare workers *begging* media tone misleading discouraging reporting (e.g., “this one doctor somewhere died received vaccine,” “we still don’t know carry covid you’ve vaccinated,” “well there’s always chance you’ll get covid anyway,” etc.) would lead nothing people giving and/or turning snake oil salesmen conspiracy theorists. multiple safe effective vaccines nothing short marvel, hope articles like this. “what happens next shock you... click here” People drive like complete idiots even usual. Reportedly many traffic accidents fatalities even though far less cars road. statistics often happens ideally demographic?

My 80-something mother law got first Moderna shot days ago looking 2nd shot soon. CLICKBAIT HUH? ONE COMMENT: Donald Trump’s comments ingesting disinfectant could led major problems. Bruh, everywhere. literally announced yesterday shipping vaccine doses US, ""early"" said original 100 million doses 120 million due change. people US cheering, realizing what's actually happening we're screwed doses. science denier. superintendent telling us information similar this. “Look reopened classes cases!” think real data, think conclusion schools spread covid taking giant leap logic. private schools generally small number public schools open. obviously cases low schools schools opened. smaller school smaller number students attending, easier implement covid safety measures. Many large school districts don’t resources spread kids out, wash hands frequently, etc. far tell, nobody would disagree covid spread schools follow strict safety guidelines. Soooo yeah, denying science, expressing healthy skepticism. hopefully competent leader White House trying ordering millions vaccine timeline drastically decrease. spend many days COVID units rarely go rooms. didn’t qualify phase 1 vaccine I’m signed phase 2 hopefully next month. People teach never get lol miss shit really seems like must enormous amount underreporting schools though. don’t see can’t be. Kids much less likely get tested yet still spread asymptomatically. There’s likely large population asymptomatic spreaders schools. 

At university, example, around 50,000 people including faculty staff. test 1,000 people week. What’s more, people getting tested generally ones take seriously (and regularly take tests, driving positivity rate), positivity rate low. Fraternities sororities like actively discouraging members getting tested, even they’re presenting symptoms. several thousand students regularly flout guidelines probably likely tested. Elementary, middle, high schools facing similar issues regard apathy towards student testing. data simply can’t used draw conclusion class safe, yet done so.

I agree need take CDC report seriously definitely follow science this, seems like bad - least weak - science me. logic high vaccination rate ultimately stop pandemic therefore, ""stop"" restrictions, concerts, festivals, clubs would never thing, since never high vaccination rate black death...

Lets face it, western society go back normal without herd immunity vaccines, least Europe vaccination slow.

At point, bound happen psychosocial necessity. strike lose state teaching license.

The educators state quit start school, admission limited students parent licensed teacher. rest state figure educate majority children, families teachers flourish eventually take levels government state.

I suppose leave 10% school open ""non-teacher families"" charge $35,000 year attend. hope right, lockdowns used matter *first* resort, fear precedent set. work environments, choose hours agree wearing KN95s

No, least wearing full face respirators P100s. Heck going dealing dangerous aerosols extended period, going trust P100, wear supplied air respirator PAPR system, standard medical professionals dealing COVID patients.

KN95s N95s standard everyone engaged brief transactions. lack emotional intelligence.

They can't see things people's POV go ""what would them?"" truth donate charity billionaires. Therefore, Gates agenda.

why fucking bother forever, short longer. 400k dead worse things listed.  school district defined ""close contact"" within 6' 15 minutes, rules one allowed within 6' except quick passing, therefore one ever close contact school one exposed school. far gone okay K-2 students person couple hours per day, we'll see keeps older kids going back. Unprecedented times makes physically cringe article reports ""showed elevated brain levels coronavirus five six days initial infection""

Meaning 1000x times infection phenomenon occurs 5-6 days contracting virus.

A vaccine preventative, would destroy virus. Vaccines designed prepare body encountering virus order help better defend infection Household bubbles already allowed. exact size varies location. new variants doom kick :( fully vaccinated unlucky enough 5% gets infected anyways, would vaccine prevent severe Covid? Kind like flu shots lessen severity flu even prevent infection? That's I've wondering really found answers yet.  much different two people already recovered virus hanging hugging honestly. I’m talking people say “I’m pretty sure already it,” I’m talking people lab confirmed cases recovered. type party Define 'allowed'. think restriction hanging private residences anyone right Yes, easily available online even supermarkets! seen low 1.6 Euros per FFP2 mask coffee shop train station. Well yeah everyone somehow stop talking flattening curve fact lasted month two.

Somehow whole thing morphed from, socially distance wear mask flatten curve we'll deal consequences, to, wear mask suck causing 1000's deaths per day.

I think people idea everyone wore damn mask illness death. completely unrealistic. Well surely AZ contract EU contradicts something UK contract AZ's fault signing contract supply EU knew honour time This. time get behind wheel car die. Anytime get elevator die. Flying, working out, swimming, even showering slip die. world always risk every day every citizen. Boden administration actually deal economic effects. freaking universal healthcare looming medical debt crisis? Ah kidding Biden bail insurance companies bailing people's medical debts. wish ppl would see light! Screw sit Mcdonalds! healthcare, pay job security. Order food local restaurants get corporate Merica cities town. Buy local Unlike US, spread everywhere border closed. British here. everything always come Brexit nationalism?

This issue caused lengthy red tape EU chugged make order vaccine (halting attempts member states earlier take control itself). set anything quarter year UK did, instead relying value EU-made vaccines never came fruition. hard catch 3 months anything, nevermind continent-scale vaccination programme.

The vaccines exported EU UK fulfil supply contract UK made vaccine provider. contract dictates UK-made vaccine gets UK priority everyone seemed fine time. guys complaining doses vaccine that, right now, would still sat shelf waiting approval, instead actually saving lives. 

This issue seeing Britain nationalist anti-EU entity driver behind lot this. Frankly, EU fucked up. easiest scapegoat UK. guys currently hate us already. easy sell nationalist brexit-loving UK vaccinating people vaccines made EU; rather fessing failings working resolve problem together. continue face masks vaccine, want know know long? Funny they'll hard time answering. Im living US county 1 15 people contracted virus state one hug flare cases.

Must nice live developed country . Last time talked cousin living Sydney, said he's going watch New Year's Eve fireworks. Fml Yeah bro, guarantee America 350M dead end March. Every country new cases next week so, America way worse everywhere else world. Take things hear sub grain salt. Occasionally expert comes talks, folks read headline think they’re genius. safety concerns there?? Millions people vaccine 2 adverse reactions two nurses. Surely acceptable number, think atleast US people sides aside know damn well lockdowns restrictions matters last resort.

Their great grandparents learned back century ago work data have, however inadequate may agree certainly is. made getting data difficult.

In US pushing study 17 rural schools Wisconsin justify reopening: [CDC know Puerto Rico part US right?  I'm rejecting science fit narrative much sitting classroom two likely COVID cases way rules written, allowed children get tested. see sick kids allowed come back school without negative COVID test, I'm believing anything. Based see classroom, along classrooms five teachers different grade levels different districts. state law allowing inaccurate counting. Looking thread, seem better parts country. changes, can't believe data set accurate. 25 ebola outbreaks around world last 50 years. sound like controlled you? large contingent sub high school kids? internet weird place immunologists neuroscientists sub 9th graders. Yeah interesting theory. would certainly expect Biden's team touch J&amp;J like daily know going official announcement. opposed Trump found current events Fox News. Sure, lived life trying make every decision tiny percentage, none us would ever leave home literally anything [You undercook fish? Believe not, vaccine. economic impacts worried. Capitalism worst. Major corporations billionaires made like bandits meanwhile inequality poverty gone way up. world going much worse volatile place. clear nothing change. even make America get universal healthcare bosses go back demanding everyone come sick. pathetic hopeless. obvious world never change basic dignity introduced. That's incorrect. vaccines 95% effective preventing disease. vaccine 100% perfect, pretty darn close it. teacher three days?

""They feeling sick.""

Not COVID, done done! side knew dangerous.

Negative. time still investigated. masks barely work lots negative effects hopefully find better alternative masks next pandemic. terms symptomatic infections 95% concerned people remain hermits incredibly long periods time waiting 100% safe. 

If someone wants remain shut means go ahead. 

I concerned people wanting shut us *all* next winter COVID flares up, bad flu season hits.

We need make sure lockdowns &amp; restrictions become normalized. know post something stupid everyone see lack education? monitoring export vaccines ensure suppliers can't meet EU commitments sure suppliers' exports foreign countries also effected rate. 

As Pfizer separate company AZ long Pfizer able supply EU vaccines still export want. EU made indication hold back one type vaccine (in case Pfizer) order make shortage another vaccine (AZ). British press somehow figured supplies Pfizer AZ related somehow fact not. Two different contracts, two different levels commitment. get three free ones pharmacy 65. Damn sucks. supposed vacation portugal summer US summer 2020 (obv happen), remember checking covid numbers time impressed done much better lot surrounding european countries spring. seems like sadly every country super strict lockdown/is island eventually gets hit hard point born raised Illinois, state well known shit state government. moved Oklahoma absolutely gobsmacked incredible ignorance stupidity saw OK state government. stupid Okie stupid, basically self righteous aggressive form stupid. surprised OK governor this. Okies elect morons part. Indeed. Educators country lied everyone. lied President, lied administration, lied communities...everyone made promises, promises empty, intended keep quiet complacent. educators country learned valuable lesson faith trust authorities. Ultimately, look situation determine appear safe, even face superiors telling otherwise, moral obligation protect best-interests. Hello Remember predictions US see 150,000 deaths January? Well, upto 26th we've 80,000 Americans die. gotta classify prediction unwarranted scaremongering, no? Who's still scared shots? like something pre teens younger? Let’s re-open schools. Seriously. parents seen one year old child basically since birth. done vaccination series, coming visit going hold grandbaby. Thank brother. mom cancer. seen year. go clinic cancer treatment. people like saving life. others go fuck themselves. link states death rates among teachers higher, infection rates aren't. get vaccine, get seriously ill covid.

Probably won't.  There's still tiny percent work right. We'd also see UK contract AZ. says UK paid premium/guarentee get priority... two contracts different. mRNA vaccines (the Pfizer Moderna ones) help body make little spike proteins (those things stick side virus) immune system knows look for. actual virus vaccines all, blueprint one chunk virus body recognize.

Think like posting ""WANTED"" posters town coronavirus. part virus, actual thing.

[Link CDC WTF wrong her? Even virus (very low chance first place), aren’t transmitting anyone maintaining social distancing massive margain.  Tell media social media lol — White House Coronavirus Coordinator Jeff Zients saying Biden administration’s first formal briefing pandemic officials always hew science level public. NEW DELHI — India vaccinated 2 million health workers less two weeks recorded 12,689 new coronavirus positive cases past 24 hours, sharp decline peak level nearly 100,000 mid-September. Nearly 300 new cases came Seoul metropolitan area, home half country’s 51 million people, infections tied various places, including churches, restaurants, schools offices.  We'll blame stress. Yay, Teamwork! think we've see others argument agree. I'm sure seen counters elsewhere I've seen yours. 

I think we've gotten far we're going to.

Have pleasant day. 🙂 people who've taking things seriously continue late spring/early summer. That's kinda deadline sensible people since that's told got vaccine rollout.

The people care never already gotten sick. unless new variants cause reinfection already bit herd immunity among morons. mean life. Nothing ever 100% also said need 500 million vaccines immediately fight Ebola. 

He’s known Dr Doom reason. Oh know original quote, changing words make point easily see true.

Just knew could get away anything, including murdering someone... people loved much loyal him, likewise people loved much loyal they'd anything asked, including murder. also spend months dithering trying bargain cost price vaccine. I'd let Pfizer get away it, contingency provide extra cost enough special syringes extract 6th dose every vial shipped out. can't that, extra dose exist, charged accounted pledged agreed upon shipment tallies.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah what’s issue here? thought known thing could still get Covid one dose, something like 80% effective. think two doses, moderna vaccine like 95% effective. That’s herd immunity important everyone (who able) needs get it. elected president today, would end corona US? Someone else made comment really fits - Fines poor people. rich love money, part fine another ""check"" write. someone like $900 would devastating. You’re definitely going people wanting wear one every winter. I’m also mind won’t last pandemic see life (mid 20s) maybe I’ll hear haha sad. people sending children Petri dishes covid. feel bad kids teachers. mixed hospital's department. thing sore arm, two call following day. covid19 biggest market world. Letting country ""queue jump"" hurt long run. Theyed stop signing contracts terms, current ones complete.  talking client mine who's Texas. got call child's elementary School someone school tested positive daughter ""close contact"" person person's name going revealed her. finds someone else daughter's teacher tested positive. called school said ""close contact"" specifically defined within 6 ft someone 15 minutes **no mask on**. Since times students teacher wear mask classroom technically never ""close contact"". 🤦‍♂️ Yes exactly local school. EU wants contract published.  two people completely vaccinated, waited appropriate time, allowed hang private residence. 

I think messaging would go much increasing amount people want get vaccinated. Poor people love hate rich, successful people. I'm 50's, wayyyy back giving OS away free giving millions schools many conspiracies evil, antichrist. seems equivalent ignorant villagers thinking someone knowledge special skill ""witch"" persecutes accordingly. Yea that’s starts. Doesn’t mean conclude quickly. work government get updates health department directly. I’m aware phases. still estimating two years get everyone. Also says UK variant completely control, escalation transmission quite striking 

This article written 10 days ago, cases UK falling steadily since then. Good thing school district taking things seriously, district much larger ours. Fml exact article. losers! 100% safe never here!!!!!!! It’s never 100% safe world never be. would nice also true Canada rather opposite work LH, Darden corp owns LH, OG, restaurants actually good. use health insurance seems good restaurant industry. plus started getting paid sick leave paid us first weeks march everything shut saying good - amazing - factored summer one country island. Much easier deal - mention nearly size states 1/10 population. Exactly. UK demands production EU shocked answer also NO. spit coffee keyboard... damnit! EU claiming contract AZ says something say. EU said AZ contract ""confidential"" really shocking failure-to-communicate thing first AstraZeneca representatives neglected mention crucial development: Two days earlier, company quietly halted trials vaccine around world, including late-stage study United States. acted participant Britain fell hours conference call, story broke halted trials. key F.D.A. officials heard news, according people knowledge discussions.

That's really good way earn trust regulators! Yeah, really feels like everything opened late spring/summer US. Even quite herd immunity, case/hospitalization/death rates going low it'll really hard justify continuing lockdown school (in Missouri), admin spent lot time measuring desks exactly 6 feet apart. 6 feet cutoff notifying students possible exposure. 5'11"" they'll notify student quarantine, there's apparently magic barrier 6 feet.

Of course, teachers notified all. governments doesn’t prepare next one, suck. bidets wants kids school smh 🤦 Fair enough. judging works individually, yes, whole would agree you, person rotten. listen science says wear mask stay home. that's need do. can't bad anti-vaxers. repeating AZ saying. Let show part contract clearly stated. 

We're cutting line. want sell non-Europeans enough ourselves. That's basis trade, trade excess goods. Pretty much us too, living house since last March. seen son year, seen mom year, seen sister year. sucks. feel like ""uncompliant"" fucked everyone else. Hope fun. Oh well. zero risk sentiment? know single country practicing mindest.

Even country like Spain, ridiculously stringent lockdown sprint 2020, varies state state, even though states dumb rules, things continue quite bit exposure risk.

I see redditors verge declaring whole thing conspiracy theory, quite balls lack shame, shake head. Missouri, school board voted return classes, despite lengthy discussions &amp; pleas parents &amp; staff remain virtual. biggest issue board— threats feds losing funding remaining virtual. Actually stated there’s currently legislation works defund districts choose remain virtual learning. 

When that’s reality coming down, many people blame crisis. It’s truly disgusting. 

Teachers done absolute best &amp; phenomenal; city stepped &amp; purchased hot spots ensure students could reached virtually. Also provide meals delivered neighborhoods make sure kids went without. 

There massive shortage qualified staff; typically pool 500+ subs available, it’s double digits. two high schools Covid19 testing sites. 

But funding threats higher ups seemed made board finally give &amp; return seat learning. numbers haven’t changed, still sadly high &amp; getting higher daily. It’s almost offensive community done help kids safe this.

Absolutely grotesque way things handled. Lol must fucking joking. yup, running sidewalk mask, lady walking dog wearing N95 San Francisco SCREAMED cursed out. Jeez, outdoors far apart! area everyone one times staired wearing one alone outdoors post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, shit? That's kind whole point getting vaccinated... link study article vaccine research? argument misleading... vaccine ultimately going stops it. question many die vaccines stop it. Yes, people would inclined stay covid like 200x deadly. not, response proportionate seriousness disease. wasn’t wake call get fuck education unless drastic changes happen real quick, don’t know is. Even decade ago, getting ready graduate high school, told I’d love teach entire system makes say way hell. last decade, somehow, got even worse. source comparison Sweden? hope great day well. doubt New York City opens much June July. Rest country open earlier besides maybe California Honestly think lot Bill Gates huge proponent vaccines, large anti-vax group. 

If convinced vaccines poison/extermination devices, makes sense someone essentially made life goal vaccinate many people 3rd world countries possible, looks like trying cull population. 

The core issue anti-vax movement think. understand they’re though. acted slowly regards AZ poured lot money Sanofli vaccine failed, people (rightfully) angry. AZ let think EU also partially trying pass blame poor vaccine decisions

Exactly this. media overflowing blame aimed suppliers (gleefully parroted national politicians deflecting blame failures rolling vaccine) news EU criminally late slowly trickling out. course lowest income parents cant afford take day send kids unless puking sometimes still puking wifes teacher saw everyday pandemic aint changed sure We're going see these. Anytime administer something 99.99999% safe, they'll still bad adverse reactions amount less 1 million, it'll end occupying 50% news coverage it. lab studies show zero loss efficacy UK strain. show substantial loss efficacy South Africa strain although vaccine relatively recently odds okay. Crap shoot not. strains know seems one particular mutation problematic. South Africa Brazil strain mutation. negative test completely meaningless. 

Countries managed COVID actually rely tests, countries mismanaged COVID seem bent pushing idea work. wonder is? plenty time another wave infections roll US large portion population vaccinated. US theoretically enough doses vaccinate 40% adults April 1, takes time distribute vaccines, inocculation (time receiving first dose achieving immunity second dose) takes month. 


Hopefully February/March/April pretty quiet, unimaginable we'll see another, bigger spike early spring. Especially given lot states beginning reopen, rather waiting depress case rates further.  Jews worried. 

Iran untouchable. Seems like firm Sanofi help produce 100 million doses Pfizer Covid-19 bottling makes sense anyway.  travelers returning from? can’t place south Canadians outspoken favor restricting travel it?

That would cringeworthy Yes people drop dead heart attack nowhere die within hours. Many people diagnosed heart disease known heart problems. 

It's also one thing vaccine ""that day"" another 1-2 hours prior. 

I idiot. someone gets vaccine feels sick right after, likely vaccine sudden random death. 

You full complete analysis. Dying heart attack also common someone gets older. often associated illness/comorbidities. man supposedly healthy prior this. 

This absolutely worth discussing new vaccine still learning about. Except ones literal brains sucked media scared human contact can, part will. I'm getting fucking tired ""what's really going on"" brigade. I'm openly calling conspiracy tribe face face, ignoring online. can/could anyone plan accurate response incomplete information? people taking serious internet lets still getting it. It’s simple put mask distance. wish was. It’s highly contagious unless stayed home vaccinations done risk. One day we’ll benefit hindsight 95% best people already reluctant get long swab nose. imagine less people getting tested method .... necessarily. antigen test targets spike protein may get false positive mRNA vaccination body produce protein. thing ""just"" best effort. best effort means, certain points contract flexible. Best effort worse contract style.

It's like agreed delivery schedule dates volumes contract. Best effort means, they've done everything reasonably possible, certain condition things around without breaching contract.

In fact, best effort usually gives client even power vendor sued breaching contract way expected delivery client suspects vendor enough fulfill contract. it’s safety, it’s control. seen AZ contract CureVac contract (the EU contract public) concrete schedule. understand EU would saying delayed agree schedule? made deal August see something much concrete CEO comments believe include shipping schedules. 

If didn't, I'm wrong, EU negotiate badly. did, AstraZeneca signed deal ship x vaccines Q1, can't that, well, company overestimated capability, saying EU trusted weird PR. Converting production lines difficult, company says 6 months okay, ridiculous claim EU believe whatever.  Neither vaccine efficacy strains(s) Yes agree. point fact manufacturing plant issue free thus AZ could known December agreed delivery timeline EU countries would delayed. contract stipulates delays need communicated immediatly not, one them, EU.  hope good day. March, wrote school system superintendent advocating closing schools. wrote back compliance CDC recommendations.

I promptly pulled kids school. Yep. biggest order Novavax, that's Q2+, hopefully get approved! agree. another point, illogical rules nothing reduce spread virus (such outdoor mask mandates) contributes lot pandemic fatigue reduces compliance precautions actually help. purer science experiment watching happens real life scenario. work school. outbreak. watched branch one student classes teachers taught classes. one case, cases exploded. county closed us. donated money teachers got sick COVID passed along family members died it. One teacher lost three family members two weeks. happened. None us COVID school opened. watched happen, amount reddit downvoting reddit karma going change reality. People gonna put again, lol. personally ok 3-ish months figured shit like testing, testing ramped city, started getting tested often going see friends.

The world governments / / CDC whomever fuck better realize need catch shit early contain next time. CDC better plenty boots ground China, Asia, Africa, etc. monitor strictly. opportunity time fumbled step way. People literally riot next time fumble bad again. Great way incentivize people get vaccine, tell pretty much never going back normal lol even vaccine.

/s obviously. Yes, AZ breach contract EU agreed ""best efforts"". Best efforts include breach pre-existing contracts much include breaking EU labor laws make deliveries. That's reasonable expectation. kind shit Wisconsin makes hope nationally Democrats start muscling Senate stack fuckin courts Republicans never see light day future. time Wisconsin. I’m disagreeing. explaining it’d unpopular. bad vaccine eradicate stupidity. due pfizer delay last week moderna delay week. AZ help send us vaccines signed. Let see week everything develops.

US close borders? realize way testing (and hence catching much higher portion cases) March, right?  best effort less concrete contract fixed commitments. 

That's factually incorrect.

Best efforts include stuff like breaking pre existing contracts much allow AZ break EU labor laws EU contracts also contain delivery volumes dates. dynamic certain range certain conditions. 

Yes, certain conditions like manufacturing capabilities, AZ plants EU meet. AstraZeneca already everything reasonable power, position all.

Completely unsubstantiated hyperbole. Please provide source AZ everything reasonable power, concrete would mean, AstraZeneca agreed breach contracts supply EU vaccines needed. 

Source? **Extremely** unlikely AZ signed agreement breach pre-existing contracts. That's move company would ever do. Oh, I’m oklahoma little sister attends dance studio teacher told attend competition even didn’t feel well...this country going hell hand basket. Yes, happened before, case vaccines. evidence nearly 100,000 people enrolled clinical trials two vaccines. evidence vaccine gave disease. fact, 20x ***fewer*** people vaccinated got COVID. That's whole point.

We carefully controlled clinical trials 100,000 people proof vaccines prevent COVID. evidence concerned? mean ""at least?"" suggesting there's something people need full vaccination waiting full immunity build up? sure will, Canadabro. 600M Doses Pfizer/Moderna + another 200M+ Novavax/J&amp;J = 450 MILLION people worth, include Oxford.

Instand explaining , go media play EU ordered late card . mean get 300 million € advance , least justified delayes. 
And since EU wants release contract ( cant without AZ approval) , either EU embarrassed AZ ruin reputation totally.

Because I'm sure covid still decent leg vaccine department. faster everyone gets infected, faster ends. got backwards. Getting vaccine better option, provided get hold one. bulletproof? Lol, shit trolling posts, right. 17 year old Texas perfectly healthy afraid covid start with. Add top vaccinated wearing mask, much safer want get? vaccine, rollout starts next week! 

Didn't say rollout late Feb supply issues? Two days ago, saying anyone wants get vaccine able get one spring. Now, CNN calling end summer ""bold timeline"". wish they'd give us realistic estimate stick it. reminding way much airlines tell delay ""another twenty minutes"" over. Sure.

We’re next phase, god knows point. district even plan place given go ahead, yet told local media. essentially know phase, it’s matter when. Honestly I’m talking US mess right (like every country). Vaccination HUGE operation. get planning 300 million there’s large population here. Also, take account anti-vaxxers ignorant folks still socializing gathering. Many Americans ignorant. going make things worse prolong things would like. Also masks social distancing still needed even vaccines. 0 trust AZ deliver 17 million doses. Pretty sure get cold California Florida. mean, wholesome award. think OP collected web pages, *some* links PDFs.

Yeah, disappointed too.

Could wrong: looked 25 links.  He's concerned variants think seen worst yet. basing prior peaks last year showing slight dip one even bigger surge followed. public perception considered lot cases continues drift time goes on. Everyone thought house fire peaks last year, would gladly return numbers. say that. Farting funny actually harmful. STILL approved AZ vaccine, makes argument doubly laughable!   cases going rapidly.

Not - cases going rapidly. Yesterday, 144k new cases. Two weeks prior Jan 12, 215k new cases. days outliers, whole trend going (though hard completely know curve real new cases given lags catchups New Years MLK day). Webmd legitimate website world gone mad. We’ll lucky 200M people actually want vaccine. 250M adults country. don’t need vaccinate get lives.  Redzone baby hope people really understand - worker power.

Strikes powerful. Use them. hope get go! Fucking brilliant. J&amp;J works would massive success. best vaccine. Hope works out. makes teacher's life valuable daycare worker's? kids essential employees go somewhere. nurse's kids cease exist they're risking lives rest us. AstraZeneca manufacturer. vaccine Oxford. really cares? affect virus trajectory pandemic. triggered? Every news outlet spin corona trends. align evidence beliefs skip. NBD. question. Today got blood test results back saying tested positive COVID anti-bodies. remember getting virus/if did, would've asymptomatic. I've already accepted one point virus.

My question is: I've taken lab test like 10 times, tested negative every time. possible test positive COVID anti-bodies current moment? Texas’ favorite grocery store H-E-B following exact protocol. 

Except aren’t keeping name secret, aren’t informing employees anyone tests positive ALL, unless within 6 feet mask several minutes. 

H-E-B stores completely infested COVID cases right now. COVID protocols written make sure enough staff keep stores running. They’re concerned keeping employees community safe.  ain't free, friend. We're paying taxes service. Fauci?!!!  I’m getting exactly one school district thousands US complying meaningful part stipulations.

It’s like saying “schools perfectly safe reopen long kids particle shielding like Star Trek.”

It’s true, also thing happen reality. inconvenience interstate travel worth it. I’m someone affected this. wanted scatter second half Mum’s ashes March, family live different state me. sports stars, celebrities politicians allowed travel also skip queue ahead stranded Australians money.

This part really pisses off. It’s bullshit. Oh let’s forget celebrities allowed quarantine home rather hotels like us plebs. “Tim Zook, 60-year-old X-ray technologist South Coast Global Medical Center Santa Ana, suffered adverse reaction within hours second shot administered, according newspaper.

He died days later, Saturday.

Zook's family said high blood pressure slightly overweight, proponent vaccine.”


In words, vaccine randomly kill healthy person. think agreed purchase 52M money got exchanged. signed agreements bunch producers. It’s good. Yeah I’m blaming you. I’m actually glad post seems like lot people sub want posts vaccine deaths never reported on. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s fucking ridiculous. People United Kingdom vaccinated good vaccine produced Europe, supported European money. 

Same biontech vaccine. Wtf going 

And top UK US export ban vaccines produced countries. Ridiculous. That's nearly adults, makes sense.. That's optional though right? Every country could done that, didn't. Granted, poorer countries really good option, richer ones could done better. would like thank summarizing relationship media - NYT go they're generally pretty point, COVID headlines little suspect honestly, blame airlines lobbyists even though that's unpopular opinion around here. would really hurt already crippled business many people would ordinarily travel say ""forget it, I'm getting test"" cancel plans. Whatsmore, still essential business travelers now, add another layer stress complexity uncertainty lives.

I mean widespread availability vaccines likely 3 months away so? now? Talk closing door horse already left barn... know? future? sounds like me. Lol exactly. Canada, spring we'll start vaccinating 80+ year old...

&amp;#x200B;

...that is, delays. I'm optimistic quite plausible  Well UK's vaccine developed university, business. Univiersities get lot public funding. even worse thing already happened H1N1. imagine much media latch sort fearmongering disease like COVID effects had. think western world kinda overestimating effect pandemic third world countries. yes, public health standpoint hit hard, people countries can’t *afford* treating like do

Quite sad honestly Beat it. way optimistic. elsewere profit

They sold cost price. Try often relatively suppliers market. Like nearly every chicken bought supermarkets around world comes four companies. even come two companies. 

Same goes raw materials special devices. 

But IMHO, together help get pandemic. also opposing export ban vaccines. really hope UK gets citizen vaccinated quickly. Ya can’t here. commend that, yet vague statement. still think say, return normal wealthier parts world happen year. increased attention helping less fortunate countries situation sorted, since thats case right now. child’s daycare shuts completely 7 days there’s positive case. far they’ve 2 cases since September. realize Iceland actually line scientists expect France Germany not? AstraZeneca actually significant production problems UK right now? pisses much whenever try talk parents whole thing affected mental health, social life, education, say “yeah pandemic affecting everybody”. They’re good people either oblivious completely dismissive feelings this. Oh shiit... Masks mandatory school, although hear conflicting reports enforced. beginning, sending home kids two symptoms, like fever runny nose. whole class too, unless original kid got negative covid test. Somewhere think around October, stopped sending whole class home. honestly, clue many kids actually covid school district less truthful. four teachers died, told two got covid school, hear two. 

The sad part, opinion, parents fought hardest person school think masks joke, kids around teachers. Meaning, careful households. Maybe thing nowhere ever stated *any* vaccines 100% effective. Even every single person got vaccine (that's gonna happen though) would still deaths it, nearly enough large concern. Plus, majority people get vaccine, it'll lot easier get actual care hospitals utterly overloaded. EU asking take vaccines away plants European plants lower yields

You mean like vaccines belgian plant sent UK? High school teacher here- anecdotal observation. state (SC) reports covid cases school.

Ugh I’m envisioning even back normal , news outlets going report every possible illness headline “the next pandemic absolutely heading all. We're trending down, up, vaccine rollout even gets along.

Stop spreading nonsense. Properly? still haven't. I've seen opposite: evidence vaccines effective mutations. Also, researching booster shots protect variants needed. long they're administered quickly, suspect tsunami doses coming, availability GREATLY expanded. great problem either way. Well UK need make demand since facilities...  IANAL I'm interested US case law regarding how/when make vaccines mandatory. Lots required entering public schools instance. see private college require public school can, I'm legal expert. absolutely heading all. We're trending down, up, vaccine rollout even gets along.

Stop spreading nonsense. Yeah lie people keep pushing.

Someone Pre-K tested positive campus shut 2 weeks. Everyone not-saying-it-out-loud annoyed family reporting kid's positive test.

Dad tested positive, whole family including kids got tested, kid positive, reported it.

After shutdown annoyance I'm positive families would either test kid report tested positive. 

So many people opinion ""I'll get tested symptoms, I'm ""exposed"" want life disrupted. Same. think there's huge difference areas (especially urban/near urban vs rural). PhD field ? Yes *but*, almost year since kids campus. struggling academically behaviorally parent devastating watch. Two kids might repeat grades *K 3rd grade) far behind, including tutors us flash cards, extra reading, writing, etc. bougie AF, ergo kids struggling every resource afforded, imagine much kids without resources doing. 

I understand repeating grade death. breaks heart see kids struggling many things schools could/should get kids back campus.

For example, live SoCal weather mild here. elementary classrooms *huge* sliding doors could opened order allow air circulate. cold, kids could wear jackets. know 3 major factors help prevent spread Covid:

1. Masks
2. Social distancing
3. Air circulation/filtering

All three things done elementary level district, schools would rather nothing something kids paying price. ton sequencing we're enough know true.

So fact getting promised good. know extract 7 doses per vial, getting 1 extra instead two per vial. 
Countries MONTHS prepare. Yes, supply need. sure thoughts.  
1) want supply case variants need boosters vaccinate them. I, personally, think Biden administration ordered additional 100M Pfizer Moderna yesterday. seems like would covered anyways 200M doses come Q3 anyways. insurance policy variants.  
2) AZ manufacturing issues. US supposed second country (after UK) get it. assume US doses made US able scale yet US based phase 3 trial needs information completed. sure get supply countries pure speculation.  
3) heard plans buy J&amp;J vaccine. guess wait see results know 1 2 dose.

There still inevitable outbreaks (due combination thousands returning travellers week human error). quickly controlled robust track trace system.

Without travel caps, there’s chance would capacity properly quarantine travellers track trace leaked cases. Many thousands would died.

I believe US.

They issues meeting delivery deadlines (measured doses), they're trying everything push numbers up, including ""6 doses per vial"" trick. Yes can. Pucker buttercup feel like gathering small number people everyone vaccinated much safer situation — much — vaccines,” Sax said. “The thing people want hear, though, is, ‘Is 100% safe?’ don’t proof yet.”

This concerns me. People asking 100% safe. reality eradicate COVID anytime soon, gathers never 100% safe beforehand.

I concerned people remain hermits incredibly long periods time waiting 100% safe. think nearing point public health experts need come tell people truth. COVID likely never disappear, that's totally fine. Less severe symptoms means less likely spread. well established many months. True, sadly, though happy hear could. :) 
Thank reply! someone anxiety covid, gotten lot worse since happened. I'm constantly afriad getting sick going affect long run. said Ebola going get much much worse needed 500 million vaccines immediately prevent catastrophe. EU responsible AZ able produce much initially said would. AZ even notify EU that. like 10% short doses maybe couple deliveries, 60% whole quarter. company know able produce whopping 50M doses? man woman spending time resources trying good others (and significant scale) vilified... appalling Probably lol  means safety guidelines work, think rational people already understood.

And Iowa resident governor, hear schools relatively safe far measures place, go, ""Haha cool schools magic let's open full capacity!"" daily cases US drop ~hundreds per day office workers staying home. economy can’t fully reopen without service workers depend incidental spending commuting office. course teacher infection rate up...schools open right now, period, many close contact scenarios impossible avoid get downvoted correct.

Hotels common, vacation rentals, many simply quarantine whatever family visit, expands points failure, speak, isolation. prepare worst hope best Yes, article makes comment that.

Also, UK hit transmissible variant virus, also start make difference parts Europe likely US. could argue NZ others kept epidemic minimum reaping benefits now, avoid variants alltogether, still, comparison effectively different kinds epidemics. course Oklahoma... never much spring bar exam dictate summer lol, yeah, back half year overloaded events vaccine that? Getting tired everyday, better soon. bummed going prime years life. sub sees government decisions (lockdowns resulting economic decline, vaccine approval) forces nature, beyond ability changed. ""Schools safe! Lets indoor sports! (Can sell beer indoor school sports?)""

Not much sarcasm either. Know people pulled kids sports others teams hiding symptoms, avoiding getting tested could jeopardize sports season. Still attending, still going events, trying get team parents agree get tested positives WOULD show up.

Also know couple said similar, pull kids went along knowing spreading virus practice, games, pizza parties. people become aggressive pandemic/lockdowns? forget OP sweet internet points.   American vaccine either definition Nursing home workers much lower concern nursing home residents, soon inoculated. 

Of course adults looking vaccine, nursing home workers less adults. organization disagrees, must right

That's interesting take.  upped 100 day estimate already 1M/day rolling average.

Nope, matter it? 0% chance UK going let vaccine county order fulfilled requirement getting paid advance cover R&amp;D costs. People different thresholds risk acceptance that's okay. CDC doses total far. Ask fuck second mask. all...according Fauci two masks new mask. know works. point would need guarantee access. Lol read news reports around sounds like blame game bad contracts mismanagement EU. exactly new them. repeatedly act self righteous. Sweden part EU Everything time think ive heard gets even ridiculous. Damn I’m jealous actually go NHL game can’t go governments.... can't control Pfizer doses go..... love Taylor Swift pun Like literally idea EU works. sign mental weakness.

I said mental health time low suffered from, real mental illness. tell me, I'm weak? say fully normal July- September sign mental weakness.

I said mental health time low suffered from, real mental illness. tell me, I'm weak? People Going Hug Another one those... ""Pfizer"" vaccine developed German company BioNTech funding German government. think US take doses get early. Right 2 issues: supply (getting 8.6M doses week) distribution (most states lots 'extra' supply). able vaccinate 2M day could use Oxford vaccine help get done quicker. think Oxford scale 2021 goes along would expect 10M doses per month beginning 30M later spring (again pure speculation). EU (not UK) scheduled get 17M February two EU plants. know many plants big US, US numbers based anything except thinking. Oh going get messy company illusion means understand happening,"" said. ""We knowledge production doses, produced — sent anywhere — is."" !&lt;

is fucking badass.

Go EU, PAID doses, allow sold elsewere profit. actually needed proper laugh tonight. Thanks! Thank you. also stated different comment incidents need researched further. guess happened... comments removed. safety dance?? Lord ad makes want throw things TV. Well vaccine perspective kids usually age 0-15 example one two vaccines US available 16+. CDC data broken 0-1, 1-4, 5-14 15-24. US total 121 fatalities age 0-14 around 0.03% total. wear mask think vaccines answer. IMO, spreading fear paranoia harm good. know people think shit never end given mask wearing socially distancing. worst part is, classes group rooms different buildings. stupid, like prison escape plan. Damn, level Mom aspire to. appreciate persistence. It’s crazy parents now. feel younger kids. get 2 yo wear mask? Don’t even get started fact vaccine yet tested kids 12?17? Reports lung/neurological ""long term"" damage generally taken context, often include individuals already serious conditions prior COVID. Instances amongst low-risk individuals exceedingly rare - sure exist, common means... EU vaccines. Vaccines developed EU funding EU and/or members. Vaccines vaccine ingredients produced EU pre-financing EU. EU also biggest market world terms buying power. international company afford violate agreements EU since would compromise marketing chances single market.

In 6 months time even need AZ there'll plenty better vaccines. average person 40 thinks 10% chance dying. Dunno median is... bet hell lot kids 17 convinced covid death parents value education. children need school even more, ever going chance all.

The vast majority best, probably whilst beating best good enough. 

Schools closed absolutely massive detriment standards education mental health children parents. might necessary, never flippant it. felt fatigued day half-ish doses, edit, could case. I'd bet they're likely super careful otherwise, esp know around small child. like they're bar hopping coming over. mom done vax, sure hell coming house. year without close children grandchildren (she lives alone) almost killing her. ""yeah... well... worry, i'll go home start voluntary 14 days quarantine... problem... bye!"" Yeah wtf??? AZ notified EU last Friday. can't follow conversation, I'm going hold hand explain it. 

You people think mastered art circular reasoning... really either bad faith arguing honestly understand two things quoted talking 2 different things. either case, using words explain help. I’d much rather go date Redford... putting there. people want anything made people happy permanently banned. small minority could live joyless existence? Fyi everyone many comments removed. 

All said sad man died investigated could due vaccine received right before. 

The censorship needs stop. disgusting. tolerated. People allowed ask questions express concern. I'm disturbed cannot express legitimate concern ask questions even express sadness someone died without called ""fear mongering"". Horrible. says main facilities oxford stratfordshire. Ohh, looking this, thank you! EU already lets companies export vaccines. Even Canada gets vaccines produced EU USA doesn’t want share. EU countries see supplies vaccines impacted, might ban exports thus, cut supply non-EU countries. Right? I'd bet they're likely super careful otherwise, esp know around small child. like they're bar hopping coming over. mom done vax, sure hell coming house. year without close children grandchildren (she lives alone) almost killing her. Well amazing thanks. seen articles. anybody yells wearing mask outside... ask fuck second mask. shut pretty quick. think sarcasm Indiana changed 3 feet apart. Unless can’t get 3 feet apart, whatever. virus disappears. thought insanity? EU geographically European local district made illegal capture part online teaching. Audio video screen shots. inevitable highly problematic much less covid  Biontech/Pfizer, Jansen&amp;Jansen/Johnson&amp;Johnson, Cambrige/AstraZeneca 

I think Moderna vaccine European Partner! I'm curious see social media usage decrease significantly every news source entertainer pumping non stop doom since March proved numerous occasions completely overexagerrate everything. No. AZ vaccine UK manufactured Oxford Biomedica, Cobra Biologics filled Wockhardt UK. manufactured Halix Netherlands. 

The EU supply comes Novasep R-pharm filled Catelent. 

The UK supply almost entirely manufactured UK. EU supply manufactured EU. UK consortium pulled together end March. EU significantly later.

The EU kidding think allowed export AZ vaccine UK.  indiana teacher, much sounds exactly like experience.  Neither important.
Equally important.

But lets get real- 15 year olds die covid bro. so, so, touch deprived. single live roommates, literally never even get hugged. Thank god really affectionate dog, probably helps some. literally fantasies dreams hugged someone rub back. think see friends family get hug probably cry. keep plastering data awesome. look people think chances dying covid break education.... average college educated person thinks chance dying covid. like 100x mark.

 They're already pretty deep... question is: really ready reopen schools? anything matter? Pretty strong evidence proposition ok... seasonality effect looks less r0 higher still definitely there... I'll post study bit showing this. contagious outright dissapear chose keep kids remote daughter’s school states strict rules school students. Ticktoc account secretly follow many kids’ friends videos tell completely different story. I’d say school naive kids’ behavior, many teachers walking around without masks background know blowing smoke ass. Me: ""2021 gonna much better""

2021: ""Aight, spread cheeks, might mutation there"" second shot technically booster feel like we're going see another surge bad got holidays. Restrictions not, people traveled gathered spread ridiculous levels. Even lot people know otherwise taking real precautions still got together out-of-town family.

I'm cautiously optimistic we're worst. things great right much worst shitty. AZ set hierarchy EU contract, clearly stating UK facilities secondary role production EU, absolutely AZ's fault. case, AZ's contract make distinction manufacturing sites, EU standing.

In case, know contract made public. seems takes i've read regarding whole AZ-EU situation politics anything else. Oh WELL DONE!!! FORCING anal swabs. Sheesh

'Who cares people die, long fill empty hole inside me?'

You need professional mental help Last week Netherlands taking Ham Cheese sandwiches British lorry drivers we've left EU they're legal import, want vaccines fuck current 7-day average deaths per capita Portugal (2.45/100k) worst country population 1 Million. UK second worst 1.87/100k, 75% Portugal's per capits death rate. currently higher every US state individually (highest Arizona 2.32/100k) much, much higher US large (1.02/100k).

However, US states exceeded Portugal's current death rate: 

- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts spent several days 2.45 early outbreak rocked NYC (these states share metropolitan megalopolis).
- North South Dakota Iowa spent days well 2.45 late fall/early winter. low population states vast majority people live one two large cities; they're also anti-masker territory mostly dodging inevitable bullet got hit.
- Alabama recently may exceed 2.45 still 2.24 rising trajectory. 
- Honorable mention Arizona current worst state far hit 2.41 also rising trajectory current rate 2.32/100k.

Also, countries worse well, countries higher death rates point pandemic:

- Belgium - 2.89/100k mid-April
- Slovenia - 2.48/100k early December
- Lithuania - recent peak insane 3.48/100k early January


All data comes John Hopkins data set via [this select chart format datapoints going top chart, hold shift click datapoint screen redraw chart show them. Looking NY's death rate per capita mid April sobering see rest chart shrink away redrawn show 6.8/100k peak mid-April; worst death rate large population world far (as far public figures go, knows secretive nations gone through). COVID-19 seasonal like influenza. Same! Can’t wait burn masks 😊 *during lockdowns. like isn’t true, failing reward increasingly vaccinated population degrees normalcy (particularly vaccinated individuals) 

They can't start carrot (additional normalcy vaccinated) stick (harder things vaccinated) anyone easily go get shot. Otherwise, fake vaccine passport order certain things likely cause people seek vaccine earlier would qualify (lying health conditions considered high-risk, example), making harder qualify get it.

I'd expect see separation vaccination/non-vaccination 3-4 months, way soon start without negative repercussions outweighing benefits. Depressing stuff. Like literal factory EU makes vaccine member states... Like EU run company Statistically, it’s gonna happen somebody point. You’ll bet it’s going get covered way reinfections months ago. think “we’re selling vaccine” explain ? Genuinely curious . mom CHF age 33 lived 27 years passed 60 . chance vaccine give CHF definitely want hear it. Additionally , CHF doesn’t kill immediately, I’m curious part too. Imagine back March. Instead society freaked hit panic button. look are... UK lockdown.... vaccinated. father brother put bodies line vaccine trial vaccinated months. mother nurse.

Shoo even claiming family vaccination slow see point, accept probably right. But... what?

Who teaches private schools? Politicians? Lawyers? Plumbers? private schools need hire back folks able job? would longer ""no-strike"" laws? would REAL collective power?

Genuine question. honestly understand. People live bubbles think work home live spouse zoom friends family, everyone that.

They don’t realize bad underlying sinister components come extended lockdowns.

Be hopeful stay course, that’s right now. People spreading fear paranoia think they’re virtuous they’re side coin anti maskers. economics (as used politics) upper class people get tax breaks (of much larger people get) pay hire people. Frugal middle class people order PS5, thus putting money pockets work home US Sony corporate workers, people lose jobs.

The government giving people money spend PS5 save jobs. 

Mail check/lower taxes semantics. money people spend get amount, almost spend consumption.

This factually incorrect. literally scales socioeconomic status. poorer are, less likely save. want money distributed spent consumption give people nothing. spent. EU would simply UK US doing. 

The bad news UK EU could block access Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, CureVac probably vaccines, too. first say ""Shutdowns prevent hospital overruns."" ""Old people vaccinated enough."" it? restrictions keep hospitals overrun supposed stay herd immunity? old people vaccinated absolutely enough prevent hospital overruns. moving goalposts. Every single governor implemented restrictions said flatten curve protect hospital capacity. mean don’t vaccine? AstraZeneca European company mean fair enough British plant serves needs UK first least initial batches brought continent. number 4 million dosages going around. probably part gone stockpile EU. right, people incomprehensibly dumb. really care laymen think adjust mirrors Hubble one give flying fuck politicians morons Facebook think masks.

We could saved *hundreds thousands* US actively punching dick again. like defend people made actively worse, suggest try educate yourself. Yeah im sure. ridiculously potent vaccine given fast rate. Fuck spreading bullshit lies point Sanofi Merck orders leave EC vaccine investments two focuses short term: Pfizer AZ. 

There Merck order. always far out. said Sanofi key, actually smaller Johnson &amp; Johnson example - could see results quite soon. said, nice answer, needed add little umph silly claims. Sanofi solid 5th option. Merck horizon option #9 thereabouts. Incorrect. original dosing allocations 60m March UK 100m March EU. UK order made believe 'guaranteed doses' EU 'best efforts'. seems EU check signed thoroughly enough.

I guess eventually find out. agree EU indeed sign order commit party ship, horrible mistake. delay clauses CureVac advance purchase agreement equate best efforts, even though acknowledge delays happen. fact, APA specifically says "" case delays anticipated availability Product, contractor aims allocate doses Product fairly across demand doses, contractor contractually commit towards present future customers, doses become available."", believe EU alleging AstraZeneca abiding Yes, much Germans realised EC made mistake went outside EC Vaccine Purchase Scheme bought doses.

That obviously received, production problems, [the order schedule shipped EC I'm sure meant agree disagree, I'm saying amount extra orders would led larger shipments time, production issues problem. Saying Germany put extra order, receive them, adds evidence argument. almost like building supply network production locations scratch months years tough task. seems EC appears believe production shortfalls apply customers.

Yeah, fundamental issue, Pfizer, EC making noise announced smaller deliveries EU keeping full shipments countries ordered later. I'd guess Pfizer AstraZeneca clauses similar CureVac say delays, contractor treats customers equally. CCP criminal organization. haven’t said anything 8% true- know it’s Taiwan since March 2020 Ikr feel like ones believe capitalism also ones feel entitled held accountable taking risks go along it... amount healthcare professionals I've seen dive head first conspiracy theories highly politicized bad medical advice really makes question quality care I'll receive ever need it. last four years shook faith people's ability behave ethically professionally. Haven’t authorised data isn’t sufficient point. afraid. prominent Yale dr. pushing Fox well past proven effective. accurately, pass costs people call ""self-insured"". US healthcare system large insurers negotiating formularies prices hospital systems advance. means many markets challenging hospital push costs private health insurer (where multiple hospital systems close proximity, insurance company threaten pull hospital network try raise prices).

That means place hospital cost recovery self-insured, sleazy way saying people insurance. people least ability pay generally pay cost over-runs like this. Assuming mean Medicago, plant baded virus-like particle vaccine, mRNA vaccine. don’t wear mask now. wear mine people grocery stores don’t wear naked faces place outside.  full maskless playgrounds beaches last summer (including me). imagine similar summer. 
As long withstand glare two totally go Target sans mask. 
Whether we’re required wear masks reality political decision. Medical professionals offer advice elected officials make decision. hospitalizations don’t show much risk increasing significantly gets hard justify emergency exists.  That’s next phase summer.  preferred epidemiologist gets TV says wear mask doesn’t make law. super legit scientist

As pointed out, really. point think China trolling rest world. Consider instead sensual elbow bump. Jared sold missing vaccines? /s Sure ordered 3 months later AZ said try aim (i.e. best effort) get 100m dosages Q1. point obviously must noticed wasnt going happen. Fair enough Biontech Moderna face similiar issues. However, AZ bothered inform EU last week. Pretty sure 60% shortfall deliveries discovered day though would equated several months worth production. One hell corporate communications disaster esp. sensitive issue. Nah, I’m good love guys names. reads like onion article. pisspoor tabloid rag Independent become days. sad watch. Wait equipped drones swabs, ouch! think big conspiracy. think governments caught pants know do.

They nothing lock crowd screeches.

They lockdown anti-mask anti-restriction crowd screeches.

Before winter lock people antilockdown.

The tide shifting point average people sick governments need readjust positions threatened.

There conspiracy politics.  I’m 42 good health got second Pfizer shot yesterday. don’t side effects. mean don’t strong immune system? interesting article essentially 'EU late sign poor contract EU company' suddenly become 'Blame UK'. Aren’t Covid positive kids less likely severe symptoms, hence less likely get test? seems like data suggesting Covid isn’t problem schools makes assumptions potentially undermine conclusion. They’re holding doses give people second shot complaining can't go dancing bar, nice try though. agree. really miss going concerts clubs, go masks distancing required. I'm going pay money uncomfortable couple hours. Also, supposed drink masks required? Yeah, going muscle literally nothing me. bad phlebotomist make needle vein uncomfortable district similar dashboard. Cases regularly excluded variety reasons. nothing vaccines.  plenty bars/restaurants operating Long Island defying Covid regulations. operating normal and, little, done. Actual enforcment, takes place owners start threatening Gov. Cuomo like Mack guy months ago. He's guy ran New York Sheriff. Oh case dismissed. remind call ""sportsball"" people.

They're people sarcastically shout ""oh score basket?!?"" football game knowing full well called touchdown. attempt feel morally superior liking something many people enjoy cope feeling left out/convince cool like something. 

They ultimately seek control people enjoy. exactly convince world governments many people won’t prepared deal changes something it? world dying can’t see anything meaningful happening ranting won’t solve anything.  Sorry, definitely meant snark. think quite ridiculous think one exposed. Kids sometimes going kids get other's personal space, mask right, otherwise spread germs. (That's we've kept kids virtual.) There’s still possibility could go abroad without restrictions countries vaccinated successfully. likely US UK summer. second doses start increase massively, unexpected amount first doses would start increasingly slowly. less, yes. entirely prevents issue, even make non profit entirely. Sadly, parent could argue shitting desk related disability, kid going anywhere. I've kids regularly beat shit others, masturbated class, etc... That's lot expected yet people doom gloom another whole year. data defeats narrative. Oh Thank God willing help. thought issues necessarily enough advanced skills. I, one, **really** appreciate willing work project downloadable *and accessible* us.  realm possibility. mean state owned pharmaceutical companies. used exist neoliberalism took hold. course, national level. would made hell difference situation. Chinese russian vaccines example, fall category say want worry countries I'm vaccinated really need hug :(  Man, drive-through testing going *wild* interested anecdotal BS. It’s worthwhile productive. one day sooner think masks longer mandated. one wants be. ""Can't go back normal infections low""

""Ok gotta wait vaccine now""

""Nope vaccine end it. keep measures vaccine""

And wonder people following recommendations. think point limit many people one room teacher. going similar gyrations area. Talking half students going every day cut class size half, phase certain grades. Like high school start grades 9 12 add 10 11 later.

This similar restrictions businesses like limiting 10 people small store 10 people gym. Kind sucks trying follow guidelines. OP, going send award massive work done here!

Is chance you, anyone else collected individual PDF files per article? many people that? 120-130 million? Yes, course. really works. 

I would rather govt pays £18 95% effectiveness (which Israel confirmed practice), vs £2 70% (in clinical trial), question whether efficacy low 8% people 65. We'll vaccinated pretty much every adult wants vaccine long summer 2022. we'd seriously screwed vaccination programme serious questions need asked pretty normal teachers seating charts classroom, less normal get pulled contact tracing.  agree. point solution can't worse problem rapidly approaching tipping point. know notion comes right free illness. absurd selfish. one needs straws unless there’s medical/physical reason. need masks. need teach shitty people clean themselves. returning Governor GOP Senators also returning Governor GOP Senators also Yup. pull seating chart, ignore note says kids less 5' apart that's there's room for, decide nobody needs quarantine policy says everyone 6' apart. returning Governor GOP Senators also live part Texas lot money made daytrip weekend tourism. never really shut down. Lots places open last spring wildflower season summertime small town festivals. lots opened fall Christmas events. They're already planning going full spring year. message along ""City folk suburbanites come country spend day weekend relaxing fun away pandemic"". Mask wearing, physical distancing, building occupancy limitations always voluntary many rural counties. added isolation since we're major risk category. people want vaccinated starting get chance vaccinated, pandemic considered done wildflower season. weekend crowds insane. TBH, husband fully vaccinated I'm looking forward taking daytrips again. moved pandemic chance explore area aside see window road running necessary errands. drive couple counties first vaccines entire way back ""OMG, we're coming back here, coming back there"" second vaccine waiting period up. Well, spreads sense communicable disease, spreads bodily fluids. link?

My local paper posted anti-vaxxer opinion piece infuriating. expected low number first doses today, great news. first dose 7-day average barely budged since first doses started administered 15th. wonder we'll see low numbers rest week supply bumped starting next week. yes, problem. problem doses ment us, AZ signed deal us millions euros, suddently, without warning vanished thin air.

We need know done act accordingly, unbelievable AstraZeneca, without warning, sudden cuts supply 1/4 agreed on.

Why say before, indeed really due production problems? US made sure weren’t allowed export though works low transmission relatively low levels immunity. optimal influenza covid though Yeah live like imagine others want either. rational sane politician wants create joyless world. I've deleted everything reddit now. use reddit stay up-to-date daily covid/reopening news. things back normal, reddit goes too. toxic annoyingly addictive. CDC's forecast shows steady drop. New strains slow down, stop CDC's forecasting agrees this. graph right shows happens start Rt \~0.9 start vaccinate people. new strain slows progress bit makes take longer get \~0, bad overall. feel this. trying compassionate toward best self, I'm trying survive. Stop calling south African strain, can't call original China virus! know this?  thought hadn’t established yet vaccines prevent transmission Stop calling south African strain, can't call original China virus! know this? ""Foot firmly doom pedal"" makes think CNN, NYT. worker died receiving second vaccine shot Maybe AZ stop promising everyone loads vaccines then. said EU time purchasing agreement “sorry three months behind countries, wont able guarantee doses Q1.” Instead went “oh 80million, sure Q1” seems didnt means Stop calling south African strain, can't call original China virus! Stay here, know stuff really difficult. 

*If elderly inoculated, spread* Yep nz need lock vaccinated. Incubation 3 weeks strain Almost 1000 net upvotes right absolute crap article. almost every week day since Biden took relief! glad get news via Twitter temper tantrums. vaccine exempt per CDC, current knowledge vaccine still catch spread disease unknowingly display severe symptoms. reason go visit people getting vaccine it.

Once community spread reduced we've enabled herd immunity vaccine, would able eliminate requirement. I'm high-risk disability single public place, except medical appointments, since last March. care aides wear N95 masks home can't come work around anyone tested positive. paranoid careful get. might imagine, past year sucked mental health tanked. I'm hopeful.

I got first Moderna dose last Saturday. parents vaccinated, first thing HUG THEM. Seriously, miss much. Hopefully late March we'll doses -- seniors FL rollout disaster still gotten access.

And plan living life pretty fully. I'll start shopping going places again, still wear mask. Restaurants one thing I'll still hesitant I'd take mask. feel like even variants high-risk am, 95% effective vax + N95 mask public enough keep safe. point I'm likely get hit proverbial bus. Time live again! mean ain’t true. EU signed contracts late, production problems basically expected manufacturing scale.

AZ aren’t making profit ffs EU trying pass blame hide commissions inadequacy. Exactly!

I laughed much Americans complained monitoring exports. still advocate openness cooperation, but... right messing us! Yes no. meme, grains truth certain ways. actual healthcare system example. unless vaccines proven prevent infection and, importantly, transmission expect less anyone that's paying attention push back vaccine passports rightfully so. wish otherwise there's easy way time around, I'm afraid. Bingo Yeah, nice €2 right? FEEL THIS!

I've always anxiety/depression kicked overdrive. lot schools fail implement necessary safety measures even *do* support needed so, either bureaucratic incompetence or, many regions, ideological resistance. members Georgia school board refused even wear masks moment silence honor educator died virus. may *possible* open schools safely, many schools still extremely *unlikely*. teachers pay price it. people 70 years old multiple pre-existing conditions considered high risk Covid poor physical health general due age factors control? worry well?  It’s requesting vaccines produced U.K. also. Archive link coming it’s slow today One one thought back December would much problem secondly vaccines even know would get vaccines think eat handful pretzels dinner hungry hour later? can’t believe you’re downvoted.. Also, pretty much neglects elderly people take risks they, too, start losing minds seclusion. 

Everyone went great length protect grandma except recently take anymore went painting party. contracted covid sick couple weeks recovering. 

Is really anyone else's fault? one allowed things order prevent attending? Seems little ass backwards. tried, human, too, craved meaningful socialization*. 

*Zoom apply.  Personally, believe personal HEPA filter placed around head. like extra cost can't afford it? Well say can't put value saving life. Notice said teachers vaccinated? Glad know teachers. live near plenty one scared going back one teachers high schoolers bc knows won’t obey rules. Again, none matters teachers vaccinated. I'm seeing like [30% I'd imagine substantially lower among people actually distributing vaccines themselves. income cut half pandemic.
I lost half hours work find new ways make money.
But instead whining MIGHT happen make today better family.

My advice make work stop whining. talking teachers, that's singled out. think anyone putting lives risk, *especially* grocery store workers making minimum wage. Unless work healthcare field, need this... even feel badly them. Thanks response - looking forward finally get see Portugal summer 2021 2022 Thanks response - looking forward finally get see Portugal summer 2021 2022 google sheet CDC data I'm worried about. parents, Dad especially, high risk. Type 2 Diabetes Parkinson's, 70 years. told doctors extemely high risk, people conditions arent well Covid. parents self isolating sake, asking for. Maybe judge people without knowing situation next time. WOW, almost locking people homes fear fucking year straight negative consequence.

Strange. Keep mind US also ordered 300 million even using freed huge surplus countries. Seems like Astrazeneca WAY promised. Clearly memory failed you. anti-trust cases IE, Windows. Windows monopoly there's not, ever been, anything that's really competitive it. People never embraced Linux desktop last decade Apple made in-roads market that's success mobile devices. dumb say Gates evil. still wrong. majority people wearing masks stores consider ""giving shit pandemic"" problem EU way timid throw weight around. needs change. Lol...am suppose feel sorry districts....who barely even paying teachers livable wage? problem Fauci could media parses crap says.... reminds security experts lawyers. vocalize problems *might* happen forget mention kind “yeah won’t happen don’t worry it” Solid read thanks link think so.

My second shot really started bothering next morning. hope man... hate staying home damn day, sitting front computer screen go ""School"". I'm freshman really feel seniors... NSCSD. personally feel district responsible. kids complained don’t feel safe begged hybrid learning. I’m teacher I’ve exposed numerous Covid cases never quarantined less 15 minutes. (Never knew viruses waited exactly 15 minutes infect another host.) 3month old home we’re waiting Covid test he’s sick doctor wants make sure he’s positive. Yet boss still wanted come today. Uh. Nope. I’m taking care sick child. seems like think he’s positive test says so. Edit add: whole system messed up! Also never hear phrase “wear mask” mid-2021, happy. never happen results would mean schools need closed. ones gonna sign that. Thats sad reality. I'm pretty sure CEO secret account nice tax island million £ right now. Cancelling steering committee, wtf Yup, one ever said publish health officials, smart people tough job highly appreciate, we’re ever great messaging lol.

Which going forward something work on. “flip switch” 100% govs lift restrictions reality ever cared deaths hospitalization go really poorly.

Have start moving goalposts slowly need see title know BS yellow journalism worst kind. journalist think get away worthless comparison? falls one side political divide, err side exaggerating disease okay. it’s virtuous signal favour strongest possible response. 

Another politically correct narrative reiterate (often without evidence) black Bretons suffer brunt virus systemic racism built British society. I’m almost surprised title wasn’t “Over one thousand times black Britons died COVID died Plague.” Uh original argument still remains obviously false say curfew anything, France still quite OK compared neighbors. pretty stable situation last month so, looks like curfew clearly sufficient, also getting unpopular lot people feel like prisoners, allowed outside except business hours, work anyway. know, keep animals horrible conditions wet markets. sure you’re downvoted. It’s common knowledge rural counties voted impeached orange dumb shows they’re idiots easily brainwashed conmen. That's weird. get paywall click reddit link google title there's paywall. still consider getting vaccine. Catching COVID estimated protect 83% getting again, whereas vaccine 94%+ effective. vaccine may also provide broader net protection different strains running around days.

EDIT: Source 83% number: comparable number deaths around 18,150,000 dead England alone covid compare death great plague? plague killed like 33% population back think. could wrong though. Florida cvs walgreens every corner even cross street other. God I’ll college then. Please want live again. Then, rabidly downvote anyone suggests reasonable measures questions measures. really pathetic. expect roses sunshine. impacts economy mental effects continue while. know I've become nothing cynical can't trust anything hate Capitalism vengeance now.

But hoping holiday wave nearing end. There's nothing really else months that's sort holiday gathering. Californian here.

Ya know pisses us off? restrictions. minor way understand (mostly) common good want part.

What pisses us SHEER HYPOCRISY particularly Newsom Pelosi. Newsom's wineries remained open business, still goes swanky dinners outdoors, goes TV says ""please thanksgiving eat outside individually packaged portions six feet apart."" Pelosi gets caught getting hair done, even wearing mask, LITERALLY NEXT DAY goes ""haha okay salons safe jk!""

There petition California hold emergency recall election Newsom currently 80% required signatures make ballot March. Newsom opening terrified -- steadily gaining traction. Californian reading this, please consider signing it.

We want safe want follow science. numbers say salons dangerous restaurants dangerous schools dangerous, let's adjust it! turn numbers say they're not, let people businesses back best show us areas need better. whatever waggle finger us go ignoring rules. Post photos eating Thanksgiving dinner outside park, Newsom. Let gray roots show Pelosi, 80 we've known whole time natural sneaking, come on.

Just love God, play smart go us instead playing little-dictator.

End rant. raw data want dig it. Imagine watching commercials hours 11 minutes actual play time. Elon...is you?

Edit: like maybe wanna wank reach alert tells wait it’s updating right now. annoying took way longer go 0 10 million took go 10 20 million. Soon lot people getting second shots. I’d say he’s optimistic talking globally! Sure well countries good end summer poor countries won’t fully vaccinated quite time. still breakouts worldwide. also lot vaccine skeptics well. 'price' excess deaths? realise approvingly posting article decision made politicians Iceland and, breath, castigating decisions French, German (and matter, other) politicians? 🍿 Christian them. Man completely commented wrong post. Thought commenting post person died. thanks, priorities life singular focus getting sick ever. country made clear give fuck teachers dieing.  deserve upcoming massive teacher shortage. That’s great point! Oh, doubt. mentioned *should* want get vaccinated, favor limiting liberties refuse. point nursing home workers special workers patients inoculated, happening soon. present important. Whether like not, discredit anything say begin lengthy post abhorrent grammar bastardization basic English. better. except fugly ones.... honestly, many ppl thought looked awkward look half-bad masked.  Work hard without risking injury.

One things keeping sane regulating stress sleep. I’m confused pulled time frame from. Moderna Pfizer developing boosters speak Israel clearly knows get it’s population vaccinated.

With Israel leading way % vaccinated, really kind litmus rest world. I’m really locked deal next months. Pretty much. offer something completely free people get greedy wasteful it. No, vaccine prevent transmission it? solution? really think things resume?  Maybe you. normal, average people getting lives within 6 months post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ultimately, think schools like lack transparency. way, can't held responsible. 

Govt officials say reopen schools, numbers good, parents go back work, economy better. 

The CDC look big picture say transmission, pretending numbers faulty. 

Classic pretending problem exist get want, economy opening ""normality"". Explain people medical debt insurance. EU already lives commitment. global vaccine production happening EU. 

If EU wanted, could blocked exports got enough vaccine doses every citizen. chose allow basically free access EU vaccine production sites unlike US UK, shared others.

The US hand example order little bit doses early started ordering bigger volumes vaccines end 2020. Since blocked access countries, Pfizer delivery another 200M doses US July. doses ordered. long deed helps people harms (let's say Gates ego) means, proceed. Sorry data conflicts gut feeling school teachers. Hope guy said ""If get corona, get corona"" last spring break goes back like ""Guess guys? got corona!"" God hope you’re right. also agree consider speed essence case.

wow reporting see🤷‍♀️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷 I’m teacher OK department head, taught district 25 years, cried meeting today said didn’t think she’d make another year. Mostly everyone meeting shared sentiment. It’s even health risk (already huge factor) — it’s also insane amount work doubled us. want us back five days week Spring Break. We’ll teaching in-person FULL classrooms, well working students remained distance learning. I’ve already told won’t returning. :(  literally get cancer sun. UK nearly back normal terms restrictions summer last year months cases took rise again. Oh boy... think mean say stuck outside Australia. Even Australians finding difficult/impossible get home due flight cancellations caps number arrivals per day. think good deed bad reason bad deed good reason. private companies chose service us uk first

Yeah exports could banned. current issue vaccine supply, expected increase coming weeks. Oh wow incorrect grammar least I’m completely uneducated viruses vaccines work.  Seriously. entire South. Simping beanie chance. Much America back normal already. Come summer, people still holed people holed started. also timely fashion? mean Europe also order enough vaccines get every citizen immunised multiple products. thing EU politicians worried get they've ordered.

And big question is, UK already raw materials needed production. could become big problem serious clash UK EU.

The EU pretty self-sufficient terms vaccine production everything needed vaccine production raw material fill-finish sites. Nearly 70% world's vaccine production capacities located EU.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, want multiple vaccines available. people might allergic certain vaccine. one vaccine work new mutation still do. Looks like EU blaming everyone else failings! [Second page letter, signatures four [First page letter, US amazing country size. compare EU. **This Merkel von der Leyen urged Federal Minister Health hand mandate EU**

A letter proves German Minister Health, Jens Spahn (40, CDU) counterparts France, Italy, Netherlands hand procurement life-saving vaccine President European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen (62). humbly apologize efforts obtain vaccine. letter exclusively available BILD.

BILD learned Chancellor Angela Merkel (66, CDU) von der Leyen considered important Letter Spahn colleagues sound humble possible.

The background Spahn colleagues jointly tried procure sufficient amount vaccine Europeans. Merkel, however, wanted make procurement, big gesture, matter EU.

The result EU failed disastrously procure enough vaccine time Europeans.

The letter says: “Unfortunately, parallel approach Alliance caused concerns. Therefore believe utmost importance common single joint approach towards various pharmaceutical companies (…) also agree speed essence case. deem useful COM [Commission] takes lead process. course, willing continue support expertise.”

Almost apologetically, four Ministers Health write “have started negotiations funding agreement Astra Zeneca far.” Moreover: “We would much welcome COM take forward negotiations”.

BILD learned that, early June 2020, four ministers serious doubts EU’s ability procure sufficient amounts vaccine time. However, urged respective governments – i.e. Germany, Angela Merkel – hand process Ursula von der Leyen.

What striking: contrast present claim EU, chancellery, Spahn, letter point concerns negotiating good prices vaccine preventing “vaccine nationalism”. contrast present portrayal matter, considerations apparently played role handing EU.

All four ministers signed letter person. vaccine disaster took course … think commenting new significant updates, press conference every day seem provide much value. could started post ""I'm racist, but..."" let us know sort shitstorm start reading. Yes, article *new* booster specifically targeting South African variant. one said free, yet exist, development. Scum inbred Nazis. Exactly. positive news comes (via Israel, study showed extremely low household attack rate among asymptomatic carriers, etc), people sub adjust opinion all, continue say thing 5 months ago Trust I'm way. barely ever commented online pandemic started. Conversating others reddit basically like therapy point thing keeping sane. Like you, can't wait never again. I'm sure ""zero COVID"" realistic near-term prospect ""zero flu"" ""zero common cold"". Fun fact: Moderna working mRNA vaccine H7N9 time exactly scenario. may become first vaccine virus causes pandemic.  *Analysts said spat indicative rising tensions large lead Britain inoculation, given vaccines 10 percent people far, compared 2 percent European Union. Britain first country authorize fully tested coronavirus vaccine, government Prime Minister Boris Johnson trumpeted successes.*

*“I think elements within government, within pro-Brexit community, actually quite relishing this,” said Mr. Yates Chatham House. “In case, seeing perhaps bit retaliation European neighbors fed this.”*

Let’s honest, incompetence glacially slow movement EU, member countries vaccinated ~2% less people, compared almost 11% UK. Ironically, instance, Brexiters right - cutting bureaucratic middleman EU process make smoother operation. still locked EU, would left behind like rest European counterparts.

Also, let’s clear - UK ordered doses months advance. Perhaps EU leaders quick responsive weren’t, consequences. want get vaccine elderly relatives gotten first, high risk front line. rush get vaccine reason, even though would love get turn. Osterholm perfectly predicted entire trajectory virus since beginning lol Osterholm perfectly predicted entire trajectory virus since beginning lol Actually Britain passed purchased vaccines 3 months EU, thus allowing producers set produce vaccines. EU complaining factory performing 1/2 U.K. get Pfizer vaccines, Eu mad block shoot foot. Trust big thing companies. 

And U.K. see assault citizens. Remainers leavers side crazy even think of. Exactly! people afraid wrong bare hear anyone else’s opposing opinion! Masks still required lot places, regardless vaccination status.  Listen I'm fan UK government spouting shite. Take look committing equitable vaccines rest world. entire EU UK? 

Take look commitment COVAX try again.  Im angry all, really want talk nutrition, hit up.

If want fight semantics whatever, please move along.  That's conversations ""anti-vaxxers"" ""its important build trust vaccine"" bullshit. People take vaccine see others dying it, need worry all. Florida teachers calling sick forced chose either come use vacation days instead sick days. mom's (a teacher) collegue forced school come work high fever COVID symptoms waiting test results. Guess whose test results came back positive day later? case, reassuring sure! Actual N95 game town. professional respirator masks available variety vendors variety styles hit near exceed N95 standard. r/masks4all lead want. cost around buck each. Seriously deaths going drop. New cases decreasing rapidly now. 7 day average dropped third two weeks. get deaths lag, shouldnt seeing decrease deaths now?  though? severe mental illness? vaccine end symptoms? capitol storming nothing Covid restrictions. Let's pretend anything was. upside-down, backward-head-up-our-ass nation planet! know repeated 500x per day, proven mean significantly slow spread. huge gradient, scientists expect far site low attack rate. IDK, company work remote years. fine.   LOLZ France: Hon hon hon we're smart invented metric system.

USA still using imperial system: Bonjour little croissant. Almost certainly not. Says who? scientist doctor involved?

Also advice developed public health experts Johns Hopkins University Resolve Save Lives, initiative Vital Strategies Oh shit too!! start sub. Sometimes asking questions OK. 

For example ""Is theater fire?"" potentially deadly question could saying ""fire"" crowded theater causing people panic. 

Panic often deadly. 

Real journalists going ""ask questions"" life saving vaccines deadly pandemic. 

That could cause panic could get people killed. 

Real journalists going ask people really studied problem real answers based science facts share answers audience help prevent panicking.

It might sell much advertising, save lives. 

We know vaccines cause pain fever make feel bit sick. That's immune system work. 

In rare cases people risk autoimmune diseases cause severe allergic reactions. That's immune system working hard. 

RNA vaccines make safe. make others safe. make sick. cannot give COVID-19. i've seen many people know, even people smart usually think critically, blanket saying ""oh new variants work vaccine guess luck"" ""you business &lt;x new variants work vaccine"" etc incredibly frustrating. sometimes try set straight what's actually happening times energy. Hi! feel you. embarrassing different leadership. week ago! :) contract UK signed months one EU. earth expect EU contract, ambiguous language supersede one UK?

best efforts include stuff like breaking pre existing contracts much allow AZ break EU labor laws steal materials needed manufacturing. need release realistic timeline ways let guard receiving vaccine(s).  chart literally shows it’s outlier. 

Great work. conventional wisdom beyond me...did anyone actually look many vaccines getting?  I’m pretty sure point, regions don’t care pandemic. They'd also screwing Japan, China, Australia, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Chile, bunch Middle Eastern African Nations who've ordered doses Pfizer produced EU.

It's one thing EU insists Q1 allotments guaranteed (i.e. production issues EU get allotment prioritized countries Q1); that's fair enough. completely different thing block severely hinder exports means get doses allotted Q2 Q3 moved earlier cover delays signing purchase agreements. don’t tattoo forehead anyone gets COVID— know— don’t mull it, act! least US, I'd expect hospitals see sustained drop hospitalizations/deaths go back restrictions lifted, we'll see mask rules relaxed lifted entirely states place.

I could see summertime, see people routinely wearing masks healthcare nursing home settings (although personally, I'll probably keep mass transit cold/flu season... nowhere else, putting N95 mask stepping crowded subway car full coughing sniffling people makes sense me) TIL schools operate different reality science apply. Good know! Chart death rate vs population density. Google median ages countries near USA. American, personally feel comfortable criticising another country's COVID response 🤷 doubt closing supermarkets earlier actually good thing. people need food anyways reduced opening times supermarkets amount people buy stuff reduced time span. average supermarkets fuller. gets even worse consider certain amount people time work go grocery shopping. large part, scientific journalists garbo read article? talking people usually take preemptively expect sore arm aches shot. Welcome social media modern hysterical media style trying cover pandemic.

Unlike predecessors century ago, hysteric looking big headlines become must, instead conveying facts Bro fuck ppl gotta nasty lol felt completely vindicated beginning this. I’d get made fun didn’t wanna hang friends sick. ocd would bad times I’d bring utensils restaurants. I’d bring soap pocket didn’t trust shitty restaurant soap. It’s weird lol people can’t get vaccinated also can’t get vaccinated anything. Covid really deadly comparatively speaking circulation minimized chances sickness become small. that’s strong argument post vaccinated masked society.  - knew dangerous use power presidency push unproven drugs. Sure, drug might worked, it’s still dangerous idea way. Yea, summer good here. lot restriction families friends could hang without worrying much.  


Even second surge October/November performing worse average Europe. Christmas really fucked us. Even experts antecipating catastrophic situation. Quick reference:

- Black Death - started 1346, killed ~ 3rd people England 200 million people worldwide

- Great Plague - started 1665, mainly confined London, killed ~ 100k people

The Black Death far known probably first thing people think see word 'plague', that's one referenced article. People think do, realize there’s risk associated walking front doors. 

Or, walking doors... there’s considerable risk remaining sedentary. sure 1-year-old specifically know they're trying target younger kids. yeah, fact one country - trucks cars crossing borders day - fact air travel states probably 100X Australia - makes whole lot easier. 300M people living i'm sure would able claim 0 cases.  That's good.  never tested CDC site says since virus recovered could test positive. point reason needed prove Hawaiian government recovered would impossible. Considering big foot spottings literally hunters gillie suits, we're going see ton dead people sniped hunting rifles make sense require international travel domestic. Oh even young talking vaccinating? didn’t know that, good know. Hopefully soon US able ship vaccine north. “So put little hand mine...” still counting...you summed national character well. Israel fine month would guess. seriously used laugh much hand sanitizer people would use pre pandemic won’t go anywhere without it. Strange times. know, everywhere indoors retail establishments. You’re welcome. Biden president shit still nationwide emergency. Biden much. Generally places ignored advice CDC advice US done better compared followed t. Thank you! Three friends separately told doctors told h1n1 could cause false positive I’ve nervous! Good way see sense smell still present. really analyze closely, farting save time waiting Covid test. Aaaaaa! *Gets Malaria* People misunderstanding mean. Masks herd immunity reached. longer necessary. people wish continue free don’t think will. don’t OCD train prepare normal freaked seeing near non household members unmasked. that’s issue sort it; that’s anyone else adapt fix issue me.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

That's main reason difference difference people anything else. Shutting border helpful though sure. Safety kids reopening political right now. disheartening see CDC reporting one thing yet reality says like wise.

Our teachers safety ability control virus rests facts numbers obviously bent. Oh, I'm way flying that's I'm terrified two good friends lost parents plane crash kids. know I'm weird lol.

My globetrotting GF however going kill fly see family India next year assuredly either xanex fucking hammered make flight lol simply accept fact around 50% people willfully uninformed, prejudicial stooges, explanation happened necessary. PA's weekly avg covid cases lowest since November 15th. don’t know, friends mine tell doctors told h1n1 could cause false positive I’ve nervous wanted find answer! Same. Besides safe, wanted least consistency kids year signed virtual (was optional South Carolina). It’s crazy many parents sent kids back (that option to. understand many parents work couldn’t choose). know stay home mom sent kids back.... “We optimistic because, now, knowledge regarding vaccine (that is) effective them,” said Kisch, lawmaker Netanyahu’s Likud party.

If correct, means delay two four weeks Israel’s planned exit pandemic, said. not, Israel could facing delay six eight months.

Months? Excuse me, fuck? Remember said 80-120k handled correctly... that’s people don’t wear masks? Huh. problem looking journal articles you’re biasing sample, since *negative* results don’t get reported. unless it’s clinical trial - results matters journal positive results (aka something works). studies show either primates cells done either academic labs industry don’t get published. p&lt;.05 mean? means 1/20 chance result statistical fluke. 

Now let’s say 100 labs run study - think happens? 5 get positive results due experimental oddities stratified populations that’s see. doesn’t change fact 95 labs thing got result “it nothing”, yet can’t/ won’t publish. telling people non-stop. someone Asthma, lungs fucked get Corona. honestly hope stick around though, non intrusive implemented right great way keep symptomatic sick people away workplace According people know actually lived time, no. lockdowns name like rest US. People ignoring going out, usually without mask.

Hell, many pictures videos **specifically Florida, exact time period claim,** gigantic maskless Spring Break crowds about. Even chosen example proves point. AAAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHABABA Really? could've guessed comically beyond absurd. NEVER 0 risk, never be. Every single Thanksgiving, Christmas Holiday celebration life carried huge chance someone carrying flu, cold, virus. shift ""0 risk"" expectations absolutely riduclous They’re experts. They’re bunch boozers. work home? paying bills? I’m saying schools necessarily safe it’s unreasonable close without acknowledging severe social cost one covering Great point.  Still point food serve shit. Naa, dun gon used up. Haf make reckon. No. I’m sure you’ll kicked out, (rightfully) harassed patrons. 

Mask usage universal haven’t seen anyone without mask inside, save deranged people subway. dont think anyone cares anymore  state wasted bunch time doses getting list priority groups. opened elderly asap we'd much better spot. think death rates stay elevated month states decision :\ post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

""Your life saving vaccine currently used mind using save lives maybe approve it. k thanks""-EU

Do idea entitled ask country export vaccines producing currently save lives order EU stockpile said vaccine gets approved... even maybe approved need most.  people dying live long healthy lives. ""quality life"" us still living? mean anything you? selfish? right drink, dance go pubs. Treating like space aids part problem. reality people survive covid.

The average person 40 thinks chance dying covid infection. actual reality chances 0.0x% range.

When people estimate risk 1000x cannot rational grounded discussion anything. thought peers 10% chance covid death... I’d sound like you. actually knew greater chance dying lightning covid... discussion would little  teach them. parent. school daycare. Tulsa Health Dept. adding vaccine appointments. That's great sign things continue ramp vaccination shipments. tiny percentage people die measles. flu matter. risk low enough, learn manage risk. mean, there's lots different scenarios - one father group FB opening schools complaining teacher called said son disrupting virtual class could pls talk child. DAD threw temper tantrum job make kid behave. One mom, TELEVISED interview, complained virtual schooling messing tv show streaming. 60, 20 vaxed. Mom works hospital.

Reasons healthcare 75 vaxed yet. made deal; Eu gave money AZ adapt production chain. Last week AZ came new they’re able keep schedule due production shortfall. can't answer question. Pick life save, 15yr 85yr old? important? Tiktok terrible one. post video location besides house, you’ll get folks bashing staying home...with literally exact wording used, sarcastic. Gonna fun couple months here... PCR overkill. passengers going get sick unless enough virus contagious rapid tests accurate it'd better rapid PCR tests could manufacture scale right exist. see details www.hawaiicovid19.com/travel

They're pretty reasonable effective imo. U.K. ordered hardly moderna they’re arriving spring anyway it’s completely hysterical irrational think we’re going live like 5 years. isn’t living anyway, it’s playing dodgeball COVID people beyond tired demanding science government bring end narrative truthfull.

EU invested billions vaccine research production. companies (pfitzer astrazeneca) treating class b clients, exporting almost vaccines EU producing within borders.

They honoring contracts delivering promised them. europeans right control exports like dance drink high end clubs. suppose ashamed that?

you absolutely ashamed fact concerned going clubbing people dying, yes. fucking horrible sign poor character. selfish despicable thing write, yes. sign mental weakness.

The good news nobody cares give shit, people like charge. recommend moving FL soon possible, surrounded people match combination ignorance arrogance closely wish whole comparison clearer everyone.

Comparing mortality requires context. Comparing loss human life not.

1 person dying nowadays can't negotiated less tragic 1 person dying 100 years ago. That's devolve semantics start haggling negotiating value human life. That's incredibly dark path follow many people, especially politicians seem think appropriate. That's ended here.

It would probably mostly benefitial people started taking death toll seriously stopped arguing comparisons everyone would take seriously. top this, administration getting vaccinated teachers. Yep. Pfizer + moderna + company's getting approved coming weeks/month... good shit around. emotional time see dead mother/father/kid casket say final by. Yet folks take time complain mask? folks sad. acquaintance told story went Vietnam last year (2020) Chinese New Year. social distanced celebration one guest tummy ache called hospital. ambulance showed up, 3 paramedics full space suit type protective gear came bundled poor guest Ambulance. turned later bad indigestion, COVID. know Vietnam taking chances.

Note: medical system really scarce since country poor, get big outbreak urban area, ton people would definitely die. Can't fault careful. Still 35 dead 95M people? compares really well USA 437K dead 350M people. Sad say USA like, first world country worst response, goes show money could nothing save 437K dead. I’d definitely attribute symptoms drinking night before. Sometimes simplest explanation best one. Novasep first CDMO AZ contracted vaccine production. Way EU deal. They're past 2.5 weeks so, stopped scrolling first page search results.

My point seem ""have foot firmly doom pedal"" find positive articles 5 second search. mean, everybody thinks gonna die thing catch it. reality people working age extremely bad time covid. Im sure life stake call peoples doors get bolted shut almost perfect spot kill ton people. deadly without quite deadly (especially among working-age adults children) people take seriously really take effective measures stop spread. shouldn’t lots firms use interns work previously done employees. Last firm worked let go someone department. next thing know two interns job. Happens time. That’s OK. people anal. mean ""spread""... also haven’t even approved yet. Even there’s clause delivery based approval, EU go fuck think deserve stockpile doses rather let administered countries approval. 

From Reuters reported, clause makes delivery dependant approval. EU wants AZ reveal UK contract weasel way in. EU fucked trying hard cover up. far Europeans seem buying it. I’d like see EU/AZ contract released UK/AZ contract. suspect would total disaster EU. contract irrelevant EU contract PoV.

Again, ""best efforts"" would exclude breaking existing legal contracts. That's controversial statement least. first glance, aren’t headlines taken weeks months coverage? could wrong. usually find three doom gloom headlines like given day.

Again, don’t hate NY Times. definitely sensationalize headlines. like Globo Restaurant , friendly neighborhood diner owns 

The Darden family restaurants features recognizable successful brands full-service dining: Olive Garden®, LongHorn Steakhouse®, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen®, Yard House®, Capital Grille®, Seasons 52®, Bahama Breeze® Eddie V's®. complete failure. idiots citing cherry picked article UK spread false information schools US. Even carriers, teachers large fall age brackets don’t put high risk covid complications. Teachers genuinely high risk exception obviously dealt sensible way. China going stretch resources much possible. could simply get UK US order. ready May. Good chance happens. 160m doses really sad. hope miscommunications virus vaccine rectified. Hopefully going forward scientists politicians try agree messaging instead politicizing pandemic. I’m exactly one month away immunity that’s exactly plan living. vigilant followed rules extremely closely, far peers. Unless concrete evidence still spread virus super easily, seems incredibly unlikely, seeing friends family indoors. I’m eating restaurant. I’m flying visiting friends. I’m dating meeting new people. gladly wear mask follow exactly outlined I’m going continue living way another year. can’t mentally handle it. want attack position, try without making things say.

You even use quotation marks put words inside quotes never typed.

What surprise.... want bite part comment huh?

Well, start? statement 'calories calories out' says basically nothing, want start? Yeah did, clearly falls ""clickbait"" ""keep information quality high"". Plug http://rapidtests.org

We problem testing entire airport day long. Cost $1 per passenger. disagree, teacher. get together proper supervision (there NEVER enough supervision) becomes superspreader event. Kids STILL see outside school, go BF/GFs houses, live, NEVER see teens wearing masks. leave around chin. think added coming school would DISASTER. Schools currently open US also complete disaster. 

But like thought, though. really wish could back campus community. I’ve done every weds work months 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yeah, really strong gag reflex stuff like that. fits. Many fit people properly. America one biggest issues people wearing gaiters one two layer cloth masks. Novavax

The EU order yet aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarggghhhh Yet US death count lower Western Europe, per capita. bad. suspicion mutations South African one escaping weaker antibody titers, many 'inferred"" mild asymptomatic cases immune it. true. Nursing home workers ones spread infection among elderly. Ok 👌 Great news. Hope countries follow suit.

Especially Vietnam/Thailand got trip booked October :) assume live inder threat lockdown? 4 5 different cases community since Auckland lockdown none resulted lockdown case likely same. Also, anyone leave anytime. must thinking somewhere else. Given Covid staus NZ Passport currently powerful world. people generally don’t respond well manic, dismissive criticism deeply held beliefs. people generally don’t respond well manic, dismissive criticism deeply held beliefs.  gonna say...I swear remember reading Black Death killed HUGE chunk Europe. US spending $5 trillion dollars covid. Whether vaccine £2 £18 dose, neither there. one? Welsh one former Brexit secretary one? fuck Put enough can’t breathe toxic breath all. Problem solved!  Exactly, decided 2 people room 6 feet apart situation 28 people room long 6 feet apart.

Like yeah might “social distancing” paper can’t look eye tell we’re breathing fucking air hours  There's uk research can't find right showed 24% increase spread schools open.

Also, uk schools (per board...) weekly testing.

If schools could weekly testing confident whole lot teachers would feel okay school almost normal.


I believe testing full school would quickly show lot kids carrying virus around completely unaware, passing kids family also fine. continues person gets sick. kids get tested longer positive. 

Yaaaaaay. true since time began though. Somehow managed before.

Plus nurses, doctors, grocery store workers, cleaning people, name it... somehow manage. single teachers?

It’s silly based almost entirely completely ungrounded estimate deadliness covid. Public health done fuck-all educate people actually “at risk”. terrible one. post video ~~in location besides house~~, you’ll get folks bashing ~~for staying home~~...

FTFY Sorry, let specific - what's escape plan requirements? said vaccine exempt you? forever? Here's deal. brought curfew prevent people socializing work. However, want continue socializing pandemic care curfew. either sleepover parties visit speakeasy bars. 2020: 2 sneeze travel 27 feet 100 miles per hour micro particulate linger several minutes depending size droplets. cough travel 6 8 feet micro particulate linger several minutes depending size droplets. 

Yep 6 feet joke. one coughs walk gas droplets you’re infected. Nobody said ""worth getting teachers sick"" schools safe. point use risk mitigation strategies make in-person school safe possible, given 1) safety binary, 2) risks benefits (health/educational/economic) associated opening closing schools. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

(Genuinely asking. I'm paying Telegraph.) folks---the beginning COVID vaccine passport. know lot people sub push back article discuses COVID-19 vaccine passports January 27th already seeing first evidence going thing. 

Also, expands US I'm going Iceland summer! somewhat reassuring, thank you. No. I’m specifically saying people much afraid dying themselves. estimation chances covid death 1000x actually are... going make rational decisions.

I would love see average person thinks “at risk” means think chances death are. bet “at risk” kitchen sink chances 50% even 80%.

People widely inflated overestimate deadliness covid. anyone know often White House press briefings held now, next one is? heard started back today. No. I’m specifically saying people much afraid dying themselves. estimation chances covid death 1000x actually are... going make rational decisions.

I would love see average person thinks “at risk” means think chances death are. bet “at risk” kitchen sink chances 50% even 80%.

People widely inflated overestimate deadlhnesss covid. Makes sense, especially someone spread virus even vaccinated. EU completely cocked vaccine procurement throwing hissy fit.

Germany, Italy, Netherlands close signing agreement AZ back July, EU stepped said we'll handle this. sat arse 3 months countries signed contracts.

Of course first come first serve. else would work?

They've embarrassed trying play bully. AZ reasonable best efforts obligation deliver vaccines means obviously respect existing contracts countries."
