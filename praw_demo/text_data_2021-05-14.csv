Florian Krammer saying sequencing (of genome) difficult limited virus per sample antibodies let virus RNA attach human DNA replicate scale. equal mucus droplets sufficient infect others. example virus steel surface (let us say door knobs), someone tries genome sequencing post 24 hours, genome sequencing possible/ difficult. However, someone touches door handle nose, highly likely virus infect person. Moreover, statement based limited number patient samples took, masses. Vaccination began scale months back zero studies completed studying efficacy transmission post vaccination (1 progress mentioned earlier comment). 

I don‚Äôt believe want, it‚Äôs there‚Äôs research justifies claim. 

You think smart keep accusing ‚Äúlack scientific‚Äù acumen ‚ÄúI believe want‚Äù even though done mention facts. ‚Äúhell I‚Äôve disagreed outdoor masking ages now‚Äù gives hint biaseness looking statement authorities stop masking go end world defending trying accuse others similar ‚Äú Covid negators‚Äù ‚Äúunscientific‚Äù try raise valid point. Bro answering emails WEEKEND! Fairly strictly least big retail stores person you‚Äôre responding strict vaccine passport system exceptions immunocompromised clearly answer question. it‚Äôs politically unpopular seems won‚Äôt happen. 1. 100% happening next years. think self correcting phenomenon. loads unvaccinated folk fall sick see clusters actually getting severely affected Covid larger uptake amongst unvaccinated take us closer 90-95% uptake mark.
2. Multiple instances nursing home residents protected amongst outbreaks vaccination. Nothing done actual staff dont take vaccine.
3. suspect seeing rise hospitalizations amongst unvaccinated largest factor incentivizes  Studies showing vaccination greatly reduces transmission. CDC give recommendation without taking account type evidence seems aren‚Äôt saying ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù trying encourage people get vaccine. Cept 60% people arent fully vaxxed... makes 3 us... /sigh  think person replied claiming AZ purely altruistic reasons, fact effective cheap alternative would greatly lessen producers' potential profits vaccine, someone cynical view corporations, seem be, might expect try undermine alternative.

I, perhaps naively, think Pfizer trying undermine AZ vaccine. However, political dimension unfortunately affected sensible debate public health policy information side effects vaccines comes light. 100% mask wearing around here. people made enough money routinely shop (or even support community!). want consider employees feelings fears. perspectives circumstances always aware of. important team knows important us best interests core decisions around pandemic response.

It also important team knows whimsical decisions. Especially since year ago, CDC completely unreliable individual business owners make best decisions could. team wearing masks year, ok take couple extra days make transition smoother less stressful.

It nothing thinking know CDC public health. absolutely know CDC running business. frankly, track record consistent CDC's past year. two masks complete bullshit. Meltdown itself, response meltdown?

They hit 9.1 earthquake followed Tsunami. think reactor okay given circumstances. recently masks always come partnered reduced capacity limits/closures many things. think hard people separate them. Case rate matter. Hospitalization death rate key metric. vaccinated super low chance hospital death, deaths follow cases anymore. unvaccinated, yes, decide get vaccine. May ask ineligible okay sharing? vaccines safe immunocompromised individuals, doctor always reassure guide may better needed. applies vaccinated, not? point 'science says unmasked unvaccinated people risk' correct face value. statement true even 1% population unvaccinated. 1% still risk covid came contact. even vaccinated 99% populations, 1% would still risk. continue making 99% people wear masks 1%? 

That's real question, think mask every single person country vaccinated? 

If agree masking stop reaching 100%, question lift mask requirements? 90% vaccinated? 80? 70? threshold? 

A data based approach look trend, trend continues current trajectory, CDC probably correct decision. trend shifts back though, could argue messed lifted mask requirements soon. 

You saying wrong mean much. threshold removing mask requirements impact downward trend infections. CDC thinks reached threshold enough immunity country. personally think correct. Wow, pretty large escalation 25 cases recorded yesterday. Taiwan fucked. stumbled upon ultra-left, liberate animals spectrum lmao Covid cold immunity to. think Canada keep going current pace? pace ever slow vaccinate billion percent population? ""Infinite"" already defined term. commenter need provide definition universally accepted well understood word. look dictionary.com unclear meaning. Yeah grocery store chain unionised too.

It's virtually impossible get fired (I see people call sick every day even insulting manager still job).

That's it. employees get minimum wage, hazard pay covid like 4 months, get reviews get automatic minimum pay raise... ridiculous. husband non unionised chain working conditions incredibly better. fire people jobs.

The fun part parents worked union years actually believe lot potential. reason grocery store unions seem joke.  think misconception ""vaccine resistant strains/variants"" pop every day. Even flu vaccine new completely virulent strain comes vaccine protects severe symptoms deaths cases.

Read thread General strike. Stop showing get fucked. vaccines probably go India first. 

Taiwan still low enough number cases able trace break chain transmission. so. u know many tests u order confirm 180 cases?

HK routinely get 0.1% positive test rate. translate 1 positive per 1000 tests. bet far higher now. regular testings many occupation, today, set announe 3 cases. (we finish compulsory test 400k domestic workers, required second round testing starting days. first round domestic worker testings almost 400k workers, found 2 cases. fries think many times people would go vaccine card get multiple free burgers.  way buy burger get free fries SS still makes $$$

There way limit didn‚Äôt like first honestly I‚Äôve gotten used now. Lol don‚Äôt worry fake smiling anymore, wearing makeup looking tired whatever üòÜ sucked wear summer heat didn‚Äôt mind masks. totally get people don‚Äôt want wear anymore though. never reach 70%. I'm sure goal 70% adults 70% people, either way hitting 70%. Executive pay grossly misincentivized even though walking distance. like kind sci-fi show CDC run advanced alien species can't comprehend humans work Grow up. Wearing mask zero impact life. P1 shows immune escape natural immunity though vaccines still appear provide robust popular opinion agree you. need give little time. much more, safe soon, I‚Äôd like see another month vaccinations NYC? suburbs NY? Universal always follows everything Disney does, I'm surprised took lead time. Sshhhh, keep logic Waffle Fries good surface area direct contact greasy oil people forgotten getting sick normal yearly occurrence. 

Yeah hated it. sick 18 consecutive months beautiful. Three hours later. definitely think CEO affect revenue much corporations size like point out, compensation typically proportionate? Honestly couch playing games, try source data later, really think data shows average CEO overpaid, especially considering packages given failing CEO‚Äôs drags average equity/share price delta up.

HIPAA applies health care providers, everyone every business. reason forced supply vaccine records summer camps schools. choice?

No. preferred former solution CDC don‚Äôt give bad guidance incentivizes behavior doesn‚Äôt slow/stop spread. first dose mask protect fine. stay stores. point anyone wanted vaccine opportunity least get first shot. plenty open appointments. P1 Indian strain already Gross Genuine question: someone vaxxed mainly cares avoiding people trying confront me, would safer wearing one not? don‚Äôt really care wearing mask care someone starts giving shit Yes course! also understand. People vaccinated carrier still infect others even get sick variants. I, one, complete total faith honor system. think extend policy paying bill. Yep, exactly. stores gonna scan ids make show cards? honor system wont work...and sitting policing checking every customers card might hassle taking 2 seconds throw mask indoors.

This announcement came nowhere city officials government didnt know coming.

That said, enough trust people public yet. I'll trust others know vaccinated wear mask around combined reduction risk transmission.

Stop. Trusting. China. anything. stop   moved slowly. hard say two weeks second dose, protected longer need wear mask? no, 0.1% chance vaccine stop transmission results panic excessive caution CDC.  Btw implication wrong. Vaccination centers way vaccinations doctors offices, suspected. holiday probably little impact numbers all.

Pfizer working antiviral works well, hoping end year.

Given well vaccine, bet them. know certain heard immunity kicks in. guess work.

Heck, 'heard immunity' actually buzz phrase. virus going disappear anymore. Better vaccinate everyone can. Pfizer promising one hope end year. Let's forget German politician ""leaking"" efficacy 8% elderly Handelsblatt happily spreading without fact checking. systems place allow proof created, there's reason so. NY already has.

Maybe take rest world while, don‚Äôt see Covid needs continue thing, especially locally everywhere. strong correlation increased vaccination decreased infection rates. So, vaccinate group, less infection group has.

COVID natural swings, hard isolate factors. example, Ontario declaring victory lockdowns, provinces dropped times, rates, without them. lockdown cause recovery, would expect places locked better results.

Likewise, vaccinate certain people infection drops non-vaccinated rates don't, looks like vaccine causing drop. Statistically, bigger effect, smaller sample size required, likely fast true random chance.

These *very* good results, comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated. surge makes kind test easier, easier see change infection rate.

A surge means large number infected people, lets compare infected people vaccinated people. small group gets infected, 100% reduction make small difference. large group gets infected, even 5% reduction make big difference.

We different concept capitalism side!

Let‚Äôs figure different time - really tired!  people able get vaccinated medical reasons, like closest friend immunocompromised beating cancer. like saying ""we care people."" vaccinated folks start getting shit continuing wear masks, they'll lie say vaccinated. going strange lol. sub always circlejerk clusterfuck paranoia. point I'm making afford pay workers hazard pay regardless CEO makes. simply choose to. money going pockets.

Take shot means have. might give people wrong impression. lying people get problems later vaccinated care? Well probably keep wearing mask make wear one infitesimal chance might get infected even though vaccinated might, even infitesimal chance pass wearing mask. 

I anti-mask means would never object anyone wearing one reason severe lack common sense among population really vexes Lmao . Blue anon anti science ways Walmart said won‚Äôt ask shoppers they‚Äôve vaccinated. Workers, however, need tell company they‚Äôve vaccinated order go maskless.  pretty dope county went days without cases, getting 1-5 reported every days. think every state locked well Oregon, we'd seen much different course disease US. TX GA pee pool. context Oregon stayed shutdown month more, *very* active cases reopened end May 2020. Israel/UK shown effectiveness combining vaccine rollout lockdown/mitigation. We'll see method works guess.

But directly answer question, would say 1-5 daily cases/100k, *across country*. long areas high numbers, subpar vaccine uptake, exponential spread could creep quickly. 

Plus masks basically harmless restriction (unlike business shutdowns). masking shut thing hard get back 2019 levels concerts/indoor dining/schooling, etc. worth it. reason fully vaccinated people wear mask regardless many peers vaccinated think idea getting third doses put aside entirely global south got around getting first doses. Immunocompromised individuals safer approved SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor. first sign symptoms hopefully pop week hopefully protected severe outcomes.  Google also 10x worth Kroger. interesting.

They're going enforcing mask policy that's posted signs TELLING they're enforcing mask policy that's posted signs. result pretend require masks anymore. Publix - crazy conspiracy theorists stop denying science! 100%. believe getting darn vaccine feels less uncomfortable average American walking maskless past ‚Äúplease wear mask you‚Äôre vaccinated‚Äù sign. certainly would me. gonna cause spike. Yeah greatly incrseasing minuscule risk that‚Äôs already negligible. keep even safer getting car might kill accident. You‚Äôre understanding statistics you‚Äôre arguing about. You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs .00001% chance hurt someone I‚Äôm saying things daily basis .0001% chance hurting someone. they‚Äôre functionally 0% risk. Anyways there‚Äôs convincing you. science data says it‚Äôs safe. conservative body CDC says it‚Äôs safe. Man Reddit says it‚Äôs safe. Forgive trusting experts please. *You suck, McBain!* That‚Äôs natural immunity too. Like, there‚Äôs reason cases free fall‚Ä¶ Actually would great. could given context suggested specific approaches rolling back mandates like mentioned. Show data supports said.

It‚Äôs complete BS. continue masking distancing they‚Äôre fully vaccinated? usually like support Kroger since stores frequent union nope now. shame! Children don‚Äôt matter gonna reconsider. They‚Äôre unlikely even exhibit symptoms. They‚Äôre likely die using stairs. Please reconsider letting children around use stairs country ivermectin touted miracle cure. Need go work? Shopping? Take ivermectin fine. parks could go take community dose... places also highest death rates. mom big proponent ivermectin ""saw news"" well started taking suddenly partaking high risk situations (like going meet friends without mask, going heavily populated indoor places unnecessarily), asked ""okay works protects go back home infect grandpa... proven also protects infection"", say anything appeared understand saying. think problem ivermectin used excuse keep things open without regards every safety measure. anything truthful assessment drug helps great, status miracle cure probably harmful helpful think. unfortunate gave several days notice creating mandates, warning lifting them.

It hard communicate team, hear concerns, implement thoughtful policy fucking notice.

Without doubt, biggest challenge running business pandemic been: politicians. Vaccinations Pfizer/Moderna around 93-95% efficacy. 100%. still get virus getting vaccinated, usually won‚Äôt severe vs. unvaccinated.


Also dude it‚Äôs mask. literally anything even pandemic, mask on. Asking real questions, instant pot well o_O What‚Äôs hard opening let small percentage stay home get vaccinated?

Don‚Äôt indoor dine month more. Don‚Äôt shop malls one month. hard? 90% people cater 3%? (I made numbers up) That's good. might good local managers carrying giant umbrella protect staff falling poop. they're vaccinated, either. think misunderstand CDC does. Everything put directly cited scientific papers

True

It might helped lot Fauci came made first announcement clearly explaining followed data instead waiting Joe CDC already dropped bomb discussing today 

So people understood based science wild hail mary Also immune compromised vague. father immune compromised got vaccination. care team made sure got two dose long waits between.  argument simply hold water. stopped wearing seat belts. developed better restraint system vehicles, using analogy. new restraint system better seat belts every way, reduces risk harmed accident, also reduces risk accident begin with. That's seat belts longer necessary. That's great. also nothing question. I'm asking person better informed make public health recommendations CDC mask mandates place next couple years minimum. swear trying kill Grandma. get it. We're quite ""endemic"" level yet. hell lot better month two ago, understand people still cautious.

It's going take time, best thing show little empathy can't flip switch return normal overnight. someone feels comfortable wearing mask public now, there's nothing wrong that. Disney Universal Florida announced masks longer required *outdoors*. 

This interesting see received. don't. blood clot risk highest AZ 1 60,000 incidence. J&amp;J risk 3x lower I've seen far, though could higher data prevalent believe. two mRNA vaccines associated blood clots far, likely means higher incidence blood clots seeing Pfizer particular seen huge level use. 

That's say AZ vaccine ""bad"". still lifesaving vaccine. fine anywhere within 20 minutes Minneapolis Universal Orlando changed earlier I‚Äôm surprised Disney well! covid? Bc that‚Äôs now? keep restrictions either covid completely gone immune compromised people?

Bc hate tell waiting either gunna long long wait. question impact 12 15 year olds really start factor doses administered? take days week? It‚Äôll probably take month two indoor stuff guess. think it‚Äôs county point today Orange County eased mask guidelines since hit 50%. believe wanted 70% completely dropped final ones. somebody please think poor corporate investors stockholders?/s Twitter outrage masks vocal minority crazies. live Philadelphia, usually 95%+ mask adherence downtown. clear people listening CDC; way fewer people wear masks outside, including walking around small groups. couple weeks ago, people would walk masks put passed someone. people feel comfortable passing strangers sidewalk without masks. exception crowded streets, understand skittishness.

In summary, normal people respect CDC buying variants/surge/transmissibility lies people online using shame others strict masking. pandemic effectively over. We‚Äôve essentially rewarded bad behavior country. lesson don‚Äôt like something, throw temper tantrum ignore rule get want. reiterate: properly executing office CEO billion dollar company objectively incredible responsibility, regardless semantic want get it. comes summertime fun y'all! We‚Äôre talking US though Correct. EUAs granted licensed vaccine. criteria EUA ""no adequate, available approved alternatives.""  30% country full vaccinated. CDC king delayed action premature wrapping up. Dang, right‚ÄîDisney World announced they're removing outdoor mask mandate *tomorrow*. word indoor yet though. Let's hope require restrictions, said possible rule yet. need constant monitoring pretending like we've completely defeated couple weeks time. feel like that‚Äôs Reddit now, unfortunately Bc people jobs telling wear mask day various work environments heavy restriction. Bubblers closed, everything sprayed hospital grade disinfectant constantly, able get close lunch break etc. 

Immunocompromised people nothing new. making push keep people masks stores them? people risk various bacterial viral illness covid. 

Wearing mask isn‚Äôt big deal. neither wearing mask. many resources get vaccine trying hard get people get soon someone‚Äôs fault part getting vaccine. 

And yes exceptions tiny tiny amount people high risk can‚Äôt get vaccine. sorry them. sorry needy yet don‚Äôt give money charity. CDC credibility masks issue. Technically though‚Äîmask mandates started largely last spring, lasted year. *up point*. lot vaccinated people drop mask know safe so. think seat belt ever saved life I'm going stop wearing it, freedom hurts much kind bothers shoulder I'm dumb adjust shoulder height saw ü§£ wearing face masks beginning pandemic two months CDC recommend cloth masks. yea, CDC pretty shit. wonder people want work corps nearest Kroger actually still bunch lifers, seem like jobs. There‚Äôs another Kroger town, though, seems bit like you‚Äôre describing. 

The CEO mega-bonuses (bonii?) got stop. missing point. walk around unvaccinated without mask, still putting vaccinated people small risk infection, also greatly increasing risk people unable get vaccine. Again, masks meant protect others you, way around. think I‚Äôd fine calling incredible responsibility redefined responsibility ‚Äúcreating shareholder value ‚Äúto ‚Äúcreating profitable company friendly environment didn‚Äôt make employees miserable work affects roles spouses parents, deteriorates society.‚Äù Apparently 2 hours Lol, literally idea real world works. assume think CEOs jack shit, except attend meetings get paid millions. You‚Äôre either 12 complete moron No, following data beating virus effective vaccines. defeating anti-whatever people. CDC follow science recommend cloth masks beginning healthy people? CDC bad masks start this. No. I‚Äôm sorry didn‚Äôt express better. Kinda felt implied didn‚Äôt need expressed specifically. It‚Äôs horrible number. people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal going continue thinking entire time. people unless close family member actually dies continue think made right choice I‚Äôm saying. even next week. niece making appointment 14 year old vaccinated tomorrow. leave 11 year old get approved hopefully soon. Oh man. disagree. lived Nashville loved Kroger. live Publix territory it‚Äôs nice expensive. aren‚Äôt even nice.  Heck yeah! Betting rate indoor mask mandates gone Disney (and probably everywhere US) mid-June, maybe even Memorial Day. Yeah, 22.4M salary. get huge bonus cutting hazard pay. worded misleadingly maximum outrage. Yeah I'm working one right corporate wants hire one, say bunch extra hours, cut department's hours down. hey $100 employee cards every 4 months makes it, right? Kroger said masks still required, even CDC said vaccinated people need them! Sounds like wanted good PR bad PR going come anyway.

Scumbag CEO, garbage company. I'll go somewhere else. Yes bit misleading headline. compensation entire year 6% previous year. headline makes seem like randomly pocketed 22 mil. certainly lot even took 100% salary cut divided amongst Kroger employees getting $40 per employee entire year. saying employees deserve hazard pay, yearly salary certainly gonna cut it. suggest vulnerable populations get groceries go jobs going libertarian safety measures? 3 million immunocompromised people lot cancer organ transplant patients. yes due COVID despite fully vaccinated. supposed rights/protections protect ego terrible injustice wear mask grocery store. turn marginalized group hopefully get kind response thrown you. freaking out. detailed rational response. Give years. We'll ai running show far better human. Hey, jacuzzi installed, invited dip. BTW, wear wetsuit? crazy seeing people online freak CDC recommendations. vaccines work work? According way crazies talking must work. people legit talking like we're still back March 2020. Boston subreddit someone crying ""only 70% partially vaccinated"" like major accomplishment. really don‚Äôt get ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù ‚Äúmasks aren‚Äôt political‚Äù people completely done 180 within 2 days. it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing mask still spread it‚Äù (even though it‚Äôs difficult vaccinated people spread) ‚Äú don‚Äôt want people think I‚Äôm republican‚Äù 

It‚Äôs horrifying people convinced, even though many fully vaccinated, mask less people somehow serious threat them. 8 year old get vaccinated? constantly put single items bags themselves

YESSS hated much lived Kroger territory dunno seems weird me. Science says vaccinated, need masked public anymore.

I'm going like masked social distanced right thing do. red flags ? think take long time. last percent going incredibly slow. Yippie feel way J&amp;J shot, uses (if I‚Äôm mistaken) almost identical platform. Everything vaccine got misreported US. People got hung ‚Äúless effective‚Äù Moderna / Pfizer, people ignore fact tests weren‚Äôt even similar, received rigorous tests around world face many variants instead single one mRNA ones targeting. News outlets reported average protection two weeks, spread depending factors like health geographic reason, protection continues rise past two weeks tops something like 88% around four weeks demographics. 

I‚Äôve also noticed lot articles coming talk mRNA shots, within context study there‚Äôs really reason think adenovirus vector shots would behave differently. I‚Äôm usually conspiracy sort, honestly wonder owns shitload stock Moderna Pfizer dumping bunch money testing talking ones create illusion false distinction. We're gonna fucking idiot starts celebrating 10 feet finish line. made way vaccine rollout, people refusing get it?!?! unless localities would force to, otherwise would care? care start pandemic anyone confirms what's symptoms ? mom got tested blood doctor found low platlets count .Test done month taking first dose az .It routine blood checkup . Got link? checked site article find explains CDC gave recommendation.

Either way - need Trust Science Listen Experts. Experts communicable diseases are, course, CDC. go class gym stations spread out, masks required entering/leaving station go bathroom get weights. impression mask mandate lifted state people going care. that's also classes 8 people maximum (even COVID). 

About carrier, point people soon chance get vaccine. There's much vaccinated. can't justify feeling bad anymore. Always makes think video: Still matter within 6 feet vaccinated.

Also 97% lol I'm sorry what? Krogers unionized. corporate. husband co manager. Hoping soon store manager. Union makes job harder doesnt much good lower employees either. It‚Äôs COVID variant attacking them. It‚Äôs local fungus attacking them. Normally body capable handling weakened immune system, collapsed healthcare system steroids make harder fight fungal infection cropping up.

Add traditional medicine using cow dung cure everything bad time. went hair salon first time year get haircut last. Masked inside course least I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, stylist well. point.. Haircuts home. Venn Diagram close 100% overlap, yes. mean masking new normal, currently living high risk family member ineligible vaccine. Must kinda record breath holding, goodness. get this, vaccinated person, wear mask required business, otherwise don‚Äôt care 10 people around store masked I‚Äôm not. Guess fucking what? making 950,000 dollars year taking risks. risky work job might get fired millions dollars. know what's risky? Losing motherfucking 10 dollar hour job. 

These people get paid shitloads money somehow convinced people deserve it. working harder scientists actually make shit, workers actually shit. go parties rich people bunch drugs. pass millions back forth. Risky ass. could take care family YEARS one fuckers makes year. one wearing masks likes follow rules. terrible take. understand saying. really MO CDC choose arbitrary thresholds like though. job condense science simple statements people understand. science says vaccinated people need wear masks avoid spreading Covid.

Ah yeah that's good point too. case, fingers-crossed Germany! first dose mRNA vaccine 80%-90% effective two weeks. second dose provides slight increase immunity, it‚Äôs important longevity.

So friends first dose protected they‚Äôll ever be. whole ‚Äútwo doses plus two weeks‚Äù guidelines conservative. Bars open...I could already see friends...

Yeah, actually laugh loud little. widespread enough overwhelming community spread longer issue

Plenty states less 30% fully vaccinated Sorry hear. cause death? Good point. UK positivity rate 0.2% compared 10% Germany. However, UK includes plenty less reliable rapid antigen tests number, Germany mostly focused PCR testing. Could definitely case Germany increase mutant cases, doesn‚Äòt know due lack sequencing. However, Germany barely travel India, contrarily UK. really hard say, see exponential increase India mutant cases worrisome UK, don‚Äòt data see whether something similar happening Germany yet. Germany something similar. parts country enter store museum either fully vaccinated, negative Covid test older 24 hours. means, freedom people vaccinated yet, involves lot hassle. Needless say demand vaccination, especially among young people, increased. danger themselves. 

They danger everyone. Everybody able vaccinated, allowing virus spread mutate dangerous already lead worse variants places like Africa She‚Äôs Medicare. You‚Äôll responsibility actions one way another. 

Every dumb thing society cost society. really stupid question almost cases flu, mean flu is... gone?

of course replace state suggests vaccine providers submit data, require it.

Thanks sources. vaccines already shown effective Indian variant. functionally irrelevant news. far fetched think might virtually back 2019 July 4th.

You still left huge amount daily infections deal with. July 4th, US daily infections probably par July 4th 2020 (a year ago vaccinations yet started pandemic roaring). tried find information couldn‚Äôt find conclusive source, mind linking read that? Bahrain.

UAE also still control

Common link sinopharm despite vaccinating considerable segment population Makes sense Canada, really drowning Pfizer moderna.

However struck quote 
‚Äú‚ÄúThe rules always don‚Äôt ask people vaccinated vaccine direct benefit them,‚Äù

Many younger people know taking community benefit, protecting around them. holds childhood vaccinations. selfish mentality drives vaccine resistance shouldn‚Äôt encouraged. Obviously people given choice, wording unfortunate. hope going happen Netherlands. government modelled given quickly vaccinating delivered doses many delivered hit 85% adults least partially vaccinated 60% fully vaccinated middle/end week 26 (1-4 July). problem vaccination readiness amongst adults around 75 80%. think government hoping convince small part hesitant population add 5 10% coming 1.5 months, still make 85% goal, doubtful done 1.5 months. targeting hesitant population, non-western immigrants highly educated population.

But hoping 75 85% adults actually want vaccine smooth sailing take vaccine ease, unlike US, last group wants vaccinated showing showing slowly. course, disappointing lowered demand ""patched up"" allowing children vaccinated earlier, hope necessary. California mandate place awhile. Newsom announced yesterday OUTSIDE mask mandate would dropped June 15 hospitalizations deaths continue drop. Lifting indoor mask mandates would discussed line. don‚Äôt see masks disappearing late summer/early fall. posted them. towards employees. towards customers. superspreader event, people think would longer happen?  Vaccines 100% efficients. yes perfectly possible. Dude got vaccinated shadows. Let sink  Well, that's gonna happen contain pandemic early spread deaths year - get high spike deaths short time, negate previous good work. least light end tunnel, vaccination campaigns progress.

We saw opposite Sweden last winter. virus could ravage early pandemic, vulnerable already died numbers, thus, countries, winter far worse Sweden. example Germany Eastern European countries, got away unscathed early pandemic, got hit badly last winter. India right now.

In end, matter successful individual stages pandemic - counts final death toll. P sure OSHA fine businesses enforcing mandate Vaccine passports definite must want open borders sides. know vaccine works finally time, they've begun talk opening borders. Honestly planned ago.  honestly sounds completely deranged enjoy wearing masks unless they're Halloween costume something.  tldr: using Sinopharm  Europe's picking up.

The science explicitly disagrees views science longer matters. 8 Maybe like able hide ugly public!! Well try base opinions rigorous scientific data rather heard news. Spreading misinformation one vaccine better another data back wrong called out. 


When put head head Pfizer vaccine AZ vaccine work pretty much equally well AZ performing better areas. charts show hasty reopening, new variants struggling vaccine rollout allowed coronavirus stage comeback think CDC hasn‚Äôt read enough studies? Upper East Side 90% masked outdoors. keep wearing mask distance. Make best decisions yourself.  use balaclavas that, they're great That's gap we've using UK. also means twice many people decent amount protection. Yes no. Part problem done kids, though they're bigger picture. Society takes lots steps laws social norms keep kids safe, agree solely parent's responsibility. think there's national conversation there. we're seeing posts like one.

However, point this: 

I went first day age group could get vaccinated. got moderna, meant 4 week wait. 4 weeks later day, got second shot.

Now CDC repealed mask mandate I'm fully vaccinated. still go work, can't avoid people there. puts risk. 

There's plenty people get shot first day. STILL second shot. putting many risk weeks would fully covered? Yes, will, thanks idea...my point hospitals overrun. suspect vaxxed continue wearing masks small percentage - maybe 10%. 

I think transition social acceptance/ change behavior process. You‚Äôre weird. possibility immune escape. Numbers look pretty low new strain breakthrough cases higher. Vaccinated people still carry spread virus. 

The numbers UK hospital admissions 50% transmissable variant higher first wave.   irrelevant enough people vaccinated. maybe worth sticking fingers ears. people UK first dose protection US, enough keep safe. enough people still unprotected concern learn much transmissible is. Yes. N95s readily available low demand prices (aka low) This. 100%. agree vaccine essentially be-all end-all, timeline everyone wanted fully vaccinated done yet. got first Pfizer 20th fully vaccinated 24th. thought June 1 good time say ""we're done"".  There's also availability n95 atleast kn95 masks market now. needed want protected regardless whether others choose mask ease.

I'm one shot pfizer vaccine I'm going continue using kn95s 14 days second shot. kept safe entire year despite frequently flying Im confident itll keep safe regardless people choose masks. compare long-term consequences covid infection vs influenza infection. isn‚Äôt logical conclusion. New Jersey statistics showing urban black brown communities way behind vaccination others. Newark, Irvington, Paterson, etc., familiar NJ geography predominantly black brown. think lack access, education, trust government. Many can't afford take work, know free, can't bothered. numbers though lie official NJ dashboard. think individuals preferences while. people may wear masks allergies, pollution, protect flu. think certain time masks longer requirement. Polls show 40% Republicans planning get vaccinated.

This match we've seen COVID far, saying. We're getting repeated waves disease. Everywhere.

But, make good point masks. Food thought: 188 306 number using -backdated- flu data. That's really appropriate, we're talking time masking up. makes much hospitable environment respiratory diseases compared much hostile environment. That's going big skewing data.

While measures may seem overreaction many, compared another currently 0 covid country like Australia managed several super spreader leaks now, measures probably slow. 
When Avalon cluster happened Sydney localized lockdown (for district 200k people) heightened restriction greater Sydney announced 41 cases 
Testing numbers hovered around 10k day even there's 0 cases around (Taiwan think 3k tests something Thursday maybe Wednesday?) Temporary testing locations quickly rolled existing hours testing locations extended. day 5 (I'm counting day 1 17th Dec, though announced detected new cases 16th already) testing numbers 38k, \~40k day 6, 7 reaching testing numbers 60k day 8 9. state 8 million people. 
I plead, sake suppressing outbreak, please look experience Australia New Zealand, look development outbreaks states handled them. Learn mistakes made successes achieved. open borders, I'd like see shorter quarrantine process vaccinated vaccine passport program canadian side. There's point opening floodgates enough quarrantine act enforcement cover travellers; vaccine passports could significantly reduce number travellers need monitored compliance still ensuring low likelihood travel spread. bet right! April 19 day LAST states this. adults eligible that. 

Should fact bunch 24 year olds still technically fully vaccinated stop effort? wear masks. interest, vaccine? Can/has caused erectile dysfunctions men? Thats Im hearing. What‚Äôs said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm choosing wear mask socially distance judge heck people choose despite fully vaccinated medical experts deeming safe.‚Äù apply counties states still mask mandates. example county still mask mandate. also Trader Joe‚Äôs. People still wear masks there. now. I've getting flu shot every year since early 20s. know works, know varying effectiveness, I've always thought ""why earth would *not* get something reduces chance feeling like got hit bit train several days?"" 

I understand reasons *some* people get it, vast majority people simply say ""whatever I'll take chances,"" blows mind. problem vaccine efficacy, tranmissibility new variant. B.1.617.2 potentially 50% transmissible UK variant, 40% transmissible original. UK government modellers suggest R rate could go high 9 Indian variant mass circulation. find people vaccinated put hospital, given vaccines perfect, enough transmission, thousands fully vaccinated people also hospitalised. could big problem. Masks vaccinated people scientific purpose Continue mask public? since covid came around kinds delivery services door groceries, restaurant meals, Amazon course etc. Stay home comply state local law. CDC makes recommendations. 

Private companies restrictive want can‚Äôt less restrictive state law. actually good post-vaccine fertility data Pfizer Moderna trial volunteers. information need made widely available.

""TL;DR: Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups. one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 affect fertility.""

/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/comment/ggb3d65 flu right back restrictions lifted people start living lives again. Probably harsher season two unless people willing vaccinate normal. go away endemic. argument extremes go reduce people getting sick, wrong. think many people think extremes places go get record low seasonal flu season acceptable worthwhile tradeoff reduced sickness. Fiction become reality!!!! Higher odds attacked shark choose wrong thing permanently restrict life? 

There drunk drivers roads too, drivers would never lose driving privileges? California. Look San Francisco, 70% adults vaccinated, cases super low they're starting increase restaurant capacity 25 50% Fuck no

They're clinging right they're afraid want look like they're right thing, really think culture changed permanently sudden. Even early winter bet 90% everyone saying actually wear them. majority India roughly 15-20% deaths never get death certificate. 
This article reports 58,000 death certificates issued last year time period. 65,000 deaths. half excess mortality. Math tough. used 90% maybe, outdoors. I'd say doen 50% falling. reason I'd wear winter I'm biking want protection cold wind. someone wears glasses, time actually loved wearing mask. remember correctly, posted nobody going get vaccinated, every single person Michigan going get sick Covid, masks, social distancing, lockdowns banned. also said people following guidelines masks forcibly removed would coughed on. even said MDHHS shut Whitmer locked treason. serious said this. [Polling suggests otherwise.

The data shows similar fractions white black Americans wanting vaccine (69% vs 61%) *much larger* 87% vs 56% gap Democrats Republicans.

This also something consider look data administered vaccines see huge racial gap‚Äîthe issue access, hesitancy. Never worn outdoors even vaccine ok Getting vaccinated less two hours. We're home countries(US, Colombia), residency surprisingly got message yesterday go Saturday. even realize age group (30s). We're getting Moderna though.  stores like Trader Joe's dropping masks? apply NY states reviewed guidelines? Oregon Hola 58,000 death certificates issued last year time period, according article. 65,000 deaths. Check usernames, didn‚Äôt bring child death rates responding you. 

My goal comment (which, clarify, boobed - child twice likely die covid attacked necessarily killed shark) illustrate unlikely risk is. 

Following science means empathizing with, understanding incredibly unlikely causes death that.

So briefly I‚Äôm check statistics. fully vaccinated, get infected show symptoms, still spread it? clear: trial going well bad. purely vaccines picking speed. Well apparently many  mean, it‚Äôs true based statistics have. kids die flu died covid. 0-17 age cohort 287 deaths covid. Flu deaths 2019 group totaled Surveys meaningless actual vaccination rate also follow suit knowledge vaccination rates still flagging mayor that. Steadfast masks county buildings literally two days later pulled except hospitals jails/prisons. supposed keep using masks they're vaccinated yet?

Yes Murphy announce concurrently hit 70 percent adults vaccinated say restrictions end two weeks later barring metrics going wrong direction. current pace we‚Äôre looking 15-20k first doses day. We‚Äôre 4,539,000 get 4,700,000 shouldn‚Äôt take 2-3 weeks puts end mask mandates/distancing mid late June. I‚Äôm gonna entertain notions conspiracy theorist.  thought story talking citizens country allowed back in? mentions ‚Äúre-entry‚Äù. thought ‚Äúforeign‚Äù context meant state? Asked get vaccinated LeBron James says ‚Äì ""That's conversation family have. ‚Ä¶Keep private thing.""

That‚Äôs fair  ok personally scared nervous act taking personal action believe necessary protect family. okay try perpetuate falsehoods based fear influence policy actions others.

I love way worded JESUS WEPT

Now that's someone knows marry cousin!

You gave degree dog?

All three top 10 moments meant incentive folks get vaccines take masks

And data backs up. Check [New York Times collaboration project done social scientists UCLA Harvard interviewed 75,000 people last ten months. 

All Americans 13% likely take vaccine means relaxed mask social distancing guidelines. 

Republican Americans 18% likely take vaccine means relaxed mask social distancing guidelines. poorly done. got vaccinated first week could state, I'm even two weeks away second shot yet. grandkids vaccinated all, cases state steady 2k, CDC basically sets free-for-all. science decision political one. Krispy Kreme even make show card. Probably states. NJ ending capacity limits soon still requiring distancing masks. suspect sometime June probably around hit Murphy‚Äôs goal vaccinating 70 percent population they‚Äôll drop masking distancing requirements concurrently. know Maine Literally true biased sampling people want take around including myself. I'm moderate literally want covid want vaccine YET. Evidence needed he's wrong. [Recent] citation needed. removing mask rules vaccinated people yet first people wear mask anymore unvaccinated rarely wore masks begin helping anyone? going checking vaccine cards going trust people right thing know laughable. would problem wearing mask public places flu season keep number cases down.  reason ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt work did‚Äù never enough people consistently wearing masks appropriately high-risk situations. Yup 14 year old stepsister got vaccinate yesterday NJ. covid numbers flatline nothing going difficult argue approach. Living America dont really understand countrymen. could end month people wont part. vaccinated. going be. think point saying vaccinated okay suspect summer masks everyone Maybe wants team thoughtful meeting first something? I‚Äôm frankly shocked quickly things moving. would expected slow change period several weeks. Same. Parent high risk kid. excited summer. Since announcement, there‚Äôs BIG noticeable difference amount people wearing masks around here. hope CDC feels good they‚Äôve taken away us appeasing anti-maskers. know wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúintent‚Äù consequence they‚Äôve done. people don‚Äôt know give  Glad read restrictions dropping. many people telling state I‚Äôm moving to, PA, going mandatory masks like 2023 something insane. Mfw live America get choice it‚Äôs probably big deal. CDC saying vaccines probably don‚Äôt major effect it‚Äôs unlikely THC, alcohol, Advil major effect. go without day that‚Äôs probably best though. Like past year already? What's different now?

The difference right thing allowed get back normal life! goes entire purpose vaccination theory herd immunity. 

I would also strongly argue idea ‚Äúmost world‚Äù followed science responsibly. had, Brazil India wouldn‚Äôt current situations, US would never experienced November-January numbers did. Starbucks still indoor seating, baristas short interactions customers. ordering app picking store years (well covid), I'm store like minute, maybe two things little backed up. Even ordering store waiting rarely five minutes total.  pooping? ? That's good hear! Hopefully parents didn‚Äôt vaccinate kids learned vaccines communicable diseases get vaccinated now. 

It‚Äôs never late make better decisions. Rhinoceros Amen brother! exactly right. Additionally, there's fact [a large majority epidemiologists (of large amount work state health agencies) think guidelines also completely laughable think significant economic motive CDC's decision, treating purely scientific insane.

At end day, lot people want wear mask anymore, jump onto whatever need order that. constant brow-beating I'm seeing towards people skeptical quickly occurred something else.

It's almost like they're living country 40k people caught covid past 24 hours, along 700 deaths (I realize improvement last year, touting good job honestly ghastly). country around 20% population young get vaccine, thus risk literally every anti-masker anti-vaxxer going lie vaccinated.

As someone lives state neighboring New Jersey, hate giving complement, they're lot smarter state this. Idk it‚Äôs accurate look breakdown ethnicity groups Hispanic actually fairly close estimated percent Hispanic people NJ. African American probably lowest representation wise suspect it‚Äôs ease access hesitancy. Mine lasted early March til January, bummed testing guy told me, blown away still every time went get tested okay try perpetuate falsehoods based fear influence policy actions others.

Someone tell Washington. great news! need stop coddling science-denying anti-vaxxers. Forcing healthy danger others wear masks must stop. sends wrong messages *enabling* irrational behavior care others themselves. Instead face first #VaxxedAndProud.  long jab good. point personal choice get it, widely easily available. 

Of course also personal choice take risk that's entirely yours.  forgot pretty much every person refusing vaccine wears mask threatened kicked out, sometimes go store say ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù keep walking anyways without mask. make difference.  adjust 21st actually every month US border (I think borders 1st right next guidance July August?) next imminent guidance come week US. 

However, given playoff hockey, wouldn‚Äôt surprised come adjustment. think July hard sell even Canadians keep shut down. going surge struggles vaccinating right isn‚Äôt appetite reopen. Britain, significant portion trust government, highest take-up world. LOL seal cave leave dead? It‚Äôs indoors public transport required wear one (even one there) 

meanwhile places like Casemates Main Street absolutely packed barely anyone wearing masks distancing whatsoever 

So really see need continue masks inside point awesome Costco leading way. need stop coddling science-denying anti-vaxxers. Forcing vaccinated wear masks must stop. sends wrong messages *enabling* irrational behavior care others themselves. Instead face first #VaxxedAndProud.  Lol yeah guys cherrypicks two anomalous years says ‚Äústatistically‚Äù data THC vaccine effectiveness? I've heard THC immunosuppressant, I'm curious getting high within first days vaccinated adversely affect strong immune response build. Ouch. Yeah first one got young guy getting practice guess. second one smooth fast feel thing! Hmm interesting... long headache last? Mine day determined wasn‚Äôt blood clots assumed dehydrated, didn‚Äôt actually associate vaccine. Glad got checked too. Actually true. anti Chinese rhetoric started overwhelmingly one sided... they‚Äôre fighting back cuz nobody likes keep getting ‚Äúattacked‚Äù   I‚Äôm fully vaccinated tested negative 3 times (prior, arrival, day 8) day 9, got results back negative officer came remind still needed stay quarantine day 14.üôÑüôÑ I‚Äôm fully vaccinated present test border get negative arrival test feel symptoms, really don‚Äôt understand can‚Äôt go outside wearing mask. point, Day 8 test, really REALLY understand why. Damn, day saying would require masks everyone lol. anyone care needs go hospital full can't help you. 

Everything happened previously, elective surgeries cancelled etc., could happen again. 

Social distancing lower occupancy limits remain effect couple months. close, want let new variant hosts take. never happen. would say 65% probably best case scenario.  Same. play sports outdoors group us vaccinated fine going maskless, one guy vaccine-hesitant went around making us wear masks play. definitely covid-aware people still anxious vaccine. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Yeah, makes sense, seems like lot people taking signal put masks children overwhelmingly fully vaccinated yet.  Tragic seeing picture? CDC stupid every step process. refused believe airborne, despite studies. ignored data low outdoor transmission result parks trails closed.

Canada reported 28 cases VITT 2.5 million doses AstraZeneca. Source: quote: ‚Äú Ontario said believes VITT¬†incident rate¬†is roughly 1 60,000 shots administered‚Äù

That‚Äôs much different risk profile originally disclosed AstraZeneca, suspending use seems make sense given Pfizer Moderna essentially available Canadians next weeks. didn‚Äôt say cared. said considered it. anti-maskers anti-vaxxers care wearing masks anyway. decision impact them. That's keep missing. breaking rules before. wearing masks chins. pulling masks talk. everything could wear mask. many stores enforcing policy anyway store employees want conflict. 

So CDC decision change much anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers. group mingling infecting would continue without CDC decision. no, CDC decision going kill them. going kill regardless due lifestyle. 

But concerned keep masking distancing protect themselves. people extra incentive go get vaccinated soon possible. 

As result, think common sense wrong. common sense worrying population die due risky behavior nothing CDC decision. 

My common sense says decision save lives incentives getting hesitant get vaccine. also create trust CDC vaccines future pandemics. paints positive image people get vaccines, CDC reasonable relax masking. far reaching positive impact vaccines CDC future vaccines work lead relaxation strict requirements. positive far outweighs negative. 

Your common sense seems stuck protecting ""liars/anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers"" care infect regardless CDC says. 

But like keep saying, test common sense trend based data. See works you. even something joke surprising. New York always expected one last states lift mask mandade. Get j&amp;j then. Easy solution. Mega corporations shown time time care safety people. customers, employees, anyone. care about] profits. corporations would never chosen close (and many fact) law. they're interested regaining profits lost last year. People nothing walking atms . give credit fuck talking  subway sites open five hours day. that's good, really need sites open 24 hours day, especially places like New York City. many people work second/third/split shifts, multiple jobs, responsibility people, able fit neat 5-hour timeslot.

The 24-hour sites open permanently, well-advertized, well advance, people know arrange come sites running. regulations UK. vaccinated last week. confirm magnets work. making Tik Tok video. Actually Bill Maher proved theory wrong. He‚Äôs fully vaccinated still caught covid. Along CDC showing 9,000 people still contracted Covid fully vaccinated [reference Actually whole article talking uncertainty it‚Äôs even possible catch covid vaccine. bad read. think nuance depending ""public health campaign"" we're talking about, blanketly applying distrust anything related medicine.

Calling COVID vaccines ""public health campaign"" vein something like Tuskegee nonsensical. distribution/purpose/or detail, obviously way comparable.  No. care die.

Valar morghulis.

The sooner better. Me, too. know worse needle-phobia? terrible month spent suffering covid ongoing health issues I'm dealing with.  Maximize sex life next two years. yet fucking I'm still gonna wear piece cloth goddamn face kid well gets vaccine would make much less likely becoming 301. legit least do.  support decision individual venue. government able tell can‚Äôt privately without vaccine. Yes oppressed wear pants public Yeah, mean statement holds true sometimes, always.

I‚Äôm 15 getting shot today. lot friends want too, parents haven‚Äôt gotten won‚Äôt let either.

The main reason want wait bit longer testing, they‚Äôve pro-vaxx shots. They‚Äôre also left-leaning, it‚Äôs political thing. life me, understand sheer stupidity people deny science name political agenda. virus. part mother nature going thing regardless vote for. telling daughter yesterday sister young vaccinated there‚Äôs way I‚Äôd let go school. (They‚Äôre adults)

I absolutely feel terrible parents kids can‚Äôt vaccinated whether due age anything really. may one worst takes COVID I‚Äôve ever heard, maybe even worse outright denial existence.

Viruses don‚Äôt even metabolic process. label ‚Äúliving‚Äù much debate begin with.

Equating desire die virus arrogance human beings philosophical pandering. could told I'm Dr Yes, they're fine that. people keep saying like it‚Äôs gotcha moment??? CDC. mega global corporations. thought possibility. GUARANTEE YOU. agree- it‚Äôs really whether vaccinated people keep wearing masks (they shouldn‚Äôt to). live rural area majority doesn‚Äôt believe virus, wore masks indoors stores required it. they‚Äôre celebrating don‚Äôt anymore they‚Äôll lie vaxxed (per local community fb page), won‚Äôt feel like safely take kids anywhere able get vaccine. I‚Äôve lost faith people right thing last year. love Captain Obvious article like circulate people born goddamn country, tangible reason front eyes stop shoving heads sand going ‚ÄúNo, stuff can‚Äôt possibly happen here. aMerIcA!‚Äù

Like, yes. rest us already knew that. Moving on. Thank you. found good data aap well. 4 days (24 states NYC reported)*
Children 1.2%-3.1% total reported hospitalizations, 0.1%-1.9% child COVID-19 cases resulted hospitalization
Mortality (43 states, NYC, PR GU reported)*
Children 0.00%-0.21% COVID-19 deaths, 9 states reported zero child deaths
‚ÄãIn states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% child COVID-19 cases resulted agree time come, think we're yet. Nice California! üëçüëè think risk worth taking Starbucks places, hope that's true kicked butt couple days, know worse? got covid difficulty breathing way months afterwards. I'm young healthy dude too, still got vaccine long term affects covid fear covid continuing mutate. silly afraid vaccine covids possibly permanent damage lungs alternative. yet 90% people Bay Area still wearing masks, outside, completely distanced. still give dirty looks wearing one lol backass myopic view. Vaccines won‚Äôt help all? stake child dying. Forget 22%+ new cases kids thrive different alive, also transmit virus. would think new vulnerable, chicken shit take vaccine would concerned that. children may good recovery rate, contract may not. Yikes! worrying. Sure, efforts develop trial vaccines quickly crowning jewel Trump Administration. pity seems uninterested right talking vaccinations, even among supporters.

It noted, though, distribution manufacturing happening past months seems mostly due Biden Administration. IIRC, current team took over, shocked lack planning distribution come planning. Well gonna get wish summer. may may like results. agree point public understand complicated ideas making publicly known fuels conspiracy theorists. Figuring natural infection recovery,I‚Äôd say close, already honestly I'm still working, actually. this.

But I'm spoiled selfish person thinks themselves. New Normal would love though. Ah, gotcha. Definitely misunderstood meant here. truly hope that's case. Starbucks, cdc. mortality, also hospitalizations. risk extremely small

we can‚Äôt let society designed around irrational thinking Tuskegee experiment concluded FIFTY years ago. Furthermore, anybody see vaccine given everybody. Gimme break. Stop apologizing vaccine hesitant. 

Black people long litany legitimate complaints government none reasonable excuse vaccine hesitant. literally fear; massive rise cases leading another wave everyone let guard running around maskless.

 pretty vaccine initially decided perhaps getting covid way worse watching harm numerous patients seeing survivors lingering life-altering symptoms. got protect lungs kidneys hopefully help protect patients. still ok wearing mask, work, shopping, wherever pandemic go away overnight. it?

My hospital can't handle another covid wave; lost many nurses last time, current patient load still heavy. hospital already max capacity despite fewer cases... shockingly there, still floors dedicated covid gone away....imagine that. wanted microchipped. get unvaccinated? much choice. I'd much rather take about, health wellbeing important convenience me. like saying someone chose quit job dealing harassment unsafe working conditions point life endangered.

While technically one forces keep kid home, like options exactly equitable.   trying ""say worrisome things"". Trying understand discuss finer points vaccines work someone would would infectious. true staff infected inoculated J&amp;J vaccines. Maybe penis gets bigger Vaccinated people likely going continue wearing masks. Unvaccinated people going rip pretend they've vaccinated.

You're assuming people decent folk care others, we've learned past year half people selfish shitty care people nears much thought. unfortunate risk we're going take. I've heard, CDC taken account found risk low enough. No, thinking clearly did. I‚Äôm sorry loss. There‚Äôs nothing say make better you, wish you‚Äôd never experienced heartbreak. I‚Äôm trying prevent daughter suffering fate, science actually says masks protect better lack masks. 

The truth everyone get vaccinated yet, that‚Äôs exactly fear. doesn‚Äôt choice. She‚Äôs young. deserves get back normal life much everyone else. Lifting mask recommendations soon guarantees can‚Äôt. articles saying otherwise it‚Äôs true. Vaccinated people protected. Unvaccinated people not. yes, numbers dropping, still hundreds people dying covid country every day. Thousands fully vaccinated people still contracted covid, don‚Äôt know people contagious not. You‚Äôre right covid won‚Äôt fully go away, could get much better is. would get better faster people careful months. 

No one wants protections place forever. want long needed, they‚Äôre still needed. know, need them. family. statistic. people trying survive, CDC left us behind. I‚Äôm heartbroken children, I‚Äôm terrified future broken, unforgivably selfish world. 

I‚Äôm glad covid isn‚Äôt concern anymore, still lot people. also deserve survive. also deserve normal life. wish people cared that. one making claim. I‚Äôm asking basis. point response. scientific basis claim? need ""show respect""? 

I've taken precautions (mask, sanitizer, social distancing,minimal contact, etc). Got vaccinated first chance got. 

I've done part get wear mask, others want part. That's them. Get high horse lmao. issue children could easily adverse reactions dont present adults.

The could said virus. agree need test vaccine children approving general use, government really needs hurry process people going running around without masks everywhere. people insane. want believe ""bad people"" could unemployment, look like monsters cheer end.  Considering California‚Äôs history forced sterilization Latino population surprised Los Angels County high vaccinations. People good reason distrust government. practice wasn‚Äôt abolished 1979, still recent history, recent enough many people‚Äôs cultural memory.  also bragged getting vaccine done get credit 

The issue massively downplayed Covid caused all.

And Dems charge whilst vaccine rolled Republicans naturally precisely. caution fault wasting precious enforcement resources. Yeah true, thought norm try herd immunity. bad. mad? Hell yeah! single parents able watch kids immno-compromised people able keep safe!! Better pretend everyone unemployment lazy moocher!  Yes. will. think following along well husband‚Äôs supervisor one types. talking excited mask mandate lifted, replied: ‚ÄúYou know vaccinated people go maskless, right?‚Äù

Her response? ‚ÄúFuck shit. I‚Äôm getting vaccinated I‚Äôm wearing mask.‚Äù

Soooo glad husband father work insists spreading plague. I‚Äôm glad vaccinated. rate hospitalization children 18 8 100,000. need stop fearful kids this. There's 100x bigger risk killing kid bringing peanut butter school infected COVID. Got damn vibes myself. Thank you!  think bit stretch. CDC delayed recommending masks, hasty drop masks. see sane person look CDC credibility anymore. This, social distancing recommendations also removed. unvaccinated/antivax wearing masks get close people.

Best parents, hope get vaccinated CDC stupid. put guideline full knowledge unvaccinated people wear mask. data saying safe considering total vaccination numbers. Right, long much viral load infectious others produce still studied.  microchip is...micro That's conspiracy theory: anti-vaxxers think vaccinated ""shedding"" vaccine. think that's inside job convince unvaccinated mask protect vaccine. chaotic good memetic superhero saving day. guys would annoyed waited five months turn CDC makes mind-boggling announcement even chance get fully vaccinated. vexing part people saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre partially vaccinated, stop complaining‚Äù ones lied eligibility cut line. know, remote workers claiming they‚Äôre frontline industry people said qualify smoker smoke BBQ (real shit people know did). CDC could‚Äôve waited weeks least given Phase 2 people PA NJ chance get fully vaccinated. gain that? agree stay home symptomatically ill.

Wearing mask symptoms ask here, though, seems like stretch compare two. reality, need justify asking people wear masks time going forward case they're infected something know it. Well live. Sorry everywhere function like places ""been""

My county struggling even uber. We're rural, poor, tribal. Things obviously can't imagine.

In pre-print study, Pfizer vaccine shown change way body reacted allergens like mold, fungus, etc. Could long term effect this? one knows yet, warrants investigation. There's still ton know vaccine. record, I'm fully vaccinated. certainly seem necessary subject children risk 99.992% immunity  Seems hard know given covid ""normal year masking."" There's simply data that, thankfully.  said, wants hit target 4.7 million that. think understandable. US, think lost something 500 kids last year disease killed 500,000 adults. That's pretty solid data kids much risk COVID.

It's also true dead kid trump rights, that's I'm saying. unlikely they'll test positive. very, unlikely show symptoms. Therefore, very, very, unlikely pass virus. thought end pandemic come forget ever existed now? /s   Covid variant starts every reply ""we got us sayin' fo dat Missippi"". ...and fence might get nudge need get vaccinated, since milquetoast approach luxury masked world help avoid make real choice. masks, courage convictions: vaccinate don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù  opinion ""co-director Center Vaccine Development Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital"" relevant choosing vaccinate themselves? Seems like picking pretty narrow set guidelines trust. Thank you! vast majority Americans though, fear COVID unhealthy driven surrender freedom, autonomy, even financial wellbeing state, despite COVID serious threat narrow population segments. 12 year old comment would make sense kids could get vaccinated.

I‚Äôve fine opening harm keeping masks bit longer indoors? Yes COVID less deadly flu kids think mitigation efforts. Many kids home majority last year wearing masks. would things looked like without measures? New variants also seem make younger individuals sicker.

I comfortable bringing son karate run errands everyone wearing masks. feel like stuck home summer he‚Äôs old enough vaccinated suddenly one needs masks. 

It‚Äôs mask ffs. nurse wearing N95 12 hours one break get super judgmental people whine wearing cloth mask short period time. It‚Äôs bad stops spread nasty disease. bottom line people selfish anything good community. science says still possible get COVID vaccinated, masks reduce risk wearer. point matter personal preference level risk comfortable with, smugly saying ""follow science"" unhelpful, also even really accurate. feel like ""why both"" girl moment.

I‚Äôm vaccinated no. like imply people killed overzealous mask wearers fact thousands lives saved mask mandates also strongly overlaps people would get sick don‚Äôt follow cdc guidance. I‚Äôm you, kids huge concern me. Replied detail above, I‚Äôm sure solution there...people downvote concerned children? could said virus.

The argument people make vaccine might dangerous children therefor safest thing get covid soon possible, head deskiest argument I've ever heard.  states mask bans? ‚ÄúMarginalized groups‚Äù every opportunity get vaccinated. they‚Äôre they‚Äôre free make choices double mask stay home. 

Children anything approaching serious risk virus. They‚Äôre fine. 

My private medical information private. Requiring people share strangers allowed live life NORMAL science says able unacceptable. 

If you‚Äôre comfortable vaccinated CHOOSING wear mask distance people MIGHT need make personal decision live differently force others comply paranoia. Plenty non-mRNA vaccine available, too. Stop making excuses. 

You still apart ""experiment"" even refuse vaccine. part control group.  bar manager strictly enforcing policies last year dealt sorts shit seems wild me. don‚Äôt renew passports, drivers licences sorts reasons. permit employers hire people sorts reasons. Don‚Äôt forget children also population cohort least amount severe COVID cases deaths, children likely die influenza COVID. weren‚Äôt masking children every flu season prior this, really doesn‚Äôt make sense keep masked now. Another take(more leftward) you‚Äôre bad parent masking kids even COVID.    always concern too. toddler infant start lives. cannot imagine saddling lifelong health conditions conscience.

What want play sports, lungs allow it? energy live lives? sense taste forever destroyed? want kids affects fertility? much could life shortened much joy could stolen one thing? ‚ÄúYour dead kid doesn‚Äôt trump rights‚Äù. get it. It‚Äôs shitty attitude get it. wearing mask really ""giving lives""? 1% 1%..um.. 36% us population fully vaccinated, always simply they've chosen be. minors count people you? Cause recently able get vaccinated many places. Basically 0 people 15 vaccinated. We're halfway herd immunity months vaccines available. really big burden wear mask minutes takes buy fucking coffee? couple months almost certainly achieved herd immunity levels vaccination. can't one tiny thing couple months? 

People lie putting risk. 1, vaccines perfect virus still spreading, makes sense take absolutely minimal precaution. 2, virus spreads mutations see. Eventually may see mutations current vaccines protect against. get again. outcome want?

Wearing mask just.. big deal. hard. restrict ability conduct life normal. understand people arms it. upper arms, torso, feet, scalp, legs aren‚Äôt primary means communicating nonverbally. mask absolutely doesn‚Äôt make sense pieces clothing. took pfizer months ago. ok 1 st jab, 2 jab knocked ass 3 days. 

Jmo, totally worth üëå didn‚Äôt. went doctor shots really sick. couldn‚Äôt afford anything else. Oh sure. I'm seeing ever. People lucky enough get vaccinated months ago example cut line could care less people getting vaccinated fully protected.

People care themselves. fail recognize severity urgency situation maintaining mistrust experts know name public health. Yes, makes sense compare covid numbers flu numbers factor mitigation, rather flu numbers covid numbers do. I'm sorry apples-to-apples comparison ""disingenuous"" you.

 sure seem taking personally. I've advocated course action. I've presented accurate set facts. Private business refuse service reason anyone. Schools make accommodations immunocompromised kids. Mask mandates vaccine situation right. That‚Äôs opinion. Masks always protective vulnerable populations (age biggest one) vaccinated. parents 15 year old sister turned 16 next month. didn‚Äôt check age either asked parents. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è see become significant seasonal issue places abyssmally low uptake. Fear mind killer... What's shocking 2015 Mississippi highest vaccination rate children far.
I guess Trump Covid really brought antivax idealogy across party lines. kids entire year school virtually wore masks day school protect elderly. asks rules indoors save kids, guys say fair? fair mental sacrifice kids adults? 


Why sacrifice health, wealth &amp; career protect need protecting ? data clear kids almost zero risk, sucks immunocomprosided. picking tab next two months ? sure hell can't afford two months work &amp; fiscal support. 


I lockdown since November, work entire hospitality industry nuked orbit. qualify neither unemployment, pua UK's furlough despite busines countries. industry can't surive losing summer trade &amp; personally enough return US work. Conditionally job lined industry allowed open otherwise, yeah shudder cotemplate ....



Sorry done part, followed rules made sacrifices asked me. data says time ease restrictions &amp; get people back work. doing, luck I'll able dig pandemic financial blackhole. Well, know reading it. quick search shows someone really misses going conventions, glad know things improving. Hopefully cons able resume without COVID restrictions come rest year. would hate cons forever required masking distancing. would really bad. Shit man.. got vaccinated heard anything this.

I hope true.. save money trouble actually going getting vasectomy.  tiny minority adults can‚Äôt get vaccine kids less twelve extremely well covid? Joe Biden really politicized whole situation CDC sent many mixed messages. ‚ÄúTrust science‚Äù everyone Reddit become doctor. Telling people it‚Äôs ok stop wearing masks honestly really stupid idea.

I understand reasoning behind it, realize people already don‚Äôt want wear don‚Äôt want vaccinated take opportunity justify themselves.

After there‚Äôs way tell someone walking street vaccinated not. understanding it‚Äôs one India.   absolutely fault. 

Is fault directly? No. supporting new mask mandate wearing mask, also allowing anti vaxxers take advantage new policy wear masks. although fault, **care** empathy.

People like allowed get vaccinated recently could experience like waiting months get vaccine, finally get it, government say basically nobody wear masks anymore even though fully protected. 

But hey - point view reflection people care themselves.  literal definition person antivaxxer  I‚Äôm bit concerned honest. I‚Äôve got asthmatic son diabetic son going back daily person schooling. think data consistent children low risk around trust pediatricians advice. I‚Äôm still concerned could spread others possibly spread resistant variants coming years. 

With adults vaccinated current variants, children become risk can‚Äôt get vaccinated don‚Äôt want to. former hope solution found for, later deal results guess. Yep. 14 year old got first day eligible. actually excited it. majority friends classmates scheduled get too. (Weird see almost cool get it. asked anyone wasn‚Äôt getting it, disappointed rolling eyes responded ‚Äúyeah‚Äù). didn‚Äôt need say anything needed get it, must get it. made determination soon became available December. day 1 wanted get it. (To clear, going get it, matter what). nice hear say wanted it. Oh right, using numbers season everyone stayed home wore masks relevant disingenuous all. It‚Äôs averaging 100-200 normal year. Center Disease Control literally says plain English flu larger risk children. need see?

The resistance return normality vaccinated frankly shocking.   feel seems little premature. 


It also puts employees stores keep mask requirement risk abusive anti-maskers use reason wear mask.  People creatures habit. really think people exactly going rip masks scream heavens moment local governor says so. Maybe whole thing happened couple intense months, going slow wear-down people wear masks forget to, think. Obviously people really hate masks can't wait take lot people worked routine it'll taper slowly. True, asking adults continue wearing mask indoors young children vaccinated big deal. don‚Äôt yet know long term effects virus. keep mandates place EVERYONE eligible get vaccine? prioritizing wearing piece cloth face potential long term health consequences children? think shortages issue least several years. ever completely eliminate flu Covid, though. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre right, either way - exactly suggest course action here?  enforce first place. Maskless assholes walk anyway live. Boy mad dog people wear though. carrying around completely voluntary external tracking device called smartphone! Eventually newspaper publish article headline ""COVID ages 20 years"". young now, they? Cases never going back except occasional minor spike there. many vaccinated naturally immune. need vaccinate naturally immune people, count too. Remember CDC director proclaimed IMPENDING DOOM spike? Also, cases mean anything, hospitalizations deaths. Cases deaths already decoupling vulnerable got vaccinated first. basically US.

Nearly half population got 1st dose (which works too!!!). That's strat UK used infection curve nosedived ours. Plus, entire summer vaccines fall. ...And many leave ***never*** working office? large minority. said lol

If going read study/poll, could least read rest decline mostly due Americans reporting ""always"" working home. April, 52% adults reported always working remotely. declined lowest point 33% September held steady since then, percentage reporting always working home last month.

So one three Americans still basement. people returned office, even go every day. Exactly. risk enough time get vaccinated.  September. uses ears antenna 5G /s   also avoid cars, airplanes, streets, parks, hiking trails, bath tubs kids died using them?

I've got four kids I'm talking talk. can't live life paralyzed fear things hurt got let kids same. cost you. can‚Äôt park close. It‚Äôs mild inconvenience. Like mask wearing.  sub divorced science since beginning.

Screaming people going beach family.

Being mad people wearing masks beginning pandemic.

Jumping every variant one that's going throw us back lockdown.

Continuously spouting natural immunity would short months evidence support statement (and evidence direct contrary).

Literally every thing pushed certain group people sub (not saying everyone) moving goalposts long time. low deaths, low infection rates, vaccination percentages, ""we can't open kids get vaccinated even though flu literally dangerous children COVID.""

Every step way, group people sure exist resisted opening effort, despite scientific backup. Remember Texas dropped capacity limits mask restriction 3 months ago? spike, infact, cases rose week plummeting. assured doomsday like spike would coming.

The goal first foremost make death preventable make sure COVID handleable healthcare system. Death preventable vaccines. data countries, Healthcare system longer threat US. measures ending. goals met.

We need restrictions requirements get this. necessary anymore. Yes, doubt. going get immunity hard way, eventually, we‚Äôll get there. Bingo

I'm place even contract I'll likely never know transmit vaccine keeping viral load null purged system 

So trust people new cdc guidance may convinced people get vaccine, got 2nd dose place crowded, quite bit got first. 

I got first Saturday well day week. pretty much adults there, opening 12-15.

May anomaly differences crowd would great vaccine numbers start going up! Worship Nurgle, get gifts. 
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Holy shit lost common sense last year?

On public transit? Mask up, store? Probably good idea now. Walking street? probably good without one. Hanging vaccinated people? Dump mask.

Can use common sense please here? confusing... That‚Äôs literally said. I'm talking general. Governors lifting mandates saying ""fully vaccinated people need wear masks"". Thanks answering.

That makes sense. Wearing one felt weird first, too. takes time adjust. Try contacting house-call doctors state. See vaccine available. Many not. Even though may right equipment able keep vaccine cold simply yet access vaccine. cadre people entertain idea people lying gaming system whatever. honest forthright assume everyone else too. people family like this.

I find charming, wish world actually way.    Plummeting strong word  office, since working office voluntary, send copy vaccination card HR. want send one go office company events.  Aren‚Äôt unvaccinated people likely end taking room hospitals though - space us could need reason? Legit question. idea capacity situation is. curbside unvaxxed rest us get shop Yeah. Redditors idea virus mutate infinitely without regard spike protein gives power Followed little back March started reading sub again. sort co-mingling contact tracing vaccine passports. 

There lot early proposals using people's phones track movements great detail, keep track whether ""near"" someone else turned COVID carrier. AFAIK crashed burned, including pretty large program UK. one thing, physical proximity sufficient determine whether someone exposed infected, almost alerts false positives. believe working contact tracing systems Southeast Asia elsewhere rely old-fashioned shoe leather, obviously expensive require number cases small relative population.

Setting electronic vaccine passport system sounds like utopian thinking country can't even relatively simple things well, like unemployment insurance sign-ups ACA enrollment website (let alone building tunnel Manhattan New Jersey!) punished?

By wear mask pure theater vaccinated?

Yep, 3 weeks since 2nd shot nothing worry about.

I'm worried virus. I'm tired wearing mask. Oh VARIANTS! could give 2 shits variants, people worry ones aren‚Äôt vaxxed. I'm curious.

Did drop /r/Coronavirus?

My default thought regular reader would could get vaccinated soon could. article estimates 10M. seem pretty good data set. Pretty much had, also hungry. seem common reactions. trust you? don‚Äôt! don‚Äôt really care. feels CDC finally realizing masks don‚Äôt work without admit wrong time - China happy selling billions masks 56% always sometimes working remotely leaves 44% always working office. Imagine getting long covid symptoms 6 deal rest life. feel like remaining vaccine hesitant going swayed science might actually appropriate create pro-vaccine misinformation. shot shown dramatically increase penis size people vaccinating take caution massive uncontrollable manhood could release. Spam everywhere.

Such approach super honest/ethical conspiracy, dryly stating facts seem work. punished?

Ate vaccinated? nothing worry about. It‚Äôs switch. It‚Äôs like 14 days second shot ‚Äúbecome‚Äù immune. It‚Äôs rising since minute got first one. Plus there‚Äôs individual variation, bodies different. would worried you. here. it‚Äôs almost 15 months :-( people experts?

Why continually forget natural immunity? need everyone vaccinated achieve herd immunity.

Natural immunity + vaccinations (minus overlap) / total population = actual immunity I'd rather get vaccine, get pregnant. Covid what's dangerous pregnant women fetuses. live Massachusetts- seen someone inside store without mask year, basically.  Expecting vaccination rate go likely incorrect. vaccination rate continually dropping rapidly. 12-15 group help slow slowdown, unlikely cause vaccination rates actually start going again. sensible business owner going invest state 70% workforce likely get debilitating disease knocked workforce weeks year. EO says business cannot refuse business based vaccination status, say business cannot give special status vaccinated. According way law written, Disney could argue well within law make unvaccinated guests continue wear mask property, refusing entry service. know do. 6G must right around corner. want make sure get installed latest greatest. might another 14 months vaccine approved fully rolled kids 12 realistic

The compromise adding schools list places they're still required CDC Mask mandate got lifted city yesterday like one reads news. I'm shopping Costco WalMart feel like douche lol Except characters. Mickey without mask would awful. took millions covid cases make like, 5 variants? Again, better chance getting struck lightning causing COVID mutate  everybody sub saying days end. It‚Äôs turning echo chamber. new unique take, it‚Äôs borderline karma farming. super spread want. Part announcement masks CDC saying evidence suggests vaxxed people transmit.

Here's [data Israeli general population, Pfizer reduced asymptomatic infection 94%. Preliminary data Israel suggest people vaccinated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine develop COVID-19 four-fold lower viral load unvaccinated people.29 observation may indicate reduced transmissibility, viral load identified key driver transmission vaccine triggers body react got infected virus. literally impact fertility, covid hand negatively impact fertility. Purple need time catch think parents lost children covid hospitalized MIS-C would disagree I‚Äôm going say. aren‚Äôt cases awesome lucky, vaccinated social distancing. I‚Äôve curbside it‚Äôs convenient. ‚ÄúShop‚Äù phone pajamas, pull up, somebody else puts car? Lazy person dream come true. vanishingly small, even *somehow* contract Covid situation, chances ending *any* symptoms anything equivalent slight cold exponentially vanishingly smaller. That‚Äôs whole reason behind getting vaccine ‚Äî bring technical zero Covid, effectively make cases irrelevant. think mask works one way? think Stops droplets going coming in? see reason vaccinated continue wearing mask. Wow, never heard one before, new original take. Fall 6 months away...  guaranteed. said keep vaccinating rate are, should. 100% sure exactly 2 months reached herd immunity.

And people wear fucking mask spread odds new mutations goes down. comparing flu mutates much COVID. flu new dominant strain (much different variant, call level mutation amount) every year, new vaccines required. New variants COVID much less different new strain would be, yet see indication COVID even able mutate new strain, much less done so. sure going comment.... Incomplete passive voluntary reporting means nobody following vaccinated people giving Covid tests asking they‚Äôre doing. way CDC knows breakthrough cases patient reason gets Covid test reports back CDC. Asymptomatic infections definitely underrepresented, people infected Covid would ever discover infected Covid wouldn‚Äôt symptom-related reason get Covid test. 

I imagine would extremely expensive, also complicated far personal privacy regulation goes, type follow breakthrough infections incomplete passive voluntary reporting. 

Some countries may thorough data, doesn‚Äôt sound like anything CDC would ever expected able get USA. vaccine passport would helpful beneficial literally everyone. I‚Äôm free WiFi chip Exactly. shut decade waiting? deal quick booster shot gets here. People who've survived SARS natural immunity COVID. seems unlikely variant would arise 100% different. *cries California*  line. reach vaccination rates 60-70%. Exactly we've hoping whe time.The irony lot people complain masks also plan get vaccinated. ones caused last long.

Again.. wearing mask really big deal. not. People act like effect life aside keeping people safe. dont.. go literally things always done. pretty bizarre view say ""normal"" covid accounts mitigation ""normal"" flu not. there's really way say herd immunity happen couple months stated. one suggested shut downs. issue continue mask another months kids vaccinated.  No, see covid vehicle kind social change. I've seen people know post angry rants whenever something starts get back normal. Guess what? never rant covid spread whatever mitigation measure lifted, always something another social injustice cause.

My favorite people using covid excuse rant capitalism.

We change entire lifestyle take social causes, keep people dying covid, that's happening restrictions backdoor whatever else someone wants accomplish.  Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty normal feel tired. immune system using energy usual mounting response. Rest up, you‚Äôll feel better time. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Why would disproportionately high number previously infected people vaccinated? 

I‚Äôd put number line national numbers. 

If anything lot people could careless/don‚Äôt think COVID aid big deal hence got infected. 

Or know natural immunity therefore don‚Äôt think need vaccinated. 

Both scenarios would drive number down. $3 raise 400k people working 30 hour weeks almost $2 billion dollars. Even $22 million straight cash could‚Äôve given employees, would‚Äôve one time $55 payment 400k people.

what long term effects catching covid vaccinated ""break through"" infection? true, don‚Äôt think justifies abnormal societal behavior witnessing.

Ok requiring person smartphone able buy food grocery store. also requiring people smartphones ensure charged operational going said business. 

I understand sentiment, seems useless borderline dystopian. say sounds useless time applications developed deployed extensively, vaccination rate US high enough levels required health screening needed. 

We see, example, Israel, vaccination rate around 60%, confirmed cases plummeted near negligible levels. would presume see similar scenarios countries reach level. got banned suggested wait efficacy vaccines variants tested freak fuck out. banned spreading misinformation. 

Turns relatively good protecting variants. circle (those interact with) many people? 8? even fraction. 

That mentality always make sound dumb. Source? That's thing, conflict. 

It HORRIBLY broadcast, CDC told people announcement still abide local regulations, including states businesses. right there, really plain language. everyone go WOOHOO, END MASKS!

I'm retail worker, I've spent whole pandemic mask-enforcer, mandated state company work for. I'm happy exit role. But, state's mandate still effect. company's regulations still effect. ask customers patience since every level decision making stuff got absolutely blindsided announcement. delay days week? mad way communicated let mechanisms place adjust. still operate existing rules, includes requiring every customer wearing masks. C'mon now, worked least 1000x harder could say he's UNDERPAID.

Or character meets except distance.


Just you‚Äôre within 6 ft you‚Äôre moving doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôd considered close contact. clearly long states shut down, convenient say otherwise.

I mean imply that's it, clear guess. timing observation, number cases important factor me. Oregon re-opened hardly cases test positivity rate 1%. GA TX reopened cases still going up. Thus ""peeing pool"" outbreaks stay within borders. 

I'm business comparing states' covid-19 response course entire pandemic. There's many variables control for, mention inconsistencies data sets (eg. Oregon counted ""tests"" differently every state pandemic). Comparing state's reopened little specific, especially contrast acute case vs GA/TX. 

I agree vaccinations, also prior infections. think big reason WA OR's late surge we've lowest numbers pandemic, less natural immunity. closed early (the Seattle nursing home deaths scared us), even NYC, early exponential curve. paid off. Oregonians could appreciate good fortune get damn vaccine. Tbf it‚Äôs really CVS got taxed, withhold taxes law.

Thanks, Kroger, looking customers. I‚Äôm sure reasons three six nine months ago understand needing make sure CEO gets paid. I‚Äôm sure care well customers much employees. people follow example. Flu shots existing kids still dying often flu covid shows flu dangerous covid. also doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre immune consequences said speech can't even get people agree limiting 150x base salary. see realize immunocompromised children?

CEO 10 million less mean anything, low level worker $3-$4 per hour raise could life changing... No, wore mask protect myself. got vaccinated protect myself. 

Your days mask shaming over. CDC says so. President. What‚Äôs going there?   used TJ's now. That's all. I‚Äôm bit misleading. hired agreement get paid certain salary, receive designated amount equity, bonus, perks. didn‚Äôt get extra 22 million could go employees pockets. got 6% increase previous years grocery revenues roof Covid. greedy, probably could‚Äôve received much higher increase previous years.

Doesn't tell something? Try harder... it... come on... closer... nearly there... Oof... gone. That's exactly stance Get back work, peasants! Actually it‚Äôs anywhere near thing. like: like babies, without developed morals. everything know studies, vaccines still effective variants studied far. studies show vaccines protect getting sick, also highly effective stopping spread vaccinated person carrier virus spread others. 

Studies also show people COVID also protected antibodies.

Immunity also switch. Even single dose vaccine highly effective 2-3 weeks getting it. 2nd helps reach maximum protection, people still protected high degree first dose. 

Problem none 100%. even something that's 95% effective means small percentage protected. Problem reddit lot talk small percentage population overwhelms conversation confuses effective vaccines are. effective. Okay even took entire salary spread among 500k kroger employees so, one gets...$40.

This outrage porn AZ screwing trials. thus know effacious really till got real numbers. Using India example poor choice. Although India large population poor impoverished, country whole plenty resources use fight COVID. India largest producer vaccines planet! peril find self-inflicted, reason world needs rush aid. Bad choices lead bad results - shocking, know.
 
I'm sorry put bluntly, that's cold hard truth.
 
Now, countries truly resources fight disease, absolutely, world leaders come together help way can. Glad see it! testament speed getting shots arms! I'm surprised we're waiting mid June still great feel right now. got first corporate supervisor gig Im sitting Reddit team work. eye opening... wear mask rather die admitting got vaccine...... suppose anti-masker...... drop mask...

oh boy... infinite loop classic chicken egg first. Good. Let brain burns ground. companies sucking CEOs dick like this? Make verifiable statistical claim.

Do really need cite unmasked unvaccinated people risk unmasked unvaccinated people? that's said science says. agree good way truly see made right wrong decision verified one two month intervals see change disease trend following guidance?

Maybe...maybe not. vaccines awesome might still bring cases downward despite unvaccinated people unmasked stores now. much lower would go unvaccinated still wear masks? 

(And yes know SUPPOSED still wear masks...but yeah let's idiots....they won't) want vax probably lie vax status Basically lot states various metrics restrictions would removed. basing percent vaccinated (usually 65%-70% adults, think). Others like CA said, June 15, aligns said giving last group ‚Äúeager‚Äù people time get fully vaccinated. Now, lot states away mask mandates immediately. timelines changed. Maybe kids 12. make sizeable portion population. 14 month old can‚Äôt wear mask, per CDC. we‚Äôll avoid going indoors however long vaccine ready available. mean healthcare setting?

Where CDC explicitly set exception unmasking?

Now know trouble following science. feel ashamed, difficulty reading problem lots people have. really rare all, 95% efficacy means 20x less likely get exposed. that's mRNA vaccine, J&amp;J around 66% means 3x less likely get it. real reason rare people fully vaccinated week two, enough time exposed COVID, especially rates plummeting.

However, there's lot bad math people estimate risk number breakthrough cases divided number vaccinated people. analysis useless, ""breakthrough risk"" number continue increase breakthrough cases happen even real risk decreases plummeting case rates. cynic thinks CDC stopped publishing info breakthrough cases formula promotes vaccines still looks valid.

Anyway, I'm pro vax, math degree understand BS going on. wish everyone would stop promoting vaccines false arguments, enough true arguments show great vaccines without giving ammo anti vaxxers. I'm going continue wearing mask weeks, suspect mid-June real power vaccines shine cases tanked. What's irrational protecting unvaccinated children basic precautions balancing reasonable activities? many test conduct per day? HK, capacity 400000 cases days &lt;2 cases. flying back USA, 7 tests span 3 weeks paper shows 25 year olds North America death rate 0.01 0.1%, 0.1% 38 year olds. say death rate lowest 5-9 age group 0.001%.

Not found, also still order magnitude 1 300 000 ask really election. even need ask vax 12-15 opened Wednesday won‚Äôt fully protected another five weeks. 11 vaccine. can‚Äôt get vaccinated.  Putting people close quarters outdoors like indoors. certainly cases trace happened circumstances Politely put, you... idiot. Tell what, get vaccinated volunteer Covid Ward.

Without face masks.

Keep us posted outcome that. Target bunch others going way, can‚Äôt blame them. 

Unvaccinated people supposed wear masks, Venn diagram anti maskers unvaccinated people might pretty high, retailers like Target don‚Äôt want deal headache. closing Kroger‚Äôs area less. Quite cities passed hazard pay ordinances [1]. probably right people making assumption though - testament used getting federal overreach (relative constitution allows - value judgement). Federal government pass eviction moratorium though - conveniently made ad populum argument - I'm well aware people non landlords therefore indifferent best unfair treatment doled - make right though.

It's almost 36 hours post shot feel normal.

Good luck! efficacy rates cannot compared directly. testing done different places different times. j&amp;j mostly facing variants. Pfizer moderna weren‚Äôt. 

Most likely equally effective. 

(That said, got Pfizer) mom, tell vast majority parents gaging risk based kid die not. There‚Äôs hell lot perfectly fine fucking dying worry about. Long Covid one them.

Probably dangerous thing ever child something that's part everyday routine. also get killed falling icicle urine airliner overhead dumping waste, look up, happened.

Better wear helmet outside. can't like ""SCIENCE says"". Make verifiable statistical claim. 

CDC's job control disease. infections deaths keep declining, one would say controlling it.

On hand, removal mask requirement vaccinated causes uptick spike infections, say premature wrong lift mask requirement. 

Would agree good way truly see made right wrong decision verified one two month intervals see change disease trend following guidance? 

Anyone sit say CDC right wrong new guidance. also trend infection death rates going forward see decision negative impact. didn't, CDC probably correct moving forward this. CEO‚Äôs private jet isn‚Äôt going pay itself. Everyone must sacrifice! #We‚Äôre together! Greed good! surge B117 variant, surge barely hit vaccinated groups all. reassuring, B117 variant circulating enough vaccines initially tested know much would protect it.

Noone going wearing mask 'freedom' going spread like wildfire. Hospital ICU beds available deaths continue rise come summer. wouldnt happen? feel like vaccines temporary like false feeling hope, see. got doses time being, still wear mask continue wear one foreseeable future. fashion something

Honestly, I've enjoyed going back stores getting vaccinated seeing masks different designs sale (had using home-sewed ones year). especially like clothing sets include outfit matching mask. cute! one thing accessorize. mean; yes no. protect severe disease. ideal would provided sterilizing immunity people could get infected. 

I think latter people hoping (and think lot population expected based exciting 95% numbers vaccine trials). 

The middle ground able get infected (though much lower risk serious disease) complicated/confusing people, harder concept health experts explain public. funny different must live live. I'm sure plenty antivaxers area, everyone wears masks stores. seen couple maskless shoppers since mandates enacted.  AIRES ‚Äî past year, Uruguay held example keeping coronavirus spreading widely neighboring countries grappled soaring death tolls.

I've never got flu vaccine, getting Covid vaccine considering reasoning risks there, I'm thinking getting flu vaccine going forward. don't. Obviously vaccinations everywhere eventually slow down. I'm curious think Canada somehow exempt this. It‚Äôs easy say they‚Äôre going keep wearing mask, one day they‚Äôll halfway grocery store realize forgot mask, won‚Äôt turn around. First two paragraphs question one

Third paragraph question two 280 characters now. tend towards verbosity writing nature. engaging Twitter taught virtues brevity, actually came enjoy artistic challenge carving thoughts concrete blocks text uniform length.

That said, none contradicts assessment Twitter's fundamental flaws.  I'm sure saw requiring outside tomorrow. So, keep reservations fun! day.  Yep. Brace surge weeks. UK numbers heading upwards since removed lock downs, even though 68% population least 1 dose. Kids required get flu vaccines flu deadly covid. Plus, kids great spreaders flu much covid. school safe enough kids now, safe either. Looks graph, ehh 58 people dying isn‚Äôt bad. 58 individual know least 10 people know 10 people know on. affect death widespread individual died. people lack complete self-awareness thought would learned locked inside year nope. Still haven‚Äôt learned thing going another wave. CDC estimates 35% Americans infected. Conformed cases fraction actual infections. Mercenary executives. Yes, take side effects start, you‚Äôre supposed take shot. Canada looking delicious! Let's real Kroger union anything workers. Unionization Kroger gives unions bad rep. Haha shut nerd Retail manager here: pretty much this. That‚Äôs want corporation populated sycophants. It‚Äôs insane amount payroll I‚Äôve seen disappear last decade. Yes, retail hurt e-commerce, leaders used excuse shittiest decisions imaginable drive customers Amazon‚Äôs open arms.

Also, need 80% vaccinated, need 80% (or whatever) previously infected vaccinated, everyone forget natural immunity? Pfizer's 2nd shock kicked ass...but basically 24 hr period tried sleep much possible. wants everyone take precautions protect her, take precautions help herself.

I thought premise thread title crazy, maybe not. People like relying everyone else keep protected may hand forced. Gotcha. Yeah, going tough little 12. Hopefully get vaccines approved age group soon. least fully vaccinated, kiddos low risk. Well lot places south it‚Äôs ‚Äúrequire‚Äù now. would surprised Kroger‚Äôs didn‚Äôt least sign requesting shoppers wear one.

Compliance varies Georgia depending close Atlanta. mask hard. policy bagging Thank you. auto mod deleting everything post even though I'm posting insults anything, meanwhile leaving lot dreadful posts. contributes crazy society went past year.

I‚Äôve wrong covid lot, I‚Äôm glad got prediction right. There'll spike, bad half country vaccinated. 175 million Americans still unvaccinated, definitely potential spike.

The imagine they'll permanent display least year. removal public health mandate free follow cause problem business? continue require masks want, not. nothing required warning.
 
Saying needed warning change like saying needed warning tax cut.  Went Walmart today pick wife's meds surprised see masks still worn everyone. think announcement though. probably last time visit Walmart months honest switch pharmacies.  mayor pull requirements county facilities? 12+ actually. Pfizer approved 12+ past Wednesday. Either way masks longer enforced, reason keep borders closed select countries either, worried about? surge? happen even borders closed. investigating potential lab leak like investigating aircraft accident. make sure happen again. fingers crossed! I'm hoping get finally visit Canada soon! Kroger stores Texas live require them. half people wearing masks weeks shop there. Former Ralphs associate. Honestly abandoned neighborhood years ago bullshit reasons remained loyal Ralphs shopper. closures Long Beach stores pandemic pay final straw me, heard describing here. top I'm hearing fucking nightmare store director they're running around pushing experienced non-union store leadership replacing eager 20 30 something's less half previously paid, least store director positions. Fuck Kroger. answer either questions. business owner Nashville, city article about. city announced every change pandemic restrictions 2+ days notice. city announced mask mandate would remain place CDC announcement Thursday. reversed announcement 5pm Thursday change going effect 12 hours later.

Contrast original start local mask mandate. Also announced Thursday, going effect following Sunday. MUCH greater public health risk delay first mandate one. one dick move. That‚Äôs part that‚Äôs impossible verify without violating HIPAA. One argue novel virus like novel problems, decisions made fly lack of, usually end best choice. Now, since I'm US, care ""my"" government react. Especially saw do. longer, ""oh, know"". argue hiding December(if even believe that). Videos going viral Jan. acted March. 

You talk shutting border. Glad brought up, cause refused shut border Europe Data showing actually getting carrier Europe bound. guess like listening Trump.

On top that, Trump keep saying know flu reality, KNEW downplayed it. would dumbass believe know. money spent CIA yr spy world think know jack? Please. stop mastering pointing fingers take responsibility.   That's dropping mask mandates fully vaccinated individuals. want get numbers up.

When employers check, cruises check, international travel checks, amusement parks check (in States), people personal, selfish reason get vaccinated. CDC giving answer people saying ""why bother? change anything."" Well everyone decide themselves, compare death rate cases VITT. even close everyone complications dies, skews fair bit. still even close ratio, exact numbers least order magnitude off. 

Also, really major complications vaccine, literally hundreds various complications Covid. die mean screwed. Long Covid joke, neither scarring lungs years whatever else randomly get even ""mild"" case. 

With said, 30s 18 years old, decision would much difficult worth waiting ~2-3 months turn another vaccine. calculations using 0.7% yearly death rate reported India 2019. maps approximately 95K deaths 71 days average 70M people. 123K reported approx 30K excess compared 2019. still 6x reported.

Your point remains though majority deaths expected, true. think follow Israel one, prove least get zero keep cases low. economy would better. Plus cases might stay low vaccines. stall high level stall low level? Confirmation vaccine real would require verification healthcare provider, that‚Äôs part HIPAA violation. Everyone heard conversation unvaccinated people may use fake vaccine cards. There‚Äôs way verify them.  walked store today fully vaxxed unmasked people literally jumped saw me. It‚Äôs going take bit people deprogrammed comfortable change. Yeah. 7 Yankees one club house great sign going shake real world application. got vaccinated, understand vaccine hesitance. getting shots, undeniably afraid extremely rare event death. Masks kill us unless anything innovative. numbers showed enough go around, wanted keep supply medical industry avoid panic. Also setting goal 100 million doses given within first 100 days term double goal quickly hit tons time left

And yeah, fast things moving CDCs big play kicking things high gear far fetched think might virtually back 2019 July 4th. keep mask mandates everybody since can't know actually vaccinated.

The CDC issued guidance specifically avoid businesses requiring masks everyone. want vaccination up, carrot get people it.

I've heard lot people Canada say ""what's point getting vaccinated, change anything?"" CDC gave people answer, people would get vaccines voluntarily already have. try push people fence vaccination. people want vaccines largely already least one.

There lot people going ""why vaccinated, I'm young COVID kills almost young people"". answer ""you avoid wearing mask work, work Wal-Mart pay $75 it.""

Travel going require vaccines, employers going require vaccines, people want lie. there's selfish reason everyone get vaccinated. 74 million contracted it? Weird, kids never did. can't possibly part death rate. actual rate 0.04% so, let rip summer get 50% infected, we'll lose 7-8,000 children. biggy. one care notice I'm sure. much areas really. Vaccination 48% entire population. Coupled prior infection resistance, likely areas quickly approaching, already achieved herd immunity. slacker states would pick would help lot. reason keep borders closed select countries either, worried about?

Variants. Specifically new strains resistant surge? happen even borders closed.

Unlikely significant degree. something like 95% deaths 60 crowd, got prioritized vaccines full vaccination, increase cases longer means surge death. Plus, half population vaccinated, going fewer people infect (as long variants kept out).

If obey restrictions, gathered lot, wear masks, probably got COVID degree immunity. got vaccinated, high degree immunity.

The virus running people infect, shows numbers. Probably $1750 (if good insurance) party pooper here, concerning extent. Amongst chaos going India right now, there's sub story gaining momentum. Indian Medical Association fighting government clarify vaccination status ~100 doctors lost lives getting 2nd dose Covidshield vaccine(AZ) (not sure numbers). mentioning ? doctors vaccinated first stage vaccination drive point, Indian government decided give 2nd dose 4 weeks apart. Later on, changed 6-8 weeks recently, revised 12 weeks. personally know couple elderly doctors lost lives quite time receiving second dose AZ. point concern people keep getting 4 week gap. putting information there. would imagine time cases get low enough nationally pushy ask people mask see banks start reinstate rules banning facial coverings 

Maybe get towards 5,000 new cases day sustain numbers low lower couple weeks Remember called crazy year ago even suggested ""definitely zoonic spillover"" might explanation? Science published articles definitely said origin, retract quietly later conflict interests form authors became apparent months later. Indeed. I'm 29. Got first shot within 3 days 16 eligibility state. became fully vaccinated Friday. gotten Moderna, another week. proactive since I'm unemployment, interest searching job fully vaccinated. could kids done school would even better, but, state disagrees, back work. Yeah stay home two three weeks, whole thing over. That's wonderful thing vaccines: work. Very, well.

So, long everyone wants one one, really matter people choose roll die COVID, especially vaccinated wear masks, social distance, use delivery want to. ‚ÄúAmong received two vaccine doses date, 57% Sinopharm 43% Covishield AstraZeneca.‚Äù

More reason prefer mRNA vaccines. gotta show proof kid vaccines send public school example

Schools bit different (like foreign travel), health privacy regulations laws, public school requirements laws. legislature require vaccinations legislature wants.

Private businesses quite bit constrained things.

In California (for example), religious exemption vaccination California Fair Employment Housing Act, among things. There's also anti-retaliation clause, claim vaccine disproportionately harms minorities (which likely case, given disparities healthcare), refusal participate protected Actual data Israel shows [the Pfizer vaccine reduces even asymptomatic infection Please generalize one cluster contradict established data. use say worrisome things J&amp;J vaccine (which's still huge minority immunizations given US), nothing - even would speculation. Good point brought WNBC-4 Bruce Beck dig deeper got fully vaccinated would wear mask? think honest answer cats bag. get many cases worldwide, could take 10 years eradicate, ever. that‚Äôs okay. Israel chance temporarily get near 0 open borders cause cases spring up. USA getting 0 anytime soon could probably aim like 1000 per day something Wait, think cases along one noticed? won‚Äôt Israel get zero cases? I‚Äôm sure might case mini outbreak there, can‚Äôt Covid like small pox measles rather flu. 

SARS MERS went away. noble effort. self preservation. vaccines go far. eliminate virus need assist countries struggling. True, depending jurisdiction discrimination basis medical condition may incur liability.

Saying ""no people respiratory issues"" really acceptable ""no people mobility issues"". Reasonable accommodations made, even person technically capable getting wheelchair walking stairs (for example).

When hundreds thousands dying pandemic, what's ""reasonable"" terms accommodations may limited, especially given CDC guidance. store going beyond CDC State guidance, accommodation minimal, risk limited due vaccinated employees customers, lot harder categorically banning people need accommodations, prying medical history good either.

In short, days trespass wearing mask going largely come end point distant future, especially places strong disability accommodations. Well, never said donated since Canada pay vaccines. Hopefully, outlook summer looking good bordering countries NA. Israel fantastic sure, zero Covid happening places. name game mitigate. It‚Äôs endemic virus. learn live minimize deaths hospitalizations access, get th vaccine that's us. reddit liberals shit attitude. Constant negativity whining terrible everyone else is. Tired it. That's true. city unlawful wear mask business pre pandemic. suspended end restrictions. So, June 2nd here, illegal mask public. makes feel better, efficacy vaccine enough get approved normally one dose. Pfizer Moderna went two doses maximize efficacy, one dose sufficient normal standards.

Given percentage get vaccinated, second dose going help herd immunity, still get it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It really weird situation Arizona again, realizing banks feel better someone walks open carrying gun *with* mask, would someone walks open carrying gun without one. Oh. Sorry. agreeing you. trying sound accusatory. 

Unfortunately, state market people actually force different regulations. still can.

I think right extent things like globalization automation lose runway point it'll catch them. I'm worried regulators entirely captured point moot. light switch trying maximize immunity.

It would poor optics offer ""privileges"" general availability. certain percentage population would get vaccinated matter what, waited make sure vaccines available.

Now are, flipping script - trying offer benefits sway undecided. lot people willing lie, anti-vax crowd going get vaccinated matter what, maximize shots arms offering ""privileges"" return normalcy carrot sway undecided.

It works better done once, that's way. knew vaccinated people safe gather months ago, like common knowledge field COVID surface transmission rare last July so.

They held changing recommendations wanted people feel like something stay safe, might help slightly. vaccine availability ramped up, admitted ""hygiene theatre"", recommended making people feel safer be.

In short, trying get shots arms, ultimately virus ends control. politicizing it, order try deal political realities. Same. I‚Äôm going give time others get comfortable wear required. probably shift places don‚Äôt mandates choice though. big corporate stores, pretty strongly, lot someone right door. go small business rural USA communities, much sometimes even all. Sometimes business owner conservative give f covid, times business owner exasperated exhausted saves energy biggest idiots getting face without mask. ""who nothing really""

Replace ceo board 15 year olds, see company go south immediately recommended fully vaccinated don‚Äôt wear mask, obviously still follow local private business guidelines energy placed getting unvaccinated folks vaccinated (or masks) getting vaccinated folks wear masks.

For part, anyone US wants one get one, although still holdouts due economic hardship need addressed. Yeah it‚Äôs tough. Thank advice. seems extremely high efficacy even one dose?

Isn‚Äôt gap 100% supposed people don‚Äôt develop immunoresponse? would mean 1% don‚Äôt develop it??!?

That seems high. good quality study? Nobody saying closed forever, need get cases zero. 

Look country Israel, reporting less 30 cases day, entire country. probably large swaths places locally cases zero, people get back life without much worry. able bring cases zero likely keep small exceptions real soon. waited bit vaccine (bad history allergic reaction), hundred million administered, went it.

Given vaccines nearly 100% effective stopping death severe hospitalization, seems pretty straightforward system anyone wants one get one. die, that's - going cause harm.

Meanwhile, someone severe asthma made worse getting COVID last year, nice ditch mask. really make harder breathe, I'm giving *you* COVID either. Idk it‚Äôs taxed 40% federal higher highest marginal rate... guess it‚Äôs viewed windfall? Misleading headline. Uruguay highest deaths per capita last week. overall death toll per capita 50th highest world. 10 highest reported overall death rates per capita European countries. That's really true. I'm curious we've seen vaccination rate fall every country lot (because duh, eventually to, even get 100%),but assuming happen Canada. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Pffft don‚Äôt want that‚Äù Yeah don‚Äôt get all. 
And private doctors can‚Äôt administer vaccines.. 
It looking like fastest well getting vaccinated either Dermatologist eye doctor . I‚Äôm serious thing AZ slightly riskier profile young Pfizer/Moderna. such, reasonable choice, try minimize risk.

In either case, one risks COVID blood clots, much higher rate AZ. Early on, AZ necessary ramp places like Canada 2% change fully vaccinated, safer get fully vaccinated go without. get people 60+, significantly so. decisions fine agree you. country low prevalence individual risk even lower average risk/benefit doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

That is, get another one later. it‚Äôs thing available would take it. it‚Äôs difference 3 months would wait out.

The risk incredible low probably learn it‚Äôs even lower predict right manage low risk exposure seems fine wait out. Specially don‚Äôt feel good option. 

Again: decisions fine rational. Sadly store's corporate decided hold another couple months CEO obsessed messaging apply fully pulling back chains COVID measures certain date 

Much chagrin store's head manager wants done since entire staff fully vaccinated we're county less 50 active cases insanely low community transmission. cutting sleep affect vaccine's efficacy? Got first Pfizer-BioNtech dose yesterday Wonder good idea stay late. 3 people work place yet vaccinated. They've ample time get (legitimate) reason to. face face people every day. Honestly, point, ether get don't. get COVID, that's them. I'm adjusting entire life them. 

I can't tell infuriating sit listen preach anti-science misinformation rhetoric. words, I'm emotionally exhausted like many others, I'm throwing towel people. time start getting back track. Ah, wonders statistics. 

Its province 70M people, expect averge life expectance 70 years, would expect nearly 200k deaths within 71 days simply natural causes.

This says nothing covid underreporting, headline CLEARLY intends use 123k big number give wrong impressions.
Poeple REALLY bad getting big numbers seems. idiocy like urn counter Wuhan year ago.  comes fifth wave. I've heard people express similar sentiments. odd. think everyone who's anti vacc also anti mask, so. felt like nasty flu around 12 hours second Moderna shot. Wisconsin didn‚Äôt mask mandate end July 2020. gave weeks work sent college kids school around August 15th. got infected sent home seed virus every community Wisconsin. September 1stish majority school districts started person learning extent. 

We never gave masks time needed work, significantly increased social mobility. 

I think data analyzed could virus beat added masks day one, made smart decisions. February like South Korea could avoided lockdown completely, kept cases low. related news, drive theaters longer requiring wear seat belt watching movie. Yup. I'm defending it. firms need realize though they're going get pay for. worked internet start-up 2005, started outsourcing work India. literally rebuild entire company scratch (which would take months) vs taking **years** sort huge mess made outsourcing labor. think Canada need type vaccination passport that. think they've settled one yet. won‚Äôt. live red area. reality. probably pretty safe point, yeah Yankees ""outbreak"" clear vaccinated individuals carry disease well enough test positive it. real question is, test positive, spread it. Vaccinated individuals may like ""persistent positive"" people. people covid, shed detectable, broken non infectious virus 90 days long contagious. Maybe vaccinated people thing, sooner. Good wearing mask makes feel comfortable. want kids getting shit either. Can't wait get vaccinated. become worried may around mask-less people aren‚Äôt vaccinated, isn‚Äôt additional motivation go get vaccinated? goal 70% adults least 1 dose. already 59%. I'm going remain hopeful. mean, aside questions privacy, political expediency, anything else, ship 100% sailed. large portion population vaccinated without real proof. worry symptoms long haulers endure? permanent issues sinuses already give enough grief nearly daily want add another issue mix. I've waiting hear long hauler complications fully vaccinated need take caution still. Congrats Thanks, please spread word too. one feels way except moron liberal governors like Newsom anti mask/anti vax friend shared local mandate dropped, SPECIFICALLY said vaccinated need wear mask still goes ""FINALLY!!!!"" posted went grocery store without mask first time ""over year"" (to wanted ask voluntarily wore mask 2+ months county mandated lol) going prove someone vaccinated not?! policy mainly means everyone wants go without mask, vaccinated not. Uh that‚Äôs exactly Wrong flair mate one says 50: guess couple different options they‚Äôre working on. Hate species? Sheez. 

I hate mosquitoes, thats According evolutionary biologists, lab viruses evolve differently natural viruses, understanding virus came could important projecting fight virus going forward. matter. I'd bet people government right would LOVE people get branded tattooed mark compliance lack of. mathematically true, kids really get affected covid. Hundreds thousands adults died it. true. ""Why sure got Covid shots. Leave alone. (cough cough)"" individual perspective yes, ideal get 95% immunity fast possible.

From epidemiological societal perspective might ideal give twice many people 80% immunity timeframe. think that? everyone gets immunity (I think number saw 84%?), chances reinfected also depends variants (some like P.1 South Africa likely evade natural immune system).  
My friend parents got COVID 3 time already lol

(Yes, RT PCR tests, enough interval infections symptoms, time stronger ones) pretty specifically said ‚Äúif offered vaccine...‚Äù

And chances child becoming seriously ill incredibly slim. Yeah can‚Äôt prove vaccinated. ‚ÄúYou vaccinated? Yup.‚Äù anyone, vaccinated not, go maskless. Curious, what‚Äôs Venn diagram latter functioning alcoholics? ovular slightest, perfect circle? like you! CDC got hacked basically means required masks indoors unvaccinated either. weird: general feel like CDC moved slowly, seems maybe 1-2 weeks premature.

Doubtlessly need get back normal point. me, though, might vote wait little bit everyone who's wanted get vaccine go whole course. Like got vaccine essentially right soon able, barely considered fully vaccinated. I'm sure many others quite yet, plus waiting would give additional couple weeks rapid decline we're seeing easily continue make safer immunocompromised.

Anyway, pretty clear I'm minority sub. 2 cents study compares infections among vaccinated unvaccinated people, shows vaccinated people 95% fewer infections. reason masks would something vaccinated people wearing masks lot more. wouldn‚Äôt worry it. cases start go you‚Äôll see vaccination numbers increase well. Awesome. I'm 1 1/2 hours Vancouver, one favorite cities, can't wait go back. got vaccinated last Monday Pfizer (yay!) - 2 weeks would coming Monday. still estimated 80% protection efficacy 2 weeks first dose? I‚Äôm going anything crazy it‚Äôll help feel better going work walking outside without mask time. I‚Äôve never establishment! What's real number? backwards number vaccinated intentionally exposed. Shits pure propaganda   That‚Äôs I‚Äôm fine still practiced haha I‚Äôm like well one positive think CostCo CEO like lowest paid CEO fortune 500 company something like that. coincidence. weird everyone's rushing vaccinate kids. Literally data shows even covid symptoms among kids insanely rare, even serious complications/deaths. Serious question, Covid antibodies vaccine contain part virus? read link posted attacked me? need know kind airtight mask blocks smells too... Gonna need context. live? vaccinated? still put mask dog public. always runny nose likely it'll increase number liars.  curiosity tho study done one lockdown phases masks worn basically times? Cause could leading high efficacy numbers? I'm doubting numbers I've always curious much may helping causes data That's really correct way assess this. question ask much would cost pay hazard pay salaries specific locations shut stores response hazard pay. don‚Äôt feel like vaccine enough protection could keep wearing mask, unrealistic expect everyone change way living accommodate some. Ouch. probably banned soon. people want vaccine people trying hold back. want everything opened yesterday. worried Indian variant? Oh good another state government believes vaccines= infection. Sigh Hmm.. that‚Äôs awful close Covid denier line. Yeah we‚Äôre talking vaccinated people wear masks. nothing this. It‚Äôs definitely become security blanket, disease social anxiety. didn‚Äôt realize could comforting. Personally would like mask wearing socially accepted long term cultures Japan South Korea.

Can't make shit up. fair may decided there's far worse things COVID get smeared shopping cart continuing wipe Moderna's second gen vaccine, mRNA-1283, would likely booster, actually uses 10mcg, 30mcg, 100mcg doses clinical good idea

!remind 3 weeks counted 5 6 separate fees one order. order. situation, $10 somehow turned $20. He's overly cautious, think negative thing. Remember, mind vaccine 100% always people lie vaccinated carrying virus. knows many types mutations virus bouncing around. I'm still going wear mask long possible safety wife's safety. strictly enforced? tell area wasn‚Äôt difference Oh absolutely. We've total 909 people die (the overwhelming majority deaths corona spread Melbourne nursing homes), 7 deaths state Qld (some internationally acquired). significant community spread since March/April 2020. metrics far better placed European countries.

But wonder pandemic end, can't keep shut world forever. mean throw hands discredit whole field.  discrediting imperfect system got us errors

Except that's they're all. They're saying scrutiny integral science, through, top bottom. such, blindly accepting claims, even scientists, without scrutiny anti-scientific. That's science gets polluted dogma, illuminated article. Excessive incompetence. sides. (People government.) Look. get it. You‚Äôre different situation. defending results less ideal situation. There‚Äôs lot stake. Half dose better dose. One dose AZ/J&amp;J even better. That‚Äôs good hear. We‚Äôre going get eventually. I‚Äôll honest figured we‚Äôd wearing masks least next spring. (Hell I‚Äôm Mass may still true). CDC announcement shocked good way. Publix WalMart now, too. wearing mask forever even everyone vaccinated, covid still spreads. consequences unvaxxed though, they‚Äôll much higher chance getting hospitalized, choice, least nurses doctors protected. vaccinated would care?

1. people think unvaccinated people infecting other? prediction see sparks outbreaks. people get seriously ill aren‚Äôt vaccinated.

2. people think unvaccinated people infecting vaccinated vulnerable people- like nursing home staff infecting elderly vaccinated? prediction unvaccinated staff get infected maybe now. sure.

3. people think incentive unvaccinated people get vaccinated? increased decreased?

Lol. person easily annoyed moronic behavior. literally takes 5 minutes vaccinated. like this. 

I vaccine, still wear mask. worried people take wrong way think I'm vaccinated. lots different numbers, based age groups: fingers crossed one step forward 2 steps back

Though slower, vaccination numbers continue climb every day cases falling. (Once again, regions better others) probably like ten steps forward one step back.

But either way, still absurd people problem wearing mask. Absolutely nothing gained removing it. dominoes started falling. think vaccine passports truly dead. think private companies ask prove vaccination status. Schools, colleges yes that's it. Write down! Write down! ya, maybe january, still lockdown ontario Would love see much Chris Gheysens made Wawa employees. Oh, sure risk low per person-interaction. multiply 1500 people 5 days/week.  1300 maskless, 800 unvaccinated. It‚Äôs like driving, dangerous per mile - even less safe commute two hours day way every single day. 

Plus lots regulars. **hate** idea one kid wears Batman costume getting hospitalized family already broke, grandma iron-stiff-sprayed curls dying remembered Tuskeegee didn‚Äôt trust vaccine also unvaccinated family got killed. already lost several people way among staff volunteers vaccines prevalent. Realizing kids come going end really sick older relatives even worse makes mad sad.

At least required masks strictly limited capacity job knew something discourage people carelessly infecting us other. make jokes Darwinism antivaxxers floor, none us actually wants visitors get sick. will, large numbers. It‚Äôs inevitable given current local covid rates, vaccination rates age, governor lifting nearly restrictions could enforce today.

Additionally, bats typically low level ebolavirus-associated antibodies, seropositivity bats strongly correlated human Copy pasta I'm lazy.

I think concern people vaccinated may asymptomatic presymptomatic carriers. Hell, still can't find source says vaccinated people can't spread covid happen pick up.

Children (among others) still can't get vaccinated. 13 month old baby can't wear mask. I'm still stuck home kid protection thing.

If fully vaccinated want wear mask, that's great. please ignore sideways glances way know sure can't spread disease kids. agree. ready yet getting close. stopped wearing mask outside. fully vaccinated month. figure July heat taking mask good come winter might wear again. It‚Äôs nice face warmer  Maybe, maybe not, still effective enough concern.  works you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre going catch disease. vax‚Äôd you‚Äôre going get ill.

Basically anti-vaccine crowd taking huge risk shopping TJs. still happen last week. 34 percent Americans vaccinated. Where‚Äôs 68?? epidemiologists CDC Depends are; California NYC, probably former. Deep South, probably flips latter. Literally saving lives continuing wear mask indoors. That‚Äôs is. overly emotional nonsense. far left right horseshoe. It‚Äôs almost funny. would 100% happy needed show proof door. mixed feelings know ton antivax people work using opportunity stop wearing masks entirely. symptoms start kick in? Like long got shot? read article? That‚Äôs good news. Basically says small businesses people weakened immune nervous handle dealing obvious jerks coming bad news? fine. great news vaccines safe effective. 

There mechanism genetic issue happen good there.  lot misinformation changing genes, definitely true. 

Even young, vaccine much much lower risk contracting covid. Additionally help protect friends, family, others community can't yet get vaccine, like children well adults might full response vaccine due immune system problems. Even US doubles 0.2 0.4 per day teens, Canada going like 1+ percent per day accelerating due additional supply, catching 0.6 percent day. 

US currently sitting 46.8, Canada 43. Canadian catchup rate maintains 0.6 percent day, it'll overtake week (6.3 days) fearing Wal-Mart

Boo! 6/7 asymptomatic 1 mild symptoms.

You guessed right :D  exact boat you. It‚Äôs really unclear do. here. muscle pain lying bed fetal position twitching chills 38C fever.

Your country may masks Singapore consistent masking outdoors well(though point comment). point expectations vaccinations.  Yes get pass old father like last week numbers wrong. IFR age group closer .001%

I‚Äôd interested scholarly source suggests individuals vaccinated covid spread coronavirus, please. know top Epidemiologist reddit! know non mask wearers vaccinated? Source?  certainly wish best, reality well vaccines work, likely experience symptoms probably even known routine testing. Part infection, notably asymptomatic infection, far drastically decreased, we‚Äôre confident that‚Äôs enough transmission. Even like, breakthrough infections resulted transmission, would still pretty decent vaccine. we‚Äôve also seen viral loads present breakthrough infections also highly reduced, transmission even lower Good luck dealing people lying vaccination fake cards. Who‚Äôs implying mask social distance forever? Obviously countries get vaccinated, we‚Äôre rush. like said I‚Äôm also sure you‚Äôre getting notion wear masks still. Let guess worked 100x harder health officials said 28 airport workers became infected, 19 fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccines, two approved use Singapore.

19* vaccinated 9. correct. think woods yet trusting people vaxed keep mask crazy. Biden made big deal national mask policy 5 months ok take off. interesting happens next. Except steep downward trajectory instead holding firm increasing like September. Think type. Pessimism intellect. Giuliani fucking pr campaign idiots fell for. 90% country parroting he's America's mayor even stepped foot new York tells everything need fucking know Americans told stupid fucking opinions.

He working Russians fucking idiots, entire fucking time. Cleaning new York meant fucking Italians Russian fucking mob. got played. understanding six seven infections indeed asymptomatic infections

Sounds like vaccines work wonderfully then. regularly tested they'd never felt need get test.  Dear lord, humanity risk. risk death people 55 1%. pandemic. didn‚Äôt change aspect American culture. Why? you‚Äôre vaxxed nothing worry about. you‚Äôre not, get sick, that‚Äôs you. people continue exercise personal caution like pandemic.  ""endemics go away"" world experienced record low seasonal influenza scientists already discovered weapon eliminate plasmodium (malaria causing organism). Disease go away could. I'm vaccinated unafraid go maskless though get wrong. way, customers clean carts! 

I'll probably mask crowded places awhile longer. mean... culture countries mask you‚Äôre sick don‚Äôt spread shit.

So, kinda? People criticizing Walmart, Amazon, Facebook, many big corporations still using/buying services big hypocrites. Protest top 1% owns pretty much everything choosing smaller brands small businesses. Regardless.of CEO, shop Kroger/Fred Meyer anymore service staff gone way downhill. obvious take care people nobody wants work there. familiar friendly faces gone, got never saw staff twice. 

Oh, deli went shit. good food replaced boars head corporate labeled crap. TIL work Kroger. biochem rusty believe described COVID hijacking cells DNA getting replicate portion viral DNA essentially encoded new cell (I may wrong though)

However, vaccines use dead covid virus, mechanism would occur via vaccines. amount free beer donuts going convince someone get vaccine believe vaccine full mercury microchips whatever, they'll see incentives small price pay Bill Gates inject mind control serum you. Arguing anti-vaxxers giving headache good reason. 

Everyone else needs shots available possible. ended make 40 minute drive get mine, someone else lives might able same. thinking dumb fuck. Lmao It'd incredibly rare someone fully vaccinated get covid able transmit someone else, even extremely rare scenario happens kid gets Covid he'll almost surely asymptomatic maybe light headace. Yikes, even 1 death many. Scratch one list Hi Mr - Ms cashier Ive vaccinated wink wink. pay gluten free, Non GMO Hagen Daz ice cream lol.  ready August, school starts yeah get that. hand weird see much confidence reduced asymptomatic transmission without proper control. anecdotally totally agree, statistics class would solid F mRNA vaccines target specific part spike protein allows cell entry. 

If mutates significantly, virus work. can't open deadbolt lock wrong key.

Old flu vaccines target whole virus.

It's like dropping dumb bombs race car, mRNA vaccines laser guided munition. since probably anti mask anyway. Masks basically ended today That's cool, guess?

I'm fully vaxxed trust fellow citizens enough demask public yet.

No thanks. Yes Yea, live Cali absolutely hate lifting restrictions. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated don‚Äôt trust people around know inconsiderate people play others lives understand trusting CDC considering response. reaction backlash 1976 Swine Flu impacted approach large vaccination efforts CDC messages guidelines makes suggestions. Hopefully bit reset CDC seem top situation seemed like could easily swayed change message. cautious 1976 Swine Flu, good explaining cautious making official announcements taking stance. think it‚Äôs selfish easy things, includes getting vaccine supply overtaking demand areas.

For me, continuing wear mask vaccinated acknowledgement one knows I‚Äôm telling truth. feel better, though won‚Äôt much pandemic shown people self-aware. knew there, numbers higher estimated. I‚Äôm sure helped public service component job getting vaccine way give protection TPTB wouldn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt back.  Get vaccinated lose mask. Anyone can't, managed every flu season. Anyone won't, care about. Simple. know sure things play everything reopens. 

So far, US still mask mandates, people working home, school closures, etc. CDC reported almost 1,000 hospitalizations fully vaccinated people hundreds deaths. based numbers reported CDC, could higher due lack testing fully vaccinated people potentially unexplained deaths may due California 

""California reported 3,620 so-called breakthrough cases coronavirus infections people fully vaccinated since Jan. 1, state public health officials said Wednesday. cases, least 150 people hospitalized least 20 died.""

So yes, rare. say impossible. Especially given people immunosuppressants weak immune systems; may need take extra precautions case vaccine less effective them. know pretty stupid. could also see ploy promote vaccine. Similar China initially recognising vaccine order visit China.

Let us hope practical pragmatic. isn‚Äôt cdc advice all. still recommend people without vaccine wear masks indoors. insane  Yikes. higher chance getting hit bus choking dinner getting serious illness COVID passing someone else *fully vaccinated.*

This never guaranteeing anyone‚Äôs certain wellbeing. RISK MANAGEMENT overloading healthcare system.

And we‚Äôre that. mean. makes? like ya go things people could waiting for: case numbers react everyone decides return normal, effective vaccines India variant new variants, maybe need time break mask wearing habits. would say ‚Äúyeah wait GOP supporter reads tells everyone 5G too‚Äù üòÇ realised don‚Äôt read statistically highly unlikely made far comments fat-fingering phone, there‚Äôs chance thankfully Nobody listen insane person. people tell single night sleeping dry irritated eyes get. I‚Äôve 15 years. get eyeball touch thing you‚Äôre good. thing glasses better fashion statement Yes possibility end time, still could waited greater number people vaccinated people (children) eligible.

Here's specific dilemma: brother getting married next weekend. Originally scheduled spring 2020 postponed obvious reasons. venue supposed outdoors.

Now mask rules lifted, venue moved inside. three children eligible vaccine. even old enough... literally opened got shot day 1 immune time... mask guidance lifted immediately.

So indoors group extended friends family know. bet wearing masks regardless vaccinated sufficient time not. 

This effectively increases kids' risk event, days ago lower risk.

No, think need wait forever get back normal seems like little quick jump. Sorry late response. data efficacy Moderna vaccine variants, would grateful. Capitalism explicitly vertical hierarchy system, like dictatorship, monarchy, oligarchy. democratic, attempts democratize move towards Socialism *away* Capitalism. could also explained 12-15 year old beeing allowed vaccinate.  check everyone comes door. stupid short sited read KOAT, mask requirement ended. saying applies ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù individuals idea verified. 

The exception Hospitals, DrOffices ect jails public transportation it‚Äôs safe say 61,000 might acceptable Covid US. 

With caveat covid hospitalizations burden longer. 

What 120,000? 180,000? level would people accept mitigation strategies covid seasons? Surely point wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù, would bit more.  know much buy 1st generation vaccine prevents severe illness death many variants point. feel like boosters thing, think really know annually necessary yet. Legit lol. way true. Exactly. Plus, testing figures way out. huge portion population probably antibodies infection.  I‚Äôd rather place still requires mask mandate.

Barely noticed mask. great time. resistance people accepting things going return normal surprising me. 

I surprised learn people knew anti masks I‚Äôm surprised learn people know going keep wearing masks ‚Äúuntil covid thing over‚Äù. 

Endemics don‚Äôt go away can't get AZ US.... not? Good you, wish states still going like anyone know fully vaccinated? Obviously person knows that's it. honor system non-mask wearing. suppose fully vaccinated fairly safe pretend wearing mask.

I'm getting back ""normal"" seems like nonsense. policy masks required masks required. realize ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù also lie say vaccinated even not. know people anti maskers people didn‚Äôt get vaccine totally take masks screw people actually sort common sense Walmart going enforce mask wearing unvaccinated customers ?

So one making moment, seems people hesitate want force it. People aren‚Äôt vaccinated would ignore mask requirements wouldn‚Äôt wearing masks begin with. going fuck us. Non vaxed people aren‚Äôt going wear masks Bit waste really unless huge stock. isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs causing cases minimally rise areas. That‚Äôs it. Anything else hear hyperbole manufacture consent another lockdown. actually mean thing, since nobody able verify Far it. frequently challenged ideas presented sources backing claims. change mind times saw others same. full people know science slapped face telling know I'm talking about. convince turd comes along claiming want echo chamber. I‚Äôm sicker right allergies guys probably COVID thanks vaccines. point don‚Äôt get sick anyway, sucks isn‚Äôt they‚Äôre taking away incident.  number case worldwide traced routine outdoor activities negligible, includes places crowded cities. surprise watching Fukushima.  Right. chance getting struck lightning ending fatal car accident. 

I work local grocery store. I‚Äôm curious see ownership lift masking requirement not. Don‚Äôt care anymore I‚Äôm vaccinated retuning normal life aside wear mask work. know people use excuse get vaccinated even though breakthrough cases bound happen. 

Without vaccines least one could‚Äôve ended severe Covid hospital. Kroger employs 465,000 people. Let's say CEO turned distributed employees. That's around $40 month.

Sure every little bit helps, like reason workers underpaid. pay whatever like, really affect hourly employees. I‚Äôm hoping Meijer does, too. hate wearing mask work. breakthrough infections reason getting vaccinated, even though breakthrough infections small number cases. 

You‚Äôd think cared small number breakthrough infections that, know, would‚Äôve cared virus that‚Äôs killed 600k people. Spot  pandemic over.

Crazy, true. Americans socially done virus, better worse CDC fueled disillusion recent weeks/days. going really weird watching Asia get rattled remain relatively OK (assuming super variants arise) Yeah that's point....they listen said things different rural areas anti-science, NY listening CDC guidance less anti-science? thats stupid though. Surely can't ignore people access vaccines cares. unvaccinated get dangerously sick anyways. vaccine won‚Äôt even know get covid also unlikely. 

Only people risk unvaxed  We‚Äôre risk 40% don‚Äôt get vaccinated, keep spreading virus increasing chance variant resistant vaccines.  Infection mediated immunity isn‚Äôt *quite* good vaccine mediated immunity. think ‚ÄúHow many doses need you‚Äôve it?‚Äù question still open, (I‚Äôm betting one plenty.) getting least one dose still recommended recovered individuals. 

At population level, infection mediated immunity contribute herd immunity, person, shot would still good idea drop mask. Papa Nurgle loves us lot cooperation Chinese government SARS?  there's nothing could possibly would make fewer people die COVID. 

Absolutely nothing. 

Right? ""this way pass buck, pass buck, pass buck, pass buck responsible""   Well bad, like mask.   understand say true things leave people incorrect beliefs.

What difficult concept avoiding that?

If tell people rules wearing masks, hear 'there rules anymore,' what's difference lying omission shitty job communicating facts, besides intent? One things maintaining ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù state people fail realize it‚Äôs temporary. long term mass vaccination way out. Taiwan gold standard pandemic management( close zero cases without strict lockdowns society 90-95% normal)
However shows even rush vaccinations risk larger outbreaks/ getting left behind. Ugh, wish could hold onto weeks Lucky already autism üí™üí™üí™ babies :( vaccines year ago, now. can't understand difference makes, I'm afraid got lot learning do. distract recent negative news right absolutely make sense science, might made people really nervous feel secure phasing masking out, saving lot friction announcement caused. 

Personally, I'm fine even went store unmasked today know science says safe. lol orange county places never locked down/required masks. state care enforce it. Maybe SF will. Walmart's lifted it, suggest vulnerable populations get groceries go jobs going libertarian safety measures? 3 million immunocompromised people lot cancer organ transplant patients. supposed rights/protections protect ego terrible injustice wear mask grocery store. Exactly. Also I‚Äôm woman guy either way! :D
Also argument (which I‚Äôve also seeing lot) it‚Äôs going hard susceptible people distinguish lying vaccinated not, therefore everyone wear mask. Might dumbest argument I‚Äôve heard. Anti maskers haven‚Äôt wearing one whole time, VACCINATED people wear mask make others feel better UNVACCINATED people aren‚Äôt??  solution CDC make recommendations like daily cases higher Joe Biden campaign trail advocating national mask mandates. 

Or Vaccine passports formal identification show fully vaccinated board directors approved this. Expose all. vaccine cards keep 90% people honest people get seriously sick unvaccinated. say vaccinated likely hospitalized exposure. 

If vaccinated exposed least likely hospitalized. 

People lying vaccinated hurting themselves. It‚Äôs one else wearing mask protecting anti maskers before. shield people made wearing masks lifted anti maskers top pile money, many beautiful ladies. I'd guess ""some"" people refused wear masks Jan, Feb, March 2020 referred CDC saying (in March 2020) wear one Polls show 30% parents willing let child get vaccine US might make big impact think. least got hazard pay, get anything working pandemic. didn‚Äôt write $22.4MM check right after. real quote got 6% raise. Yeah moron could CEO given chance, job consists precisely fuck occasional dick squat. reason ‚Äúrare‚Äù many companies CEO jobs go slightly less wealthy friends insanely wealthy business owners private equity firm investors. legally allowed collect information though? thought HIPPA prohibited employers collecting health related info Polls show there's large cross-section unvaxxed people plan get point felt compelled get done. 

This could push finally compels Ok whats point cdc saying vaccinated then? think get rid restrictions despite cdc says?? They‚Äôre fighting overly cautious safe. somehow bc like social stance believed masks not. hardcore pro maskers feeling like wearing one shows they‚Äôre right side Exactly. CDC lost credibility since mask fiaco this. think cure wages unionize? Unions outlived usage. unions fng joke literally zip help members. stop shit. 

 Tax rich something get with. *sous vide rich* Without proof vaccination, people lie. reliant honor system stupid expect CDC? slipping mask shopping heavy restriction? get relaxing enforcement concerts social things immunosuppressed avoid regardless essentials make sense. Hey man better late never. Glad u able get vaccine eating steak that‚Äôs fully cooked risks. alcoholic drink risks. Stepping outside polluted city risks. unmasked vaccinated risks. They‚Äôre tiny. you‚Äôre concerned mask double mask. 95% effective mask top 95% effective vaccine make feel safe shouldn‚Äôt care people unmasked point. level safety enough you? There's large section people fence need one little push. CDC giving greenlight go maskless fully vaccinated could need get people. I‚Äôm 3 hrs north Minneapolis city rural.

Thanks, I'll stop wearing seatbelts condoms long it‚Äôs property getting really tired ,America? you‚Äôre vaccinated, caught covid passed vaccinated father? Gross. Don‚Äôt shop Kroger. could said ""when community reached x% vaccinated mandate dropped"" Source? know right? people supported science behind masks social distance rules going science?

I get TBH. explains efficacy calculated. key quote ""Simple mathematics helps. vaccinated population 100 000 protected 95% them, would leave 5000 individuals diseased 3 months, almost current overall COVID-19 case rate UK. Rather, 95% vaccine efficacy means instead 1000 COVID-19 cases population 100 000 without vaccine (from placebo arm abovementioned trials, approximately 1% would ill COVID-19 99% would not) would expect 50 cases (99¬∑95% population disease-free, least 3 months)."".

This really change anything. vaccines still completely effective.

The crash helmet analogy really work either, still lot precautions take driving. may strap helmets ourselves, wear seatbelts. Why? something easy significantly increases safety. wearing masks vaccinated. CDC telling us wear masks mask supply would run medical professionals. Let's pretend based science. today announced. hard keep wearing mask knowing tomorrow would free all. I‚Äôm sure probably could.

Only looked news articles though. 300 per day still die. wearing mask literally everywhere rest life.

But small sacrifice could wear mask cases ~1000 US (probably &lt;1 month imho) per day. Feels good see life return normal. Hopefully course action doesn‚Äôt spike cases . Nobody's forcing nurses, doctors etc. go anywhere. decide (our governments could offer decent pay help countries, course). military's job go government wants go, government wants do. could actually go countries help citizens instead killing country's soldiers. soldiers might actually prefer kind job instead risking lives killing soldiers!

Taiwan raised coronavirus alert level Saturday capital, Taipei, surrounding city, bringing curbs period two weeks shut many venues restrict gatherings wake 180 new domestic infections.

Masks worn outdoors first time, government encourages work study home, shutting cinemas entertainment spots, limiting gatherings families friends five indoors 10 outdoors.

Taipei‚Äôs government already¬†ordered bars, nightclubs similar venues shut.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said ""level risk"" certain hot spots, Taipei's gritty Wanhua district, spurred decision raise alert level.

""Only infections dealt controlled,"" told reporters.

Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je urged people stay home much possible, adding schools teaching move online.

""During time, nothing on, stay home go out, do, wear mask reduce infection droplets,"" said Ko, doctor training.

President Tsai Ing-wen's spokesman said would reduce number ""unnecessary meetings"" public events. presidential office close Wanhua.

Amid pictures social media showed people flocking supermarkets stock toilet paper instant noodles, economy ministry took Facebook assure people supplies ample need hoard.

The rising community infections unnerved stock market¬†(.TWII)¬†this week, though government says island's economic fundamentals remain good.

Deputy Finance Minister Frank Juan told Reuters authorities would watch market reaction Monday, adding rule calling meeting National Stabilisation Fund, government use smooth large fluctuations.

Investors act rationally, said, pointing sectors would affected curbs, tourism, rather island's crucial foreign trade.

The new restrictions apply chip-manufacturing hub Hsinchu, unlikely affect exports semiconductors, global shortage shut car factories.

Chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd¬†(2330.TW), said closely monitoring situation, cutting non-essential gatherings activities reducing movement people across different chip fabs.

Taiwan millions vaccine doses order Moderna Inc¬†(MRNA.O)¬†and AstraZeneca Plc¬†(AZN.L), though small number arrived latter due global shortages vaccination rates remain low.

More vaccines start arriving next month, Tsai said.

Since pandemic began, Taiwan reported fewer 1,500 cases among population 24 million, imported abroad, recent rise community transmissions spooked residents.

The island never gone full lockdown people used life carrying near normal, despite pandemic ranging many parts world. It‚Äôll never truly gone. hides animals effectively gone, people still got it. need one case transmit one person someone else, whole covid pandemic started 1 case. 

The way say polio gone, stopped vaccinating would eventually come back since it‚Äôs still around somewhere world (Afghanistan) COVID god-sent. gods mean. He's saying goal NJ 4.7 million fully vaxxed. confirmed hitting means dropping mandate though. We're looking what, 30-40% eligible population getting vaccinated?

I assure less 1% people saw stores last year mask out. whole ""anti-vaxxers wearing masks anyway"" argument really hold water. Maskless people likely also anti-vax, anti-vax mean wearing mask told so.  Here‚Äôs article start rabbit hole you. Stopping people getting seriously ill turns grim reaper kid wearing grim reaper costume. numbers mixed - annual risk death ones lifetime via shark attack 1 3.7 million. Although that‚Äôs chance dying, overall chance shark attack. one six deadly (over last fifty years), odds shark attack (but necessarily death) somewhere ballpark 1 500k Cries Cuomo audience comprised rational adults

Lol Full disclaimer zero science/medical background, lot non fear mongering Twitter folks like Monica Ghandi Eric Topol pointing lot PCR positives asymptomatic, vaccinated people associated viral loads small transmission impossible. says flu one it‚Äôs likely undercount, since COVID way universally tested, seems feasible. Covid one says 0 .03 % children die virus, I‚Äôve seen .01 % child mortality rate flu. Meaning, similar rates. 

I also remember seeing risk compared flu table huge dataset goes age. 12-18 think it‚Äôs bit higher, 0-5 it‚Äôs less flu. saying child deaths bit misleading due 12-18 able vaccinate. 0-12 unable vaccinate, whose bodies literally produce antibodies shot (already happened one family members autoimmune disease). count guess. cremate without death certificate? I‚Äôm same‚Ä¶14months later It‚Äôs really fair compare one year flu novel virus. novel virus takes weakest first, it‚Äôs effects wane. flu already taken people susceptible flu past years. 

Also doesn‚Äôt consider many exposed - especially effects masks. flu vaccine many people get. 

We won‚Äôt really able accurately compare two diseases years. feeling 188 306 order magnitude. another point comparison - 636 children aged 12 younger died motor vehicle crashes 2018. got J&amp;j vaccine would really, really like see real world data j&amp;j rather yet another study great Pfizer is. Particularly longer term - vaccine actually get better two months like initially suggested? Cus right serious vaccine envy. I'm glad mRNA vaccines work well tremendously reduced risk us, folks j&amp;j acting like fully vaccinated partially? I'd get second shot Pfizer heartbeat could get clear guidance. post super ignorant frankly embarrassing That's still low level testing relative countries red list, 20% great. Cases probably rise week well. think green list actually, red list countries science-driven imo. actually think people continue wear masks every winter? keep seeing people twitter saying continue mask every winter avoid flu, honestly dont think going it, like 5 years, doubt wearing mask winter. scary part going wipe away million people end summer. scary part going suffocate enough high flow oxygen. ‚ÄòSafe say‚Äô maybe, sure ‚Äòsafely‚Äô It‚Äôs catch-22. didn‚Äôt lift masking vaccinated you‚Äôd hear people say (and saying) ‚Äúwhy get vaccine can‚Äôt return normal‚Äù lift masking can‚Äôt discern vaccinated essentially you‚Äôre giving unvaccinated free-pass avoid getting it. don‚Äôt think take years. Israel get couple weeks. Maybe small flare ups time time, locally plenty places Israel zero cases. 

I‚Äôm sure virus stay around high numbers. think goal treat virus like measles rather flu. tremendously safe effective vaccines help us. Holy shit! actually makes sense! knew something fishy Bill Gates actually questionable intentions!
(This also joke.) Welp, guess Murphy longer claim New Jersey ""follows science."" going get absolutely dunked come November. said U.S. shipped pfizer though - happened, would like happen. U.S. probably close 100 million doses mRNA vaccine, think they'll handing soon Wut 5G miCRochiPs? kids killed parents year US died Covid since pandemic began, I've seen several times stores area employees ask people put mask on. (Trader Joe's, aldi, Publix) IL governor stated Thursday would changing executive order regarding masks match CDC guidelines, don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs done yet. Six months last week. Additional six months Except look value gained, larger amount population immunity valuable smaller amount slightly higher immunity Actually 57% Sinopharm 43% AstraZeneca. data breakdown breakthrough cases. words, idiocy fueled idiotic ideals. Breaking news. Sorry I‚Äôm dummy missed article, apply states? 0.009% ""far below"" 0.01% Canada lower level vaccine hesitancy U.S. many polls highlight this, U.S. 60% people willing get vaccinated, Canada 80%.

We currently 45% first dose. 

Maybe also help different appetite vaccines U.S. thought CDC lax entire time. could stomped like countries giving everyone enough pay stay home month locking hard. Australia New Zealand, lots southeast Asian countries made work. 

I following science various studies say thing still airborne, low percentage fully vaccinated people, kids still deserve collective protection. 

I‚Äôm gonna whine moan others get go mask want, worries we‚Äôre premature. state, MA, fine since high percentage vaccinations. rest country? sure. Starting Saturday, Marylanders longer need wear masks prevent spread coronavirus settings, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Friday Masks still required public transportation schools, airports, day care centers health care facilities, hospitals doctors‚Äô offices. Local governments individual businesses opt keep mask requirements local officials elsewhere quickly signaled would follow Hogan‚Äôs lead dropping mask requirements, including Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford Howard end broad mask mandate applies Marylanders, whether vaccinated not, everywhere aren‚Äôt tighter local rules place. However, Republican governor said strongly encourages anyone age 2 older vaccinated continue wearing mask indoors, well outdoors can‚Äôt keep physically distanced others. want stop think said. two levels.

First claim kids died Covid 'many people got flu' Covid. Read times to, makes zero sense.

Then I'll point original claim Covid less deadly flu kids. COVID causing higher body count, statement hold water. may lower mortality rate, makes higher infectiousness.

I know exactly kind science means, thanks, COVID still kills kids. practical terms, that's matters. don‚Äôt mind wearing pop store whatever mind wearing working active job day. Tired sweaty face hard(er) time communicating coworkers customers. Try tool. luck family. Important remember reason concern, though. UK advanced vaccination program far government *terrified* thing significantly increased transmission taken root.

And majority people world live countries vaccines going right now.

The fact appear significant degree immune escape wonderful news future continued ability defeat covid, possibility increased spread big problem world right now. vaccinated, risk still high enough cost mask wearing low enough that, statistically, still wear mask. There's much bigger chance catching COVID vaccinated getting car accident.

That's *absolutely* false. chance dying car crash 1 100, many many people get car accidents survive. Breakthrough infections fully vaccinated people 0.1% chance less never goal. would take years. we're going zero cases also going zero cases flu viral diseases. Viruses constantly mutate, we‚Äôre interested variants concern. sound like top virologist. Wish led you.

/s Nothing. point must self accountability. Get vaccine. CDC says largely safe severe effects COVID. Don‚Äôt get vaccine taking chance COVID. idea vaccines never stamp COVID. coming way limit effects. That‚Äôs achieved. ‚ÄúWalmart stop putting ‚ÄòMask Required‚Äô signs outside stores enforcing anything signs say ‚ÄòMasks Required Vaccinated Customers Only‚Äô continuing give fuck either way‚Äù

FTFY 

All they‚Äôre changing useless sign outside different useless sign outside. know can't leave baby home alone right? single parent, one watching baby, go anything. Groceries, example, stuck taking kid you.

If grocery store full people without masks, including unvaccinated anti-mask types happily abusing new freedom go unmasked, kids going get exposed, sick, die. problem B.1.617.1 B.1.617.2. variant likely become dominant Europe next months since seems transmissible UK variant. possible 50% transmissible, could lead R 9. vaccines likely work it, rate transmission cause huge hospitalisation rates unvaccinated, inevitable mean lot vaccinated people still get severe symptoms since vaccines perfect. could big problem. 84% 65+ year olds gotten least 1 shot. really impressive! Indian cell goons. Pretty standard stuff people addicted ideal maintaining 'image'. legit concern. still wear masks indoors bit longer. last months, weeks least lol obsessed Tedros. saying criticizing silent.  one people infected player.

And, blunt, 96. could easily died falling chair. legitimately trouble breathing actual mask extended periods. mild asthma horrible allergies. get full mucus quick allergy season it‚Äôs awful.

When science said wear masks sucked wore them. I‚Äôve fully vaccinated kept wearing one. 

Now science says aren‚Äôt vitally important I‚Äôm done. won‚Äôt shopping large stores still require masks. It‚Äôs political vindictive. I‚Äôm fine people aren‚Äôt ready let masks go. don‚Äôt want feel like shit I‚Äôm buying groceries.  Totally. don‚Äôt get it. only.

But that‚Äôs works.

And need break. would help end pandemic. Masks mandates would removed sooner later. people think long-term? Oh, vaccine doesn‚Äôt actually benefit RIGHT going get it. Really people? NY, NJ, CT tied together geographically economically. makes sense governors work together. I'd say pretty safe. covid. antibodies. Even without vaccine. know four vaccinated people got virus even good mask wearing Presenting exhaustive list 5,000 variants, scientists said variants - like E484K mutation N501Y mutation - higher transmission rate.
""However, apparent low prevalence might simply enough sequencing done. coronavirus genomes need sequenced across country accurately identify emergence new variants,"" said Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB corresponding author study. glossing lower risk part, really fit narrative. 

The fact lower risk, transmission kind significant sickness. low enough fact able attend school, packed classroom 30 people 6 hours day. Compared this, trip grocery store wear mask really nothing. 

Beyond that, **yes** parent's responsibility take additional precautions wish. That's part package deal child. Neither I.

Look another example. strict laws kids, especially smaller ones, riding car seats boosters passed rigorous safety standards. good thing, safety standards save lives cars much safer kids growing sitting front seat air bag. thousands kids still die every year car accidents. could get number closer zero making regulations even stricter, perhaps even prohibiting children riding high risk vehicles like personally owned cars, don‚Äôt point made choice level risk acceptable despite greater zero.

black% vaccine: 61%

GOP: 56%

the point article seems warranted Pewresearch. get protective masks easily now. KN95 first shot mRNA vaccine gives basically zero risk even around unvaccinated, unmasked people. vaccinated? Yes.

Uh would ZERO cases unless variants take hold efficacy vaccines goes way down. agree masking stop reaching 100%, question lift mask requirements? 90% vaccinated? 80? 70? threshold?

I can't say exactly perhaps base vaccination rates, base community spread. moment community spread covid US....certainly parts US...is relatively high. high higher several months last 1.5 year pandemic risk continues high **unvaccinated**. needed wearing masks need wearing now. data based approach look trend, trend continues current trajectory, CDC probably correct decision. trend shifts back though, could argue messed lifted mask requirements soon.

Well point would late it? think even CDC would say data already says unvaccinated wear masks right now. problem is....now won't. saying wrong mean much.

Well course mean much....I'm commenter reddit. However people die this, 100% certain. unvaccinated without masks together public places. Surely lead deaths masks could prevented. vaccines great though....so share hope numbers continue go anyway. people numbers....there actual lives lost policy change. threshold removing mask requirements impact downward trend infections. CDC thinks reached threshold enough immunity country. personally think correct.

But again, CDC removed masks everybody said vaccinated may remove masks. RESULT Walmart public places EFFECTIVELY removing masks everybody. Therefore CDC may goofed here....or trying offer carrot unvaccinated backfire realize unvaccinated get eat carrot without getting vaccinated. far Democrats go black people way pro vaccine list goes though. VA drops distancing rules May 28 I'm saying straw man, that's exactly is. 

Smoking tobacco HIGH-RISK ACTIVITY. causes addition, illness, death people participate it. Adults legally able make choice accept risks wish, children not. 

COVID exposure HIGH-RISK profile children. cause illness, serious complications death VAST majority children exposed it. 

See difference there? way whatsoever. Philly. change mask guidance supposed encourage vaccinations.

The reasoning behind described.

The way could see motivating vaccinations unvaccinated start getting sick mingling maskless. Israel doesn‚Äôt 100% vaccination, rate cases still falling. Natural infection produce immunity, high risk people already vaccinated. 

At point, likely already path israel‚Ä¶ month behind. 

If CDC guidance recommended massive nationwide orgy, likely would short term spike cases, cases accelerating drop towards negligible (close zero, likely background noise forever). 

The CDC issued guidance data showed benefit restricting activities. Same, booked shit back February, knew timeline would hold idiots went got shots Blind faith CDC exclusion actual scientific evidence *is* anti-science. They've wrong times many us right whether masks would help, whether virus airborne, many things. Seeing quick Vegas dropped restrictions casinos immediately following suit I‚Äôll bet can‚Äôt wait open clubs ASAP advertise covid protocols. It‚Äôs really straw man also seeing pattern rather actually trying defend position cling ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs straw man‚Äù. laws U.S. specifically minors, tobacco prime example. Why? allow adults buy tobacco children? don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs parents personal responsibility make sure kids aren‚Äôt buying tobacco? society decided it‚Äôs responsibility whole protect children beyond parents capable of. excited! trip planned beginning September I‚Äôm guessing won‚Äôt mask mandates then. child going interacting maskless adults know? I'd probably wager places optional (restaurant, movies, stores, etc.), easy either mask frequent places they're vaccinated. Cultural group think maybe? Better wrong together right yourself. sure applies vaccines though. really need study show near sick people makes less likely get sick?  ""with 80 percent accuracy""....

I guess that's better random. Also Hudson Valley fully vaxxed waiting update. I'm CT go places pretty frequently NY draws I'll shift errands often.  Variations original comment get posted (and highly upvoted) often bookmarked poll respond.

It‚Äôs frustrating. does, hoping loosen lockdown slightly people getting vaccinated wearing masks. Try things like zoo, guess not. know that‚Äôs outside, long aren‚Äôt crowds outside fine, zoo gets pretty packed. can‚Äôt expect people going distancing themselves. Yes continue wear masks, it‚Äôs lot safer everyone wearing. wish could made Fall whenever kids could get vaccinated. world forcing majority something unnecessary small subset minority might take advantage it? 

Exactly this! State local mandates supersede Walmart‚Äôs policy. CDC update guidelines children &lt; 12 years old? supposed keep using masks they're vaccinated yet? exempted Covid little risk?

I know consensus bother. I'm curious actual guidelines say. anyone tell works state local mandates? 

Are able go without states drop mandate? SARS mers never worldwide pandemics scale covid. Ebola effects humans, tend show severe symptoms infectious. Smallpox animal reservoirs, eliminated humans wiped out. 

Covid exists everywhere earth. spread asymptomatic people. spread human animal. spread animal humans. multiple animal reservoirs including cats, seagulls, bats, minks. 

It‚Äôs possible covid burn out, sometimes viruses do‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs equally possible ongoing risk forever. 

Look bubonic plague clear comparison. one point nearly wiped humanity. Today it‚Äôs rare humans, zero. many animal reservoirs around world. average 9 cases per year USA. offering workers sacrificial lambs like decent capitalist country, duh. Exactly. Flu levels low year places mask don‚Äôt alike. Definitely lot lack international travel. Also, could fully vaccinated infected rate probably higher 1.9% breakthrough infections asymptomatic mild? Vaccinated people testing much work experience symptoms. really need look Disney Universal history lol. Heck, look Hollywood Studios World explicitly said they‚Äôre that. Right. going act public waving around fake vaccination exemption cards? Nobody cares LOL Great, that's strawman. Tobacco high-risk product everyone, including children. 

COVID exposure particularly high-risk profile children, parents want keep children exposed, plenty ways without wide-ranging public health measures placed EVERYONE. 

Personal responsibility. Get it. surprised if, Monday, Murphy Cuomo get stage front statue liberty jerk announcing end restrictions. CT ending everything Wednesday, New York New jersey need follow soon. want big presser time plan something Friday. That's everyone Sure gets back original point made is, murdering children pointed small risk numbers. still don‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh well‚Äù, pretty harsh laws people that. entire point. proper meaningful comparison would something like:

The probability *getting* Covid-19, multiplied probability dying get it.

vs.

The probability getting rare blood clot vaccination, multiplied probability dying get it.

The headline bit muddle, comparing risk dying get Covid-19 risk *getting* blood clot, without reference risk death clot. know people get notion Asian countries mask time. wear mask pollution higher normal maaaybe feeling well venture public. thats obviously good idea wish Americans would same, even close masks mandated 100 percent time. Please shoot messenger. Hudson Valley, too. Hello, neighbor! Thinking Cuomo may ditch indoor masks state soon keep city time being. year now, I've even worn masks using drive thru, morning first morning wear one getting breakfast. another super spreader summer antivaxx people finally able party like wanna Everyone wears masks stores required look around see everyone else mask on. percentage hardcore anti maskers pretty low. we're getting rid universal masking requirement pressure longer going there. We‚Äôve done before. babies man, suck. politics, lot it. President France openly claiming vaccine work, tell need know absurd petty geopolitical motivations behind attempts undermine vaccine. I‚Äôm parent unvaccinated child. She‚Äôs dining yet, she‚Äôs wearing KN-95 mask. risk incredibly low, we‚Äôve taken appropriate precautions. qualms lifting mask restrictions everyone else, family mask restriction remains place (to extreme joy 14-year-old, assure you). seriously interested company require proof vaccination vaccination without violating HIPAA (One P can't spell correctly) sounds like case waiting go Supreme Court.

That's HIPAA does. already gone courts ruled reason employer require people prove vaccinated. already settled. second shot got retired nurse man feel thing! knew give shot! reason avoided flu everything shut minimal contact people. mask help little? Sure. aren‚Äôt 100% effective That's old science. Masking protects well, especially wearing right masks. CDC updated guidance fall. 

...and that's great 'you fucking did,' congrats. accounts second shot, well protected point even two weeks out. significant efficacy measured week FIRST shot, even complete quite yet. 

Unfortunately narrative, CDC looked entirety data concluded rate spread, vaccination rate, hospital rates low enough time make change. 

If **you** feel like need additional protection, **you** continue wear masks take precautions protect you. 

Period, end story. might wear one I‚Äôm crowded train plane, that‚Äôs really. Absolutely support making mandatory thing bars, arenas, workplaces, places worship, etc. Fuck CEOs massive salaries. Look, massive corporation indeed need leader, 22.4 million?!? times like this?!? FUCK KROGER one requiring vaccination cards unless getting free Krispy Kreme donut Oh, okay that's different. guess they're waiting Spain catch get similar vaccination rates seems like coming weeks.

Is wearing still common indoor spaces things like shops public transport?

But also consider practically adults Gibraltar vaccinated still indoor masks. Yet 36% US. Polite Canadians ass. ruse! Many people underestimate threat Covid, especially young healthy people. They've told death negative outcome realize actual impact infection. aged like milk‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt processed NEXUS applications since border closing. backlog insane. Prior Covid 2019, took 4ish months get NEXUS card. Yeah, completely glossing fact antimaskers vaccine basically group. 

This meant incentive folks get vaccines take masks. going end people taking masks without vaccinated challenged vaccine status lie say vaccinated. many businesses going interested verifying vaccination status that's way challenge trying enforce masking enforcing masking going great. Even stores mask requirements always enforce think physical safety employees can't risk altercations.   British (not Amazon) show Utopia amazing, exact plot - fake pandemic created distribute vaccine actually sterilizes vast majority population. CDC studied this, concluded fully vaxxed people longer benefit wearing masks

Do study? thought along wearing masks protection people around mask wearer actual mask wearer. New York's vaccination rate? said reality means everyone, since businesses likely going asking people prove vaccination status, anti vaxers/anti maskers lie suck. write well. wanted say said probably would say way upsets everyone.

We can't stay pandemic mode case numbers floor enough people vaccinated. feel vulnerable scared simply going stay home whatever protect okay restrict me. I'm ready get take minuscule risk. Nearly every major supermarket big box chain curbside pickup. I've lived many different areas country, large cities small towns. Curbside pickup new thing, neither door dash, instacart, service.

Again, keep entering this? Sadly, NJ.com article states let Emergency expire Legislature passes certain ""tools flexibility"" also ""not mean end safety restrictions"". 

This worrying he's saying ""I'll drop EO code law"" that's things get messy drag years. EOs almost legal authority could last court, meaning might actually battle masks court 5 years NJ... Wal-Mart 7am morning. Ohio. Everyone mask still. 

Im vaccinated. Still used mask.  phrased like, really happening? finally safe? I'm happy! Come cats. Stay empathy. Sorry, supposed post articles politically calculated decisions validate people's gut feelings, flair ""Good News,"" get upvotes. Nobody forcing flout rules. need stop coddling science-denying anti-vaxxers. Forcing healthy danger others wear masks must stop. sends wrong messages *enabling* irrational behavior care others themselves. Instead face first #VaxxedAndProud. blame you, I'd pissed situation got second dose 3/27. hypothetical stimmy exchange vaccination retroactive ... stated first post lol.  else share help clarify point? Ah yes, side refused wear masks entire pandemic ""MY RIGHTS"" bad side prefers extra safe even getting fully vaccinated... would say eat healthy exercise. Nae vaccination mate. trust em lot Many companies finding expenses dropped WFH remote meeting, already trending 2020, continue. counter remote work see reduce opportunities advancement, especially traditionally disadvantaged groups, difficulties maintaining skill level employees turn over. hate comparison mask compliance East Asia. something *most* people do, usually sick. go see *everybody* wearing masks East Asian countries.

In fact might stretch, similar model minority myth? ""Obey East Asians they're compliant!"" Funny they're people stereotyped successful due culture something.

With said, mask usage definitely happen large scale Western nations. still wear one‚Ä¶not like banned masks. choice, freely taken knowledge covid 19 year vaccine news coming now.

The anti maskers anti vaxxers always screaming herd immunity actually bet lives make happen! 

When insist stupid things life, like playing traffic getting vaccinated pandemic, bad things happen you, go figure. Bullshit! research. Trump politicizing coronavirus didn‚Äôt help either. SIL pharmacist. said numbers shots slowing around dozen / day, 12 age group approved jumped 100 / day. Also, yesterday vaccinated ten 1st dose shots men previously hesitant. said they're late party. told never late. sarcastic, wearing mask may help allergies. miss CDC statement something? thought new guidance lifted mask recommendation fully vaccinated people. Interesting! Thanks sharing. don‚Äôt know. following MLB guidelines. guidelines could easily wrong though. never wait anything leave house enjoy life, know. haven‚Äôt looked detail‚Äîdon‚Äôt time right now‚Äîbut appears data administered vaccines (not data wants vaccine). 

There structural issues keep people, predominantly people color, want get vaccine getting it.  Cuomo kind something similar Pfizer vaccine think  22 year old female UK WFH rarely goes current case rates: statistics strongly say wait Pfizer, especially **if** hold months cover majority summer, nice weather period tend get. 

If someone cave go party moment warm enough personal risk much higher. risk death low also need consider risk long covid long term health problems one knows much yet (lung scarring etc). Indian variant takes hold spreads causing cases rise statistics affected, although case numbers would high again. 

If sensible, diligent person careful wait Pfizer, lack self discipline get AZ ASAP. I'm pretty confident UK government health experts expect cases jump 17th, question much. 

Lastly mention disinfecting yourself, covid predominantly spread via droplets/aerosolisation i.e. air. concerned better getting good quality N95/N99 FFP2/FFP3 masks, work much better protecting *you* breathing airborne covid-19. covid-19 lipid based soap water works much better disinfectant hand sanitiser (you can't easily carry sink you), risk fomites (touching stuff) much lower risk enclosed unventilated space. people wanting masks stay new CDC guidelines like train Thomas stayed tunnel afraid rain, even rain stopped. Sorry clarify traditional brown Hispanic communities. Edison primarily Indian brown typically higher access, wealth, education get vaccine. that's insane needs change. heard before. everything power cause harm another powerful choice.

Are you, really? like moral superiority comes thinking are. j j wait time 2 weeks given basically confuse people really longer wait? That‚Äôs possibly worst comparison I‚Äôve ever seen almost ended Eduardo Rodriguez's career, sure that's reason why. Well, campaign Black community whole year. literally icons community take say, ""Hey, okay."" fuckin' help Hank Aaron took died soon üòê

The GOP, hand...they like take vaccine tell constituents play virus entirely, know want happen. Well never said thought dangerous enough. thanks putting words mouth. fence nervous long term effects vaccine. Regardless decided worth worrying it. seriously need condescending. guy knows science like proper redditor groups targeted vaccine uptake go - Got second Moderna shot yesterday afternoon! Yay! experience since then: arm hurts quite bad first shot, developed headache overnight still it, pretty tired moving slow. started taking tylenol 1 a.m. drinking water. got up, ate breakfast went outside. Going outside sun helped mood! feel great will. Yeah always got store would walk deodorant shelf instantly smell scents think, molecules get mask easily..uh hello..covid?

Yeah, thank God scientists vaccines!  Since trauma logical... Translation: Businesses take first option wash hands matter like last year I'll wear one I'm sick on, also I'm crowded public place flu season. likely people remain unvaccinated trust government. easily contrast Sweden, sustained vaccination rate, high trust rate government.  CDC calculated risk policy change, determined science still supported it. Sucks suck people living northeast, voted them, live science first decisions. mixing science human behavior. CDC guidance considering former whereas politician must consider both. Guidance says VACCINATED people wear masks. order exactly follow science suggesting Cuomo end mandate install people mandatory check points upon entering indoor spaces makes sure vaccinated? proposing free thr cdc said? anyone date articles vaccines stopping spread?

All seen stuff early April CDC said walk back. went Walmart small town Georgia (while visiting family) weeks ago handing masks people them. Cornelia, Georgia. Seems reasonable enough, although see people freaking signs requiring masks non-vaccinated people.  course did, he‚Äôs idiot. counts supporters idiots. /r/Starbucks meltdown. left food service industry pandemic, still would happy mask requirements ending. think support system good reason. could become ill take care go overburdened hospital. Glad inoculated.  That‚Äôs bad thing even related that. Literally everyone getting vaccine it‚Äôs like Tuskegee   live Edison, NJ lot ‚Äúbrown‚Äù people see next vaccine hesitancy realize never going get zero masking lifted right? Anyone wants protection covid country get day week free.

I'm concerned anymore choose turn backs vaccines.

My God people India wish could flooded vaccines like US is! people choose turn noses free life saving med, that's problem, mine. part protect ungrateful asses year!

It now! state rules override stores rules. in, New York Costco still require masks state drops mandate. CDC offers recommendation states need adopt it. anyone honestly believe otherwise? expand car analogy.

As nurse, auto mechanic good cars. good people's health rather workings mechanical car components. Like mechanic's worry new system developed automobile engineers might pan out, worry rushed medical technology harm good. help heal/fix anything may go wrong, naturally disinclined change works (Don't fix ain't broke!). Changes cause adapt new conditions, learn new things, adopt new practices.

You doctor scientist developing health medical technology. Similarly, auto mechanic engineer developing new (whatever) systems automobiles. area expertise, nursing, distant mRNA vaccine development 1940s auto mechanic engineers time helping break sound barrier. Yet happened, field.

It's understandable skeptical cautious, calling ""area expertise"" incorrect. Neither field medicine automotive engineering anywhere near narrow enough accurate. seems like missed main point saying basically ""think yourself"". qualified opinion, opinion Twitter people mentioned.  know without checking vaccination cards?! It‚Äôs idiocy think everyone tell truth! That‚Äôs I‚Äôm wearing mask next year! there‚Äôs one thing public large know do, it‚Äôs snatch defeat jaws victory pandemic. 

I get voted hell say ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs maybe keep wearing masks mall months ensure never deal pandemic again‚Äù.  amount super-spread particular areas country. Start congratulating everybody see without mask getting vaccine. that, anti-vaxxers soon begin voluntarily masking symbol anti-vaxxhood KNOW get vaccine get us stop congratulating it. could check card. Half respondents said least 80 percent Americans, including children, would need vaccinated would safe activities without precautions. 

Statements like always make question thinking respondents article author. ok ignoring immunity natural infection? CDC estimated 30% US infected Covid. assume people go get vaccinated also assume portion not. half infected don‚Äôt get vaccinated need 65% population get vaccinated reach 80% immune. terrible diarrhea currently hot tub. way leads possible mutations variants due quick spreading, would make vaccines less effective. Bad idea. better trust science. Jesse ""Emperor Black People"" Jackson? understanding children died seasonal flu Covid last winter. whole article group people getting vaccine. wrong point another group also really embraced vaccine? Honestly phrasing issue part. saying vaccinated people going continue continue wear masks talking people planning getting vaccinated. continue wear especially following CDC guidance closely. Like replaceable piercing based mood occasion. approve. race bottom everyone loses corporations. make run country cheaper, make every single citizen pay lot taxes Who, me? study changes behavior. survey attitudes. 

Studying attitudes translate info policy decisions. Nothing indicated survey influence policy.

The ""research"" appears misapplied. 

Misusing data mean scientists know they're doing. Thanks links. probably lot work put together. None really responsive saying, interesting resource.

I think agree following:

* fraction people received covid vaccines nevertheless become infected virus.

* good idea fraction one collecting data competent fashion.

There also question whether breakthrough infectees amplify transmit virus others.

These seem like urgent questions me. Right even easier counterfeit though, anything better nothing. part following new zealand Australia's approach instead read twitch streamer, gonna get hesitated, hes ER covid.

Hey made point. Who's fault hesitated? Personal responsibility thing adults supposed have.

He made bad choice he's paying it. sucks chose roll dice lost. Trust science. 

Your Twitter research doesn‚Äôt make expert. 

Do know better cdc?  CDC guidelines still say wear mask public transit, would different? 

I think we‚Äôve reached point Cuomo arbitrarily putting restrictions NYC rest state isn‚Äôt good idea. study pretty clear. 

35% Republicans likely get vaccine mask, social distance, lockdown guidelines stay place post vaccinated people. 

53% Republicans likely get vaccine mask, social distancing, lockdown guidelines place vaccinated people. fucking clue CDC thinking made recommendation. ***CLEARLY*** going abused antivax/antimask idiots. Masks protect people you. It‚Äôs mystery people don‚Äôt get flu vaccine every year. It‚Äôs usually covered insurance completely get pharmacy. feel like saying cheap argument. That's kind dark.  think amusing people downvoting honestly expected it. people understand retired work public honestly never leave house unless much-needed circumstances. husband fully vaccinated quite running around. calm tits! wish knew variants circulating. Would reassuring know B.1.1.7 one one weird E484K/Q ones like B.1.617.2. one 8 yankees get? still family members believe vaccines cause autism. is. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intended reflection character - poster pointing black people fall democrat umbrella likely hesitant. doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúman people fucking assholes‚Äù may ‚Äúso help change that?‚Äù 

Demonizing probably shitty approach persuasion. C'mon, complicated. said ""Yes!"". whole conversation thing ambiguous. CDC. follow stuff kinda closely. considered it. health departments government offices going allocate resources test people feel sick.

&amp;#x200B;

so line new 
Fully vaccinated people COVID-like symptoms following exposure someone suspected confirmed COVID-19 
Most fully vaccinated people COVID-like symptoms need quarantine, restricted work, tested following exposure someone suspected confirmed COVID-19, risk infection low.   know, allowed get vaccinated months.  say anything except himself. even get vaccine tv. Why? base want see that. difficult argue approach

Are serious? Dear lord people.

(Because Reddit feel defend right away claiming support Biden stating I'm fact vaccinated AF) guidelines encourage vaccination. Vaccinated people need mask socially distance. 

Now businesses government choose whether follow guidelines. 

That‚Äôs way it‚Äôs whole time.  to? Especially approval vaccinating young kids months away... original question relaxed guidelines work practice? answer either honor system vaccination proof depending preferences business government context. 

Thanks answering original question. see ""we're evaluating it"" exactly that... need figure best respond new differing views whether CDC accounted people lying. say yes, say no.

I know whether CDC accounted it. made made there. also source assumed updated guidelines issued CDC presumption everyone tell truth. 

I need source make claim. never made claim. mean worries side effects. boss moderate even nervous, healthcare worker assured he‚Äôd fine. 

Gets shot, gets horrible side effects last days, work week. teasing weeks leading vaccine appointment, still support vaccines, don‚Äôt judge folks hesitant flu season need get crowded subway future I‚Äôm wearing mask rest life perhaps. least 90% population get jabs.

You're gonna waiting then. doubt U.S. ever gets 90%. go read understand still ambiguous 'incentivized' means studies. predict vaccination rate plummet there's threshold dangle hesitant people. would bother now? There's absolutely reason assuming infrastructure verification materialize (it won't). Trumps always supported vaccine though. schools require proof vaccination businesses well. good gets.

The vaccinated move life anti vax give us herd immunity ignorance.

The circle life goes on. Here's question. Assume improve vaccination 10% (based said above, 10% seems likely). benefit 10% ongoing mask enforcement? 

Say increase 50-60% even 60-70% Why? can't make decent decisions lives, earth say government. yeah, I'm nearly them. speculation. Natural immunity might even better, don‚Äôt proper studies yet context, roughly 10x number school shootings annually. guess he‚Äôs waiting another accusation? I‚Äôm situation, two kids high risk due lung issues. unvaccinated wouldn‚Äôt wear mask I‚Äôd publicly shunned likely.

This poorly thought CDC. assume sociologists UCLA Harvard know doing. That's fine, still arrogantly naive missing point. think definition small town grossly larger realize. fingers crossed end transmission, might potentially end virus existence itself. be. refused get vaccine, get sick, you. Yeah don‚Äôt people know could get life back normal faster people get vaccinated? Coming false theory vaccines share online quite counterproductive that. saying. talking CDCs risk calculus. study done UCLA Harvard contradicts you‚Äôre saying. 

Businesses governments follow new CDC guidelines incentivizing people get vaccinated. clarify, yeah actually agree you. Seems like brief gap CDC recommending removal mask mandate coming effect. happens quickly, infections get us herd immunity. Protect can‚Äôt vaccinated, let everyone decide vaccination infection. Either way, pandemic ends. Scientists recommendations. Politicians legal authority make calls. Yeah, what‚Äôs incentive guidelines relaxed? Nobody‚Äôs going checking. create freeloader problem. People educated, want tax living shit every large company want every large company operate here. Billy gets keep 50c every dollar makes lemonade stand 50c cover expenses well pay help may need crosses street keeps full dollar(minus expense), Billy do? would obviously random sampling effort among vaccinated people, scientist would tell you. 

For reason seem option CDC. Seems like would important sound thing do, perhaps worried would tell wrong political story. original question relaxed guidelines work practice? 

The answer either honor system vaccination proof depending preferences business government context. 

And differing views whether CDC accounted people lying. say yes, say no. 

Nothing made there. also source assumed updated guidelines issued CDC presumption everyone tell truth. 
 
We used logic. think mine bit sound yours. first healthy adult working super essential job ti get vaccinated state, youd getting second dose now. Mid april opened everyone.

Not everyone hasnt gotten yet Cletus. stragglers fence. read twitch streamer, gonna get hesitated, hes ER covid. GF went house hunting shithole state one masks. That‚Äôs exactly someone magnetic microchip would say. imagine huge demand JnJ since don‚Äôt wait 5-6 weeks like vaccines. probably unpopular opinion hope mask wearing completely normal accepted like east Asia(Japan, Taiwan, China, HK, Korea etc) countries even post covid. 
Correct wrong anyone reading think East Asian countries masks mandate people wear common sense, considerate others. 
A lot people realize masks work great controlling seasonal allergies preventing others getting infected cold etc. Also it‚Äôs great keeping face warm winter. Plus added benefit makes community safer, cleaner healthier! Lastly feels good considerate others sick. Life back normal even people decide wear masks. Hope people think it‚Äôs like part wardrobe one decides like decide wear jacket it‚Äôs cold outside. end it‚Äôs respecting choice one decides wear one. respect choice America freedom important people(apologies Americentric statement) That‚Äôs exactly is. I‚Äôve heard several people say Yes, time look countries done, learn successes mistakes. business decision, like let fast food workers come/don't pay stay home/ sick, covid first time really universally USA.

At end day acceptable rise risk death increase revenue. researchers found addition trapping particles exhaled wearer, masks also protect wearer inhaling airborne particles, exhaled people. note, however, tests performed ideal lab conditions. team recommends people use three-layer masks flexible enough provide close fit. team reports best results come masks made tightly woven material outer layers filter material sandwiched actual study preprint. I've seen mention studies kind misconstrues things obvious whether incentivizing dangling end mandate point threshold vaccination rate dropping immediately matters, maybe clarify studies read them. still generally disagree  planet earth pandemic it‚Äôs pretty justified feelings anger saw idiots reckless mask wearing. know right? ex tour bus driver pre covid pandemic job totally went bye bye year ago still back!

People want pretend one sacrificed totally screwed last year covid masking shutdowns still effect mostly living pampered sheltered lives!  Anyone consider people *might* lied? 

I feel like similar issues polls lying, hmm? Say, six months ago?

Ofc, said govt policy mattered vaccinations. Lying fits agenda. anyone bother ask year president - reality testing required participate surveys. two weeks that, two weeks that....

At certain point becomes personal accountability issue, something broadly impact general public including vaccinated folks. time now. Oh pay... pay! wear mask I'm getting vaccine. go ahead ""gloss over"" daddy can't vaccinate every child things kill them.

Covid death rate kids 1-4 0.28% global total (all cause) death. 

To put perspective
23.844 kids died cause death.
67 children died covid that's 0.28%.

Do really need vaccinate children? 
Or farmaceuticals want believe need to? think people's main problem actually enforcing it. Without robust vaccine passport system, there's pretty much nothing stopping people lying status. going hard business government employ CDC guidance without effectively abandoning mitigation measures (and another surge occur result, zero public desire put measures back place).  people vaccinated following covid guidelines already, it‚Äôs people. ‚Äúthreat‚Äù before. I‚Äôm social psychologist, sociologist different (To split hairs, I‚Äôm actually social neuroscientist, PhD social psychology). And, lol, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ‚Äúrespected‚Äù certain topics know little bit about. 

I definitely infectious disease expert public health expert believe CDC good reasons enact decision. I... would really surprised find primary motivator increased vaccine uptake amongst hesitant groups. way decision implemented doesn‚Äôt seem like would motivating groups. Maybe assumed would sort accountability employers (which still possible, pessimistic)? Otherwise can‚Äôt figure demographic decision would tip vaccine hesitant vaccinated. term ‚Äúboneheaded‚Äù comes fears policy decision negatively affect family, term I‚Äôd, like, use peer review (although sometimes would like to). 50% vaccinated come don‚Äôt want people using masks anymore? Basically this. two young kids precautions them. protect others contact with. worried them, see evidence. enough others vaccinated, I'll worry even less.

To me, kids mental health important. want kids learning afraid time. still happily wear masks, country yet, ditch Why? goes CDC guidelines   Yep, that's actually exactly feel. Plenty viruses give people long term effects - HPV increases cancer risk later life, HIV even really show horrible effect immune system years later AIDS sinks in, things like mono hit people CFS, etc etc. Meanwhile never vaccine history gave people issue 2 months post-vaccination. 


You're totally right unknown potential long term risks. vaccine seems way safer virus. another poster mentioned above, ‚Äúgood reasons‚Äù apologism BS. Conservatives plenty ‚Äúgood reasons‚Äù suspicious government. Yet nobody apologizing getting vaccinated rightfully so. 

The vaccine hesitant adults children. Hundreds millions people worldwide received vaccines fine. Anybody able deduce safe protect deadly disease. 

We pretend emphasize vaccine hesitant effort convince get shot. privately us chickens? rationale bullshit illogical without legitimate ‚Äúgood reasons.‚Äù don‚Äôt luxury able work home. wear piece fabric face 5 days week 10 hours day. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs oppressive. cuts ability work immensely constantly fogs microscope. It‚Äôs annoying hell wearing dealing it. fam, hoping would gone it‚Äôs looking like Immunocompromised people still risk. Teens children. Older individuals vaccine may effective preventing infection. Variants countries pandemic far over.

There plenty reasons reach herd immunity (once again) you.  J&amp;J shot really good for. one done, need sneak again. good two shot vaccines, ""good enough"".

Also, buy $20 gift card say case water slipped shelf hit arm. manager gave card compensation. covers case develops bruise soreness injection site. genuinely don‚Äôt think 80% vaccinated even possible US. many anti-vaxxers, people hesitant, people don‚Äôt really care.

While think mask rule may premature month so, another year go.

At point acknowledge scientifically ideal feasible reality, must return personal responsibility ones health, especially solution health problem free widely available. decided longer trust vaccines. believe number breakthrough infections among vaccinated people grossly underreported, risk contracting Covid fully vaccinated high. also trust vaccines prevent long term complications. feel vaccines keep almost breakthrough infections asymptomatic mild, prevent long term complications. They're afraid asymptomatic breakthrough infection several months later diagnosed serious medical problem caused Covid virus. also fear unvaccinated people spread new mutant strains current vaccines effective against, render currently vaccinated defenseless them. Also fear unvaccinated people spread virus children immunocompromised cause vaccinated people asymptomatic breakthrough infections unknowingly spread children immunocompromised. Basically believe vaccines good enough feel safe unless everyone vaccinated gets vaccinated, virus controlled. Cope There‚Äôs always going risks every day life. Get it. Don‚Äôt put car you‚Äôre afraid risks. wearing mask means one vaccinated can't tell difference. Got second Pfizer dose two weeks ago. Since COVID began, felt stressed anxious lot. Getting vaccinated combined new CDC guidance feeling *almost* completely liberated. moved new city year ago, feel like much catch see.

I guess things different now, dunno. Asking people keep masks public indoor places ‚Äúforce entire country lockdown‚Äù. Yep. Unmasking places parents babies 12yos regularly shop huge mistake. would expect stores like Home Depot away mask mandates never see kids there, grocery store Target/Costco/WalMart away mask rules mistake IMO baby can't get vaccinated. I'm going school Monday without mask I'm feeling little anxious like I'm something wrong. I'm sure pass though wearing one start feel normal again. black person confirm this. It‚Äôs topic we‚Äôve talking family. Back 2020 made rule wait six months first vaccines administered see happen, well except work healthcare mandatory. us least first dose. people understand complexities running profitable business, tight margins really are. many cases choice isn‚Äôt paying taxes paying business one. Yea exceptions businesses would well state side (minus hefty bit profit) provide little competition margins wide enough account it. Far many fall first category, either don‚Äôt get business don‚Äôt get one minimum wage taxes lose money. It‚Äôs easy near sighted easy base beliefs today‚Äôs society collecting article titles like one. ‚ÄúTransit Kids‚Äù sounds like title Talking Heads album. Wow, able give highest level in-hospital treatment precautions they're taking society. That's amazing seem handling pandemic incredibly well.  I‚Äôm jail still take it? Every concerned parent know, including me, also one always got kids flu shot every year. Sure maybe adults. talking kids. group small statistically insignificant number covid cases deaths among them.  adult want, depending risk COVID high risk take gamble vaccine odds favor. high risk covid, put risk vaccine? much say remember that. want something complain life feels significant. Don‚Äôt worry, next thing freak around corner. discussion GP. first dose AZ, new info/regulations UK given AZ now. also specific underlying condition could affect clotting etc. GP said know advise second dose regulations may change again, 'wait news'. agree, clear scientists agree. NYT survey epidemiologists week majority favored indefinite masking. course trained risk averse. Children still wear masks. Nobody forcing take off. What‚Äôs issue? Masks work don‚Äôt they? Sorry there's misunderstanding. referring age ranges. vaccine expected available children young 6 mo's sometime early next year. That's I'm waiting for. feel like nervous (Rather 'outraged screaming Twitter') would describe personal feeling, I'll try give perspective thinking hopes fostering greater understanding. 

First off, feeling specific location. I'm western Washington, area that, initial surge control, excellent job keeping infection rates low. complaints that, meant we've seen little bit surge spring even rest country (which much higher natural immunity rates prior infections) seen infection rates plummet. lived southern California, current infections per capita roughly 1/6th are, would feel different. 

My main concern relaxation masking vaccinated individuals cause people vaccinated behave recklessly result case rates either remaining high sustained period declining much slowly would otherwise. matter much, children young get vaccinated worry much safety became infected, would mean they'd pulled school childcare tremendous pain ass. 

If local rates continue decline nervousness dissuaded. Vaccinated people catching spreading COVID. got vaccinated soon can, wearing mask anymore. link below, flu killed 172 kids 2018 Florida. link below, covid killed 43 people 24 Florida (as January 29th). I'm using Florida schools open whole school year (part complaint numbers). worst part flu deaths half deaths healthy kids. many healthy kids died covid comparison? I'm guessing almost 0. So, keep home small % high-risk kids covid probably reduce covid deaths kids near 0. Thus, worried send kids school now, OK sending kids school before?

And there's science explaining kids probably get affected spread virus much due starting develop ACE2 receptors covid uses infect cells. kids getting sick, means likely virus replicating much leading also spreading either obviously. Thus, numbers explanation parents keep kids masks avoid risks come covid also kind parents probably murder kids. long employees still required wear masks, especially since many may two weeks past second dose, seems common courtesy keep wearing mask now.  Maybe 5G microchips vaccine sort virus-dampening Great question! find [that answer He's saying age 6 months+. Hell yeah lazy mooches Reddit tends magnify extremes. side effects mild non-existant people, hear stories. Lol , think iPhones carry around everywhere negate need 5G chip

The phones Xr 4g I'm assuming less actual hiking, influx tourists flying world, crowding two cities base camps near. 

Kinda like sports - spread serious bars public transport way game actual stadium think fair propose heavy leaning GOP folks likely COVID. may hope populations (Vaccinated Exposed COVID) mutually exclusive standard probability would suggest. respect that. Especially since kids known high risk transmission. kids, would likely position them. good news covid run pretty rampant rest year, getting us closer herd immunity level. believe CDC truly, honesty recommends believe best time, believe every time. pretending smarter them. tell wear mask save healthcare professionals? Okay. tell wear mask all? Okay. tell unmask I‚Äôm vaccinated? Okay. 

Right they‚Äôre recommending, I‚Äôm going it. Luckily voice matter. Whether like not, whether agree not, form verification, even it‚Äôs travel (but would place hefty wager that). COVID continue exist rest lives. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt believe return ‚Äònormality‚Äô ever provided annual vaccination  That's great, assholes expectation share minimum level hygiene slow spread virus. people children (the point article), makes going places riskier. two infants way we'll make work fine, things like taking one even quick grocery store run table get vaccinated. I'm arguing people fully vaccinated able go back sense normalcy. clinical nursing professor Hawaii years; think average 50% Filipino nurses Okay solution is, get vaccinated america. Today would great day get first shot peace mind.

Bubba longer rule life yay! Let guess. White guy grew middle class family?  doubt it, there's serious *Munchausen's proxy* vibes oozing many ""concerned"" mothers... Exactly. Got vaccinated months ago. morons continue tempt fate, doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.  wearing mask longer oppressive you? want unemployment rest life huh. take extra step move feeling verifying? mean wasted time making stupid comment, could spent looking actual data.

It's like made comment fly. literally coronavirus subreddit. we're asking masks, nothing else. wear mask save 499 children? I'm saying vaccinated person wearing mask matters except insofar wearing one allows blanket mandate everyone wears one. one wear mask, back going anywhere high risk child. seems like generalization know PANGO number?  really dumb... literally 0 ways enforce this. 

Do really think majority unvaccinated people follow 'honor code' continue wear mask vaccinated?  Well people willingly unvaccinated fuck em let catch Covid. Guess political ideology fostered distrust government last 40 years reach herd immunity? Apparently 50% California‚Äôs residents vaccinated. numbers similar states? It‚Äôs slippery slope. airborne virus. Masks help deter that. Vaccines developed. Soon vaccines approved age groups, point people longer need masks. then, unbelievably easy wear small piece fabric public slow spread. selfish people problem this, selfish people ones cause pandemic drag longer. care people unvaccinated? I‚Äôm vaccinated, since January. Let risk health issues. It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs political bias. Neither group good reason hesitant. motive country like Israel play along US politics American big-pharma‚Äôs plan world domination?

Sounds like never spoken kind people believe sort thing.

There's lot crossover ""people think vaccines government plot destroy population"" ""people think Israel source evil world"". one situations venn diagram two groups would near-perfect circle. think extremist belief  know history government ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù campaigns people color? Lol saying one big team isn‚Äôt us vs. them. It‚Äôs us vs. virus. silly frustrated people wanting help out. never even answered question, would like elaborate nuance situation failing understand? end? get scenario imagining. people saw reactions children diabeties. Diabetics different story, way scarier heard. one gave bunch asymptotic cases one mild case... rate hospitalization children 18 8 100,000. much protection vaccines confer 99.992%? long child isn‚Äôt immunocompromised doesn‚Äôt seem like vaccines help all. Unless think 100% children take vaccine help protect 0.008%. need lecture me, best friend ever life cousin well graves covid 19!

The solution now! Anyone country vaccinated free! day week! numbers falling big time! could link examples sub already.

The CDC scientists say fully vaccinated (I am) free drop masks get life. sorry offends somehow I'm sorry kids others special needs purpose masking shutdown restrictions social distancing keep hospitals medical system overwhelmed like India now.

It never 100% eradicate covid 19! never happen likely. Fortunately even ways cope compromised immune systems since pandemic came America. mentioned want don't, forgot mention can't. can't still need precautions endanger them. 

I'm fully vaccinated feels like freedom.  one know side effects, ymmv problem good vaccines available here. sinovac -- even nearly enough doses that. Also, French said vaccine good. 

So obviously we're going want take spite, stick french haah. really confused this. vaccine work like prior vaccines, mRNA vaccine. simply put tricks body producing antibodies would fight covid chance get it, still contract transmit like people unvaccinated? true, would anyone afraid someone unvaccinated? vaccination shorten period infected spread( would think true based body ready fight earlier, heard nothing this). Please stop. I'm American anti-vax, political leanings nothing decision get vaccinated. Exactly. worry long-term symptoms also. Personally, I'd annoyed got covid right trouble going stairs house. happens toddlers, I'd devastated. real bummer mentioned above: kids 12 don‚Äôt option protect rely others mask vaccinate. definitely feel safer adults life vaccinated, sucks son can‚Äôt be. Jesus people like sound like *want* happen. Also, gives shit unvaccinated kill themselves? 12-17 living antivax parents. Republicans ready sacrifice grandma reopen early save economy, aren‚Äôt willing get vaccinated.  mind went CDC announcement. younger daughters asthma loosening restrictions troubling. get feeling didn‚Äôt give shit cdc said lined views, yesterday, maybe save fake surprise. You‚Äôre literally looking drama none. really get CDC least say they'll 5 weeks so.

That's CDC works, say ""we're going issue guidance 5 weeks now."" That's essentially thing saying guidance issued now, know science 5 weeks, now.

The CDC science-based organization. issues guidance based knows, learns something new, updates them. CDC care many people yet vaccinated state, much time people fence need issuing guidance. They're basically saying ""get vaccinated get fucked"" anyone fence, without actually giving time get vaccinated.

The ""they"" state government release mandate, CDC. CDC's guidance nothing actual mandates.   better works. still people can‚Äôt get vaccine health reasons/allergies.

It‚Äôs super rare, gf lucky allergic reaction üôÉ Yes, bringing daughter indoors public unless it‚Äôs necessary. also wear mask doesn‚Äôt feel left out. own, mask. 

Make whatever choice right family, US doesn‚Äôt need shut anymore. warranted disbelief people pushing vaccine people unvaccinated. dumb. Yeah right key. I‚Äôve fine wearing mask thus far, I‚Äôll continue wear one business requires/requests it, I‚Äôm vaccinated it‚Äôs nice know don‚Äôt trust people‚Äôs behavior order feel safe. understand people can‚Äôt get vaccinated, always going heightened risk society general going wear masks forever protect segment population.  bunch deaths California actually old ones still recorded? Maybe make sign hang around neck vaccinated ?  completely accurate severe cases. Unfortunately, mild moderate cases pretty shitty adults. would suck least much kids. don‚Äôt want kid go that, family continue wear masks although adults 16+ teens vaccinated. said covid young people, really gets notably worse flu 30+. reason take flu (or covid) shot though, since protect others even side effects way less inconvenience getting minor illness.  could people always done responsible risk management. you‚Äôre risk person don‚Äôt risk activities. That‚Äôs things always been. elderly high risk categories need worry. people fine, I'm morbidly obese Covid 2020 fine. lot fence people also there‚Äôs lot ‚Äúwell, what‚Äôs point still restrictions I‚Äôm vaccinated?‚Äù 

This new mandate gives *those* people selfish reason get vaccinated. Yeah, people seeing others get covid non vaccinated wearing masks. 

If vaccine lifted mandate area, matter time get it. CDC disaster whole thing. Trump charge, rightly got bulk blame, incompetence distracted poorly handled everything. huge component public health communicating public safety best practices. bungled every public communication leading confusion, territorial cooperating others required, slow communicate even opaque important urgent issues quick communicate small uncertainties delays days might make difference perception. responsible lot distrust confusion. 

This announcement another example bad strategy. Instead taking week prepare state &amp; local health departments order prepare coordinated dropping requirements clear communication households children (or common situations) do, recommendations percentages vaccinated would allow county drop requirements, released preparation way, leaving states counties surprised unexpected announcement everyone else. 

The science might side, public rightly confused concerned seem disregarding huge segments population. announcement didn‚Äôt acknowledge people can‚Äôt yet get vaccine. Trust comes pattern predictable behavior communicates stakeholders clearly. Yes know recommendation referring vaccinated people. thing people worried real world way enforce vaccinated population. go local grocery something 3 year old, vaccinated nothing protect person wearing mask lying vaccination status.

I'm saying vaccines masks work. course do. saying vaccine works obviously, wearing mask protect much protects others. someone spewing covid around without mask, wearing one going give whole lot protection. people get this? Fucking hell. microchips going vaccine tomorrow.  totally agree, people make huge deal give kids flu vaccine hypocrites.  actually give numbers. 

* Average Kroger store, based profits, divided store, makes $948,000 per year net profits ($18,230/week). accurate, holdings, leave makes best argument case. stores considering performing, would considerably less $948,000 per year (calculations 2% average margin last year, Kroger's net margins 1.81%, lost huge bump hoarding).

* law put effect $4/hour hazard pay per employee.

* average number employees 41 full time. Generally closer 70 part full included. sure Ralphs Food 4 Less, let's use 40.

* take 40 employees * 40 hours * $4/hour, $16,160 per week, per store, additional $1,212 employer sponsored FICA (7.5%). top that, Kroger additional 6.2% employee $132,000/year 1.45% employee wages. Since would $132k, would 7.65%, additional $1236.24/week. $16,160 + $1,212 + $1236.24 = additional $18,604/week expenses. check additional Los Angeles employer fees. $18,230/week net profit minus $18,604/week = -$375/week.

* None stores average stores, likely change caused bleed $9,000+/week half profit average store. 

Yes, overall corporation handle loss stores, cascades stockholders lose faith chain. causes stock prices lower lessens contingency funding, really bad thing something causes economic downturn. know long term effects kids getting flu. know long term effects getting covid. can't know. know vascular damage pretty common adults covid present kids older, goes undetected. little insight - unfortunately much time:

Capitalism tragedy.

We learned benefits vertical horizontal division labour beginning Industrial Revolution. result, took labour structure well human being. worker longer integrated community, longer saw purpose, finished product exposed monotony. 

The worker became lonely, ""family"" dissolved work individual within organisation valuable work community. Everyone specialised individual activities. easily replaceable, something oppose capital, otherwise worker exposed abuse.

Capitalism dissolved social structures diminished power labour. today, able adapt social structures. Social media acted catalyst recent years. Gig-economy... disaster.

Uncontrolled capitalism - Capitalism politically unbounded used element control every area tragedy.

But... incapable organising needs centrally. imperfect information, impossible us assess capabilities strengths - determine right path outside stress test market. costs organisation would immense, abuse power unchecked. 

We need private ownership market management demand supply = Capitalism.

The term capitalism defined many ways - many definitions political. term essentially means wrote above.

Capitalism never unchecked turbo capitalism USA abomination. But... Yeah, unvaccinated adults mask give kids. Masks work best people might COVID wear them. name Robert Paulson. Yah tiny penis evens  law cite? winging hoping lawsuits? definitely agree mot relying guessing. I‚Äôm speculating. it‚Äôs worth though, I‚Äôm sure antibodies significant B cell immunity. seen reporting sub natural covid immunity good 1 dose one vaccines, again, hard numbers take grain salt. Yeah, even though think decision relax mask policies premature, I'm really curious see impact case numbers next weeks. I'm hoping case numbers control, boost confidence vaccination efforts around world. Colleague mine they're FDA approved, everything emergency-use-authorized. antivaxxer, btw. meh, hes done best job tristate area, hard unseat him. guess wants vaxx numbers allowing indoor masklessness. see. No, they‚Äôll ruin get covid. vaccinated fine. Speak Lol, vaccines **so** good reviewing data, CDC, Biden administration, nearly every single state government completely reversed course necessity masks. last time saw much unified change something fundamental?

Vaccines work. work incredibly well. point I'm opinion people vaccinated hurting themselves. I'm longer going let people dictate do. vaccinated that's you.  masks big deal (provided kind physical labor sport). However, another redditor pointed out, symbol loss hardship lot people. needing wear one time big morale boost many vaccinated safe aren‚Äôt already chosen be, they‚Äôll ones putting risk always. 

Hopefully sink sub days. He'll cave NYC desperate revive tourism time summer trade. Cuomo's career dead point, he's worried keeping head long enough end term. Give two weeks &amp; budged watch Democrats impeach him. anyone, vaccinated, drop guard. gotten vaccine leave mask. also believe let people wear mask anytime feel weather, like Asian countries do. male models? always week two delay . nice victory lap press conference yep, federation. centralized confederation. much unitary government.

and individual states weirder governments, like NJ, municipalities huge amount power. Yup. higher goals parent kids survive experience.

For instance, I‚Äôd like learn spell also use decimals. deBlasio embarrassments. understand they‚Äôre saying, young child, people might encountered unvaxed unmasked wouldn‚Äôt wearing masks even without guidance. people interviewed mad general want outlet. added, ‚ÄúI absolutely don‚Äôt trust people what‚Äôs right wear masks they‚Äôre vaccinated. that‚Äôs going put children risk.‚Äù

Does believe people still aren‚Äôt vaccinated going wear mask told to? No, folks Walmart Target Lowe‚Äôs refusing wear mask months existing mask mandates. understand concern kids issue getting people vaxxed trying force people wear mask they‚Äôve refused year. co-workers teenage kids says LOTS parents playing fast &amp; loose age requirements many children play league sports/travel ball really risky interacting tons outsiders weekly basis. Variants countries come via countries like UK well, banned, new variants pop domestically anyways, especially relaxed masking policies.  


My biggest issues CDC's latest mask policies are; potential new escape variant, buffer 12-15 years get vaccines. really waited July 4th declare it, opinion. Unvaccinated children still mask distance. reason? gives crap? Dying car crash may take one two lives you. Spreading Covid crowd may take dozens. I've back gym I've vaxxed worn mask choice. Unless hard cardio big deal. running outside mask really needed wear one there. Except previous infection doesn‚Äôt always protect new variants asks mutations occur vaccines won‚Äôt protect against. mean virus existed year-ish. going take while.  Honor system. truly vaccinated fear liars. Immunology says vaccinated people don‚Äôt need masks anymore.

Sociology Psychology unconvinced allowing people go maskless indoor public places cause net good society.

Choosing two science, it‚Äôs judgement call.  Yeah they'll make acomodations inline ADA. Watch many people claim copd / asthma / anxiety etc would harmed rules. 


While directly discusses service animals, general outlines based honor system. Claim medical issue &amp; masks would exacerbate issue. law must make reasonable accomodation &amp; CDC revoked masks required public vaccinated guidance. can't see legal HR department risking lawsuit Feds pulled rug them. We'll, COVID-19 single strand RNA virus, incorporate DNA like retroviruses. know that, I'm pretty sure average kid &lt;12 y/o spend 15% life lockdown must mentally healthy either. going that, sure get N-95s otherwise protecting others yourself. N-95s readily available anyone concerned unvaccinated people spreading things. I'm glad finally tools individuals protect see fit beginning transition back normal life. said. mean young kids least risk. Don‚Äôt understand restrictions lifted India places oxygen crisis Covid ravaging population.  heard Captain Obvious, Doctor Obvious? Honestly, kind surprised (though certainly all) political responses pandemic.

If told six years ago pandemic would ravage United States, beginning Republican presidency, government leaders would institute sweeping lockdowns gathering restrictions lasting year, would predicted *Democrats* would resistant infringements individual liberty name national security Republicans. that‚Äôs coming left-of-center person votes almost exclusively Democratic! Whatever happened conservatives concerned addressing outside threats ensuring national security, liberals concerned protecting personal autonomy?

On hand, I‚Äôm surprised right resistant vaccines left. lockdown stuff still surprises me. Maybe shows parties changed last decades, idk. ppl taking kids would entail close indoors contact extended period time? like taking toddler bar-hopping MMA match. get parents hamstrung entertainment venues like theme parks &amp; bowling alleys &amp; movie theaters allowing un-masked patrons, forever. Dr. Fauci predicts vaccine approval under-12 kids come fall. plenty safe outdoor activities families enjoy involve close contact seated spectator. I‚Äôm ya, states would even share extra 5 million would put dent second doses too. Hell 70 million surplus, send 10 millüòÄ actually covid long haulers ignored media fairly recently. use meds. Maybe learn subject making comment displays ignorance. Tldr; yep  country's vaccination rate nearing 40% new guidance Centers Disease Control Prevention saying fully vaccinated people need masks anymore, conversation surrounding future work relevant ever. NPR's Things Considered wants know work looked like past year, feel going back office. Share thoughts questions us form NPR producer may touch upcoming story we're working on. seen evidence happening children COVID higher rates viruses? don‚Äôt like think fact kids suffer complications every year common viruses, do.

Several states great policies tying removal mask mandates % population vaccinated gone window now. Surely Japan Times bigger worries closer home vaccine hesitancy. Kids low risk group - covid big threat driving car. lack perspective kids need emotionally appalling. 

This move cdc allows personal responsibility. People choose bring kids not. world everyone 12 get vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt restricted sake low risk population. isn‚Äôt sustainable. Okay. contain magnetic nanochips?

This observation two places lived pandemic (California Florida). vast majority people masked. stores best enforce policy people masks gave whined online. wear masks prove anything. rejoicing. result, think common sense wrong. common sense worrying population die due risky behavior nothing CDC decision.

I think CDC play favorites try protect certainly think misguided covid still deserve remain alive. ignoring points, anti-maskers may die policy. unvaccinated people wearing masks (due new guidance) also putting vaccinated risk otherwise would (some vaccinated still get covid)....and putting old enough get vaccinated risk otherwise would be....and immunocompromised risk otherwise would be....and people unable vaccinate (due allergies you) higher risk otherwise would be. 

So no, I'm concerned anti-maskers anti-vaxers here. also create trust CDC vaccines future pandemics. paints positive image people get vaccines, CDC reasonable relax masking.

That's interesting point considered. positive new guidance still see bigger gain life saving necessity unvaccinated still wearing masks. like keep saying, test common sense trend based data. See works you.

Yes well we're test subjects now....so goes Walmart goes rest society short time would guess. would nice try smaller scale first get actual real world data suggesting entire country nope....from coast coast masks optional EVERYBODY many public places. Let's hope vaccinations rates INCREASE point due policy....due so-called carrot suggest placed front Americans. see happening honestly truly would delighted WRONG this. 

If vaccines stall we'll know carrot enticing all. Dear vaccine-hesitant, It‚Äôs haven‚Äôt heard say hundred times you‚Äôre concerned ‚Äúno long term health data I‚Äôm young made cousin sick three days.‚Äù It‚Äôs you‚Äôre cherry-picking facts ignoring others. (When last time vaccine caused, long-term, hundreds thousands deaths, lung damage, liver damage, brain damage, *after* large-scale tested?) yes, driven politics. know you‚Äôre denying it, that‚Äôs cognitive dissonance talking. lived myth-and-narrative driven response pandemic, hasn‚Äôt inspired confidence impartiality reason. Rare. Keep home then. Nobody forcing  flu deadly kids covid. mask distance kids covid? think lot us skeptical timing. keep dropping like are, wait June even July 4 cases could potentially 1 100k people? still lot virus circulating country. seems like CDC could focused benchmarks instead ripping teeth local state mask ordinances random Thursday afternoon.

Long covid thing, hard compare covid flu season never precautions place flu like last season. lot us would like see maybe 5,000 cases day localized approach all. ask antivaxxers get shots correct, definitely thought today 16th. get something like 70 percent immunity first shot, we're immune enough opinion. CDC seems share view. making illegal injected substance different illegal walk around naked, latter non-intrusive established social cultural norm practiced centuries (in places) sounds like feeble attempt ‚Äògotcha‚Äô point try justify mandatory vaccination. It‚Äôs even funny forget new policy involving MTA input MTAs worker union well. likely want restrictions robust rest city interest protecting station crew operators. think transit end keeping masks fair bit longer city general it'll fade quietly due lack enforcement later year, opposed big formal drop, knows? Vaccines need testing concern safety, really there's testing that's possible do. Hundreds millions people gotten almost dangerous side effects. Maybe help: reason they're EUA instead full approval nothing side effects. We've already done testing determine possible side effects, even though vaccines broadly long term side effects could skipped step really trying go faster.

The reason EUA unclear long term efficacy vaccine be. virus mutate quickly vaccines ineffective couple months? appears no. couple years? really know yet. year vaccine clearly benefit you, know we'll end reformulating every year like flu vaccine what. ""Covid-19 flu: Influenza killed one child far flu season - Washington Post"" basic facts upset. India dealing bunch asymptotic cases people vaccinated?

Because not, point irrelevant... reflects people lack empathy got vaccinated (aren't yet protected), teenagers (just became eligible), kids, immunocompromised people (and others vaccine work effectively)....

These new relaxing restrictions means even vaccinated wearing mask, unvaccinated people (anti vaxxers) also wearing masks. cannot get vaccine, risk flu, measels, etc, another item plate.  


 
How effective would air. people discuss MD specialist, ND. never existed serious extent. thought might, took extreme measures prevent it. surface transmission.

I'm afraid source handy, I'm making up.

**How Volunteer Abroad I‚Äôm sitting bar restaurant next someone fully vaccinated fault fault catching COVID becoming fully vaccinated?  Antivax won‚Äôt wear mask wont take shots anyway. dont see difference here. feel like OP trying engage disingenuous conversation. Might getting ‚Äúon fence‚Äù people getting vaccinated see people dropping masks ADA makes accommodations kids immunodeficiencies including making people wear masks kids immunodeficient, underlying conditions (like mine) doctors assessed make susceptible virus. 

This virus presents unique risk it‚Äôs serious prevalent vaccine children, it‚Äôs also highly contagious. risk can‚Äôt get vaccinated too. prolong pandemic contribute mutations. suck. agreed 2nd paragraph. Yes. 

On 1st: vaccine best thing likely closest cure time being: jump start making changes instead shutting whole world another year so? Right, well proves much todo nothing than. Glad hear proven Covid-19 completely harmless. Bit morbid question:

Has Covid sped waiting list needing things like kidneys, livers, etc? imagine sudden amount deaths globally decent amount would organ donors right? transmission issue, could (or we) freeze organs died cure? 80% number may outdated back restrictions. updated data Israel reflecting much lower percentage (huge trial, real world data):

""A large observational, real-world study Israel estimates Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 46% effective preventing infection 14 20 days first dose 92% 7 days second dose, backing results earlier randomized, controlled trial, according study today New England Journal Medicine (NEJM)."" knows actual percentages variants floating around. calling chicken love top post sub right now, elsewhere can't talk politics all.    think one sticking point we‚Äôre already seeing impacts neurological system people covid. it‚Äôs complete unknown - already observed impacts parts body. fact used words ‚Äúpolicy like locking down‚Äù context clue talking locking down, masks. wont last long. I‚Äôm already seeing people go unmasked. That‚Äôs gonna sway people eventually nearly everyone maskless. 

If cases go up, good natural immunity antivax crowd

If cases keep going down, good time celebrate. Wait minute. Covid impact young children? data I‚Äôve seen (and I‚Äôm engineer who‚Äôs done fair amount research) young kids danger flu Covid. wear masks every flu season? Happy see data. Masks gonna new M*GA hats Humanity operate logic unfortunately. wife's unit expanded reopened covid floor month despite 2 months ago clean ICU first time since pandemic started.

I trust CDC knows wish throughout ""Hurray masks done!"" talk reminded public woods this.  61,000 flu 61.000 covid, comes next virus concern. lethal diseases re-framed ""old man's friend"", shrugged mostly old die? long covid younger survivors really count? Well, friends family split two groups new mask guidelines. one hand, we‚Äôve got folks happy move on, likely wear mask it‚Äôs required. hand, folks terrified leave house (despite vaccination status). weirder third hand, we‚Äôve got folks think CDC part large conspiracy murder people. 

This weird time. got kill people ignoring threat. Sucks vaccine non-responder. big lie progressives say: There‚Äôs way pay policies without hitting middle class too.

Besides, saw got replies folks said thing did. long enough reach enough vaccination status, though. We're never going eliminate it. mitigating risk. congrats -- spared torture mask weeks. 

Just following science like always done since started. sub used honor science. much thats sad. Damn, crazy see many people HATE mere existence little kids. 50 years ago. lot changed since then. [Children 2 shouldn‚Äôt wear expect loosen mask mandate, they'll keep mandatory everyone mass transit. NYC bus driver zero issue demanding put one (as get watch week so) there's mutliple containers masks bus. Demanding specifically transit regardless vaccine status would simplest way go. CDCs new guidance even excludes transit specifically. 

I doubt they'll try implement city-only mask policy because:

1) would run messaging they've operating reopening city capacity next week.

2) would extremely hard enforce city level. many people ranging LI, NJ upstate habits inertia.

3) already strained relationship governor mayor would get worse. want one drop mandate governor dawdles, mayor start swinging political gain. 

4) summer starting, places open competing ones didn't. Waiting long unmask could leave city open visitors people planned trips places elsewhere earlier.

5) unmasking big political capital expiry date. president rest country say time (as governor) not, better cynically hope things get way worse nationally people get lazy masks get clout points it.

Just opinion course. like people attitude ‚Äújfc it‚Äôs mask get it‚Äù

Some people seem tolerate masks better others.

Myself, hate stuff face want rid masks first opportunity. I'll always follow rules, though; I'm anti-masker asshole type. supposed keep place ‚Äúchild care‚Äù here, cover summer camps, know private ones hesitant enforce it. 

Last summer couple camps laid plans limited sizes parents ignored everything ass make sure followed rules made comfortable giving money first place. mRNA vaccines 30 years old. expensive develop, traditional vaccines way things long time. Thank putting eloquently! That‚Äôs point. shouldn‚Äôt throwing unnecessary hurdles people get life saving vaccine. Every barrier means fewer people ultimately get it. 

It would like arbitrarily said kids get vaccine Monday. easy possible people get slightest. - stealthy unvaccinated anti-maskers lie say vaccinated. vocal ones say wear mask get vaccinated.  am, many stores still mask guidances up, I‚Äôm going obey those. come down, stop wearing mask. see point ignoring rules store, moment exit, mask 100% coming off. greatly overestimating sophistication average Starbucks customer. thinking here? course doesn‚Äôt matter direct safety. problem immunocompromised, cancer chemo patients, kids, willfully unvaccinated (even though deserve it). virus ripping 40% people haven‚Äôt vaccinated unfortunate. 

I understand kids less effected still hundreds deaths thousands hospitalizations could wait months vaccinated fall. large chunk population also better protect rest herd immunity. Like vaccines. Crazy still get flu, huh? Covid forever. Accept never going back life 2020. get booster every year. gf got first today ! clinic opened 830am got 7am one first people seen. felt bleak regards vaccination efforts really picking now, I'm seeing LOT friends got first dose too!! I'm talking people unable leave homes due medical condition. point No, doesn't... guess depends you‚Äôre cosplaying. Ninja cosplayers probably easier time it.  end day

At end day, avoiding everything anyone history roughly similar skin color bad experience bit unrealistic, ye? Making mountains mole hills claiming you‚Äôre oppressed Target asks wear mask shopping. I‚Äôve seen plenty adults last year finally made run patience keeping kids away everything better resiliency adults. Ideal? Masks maybe another month two US, everyone gets vaccinated. ideal practically possible, course. Anyone without vaccination now, except children, going wear mask. letting infect guess. near 4000 New York near Los Angeles car plane. Well, guess speculation suffice. political enemy gets ""bad"" dose. ???? 

I mean, trans woman, comment things perspective trans woman. fully support trans brothers cis sisters though fact repeated again... -Allergies

-Forgot shave

-Birthmarks/scars ""How check vaccine status"" subs new ""what variants?""

Anything people grasp drag restrictions longer ignore science says time start packing People 16 opportunity yet vacinated.

It really shit thei POV. sacrifice much life last year adults willing sacrifice anything them. can't tell troll I'll give benefit doubt. look risk virus ""normal"" state. Normal state flu season literally year 2019 prior. Normal state Covid outbreak masks+distancing. yes, comparison 2 alike things. Oh sure, there's guarantee. article also date, looking globally.. meant specifically states.

It talks mutations- now, believe variant breaks vaccines have. Could happen later? Sure. also already accepted booster shots may well necessary, production make happen. talks human behavior factor, see rolling back mask mandate already. never going end never approach level vaccination needed worldwide (even industrialized countries), take precautions avoid spread. hopefully vaccines stay updated enough want remain protected variants so. true possible victims left children 12 under, let's mask get vaccinated near them. another year. Kids able vaccinate fall. large bolster herd immunity. There‚Äôs cautious optimism Cons I‚Äôm scheduled go later year. They‚Äôre going wait June make final announcement What's going next reason keep masks ""couple months"" I'm truly curious now.

Do ever line say ""yeah, gone long enough now""

I'm suggesting cut masks now, I'm saying ""they big deal"" code wearing forever lot people, going get pushback here...there line. think know cdc? said masks go vaccinated people. Science doesn‚Äôt care feelings still want vaccinated people wear masks isn‚Äôt science Even so, cis women issue overwhelmingly common yet never get mentioned. Trans men also never get mentioned topic trans people.

Why? You‚Äôre already way there. chances exposed Covid significantly lower six months ago, immunity rise. There‚Äôs really nothing freaked over. companies better make sure workers vaccinated cuz they're gonna greater exposure now. feel like people (including myself) talking trans people trans ourselves, lol. yes, plenty cis women affected well. stepmom allergic many vaccines hesitant, takes Spiro, good news her. really sucks immune compromised, cancer chemo patients, kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated. I‚Äôm liking new phase we‚Äôre willfully unvaccinated easily get away wearing mask indoors now. should‚Äôve waited kids get vaccinated. I've WFH 14 months now, they've told us we're going keep way permanently, even covid distant memory. love it. Suspending use AZ Canada seems make sense 'if Pfizer Moderna available Canadians next weeks'.

On hand, VITT incidents found S. Korea although 2m shots already administered. AZ vaccines account 10% total vaccines S. Korea purchased moment comprise nearly half vaccine supplies health authorities decided keep administering precautions age limit. shows people working home not. don‚Äôt understand conclusion. Starbucks officially dropping open floodgates since they're seen trendy cool lot demographics.

You'll see lot ""classier"" stores like Target clothing chains repealing mask policy now. Going unmasked Walmart hardly qualifies ""living"" I've missed on, guess. Fingers crossed :) side effects sound good context, btw‚Ä¶. Really hoping that‚Äôs positive sign. best careful right now. think one spike cases, hopefully keep going down. We‚Äôre slowly getting there. know cdc? Personally would wear mask still , many times CDC wrong pandemic ? LOT  CDC's guidance indicates need worry vaccination status others. primarily danger themselves. 0.8% child cases end hospitalization 0.01% child cases result death - Thats 200 times better adult death rate.

And rates falling since least May last year.

Now thats kids - high-risk kids. It‚Äôs university, state. Rutgers first announce it, others following. Check school requirements documentation. Exactly situation reasoning. seem pretty stupid made lot contradicting decisions pandemic got lot people killed Ahh, issues tend Spiro specific. anti-androgens used people weird side effects Spiro. employees still required to? Vanishingly small People Reddit don‚Äôt care kid haven‚Äôt noticed long vaccinated could careless it‚Äôs much exuberance Thursday, seems like there's slow pushback. can't deal ups downs! insanely frustrating seeing people zero medical background want keep pushing masks vaccinated people leave part people actual medical background saying CDC made informed good call ignored downtown still ghost town - doubt 20% workers returned. no, ""vast majority"".  Lucky! good outweighs bad, course, least case Spiro I've deal obnoxious side effects. care group unvaccinated specifically, we've never turned would head group small. unfortunate many immune compromised already live cautious way covid. 

More reasonably, kids access yet I'll mask them.

But average unvaccinated person? confusing empathy letting walk you. That's group mask this, distance all, get vaccine.

Now groups people wearing masks they're vaccinated considerate...mitigating even crazy unlikely case breakthrough infection...meanwhile anti-maskers/vaxxers damn thing.

You're spending time protecting people interest protecting literally fucking free. making mistakes, they're actively trying make situation worse others. empathy person can't get there, can't take time work. empathy dude screaming maskless need go back normal refuses get vaccine. That's called taking personal responsibility children. No. fact, I'm opposed going back office before. 

Being vaccinated mean I'm crowding together small, unventilated space bunch co-workers. may small chance dying contracting case COVID serious requires hospitalization, I've always concerned long COVID, catch even mild case.

So no. anytime soon. given CDC decision means we're going see cases start skyrocket within next several weeks, reasoning going seem pretty sound, pretty quickly. exactly makes much sense simply keep mask mandate place reach herd immunity levels, happen within couple months.

How know couple months? many sound articles indicating going happen vaccines. Here's [one well-respected source. mean don‚Äôt lot cosplayers wear masks anyway? Raise insurance rates also.
You know everyone‚Äôs going I‚Äôm sick antimaskers expecting society pay lack responsibility Former barista, seems entirely would work based experiences. friend still works recorded video two guys screaming employees asked put masks, back like June last year.  That's honestly think isolated places set date ending mask mandates policies yet.

They'll relent couple weeks pressure 180 lips coming out, yo NEVER going change minds people chosen get vaccinated. COVID stay, can‚Äôt continue insist vaccinated people wear masks forever science CDC says incredibly safe, even around unvaccinated, don‚Äôt wear masks indoors.

I manage small convenience store one strictest mask enforcements anyplace city. actively kicked people store wearing masks right yesterday. regular customers pretty good it, happened times week. store ran lean, employee (especially me) gotten COVID, store serious risk going under.

While half customers wore masks today, unmasked customers hours last month. person changed mask policy today, felt uncomfortable many unmasked customers didn‚Äôt recognize them. realized majority maskless individuals likely regular customers wore masks last year whose faces never seen. made feel better, I‚Äôd bet vaccinated.

Edit: Store policy created still requires kids wear masks well employees least 4th July. I‚Äôll reevaluate then. closed? Honor system...  would stay Twitter. know office workers gone back. Sample size dozen different business.

I haven't, work SCIF 
  new Gallup found 56% U.S. workers ""always"" ""sometimes"" working remotely January.

That means people back. People using handicapped spaces cost nothing, don‚Äôt expose terrible disease. Try again. could working 10 hrs + everyday. time make appointment work understaffed care vaccinated serving public. better Holland AZ only. would unbelievable would supply everyone pfeizer still waiting supply. correct response. new Gallup found 56% U.S. workers ""always"" ""sometimes"" working remotely January. 

That means people either always sometimes. people still home huge minority. people probably still talking Tiger King.  honestly matter happens America, mutation could easily pop anywhere around world proven way stop different variants coming country. anything variant going come India huge surge cases billion people infect. I‚Äôll keep around, one me. I‚Äôm going argue store employee it. yeah, default maskless. whole point masks wouldn‚Äôt hazard others. know vaccinated face isn‚Äôt hazard, it‚Äôs face requested otherwise. CDC contradicted many times personally would cautious new recommendations make. Yeah aunt drive another town wait long line lol. get mine local Walmart. Crazy much available they‚Äôve gotten. Thanks, hope &amp; keep safe too! got shots (Pfizer), immune response (chills, fever, tired, etc. nothing crazy). yup heard correctly. b-cells get depleted meds, hence they're thinking may make antibodies (and people med far, like 1/3). basically still t-cell response even make antibodies. b-cells technically preclude making either supposedly. Basically lot ""Yeah so, exactly know"", understandable. new meds vax. I'm going back couple weeks get blood drawn see. Keep fingers crossed me! Exactly sentiment. Like saw mom hugged first time since March 2020 unmasked home feels huge. Husband went restaurant yesterday first time since Feb 2020. I'll still wear mask business strangers around outside people know vaccinated. Good hear. Source? running lot easier time getting vaccinated people first line.

I amazed quickly got second shot mass vaccination center. months number cases hospitalizations area haven‚Äôt spiked consider maybe you‚Äôre wrong people town?  trans girl, really. haven‚Äôt negative effects. think maybe end 2021 early 2022 also get upset tyranny handicapped spaces close store entrances? Yes, often make sacrifices minorities. nothing new. It‚Äôs easy right thing do. No, one communication fails. 

What *should said* back ‚Äúkeep wearing masks, *we don‚Äôt know sure* can‚Äôt spread vaccination.‚Äù 

[Now, know. Vaccinated people vector transmission. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs okay around vaccinated people without masks on.  Kids aren‚Äôt risk aren‚Äôt spreading it. You‚Äôd think year science would taught now. 

We point vulnerable people gonna either get vaccinated and/or take extra precaution choose take. 

At point individual personal responsibility kick in? Never?

The time forcing society over. 

I‚Äôm sure makes feel better think I‚Äôm vaccinated dismiss say. Keep living fear! got vaccinated went Starbucks. rubbed shoulder scanner got 15% off. one cares.

They‚Äôre following science. Stay home you‚Äôre still scared. colleges universities states mandating incoming freshman required get vaccines? Georgia heard supposedly happening. fuck even requiring fact-check???

How insane believe drivel?? You‚Äôre making mountains molehills. they‚Äôre young, probably won‚Äôt even remember this. 

They‚Äôre, what, 3-4 years old? Covid practically doesn‚Äôt anything children young. (Or children general, especially younger ones.) don‚Äôt think even *have* keep away anywhere. Parent young child - I‚Äôm vaccinated moon joy don‚Äôt wear mask anymore. go places inside child - still wear masks fully vaccinated. It‚Äôs time start least beginning lift restrictions agree say can‚Äôt save everyone. put lives hold 14 months protect vulnerable. happily. time return normal. likely lengthy journey everyone comfortable going back normal need start somewhere.  words, ‚Äúfuck immunocompromised mother‚Äù understand people still climb Nepalese side, right? make sense. whole discussion around removing restrictions. Apparently westerners aware skeptical Chinese people gov. Aside topics, gov control wechat stringent people think. Arguing internet like pissing wind: you‚Äôre pissing Title little misleading, it‚Äôs Vaccinated Workers shoppers (if state, county, local laws allow) immune systems 95% people recovered COVID-19 durable memories virus eight months infection. except children primary driver community transmission long way contribute least amount hospitalisations  Business ask proof covid vaccination. That's protected.

Those easily forged printer. Sure might ask security theatre. hard pressed get legit medical proof indicate prevented wearing mask

Shrug, asthma nurse already offered letter say without asking. masks excarbate asthma, tried medication changes. luck offered letter saying much, otherwise asthma fully controlled. records bother need mask long.


My American GP offered vaccination exemption Uni expressed unease Meningococcal vaccine. got vaccination end disease looked horrible compared minute risks. estimate desire GPS get day without abusive patients shouting them. Writing note saying patient X can't wear mask reported causes issues will. least make wait outside get stuff you.


Which valid ADA accomodation &amp; option costco implemented masks hard ADA protections point accomodating would put others risk. everyone gotten shots required time therefore risk.


Tell CDC says fully vaccinated people need masks. patient X fully vaccinated &amp; prove accomodation going offer ? cheapest, easiest &amp; least confrontational wave through.



The big firms already saying honor system sure maybe small shop might. time next week doubt seeing face masks shops generally. kid serious asthma 9. shared concerns reopening folks reddit told asthma serious issue covid.  

Can please share articles this? son prone get hypoxia easily, pneumonia common cold, covid extremely scary us. Gee ya think? Silly lamenting rest grown fucking adults country can‚Äôt put mask mandate another month two control spread, instead children bear brunt able go anywhere amount 1/3 1/2 lives time get vaccinated. He‚Äôs trying come distractions scandals like it. Even though vaccinated people probably okay maskless you‚Äôre still giving opportunity spread thing that‚Äôs opportunity virus mutate Idk US Canada, get vaccinated get email confirmation got vaccinated name.

You easily pull email confirmation ID that's good enough. may bullet proof good enough ensure 99% legit. free vote feet shop store Costco. Personally, I'm happy see Costco following science. chip shortage? want brand new car damn Kroger‚Äôs still enforcing them. 

I‚Äôm surprised. 

Well, *enforcing* isn‚Äôt right word, per say. like requiring. There‚Äôs zero enforcement Kroger‚Äôs go to. needed happen people say ""if get it, get it"" ""i'll take chances"" made sign waiver forgoing medical services. 1. keep masking distancing. 

2. That‚Äôs choice you‚Äôll change mind quick mask free competition crushing you. Hopefully end legislation protect people‚Äôs privacy freedom reopen. holding breath. Don‚Äôt get wrong love Starbucks coffee get sense demographic folks going hanging spending $6 drink probably non anti vaxx crowd. 

Now Walmart hand... oof  üéØ lifting mask mandates vaccinated folks, **fully vaccinated rate barely 1/3rd**, **and without checking vaccinated status** big FU vulnerable kids can't get vaccinated yet shit still people dying feel families. grandfather died COVID complications first second wave California. glad see talk window aging grandmother. hope vaccinations letting family members more. People dragged kicking screaming pandemic, makes sense drag people kicking screaming it. ""not protective"" mean exactly? Like said, give numbers. 

For example, 90% ""not protective"" 91%. what? 90% still high protection even ""not protective"" 91%. 

Just saying something ""not protective"" pointless. need cite sources provide actual numbers. I'm NY people see wearing masks outdoors.   job decided let employees choose many days they‚Äôd like office zero on. check vaccination status? Wow 12-15 year olds showing strong! someone two weeks away second dose, sucks. whole ‚Äúif you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, move on. problem anyone else catches dies‚Äù quite morbid. Thousands people willing get vaccine halfway process may fully vaccinated another month. Besides, course, kids ineligible. would even harder hospital covid.

The ""shell life"" comment explicitly talking vaccinated people. worry hospitalized. Calling Charles Darwin! Let anti maskers free!  vulnerable eligible since February March. walk site get vaccine now, excuse anymore. feel bad employees work states without mandate companies kept mask policy. It‚Äôs setting screamed assholes don‚Äôt realize state mandates allow private businesses keep policy. think many chain stores dropped theirs, didn‚Äôt want different standards state put employees bizarre spot thought reason masks protect others, I'd also add question long-term effects mild asymptomatic cases, ""long covid"" things like increased stroke. things barely looked all, nevermind whether vaccine stops (some long-haulers helped vaccine, some).

It would also good know much virus still circulating. continues circulate look boosters such, get blindsided new variant.  never working honest. already weren‚Äôt wearing masks. 

Everyone worrying demographic people doesn‚Äôt exist. also don‚Äôt think people play 99.8% survive card realised many people 0.2% EVERYONE actually is. 0.2% 7 billion 14 million...  COVID19, people suggesting may problem cell line due extensive HIV research done it. line may contaminated reverse transcriptase. Probably best see result replicated worrying much it. new York one people would dress Indians rob people. I'm joking. Lol Can't depend honor country. Enjoy mask, great majority rest us going listen CDC‚Äôs evidence based recommendation. surgical cloth masks fall category equipment known source prevention equipment, meaning keep wearer dispersing droplets. Really something like n95, protects wearer way electrostatic attraction, counts personal protective equipment. someone unable vaccinated (because age restrictions, immune system conditions, vaccine availability) adequately protected majority masks  agree goal, proof vaccination something thought carefully ensure nobody's lying cannot vaccinated broadcast medical history. I'm saying never, I'm saying maybe let's give weeks figure it. literally remove mask mandates honor system, there's literally ZERO reason people get vaccinated. I've second shot still wear mask case numbers virtually zero area (years?). caught Feb 2020 long hauler. virus hell, finally able move heavy objects without running air vaccine. want take chance possible mutations vaccine handle get load attaches nerves waits activated. (Long haulers relate, move feel better. Moving around created new wave illness body.)

And percentage people get booster shots? people feel brave stop caring. fairly large segment already also. yes guess stick around though guess slow simmer. Yeah know people hell bent wearing masks forever. one year old vaxed really concerned getting it. going fine make sure one gets near stores outside. like taking kids bars something. Surveillance testing exists. methodology. 

Not active decision. Fall? Given low vaccination rates many heavily Republican states surprised see another summer surge Sunbelt like last year. feels like strawman. people saying former ecstatic people saying latter extremely pessimistic. Even friends cautious pessimistic saying I‚Äôll wear mask won‚Äôt don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs vaccinated people point. fully vaccinated there's almost negligible chance still contract COVID meaning there's almost negligible chance pass someone able get inoculated. magnets fry computer chips? actually know wondering lol. guess least keep simmering though vaccinated already it. 
You either going vaccinated catch eventually. worries me, honestly care people ignorant get vaccinated. However there's ton people (upwards 30% US population) serve vector mutations could lead variant resistant present vaccines.   vunerable people recently become eligible waiting list vaccine. people unable travel due medical conditions receive vaccine home. range elderly people, people disabilities, people oxygen.

There lot people still want need vaccine able receive yet. Please wait everyone wants opportunity get it. Yes, go [california covid compare deaths/day 'death date' 'reported date' see look quite different. hard say death rate right reporting delays. given case rates hospitalizations declined much last weeks, extrapolate weeks ago I'd guess probably still around 20-30 per day so. give shit? No, but, Hell No! Phil Murphy‚Äôs Twitter

‚Äú we're keeping indoor mask mandate place public settings and, approach vaccination target coming weeks, expect able lift soon.‚Äù

Not directly saying we‚Äôll lift soon hit goal giving concrete answer done restrictions. TBH know I‚Äôll downvoted waiting another month till hit 50+ percent fully vaccinated, another 10+ percent partially vaccinated, probably 70-75 percent adults least one dose doesn‚Äôt seem like worst idea. wish Murphy would set clear timetable. said I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll rid mask mandates within month think people freaking understandable overly pessimistic. biggest question remains cities like NYC, Newark, Philly, etc. got it. thinking meant recent laws banning COVID-related masks. one mentioned 1845. that's really interesting though - looks like designed anti-KKK measure! Good. Host friends house? Go house? 

Yeah, harder date last year. would even harder hospital covid.

Anyway, none relevant things closed quite time.  mentality seems bit strange me. primary reason wore masks prevent unknowingly spreading COVID someone else (given incubation period asymptomatic cases). Given understanding fully vaccinated people basically negligible chance contracting, thus passing COVID, see reason vaccinated continue wearing mask. understand thought likely lot people wearing mask vaccinated point they're affecting care less decide continue propagate amongst also willing get vaccine. can't get vaccinated want different story again, someone who's vaccinated I'm longer potentially threatening people. considerate towards someone working service industry really wearing hat displays awful beliefs  bad idea... honor system ?! Corona likely stick around. never open tiny minority people highly specific health issues? That‚Äôs ridiculous.  never get required level community vaccination insure safety immunocompromised. barely trust myself. 
No. cannot trust people honest. 
I received first shot, got COVID, get second shot coming week. I'm still going wear mask long can. Yeah, that's pretty terrific. keep going finally able end blasted restrictions.  people get vaccinated herd immunity develops, risk drop. lack compassion vulnerable people concerns me‚Ä¶ every man himself, now. Sucks can't vaccinated whatever reason... herd immunity, nowhere near close happening. Let's hope variants gentle. something hidden legit reasons (i.e. ensure safety staff customers) mist ongoing pandemic.

Those cannot get vaccinated isolating &amp; waiting blow definitely wearing mask. structure remains every rung ladder worth X dollars previous one, never escape cycle increasing cost increasing wage.

That's part whole problem.

If everybody's pay goes up, nobody's pay goes up. pay more.

Prune top let undergrowth flourish. Full vaccination takes month. kids never time get fully vaccinated announcement. opening economy time summer.  time super wealthy sleep well night there's mob door remember getting extra Dollar hour made sure change budget cause knew going last. addition, Indian variant (in light dark green) spreading various countries, relative arbitrary. calculate R value percent population vaccinated. That's people talking herd immunity months. actual number. talking that. 

Some states vaccination rates 30% still. near need. doesn‚Äôt matter. vaccinated protected. unvaccinated taking personal risk aren‚Äôt masked. Exact words CDC, Fauci, Biden. jeebus. we‚Äôre finally getting HEB NTX. cant come soon enough. suddenly science changed since april 27th? ""we wont recommend lift mandates take masks daily infections 10,000"". happened that? hmm? suddenly going pretend covid doesnt exist? thing long Covid. Sorry brag, everyone immediate family close friends wanted vaccine end March. stay make appointments online cos hard get. worth it. came across extra vaccine brother dad. ex boyfriend hasn‚Äôt gotten it. That‚Äôs big reason ex. Things decline, huge spike honor. shame. Immunocompromised people nothing new. making push keep people masks stores them? people risk various bacterial viral illness covid.

I'm surprised news you, novel coronavirus far contagious dangerous flu. arm got really bruised swollen bed 2 days 39.5C fever, chills general body pain Yes ask require proof.  hard trust completely admitted deliberately lying us past year, e.g. masks work, coronavirus ""airborne,"" etc. 

I follow make sure steps cautious recommend. Same. can‚Äôt put energy towards caring anymore Every Covid shot free isn‚Äôt gray area. Employers absolutely ask.

HIPAA narrowly tailored law applies way medical institutions handle patient‚Äôs records. Businesses absolutely ask vaccinated, ask proof they‚Äôd prefer. good points, agree you. appreciate logical non-trolling response üòÜ. Hopefully vaccines work out. got vaccination, hell care didnt? o.O safe. done. move on. astoundingly ignorant. least teh vaccines snatched us Australia went good cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

I keed! keed! well!

I wonder antibody titer vaccination. shots strong reaction to. I'd exposed times sick last March, never got infected again. exposure increase immune response. True!  post allowed similar. Sorry post pretty confusing. Meijer good bad? Yeah see too. I‚Äôm like, oh population least likely show symptoms die? also, problem someone else‚Äôs kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated? area requires I‚Äôll still wear mask certain point that‚Äôs parents. thinking. people got Johnson Johnson less protected first dose Moderna. Definitely, I'm upset it. saying sucked! Hope blood stays clot free brother Could well possibility cases continue decline. Yes, random process. AstraZeneca/Oxford &amp; Sputnik vaccine viral vector vaccines, specifically using adenovirus (Oxford chimpanzee virus &amp; Sputnik common cold viruses) modified avoid replication. virus enters cells, releases coding spike protein, body transcribes mRNA, used make spike proteins.

Interestingly, Sputnik vaccine uses different adenovirus depending dose - Ad26 day 1 Ad5 day 21. I'm sure explains efficacy data relative viral vector vaccines, think novel compared vaccines there.

One explanation, though I'm operating limited information, immune systems - using viral vector vaccine - react extent adenovirus used. using different viral vectors, might avoid scenario 2nd dose less effective due body reacting viral vector. There's it, possible explanations, one I've seen.

For combined trial, they're giving AZ dose day 1, day 29 giving Sputnik Ad5 dose. They've also started study mixing AZ vaccine &amp; Pfizer (in order) one mixing Moderna &amp; Novavax. I'm sure specific reasons that, layman's guess would allow flexibility supplies (say instance, hypothetically needed AZ vaccine prime system, Pfizer vaccine 2nd dose big boost efficacy).

There might also studies China mixing doses, I'm entirely sure kept vaccine news there. thing goes India. Can‚Äôt private businesses basically mandate whatever want employees? employees don‚Äôt like quit? Delta announced today employees need vaccinated. also doesn‚Äôt violate HIPPA employer ask vaccination status. Kroger union largely useless. co-opted company supposed protect workers from, shame perpetuates idea unions bad. know they‚Äôre less effective. regardless assume still comfortable going wearing them. you‚Äôre less comfortable going unmasked vaccine that‚Äôs way effective. shows you‚Äôre using science data come conclusions. want COVID risk 0 happy 0.05% risk infection even lower risk death serious issue vaccine. wish best hoping 0 risk rest world moving regardless. Science prevailed CDCs policy business rightfully accept policies return normal.   closed War 1812

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vaccinated matter. ones suffer consequences mask mandates removed choose vaccinate. Right, that's problem. wearing mask vaccination really protect you, get others keep masking many vaccinated. Unions corrupted companies they're supposed protect workers from. would sneeze though. research showing immune response second dose better 12 weeks first dose rather 4 weeks second dose. doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre protected interval first second shot though. think misinterpreted that. 

The 3-4 interval used Pfizer Moderna meant give best protection *as quickly possible*. sense, 4 week interval still makes sense.  Costco. asked worker defensive adamant happening. Maybe informed yet think shocked Costco first. 100% dependent Kroger go to. Like Kroger does/has none this. That‚Äôs immune system works. I‚Äôm shocked people would think differently both. 

The science clear vaccinated greatly reduces risk catching *and transmitting* virus. new CDC guidance clear vaccinated enjoy benefit.

And course aware lot people either opposed getting vaccine entirely haven‚Äôt properly motivated yet. They‚Äôll never convince antivax, basically wake-up call haven‚Äôt motivated yet, sort works carrot stick. 

- Carrot: vaccine allow return normal life. 

- Stick: You‚Äôre surrounded unmasked antivaxers, better get protected get infected.  want to, correct totally agree. Breakthrough case data tracked CDC shows .007% among fully vaccinated people. those, tiny percent hospitalized. greater chance struck lightning. That's actually super inefficient. really composting them, growing vegetables compost. Covid effect son. Jesus christ still spread virus even vaccinated right? actually ""trusting experts"", statistics throwing wrong. Masks MUCH less effective protecting seem Schools specifically listed. Problem numbers dropping people getting vaccinated. lot people want get have. They'll still lazy get it, fear factor spikes again.

It's like telling teenager homework allowed hang friends. teenager lies homework goes hang friends anyway. worked wearing mask months would honestly forget even on. Cope Fuckin Libertarians man... &amp;#x200B;

Disney know, like remembering bring fucking wallet. inconvenience oh God society can't continue way! think it‚Äôs incredible responsibility. don‚Äôt think defining reality responsibility way takes away it. actually adds it. also think it‚Äôs semantics. It‚Äôs reality job whether name not. wish named could tie bonuses incentives _that_ instead shareholder value. Top CEO‚Äôs definitely valuable, majority C-suite replaceable. gap value added value received pretty wide average CEO.  long term effects parents irrationally freak get proven wrong? special place hell CEO. love Kroger, CEO, much. list places refuse shop getting exhausting, luckily includes 1 Meyers shops occasionally way home work. get medical exemption it? WalMart cant force share medical information. want avoid lawsuit costs imo. Annnnnd go. There‚Äôs going another wave, folks. We‚Äôre even 50% national vaccinations everyone‚Äôs declaring ‚Äúfuck it.‚Äù CDC created monster regard consequence. realize according CDC, flu causes hospitalizations/deaths covid them, right? close one...glad vaccines helped Michigan flatten curve. Yeah

I thought major flub part caused friction needed Fauci explain everything right gate since public trust 

Going many hours announcing Fauci weighing let lot toxicity misinformation vaccines work spread words he's lazy learn use it.

I understand stupid people get old too, old people suck tech they're lazy stubborn cases confusing figure out. correct. problem unvaccinated use cover go maskless well. everyone get vaccine yet. there's lot know long term effects covid younger people. definitely seen serious stuff like cardiac damage young athletes. probably eua vaccinating young kids around September. hard wear mask months? Yep that's incentive I'd like see. practice doubt it'd reeeally work without strong language. compensation level stock / equity. Tax capital gains! Pain, swelling cool extremity, may paleness  skin decreased pulses. Sudden chest pain shortness breath could blood clot lung life-threatening emergency Right. I‚Äôm curious retail worker. weird thing know wasn‚Äôt vaccinated casual conversation. people haven‚Äôt vaccinated ones probably want stop wearing first. Unless hazard pay fraction cent per hour, completely base - Kroger 400k employees all. mean still wear mask want. Even then, risk kids still incredibly low wouldn‚Äôt worry it. Statistically kid 20x likely die car accident covid 8x likely drown. could happen it‚Äôs point worrying doesn‚Äôt make sense logically speaking. Lol ‚ÄúI see deeper argument others make argument‚Äù coming guy initially completely missed point. You‚Äôre special sunshine, finally clued in. many people would worried catching it, gotten vaccinated though? San Francisco think youll OK.  people follow rules without enforcement. lot people wearing masks stores required them, even though stores punish people follow rules, rule-breakers. Hazard pay due covid America vaccine available everywhere assholes willing take 

I got 12 14 year old vaccinated Pfizer yesterday Indiana 

No side effects This. many people thread pretty much saying ‚Äúf*ck got mine‚Äù cares, fact, look profiles they‚Äôre anti maskers, people also small kids home point massive %age population India vaccinated, making claims one article misleading best. Reason lot poor ppl counted statistics there's still vaccine hesitancy amongst poor. 

The stats even remotely representative entire covid story anywhere india.. They're behind me, they?... paying 50% tax working CVS.

I guarantee it. Ralphs associate here. hours got cut beginning pandemic. hazard pay ended, hours got cut again. made 3 years ago minimum wage lower. hour cuts bad department barely functions. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Probably items get stocked empty shelves cost less paying someone fill them. I‚Äôm downplaying COVID-19, however remember virus movie something like 30% death rate symptoms horrible. didn‚Äôt seem like asymptomatic mild symptoms. do. haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet aren‚Äôt hard core anti-vaxers. good chunk fence procrastinating hassle. may nudge move buns. bummed it‚Äôs happening NJ honestly. transmit vaccinated person, nonetheless. It‚Äôs possible unlikely point cannot build policy around it. Law order indeed. favor stay away r/coronavirusmichigan. mad rescinded mask mandates.   latest report estimates 12.9 per cent UK children aged 2 11, 14.5 per cent children aged 12 16, still symptoms five weeks first infection. 

Hmm pretty wild, weirdly give reference numbers collected. wonder refer symptomatic cases. seen major issue states kept schools open, example. numbers really high, schools would full kids long term side effects, something off. QFC shut 15th Ave Seattle, despite always busy. Cheapskates Thiiiiis. Ugh. appreciate edit change viewpoint I‚Äôd like pitch 600k - 950k figures much closer CEO pay used 50‚Äôs 60‚Äôs, relative worker pay. 1965 21x typical worker company (not lowest paid).

So really that‚Äôs like way things used be, CEO pay exploded past 30-40 years; it‚Äôs 293x typical worker, according site (www.epi.org). help feel better. would extremely unlucky get symptomatic covid complete vaccination. numbers us child 17 0. 000113333% chance dying estimated 300 mil people usa  vaccinate kids flu. don‚Äôt think words mean think mean üòÇ  wrong ‚Ä¶and non vaccines 100% effective. risk tolerance low keep wearing mask. probably keep wearing masks then. Yes life back day 0. lie say vaccinated immunocompromised something. going nuts.   chart? Great cant fucking shop Dillons anymore goddamnit dominos

Dominos too?!? /s Disney! Unfortunately know people going (who initially thought COVID big deal). Research back remember, ethical consumption capitalism. Everything sucks. place suck more, suck less, suck least little bit. announced +180 cases today... torch grows dim everyday pitch fork gets dull....... -Governor Murphy. remember considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks getting vaccinated order give vaccine time kick in. Also congratz! fact, cut discount. would much palatable government paid extra $4/hr instead mandating businesses large businesses typically offer benefits local mom pop shops (are workers facing less risk?). eviction moratorium - landlords supposed pay bills/mortgages? hoping herd immunity, they‚Äôve conceded it‚Äôs unlikely Kroger also performed well across board. good store keeping shelves stocked goods. Provided COVID vaccine shots state. Continues well positioned supply essentials across America.

Kroger also paid bonus eligible rank-and-file (think meat manager, store manager, corporate managers) something like 200% planned bonus. like good year Kroger employee, better influence business outcomes.

(I dont work Kroger, live Cincinnati Kroger HQ is. know employees happy pay pandemic) theme park outdoors anyway, won‚Äôt much hassle put one go indoor areas. Probably referring Fred Meyer, owned Kroger (and coincidentally like Meijer terms size store sorts stuff sell) give kids flu shots. kick ass-cure!!! Yeah got PhD molecular genetics past year I‚Äôve realized love immunology didn‚Äôt know about. I‚Äôve trying figure transition vaccine research past months, it‚Äôs hard resume sequencing microbiology related, don‚Äôt want go back post-doc. would funny happens, variant emerging country people could get vaccines, world going back lockdown mask think better use vaccine young healthy adults nearly zero chance suffer covid. think interesting talk GA TX ""peeing pool"" - now, obviously low death rate.

But look states shut hard. Mine (IL), we're GA deaths/capita well TX. Oregon started reopening *before* state did. There's clearly long states shut down, convenient say otherwise.

Fair enough numbers, though. I'm glad least go something mind. We'll likely range within two three weeks - 5/100k would 16k. We're currently 35k cases/day dropping thousand 7 day average every day.

But thing making difference vaccinations (and prior infections, smaller extent), make mistake. Several states removed mask mandates since we've vaccines, we're still lower real infections probably point year. That's vaccinations. sell short. problem CEOs getting paid ""commensurate responsibility"" still get paid even completely fail job. want get paid handsomely company's success leadership, also partake suffering comes company flounders leadership. no, get golden parachute.  either incredibly naive God-tier troll can‚Äôt tell is... Unfortunately, $22 CEO gets headlines disgusting. failed said rest ~$900M yearly savings goes investors. CEO getting 2% cut. That's CEO's investor class it. Pfffftttt‚Ä¶..You still get pregnant birth control too. second two weeks up, masks going straight trash never touched again. Time get back raw dogging life! Absolutely!!! Unfortunately governor (NJ)!thinks knows bit CDC says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre yet‚Äù sweat eyeballs serving soup.  interesting.

I'm seriously interested company require proof vaccination vaccination without violating HIPAA (One P can't spell correctly) sounds like case waiting go Supreme Court. 

And yes, understand exceptions sounds entirely like code honor point lifted everyone.  point looks terrible morally indefensible time coming week likely going Cali MAYBE New York real mask mandates left

So much elephants claims goverment would make everyone mask forever Agree BlOoD cLoTs ThO!1

/s that‚Äôs states deciding. many people die death certificate? Unfortunately BS, Google ""kids long COVID"" look primary research well known need sources. One coworkers daughter going it, fatigue headache symptoms lasted since last July. gone half dozen doctors, labs show abnormalities, idea do. become publicized understood last months widespread is, even though knew possible early similar chronic fatigue syndrome type effects come mono.  Well take first mask still second one duh lol Dude idk going on, outside Trader Joe's feels like produce companies taken huge downgrade last 6-8 years. Follow Science. Trust Experts!

No! like that!! Temperature checks theater. don‚Äôt anything stop covid.  Man, almost can't trust huge corporation days! J&amp;J. Early April. fact wanted back =/= now. means. Lmfao

Yes outdoors. WITHIN 6 FEET PEOPLE TIME. 

You've got ride queues, shops, food, parades, character meet greats (either socially distant person)

Doesn't matter outside prior change. 

And exact reason 27th trip WDW paid already January 2022.



I know disney parks pretty well crowd levels people bunch up. argument going ‚Äúwell vaccines prevent hospitalizations severe illness. ‚Äú didn‚Äôt live like fucking hermit ‚Äúnot go hospital.‚Äù GET COVID PERIOD. shut people don‚Äôt want covid real. would surprised there's basically nowhere mask policy/mandate left 4th July CDC waved huge green flag 

I think plan lead Biden declaring victory epidemic independence day speech assume everyone sick given ratio antivaxers would lie maliciously. I‚Äôve symptomatic vaccine 8 months Lol companies never gave fuck you‚Äôre less comfortable going unmasked vaccine that‚Äôs way effective. shows you‚Äôre using science data come conclusions. want COVID risk 0

Now putting words mouth, never said this. 

Maybe paying attention I'm particularly concerned myself. I'm concerned people can't get vaccinated. science data shows people put risk unvaccinated wear masks, even wearing masks. Home transmission happens virus gets home. Meaning someone contracted somewhere else. Reduce/eliminate somewhere else spread won‚Äôt home transmission. Elitist assume everyone privileges do. Something like 35% Americans vaccinated 50% first dose. Something like 30% Americans already infected. intersection cannot possibly 1-1. We've reached form herd immunity. over. really think lot people claim mask awhile quietly stop masking within month. exception parents unvaccinated children people work it‚Äôs still required/recommended work subsidiary CVS. Cvs gave us three covid bonuses, $300, direct deposit paychecks, taxed. Everyone got $150 taxes less. really think motivate anyone get vaccine? ones resisted majority anti-maskers along. honestly count wear mask now? It‚Äôs honor code system won‚Äôt following it. ask 12-year-old medical issues 57-year-old health-care worker takes care Covid patients every day get vaccinated, answer clear, right? calculus change health worker different country?

Quoted [this WTF think it‚Äôs still county waiting 70% drop full thing Them: ""Masks never politicized!"" 


Also them: ""I'll keep wearing mask look like Republican"". Honestly I‚Äôve heard friends work places, seems like good gig compared most. know going end. businesses away masks, others aren't. prepared influx angry antimasker videos. Well, no, A) metal attracts lightning, B) wouldn‚Äôt able spread lightning others struck, there. They're probably people insisted happy mask up. enough to. No, *enjoy* wearing one selfish something. get it. love analysis daily jabs Canada, read everyday! got infected vaccines came whatever. already seen elephant survived. great sorrow, BiL also not.

If vaccines come month two earlier would still bet. person passes free 99% lifesaving vaccine because...reasons...is idiot book. people listening constant medical advice vaccinated? point level vaccine availability they're people listening constant medical advice wear mask, social distance, pandemic even real.

So yeah, care people made worse first place. one showed nothing minor symptoms. $40 month, $40 year. $13M equity one stock likely hold year sell.  Yikes? Look, wearing face coverings year half. mind, trivial so. bunch masks. really hard.

I keep cases low, people vaccinated feel comfortable it.

COVID massive pandemic. think reasonable hesitant stop following one simple, basic, public health measures face coverings. Nah Krogers great huge disconnect leadership bottom rung. Well one person died, it‚Äôs 100%. people know, divided evenly among Krogers 453,000 employees, pay would give everyone $49 Hi! I'm one people. (eligible mid-april, got mid-april, moderna). I'm happy happening - two weeks left FLY by. chances catching outdoors, I'm masked distancing, already incredibly low, plus growing immunity every day. Yes, ""waiting turn"" sucked times, expectation others would reward so. shit like really pisses people bottom treated horribly. Appears good show tests = cases working more? problem ‚Äúkill rich‚Äù argument - let‚Äôs call exactly is, even pseudo-civil ‚Äúflavorful‚Äù language - killing rich doesn‚Äôt actually solve anything. makes different people rich. 

Additionally - cannot believe say - **if incentivize moving up, nobody going move up**. America. So, wanna reamed genuinely asking question. CDC article says: 

That fully vaccinated person walk grocery store even unvaccinated unmasked shoppers safe.

So push ""only vaccinated people unmask"" instill people get vaccinated? 

I'm asking know someone unvaccinated, vaccinated friends refuse room always thought unvaccinated person concerned around vaccinated people since they're saying still spread even vaccine. 

So someone wanna vaccinated, based safety vaccinated, shouldnt everyone masks want? Seems crazy considering target demographic can't get vaccine. would run publicly traded company ground CEO.  100% enforceable... wonder fall/winter surge. vaccination protects well chance actually manage catch COVID vaccinated degree actually spread it. aren‚Äôt vaccinated point that‚Äôs prerogative it‚Äôs sweat back. Yeah, anti-vaxxers insane. exactly really small amount protein made arm suddenly get respiratory tract ""shed"".

*That's virus does! complete virus replicates....*

The entire point mRNA vaccine get enough mRNA make spike protein. Nothing else. that. CT Gov said mask mandate would lifted May 19th three states lifting capacities indoor outdoor stores restaurants etc. Murthy said weeks don‚Äôt think Cuomo said anything yet. already worried enough get it, going suddenly make it. I‚Äôm looking golden idea. can‚Äôt one coming good ideas. golden idea? Yeah

OP either lying managed literal million-to-one shot. Bout time ‚úäüèΩ Yeah

Some ""extended cleaning protocol"" implement truthfully stuff pandemic not. take class 5 global outbreak wipe counters couple times day. can't round 100%. specific connotation. something 100% effective death, one die it. actually look world think world developed western nations. 

India tragedy alone might get us close last years losses. 

Usa/europe/china world. Richer nations might seeing light end tunnel poorer countries lack better words getting f*cked. problem unvaccinated use cover go maskless well.

They already along. Wearing mask noses hanging supporting probably eua vaccinating young kids around September.

I 14 year old relative getting first shot tomorrow monday least. 11 year old brother get soon government approves shortly.

The time science deniers get vaccinated! 

We cannot continue years waiting idiots read conspiracy crap covid vaccines, Bill Gates 5G FaceBook! hard wear mask months?

Why ask nobody internet CDC, Fauci, scientists medical people saying fine drop masking vaccinated? went Wal Mart today ready go without mask literally everyone else one on. want get yelled put on. Maybe couple days starts set in. NY/NJ/Connecticut usually work unison. Probably coordinating message govs probably wants get political points announcing press conference instead twitter.  muh TrIcKlE eCoNoMiCs!!!!! Agreed, I'd put high doses corticosteroids top list. already [case reports early Covid Iran pointing risks, long history prior cases mucormycosis (also known zygomycosis) associated corticosteroid use [4](http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=747), 

I've read may possible issue way Indian hospitals humidify supplemental oxygen, bubbling vessels water (which hopefully sterile). seems equally possible (as outsider) family members providing much necessary care Indian context bringing environment them. soil fungus *Rhizopus sp*. molds responsible literally everywhere, tough keep every wall, floor vent bleached regular basis. Kroger also shut stores rather pay hazard pay.

Fuck Kroger. system believe would allow things feel safe? wonder quickly drop price. imagine much stock one thought mask mandates would end abruptly Actually, remarking fact **I don‚Äôt blindly follow talking points without putting critical thought I‚Äôm following first**. Like ~~some~~ roughly 98% you. find confidently saying you‚Äôre 2%, you‚Äôre wrong, 2% know question everything read depth true value blind repetition, therefore constantly question knowledge. 

The problem everyone every side equation vast majority simply idea you‚Äôre supporting why. might right, might wrong, whatever is, you‚Äôre reasons control paid attention. Want proof applies almost universally? Two party system, basically coin flip every four years. Reagan 1984 last time anyone‚Äôs gotten 55% vote. Nearly 40 years coin flipping right wrong literally **NOBODY** fucking country pays god damn lick attention god damn thing. either side did, law averages would dictate coin flip population would reduced equivalent amount individuals, elections would ridiculously lopsided. they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre coin flip, pay attention. 

I put thought sufficient thought principle commenting. Shortly commenting, realized incorrect initial line though, self-corrected. can‚Äôt deal that, can‚Äôt help you. Kids 12 20x likely die car crash COVID. They're clearances much be. saw sale Target buy one, get one 50% off. 50% point least  Believe CDC tell mask up, believe tell mask down. 

All friends family vaxxed (that outside children). We're excited move back normalcy. Massachusetts think you‚Äôre right otherwise Gross. Oh we‚Äôre using statistics reduce fear? Lmao past year half. know two friends friend groups know got covid, neither gotten vaccine plan (as yet, could change mind guess). boggles mind someone 22.7 million dollars, presumably MUCH that, continue work. made even fraction that, I'd instantly retire nice modest comfortable, peaceful existence. Time read *Capital*! get option 5G chip. It‚Äôs available Italy. perhaps us care well unfortunate people poorer countries.  money, want money. OK good job me! Something interesting McMullen started Kroger career sales floor. case slew heads line

So fault infrastructure provided doses people able use them, doses ought wasted rather used somebody eager vaccinated going beyond following COVID protection measures whole year? Taking consideration fact eligibility requirements least small extent arbitrary, given everyone individual circumstances taken account simple age/vocation/broad health history check? Thanks info. Got second 8 hr ago, arm pain far‚Ä¶ Kids can't get vaccine Disney implementing device guests link vaccine cards magic bands. band doesn‚Äôt linked remove mask Mickey Mouse caging front everyone town square calling liar get vaccine, I'll never die? That‚Äôs best argument lifting mask mandates now, agree it‚Äôs simply stupid require masks elementary schools kids vaccinated.

For rest society though, political reality every day, people done pandemic, numbers actually starting agree that. Trials young children going complete least fall, way even liberal states maintain widespread mandates long. Anyone get run horse Kentucky derby.  Tbf said could‚Äôve announced months earlier knew unvaccinated people wouldn‚Äôt listen. announcement made knowing one wear mask anymore, won‚Äôt cause detrimental damage 800x bootstraps mean point I‚Äôm going ‚Äúassume‚Äù anything lol. I‚Äôve careful year want certain shit. Good thing rig self-checkout bunch cheaper/ free stuff every time shop there... Maybe cause experienced first hand don‚Äôt want experience again? don‚Äôt know... see argument higher numbers national average. 

Also, 70% disproportionate... much line numbers seeing. 

Finally, end number calculation needs reflect got sick died.

Hence, put estimate 3 10 million. agree first comment post? inevitably get infected, vaccine not. 

(i got pfizer jabs btw.) We‚Äôve literally kept kids school away peers relatives year. logic, wouldn‚Äôt indicate Covid actually way dangerous kids flu? vaccine roll reason sure! politics aside, honest question. everyone starts going maskless, ""vaccinated"" people still get spread covid mean viral loads going skyrocket people become ill, especially shot? raise chances mutations? might illegal sure feels immoral. want lie thats them. Let deal consequences. Im fully vaccinated, family fully vaccinated, let live life. Virtually people socially yet still killing 700+ people day. plummet soon. far plummets I'm sure hopefully along lines Israel UK months 8 year old 3 times likely drown die covid. isn‚Äôt rationale reason keep restrictions. Stay inside ‚ù§ Things miss DC:
Trader Joe‚Äôs 
Things don‚Äôt miss:
Harris Fucking Teeter‚Äôs Boulder employees families doing? floats characters it. 

And even said meet greats. People still group there. Lmfao arguing facts?

And that's works.... Ohio still mandate 2 days. long term effects catching covid vaccinated ""break through"" infection?

There never 100% guaranteed never ever ever get covid vaccine. real vaccines straight performing miracles though. Look headlines country around world!

But never 100%! flu vaccine vaccine AFAIK. shutdown society that, get cases acceptable level, get life.

The happening covid-19. new thing. looked data kids handled vaccine well trial

Also 12 isn‚Äôt allowed September, time get data feel sounds like compassionate person. us move slower change, maybe rug pulled past maybe he‚Äôs extra cautious. anything, missed point. That‚Äôs response pointed repetitive. What‚Äôs point? think indoors longer issue Disney heat anyway that‚Äôs taken care got back Costco WA several workers without masks. allowed. wish brethren would. Alas, it‚Äôs awful lonely straight white conservative Christian-identifying male actually heart mind towards needs others.  

We deserve right live peace, deserve live decent living exchange honest day‚Äôs work.  Another state government following science.  ""quote"" wish study Pfizer/Moderna mix

I know UK study mixing combination focus Let's clear 2 dollar hour raise 5888 full time people entire year Why? Lifting mandates takes less minute. Remove signs door. Done.
 
Any business requires time 'consider guidance' anti-science assuming know infectious diseases CDC practically every state health organization. Something company culture I'm guessing, I'll flat guarantee employees care much soon punch out, clock ones around strict it. ‚Äúnear‚Äù elaborate ""consideration new timeline"" part please? donate charity cash register grocery stores. corporations could end hunger without help, instead go helicopter skiing. summer sub unusually gung ho AZ vaccine, issued numerous vaguely worded press releases promising interim trial results. 

While reality, based Italian data, achieved 100% protection death. much promising trial results!

Of course, right think AZ using PR boost vaccine would logically impossible companies use PR undermine it. one other.  live Malaysia, recently there's official news people risk covid death ages 50-64, apparently lower global average. rollout AstraZeneca's vaccines country (she's yet vaccinated), church planning group vaccination event members could sign up.

But course, father thinks covid ""bad flu"" he's worried would get blood clots AZ vaccine, eventhough he's worried us ending ICU covid. Oh 5000 people died covid within ages 20-29 (where lie)? ""Nah son fine, need wear stupid masks"". Nice backwards-ass thinking. Welcome fucking life. here.   Yeah

Soon US drops Israel numbers per capita need turn focus putting much manpower helping countries pandemic TBH, boss‚Äôs boss definitely fuck-all (seriously teams confer Happy Hours try figure hell actually day) I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs making least 200k. dream shoes... ...So saying functions?

-management, probably Well else get latest yacht? Personally would've waited drop mask mandates 1st July. Vaccinations open general public month now. think gives enough time people actually wanted vaccine get 2nd shots two weeks after. I've wanted since beginning got 2nd shot week. Lol, BC residents even allowed take Ferry unless essential travel. We're little ahead game yet. Walmart gave back problems new hate general public. really weird considering openly confrontational already gotten door guard shot death crazy anti-masker chain That‚Äôs Seattle though. technically ‚Äúthe government‚Äù say ‚Äúthe government‚Äù without specific people assume mean Feds. yup California. Mask usage dropped like overnight. Im kidding-it plunged 75% literally 10%.  don‚Äôt get vaccines kids. unbiased source different vaccine offered especially vaccine advice use/whom use case allergy (would like look list). 

Unfortunately dad stroke/seizure issues mom though ok, hospitalised multiple times allergy reactions low blood pressure issues. feel sibling eager vaccinate whole fam mentioned wait research first due health history. fair would've done 22.4 MILLION üôÑ vaccination status? country?  i'm paid ever, less ever job. imagine disparity becomes even exponential get higher food chain. child get vax I'm changing masking behavior. sister bf low symptom asymptomatic covid vaccinated. everything I'm going risk infecting kid imbalance right now. Richer highly vaccinated countries(US,Canada,EU) ending pandemic poorer lowly vaccinated countries (India, LATAM, Bangladesh,Nepal) getting pounded. Hope vaccination ramps heavily India next 6 months odds mother dying coronavirus catches it? 62 years old year hypertension. I'm worried her. Menards mandating masks 2030 rate, ones area still head counts capacity hunt people mask centimeter bridge nose. Got shot morning. twelve hours post shot achy. Woke body aches gone felt fine thought clear 20 hours post shot fever ‚Äúhangover headache‚Äù lasted till 30 hours post shot. took Tylenol 28h though it‚Äôs possible would felt nothing took Tylenol sooner. 

By second morning felt completely fine arm pain way less first shot. Wasn‚Äôt bad thought Moderna. People know Pfizer way less symptoms though ones like four hours.  11 week gap. choice, due medical reasons.

I'd really like get test check antibodies  awesome news. saying thing am; can't address people. free pass expose others without show cheating inconsiderate. Complete agreement. kind odd seeing top sub starting fill 'Good News' posts, great refreshing way.

As America, Canada wealthy nations begin recover start return sense normal, really hope become lackadaisical happening areas world.

If anything, think double triple-down get vaccines every corner globe. Even nations oppose us geopolitically. Vaccinating world noble effort needs treated effort empathy toward humanity.

Even costs substantial tax money, need this. Ugg agreed. mom young kids, feel way. 

So even I‚Äôve worked hard train young kids wear masks (mine bit older yours) won‚Äôt taking places. won‚Äôt trusting adults around maskless truly vaccinated. 

I understand many ready ditch mask, hard right now, everyone eligible vaccine yet. idk somehow reminds yet sad reality pandemic shown ‚ÄúMe first‚Äù culture. CNN's Dr. Gupta said good sign people infected 2003 SARS coronavirus still strong protection 18 years later.

He said one Q&amp;A videos CNN remember one. anyone would leave comment would appreciate it.  Eat rich! misinterpreted man, he‚Äôs side say eat rich. Fucking hell. feel way immunocompromised people pandemic? mandate flu shot too, ya know? scaled btw. middle manager bonus amazing average joe. I'm sure boss puts mine shame. really climb ladder scheme.

That said, bonus based company profitability can't move needle that. yay.  There's special place hell. Aldi No. Reddit thinks people extremely stupid Goodbye.  Awful, amazon something similar cut worker's covid-19 hazard pay upper management ceo pocket difference? Guess im shopping anymore. üíØ ‚ù§Ô∏è  Hawaii still seems moving ahead creating something vaccine verification enter state, lieu providing negative test. They're danger themselves. CDC says NPR article: vaccinated individual walking grocery store unmasked unvaccinated individuals safe. 

It's personal choice vaccinated except risk. want kind policing force asking people submit papers saying vaccinated? Hmmm infinite land. infinite resources. technology extraterrestrial resource extraction think really bank that. capital infinite, everyone would would value. 

Also, something 100 years ago, make infinite. toilet paper 100 years ago, already agreed, finite resource.

And everyone keep acting like wealth comes where. Billion dollar companies got exploiting labor like done article. take child beach? risk shark attack higher risk you‚Äôre describing. Hope 30 like Pfizer seems knock people way less  crushing it!  ""Grocery Employee Hazard Pay - LaborStandards | seattle.gov"" mayor pulled mask requirements vaccinated individuals city including county facilities. made statements reinforcing masking requirement even three days ago. crazy quick happened happy. don‚Äôt anti vaccine vaccine skeptical lingering conspiracy-theory back brain attention span look vaccine information 10 seconds.

I know people like this.   Also shifts pressure away retail employees confront anti-maskers messaging shifts one personal responsibility ""if dumb enough go unmasked refusing vaccine that's problem"" 

Pending companies prompt removing mask rules clearly ignored signs along border said ""CLOSED!"". rude them, things considered. Yes, however, 65% population age 35. vaccinations carried 45. Therefore, large proportion vulnerable vaccinated. fuck reason vaccinated I'm soooooo glad quit job Deli clerk Nov 2020 shitty Kroger Company. Fck Kroger said confidence must true. probably going pick wearing mask winter commute protects face/germs. so, glad deal swampy, summer humidity. So‚Ä¶ know better CDC? you‚Äôve got unique information, I‚Äôd recommend share them. wanna star ya? take \* Discount wine enthusiast moms make solid *two-buck-chunk* anti-vaxxers article bizarre.

The concept parents asking advice unvaccinated children. idea behind query everyone maskless, unvaccinated children exposed it?

But instead article says parents unvaccinated children go maskless. them, kid. whole time told masks protecting others. article written voice protect you.

At rate, disagree CDC guidance, pointing article practically worthless. What? No, that‚Äôs all. don‚Äôt problem anyone got vaccine early even criteria eligibility bit iffy, it‚Äôs definitely good let doses go waste. I‚Äôm saying millions Americans patiently waited eligibility open adult vulnerable people could get vaccinated first, aren‚Äôt really taken consideration new timeline.

At end day, it‚Äôs probably huge deal, seems bit inconsiderate. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmandate,‚Äù quotes. States can‚Äôt actually tell business require customers wears masks. That‚Äôs legal. Never been, never be. made better one future would still able get it? think surge weeks one way another- that's potential worry Fall-Winter. real indicator revision guidelines works vaccinations actually increase next weeks. Yall getting HAZARD PAY? I‚Äôm Memphis, decent sized metro area. Kroger dominates grocery market here, depending live, either drive long way give shop grocery store nearby - Kroger. one time, Schnuck‚Äôs here, coincidentally, Schnuck‚Äôs decide pull Memphis time Kroger pulled Cincinnati. even bought other‚Äôs old stores. Purely coincidental, though.  Epidemiologists Expected Mask-Wearing Public Least Year wording bad messaging 

The pandemic may slowing US, Canada, Europe flipside utterly decimating counties strained infrastructure like India

The warning nations need pitch help countries discussing issue entirely separate issue hand. We‚Äôre talking earned compensation, congressional testimony. Keep bullshit unless you‚Äôre ready actually address issue we‚Äôre discussing. Taiwan actually one highest testing rates per confirmed case, 4th VN, NZ Australia. think CEO could affect revenue 0.05%? That's increase required $15M change market cap, based Kroger's metrics (4.7x EBITDA Market Cap). would justify difference compensation $20M/yr CEO $5M/yr CEO.

You're right hard measure direct impact, knowing minor differences justify difference, massive companies, always want mitigate risk going expensive / capable person? enforcement, they're using honor system, honor system caused 33 million cases, 580,000 deaths. I've never vaccine adult covid. vaccinator chatted relax me, watch (didn't even watch either pick needle) barely felt first (and second slightly more). think looks scarier feels. Vaccinations everywhere slow everybody opportunity get shot. demand still greater supply, every province opened appointments Pfizer 12+ everything 18+

Like said, first dose rate carry end May that‚Äôs article says. It‚Äôs good news perspective that‚Äôs said said Good News.. shows side much America full thinking people can‚Äôt free. whole time?  They're dropping restrictions unvaccinated people. percentage people vaccinated anything this? smart take Tylenol taking johnson johnson? Going bed soon side affects slowly starting. Wondered take sleep literally reached ceiling. Got density black hole going thread.  It‚Äôs mostly paranoia though. Even severe Covid cases studies showing things clear up. idea mild asymptomatic cases suddenly going
To cause severe lung damage years line paranoia sold media outlets trying get clicks. I‚Äôm nyt reading liberal person def lost respect mainstream outlets bit pandemic selling fear wayyyyy much. Yup. friend mine worked company 10 years took home $10 million bonus increased profitability $100 million. essentially got 10% cut company. 

But - big BUT: professional services firm janitors secretaries making $25/hour. capacity number test performed per day Taiwan? Taiwan 180\*1000 test per day positive rate 0.1% percent yesterday? Lots people know singed soon eligible still waiting dose 2. supposed shop groceries go work unvavcinnated unmasked people running free wait ""fully vaccinated"" 2-4 weeks left? takes work. assuming becomes something unlimited supply must easy get? logic doesn‚Äôt hold up. 

Listen, commented originally implied idea capital/wealth finite obvious thing. want point another perspective doesn‚Äôt see way. would cool see general consensus among economist experts. would trust academia limited understanding. don‚Äôt deny anyone performing skilled task deserves minimum $25 hour, even 2021 dollars I‚Äôm sure someone actually 18 bagging groceries college needs deserves $25 hourly.

Why not? EVERY percentage specific connotation I‚Äôm taking advice CDC virologist‚Äôs quote New York Times.

You‚Äôre talking door knobs. banned suggesting April 2020 preventing people fishing boats (while allowing fishing docks) waste time would effect COVID Taiwan ramp chip production case? semiconductor industry makes huge amounts money Taiwan, leverage US since dependent US arms exports. think going big diplomatic dustup Taiwan US either vaccines chips. CDC probably considered fact know even single dose highly effective. CDC also knows people got COVID high levels immunity. 

The messaging ""fully"" vaccinated 2 weeks post 2nd dose that's good reach maximum protection. get data, ""fully"" vaccinated immune people walking around. on/off switch gets flipped 2 weeks 2nd dose. high percentage people 2-3 weeks post first dose also high levels protection well people already COVID.

When factor in, country whole pretty high level immunity now. know trust news.... looking forward attending convention October hopes finally free masking social distancing. someone (who thankfully part con staff) told masks social distancing never going away every October-April yearly cons like permanently. seriously hope happen, would huge slap face worked hard end crisis. mean, I'm people want choose mask flu season cold something (and would sick), mandatory time lot people vaccinated much threat COVID surge anymore. see he's coming from. learn Kroger this, I'm going look shopping elsewhere. Disgusting business practices. üò§ Corporations sued shareholders don‚Äôt enough maximize profits. Basically means heartless decisions corporations make US incentivized system heartless. practically people get vaccine health issues, making wide scale public policy fit *very* small group can't makes sense. Everyone get vaccine tomorrow. availability outpaces demand.  paid money lives. reason moderna Pfizer made phase III trails fast outbreak got bad US. No.

No fucking way send doctors, nurses, military, public health officials countries.

They‚Äôve fight hard past year half, it‚Äôs absurd send developing nations getting crushed again, let heal bit.

Shipping vaccines, N95‚Äôs, O2 generators, remdesivir, steroids, absolutely, one medical worker military member, it‚Äôs much. Guess wear forever then. Lifers Kroger really old union contracts, usually, actually earn living wage decently taken care of. Anybody recent contracts constantly steamrolled company union. It‚Äôs joke hired certain year lowest risk covid I've never liked needles (although I'm scared less older get). I've lots allergies week - itchy nose, scratchy throat - actually thought day, would take getting pinched, even massive arm soreness 24 hour fatigue COVID vaccine shots gave me, spending days weeks even minor symptoms typical cold/allergies, knowing long clear up.

I'm *that* old yet, used think getting flu shot every year worth it, considering infrequently I've gotten flu life. getting COVID vaccine, I'm starting think compared feeling getting sick (again, even disease *isn't* threatening life), I'd much rather suffer brief discomfort getting shot. fell it? lot jurisdictions organizations tied mask rules CDC guidances. I'm betting thought CDC would change guidance May 2022 week. You‚Äôre ignoring part chance needing hospitalization even contracting covid vaccine nearly 0. Right vaccine supply exceeding demand someone decides lie vaccinated contract covid thats them, me. Yes small population people immune compromised actually can‚Äôt vaccinated. Unfortunately may never time safe sure take many extra precautions possible. scientists amazing.

FTFY. get enough credit this. Yeah threw money issue, money buy much. Would like cite sources? Numerous studies show exact opposite saying. 115 million fully vaccinated people, 223 people died COVID-19. sure significant amount immunocompromised individuals sample. Trump still president, would getting flack ""pushing"" CDC lift mask mandate. Biden, hear narrative thrown around today. that's completely fine! Take time want team would benefit slower transition. CDC state governments outlaw masks preventative measures, simply removed advice they're necessary.

You're completely free maintain mask requirements long want, reason anyone needed provide forewarning change.
 
It change fact, however, ignoring guidance provided organization FAR qualifications resources make determination.

Edit: damn autocorrect. mean, think wearing masks biggest nuisance past year, means things pretty nice family compared people actually affected. Id report store tbh. Also targets company policy still require masks create infinite wealth time without stealing anyone else, ask money do. good time strike. IIRC US head start, managed secure vaccines per capita EU. Numerous studies show vaccines protect people Kroger: can‚Äôt keep little grocery store town open even though closes we‚Äôre turning area food desert. Figure out, sweaty

Also Kroger: Oh pOoR cEo CaN‚Äôt AfFoRd nEw YaChT qUiCk GiVe mOnEy!!!!!

Edit: format need vaccinated. Trump still president, would getting flack ""pushing"" CDC lift mask mandate. Biden, hear narrative thrown around today. U.S. already shipped Pfizer vaccines Canada since two weeks ago Biden wanted borders open much guys do. would vaccinated lie about? NovaVax make EUA happens get manufacturing ramped up. AZ probably going bother US point. everyone vaccinated even chance get vaccinated. there's people severe health issues cant get it, need everyone else vaccinated protect vulnerable general issues masks right now.
1) lot southern states already removed mask mandates seeing COVID spikes.
2) Vaccines incredibly effective. They're effective vaccines ever made.
3) Inflation starting spike, politicians worried COVID stimulus unemployment part that.
4) Public health messaging awful throughout whole pandemic. 
5) Biden wants win continue advance agenda.
 
I think important issue thee CDC's mask recommendations weaponized them. lot people, including Trevor Noah, criticized CDC messaging. Even Dr. Fauci said CDC conservative. CDC's speech impending doom March help either. CDC's new mask mandate, they're removing line fire speak.

None policy decisions ideal, ideal world, we'd tie non-pharmaceutical interventions meaningful science based metrics. However, never chance interventions going political, coupled awful public health messaging whole pandemic, sounded end restrictions.

Look fast Newsom California changed attitude restrictions went recall. lot governors reelection next year, want voted face coverings. Young kids never needed wear masks. According Paul Offit, top vaccine expert, kids like 5/6 even ACE2 receptors covid uses get cells. Dude magician never reveals trick! context discussion assumed infinite meant limit much exist.

If really want technical yeah, finite amount energy universe could use say nothing truly infinite. that‚Äôs clearly we‚Äôre talking here.

Wealth isn‚Äôt zero sum. put labor ingenuity something becomes valuable, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean I‚Äôve taken value away somewhere else. create wealth without steal anyone else. effectively that. political way it. fine think time lift mask mandates yes communities seem refusing take Vaccine ultimately come back bite continue see outbreaks. mask awhile longer public buildings despite fully vaccinated. resources used create wealth change time. wealth created natural resources, creative resources, energy resources. combination things used create wealth infinite, least proposes discussion.
 
The hundreds billions dollars wealth created Amazon, Google Microsoft exist forty years ago. created. happen again. again. again. vaccinated previously virus, another Coronavirus. I.e cold. Move life. Cool check enforce vaccinated not? Well Us gov (and japanese/german) ask Taiwan ramp chips car industry so‚Ä¶ yeah give something demanding   WDW masked temps upper 80s, lower 90s. Sucked balls, roll it. wish they‚Äôd mask line Agreed. still wearing mask indoors while. We're still guinea pigs great vaccines big help, still feels like early celebrate victory. Well. I'll go shop elsewhere. Elsewhere may shining pinnacle greatness, Kroger, either. saw that! think universals approach fair, requiring masks inside. Negligence means nurse failed excecise appropriate degree care providing nursing services. Sure. point given lack system makes sense lot places like libraries, etc continue requiring masks--not doubt CDC know everyone vaccinated. Scientists actually still studying right now. know people stay immune COVID least 8-12 months. However, virus mutates time, may need boosters. may end like either flu shots tetanus shots - it‚Äôs recommended get booster every 5 years. Vaccine year, vaccine last year...

You‚Äôre comparing apples oranges, you‚Äôre comparing apples kangaroos... anti vax family ended getting vaccinated still toting conspiracy fb. Also rural red town saw lots trump stickers getting vaccine think think Exactly. Phase 2 people haven‚Äôt even chance get fully vaccinated yet several states, it‚Äôs irresponsible grocery stores start letting people come maskless‚Ä¶ Lmfao. Comments Reddit posts ""Scholarly articles"".

You're hysterical.  get people get vaccinated. understand logic here. go get vaccine, takes 15 minutes. refuse one cares happens you. Trust experts. Trust science. Like 1000 kids died Coivd nationwide, millions millions cases. 40% US vaccinated. No. isn‚Äôt way prove who‚Äôs vaccinated hasn‚Äôt outside basically taping card shirt.


After week 2 certain companies eventually away masks people opportunities go indoors maskless, thought who‚Äôs vaccinated isn‚Äôt afterthought Kids die covid far lower rates seasonal influenza, giving vaccines developing countries instead vaccinating children lead highest possible amount lives saved; really cared people's lives would agree it, rather thousands brown poor people africa india dying kid life ""saved"" developed country blame you, we're humans emphatic like us cares liars there? shit people everyday spreading special brand poison...it stop world turning. society move forward. 

I submit people worried liars really annoyed bc feel like unvaccinated people getting unearned free pass back society...irritated bypassed hoops get back normal. want wear mask protect cold, feel free...

The rest us suffered 14 months people afraid...we shouldn‚Äôt wait longer...  even admits he's expert. Quote comment history:

""I'm medical professional work research opinion opinion like everyone else (though scientifically informed average). "" Yup don‚Äôt. Buddy, it‚Äôs like doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs like everywhere. I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúthe news‚Äù. I‚Äôm talking people looking studies public opinion. Relax. Costco did, first. Yes ends we've defeated Covid. (much ww2 ended we'd defeated thing)  businesses handle this? enforce it? businesses even ask proof vaccination, honor system?

My workplace currently requires staff wear masks inside outside, guests wear masks inside. knows why. ok thx, one last thing.

Is shot like flu shot get every year life? Like vaccines get birth. important point damaging information ability fight disease. studied lab got literally matter easily could started lab since animal illness everywhere. thing bolster conspiracy theorists people distrust authorities. thoughts non CA residents vaccinated? going suck leaving kid gate father go in.  Hey! It‚Äôs normal feel little leery getting preventative medicine like this. couple quick facts vaccine:

1. They‚Äôve tested highly regulated clinical trials, hundreds thousands volunteers. safe effective trials. 

2. They‚Äôve administered hundreds millions people around world (between different types vaccine). 

3. common, severe side effects known, year scrutiny study. 

4. They‚Äôll significantly cut chance catching, spreading, becoming severely ill COVID. current crop vaccines effective vaccines ever developed. 

Out hundreds millions people mentioned, genetic changes diseases recorded due vaccine. 

The real ‚Äúcon‚Äù potential feel bit ill 1-2 days vaccine. opinion, that‚Äôs small price pay never get severe COVID!   vaccines work. we'd failed find effective vaccine, zero covid approach NPI would way (in sense, vaccination achieves exactly - bringing Rf 1 Covid dies out).  IHME:  That‚Äôs thought first point even new variants popping up, vaccine dominated variants (unless got Astrazenaca RIP), kinda CDC saying it‚Äôs ok go maskless even they‚Äôre around dumb people unvaxxed masked Walmart already planning this, beginning 18th. live, think wait 24th per state mandate.  


Either way, WAY early. doubt top salaries super inflated. arguing can't pay employees more. let's hold paying employees simply choose to. matter CEO super rich employees also fairly compensated.  Look, went TJ's soon fully vaccinated masks plus vaccine meant safe enough bring home high risk husband gets 2nd shot next week (and soon eligible checking availability every damn day, several times day kiddo likely high risk young shot.

When masks mandated indoors, places enforce shop there. mask rule, antibacterial, covid flu people,and everyone get people wear masks.

I guess back online shopping again. No, they'll lie. like beautiful dream, reality. felt good long time. America‚Äôs test bunny

This odd phrase, it? Usually I'd use ""guinea pig"" kind context. one death means conservatives say ‚ÄúAZ doesn‚Äôt even save lives.‚Äù went local hospitals walk clinic. hospital property associated hospital. point hoping Halloween. want celebrate holiday bit normally son. makes Happy! Everyone immediate family least first shot. Half people work well. fact vaccines far worked even better expected means start getting things back 'normal' much quicker ever thought would happen!   though? follow science not? Immunity wane. Like current viruses rotation. don‚Äôt get flu 5 years finally you‚Äôre gunna get hit hard. you‚Äôve never experienced flu get that‚Äôs gunna problem hospital level

Not looking immunity virus introducing body catch don‚Äôt go hospital. believe qualifies low-quality response.  would incorrect though, said factually accurate. looks like floodgates opening tide turning Oh get wrong. care people. people aren‚Äôt completely selfish like antivaxxers are. don‚Äôt care public well-being, care you? wouldn‚Äôt me. 

They‚Äôre gonna get sick regardless. There‚Äôs hundreds millions interact time. going bit catch catch bit I'm going keep mask handy car required. Walmart masks Target requires them. HyVee understanding still requiring employees wear customers. Zoo longer requires masks libraries do. I'm going go flow. happy finally reached point. No, can't, wealth finite resource like toilet paper. Someone else making/hoarding lot money prevent getting any.  them. Germany like 35M citizens Spain girl...  That‚Äôs big old pass. 

England tried force reopening saw infection rates triple week. We‚Äôre heading direction. exception March April 2020, never stand line went TJs 7pm. Consistently low attendance hour made easy shop. feel pretty horrible say kind think believe unless get COVID get sick anyway. really lost sympathy people take minor inconvience discomfort common good good.  


I hate tempting karma even thinking saying it, maybe point really believing karma willifully mallicously ingnorant.  CDC‚Äôs job provide guidance. CDC wanted waited let‚Äôs say August tell us this, vaccinated people would upset rightfully so. means like 6 months haven‚Äôt told us life safe resume without masks indoors could largely frustrating people waited cdc give heads safe not. kids feel sorry mask hope best. seems CDC appealing adults vaccinated point, make significant amount population That's like saying virus surge India concern rest world.

Literally every world leader said concerned. Look. 

You want government say true things. I. 

You want true things leave people true beliefs. I. 

You said possible say true things leave people false beliefs. - root entire conversation. 

So what's fucking problem?

If think specific instance example miscommunication, that's whole different conversation one putting writing. actually wrote accuse asking government lie. Even though I'm asking *you* want. 

Or least wanted five hours ago, looped back around saying matter *what* government says, ""some always misunderstand anything."" therefore - lying omission matter? lying omission *exist?* otherwise, things someone says affect many people understand they're saying, say things maximize number. signatories different opinion likelihood. It‚Äôs political statement scientific advancement- fact published Sciencemag names Lipsitch Baric sending ripples scientific political communities. 

Boring stuff, important moment still think. No, ever. It‚Äôll depend individual‚Äôs risk assessment number cases decreases. 

Currently county averaging 2 cases per 100,000 people/day. Depending condition personal willingness accept risk, even vulnerable people may choose unmask carry (pre-COVID) life.

Maybe number high‚Ä¶then wear mask and/or continue avoid high risk places.

The point everyone decide considering situation risk assessment. prefer leave personal decisions mandates. Get vaccine, protect loved ones. Enough dying??

You understand lockdowns implemented? appreciate fas cism means? sounds frightening, especially pleurisy. also can‚Äôt believe people self-righteous comes masks. suppose safety / normalcy type thing. I‚Äôm Asia, seems pretty common air quality issues also courtesy, believe. 

I wish good health ordeal had. üíì hell talking staying isolated? one here. point people may may line shot every year. that's truly find, I'll go get every year, can't assume immunity wanes like clockwork fickle beast that, ends protecting longer would anyone get shot every year?  get people understand this. hard work last year going lost.  week two ago, still metering customer entry lines wrapped around store. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see people don‚Äôt know laws mandates Cool rest bloated management, next 4 highly compensated employees $4 million. 

I get point inequity mind boggling good one except super rich. kidding me? one even already freaking hypothetical *next* pandemic? nice follow CDC guidelines people carry vaccine cards prove wear mask? Seems easier wear mask, like mask harms anything. Also hear lot people refuse stop wearing mask even vaccinated sure much actually matters.  I'm scheduled get Jonson vaccine tomorrow second thoughts 
im 23 healthy-ish guy (30ib overweight) kinda want wait year getting dont know. 
I feel wait year could come better vaccine something 


p.s really dont understand cons getting vaccine thats worries me, sure genetic issue something develop (not trying sound crazy dont understand guess) Suddenly every WalMart customer ""vaccinated."" Especially ones conditions let wear masks. would they? Vaccines work. Unvaccinated people wearing mask pose threat anyone themselves. wouldn‚Äôt surprise never reached 70%. goals different. people upset now?  gonna lie, may something.  Exactly, probably waited certain threshold population vaxxed announcement, even people lie shouldn‚Äôt issue. Anti vaxxers may lie, likely get sick, hospitals least able handle least staff protected. see

this trader joes lady

those anti-vaxx wine ladies going extinct since became meme share frustrations, definitely. I'm skeptical vaccine blitz seen UK US mean reopen borders quickly they'd like. best, think means start enjoy freedoms daily life AU NZ months now.

The best placed countries eliminated virus home get population vaxxed. we're yet, looking like end month, anyone able go corner store get free COVID vaccine walk-in.

B.1.1.7 variant doesn‚Äôt appear cause severe illness kids, even United Kingdom, vast majority young people contract variant experience mild symptoms.

From Healthline.

Anyways though want mentality drive kids anywhere much likely die car accident. Yeah, no.  appreciate least threshold. people saying things like idea would actually make feel safe, that's I'm asking about. 

That said, assume vaccinated? vaccines *really good* - like, better vaccines almost every disease. certainly alone concern, risk really extremely extremely low point. Likely lower many risks routinely take without thinking. Source ‚Äúmajority epidemiologists reacting wait, wtf‚Äù Center Disease Control Prevention epidemiologists recommendation?  Potatoe potatoh Except kids 12 cant even get vaccine, distancing masks help protect them. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt get it, means you‚Äôll probably less severe case. lung problems two people live with, well two serious medical issues. People like us could still end needing hospitalization. There‚Äôs also issues long covid, 30-40% people suffer. Maybe research things wonder learn. Lol cares, get vaccinated concern Several states didn‚Äôt open vaccine eligibility adults April 15-19. Even got first dose within first week eligibility, got Moderna, still wouldn‚Äôt received second dose. 

Since basically mean end mask mandates entirely (i.e. real plans vaccine verification), timeline bit disrespectful people actually waited turn didn‚Äôt jump line actually eligible.

I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt really seen discussed all.  wondering same, like businesses really gonna ask every single person enters got vaccinated? let whoever in? Yeah case projections accurate last 14 months Fas cism prioritizes state economy people. 

Lockdowns response pandemics diametrically opposed fas cism. lot hospitals doctors offices ask mask sick. signs boxes masks usually near hand sanitizer station, especially flu season. I‚Äôm hoping people follow now. 50% population completely unvaccinated - zero shots. I‚Äôm getting 2nd dose Tuesday. I‚Äôm supposed wait 3 weeks. I‚Äôm certainly going need groceries time. 

Which means I‚Äôm looking around policy info several stores, hoping least one reasonable. Maybe curbside something  Lmao ok cuomo sure thing bud Pandemic usually means epidemic ocurring several countries continents. 
Pandemic can't yet. argue epidemic might U.S (although there's lot new cases yet high death now, sure that) makes perfect sense. Costco makes everything simple. wear mask, corona.

You things Covid underlines dependent other, little real control really lives. really afraid of. Good I'm glad agree something. care significant portion human population remains unvaccinated virus time opportunity mutate further. further. further. opinions contradictory best experts field, no, side science. mean, it‚Äôs said vaccines anywhere 85-97% effective protecting symptomatic infection.

I would assume includes ‚Äúlong‚Äù symptoms. Ehhh, wearing mask, likely vaccinated paranoid. yell them, would say they're dumb. right wear one; also right dumb lot accusations cover SARS China well. 

However finding host intermediary host, likely would extremely important beneficial part process China itself. would tell virus started transferred population

There would reason hid stop finding natural reservoir COVID necessary stop infections happening. fact still large hunt find host intermediary host, lot initial reports blaming pangolins, turned true.

But longer takes, makes people wonder even host/intermediary host. help support lab leak hypothesis.  Maybe know they're covid incident rate roof pandemic Well point do.

They're keeping people hospital, they're preventing people infecting others. things great evidence proving that. tough year deserve faith. Things looking good right now.

3. Whatever gets shots there. Many companies businesses already offering huge bonuses incentives get shots. governments already things like WV give $100 savings bond, Ohio get chance win $1million government. plenty people vehemently vaccines nothing convince them. India 190 covid deaths per 1 million population. (now) steady 4000 deaths day equivalent 1000 US deaths per day. twisted way, outbreak nearly bad may seem. Oh definitely carrot circumstance. also scientific approach. science supports low risk vaccinated communities likely intended motivoation low vaccinated areas get vaccinated. Wohoo! I'm happy you! Let guess. Asymptomatic? someone honor his/her neighbor enough get vaccinated, rest assured dishonor applies telling falsehoods avoid mask.

It's entirely predictable. also virus December reads like movie book review. Literally positive thing I‚Äôve read vaccines far. It‚Äôs really cynical. Dr. Fauci said element incentivization this. Listen Biden Walensky it‚Äôs all: you‚Äôre vaccinated can....

Ok darling good luck knowing vaccinated never going persuade hardcore anti-vaxxers. hopefully persuade vaccine hesitant/vaccine procrastinators take COVID-19 seriously, relying mask wearing social distancing feel safe. coming end, maybe push need finally get vaccine. swear people grasping straws keep everything masked restricted. wishful thinking. want vaccinated it. behavioral precedent all. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

""could mean"" 

in six months.. they're getting COVID 2.0

and US world's biggest do-over.... vaccines funded,

10 authorized use world.

there are

fifteen currently Phase 2/3

and DOZENS MORE

in Phase paid 3 4. already sick ‚Äúthe unvaccinated going lie vaccinated don‚Äôt wear mask‚Äù talking point already. 

News flash: people weren‚Äôt wearing masks begin nothing changes far concerned. Guess what? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated don‚Äôt give two shits people do. want wear mask so, nobody going stop you. 

The superiority complex people regard masks reached comedic levels. goes sides argument. Fuck July 4th. Memorial Day insane. ""muh freedom"" shit getting old now.

You realize that, now, percentage population cannot get vaccine SIGNIFICANTLY lower percentage go schedule appointment right?

So...whos really holding back ""freedoms""?

Or, admit muh freedom crap really work valid criticism anymore CDC, state governments, vaccine producers saying safe get back normal... lol, saw highest daily toll at... 25 infections. 

Idk even worth it. Taiwan rich enough country afford buy vaccines next coming months. Imagine devastate local restaurant/bar industry turns end vaccinating people high enough pace keep infections bay regardless? 

If hundred infections, would get it. 25 infections. So, point, masks essentially required. really would fine immunity-compromised allergic population vaccine work. understanding HIPPa. Lie harsh judgmental term.  Call strategic distortion... sound like car experts saying vaccinated people safe risk not. without mask unsafe everyone around you. I‚Äôm seeing 31... Exactly thoughts. Except people say getting vaccine masks arguing bad faith.  would still wear mask even vaccinated till end year. im happy things opening people need remember viruses mutate vaccinated people might immune new strains. you‚Äôre top floor building pic. Damn dominos falling quicker thought. Lfg Yes. really annoying last year personally Papa Nurgle loves us all. bruh careful states like CA...June 15th mask mandates going away. going able go stores apparently? I'm thinking science subjugated manipulation behavior...   Lmao get downvoted this, completely correct. insane. panels top experts CDC naive - *very* cautious. precise statistics they've constantly surveying vax uptake sentiment. know close approximation many anti-vaxxers certainly estimated many might mask - they've determined even (plus margin error), safe dropped virtually restrictions nationwide.  see name always think Gul Dakot. Like random Star Trek reference made? people suck wont get vaccinated. Get it. Covid here, get loved ones vaxxed soon go enjoy life. 

Myself... Ima go ballroom dancing!! wants ‚Äúwin.‚Äù Yei!!!! total agreement one places actually enforced masks door, feel less safe shopping there. Unfortunately Alabama, masking hit miss (mostly miss) anywhere outside areas Birmingham I've trying part. family vaxxed friends too...I'm tired carrying load fellow neighbors tired protecting themselves. may sit shopping trips consolidate I'm kinda interested seeing next weeks shape see many cases increase since I'm sure it'll 'look' like we'll 95% vaccination rates shoppers. CDC would change guidance thought would immediately raise r like 1.5 ""rip"" study: 


94% efficacy hospitalization, mention deaths far tell. Everytime there's outbreak blamed new infectious variant.

While dont doubt truth that, variants similar. dont believe Indian variant much infectious.

The rise infections often really people governments let guard wrong moment. 

India Britain prime examples that. Brittain relaxed early December, India definitely let guard too. Part problem even current vaccinated rates, absolute number people vaccinated US right 3x Canada's whole population. 

Also case numbers decreasing, absolute number daily new cases US still quite high. nothing theoretical that. mechanism retrovirus luke HIV. 

Let make clear vaccine alter DNA. I'll always keep one case business requires later feel need wear one particular situation. easily fit back pocket bag huge deal one person whenever I'm about. 1. Southern states helped immensely climate. outdoors equals less time stuck closer quarters, less opportunity circulated air infect others.

2. vaccines helping, people want 100% effective. conflicting messages helping.

3. Wutchu talkin bout, fireraptor? Politicians love giving stims (particularly ones start D) raising taxes compensate.

4. 1000% agreed. political sides.

5. See #4. also media helping him, unlike 45.

6. Trevor Noah busy slamming 45 care CDC says, let's real.

7. CDC is, design, conservative. order gen pop giant, cancer stricken lard asses.

8. March's speech was, IMO, political get 45 out, necessary. media gave ammo it. Honestly, I'm surprised 46 gone even conservative CDC. majority revised platform 3/12/20 hit.

9. interventions political humans ones performing them. hate see it, humans run emotion logic disturbing amount time.

10. Nancy's nephew scum. concludes TED talk, thank reading. much: applies Pfizer jab, results given astrazenica jab far biggest jab given uk. don‚Äôt start releasing figures that, I‚Äôm concerned. Trader Joe's highest volume store located Ashland, Oregon one nations lowest vaccination rates. want to? people need time go they've year going back ""normal"". We're different. Viruses infective.

If idiots get infected, still infect others. everyone vaccinated.

Not even everyone wants vaccin vaccinated, vaccinated.

So no, hurting kind certificate show you‚Äôve vaccinated? able get number back problem. majority population motivated. people wanna play mask police Reddit. Thank I'm okay. cant wait hit gym That's terrible, bro. assume took first shot 4 weeks second? people havent wearing masks california while. today, even indoors, would say people werent wearing one. choice AZ wait. picked AZ. Everyone wants vaccine get one. It‚Äôs time move back normal Read source, seems prove right buddy... keep masks long want to. Lmao I‚Äôm confused you. California literally slowest state reopen even make push reopen imo. really sense urgency incentive people get vaccine besides personal want feel hurt state long run. Luckily, college Arizona leave August I‚Äôll headed state take mask outdoors indoors I‚Äôm fully vaccinated :) got Coronavirus. oxygen levels became low. Although given oxygen, make it. men pro athletes many thier 20s course aren‚Äôt bad symptoms live blue area guy verbally harassed covered mouth hands shirt walked him, taking walk outside. ""It's okay man, I'm vaccinated!"" said, walking toward me. ""Yeah, well I'm not!"" said back him.

It's red blue issue. lot people care themselves. stop wearing masks, think need well. them, pandemic over, means needs everybody, regardless reality. Mask-wearing going forward upset peoples' veneer pandemic assholes still wearing masks, responsible prolonging pandemic. Many people overestimate threat COVID, especially young healthy people. They‚Äôve told fear disease changed whole lives it‚Äôs changing again. Change scary people. Give time.  find comical UK Singapore green list countries test vaccinate red list. What‚Äôs vaccination level Singapore? vaccine used? ID number

... yet Yes. you‚Äôve heard AZ vaccine , I‚Äôd recommend googling VITT find answers. It‚Äôs everywhere. particular Canada decided stop distributing first shot people ‚Äòout abundance caution‚Äô. countries pulled ‚Ä¶ much bad press Pfizer moderna. Article quotes Murphy saying couple times, ""we're yet"" (but could matter weeks). Would bit credible give tangible metric ""there"" (case rates, fatality rates, vaccine uptake, etc) vaccine never pushed promoted something going completely protect someone infection. It‚Äôs clear vaccine supposed minimize severe illness importantly death, stop hospitals overwhelmed. That‚Äôs plan along.

That's I'm frustrated by. People forgotten (or choose ignore) plan. They've shifted focus pure case numbers and, them, cases bad. Take Yankees situation: yes, vaccinated people got cases. one mildly symptomatic. big deal! That's literally vaccines supposed do, people freaking cases. number cases pretty much meaningless point since hospitals longer risk overwhelmed. Ding! Ding! Ding! winner!

This it. That‚Äôs hope CDC issuing this, think. Let‚Äôs hope works. Thank you, charge morality, I‚Äôll deliver news new declaration masses. Yes. think could important developing countries Africa South America gonna get vaccines next. Europe USA think it‚Äôs bit late everyone able get within next month anyways looked 2018-19 Flu season appears 480 children died. article said 90 children died covid. period time start pandemic around March 2020 August 2020. could done flu usually sticks around 4 months. decided compare covid deaths similar time frame. dont agree covid certainly year round threat time frame covid deaths children mostly pulled school. Also many restrictions place like social distancing mask wearing stretch time. children put close proximity unvaccinated whole school year could definitely seem much higher death rates covid get flu. Apparently spread happened like airline prostitute place people wanting admit went one. Ok  Fantastic, BSing indication fully vaccinated people EU able travel US again? see reason delaying I'm ready dump euros American tourism industry soon got second shot. It‚Äôs really great sign, actually, since 7 8 completely asymptomatic 8th extremely mild symptoms. kind good news story. means even Chinese vaccine turns covid cold most. Nothing official yet. Hopefully soon...

Currently look www.prullenbakvaccin.nl unofficial site set GP's vaccinating excess AstraZeneca vaccines unvaccinated adults. see locations nearby check site regularly see vaccines available. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely can‚Äôt get enough workers everyone sitting home unemployment‚Äù. - Republican liklihood getting Covid probably higher liklihood loony toon coming Wally World, keep wearing mask. What, then, would constitute hard evidence you? one high risk kid well, know exactly mean. Guess get stay locked still vaccinations approved kids ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah fact original comment got upvoted disturbing can. want show proof wear mask assume vaccinated. pretty simple really.

No store going though. Businesses want employees (And yes, courts already cases ruled can) situations like cruise ships airplanes might decide worth requiring, nobody gonna prove vaccination status walking Wal Mart Target. Thank God insurance companies. Studies show US coverage virus overwhelmingly negative compared countries people MASSIVELY overestimated hospitalization rate. 

People drive mad fear that‚Äôs pushed them. Nobody saying need shutdowns, keeping mask mandates place indoors children opportunity get vaccinated seem unreasonable. clearly society prioritize children. Good thing i‚Äôm apart 36%. Normal never left me, enjoy pessimist internet though. must fun parties actually get invited to! people want us wear mask every last fucking person gets vaccinated? world expect? go back normal lives point. many states nearing 70% adults vaccinated, scientists CDC changing advice, let go fear. kid die. can't get vaccinated, guidance literally says still wear mask. update much later say people finally wear masks too. Chicken tender course. going lie whether dropped masking requirement today year now. started limiting hospitalizations hit overrun system. 

Then somewhere along way became ‚Äúthe case number must zero‚Äù think acknowledgment risk children extremely small. CDC cautious guidance, aren‚Äôt ignoring children point acceptable amount risk never zero. ignoring there's plenty anti-vaxxers anti-maskers walking around maskless since there's nobody checking. Pretty much this. Source: german. Eh, point pressure everything think it‚Äôll drop pretty fast. Functionally isn‚Äôt huge difference 70% adult population getting vaccinated 60%.  point trying make adults (even non-parents) responsibilities like driving drunk protect everyone society (including always limited children), you‚Äôre looking laws specifically affect children like mentioned don‚Äôt sell tobacco children, hell don‚Äôt even allow advertising tobacco children. pregnant wife can't get vaccinated.

The vaccines recommended pregnant women. tiny chance side effect causes issue thousands times less chance complications due COVID. hunch feeling potentially right isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúevidence‚Äù. precautionary principle face virus would dictate leaving measures place spread largely eliminated. Key West pretty strict making sure people masked up. PA 50-60%. Monroe Lehigh counties. Vaccines sitting unused storage. lot people opting wait see vaccine due pretty baseless fears speed development. get make choice: vaccinate enter unmasked world unvaccinated. like move, forces people‚Äôs hand.

Don‚Äôt want get Covid? Go get one free vaccines widely available wear N95 masks, also widely available. hundred infections, would get it. 25 infections.

One day later, gone 180 new  states following new masking guidelines also eliminating social distancing rules per CDC guidance? key thing nightlife allows packed bars, nightclubs theaters. Yeah, time last year outdoor mask compliance PA 60-70% rough eyeballed estimate. agree you, it‚Äôs 10%. I'd willing bet Massachusetts. Despite ""repub"", Baker gone super hard masks restrictions. restrictive mandate country. far know, last stated total reopen date August 1st. Boston tacking additional 3 weeks that.

In addition lean pretty left whole see bunch people stating wanna get seen ""other side"" take masks off. pure virtue signalling maddening. public demand mandate getting rescinded high states. Baker probably feels sit awhile get larger scale backlash. relief right? still mask required places quickly going away. TBH never felt safe wearing mask anyway sure now!

Real soon thing past. :) realize 3 year old unlikely experience worst outcomes catching it,

Yeah, get callous society choosing kids. Death possible outcome besides, told 1 100,000 chance kid dieing I'd still taking seriously. You‚Äôre ignoring fact vaccinated adults make transmission kids unlikely. really wonder means says opening isn‚Äôt imminent. mean won‚Äôt happen month, summer, year? Pennsylvania announced mask mandate apply vaccinated individuals 2 hours announced new guidance. 

With states still ‚Äúreviewing CDC guidance‚Äù, say I‚Äôm pretty impressed quickly PA acted this. believe already written something automatically modified mandate apply vaccinated people CDC released guidance directing so. 

It's past tense yet. Cases still higher started wearing masks first place. There's reason normalizing thousands deaths every week requiring vaccinations keeping guard couple months longer would driven eerything orders magnitude. Health experts tend disagree. enough itself, something. Thanks perspective. also agree shutting wide-ranging precautions right move last year.

Since science become clear, landscape shifted. We're place year ago, guidelines reflect that. Car chips lucrative profitable phone computer chips. making car chips bc US/german car industry already fucked already Biden/Merkel asked Taiwan See, ‚Äúthere‚Äù CDC says there.

Murphy doesn‚Äôt get make call. Scientists do.

Funny ‚Äúpro science‚Äù turning hollow, meaningless political phrase. Well good thing 80% protection week first shot. Also good thing choice wearing mask still feel like need extra protection. 

Yeah, thanks. Excepting course well known science masking vastly effective sick person wearing mask. lot protect others protect yourself, around unmasked, unvaccinated that's problem. politicized topic leaving honor system irresponsible, even since even wait long enough largest age group cleared vaccinated.

Don't go telling ""**You** make sure get vaccinated...""

**I** fucking did. morning first day possible. I'm given time fully effective.

This government's plan, see everyone wanted vaccine chance kick lifting restrictions. 

I'm lifting restrictions, jumping gun. scared woke crying I'm overwhelmed information. good way! I'm vaccinated I'm excited. news water wet kettle also black. Diabetes, type 1 too... work (retail) tells we‚Äôre fully vaccinated go without masks. Covid March I‚Äôm currently waiting 2nd vaccine shot. I‚Äôm still gonna wear mask then, go without it, safe would be? I‚Äôm wondering too, go jersey lot. I‚Äôm Hudson Valley, wondering NY well. agree you. child old enough start vaccinated. don‚Äôt expect entire world remain shut prevent getting virus that, likelihood, would minor. Instead, continue wear masks two weeks second vaccination shot.

I believe shutting things taking precautions across society, especially mask wearing, right move. many vulnerable people could saved limiting community spread. people vaccinated, opportunity vaccinated, access adequate PPE (N95 masks). understood it, two goals shut downs mask mandates flatten curve prevent overwhelming healthcare system protect extremely vulnerable: older folks comorbidities. goals realized much going be.

Somehow intent shut downs mask mandates morphed people‚Äôs minds ‚Äúeliminate virus‚Äú. never realistic possibility, goal. We‚Äôve protected healthcare infrastructure vulnerable, it‚Äôs time start taking individual precautions person deems warranted move life. Personally, think anti-mask anti-vaccine crowd bunch selfish assholes. won‚Äôt shed tear start swapping virus amongst vaccinated people watch. Best available data suggest people true asymptomatic (as opposed pre-symptomatic) extremely bad spreading.

For example, study /r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/ looked 3410 close contacts reported asymptomatic cases infected 0.3% close contacts. ""The secondary attack rate increased severity index cases, 0.3% (CI, 0.0 1.0%) asymptomatic 3.3% (CI, 1.8% 4.8%) mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% 6.8%) moderate, 6.2% (CI, 3.2% 9.1%) severe critical meta-analysis household transmission, reported asymptomatic case infected 0.7% household members, compared 17% symptomatic cases.

Those studies natural infections, reason think vaccine mediated asymptomatic cases would riskier. anything, viral load lower. absolutely get done scheduled third round NHL playoffs guarantee it.  Nobody saying things place, think point things lifted already lifted vaccine eligible children 12. I'm afraid kids dying Covid. I'm afraid complete lack data long term negative effects Covid infection. personally, knowing everything power cause harm another powerful choice

Exactly, whole ""Well hide home then"" response pisses I'm lots things, I'm running back bars heading crowded gym. there's lots things - like going Wal-Mart - totally comfortable people masked I'm way less comfortable aren't. way knowing people vaccinated, experience last year made clear people likely ditch mask say vaccinated also people likely superspreading. [People vaccinated Covid-19 go without masks indoors outdoors, CDC scientists medical experts saying. think lot people simply still acting emotion rather logic. stressful year many it‚Äôs hard suddenly stop worrying it. There‚Äôs never anything like lifetime we‚Äôre inundated constant discussion illness, case counts, death counts, horror stories, etc. treated flu amount energy every year (not should!), I‚Äôm sure many would similar fears. People slowly get back normal, it‚Äôs emotional challenge first, that‚Äôs ok. vaccine can‚Äôt necessarily cure deep rooted anxiety this, even science behind basically reduces actual risk next nothing. It‚Äôs two days, cool jets. People year. Even could, would allowed to?
Before Covid, anyone wearing mask could expect cops show up.
Will become common now? go back normal.

We fashionable masks now, easily see many people including wearing mask. fever sucks Michigan, businesses must make ‚Äúgood faith effort‚Äù make sure unvaccinated people wear masks, per new mask order.

To count ‚Äúgood faith effort,‚Äù business three options: Put signs say unvaccinated people must still wear masks, ask customers vaccinated (or exemption) simply require everybody wear masks. inline CDC advice. CDC says vaccinated, there's need mask. Colorado says thing, like Biden said, honor system thing. like we're going around stopping people street asking see maskless card. That's remotely realistic.

The beauty vaccine shifts least collective responsibility individual. Individuals largely safe without masks, unvaccinated people putting danger except cases, that's decision.

It's perfect. children can't vaccinated 12, order stays place schools. Scientifically *is* benefit wearing masks, vaccinated not. vaccinated folks unlikely die covid give others mean they're going give receive number aeresolized communicable ailments like flu, colds, etc. CDC pretty whole pandemic. lost respect bad botched pandemic.

My biggest issue Thursday completely undercut business city/county/state trying err side caution. messaging terrible. Yeah really get panic mask requirements dropped. seen many shoppers employees stores last year noses totally uncovered using mask chin strap. mention nutcases screaming poor soul working minimum wages given responsibility law enforcement zero power backup.

Thank God risk lives anymore stock shelves Walmart! curious schools remote offices mostly remote big effect flu stopped. least worked office second someone brought flu (which usually got school aged child) spread quickly office. Masks obviously helped stop think combo masks/remote school work solely masks numbers higher NFL running back sit season side effects, NBA player use inhaler games he's breathing issues.. that's always works. least year people wearing mask also wearing around chins, noses, etc. suppose CDC could've said ""for next 2 weeks, mask mouth, we'll see letting show *whole* face"". NYC last summer might near 75% past week 50% would generous. live PA outdoor masks might hit 10%‚Ä¶.maybe. worries! presented belief fact without checking first. I've done I've called well :D Yes article clearly recognises split it‚Äôs focussed weak efficacy Sinopharm preventing infection, true - has, real world trials, 50% efficacy unlike AZ significantly higher - note quoted cases prevented severe infection. People‚Äôs understanding vaccine fucked, it‚Äôs number 1 job prevent serious disease, UK clearly explained clinician jab/by government/by press idk messaging clear everywhere else. agree, don‚Äôt think anyone say closing schools year, locking large parts country, printing trillions dollars, undertaking unprecedented vaccine effort amounts ignoring saying oh well.  really going safe? autoimmune disease gotten vaccine. autoimmune disease isn‚Äôt allowing vaccination? RA. agree respecting rights parents cautious. would disagree that? thoughts Jersey lift mask mandate? Well Indians Australian citizenship? people haven‚Äôt vaccinated ones probably want stop wearing first.

Going forward assumption anyone wearing mask vaccinated anyone wearing mask vaccinated. Amazing much trust Americans citizens knowing many dumb fuck. 
I like joke,  
How know unmasked shopper vaccinated? ..... ask election That's fair, risk related wearing mask outside vaccinated. That's risk comes getting vaccinated. Totally important concern, I'm talking about. Maybe I'm missing somehting many australians India begin with? One would think global travel even current Indian outbreak kind moronic nove do. That‚Äôs think happen too. prediction Friday Memorial Day weekend, remaining mask mandates social distancing dropped since point, anyone wants vaccine walk get one.

On July 4th, Biden declares ‚ÄúIndependence COVID‚Äù encourages everyone fun safe summer. that‚Äôs true all. collect health info times various reasons. must stored separately employment files (fun fact, turn obituary bereavement leave, goes medical file might say relative died genetic disorder info could used discriminate you)

Additionally, healthcare providers insurance companies bound HIPAA, employers schools instance specifically excluded (we guidelines follow). still beginning COVID. spreading humans 18 months so. Many people exposed. become endemic - like flu. years now, continue compare covid deaths across time 12 month subset flu deaths? compare flu deaths across time COVID deaths? time period arbitrary. Nether fair comparison. point made headline well. worth reading article. states people general able get jab 1-1.5+ months, know common is. fair. Well could said Brazil, South Africa, Italy, US, UK China past. another ‚Äòepicentre‚Äô next. want pandemic end much anyone seems like wishful thinking Paywalled. content paywall make main point: true death toll COVID-19 much higher official numbers, estimate approximately 10 million. Going maskless indoors public unvaccinated better analogue drunk driving imo WTG Spain! Why? It‚Äôs additional piece clothing. think it‚Äôs deranged people like wearing shirt? Socks? pants? hats? wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù list clothing items doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt now. Wearing mask time definitely makes sense many clothing items. say way, instead making incorrect statement nothing back up. 

Here‚Äôs idea. it‚Äôs impossible tell bad covid yet, let‚Äôs respect rights reasonableness parents cautious young kids catching it. Yes opened excuse. another month two excuse either.

The variants worry countries. efficacy proven variants, cautious. understand you‚Äôre saying also laws killing kids... it‚Äôs like ignore say oh well. Yay! Thanks part! üëç Murphy leadership state legislature said yesterday Public Health Emergency allowed expire June 13. would think mask mandate gone time probably even before. That's fair, certain amount people allowed get vaccine very, small number. risk posed interacting people without mask times COVID always exist them, given immunocompromised general. Everyone wearing mask benefit option, I'm sure doctors recommended alternate ways protecting themselves, like immunocompromised people wearing masks public. That's problem goes far beyond COVID.  Also link explains people certain conditions susceptible effects coronavirus. didn‚Äôt think people still questioning this. People getting vaccinated COULD OPEN. we're completely open, one see need. Nothing requiring either. large company requiring vaccine. services requiring vaccine. There's absolutely need anyone fence get now.

Maybe covid spikes control come winter see maybe happening they'll go 'oh yeah, still thing!' went Walmart maybe June July last year saw many customers employees wearing masks nose chin left think many states outside southeast 70%. Nope available Home Depot regularly Half nose hanging out, using mask chin supporter LOL

They drop act go full stupid, effect family now. Babies immune systems aren‚Äôt great begin covid aside, it‚Äôs smart avoid crowded places new baby. B.1.617.2 poor timing. come back bite us. gotten sick year either honestly really care getting colds lmao. would much rather get colds 1-2 times year tops continuing fully interact fellow humans. Plus trouble hearing well masks made even worse me. place I'd want wear masks hospital, maybe airplane that's realize 6/7 symptoms. Zero. None. tested requirement MLB.

Please stop fearmongering.  Yes, wish would given better guidance regard people home cannot vaccinated around go public (should wear mask public). Took long? lol something mindful of. anything always happen. least knowledge powerful prevention maybe Vegas local blown away changes we've seen past day half. Within like 2 hours CDC announcement governor removed mask requirements throughout entire state within 12 hours every single casino Vegas (on strip) dropped mask requirement vaccinated individuals (no checking, 'honor code'). went strip check walked probably dozen casinos, mask leave pocket. I'd say 70% people still wearing masks got glares anyone, literally one cared whether one not. also think everyone knows change cause one lady actually asked masks required since wearing mine, told took immediately. plexiglass dividers gone, craps tables back shoulder shoulder crowds high fiving other, played blackjack hour mask totally allowed (3 people table mask 2 did, again, one cared either way). plus fact big retail stores already implementing changes PLUS fact went $100 blackjack, I'd say May 13th 14th two best days pandemic. go suck twitter :)  wonder huge companies hard time finding help New data recently become available showing vaccines effective preventing illness, significantly reducing ability someone transmit it. is, large, reason CDC changing guidance.

To keep things short, vaccines extremely effective. effective, fact, CDC, Biden administration, nearly every state government determined blanket mandates longer necessary. Get vaccinated, enjoy life. Exactly! worked essential business pandemic.  sad got stress enforcing masks pandemic itself. We've much hope people stop jerks. Why? vaccine works. Totally right.

At point everyone needs decide risk tolerance need doubt they'll take extra precautions, whole point situation yet fully vaccinated CDC told everyone could stop wearing masks. 

the status quo fine. everyone wearing masks, even us fully vaccinated, others back line catching vaccinations. one suffering wearing mask minor even call inconvenience. 

then CDC jumped gun gave everyone all-clear ditch masks, including people refuse get vaccinated since indistinguishable vaccinated people wearing masks. Even people vaccinated wear masks, still pass others far know, though signs indicating transmission risk possibly lower non-vaccinated people. heard dead peasant insurance? I‚Äôm worried drive minuscule possibility contracting COVID store severe case actually affects I've vaccinated since December/January (paramedic/nurse got first dibs). elated hear CDC recommending dropping masks vaccinated people (because science there). morning went Kroger still wore mask. one thing, sign door still says store policy wear them. another, seems.....respectful? workers, anyone else chance fully vaccinated yet. know. There's going transition period. can't flip switch. choose get vaccinated, that‚Äôs deal consequences.

Except longer viruses circulate, greater chance variant developing may eventually overcome current vaccines policy = politics    
We can't force masks forever... try?  anything ambiguous cherry pick ""experts"" articles, right entire year. reality COVID potentially life threatening, make priority life take hour two takes get vaccine. There's walk spots states, can't wait ""convenient"" last 3% Joe Schmo's find perfect time slot. Businesses hit hard COVID certainly luxury. assume expertise greater CDC, no? using vaccine passports really bad idea? fully vaccinated? Like two weeks post second dose? play devil's advocate here.

CDC yesterday said vaccinated people ""very unlikely"" pass infections unvaccinated individuals.

Yet 8 vaccinated individuals somehow got it, likely other..... so.. directly contradict CDC said? understand ONE unlikely infection happening... 8?

And say got J&amp;J vaccine lower efficacy, well publicized J&amp;J can't compared Pfizer/Moderna numbers clinical trials conducted differently. resident Michigan, going lift people vaccinated 1st July Could agree more! Maybe, think part people wanted we're seeing outcome that. isn‚Äôt. conversation regarding Covid never stopping people getting sick ever again, preventing death.

Go back old Reddit posts here, used general consensus Covid restrictions would longer needed vulnerable elderly people got vaccine... assumption people 65 would able vaccinated point.

Everything life carries risk different. recognize risk op points reality we‚Äôre looong past point vulnerable people vaccinated/have many opportunities be.

From personal risk assessment. aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet try things like delivering groceries avoid crowds can‚Äôt wear n95.

It‚Äôs CDC aggressive stuff they‚Äôre giving recommendations vaccinated people ditch masks must feel confident world won‚Äôt fall apart result private companies well within rights follow CDC‚Äôs updated guidelines. Except sinovac. Yeah I‚Äôm beginning think sucker following rules days. case now? 

I remember people Reddit months ago claiming become mutation factory could undo that‚Äôs sorted far

Is case anymore? 

Ngl getting lost point info flying around Although still doubts whether good idea, that‚Äôs definitely fair point. Thanks information read article? people 80 specifically. Well top CEO's nothing, get saying. get paid worth. Suits right ground! think sane rational society sacrificed enough anti vaxxers. still right thing anytime want country.

They better damn well get moving on! tell vaccinated people teeth.

Probably wearing camo either. essential workers chance vaccinated now. Really see big deal. Wtf read? disney? even line usually closer 6 feet someone times? Lol matter? people fully vaccinated US next couple weeks. COVID cases going continue crash future outbreaks slim none completely manageable hospitals. Well I'm never shopping Kroger again. matters since there's none nearby anyways.  Everyone accused CDC political trump rejoiced would go back objective Biden. CDC makes decision based months empirical evidence since people agree accuse CDC political again. Okie dokie need mask outside even unvaccinated  year data, I'm willing trust CDC considered factors. blanket change guidance significant means weighed risks determined significant enough warrant continuing mandates. union.. vote strike! Wish information studies.

I searched news reports referred real time studies Israel America, specifics either. still possibility breakthrough, albeit rare.

Since breakthrough infections tend asymptomatic, people even know one. ‚ÄúMost variants, still cause illness‚Äù.  Survival goal, never want sick again. stand wearing mask public people haven‚Äôt vaccinated (able not) protected. continue Covid isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdaily conversation topic‚Äù memory Problem people choice shop, typically boycotting reduces demand labor, thus resulting fewer jobs store.

We need tax rich. make illegal pay CEO 30x base salary company. unionize grocery workers. all, need organize.  Good point. Thank you

I posting article elsewhere saw article posted thought chime get bit discussion going realized previous take away numbers article others entirely correct. Either way, getting second dose important skipped available given developing situation variants concern. people wearing masks. see lot people void risk assessment bragging they‚Äôre going keep wearing masks even though they‚Äôre vaccinated ‚ÄútHeRe‚Äôs StIlL cHaNce!!!!‚Äù see wearing them, they‚Äôll follow suit people don‚Äôt want different variants popping seem affecting kids more, could yet unknown later life consequences getting virus like chicken pox/shingle. Vaccines way effective that. mistaken way efficacy measured things. Also, masks also 100% effective. cloth masks people wear lower 95% effective, yet people comfortable leaving house wearing those. thing 0 risk life target. vaccines work protect vaccinated others threat vaccinated person. I'm concerned anyone doing. think policy unenforceable makes little sense.

And actually unhappy. even live US moment. don‚Äôt really get this, workers ones generating profits come don‚Äôt get decide goes?  Truth. distancing masks help protect them.

I'm sorry parents anyone else literally banned wearing masks?

Mask mandates still effect schools, public transit, airports, hospitals places. Furthermore, one stopping children wearing masks. people sleep night? used work Kroger bagger. Glad quit shit show. fair, believe parents aware that, set facts presented every time someone brings protecting children. issue death. longer term effects (see things like polio others major issues later life)? problem know, means caution best approach. can't imagine kids major health problems later chose take easy precautions behalf. get vaccinated. 

Unless they're allergic. certain age. Or.

I'm *still gonna mask*. feel free whatever type judge want. makes feel better, less 300 children died covid US entire pandemic, specific concern really nothing stress over, statistically One extra week cuz right
# science Got it! feel like people getting vaccinated Majority Michigan, say social media indication. may never reach herd immunity though. Probably hockey. Stanley Cup Playoffs starting soon. NHL gave Canadian government June 1 deadline allow US Canadian Teams move freely across border moving Canadian teams US cities use home base divisional playoffs. alot hippie antivaxxers go CDC isn‚Äôt changing mask rules.

Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini mama Mia Actually really doesn‚Äôt matter people contract thing less people get hospitalized die it. spreads asymptomatic really doesn‚Äôt matter  can't say trust CDC's judgment much, although trust science. CDC's messaging terrible throughtout whole affair; really need hire new PR team. Good freaking God! Yet companies wonder one work them? Boy Walmart drops mask requirements..its...OVER people! üòÉüòéü§ó‚úåüëçüëèüéâ‚ú®üéà

Over vaccinated anyway, that's care TBH. anti science people fend themselves. saw someone literally say there‚Äôs still finite risk spreading it, it‚Äôs like playing russian roulette children despite fact flu dangerous children. probably don‚Äôt think twice driving around children though seriously injures hundreds thousands people every year US Read Nytimes today 88% epidemiologists thought we‚Äôd wearing 6 months more.

Wonder massive discrepancy. 6 months pretty insane considering low numbers effective vaccines are.

Sort makes wonder they‚Äôre completely wrong Here's interesting question:

1. Moderna/Pfizer incredibly effective preventing serious illness;
2. Moderna/Pfizer appear effective effective preventing infection transmission.
3. We've transitioned supply equal greater demand. 

Depending timing Pfizer approval, locked 3 vaccine portfolio next year-ish? 

The FD&amp;C Act requires showing adequate, APPROVED available alternatives. Pfizer applied approval, best opinion 75-90 days out. That's less usual six months 1. they're taking rolling basis, 2. pandemic, 3. because, somewhere there, think FDA might want time fall school semester, can. Novavax possibly AZ applications later - seems like be, least Novavax - they'll need apply full approval, EUA. And, query whether approval request would reviewed expedited basis,or expedited review granted, would full six months?

Again, even we're three foreseeable future, good problem have. first two vaccines home runs, J&amp;J least solid double. Moderna Pfizer 80% effective first dose everyone wanted protected already protected enough  Since checking vaccination records door...what's fucking point saying this? No. 

1) Many symptoms mentioned caused multitude factors. need study more.

2) Children severe reaction COVID unfathomably rare, symptomatic cases nearly that.

3) health organization government level seems thing issue. guy‚Äôs lab done lot research issue answer: full interview linked description links published research. funny people miss this. Trump's CDC, might point (although Redfield quote masks vs. vaccines), Walensky operating abundance caution, would need head sand think thought new guidance came out.   Thank much.  
I booked slot soon eligible.  


Hyper excited it.  oh yes. stand corrected.

still... 600 900K deaths ""some people""? seriously? boosters 50 micrograms instead 100, might bad 4 friends got covid tested negative got fence got first jab local publix. Scared enough get vaccinated. part sorry late party. Good try I‚Äôm arguing effectiveness. problem implementation. can‚Äôt lift mask mandates expect good result. know vaccine dangers we've seen unlikely part temporary COVID dangers. However, know there's long-term stuff vaccines yet. (Like one polio vaccine caused narcolepsy road recall‚ÄîI know early days vaccines existing like comparing modern aircraft toe Wright brothers' first attempt, still.

However, family member live who's healthcare got COVID, likely point. Knock wood I'm fine far. Depending source either 6 7 asymptomatic infections, zero severe cases. Takeaway vaccines work. flu vaccinations year. year predict try get better vaccine variants flu. different likely cooked mushrooms stovetop black powder. I'm pretty sure counts too. Don‚Äôt forget New Hampshire, already dropped mask mandates saying that. think I‚Äôm sixth person block Twitter saying it. 

My favorite still one blocked another person agreeing although hadn‚Äôt conclusively proven yet time, would pretty surprised vaccination *didn‚Äôt* prevent transmission. bet whole social media bubble mad CDC right now. many people think generally comfortable directly dishonest social situations?

I make opposite assumptions making. Within month so, anyone w/o mitigating circumstances decided take vaccine anti-vaxx least vax-hesitant, showing care lot wack-job opinions actually keeping safe, part help end thing, simply listening scientists.

I 100% belief vast majority people fall category exceptionally likely lie vaccine status since they've already proven care lot personal bullshit greater good. lie anything long benefits themselves. Well it‚Äôs kinda hard tell since won‚Äôt tell us stop wearing them. ‚Äúhurting one themselves‚Äù would pandemic  story unfortunately giving people work excuse get vaccinated. ""Why bother get sick anyway?""

Never mind extremely rare asymptomatic symptomatic one minor cold-like symptoms. still Canada near best G20 nations regards first dose. generaly spreader misinformation junk science.

but yes let's give credit credit due. Apparently Dr Oz talked covid shot publicly encouraged public get vaxxed. not. cdc recommend lifting mask mandates. guys can‚Äôt read Fingers crossed. I‚Äôve fully vaccinated while, I‚Äôm ready able live like it.  within 6 feet infected person (laboratory-confirmed clinically compatible illness) cumulative total 15 minutes 24-hour period (for example, three individual 5-minute exposures total 15 minutes one day).

Maybe I'm misunderstanding CDC guidelines, walking around Manhattan, constantly standing close proximity people waiting lights change. Also, often passing people street, moving together large crowds there's many people. definitely see adding 15 minutes exposure walks. maybe stuff like qualify hypocritical. love politicians think write public health policy. telling people listen experts year? reason change guidance CDC trust them. vaccines work, unvaccinated people pose threat me. choose wear mask vaccinated, hurting one themselves.

Edit: misspelling. honestly major retailers start allowing it, feel won‚Äôt choice end mandate. even california said ending mask mandate june. end day, they're screaming void. We're moving forward, vaccinate get best virus, holier thou rants fall fewer fewer ears. Nobody give internet brownie points 2022 posting mask selfies regards virus that's irrelevant vast majority people year. let investigation assume within 2 weeks, since that's long took Universal decide drop temperature checks. many people think generally comfortable directly dishonest social situations? 

Have gone all? It‚Äôs matter actively choosing exposure young child risk. unlucky kid 10% get seriously ill even % die, forever hate exposing kid risk. know it‚Äôs dramatic choice involved, amount risk high opinion.  Imagine fringe people listening CDC thing hardcore last guy supporters Yeah see hear (on least) people trying find fact figure want begin opening process.

Winston Churchill, 11 November 1947 know still think way CDC. Welcome back regular life. Thank you! I've corrected statement. grandparents lived 80+ years without ever experiencing pandemic magnitude. I'm hoping I'm long dead next one. Ok mentions customers, nothing workers. laws already exist states, simply overridden public health orders. public health order gone, restriction face coverings immediately resume. still spread inside country enforces vaccine passports, world catching pandemic starts.

We dying foreigners. one person get we're killing other. None mean anything New York unless Cuomo drops state wide mandate. might keep trying take attention away allegations. Pretty sure u/bloodysphincter meant neither intermediary host even host animal natural reservoir COVID19, key pieces evidence needed natural emergence hypothesis, discovered yet. 

This strange already least 15 months, yet can't find virus came transferred from. contrast host animal SARS discovered within months. need invest giant slide, make sure get jet pack go Costco Trader Joe's two saw.  I've muted every phrase related pandemic. Yeah that's also good point. exchange rate kinda dictates guys need process bigger numbers easily. UK something costs ¬£1000 already expensive 10/100,000 unreal money.

Childfree* child yet offered vaccine?   mention trusting people wear wear mask entirely honor system country large, large portion people vocally ACTUALLY ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù advocate mass die-offs ‚Äúthe disease running course‚Äù definition ‚Äúreckless‚Äù. 

If you‚Äôre American think trusting Americans abide honor system regarding vaccines reckless, got news friend Walmart doesnt pay anywhere near minimum wage. seems every surge similar timeline. sure lockdowns, increased awareness/preventative measures, vaccines (in case) sort localized burnout. Hopefully side worst vaccines increase. glad kicking virus's ass US life getting back normal pretty quickly, I'm worried next pandemic. know matter if. 

Are worried next pandemic much am? rural areas, yes, true. live masks strictly enforced. guess thing cold flu season? covid? interesting retelling scientists fought demonstrate threat. wonder global response would different CDC emphasized aerosol spread beginning. two customer bases obviously. Greece, several months. lifted couple weeks ago. [Link actual 9,245 mild cases. 9245 total cases, 9% hospitalized (the definition severe), 1% died. 

The risk breakthrough infection low, zero risk. Lots testing. make sure safe. us valid points. don‚Äôt agree.

I worried maskless unvaccinated adults spreading Covid children can‚Äôt yet get vaccinated. worried impossible enforce mask mandate vaccinated unless simply make everyone wear masks. (None contradicts cdc.)

The way IMO either get point vaccinated low transmissions. 40k day there. I've heard WalMart dropped mask mandate, stores followed? done education reform past 7 years, far standards kids learning.

However, many places, kids accountability. continually get promoted next grade despite demonstrating completed standards put 0 effort class. High School actually *need* pass classes, even often much get ""D"" like ""no scores less 50%."" Probably first vaccination something they've actually seen noticeable effect lives. reality check hits squarely face, get vaccinated. vaccination campaign lost pace lost pace india stopped exports, china russia stepped deliveries started again.

i think we're 6 million first shot near 5 million fully vaccinated (from targeted 32 millions)

its great good enough imo.

healthcare workers, law enforcement teacher 40 vaccinated.

plus people 55 think.

cases deaths low trending (around 300 cases 3 deaths day )

but spent ramadan post iftar curfew, i've fairly sure cases rise open again.  literally talking since last year hey anyone thinks called 'antivaxxer' 'conspiracy theorist' really cutting hours. like eliminating positions.  tell who, fully vaccinated, saying I, also fully vaccinated, wear mask times establishments, he'll walk away refuse accompany me. one baffling things come news yesterday

I get hard give mask trauma last year, trust CDC year telling people trust CDC, fuck? 70% happening, matter anymore. CDC told states lift mask mandates many states beginning comply. pandemic over. Preach Usually NE states move bloc CT dropping restrictions 19th. Indoor masks vaccinated folks gone well. thing north side Chicago could right. ADA It‚Äôs shitty really. Hopefully chances kids catching low area.  wish would vaccinate population first Congrats! I'm taking kids August...the first ""fun"" outing long time. idea vaccine passport problems. minute make document high-stakes thing, create industry counterfeiting document. already happening existing vaccine cards.

(Documents like driver's licenses passports designed extremely difficult counterfeit reason. Even so, consider record.) 

If big fraction vaccine passports counterfeit, whole thing becomes useless perhaps worse useless. Setting standardized counterfeit resistant vaccine certificate system take years. Republican Americans 18% likely take vaccine means relaxed mask social distancing guidelines.

So we're losing incentive there's mask mandate anymore. They're going bother. obvious threshold like ""60-70% total vaccinated"" dropping mandate it'd make sense, follow CDC's logic here. Republicans bother move lives now.  Studies shown people likely get vaccinated comes relaxed covid measures actually. depending government responds this, could way people lie get vaxxed. Well said. fun hate corporations Reddit particular one saving lives world deserve stronger business end good done. means even better chance next time need drugs produced quickly. concerns. thought, live Covid probably worse spike protein. science saying safe go maskless vaccinated, currently way identify. way identify vax people, we'd start relaxing Kids 11 still exist per current recommendations, need wear mask. public transit settings, masks still everywhere. Well quarter third Americans want jump cliff facebook meme reasons pay price it

This ol' argument gets used political cheerleaders either side. COVID, guns, etc. Everyone plays sides argument fits narrative. think assume anywhere close 30% point. exactly unavailable already? Dine restaurants open, people care parties home since last year. Almost businesses open capacity, including children's play areas. 

Taking mask restrictions fine, see changes anything people act inconvenienced wearing additional piece clothing, also problem wearing baseball caps everywhere. duck cover 2.0 We‚Äôre 55%+ fully vaccinated adults nyc, yes case adults. Neanderthal thinking 2 months ago‚Ä¶according one correct consistent parent comment expands space priors. 

People shouldn‚Äôt downvoting comment much. nuance frustrating, especially times. would like healthy adults get vaccine infection rate drop low enough live normally. half country believing lies decided mutate virus further. republicans wanted fuckin haircuts.  deliberately obtuse? so, well done...

If not...wow, wow... obviously nextdoor! People around happy Biden/ governor lifting mask requirement.  fully vax parents unvaccinated kids, take much precaution kids. dont trust honor system. believe unmask people one vaccinated.

Yes yes kids survival rate bla bla bla.... Im everything protect next months eligible get vaccine get decent percentage vaccinated people ( 70% ish ) Maybe Fox News et al quit pumping vaccine scare tactics people stop believing Tucker Carlson wouldn‚Äôt half situation we‚Äôre in.

It‚Äôs data quality sociologists UCLA Harvard. top 0.1% human behavior experts world. 

If personal preference disagree, that‚Äôs fine. always value high education data regardless emotional feelings results.  reason ridicule people still cautious, complicated that. idea incentivize vaccinations. think will, I'm wary tossing mandate entirely quickly. problem NYC large amount mass transit. Cuomo likely trying come way two different sets rules: one NYC would stricter one rest state would lax. Dang, hoping better cell phone reception. There's evidence CDC considered though. Meh, he‚Äôll relent within week two. People NYC done Covid restrictions. all, Cuomo cares popularity. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre give medical advice. I‚Äôll call doctors tell news! hope continues! worry many antivax idiots there, covid rise herd immunity achieved. Funny would mention actually related risk getting covid... Asymptomatic unlikely spread according first link, info pre symptomatic spread vaccinated individuals? Holy shit entitlement....

**California reports 3,100 ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô COVID cases among April 26, Centers Disease Control Prevention recorded 9,245 breakthrough cases among 95 million vaccinated United States, including 132 deaths. That‚Äôs infection rate .01 percent. 
According federal agency, 45 percent post-vaccination cases people age 60 older. 15 percent deaths, person tested positive coronavirus death related COVID-19. 
Nationally, breakthrough cases included 835 hospitalizations, 70 percent patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. 
According CDC website, efforts study breakthrough cases based voluntary reporting state health departments cases counted. CDC updated number breakthrough cases nearly 10 days. 
California‚Äôs health department said data breakthrough cases consistent findings coronavirus vaccines effective preventing severe starters, half covid infections asymptomatic, end hospitalization (and 1-2% end death).

&amp;#x200B;

are impression 

vaccinated &amp; infected &amp; asymptomatic still transmit?

that they're risk unmasked?

&amp;#x200B;

where see that?

may ""unknown"" trials, ***real world***.. likely. start May, CDC shifted

Here, another chromosome ask got data? I‚Äôd like share family still hesitant exactly whats happening large swaths country unofficially like last 8 months officially last month two? Looking numbers Kroger, average store brings $950k per year net profits per store. run out, likely store makes $100k - $1.x million net profits per year. LA Times ""under performing"", likely low end range. 

The area question added $4 hour hazard pay, amounts bit $8.3k per year per employee, plus additional FICA California mandated fees (over $9k per employee per year). Average per store 72, approx 1/2 2/3rds full time equivalents, based searches industry averages (Dept. Labor, etc.), $369,000 $648,000 additional costs per year. performing, likely could afford it, least store per store basis. 

These stories titillate look dollars versus billions headline. But, honest, retirement plan 2800 different investments 3 costing money, would dump them. would car routinely repaired. case, look macrocosm, changing economics (either companies negative stocks mechanics make money auto repairs). Yes, know analogies fail.

I like Kroger stores. one convenient, normally drive farther Publix Sprouts avoid them. Much horrible employees compared others. But, even disdain Kroger, ""this proves Kroger sucks"" camp. forgotten, lift much once. People come around. early days.  data says opposite. likelihood increased. 

I somewhat agree. people never vaccinated matter what. 

We can‚Äôt live guidelines forever people. vaccine available. likelihood take vaccine increases guidelines relaxed. Dang ol deepstate putting anti covid 5G shot. Test positivity rate 1/3 rd peak. Really depends, kids would show symptoms even fewer develop life threatening conditions covid19. people really need worry covid19 ill elderly. Him: ""they say wear mask""

Him: ""but think I'm going to""

Me: ""ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"" argument involves assumptions arguments continuing wear masks. 

Masks worn without health complications protect take vaccine. Mask wearing complex paint be. also don‚Äôt know prior infection evenly distributed getting vaccinated don‚Äôt really know many previously infected non vaccinated groups gooby pls Watch company changes policies regarding positive covid infection. unexcused absence, use PTO. course don‚Äôt. pressure premature relaxing restrictions Sounds like brother shouldn‚Äôt reproducing begin he‚Äôs type fall myths. three week quarantine would humane. Whole world done so. Sorry folks! Making excuse FORCE people unemployment back slave wage jobs important children!

Capitalism always wins health others good old U.S.! :) government history mistreating group people based skin color turns wont really trust government even good. I've seen several experts speculate openly this, seen studies confirm this. actual studies I've seen shown reinfection rate via natural immunity much lower vaccine breakthrough rate. CDC literally said need wear one vaccinated. follow directions door stores fine This! There‚Äôs two options. 

Either greatest scientists world knew people would lie didn‚Äôt.

I believe knew people would lie. 

No source. assumptions. Gov. Murphy man last year said earnestness last year family members socially distance HOME. He's loon.  People live either wouldn‚Äôt wear masks would wear chins, back vaccine cases deaths exponentially increasing. haven‚Äôt got vaccine yet, absolutely way removing unenforced ignored mask rules encourage that. taught amount value placed certain lives versus peoples' minor comfort convenience. guess better know. I'm wondering ""CDC requires cook eggs wear sunscreen"" people right now. wish understood them. They're asking stop life, reply pointless. Plus well 100 million infections USA. alarming stupid people must reference 35 million. Here's baffles me. Social distancing, getting hang friends understand celebrations coming back. God damn, even people wore masks amount joy getting rid is... childish. 

I'm going get downvoted hell, fucking big pain, pain separating people. 

""HOLY SHIT WORLD INFINITELY BETTER WITHOUT CLOTH WITH"" Seriously...wtf mask, 85 lbs backpack. understand trusting government, I‚Äôd do, look nations world high vaccine rates that‚Äôs plummeted covid cases. motive country like Israel play along US politics American big-pharma‚Äôs plan world domination?

Frustrating little people America using critical thinking. Source? Pfizer paid various governments. government paid you.  exact reason going continue wearing mask require five year old wear one well. daughter starts kindergarten August. school board longer requiring students wear masks I'm terrified. Fuck statistics, child dies burn town ground.

My hope vaccine children then. likely, they're Republicans showing loyalty Trump Anti-vaxxers already anti l-maskers probably moving around without mask anyway. What‚Äôs really gonna change? September long way off, already gave one summer pandemic. It‚Äôs rare healthy kids die Covid, I‚Äôm scientists one. people get vaccinated. Idk downvoted, right.

Stop American companies sheltering overseas closing loopholes making attractive locally.

I always see complaints never actions dumbass infertility myth brother vaccinate family, due going come wedding. Fuck social media. Considering young enough use Reddit, 99% chance getting hospitalized anyways...  They‚Äôre also banning wearing mask still catch spread covid vaccine. puts lid developing extreme symptoms. It‚Äôs based observation. Trump politicized pandemic. expect make COVID memory others refuse take steps towards normalcy? Didnt say components lockdown could contribute poor health? Unless course kids aren‚Äôt yet eligible. wish we‚Äôd waited till everyone able get it. yes, know kids less risk, would nice vulnerable ones chance get vaccine let anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers go buck wild everywhere. know people hate hear this, ""scientific"" way reopening ought trials states un-mask (control), see difference is, any, case numbers, hospitalizations, etc. whether differences, any, within acceptable bounds. jump in. course, CDC can't say one state participating experiment others, states might setting big experiment now. bit behind. none exist live. seem rather touch considering vast nation is.

Your experience necessarily reflect everyone's. think naive.

Much rural America options without driving 30-50 miles.

You realize small towns lot big name stuff right? soon enough. hope wrong need cookie? incentive knowing wouldn‚Äôt get hospitalized caught it?

And that‚Äôs entirely true. places offered incentives sad may be. celebrate damn effective vaccines are? Rather making mask vs mask, time rally around importance vaccination.

It‚Äôs exciting see disease get stuffed real time. rarely wore masks first place, yet still several palpable decreases case numbers. going change much, aside vaccinated Americans enjoying largely-maskless life yet again. true, especially direct competition practically across street, case.

Unfortunately, direct competition happens Publix Walmart, I'm already boycotting shitty practices. It‚Äôs healthy stay ‚Äúcompletely inside 4 months‚Äù. Staying safe COVID doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing health ways See New York Yankees. 8 individuals (3 coaches, 4 staff, 1 player) caught transmitted COVID, fully vaccinated J&amp;J. Maybe Pfizer Moderna reduce transmission, J&amp;J doesn‚Äôt. luckily one sick, still quarantine it‚Äôs clearly transmissible.  Except black people almost universally Democrats, meaning relevant comparison white Dems vs black Dems, something like 90% 60%, statistically equivalent Dem vs. GOP gap.

Right, except wearing mask protect infectious nearly effective infectious individuals wearing masks. ones risk (ie cannot vaccinate) cannot adequately protect likely contract spread infection likely continue wearing masks. 

I'm super excited mRNA technology finally able take this, I'll tell people going required boosters frequently vaccination rates likely drop successive boosters. happens flu shot already, everyone gets every year. 

The best way tackle shifts pandemic periodic endemic masking acceptable enforced. sends wrong message particular point time say ""go take masks"" vaccination rates low. 277 children died even though lockdown measures taken masks use. happens masks used anymore social distancing enforced? kids gonna get sick. lot may fine deaths. Families children always tough life. I‚Äôm sorry them. risk child dying covid lower It‚Äôs age instant news. know NOW!  doctors offices, airplanes, probably crowded indoor spaces. Especially *I* sick. scientists Centers Disease Control disagree you. I‚Äôm going listen you. this. 

the CDC providing incentive, along 12-15yo's getting cleared, FDA authorization quite close, also ~26 million recovered variable immunity ranges robust durable. 

they probably calculate boost incentive national herd immunity end summer would reached. 

edit - forget fall perhaps june-ish, we'll hearing schools (over 6th grade thru post-secondary ed.) likely require vaccination. Also even check vaccinated status, unless go route vaccine passports, people want even less. asinine, disingenuous people likely mostly unvaccinated.

And CDC correctly placing likelihood high possible. Humanity loses reading stupidity Well we‚Äôre going get data 60 years may well stay masked, inside, socially distanced 59 years, right? future refrence: please spell opinion covid vaccine, efforts mitigate 2020-21, letting runs course woudl've acceptable. Hear, hear! CDC obviously considered fact unvaccinated people might lie vaccinated remove masks PLUS fact children haven‚Äôt received one shot yet PLUS fact adults aren‚Äôt two weeks second shot yet, still decided risk acceptable given far we‚Äôve come vaccines. don‚Äôt know random concerned redditors acting like first realize it? dudes smarter CDC. Chill. Children, especially ones immune issues health issues, absolutely died covid. new guidelines mean everyone else returns normal, don‚Äôt. 
 
I mean sound unsympathetic, point view society large, seems reasonable.  pandemic wanes (in places) high-risk going left behind bit longer, speak.  Unfortunate, unexpected unreasonable Well, it‚Äôs CDC guidance, clearly don‚Äôt check typing. shops crowds. one going risk kids. kids level risk (immunocompromised, young infants, preexisting conditions). 

Moreover, one asking ‚Äúnot live.‚Äù They‚Äôre asking people continue wearing masks‚Äîa mild inconvenience most. Don‚Äôt drama Queen. Except deiniftive evidence elderly dying much quicker rates honestly last sentence bright since mortality rate children still extremely low. fully vaccinated people hospital died cancer. one vaccinated person caught overseas, well, that's expected. Also main reason many vaccinated folks want mask permanently. signal affiliation.

That's silly claim OP. want people mask permanently masks help prevent covid flu airborne illness. Further, worry prioritizing high tech solutions vaccines low tech solutions like masks grow dependent advanced technology hero every time unprepared ever fails. However, recognize American's like behavioral based solutions; see impingement freedom. I'm saying increase, even though total % vaccinations similar, states may people vaccinations longer (and immunity) vaccinations spread broader set age distribution, outbreaks smaller. don‚Äôt know long-term impacts getting covid. Parkinson‚Äôs rates skyrocketed years later Spanish flu, example. chicken pox, shingles happen line. don‚Äôt know yet issue. first comment op immediately pointed racial group contributing somethings up. ‚Äòbout 50% first dose far closer Republicans white Democrats. Well moot point now. next time I'm walmart wearing mask first time year per CDC instructions!

Science! Gotta love it! provide evidence vaccinated people spread virus? concern always read yet know whether vaccinated people could spread virus, operating assumption safety. Recent evidence confirms suspected along, vaccinated people typically transmit No. It‚Äôs both. It‚Äôs free all. It‚Äôs incentivizing getting vaccine. idea lead net positive public health.  Balls. never going hit 80% vaccination rate, that‚Äôs reality. 

It‚Äôs guarantee, it‚Äôs increased likelihood. 

When comes human behavior, best idea place likelihood vaccination high possible. 

And data says likelihood highest vaccination results relaxed guidelines.  Something like 67% No, learned something. propagating year we've learned fact dangerous children general. true flu everyone first, mean similar statement true children. Worry concern make valid. I'm curious NY give us guidance here. waiting game. mean, feel locked mask wearing whole time 2 children, comment CDC appeasing anti-maskers complete bullshit.

The science science data data.

117m vaccinated people 9,200 cases covid zero hospitalizations.

And zoom look whole pandemic, 72m age 18 US. 499 group died Covid. 

I really sympathize you, right call. kids die flu. need vaccine passport. People want go around without fear virus, non-vaccinated people interfere freedom suck, describing people high risk take precautions. true new guidance true after. guidance effect situation. begrudge people risk factors?

Here's reality. wore mask, fully vaccinated. mask on, protecting you. vaccine, protecting you. longer need mask protect vaccine pulling weight. 

On flip side, jackass wear mask ever protecting still isn't.

On sides coin, basically situation. unhappy people, mask become entirely redundant, take off?

I young kids too. staying masked indoors crowds. nothing vaccinated people do.  Nah masked super careful whole time. got vaccine 2 months ago, started going often feeling safe. cdc released statement longer feel need wear mask, still follow science. nationwide eviction moratorium pretty big leap public health agency. think CDC acted greatest capacity, fail messaging guidance. national leadership controls purse agree coherent message whether goal actually keep people home, tools keep people home.

""Airborne"" still factor tight indoor settings, CDC make exceptions (prisons, transit, homeless shelters, healthcare facilities) latest update. crazy unfortunately based 2020-2021 numbers flu, masks (&amp; social distancing certainly role) better preventing flu flu shots ever been. 

flu shots bit guessing game due process guessing flu strain prevelent given year well season really picks up, producing vaccines many months year early. covid masks / social distancing there've basically flu infections since early 2020. 

but ship sailed masks going thing past flu back us. 

even wear mask, others matter much masks function better block people spreading, uptaking particles release wearing masks. 

tldr / edit - i'm saying is, best method handling flu we've ever ending speak. hey, bright side, maybe new possible ways make flu vaccines faster produce efficacious?  accurate Amid review CDC guidelines, decided I‚Äôm done masks :) It‚Äôs problem vaccinated drop mask. It‚Äôs problem change play reality. It‚Äôs honor system. non-vaccinated anti-maskers won‚Äôt wear mask either. masks primarily worn protect others, problematic children don‚Äôt yet access vaccine. I‚Äôm also personally concerned parents yet vaccinated. mom recently became anti-vaccine, she‚Äôs blame risk she‚Äôs taking. dad hasn‚Äôt gotten yet doesn‚Äôt want deal wrath. blame getting taking risk also ultimately him, I‚Äôve hoping change mind. Now, risks higher he‚Äôs got multiple co-morbidities. Make mistake, it‚Äôs think people keep wearing masks protect people like could get vaccine wanted. But, children different story. difference masking person choice, social conformity. people really care one way other, they're gonna everyone else does. quarter country stops masking they're vaccinated another quarter decides lie vaccinated stop masking, another quarter third stop people wear them. find out? reoccurring theme vaccines actually go doctor get test done? cousin autoimmune diseases wondering good.. Can't. per OB regular doctor.  hospital's ER least four people covid it, one forties low sats, another sit waiting. far came norovirus, true, floor someone fully vaccinated caught overseas, who's badly off. Get vaccines, preferably Pfizer, what's best you. hospital still requires masks.  I'm saying disregard survey data. I'm saying surveys mean anything situation said they'd vaccinate end vaccinating. knowledge, point time, increases vaccination account knowledge mask recommendations gone. case states mask mandates already canned, significant rise vaccination rates despite vaccinations open everyone 12+.

I say I'm saving retirement means nothing unless actually it. say I'm going vote means nothing cast ballot. covid hospitalization: expensive (for everyone) Oh, yeah. way that's happening, thank goodness.

Honestly, lifting happening sooner initially thought beginning pandemic. relatives ""This control people they're going enforce vaccinations depopulate world able go anywhere unless vaccinated"" said, ""it's gonna like Spanish flu things bad masking stuff year two new Roaring 20's"".

Yeah, seems like right, sooner thought. Yes true yeah fair point, looking part would good know truth matter is. Though imagine would many years ever know. Got source that? That's good hear. Motivation would money. government doesn‚Äôt want actually get people vaccinated seems.   Nah, plenty Masked Minnesotans still. It‚Äôs responsible still wear mask, like wearing pants. expect CDC lied masks first place, tripping get rid it. anti makers anti vaxers? Really? Many states stopped ordering vaccines massive quantities demand slowed much. people refuse lifesaving meds made choice.

They cannot allowed hamstring whole country done right thing! seems like dumb go. Continue take precautions want see vaccinated creating problem. others vaccinated that's problem, yours. reasonably healthy adults vaccinated covid probably make top 5 riskiest things day day life  I‚Äôm essential worker, I‚Äôve trying convince office vaccinate months. reason one wants to. commute 2 hours work shocked different attitude towards Covid different demographics answer probably want order safe. likely get COVID give kid. also likely get car wreck, still put seatbelt, right? 

Wearing mask best way get virus, essentially downside mildly inconvenient. mildly inconvenient stuff TIME name safety.

Big thing remember 15% kids infected get long COVID (symptoms 5 weeks infection) get better months. Kids far away likely get COVID friend family member rather kids (for whatever reason). 5% chance getting infected vaccine, means 1% chance getting giving kid. That's really small! happen people, chance happening WAY smaller mask keep environments adults masked. long take recover that? mean local state level restrictions still apply. There‚Äôs reason CDC hold back entire country couple localized spikes. Yes they're going fight bunch Karens going around trying start trouble make youtube video oppressed minimum wage worker Wal Mart. think places ignoring people wear masks. ""America first"" 55% Michiganders 16 older least one dose vaccine. definitely majority. Yep agree outlier invalidate general theory. guess concern vaccinated people get tested asymptomatic, really much data this. Yankees knew situation test regularly reason mere formality. one upset wearing mask, upset try act like makes better person science shows doesn't. choose continue wear mask want, one stop you. f u ck Krogers recent studies confirm people infected vaccination carry little virus infect others, said Florian Krammer, virologist Icahn School Medicine Mount really hard even sequence virus sometimes there‚Äôs little virus, it‚Äôs short period time,‚Äù said.

-	New York Times I‚Äôm guessing still won‚Äôt enough you. believe want won‚Äôt accept evidence contrary. Evidence led CDC make guidelines. 

Hey, think I‚Äôm smart too‚Ä¶I keep articles watch trends. ain‚Äôt doctor I‚Äôm certainly qualified making public health decisions. 

So trust making decisions scientific evidence mind. Hell I‚Äôve disagreed outdoor masking ages now‚Ä¶but realized really stubborn things according science ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù. 

Of course could end wrong, I‚Äôd follow guidance anyone else‚Äôs. think person replied pointing unvaccinated people still cause concern everyone, potentially. new variant, vaccine effective against, mutates Covid breeding ground like India? That's push still shutting fast possible  Fail know everyone wants vaccinated fully vaccinated, right? two friends first second dose worry anti-vaxxers walking around grocery store without mask on. Basically shit like happens healthcare system near collapse workers forced massively overworked. could gotten same, unvavccinated source. J&amp;J vaccine effective preventing transmission extremely effective preventing severe symptoms, 70% effective preventing asymptomatic infection general. 

Therefore would conclude likely exposed infected, unvaccinated individual rather spreading other. sense, truly puts onus vaccination unvaccinated less obvious yet far targeted way.  Honestly could get sibling vaccinate deserve PhD overcoming mental gymnastics uses justify getting America, fuck yeah. gonna go? Walmart? Amazon-owned Whole Foods? Meijer, fire six seconds late clock in? Yes zero, aim push 60% population think people get there. Much numerous group soft demanders scared COVID would get getting vaxxed would hinder way. That‚Äôs true. def think easing restrictions cause landslide lifted. that‚Äôs true wait little longer. 

However people keep told hang little bit longer think soon things begin go back normal one way another. think CDC realizes this. really hope enough. know 90% coworkers antivax, Covid case week. hoping would begin feel pressure vaccinate, go wherever without proof, suspect might see mutated cases areas NPR put article today. [What New Mask Guidance Means Unvaccinated Kids ‚Äî  didn‚Äôt wear one first either, based suggestions. But, working sciences, also understand understanding novel situations fluid ever evolving.

In experience stopped enforcing masking months ago officially rolling back policy recommending masks non-vaccinated people formality General discussion I've seen counter argument someone vaccinated, getting COVID really extreme worry anymore. Generally, get minor symptoms, that's it.

You got remember there's enough data CDC, Fauchi, Biden administration agree -- means they're pretty confident fine, political backlash would insane.

Bc people pushing idea reducing restrictions isn‚Äôt helping anything. yes tiny tiny population can‚Äôt get vaccine ever. 

Someone else pointed it‚Äôs bc people fought long keep everyone masked, right time, theyre hard time coming grips choosing wear one right thing. Please consider reading post medical journal Lancet explains efficacy calculated. key quote ""Simple mathematics helps. vaccinated population 100 000 protected 95% them, would leave 5000 individuals diseased 3 months, almost current overall COVID-19 case rate UK. Rather, 95% vaccine efficacy means instead 1000 COVID-19 cases population 100 000 without vaccine (from placebo arm abovementioned trials, approximately 1% would ill COVID-19 99% would not) would expect 50 cases (99¬∑95% population disease-free, least 3 months)."".

The argument never get 0 infections cannot point go back normal. level risk gets lower many daily activities choose do, return normal. risk death car accident exists, require crash helmets drive even though would lower risks death injury.

Edit: would also add clinical trials conducted much smaller percentage public vaccinated. nearly 50% population vaccinated US, efficacy improves significantly risk exposure drops exponentially. Hey...for geriatrics kind rough...

The rest us gave 14 months counting sniffles... Collectively power business companies. 2021 we're internet. platform everyone come together pledge shop there. fungus disease around long time, Covid rarely causes it. issue India 1. Likely poor hygiene hospitals patient overflow 2. High humidity allowing fungi breed 3. Indian hospitals overusing steroid Covid treatment making people susceptible disease.

While definitely scary fungus, isn‚Äôt really common Covid patients. anything, people hopefully learn perhaps methods treating Covid harm good. agree you, let's pretend CDC 100% trustworthy. personally wear mask beginning told us help, even increase chances getting covid. 
Fast forward two months everyone state required wear face covering public. Well know anti mask people continuously screaming herd immunity. going step lives line get there.

I mean dumb choice free effective vaccines every street corner America pretty much but.... Likely form guidelines recommending masking county county based level community transmission rather blanket statement ending 90% compulsory masking vaccinated people think number people scared covid haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated pretty small. don‚Äôt think group talking includes many scared.

Anecdotally, don‚Äôt know anybody takes covid seriously hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccinated yet. Nothing 100% guaranteed. Live life. can‚Äôt expect world always 100% safe. someone without vaccine carrying I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm concerned.  get vaccinated. 

I think know person lives get vaccinated, convincing change mind probably difficult obtaining PhD dissertation ‚ÄúDo pay slaves all?‚Äù -CEO Dude, 223 deaths. ""no risk.""

Yes, low. Yes, virtually none, that's responding to.

Gonna ignore noise go science one.  nuance waiting get it? faster everyone gets it, less people die. one big team stragglers longer gets drawn out. vaccine government subsidized commented vaccinated people pass virus children. evidence that? read NYT article quickly didn‚Äôt look original research, understanding asked people several months ago, prior vaccine availability likelihood get vaccinated, randomly assigned people receive different framing. ‚ÄúHow likely get vaccinated?‚Äù Vs ‚Äúhow likely get vaccinated meant could longer wear mask‚Äù. I‚Äôm arguing second question doesn‚Äôt generalize meaningfully current situation, providing evidence CDC move result increased vaccine uptake.

Anyway, commented thought important dispel idea scientific consensus this. idea scientific consensus incredibly powerful, invoking one ways (that know of) change people‚Äôs minds. [And anything, probably strong consensus among social psychologists boneheaded move part CDC. don‚Äôt know, order estimate consensus, you‚Äôd survey social psychologists...] mean yeah people it. I'm usually pretty lazy comes flu shot though, cause fine. forget also CDC said masks unnecessary one time. sister taken vaccine trying get pregnant husband talked bit it, evidently doctor recommended take it. yeah, evidently lot doctors also misinformed too. Taiwan successful zero covid strategy. every country this, they‚Äôd dealing sub thousand cases too. Depends coming from, quite areas still banned travelling United States.

Basically, travelling directly Schengen Area, UK, Republic Ireland, Brazil, South Africa, India, China Iran, cannot enter United States directly. 

If trying travel one areas need enter US, travel third country banned (Such Mexico), stay 14 days, enter United States directly country, negative COVID test.

There exceptions travel ban, certain visa types, generally way bypass third country route.

Here's CDC page bans: lag. Inertia. Give days. know. want well. got shit days ago people saying that. i've adopted diplomatic tone. Real answer: actually form development years. virus called SARS similar Covid early 2000s. started working vaccine SARS time getting close completion. recipe kinda sat storage decade. Enter covid. Scientists see virus similar sars. pull old recipe replace part need new variables make work covid. wouldn‚Äôt want eat cake someone baked 15 minutes. would trust cake already baked needed frosting.

just seemed odd directing low vaccination rates ethnic group entire political party led someone said covid would vanish own... April... 2020. blaming low vaccination rates political identity supported; racial divisions. 83/56 bigger gap 69/61 

Good link! giving rewards vaccinations becoming common now. Sounds like lack affect flu twice bad young children covid, marginal gain giving children flu vaccine still notably higher covid vaccine... Okay. great summer. know will. :) take risk, say. We've seen consequences. get vaccinated, people. Nice see things slowly returning normal.
I mind wearing mask though, I'll probably still put around crowds, assume bunch people go maskless even vaccinated and/or I'll. Wait minute,a guy r/coronavirus actually getting making sense?Based what? Delaying vaccine research USA funding early enough? Hey thanks Germany! 

Trump jack shit. We're still going keep wearing reduce risk toddler. honor system guideline easing fucking lunacy. publicly available national registry vaccinated, businesses check allowing people maskless. wish! 

Seriously, Disney resources really verify vaccination status guests. Ask people upload photo card make reservations, check state records, give guests shiny WDW ""I'm vaccinated"" badge check in. 

Disney fans 100% get vaccinated get collectible it. downvotes might people prefer model weak gets protected community. 

As far concerned people dont want vaccinate allowed indoor concerts, restaurants etc. see people demonizing poor white people hesitant calling morons see part thread everyone reasoning economic hardship makes seem reasonable hesitant particularly black people. agree, think less race education opportunity.  What‚Äôs pigeonholing sub Reddit? I‚Äôm getting vaccine I‚Äôm white, college educated, unpolitically affiliated male. advocate everyone get vaccine, especially suffer lifestyle disease congenital diseases could exacerbate Covid. personally don‚Äôt reason fear virus. wife didn‚Äôt pass kids. fact sex still exhibiting symptoms.  Business never this. mean, wont. enforce masking. wont enforce vaccination. people hail sort triumph personal freedoms, reality, population bowing corporate usual. 

Money taken politics. Remove incentives politicians keep corporations businesses happy. varies based are. area cases close zero. course based area. Im surprised made long without actually seeing huge spike.  mutations variants occur antivaxxers ""Trust science unless conflicts feelings"" Granted, layperson, thus expert, understanding wearing mask COVID-19, was/is lowering potential exhalation contagious individual much protecting wearer. 

That said wear one wear one me.

Thus, free wear mask time, understanding correct benefit mask diminishes others around aren't. 

A better choice would get yearly flu shot. 

Now always chance missing something so, apologies ahead time. Trump got vaccine that‚Äôs makes ironic lack data long term negative effects covid MRNA vaccine, doesn‚Äôt scare you? scary virus.  love outdoor activities thankful able continue hiking swimming relatively safely there‚Äôs also lot stuff miss like going see movie theater, going bowling, going concert, etc. also turned 21 last summer haven‚Äôt able go bar yet. everyone‚Äôs preference enjoy life COVID-safe camp activities limited last year. Vaccination effective reducing spread masks are. choose one, vaccine would one choose. I‚Äôm sure CDC *significantly* information do. mean nuts see level oppressive government getting approval sub since science gone getting rid masks folks really losing it. essentially means longer require masks anyone all. CDC said masks needed vaccinated 

Meanwhile NYC still curfew bars restaurants keep thinking Greek tragedy Orpheus. He‚Äôs almost hell, turn around everything fine. almost free impatience overcomes looks behind see wife dragged back hell. That‚Äôs personal anxiety; we‚Äôll pull masks precautions back little soon somehow extend pandemic months more. Hawaii operating like country frankly, worked.  Let stupid get sick. 

I feel bad want vaccine, can't get medical reasons. Yup, keep arguing people this. difference vaccine uptake black people white people end day betting deeply rooted economic factors fearing vaccine/government. Can‚Äôt say view regards GOP uptake  thing is, I'd fine fully vaccinated people ones going without mask. standpoint librarian, realistic. cannot ask someone show proof vaccination - violation privacy. hope everyone comes maskless fully vaccinated, /know/.

For right now, safest thing everyone able get vaccinated (kids 12 especially) immunocompromised everyone continue wearing masks indoors. said 60%, poll said 65% ***already*** it. So... someone works walmart fully vaccinated, I'm still wearing mask.  'close zero' right while?? consider close zero, I'm confused Communism, definition, government. government, Communism. incorrect there. situation, singular national economic state. Rather, stateless, classless, moneyless society. misunderstanding vast scale.

As Socialism, think understand well either. Socialism ""the rich taxed"" ""government stuff"". Socialism transition Capitalism Communism. workers jointly means production, many forms. 

Some forms Authoritarian nature, like Marx Lenin's conception Dictatorship Proletariat means vanguard party (we currently live Dictatorship Bourgeoisie). Others Libertarian nature, Anarchist Syndicalism, advocate for.

What talking Social Democracy. better still utterly exploitative.
Under form Socialism, few, any, rich people all. wealth there's stole surplus labor value workers. 

What describing Anarchist Communism. way convince people make palatable. already liberating political philosophy currently have. show world wholly unpalatable, show results vision preferable. 

My strategy? Unionize tenants workplaces, using mutual aid mechanisms like community gardens, fridges, wide scale aid, advocacy, syndicate (a union unions) perform General Strike conditions end collapse State Capital, wherein workers simply displace old new via labor mutual aid. Another reminder overwhelming amount people die simply vaccinated. Basic hygiene sanitation helped flu too. Yes, that‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs know coronaviruses long term effects. suppose shouldn‚Äôt used word ‚Äúconfirms,‚Äù still haven‚Äôt seen evidence vaccinated people spread virus, least aren‚Äôt already showing symptoms COVID. evidence far consistently indicating nonsymptomatic vaccinated people spread virus. It‚Äôs cute (and little sad) don‚Äôt even know projection is, want use protect trump anyway. think hail mary get fence sitters vaccinate. really care though. Whatever takes get shots arms. Right let‚Äôs give shot soemthing don‚Äôt know long term effects instead. least COVID we‚Äôve able study year. vaccine matter months we‚Äôve new discoveries periodically. state, got vaccinated first day eligible. line cutting. Got second one week. I'm ""fully"" protected another 2-3 weeks. 

The people vaccinated ones defying requests wear masks. would nice figure way distinguish stupid anti maskers tho  get Joe aces book too. 

I guess think armed soldiers going door door vaccines hand ready force non compliant get vaccinated good idea, lord mercy!

I believe vaccines available willing best country unvaxxed get us herd immunity hard way. read Indian variant 50% contagious UK variant. UK variant alone requires something like 80% vaccinated reach herd immunity, I'm assuming may closer 90% vaccinated reach herd immunity Indian variant becomes ""Transmission variant currently faster B.1.1.7 variant,"" U.K.'s Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies wrote Friday document. ""It realistic possibility much 50% that's correct, would mean B.1.617.2 225% transmissible original SARS-CoV-2 strains, would make B.1.617.2 contagious one planet. Good overcoming reservations. get chance, please talk sense brother?

Or share changed mind long term effects would helpful :) mother's school district teaches announced email proof vaccination school board, administration, longer wear masks teaching.

So Monday first day since March 13 2020 teachers longer wear masks teaching. might keep mine allergy season. wind blows puff pollen comes trees, I'm misery. Masks significantly lessened severity me. 

I also plan keep transit train disgusting. Gonna need link that, friend work. think I'll that. never gets factored herd estimates should. It‚Äôs reliant vaccination rates, seen Israel essentially reaching herd immunity ad ~55% vaccination rate. Apologies asking question that's answered thousand times I'm sure, can't find link know saw day two ago.

There's lots discussion hesitancy go maskless we're sure whether vaccinated people transmit, swear several people posted link study discussed point (and remember right, suggested transmission vaccinated people area concern). going mad? anyone point recent reliable information this? thats problem Youre wrong ok. idk people claim believe science downvoting this. scientific fact vaccines? seems like yesterday CDC saying wear two masks.

The timing CDC relaxing rules (horrible jobs number) makes seem political. Hope it‚Äôs not. Demonizing probably shitty approach persuasion.

It's interesting reddit nuanced sometimes. times... Lmao not, bout tomorrow morning? ;D agree they've signaling super majority figures whole time, saying 80% knowing know (eg: 1/3rd Americans likely infected vaccinations efficacy shots) seems anti-scientific me. taking natural infection account, would imply total protection requirement 86 87% R0 7.5 reach herd immunity.   low vaccination states mask mandates anyway though. clarify? One says 60% Americans plan getting already gotten vaccine, days 80% Canadians.

Is something contradicts I've said? bet got massive influx calls/tweets/messages people asking WTF changed minds.

People hate wearing masks (like myself, though always required) waiting day months. I'm ecstatic. I'll still places still wanting wear one still wonderful day.

And thanks scientists worked vaccines. know one personally, send card something. :) exactly happen. I‚Äôd put money it. know CDC doesn‚Äôt? trust government

Same thing conservatives, don‚Äôt know alternative CDC had. could continue push idea we‚Äôre ‚Äústill learning‚Äù transmission dissuades normal, empathetic people don‚Äôt see risk severe Covid getting vaccinated. people know haven‚Äôt vaccinated wear masks/socially distance say hadn‚Äôt done thought vaccines didn‚Äôt stop transmission therefore pointless young age great health. would also undermine CDC‚Äôs credibility LOT evidence contrary now. could admit vaccinated significantly helps protect others accept unvaccinated going lie it.

And honestly don‚Äôt think lies matter much end. Literally everyone still wearing mask live like always yesterday. many places one wearing mask time anti-vaxxers always refused picked fights store employees try get put one on. Case numbers falling quickly, weather warm enough people enjoy outdoors now, vaccinations still ongoing. wish people wouldn‚Äôt assholes don‚Äôt think need overreact like hindsight Texas‚Äô reopening months ago. Even did, supposed scare me? call free birth control. videos corona youtube get bombed dislikes? It‚Äôs CDC??? I‚Äôm pretty sure know they‚Äôre talking about. Probably good idea listen scientists. Many people still can‚Äôt won‚Äôt get vaccine though. It‚Äôs problem. getting stupid. hate polarized partisan people become, especially last decade, affect public health. partisanship, driven increasing unstable republican party, literally killing us. hear news? spike proteins vaccines actually causing people harm virus plus young people healthy risk virus anyways. (/s) work service...I think masks beyond pointless...But wear one work...

If come get service don‚Äôt wear one, you‚Äôre biggest piece shit we‚Äôll take care day...guaranteed... Man, almost like away two party system.... wrong, Good know! think going average seasonal numbers, rather last winter specifically.  means longer take baby grocery shopping. young mask vaccinated. reasonable. What's unreasonable everyone wearing masks hit herd immunity? Locked down, no, simple mask? huge burden protect people? People selfish. mean makes pure statistical sense children would de facto spend time parents. get killed friends strangers often they're constant contact people.

Number one cause death pregnant women husbands murdering them. There's another irrelevant statistic collection. parents listened CDC pediatricians basically begging us every year please please get kids flu vaccine lot kids die take seriously, even though vaccine kinda effective?

Now say, ""OK, wait send kid enclosed classroom get COVID vaccine like month school starts fall?"" answer NO, mandatory in-class instruction, masks optional. individual wants avoid maskless places abundance caution, feel free so. 

No one stoping see weeks pans out.

Look Texas, Florida, New Hampshire new Axios/Ipsos poll finds 63% Americans say already received Covid-19 vaccine **or soon made available them.**

Currently 46% Americans least one dose. say again. say again.   ‚ÄúI absolutely don‚Äôt trust people what‚Äôs right wear masks they‚Äôre vaccinated. that‚Äôs going put children risk.‚Äù

This. 2.5 year old can‚Äôt get vaccinated. mother vaccinated. keep wearing masks set good example. first run this. wife fully vaccinated participated community garage sale, stopping quite houses. didn‚Äôt need masks, outside really wearing 4 year old obviously vaxxed put mask super confused didn‚Äôt any. put probably continue sake it‚Äôs wrath mom, maybe secretly get vaccinated. basically walk pharmacy Walmart get shot little wait lot places now. sure you‚Äôre sarcastic, mRNA vaccines approved December. We‚Äôve vaccinating 6 months. Good know! got shot Wednesday mind-altering substances since then, couple days beforehand. article seems focused Japan numbers. passed winter season spike fairly quickly..

Japanese people mask that‚Äôs it. lot unconcerned, still workplace atmosphere, go izakayas drink after. unsure stalling vaccine rollout, hope reel though. 5G speeds going charts! might be, seen times proud subreddit. 

They always going drop masks. Hell probably weren‚Äôt wearing first place. It‚Äôs unfortunate reality situation can‚Äôt get mad cards. play hand dealt.  So, everyone concerned potential long term negative effects covid. Yet super OK giving child vaccine fastest vaccine created deployed history, 0 research area potential long term side effects. Eh, bought whole 5 micron stuff slowed adoption mask, created illusion 6 ft safe.

The CDC definitely err, quite often important matters. particular decision steeped hope motivates people vaccinate good faith (uhoh) less preventing COVID spread. Mass transit mask usage mandated per federal law moment. fortunately vaccine annually kids 16 take seasonal flu. require schools kindergartens make part OSHA, basically businness less 80% vaccinated employees pay fees safety ratings company insurance (sorry sounds mumble jumble, europe don¬¥t know exactly whole workplace safety thing works europe) Wearing mask soooo taxing mental health. walmart. Literally worst place shop. Filled dregs humanity. Title literally doesn‚Äôt say anything allowing parents choose cautious. Yes, said Pfizer Moderna. 

No need attack though. Pfizer made vaccine Biden. much!! Rather working dick infertile dick lol Wearing tiny piece cloth face locked down. Cuomo takes long long time make decisions rest state. took months even seperate state regions specific rules laws start pandemic. upstate individual clear Cuomo care upstate. Two big factors people keep touting ‚Äúmost kids don‚Äôt get sick COVID!‚Äù:

1) Things like drowning, car accidents etc effectively mitigated. It‚Äôs even risk across kids. 

2) Actually it‚Äôs similar point: knowing population level risk death serious illness COVID doesn‚Äôt tell kid‚Äôs individual risk. There‚Äôs way predict it. individual risk might 1 100, 1 1000. don‚Äôt know. bad (and rough range COVID‚Äôs IFR). Pretty much. don‚Äôt buy groceries winter? comes think CDC made determination people overall get vaccinated lowered restriction, long run likely bring lower case loads overall staying mask mode indefinitely‚Ä¶I think people forget ineffective masks overall, reduction transmission really high you‚Äôre double masking you‚Äôve got good fit wearing properly (and many people think really properly, majority much one). Single masking helps honestly much light contagious variants come US. Plus built solution ‚Äî cases plummeting wish states this. infection numbers going jump again. Vaccinations way across country, point everyone vaccinated getting vaccinated definitely wanted it, everyone else either lazy don‚Äôt want it. 

There appointments open everywhere California, can‚Äôt say states looking huge drop vaccinations it‚Äôs safe assume appointments open. You‚Äôre *forced* keep home. It‚Äôs *choice.* could give 2 fucks point people get sick kill themselves. fuck people done right afraid appeasing assholes. love people play ""unknown long-term effects"" vaccine (OK, true, know could happen 5 years) FAR proven safe hundreds millions people... yet flip 180¬∫¬†and totally ignore unknown long-term effects COVID, already know deadly virus killed millions people, caused long-term effects tens millions survived.  right. Virus plenty run come mutations vaccines effective far. 

With declining spread, odds crazy mutation much lower past. 

This trusting science, consider probability make decision. hold .0001% chance something happening. really hope do! M√©xico still incredibly severe lack vaccines, millions would go asap american City get shot! states adopt guidance mask wear still required hit critical thresshold vaccinated population. Something like ""The masks stay everyone 70% fuckers get vaccine."" Make mistakes, America best medical technology best doctors, things available 99%? Hahaha! blows mind 2020, putting people, basically, honor system considered viable option. Exactly. Last spring/summer county officials came told residents local businesses owners could consider Covid precautions strictly voluntary state mandates would enforced within county. Masks always optional public spaces local businesses could decide whether require property not. result, mask wearing minimal here. surprise fully vaccinated rate around 30%. increase? Maybe little. absolutely shocked get anywhere near 50% vaccinated here. unvaccinated get vaccines CDC said take masks do, local officials told never wear masks want to. understand tie lifting mask mandates concrete metric, like low case count example? That's something worked towards nebulous. surges, either regionally nationally, going impossible convince people put masks back on. can't help worry decision going lead preventable deaths. Science built trust. That's eerily close saying ""have faith"" antithetical gets scientific method. plenty experts disagree decision dispense mask guidance (or least timing).

Let's also pretend CDC always right. wrong several times past year.

If individual wants avoid maskless places abundance caution, feel free so. We'll see weeks pans out. really get sick flu cold know. I'm feeling well usually hang over. 

I got nose mist one last year mostly free would prefer get weird looks people get flu. NBA got cancelled shit got real. could feel air, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget it. Germany, certain Vaccines required want kids attend Kindergarten school.

Sure hardcore antivaxxer people find doc grant kid ""can¬¥t vaccinated medical reasons"" cases leads high level vaccination.

Moderna best work far away Canadian border, get vaccines facility - even though U.S. running 70 million doses surplus mRNA vaccines.

I would love get surplus, even allowing Moderna ship U.S. facility would huge us.

I worry odds us getting surplus U.S. supply go pass first doses next week, maybe people think really need help. might true extent, we've also lockdown long time, I've gone stir crazy. million doses extra month could speed whole process weeks, would best sizable number people apathetic vaccine also want covid also willing lie. people new guidance targeting. bet there's bump appointments week. people deep conspiracy Kool aid never getting vaccine speed us finish line good level community immunity. immune compromised effective vaccine, I'd isolate next months better let linger limbo next year. Making vaccinated mask science denial hurting messaging.

I small kids. I'll careful taking indoors places requiring masks. I'm also worried catching covid ultimately unavoidable. risk disability death taking swimming. schools require vaccine. stupid portion population refuses since concetrated, pockets US keep giving slowly die off, kids getting push us imto herd immunity territory overall.

However data lacking much you‚Äôd still able carry spread unvaccinated people. almost completely safe now, anti-vaxxers, immunocompromised, children, marginalized communities ones still risk everyone returns ‚Äúbusiness usual‚Äù without precautions attention drawn away getting vaccinated. Pretty sure vermont leads vaccine rates. would 50%+ people continue wait 10% still limbo, continue masking/distancing want wait  CDC control fiscal policy. understand masks preventing living life. We‚Äôre 50 different countries lot ways. Sometimes works great. pandemic? much. Same, dozens peer reviewed papers indicate outdoor transmission extraordinarily rare even unvaccinated. March 2020 thousands Americans left Europe went back states. It‚Äôs unlikely large number brought virus back.  Masks never really made safe first place. always pretty weak protection (well home made surgical masks weak; medical grade PPE works really well). Better nothing, enough stop virus. 

Vaccines effective contrast. 

The benefit everyone wearing mask dwarfed percent population getting vaccine.

Worrying masks now, like worrying passing enough life jackets titanic sinking life boats going half full. Life jacket better nothing, you‚Äôll still freeze death water. Someday decision held textbook example disastrous public health messaging. guidance interpreted sync (see Wal-Mart lifting mask requirement). utter lack CDC understand prior announcement astounding. significant fraction US, CDC effectively announced 1) COVID 2) masks never really necessary begin 3) need fence consider vaccination. Further, CDC unraveled year begging/educating US public masks effective tool prevent spread. children 12 remain vulnerable population? US government employee public health arena man grew Deep South, hurts soul. state, yes. mask mandate social distancing completely eliminated June 11th Endemics don‚Äôt go away

They reach herd immunity. Getting rid infectious disease possible via vaccination. probably going happen coronavirus due vaccine reluctance, possible. 

I expected us mask free July 4th latest. timing CDC announcement surprised me. Less half Americans fully vaxxed. people waiting second shot, lot people still anti-vax. Keeping mask mandate little longer could helped nudged numbers up.  good protecting wearers?

Asking cloth masks insertable filters btw. we're planning booster fall/ winter? blacks barely GOP... top 5 vaccinated country, 4 Covid surge. Common denominator use China vaccines. clarify, many studies show masks protect wearer. original line ‚Äúprotecting others,‚Äù early pandemic. walking around maskless along

Not live, haven't. 

I walked store yesterday immediately noticed unmasked people past year everyone I've seen every store masked. resistance last year back April non-maskers lost, decided grief worth it, complied.

We needed move know CDC wait one month people get vaccinated. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs coincidence not, didn‚Äôt pull wallet pay anything. simply waved hand credit card machine. blame chips vaccine.  Long term, agree.

Ultimately, think data support us hanging onto mask mandates little longer short term. least long enough people getting vaccines fully kick in, minimum. 

The largest age group approved time vaccine reach full effectiveness. 12+ ages started getting first shots.

I get may quickly reach herd immunity levels, least let initial rush vaccines take hold. CDC telling us wait two weeks second shot relax restrictions, they're following advice, without giving strong reasons why. learned one way humans largely untrustworthy, selfish, dangerous.

If trusted second would vaccinated people would unmasking problem. don't.

It's less I'm worried breakthrough infection, we're basically giving arguing anti-mask people. win can't bothered hold standard longer. going see (at least marginally) increased infection rates, going denial others early grave. mention mutation risk.

This political move, though I'll concede likely made encourage people get shot. practice equivalent telling kid get ice cream homework, kid lied number assignments get ice cream anyway. kid going homework without told going regardless ice cream. lying child gets rewarded alongside them.gets rewarded alongside them. Cuomo follows science following science means doesn‚Äôt get positive clout people seeing one lift masks nothing science. CDC studied this, concluded fully vaxxed people longer benefit wearing masks. unlikely get covid, virtually impossible spread, longer need wear masks. Good work.  Apparently dropping mask mandate they‚Äôre going natural immunity. clue. Maybe brigade here. 

Irony probably missed people used get sick lot due around lot people jobs. haven‚Äôt sick going 2 years masking covid precautions. I‚Äôm definitely going keep wearing flights crowded stores, it‚Äôs amazing going long without sick! second dose 8 weeks. It‚Äôs really good know spacing works better! Yeah, looking methodology used data 2010-2017, numbers factored in. would need wear one around known vaccinated people workplace? I'm talking public. That's nothing change. Long term side affects may may exist vaccine. Long term affects virus definitely exist (unless kills you). Politicians always bend wind primary objective reelection Kids would basically free breeding ground yet another mutation without it, pretty big drawback leaving fully unvaccinated seems like implying done. Bummer. people refuse get vaccinated overlap strongly people refuse wear masks. That's then. people right thing. makes happy trans girl anti-androgens 7 months. Also fully vaccinated well blind faith Canadian exceptionalism? Okay Wait, what? really new conspiracy theory?

I‚Äôm Facebook, miss lot crazier things.  wear anyways. two people close inner circle contracting Covid fully vaccinated, definitely continue wearing mask indoors. childrens safety, really changed level comfort planned camps activities summer. Masked crowded space feels lot different unmasked, several years vaccine age. would even verify twelve year olds age ? like government listed photo ids &amp; birth certificates would exclude migrants. Like mask mandate honor system unless clearly 12+ everyone get vaccinated Group 2 eligible something? jumped vaccination 2 days eligible I'm still 2 weeks away fully vaccinated... Businesses still require masks enter. want gomout park go hiking, cool. need run errands, need mask can't get in. CDC can't tell businesses run businesses, keep masking till places want go start allowing maskless people in. There‚Äôs still programs community taking things ultra ultra slow still things incredibly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù ‚Äúdistanced‚Äù. don‚Äôt get it. People rely programs businesses totally understand wanting safety, point people they‚Äôre depriving themselves. think level fear instilled us past year also making difficult return normal assess risk. think healthy thing, get wrong, needed clear communication try get adults teens alter behavior. reality young kids (&lt;10) unlikely severe COVID. Like, top 10 causes death group COVID believe #7 8. stuff like car crashes flu (COVID less deadly group Flu). 

I'm COVID skeptic anti-mask/anti-vax person. lived last 15 months home leaving buy groceries per week. vaccinated day 1 available group. I'm trying claim fear COVID unhealthy. think media done really good job making us worried especially young kids low risk kind glossed discussed, applying bit skewed worry kids. 

In words, shelter kids due risks catching flu involved car crash. 12+ vaccinated think opening sensible. would also agree probably waited 3-4 weeks 12+ group little time get shots. Accurate. right turned pandemic political shit show Wrong, would discriminatory practice. legal US deny basic issues like renewing passports/licenses/etc. especially hiring. We're living Saddam's Iraq get 5G scanner. reliable way identify vaccinations. explain ‚Äú1000x LESS‚Äù protection translates percentage efficacy? sounds like you‚Äôre saying vaccine causes children less resistant COVID-19, doesn‚Äôt make sense me.  vaccines proven effective every variant popped far. 

Michigan savaged B117 UK variant enough citizens vaccinated. rates falling cliff! already know coronavirus severe consequences including death. sorry. 

Keep good work Vietnam. It‚Äôs getting harder contain variant.

[covid worries return   NY 9th vaccinated state country 50% first dose. behind  Amd US fatality rate 2% even worse. kind person willing sacrifice 6 million people? Bingo.... may anecdotal went store today people still wearing masks. I'm vaccinated sign door said could. live South Carolina expecting people wear one. without kids?  hilarious! stores adjusted guidance still require masks all. least around lot getting shots school. getting downvotes but...aren't right? would trusted CDC implicitly fucked beginning Trump able infiltrate organization politicize it. one remembers that? 

It's going take long time trust CDC again. say someone believes science, taken vaccine, taken pandemic seriously. whole shebang. 

I'm never going forget wear masks messaging beginning. excuse that. one mistake.

The CDC needs earn trust again. Truth...

Don't know ya got voted Texas mostly maskless months numbers still dropping. Freaking politics Really, part? I‚Äôve worked formula deadly COVID given time working fatality rate. also used formula prove vaccination program U.K. decreased fatality rate third.

**D = Daily deaths day want examine**

**C = daily case number 21 days day want examine**

**FR = Fatality rate**

**(D / C) * 100 = FR**

All data sourced U.K. government‚Äôs website December 2020 worst day COVID cases UK‚Äôs pandemic, 81,523 people tested positive. led 19 January 2021 UK‚Äôs deadliest day, COVID-19 killing 1,358 people. Therefore, best way test efficacy vaccine see amount deaths 21 days given date comparable peak pandemic.

The death total 19 January 1.66% case total 29 December. therefore assume that, worst point, COVID-19 U.K. 1.66% fatality rate. Since assume contemporary cases amongst unvaccinated, majority younger average vulnerabilities, hypothesise fatality rate lowered last months susceptible hospitalised dying COVID received least one vaccine dose, many cases two.

On 15 May, 2,027 positive tests 7 deaths. Positive cases increased 8% since last week, deaths decreased roughly amount. encouraging, need bear mind average, takes 21 days COVID case become COVID death, post written first day widespread testing Indian variant. get current data, must look positive tests 24 April compare fatality rate pandemic‚Äôs peak.

On 24 April, 1,524 people U.K. tested positive. 1,524 cases became 7 deaths three weeks later, means UK‚Äôs COVID fatality rate time writing 0.46%, less third peak U.K.‚Äôs outbreak. current trend cases less deaths continues, golden number fall even lower.

This number governments looking deciding whether lift restrictions, comparing things worse. know???? flip side, viruses way immunocompromised people might breaking even. Go California!!  parent child young vaccinated, appreciate caution. would agree fact negative outcomes covid stop hospitalization death. See: covid long haulers experiencing effects virus several months ""recovering"". Count 50%...I got second shot yesterday happy af! Wife, parents, parents fully vaccinated. two sons getting second doses next Friday. That‚Äôs gotta comforting parents kids die COVID-19. 

Not. 

Vaccinate kids, help protect kids can‚Äôt vaccinated medical reasons. even car then? Eh, it‚Äôs symbol pandemic. done masks means we‚Äôre almost done covid major national crisis. agree masks weren‚Äôt big deal, get people glad done them. rules gym?

What rules work? everything powers spread disinformation virus.  Yeah, still drive wear seatbelt people cars don‚Äôt. risk them.     really, I'm lazy  I‚Äôm really upset didn‚Äôt get 5G update vaccine shots. hoping use WiFi hotspot. 50 thousand 39. rare. Unrelated, question. 

Can fully vaccinated friend (I‚Äôm also fully vaccinated) hang indoors private setting (my apartment)!with masks week? interested wanted know safe. two weeks second dose. annoying go shopping see entire families crowding place making social distancing nearly impossible pandemic. accordance best practices, health org guidelines, plain common sense, families babies young children shopping together first place. would seriously appreciate everyone dragging unvaccinated children babies store I'm best handle shopping rarely quickly possible leaving rest family home minimize contributing crowding. 

Both practices (allowing unmasking indoor spaces know unvaccinated people lie vaccinated, entire family units going shopping crowded indoor environments unvaccinated children babies) equally irresponsible.  Unless got J&amp;J, probably good shape. J&amp;J lowest efficacy different technology Moderna/Pfizer. J&amp;J still great option LOT people, probably likely need prefer catch transmit virus. Luckily J&amp;J isn‚Äôt widely used, even protected closer herd immunity. wear masks forever? Great way give incentive get vaccine then. Wtf read AFAIR CDC/Faucci number around 21% nationally would bet would vary significantly different areas populations. places might much higher since population samples NYC 27% (with neighborhoods 40%) last spring. get either. soon CDC said vaccinated drop mask hell broken loose sub LOL.

Suddenly science mean shit, way people feel now. mean 180 respecting science, weird. Political ideology polite. Willful ignorance accurate. Let‚Äôs pretend it‚Äôs difference opinion. It‚Äôs facts vs fiction. also lied severity virus politicized entire year. applicable Covid:

1) vaccine
2) mask
3) distance
4) outdoors hit another vaccination record Canada today. imagine we'll next week supply increases open eligibility. think otherwise? know slow eventually - probably around 65%? we've already shown rates lack hesitancy already differentiating U.S. 

I quite understand *your* point. think Canada, 43% one dose, peaked vaccination rate? Like, think we're gonna hit anymore record days?  happened follow science? CDC says ok vaccinated people unmask outdoors. Even indoors actually. protected enough live like pre covid times  Seems weird though case much higher source listed, said 2019-2020 unusually high. expect underprojection case. tremendous burden wear piece cloth face 20 mins store order avoid dying. that's choice make. hope everyone's sake difference right answer wrong answer ultimately negligible. Texas COVID-wise moment, hm? 1 50 thousand 39. Seems pretty significant me. smidge faster Kent variant, still makes overwhelming majority cases UK, there's much worry government's scientific advisory group emergencies (Sage) says ""realistic possibility"" could spread 50% faster, higher estimates 60% coming India, based published genetic sequences viral samples clear representative overall picture estimates problems would really start variant 40% transmissible ""would lead substantial resurgence hospitalisations"" put pressure uncertainty reminiscent last year new variant Kent first detected raised questions approach controlling important remember situation last 19 million people - third adult population - jabs vaccine. Another 17 million one. Vaccines weakening, eliminating, link infection severe overall cases also far lower. Office National Statistics estimates fewer 50,000 people currently virus. figure 1.25 million start year. Currently around 1,000 people hospital concern vaccines great perfect everyone vulnerable one. another wave cases combination relaxing new variant worrying number people could still end predictions crystal balls. Earlier mathematical models predicted summer wave, suddenly became far optimistic became clear vaccinated people less likely spread virus.

‚Ä¶ optimist thinks Starbucks doesn‚Äôt think term Barista includes mask enforcer. doubt Baristas good anyway. stop grief employees.  Using children propaganda, miserable. Humans die life. die drinking Pepsi, Pepsi? hope kids never forget put last every decision point pandemic. Apparently, politically driven goes personal beliefs. Funny works. Let‚Äôs hope so! lot doctors time keep best practices due large patient loads. probably best finds research reputable groups brings ask questions. vaccine directly reduces risk 1/20th, 1/4th variants like California variant (95%, 75%).

Going bar hanging unvaccinated people far 20X 4X higher staying home unvaccinated. 

This level community spread matters. adjusts odds. You‚Äôre right, do. That‚Äôs seat belts child proof caps. one asking stop driving car. asking wear mask indoors vaccine available everyone. make entire schools nut-free allergic kids - want safety everyone, wear mask *inside public places* (which we‚Äôve year already) months. Sorry live anti-science state ‚òπÔ∏è also optimistic assume 30% antibodies.

I necessarily think wrong think actual idea I'm hesitant rely high numbers based guessing. great probably varies drastically based region. know of. 

We know many people actually caught virus are/were asymptomatic. people symptoms, extremely mild ones (like weak cold) tested. individuals spread disease others, capable become reinfected severe case. Vast majority 12-year olds donot passports. tax ultra wealthy corporations? 30 years Limbaugh ranting ear, get. :( I'm pretty sure vaccine gluten free sister anti vaxx idiot works one stores. proudly celebrated work longer requires masks family group chat. told told can't around son unless masks I'm bad guy.

On side this, went maskless Walmart today awesome I'm worried 5 month old daughter vaccinated anytime soon. part mom worry, chances even gets fine, first baby pandemic traumatic me. Britain big moments national unity well though. press good whipping Dunkirk spirit made sure pandemic never became political. [John Mellencamp - Crumblin' walls come tumblin down.."" Ben Shapiro show Friday 

""So lefts idols Biden Fauci say take masks vaccinated, take masks, I've saying since February, science there""

He really lacks much self awareness realize many people received vaccines within past 3 weeks. People protect well possible, still lot people risk lot people refuse protect risk. Viruses don‚Äôt care ‚Äúpersonal choice‚Äù‚Äîthey function entirely opportunity. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated, continue wear masks indoors children vaccinated don‚Äôt completely trust narrative children less risk. don‚Äôt fully understand long-term impacts virus human body, don‚Äôt want gamble health. 

Also, parents don‚Äôt get vaccinated don‚Äôt wear masks, could end exposing kids turn expose people‚Äôs kids. kids returning on-campus schooling couple months I‚Äôm deeply concerned risk poses. I‚Äôm also concerned possibility children becoming vessel virus mutate something truly dangerous them. 

All makes angry showed many people willing callously disregard safety others preserve comfort. happens states who've said they're keeping mask mandate still? stores still follow mask rules? Sure bud, advising someone seek opinion medical professional knows child ignorant. world live in? Why?  trusting government, regardless democrat republican, another. know it‚Äôs easy blame side, horrible job building trust. Oof. seems like would severely limit number 12 year olds getting vaccine. like people attitude ‚Äújfc it‚Äôs mask get it‚Äù tell people curbside grocery store (which you‚Äôre high risk anyway masks no) it‚Äôs inconvenience‚Ä¶.we‚Äôve telling people work months curbside don‚Äôt want wear mask‚Ä¶now we‚Äôll probably tell everyone wants everybody else wear one tremendous burden, longer required necessary. There's reason vaccinated person wear it. also made point public it.... soon realized vaccination would help country successor charge him, 180'd touting vaccine.

Even conservatives know vaccine point, 100% got message Trump would rather see vaccination rate go up, fell line accordingly   Pretty much entire comment. data long term effects kids? There‚Äôs data 1 3 getting COVID getting mental disorders later on. Asymptomatic infections immunity, actually account significant portion transmissions. seen anything indicate significant portion population ""naturally immune"".

It important also remember that, short term, even fully vaccinated people still breathe harbor virus nasal passages potentially spread people. actually know sure long ""short term"" is, imagine aligns know surface contamination virus general: probably 1-2 hours, possibly 8 worst case. EDIT: wanted add that, understand it, mainly concern crowded environments. think lot people traumatized past year half, want face another big change direction. 

It's kind nice told do, I've heard people say feel comfortable without showing faces. revel able lord others. really scared coverage. Whatever reasons are, going take time get people back reality accept COVID-19 vaccine covered.   Doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt still circulating DMs posts stay getting taken down. It‚Äôs like playing Whack-A-Mole. Let rephrase that. must wife's friend believes. wife still tell vaccinated, said friend would freak found out. Fixing environment requires transitioning green economy, needs lots funding. funding paid somehow.

Progressive ideas often go hand-in-hand higher taxes pay them. necessary good bad, intellectually dishonest want lots government action low taxes. Umm CDC recommendation you‚Äôre vaccinated don‚Äôt need mask. you‚Äôre vaccinated it‚Äôs almost impossible pass said kid, would wearing mask. 

Your argument makes sense you‚Äôre claiming neither vaccine masks work, case. vaccinated don‚Äôt significant risk. Anyone get one. young, doesn‚Äôt present significant risk. 

If wanna weird still hide away, feel free. follows statistics science. exactly said post. played ""unknown dangers"" vaccine, ignoring some-known-and-some-unknown dangers COVID, including long-term effects it.

Why would unknown long-term effects vaccine outweigh unknown long-term effects COVID, even kids?

The short-term (0 vaccine deaths vs. COVID deaths, even kids), mid-term (no serious side effects vs. long-COVID), long-term (unknown both) favors vaccines COVID. Even kids. Yeah, countries would probably say ""sorry, 89 years can't give ECMO need machines &lt;70 age range."" paid vaccine? know people go ways. like wearing mask, necessary. I'm fully vaccinated, two months. longer necessary, I'll first go shopping without one. Yeah way US going push vaccine passport, FL TX already banned it, know US ports entry Federal state jurisdiction enforce vaccine passports foreigners. really hope also drops social distancing. That's best way help bars. yet reached date 1st general population adults considered fully vaccinated (5 6 weeks 19 April 2021 based Pfizer Moderna timing). much longer wait though. CDC could've green waiting till 24 31 May. What's another 11 18 days? numbers flat wrong. Hopefully lies, definitely wrong. 60% US adults least 1 shot, 46% total population, including 50 million children still eligible. Canada good job, still 35% population one dose, US number fully vaccinated.  Political idiocy. number could change &amp; rise depending quickly thoroughly world gets vaccinated, vs many variants thing. General hesitance guess.

Figured can't take mask getting what's point I'm young healthy dude zero underlying conditions.  get two dozen day ago 180 one day after?

I think says clear idea extent infection. vaccinated adults. context 9,000/95,000,000 black voters democrats. What‚Äôs excuse vaccination rates low PoC? don‚Äôt blame access; that‚Äôs complete myth.  ""get vaccinated get fucked"" 


That's point nothing motivates people faster immediate doom. Easing would allow people rationalize &amp; decide whether proceed. cliche throwing kid pool teach swim. either learn quickly drown, harsh one time prepare. 


We'll see happens cautiously hopeful it'll get fire peoples ass get jabbed. Nope said would lighten restrictions enough got vaccinated I‚Äôm sure people would, it‚Äôs risk see reason Haha exactly. There‚Äôs absolutely logic people. boggles mind. Whitmer seems damned damned doesn‚Äôt. Rescinding won‚Äôt make Reddit happy skews left, so... well let‚Äôs forgot people plotted kidnapping. according CDC. science? kid probably pretty jacked immune system already (normal vax sched).

&amp;#x200B;

and first dose pretty potent 2-3 weeks.

Impact effectiveness mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine SARS-CoV-2 infections COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, deaths following nationwide vaccination campaign Israel: observational study using national surveillance data  can‚Äôt force people get vaccines won‚Äôt get one without incentive. incentive might get sick otherwise lockdown forever Spring Sucks! here. Allergies everything, tons medication etc... mention (a) needle driven deep muscle tissue (b) 5G waves everyone paranoid can't even make skin much less couple cm flesh. agree wholeheartedly. haven‚Äôt hit minimum threshold herd immunity adults let alone kids. 

Now loosening restrictions, kids aren‚Äôt even close herd immunity vaccinations. Kids known ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù schools known ‚Äúsuper spreader sites‚Äù

And isn‚Äôt don‚Äôt faith Fauci CDC‚Äôs assessment safe normally. 

Just that, America, shouldn‚Äôt lift mask restrictions safe so. idiots can‚Äôt ruin everyone, know 5G rocks now! :P mandate doesn‚Äôt end June 2nd though son asthma young vaccine. I‚Äôm pissed abruptly sprung us. Would weeks warning big deal? feel like caved crazies make life much difficult families like mine. Fuck people caved selfish crazy assholes constantly pressured them. Ohio, 12 year old prescription get one.  understanding 70% vaccinated goal already takes cases account. It‚Äôs need 70% plus natural immunity percentage order reach herd immunity. don‚Äôt bring baby Stupidity ideology, lack ideology. answer doesn't. go see someone coughing store I'll probably put mask sake wanting get sick really threat us. unvaccinated crowd deal consequences choice shit. platform ideology plenty science denial, inevitable. would still fine vaccinated. See Yankees outbreak right doubt efficacy. Specifically new strains resistant vaccines.

Yea, agreed. new variants pop within US anyways updated mask policies, making likely. 175 million Americans unvaccinated, issue arise without closed borders well. Besides Indian variant example already UK, US closed borders UK. variant make here, like dominant B1.1.7 UK strain significant degree. something like 95% deaths 60 crowd

With 175 million still unvaccinated, 33 million officially infected last year, potential surge. bad it'll be, depends evenly distributed vaccinations across population. large pockets/communities unvaccinated people, they'll feel surge. less worried deaths spread due current strains, worried Escape variants popping may sabotage vaccination efforts. next give better picture resilient community spread is. front camera. look Fauci CDCs comments masks Feb 2020, you‚Äôd realize always war masks, sides political spectrum. Nope, worse. would get booster every month go back pre March 2020  Fair enough, sure would even look like. ‚ÄúGet vaccine businesses reopen full capacity ditch masks‚Äù already table people still don‚Äôt seem game vaccine. also think best scientists remain purely objective try cater demographic can. would say public health officials ones outreach language reach vaccine hesitant people cruelty point. I'd like see definitive data masks actually anything begin with.

Is feasible good health policy. tell put mask leave. dont trespassing private property breaking law.  many years, I'm relatively young, I've flu many times without issue, years past often shortage flu vaccines. kids entire year school virtually wore masks day school protect elderly. asks rules indoors save kids, guys say fair? fair mental sacrifice kids adults? 

How huge sacrifice ask mask mandates indoor stores/locations TWO months? aren‚Äôt asking shut economy, got stop things kids got comfortable doing, way keep mask kids 2. parents getting downvoted, won‚Äôt find sympathy here. Head r/Parenting Except ""society live in"" one static thing. places honest people, not. like dishonest people honest now. CDC's advice written, completely sound. Additionally, people impacted numerically dishonesty willfully unvaxxed people. feel need protect them. Give another month. We‚Äôre close. They‚Äôre already studies. love Biden's habit under-promising over-delivering.

Don't forget, habit taking credit others work. vaccination rate pretty consistent first shot Trump's last day office today (Nice drop numbers us slowly hitting ceiling).

That said, odds much favor. wear watch necklace never liked feel them. wear required ceremony dress code, never enjoyed them.

Now forced wear piece clothing year like forced dress every day. hardest thing world? No, annoyance everyone live relief ditch them.

Maybe consider odd one caring? children 2 can't even wear mask? Others wearing protection. really mind-boggling decision CDC. Dewine, Hogan, Baker may well best leaders entire pandemic worry people lie wear mask overblown mind. lying bad faith people care mandates already violating it. 

This policy change much bad faith lying crowd. follow mandates wore masks chins fake gesture. policy sends positive signal vaccinated also paints positive image vaccines work allow society return normal. want people trusted CDC got vaccinated feel like nothing power play big government control them. positive re-enforcement also help society future increase trust vaccines way move pandemics.

This positive message vaccinated crowd. Bad faith crowd keep they've doing. vaccines work variants, too.

Nothing changed ...except...we vaccinated fear anti vax idiots longer! understand that? Don‚Äôt discount value psychology sociology. inform happens policies enacted. That‚Äôs important know whether vaccines work. *sigh* risk death thing worry covid, goes age groups. Long-term effects MIS-C risks too. send cdc links, I'm arguing science death rates involved here. 

Personally there's even big risk kid, I'm lucky enough options keep home shopping whatnot that's case everyone.

All I'm getting wearing mask effortless normal now, see point recommendation way enforce general public settings.   That‚Äôs works junior. mostly rural county TX, one ones that's really big daytrip weekend tourism people cities suburbs. felt really uneasy small town festival wildflower related tourism going past months. know city people coming know little regard given pandemic here, care. there's reason drove suburbs city run errands got vaccinated. Agreed. spike summer southern states decided open saw infections dropped precautions rejecting.

I‚Äôm vaccinated staying unmasked businesses least know potential spike.  get vaccinated what‚Äôs happening COVID vaccinations right now? anticipated possibility yearly vaccinations COVID? Don‚Äôt already higher vaccination rate COVID flu? 

Truth told, think flu deadly. least par COVID, prior evidence indicates without vaccination far worse symptoms, flu even cause pandemic (see last century). 

Now vaccine developed COVID, nearly 50% vaccinated, it‚Äôs similar flu terms danger individuals. Yes, people vaccinated general viruses, society, need stop catering don‚Äôt want vaccinated.

Covid, whole, pretty deadly. old people, crazy deadly. children basically insignificant.

I know people said this, workout qualification, start everything; wrong, *for children* covid, factually, less deadly flu.

Two years ago nobody problem kids running around without everyone wearing masks, felt risk insignificant.

The risk covid less risk flu. always honor system. 

I last year seen employee person confront someone without mask. amazing overnight turnaround sub. Science king mean squat LOL. Young kids don‚Äôt need anyway. sure much countries test, charge.

In Denmark testing free volume high ( 5-600.000 persons / day aka 8-10%) insanely well since start, vaccine roll needs sped though, still nam needs held level praise NZ Singapore gotten. vietnam considered amber country travel eyes uk, reason Singapore green? maybe stupidity help us end time.... lol jackass wear mask ever protecting still isn't

This complicated. jackass wear mask universal mask mandate. claim they're vaccinated.  Childhood disagrees kids never Home Depot. spent seems like half younger years there. tell us save masks health care professionals. could told us wear home made cloth masks.

Did also go double masking recommendation two months ago?

They already said unmask vaccinated, that's really new. saying vacinated people ditch masks indoor settings, possible. I'm 100 percent sure result least unnecessary spread covid unvaccinated people go mask less infect least children, teenagers, adults fully vaccinated (which still people category getting vaccine) get lots people happy CDC. I'm thrilled mask enforcer work anymore get daily grief. 

But live state still restrictions, keep on. shopping somewhere still requires it, keep on. literally part new CDC guideline hurts one. 

Don't give workers grief enforcing rules store they've told enforce. point. point people followed CDC it‚Äôs guidelines year choose ignore new guidelines Doens‚Äôt follow narrative anymore. Anti vaxxers wrong. Pro mask forever also wrong. point. Masks work infecting others. get vaccine, kids don't. That's care. EVERYONE could get vaccine one's refuse, would probably care really don‚Äôt get it. Science science, viruses medicine practice political. vaccines made private medical companies, government...??? Whoever started conspiracy theory fool antivax/antimasker idiots wearing masks deserves metal!!! lifted everyone time get vaccine would summer. [What long term side Daniel Gonzalez goes research highlighting possible long term side effects mRNA vaccines. People simply asking masking continue required indoors every person able receive vaccine. That‚Äôs it. Nixon environmentalist. üò¨ population density factory farming late exceeded scenario evolution could prepared us for. 

I'm talking telling people CDC, I'm talking cultural shift people actually want seems like good idea, given well worked.

You know, like Demolition Man kind fluid exchange unheard of. Obviously that's caricature mean know. can't wait 3 sea shells too. Fuck toilet paper. Okay you. I'll go CDC says. Yeah, seems pretty wide spectrum beliefs among democrat politicians, republicans seem much lower tolerance disagreement within party. step line challenge party narrative, career gets torpedoed instantly. 

You democrat pro 2nd amendment, definitely can't republican strict gun controls. don‚Äôt think epidemiologists ever think ending mask mandates isn‚Äôt premature. They‚Äôre risk averse nature. Tuskegee representing exact opposite approach- government lying letting people go untreated instead. strange people would say easy wear mask complain selfish anti-maskers CDC makes announcement, longer easy wear mask couple months get much people *fully* vaccinated. think decision all? Agreed. conglomerate Walmart first domino fall, rest follow pretty quickly. yeah , spread unvacinated population. studies actually show data real world? masked countries done better maskless countries? masked vs unmasked states US? 


The Danish mask study showed statistically insignificant results.  ok reasonable person. ive friends stuff gone eat work retail also know stupid customers might still wear one work even mask mandate lifted. stated thursday late CDC announcement. projected full capacity restart NYS upcoming monday, I'm pretty convinced he's going wait he's got presser going it. They're probably, like states, taking time talk science people translate CDC recommendations local policy. Ending mandate would big deal politician going squander capital offhandedly. I'd surprised goes week without folding reopening plans. fuck cares. get vaccine. wear mask. avoid crowds. socially distance. Nobody making take mask off.  couple sexual assault allegations come hell lift mandate lol continue wear mask leave home. approved September. US, public private school, licensed daycare, summer camps, colleges universities. Tons shots boosters little kids (I 18 month old).

The 7 day ticked 18+ 7 day ticked down. likely means starting see decent 12-15 data come in! Kids much likely die flu covid.  3 thousandth time I've seen ""joke"". Shits old man haha someone's government role also think enforce guidance- particular, risk people lying vaccine status deleting last mitigation strategies altogether Even 95% efficacy, way hell catch Walmart unmasked. purely federal. CDC fine theory, 30% fully vaccinated, means every 7 10 adults would need still wear mask. really believe people beginning refused wear masks, want vaccine, suddenly hold honor code CDC wear mask to. kidding.  Really? 

I mean REAL??

NO SHIT?!?

WOW! THANK EARTH-SHATTERING TAKE, CNBC!!! Educate IMO.

[Using data published study Pfizer vaccine, Public Health England determined vaccine efficacy 89% 15-21 days dose 1 ‚Äì dose 2 day 21. range 52% 97%. days 15-28, first week second dose, protection first dose estimated 91%. range 74% 97%. second dose would expected confer immunity within nothing fear first shot. Keep masking two weeks second one. problem.

And people still gotten first shot ain't trying hard IMO. We‚Äôll rephrase you;

A guy know online, one hundreds thousands know general, got COVID says taste isn‚Äôt completely normal yet.

As comment originally states, risk low serious conditions young people. It‚Äôs easy cherry pick situations make big scary situation it, people FULLY vaccinated, risk essentially nil. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vaccines havw development since SARS outbreak China. Let's act like brand new Logical necessarily equate happens real world. Also, actually sneezes people? even measured? 


As far I've seen, Danish mask study biggest covid mask study show statistically insignificant results.  


Also, medical community even able prove surgical masks anything either decades.  


The biggest possible benefit masking lowering initial viral load (resulting less severe infection) there's studies obviously kinda unethical purposefully infect people. Again, that's logical translate real-world results? know. 


Also, places people mainly getting infected, people hours home work, much mask going help there? Let's say got first shot waiting get second. heard first shot might protect 80% infection. lack social distancing masks, infected person standing 2 ft away mask 10 minutes, getting infected real possibility depending kind mask have. properly worn N95, probably fine, less that, real risk getting infected.  things masks appropriate bars, restaurants etc also need shut seems me, logic remaining masked. Ok make good points affects business. still sucks kids though. really hope 6-11 year olds approved soon also get lives.  Well aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated still need mask. scientifically driven. disagree science doesn‚Äôt mean science wrong. 

Trust science. government callously disregarded human life past, would assume again, would assume motivations would necessarily racial every instance?

You're kind flinging doors wide open here. Yup, that‚Äôs also stated reference provided. right, can't. individual people decide want vaccines.

A piece cloth shit preventing spread COVID anyway. wearing least KN95, deluding yourself. Asymptomatic transmission basically exist, whole rationale masks first place.

At point, half population least 1 shot 1/3 fully vaccinated, asymptomatic surface transmission non-issues, virus high survival rate get-go, need concerned.

Children always risk level fully vaccinated adult. least vulnerable population, fantastic.

It's time go back normal. We're going fine. favorite cafe enforces it. got problem reminding folks they‚Äôve denied service couple people think wearing mask protected class. also provide ton free disposable ones entrance there‚Äôs really excuse. 

I‚Äôm ready done things establishment cool wearing one, great. still require one, it. cannot comprehend people try make life hell cashiers, baristas, customer service jobs. everyone wearing masks schools shut down. believe somehow magically kids going remain protected infection get rid protocols heavily limiting interaction? mention probably get us herd immunity levels quickest(by antivax people getting natural immunity), ideal situation everyone. Lots... pediatrician middle class thing, especially child longer toddler. pull 99.96% from? lol. determine ""we can't prove works 100%""? limitless data showing works. get chance destroying car? limitless data safety profile it. 

do typically pull things ass make point? mean me, known risk logical choice. know vaccine. still learning covid-19. see recent study erectile dysfunction? we're still learning. fun ED too, btw.  &amp;#x200B;

Florida fits Mumbai room spare.

biggest US cities = medium sized ***villages*** China India.

&amp;#x200B;

and Hindus get together religious shit..  
they go big.

real bad idea last 2013, Indian government authorities, co-operation seva volunteers, monks Indian companies, set 11 sectors 55 camp clusters, providing round-the-clock first aid, ambulance, pharmacy, sector cleaning, sanitation, food water distribution (setting 550 kilometers pipelines operated 42 pumps), cooking fuel, services.  100%!! Crazy quickly conversation went "" cant wait things go back normal stop wearing mask"" "" dont care cdc says still wearing mask"" lmao Americans think they'll rich someday, day inevitably comes decades backbreaking labor mandatory unpaid overtime, want grubby gubmint hard earned money. 287 dead despite masks school closures? would flu deaths look like level public health One pediatric flu death 2020.  Double masks work well N95. Oh give break ""one shot good enough"" BS. Give everyone fair chance protected. people's bodies take longer produce antibodies; different. 

I read TONS cases covid first second shot (even second shot). Check /r/covid19positive see mean.  Could least explain why? Haha, would welcome right now. fun balancing risks benefits. Vaccine seems least harm compared risking Covid one extreme, stunted social skills end. People rushing vaccinations new CDC rec?? 


Anecdotally yes, hard data clear week could lift mask mandate NYC... 


He could many people travel city live outside city. expect expect they'll wait &amp; see vaccination rate sees boost. expect short delay stays flat probably Friday. posted story day experts literally gushing great vaccines Here‚Äôs silver lining Michigan‚Äôs recent COVID-19 surge: became America‚Äôs test bunny nation‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccines perform surge propelled B.1.1.7. And, fact, vaccines held very, well, Michigan health experts ‚ÄúExceedingly well,‚Äù said Linda Vail, head Ingham County Health ‚ÄúReally remarkable,‚Äù said Ryan Malosh, University Michigan ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible feat vaccines work well do,‚Äù said Josh Petrie, another U-M Experts cite numerous examples vaccines‚Äô really know gets better that. Yeah tell India. know see what's going India think vaccine scarier virus plenty time get vaccine concerned reason continue wear one.

Wrong. got vaccinated -very first- day eligible, I'm still fully vaccinated yet. takes 6 weeks vaccines, everyone much time yet. parent six year old feel this. Wifey fully vaccinated ready get back normal life, obviously can‚Äôt yet. do. MRNA vaccines studied decades.   death worst outcome obvious data point. Yeah, tell India. mean going details find flaws peer review about. always encourage questioning. 

The problem method. James thinks he‚Äôs expert anything googled also confident lack deeper understanding that‚Äôs American way also fuck not? 

But even bigger problem James thinks he‚Äôs infallible. told ‚Äòerror‚Äô pointed isn‚Äôt error all, accuses cover conspiracy not. Today 15th. April 15th 'over' month ago. exactly month. takes 5-6 weeks vaccinations fully complete date first shot.  lot value lost focusing deaths. Covid causes prolonged fully understood organ damage. even kid survives, may permanent lung damage.

Secondly, 277 kids died Covid-19 kids kept home far anyone could infect them. out, everyone else supposed wear masks. put safety requirements around flu, there'd far fewer pediatric flu deaths.

Oh wait, did. 1. 1 pediatric flu death 2020. exactly longer identify republican, also identifying democrat ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. republican family likes give hard time derogatorily calls democrat. dislike parties equally think ever mask mandates begin with? 

It's ENOUGH wear mask others around potentially covid **don't** wear masks. mask protects others protects people access N95 masks + eye protection. 

With new rule lots unvaccinated, anti vaxx people going walk around maskless now, putting others risk (including got vaccine fully protected). purposeful. I‚Äôm interested explaining liberty important, apparent. I‚Äôm expressing distaste opinion. 99.75% hospitalized COVID patients last 3-4 months unvaccinated. want run around town unvaccinated unprotected point, end hospital wonder you‚Äôre sick, you‚Äôre taking risk point. 

For kids aren‚Äôt eligible yet-yes sucks-but keep masks get shots soon them. Legitimately know thing. guess low hanging fruit. thought something. You‚Äôre going ask doctor one. Although though AZ still really high protection real illness, maybe less testing positive? Send Latin America. We'll gladly taking them. interesting research! shown mechanism thing possible vitro. thing confirming happens real world, shows possibility. Cool stuff! kids? Literally child 15 fully vaccinated yet. Why? seems pretty logical. I‚Äôm getting vaccine ASAP despise masks. mean shit that‚Äôs got done right away. Agree. new mask mandate seems bit reckless premature. depends entirely honor system good faith, least 40% US population lacks. adding multiple people steps process otherwise showing pharmacy. Every obstacle stop some. Washington still +2000 per day. high last year. We've issued 6.5M doses 7.5M people WA.

And CDC said vaccinated people wear masks anymore. moronic.

Can't wait one month see infected cases per day go down? fucking urgency remove masks?

Vaccination action. Reduced cases result. Measure result, action. Come man. like management 101.

Measure fucking result. Ummmm.... FUCK NO!  risk COVID19 children seems exceedingly low.  totally understand. youngest 11 oldest 12. nerve wracking heart wrenching. I'm still going girls wear theirs' peace mind sanity.  I've following science along. Partial protection -- especially since 10 days shot.

And again, good people country -- people *want* get vaccinated -- still waiting get first shot. health reasons logistics. empathy compassion them?

Nobody asking ""permanently"" change lifestyle. keep wearing mask another month two Americans actually want get vaccinated chance get fully vaxxed. 

But moot now. congrats -- spared torture mask weeks. us fully protected get play Covid Roulette every time go shopping. 3 million population Houston, TX, perspective. Yeah.. üôÑ point trying make! Nobody cares people sudden everyone cool someone getting one shot yesterday apparantley means fully protected. blaming people getting shot right became eligible waiting May even though circus time. Asymptomatic transmission thing anymore.

Says who???

Give reputable source that, there's reason stopped. 1 death flu among children last year, compared hundreds covid. true covid less risk children flu. seems allowing everyone assess risk. want built around assessment. matter? youre vacced youre fine, even indoors people covid

Hell dont even quarentine hanging inside people covid, unmasked, unvaccinated unless develop symptoms, rare.  tell vaccinated üôÑüôÑüôÑ welcome   going like IVs infusions medications end hospitalized.... source: RN Shrug, know tell you. second hand reports family US showed need id birth certificates. Maybe NYC large undocumented population changes things ?  want end, unlike people avoiding vaccine. Get vaccinated, people. Especially want thing end. 15 months pandemic people acting like death bad outcome covid ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  many ignorant selfish touch people country unvaccinated/antivax wearing masks get close people.

I mean, already were. Nothing really changed guidance. personal choice though you. Covid isn‚Äôt never disease like Polio, respiratory virus insanely transmissible threatened completely overwhelm healthcare system kill large percentage elderly vulnerable.

It‚Äôs 16 months now, vaccine available everyone 12 available vulnerable many months vast majority already taken opportunity receive shot(s).

At point don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking child Starbucks retailer unvaccinated people may lie vaccine status taking well within rights.

I don‚Äôt see though translates hundreds millions people vaccinated continue live shell life protect groups either negligible terms numbers simply risk looked population level people need little bit time get used changes. We‚Äôve known long time covid affects elderly. Even children come covid, aren‚Äôt likely become seriously ill. continue concern, need lot sick children summer. better happen rather quickly. People move fast. Absolutely agree. tons single parents low income families can't afford delivery childcare take kids them.  they're 12, sure!

If they're not, risk anything mild symptoms covid insanely small worth concerning with. Well, early tests pretty high false negative rate, so....  Yeah I‚Äôm you, downside someone else picking stuff you, also upside yeah Thats - we've studies months get vaccinated, really dont need mask. CDC *has* slowly rolling point finially announcing read studies still wear masks inside reason.

It comforting though hospitalization death rate fully vaccinated practically zero. Hopefully anti-vaxxers mostly hurting themselves. say work, said still chance could get pass on, albeit small. still effective protecting showing symptoms needing hospitalized, even end getting covid. 

I stopped wearing masks outside since vaccinated. I'm even one people, understand would continue wear masks. really complicated, makes feel safer. Science Politics = Good
Politics Science = Bad, bad Holy Sh.. review CDC guidelines, decided I‚Äôm done masks

According CDC guidelines, still wear masks federal buildings, public transit, medical buildings! won't. Asymptomatic transmission thing anymore. see sick person, steer clear.  believe important figure pandemic started, saying otherwise (that ""literally matter"") feel possibility explored, ""the public"" can't handle it? makes sense me, thank responding. also think completely wrong. unfortunately common.

The notion ""public"" can't handle information officials &amp; media saying COVID ""just flu"" February 2020. trust public hear truth -- COVID potential cause huge problems -- thought public would freak out.

Same logic masking. People like Fauci said masks work, even going far say may harm people wear incorrectly. admitted later on, say believed it. said b/c worried people would freak cause shortage masks healthcare workers. trust public enough share reasoning. backfired.

I think best lay facts table, caveats uncertainties. people misunderstand distort message purposes? sure. alternative worse. Lying, quite reasonable, causes mistrust. need trust public health science deal COVID whatever else coming us future. theyre even months late science, studies done ago announced lift restrictions vaccinated people ahead time vs. immediately. Sure push people act faster also expose people unnecessary risk. Nope. vaccine 95% effective, 100%. care get vaccine you‚Äôre already vaccinated?

Because know people can‚Äôt take vaccines medical reasons. care strangers, even they‚Äôre making mistakes.

Because empathy‚Ä¶.

Why care unvaccinated? want think I‚Äôm antimasker let them. complied dutifully happily year. deserve free now. I'll wearing mask WalMart even COVID due nasty lmao Terrible logic. Half country hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccinated, nationwide mask mandates lifted? predictably lead disaster.

It signals pandemic over, one needs wear masks masks work.

In fact, 37% people fully vaccinated, 53% people completely unvaccinated.

And there's large amount infected people, vaccinated may save you. vaccine 95% effective, 100%. 2,024 deaths per million.  CDC Faucci said vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread virus. vaccinated person wearing mask going around, aren‚Äôt posing risk aren‚Äôt vaccinated including children.

So understand concern parent may have, fully vaccinated person guilt following CDC‚Äôs guidance I‚Äôm too, it‚Äôs gonna happen. Either it‚Äôs unconstitutional congress inept (and executive orders bite them) it‚Äôs gonna happen. 100% within right serve someone wearing mask, like shirt, shoes, etc. Yeah, that's kind point. know who's vaccinated know are. Caring people working serve matter consideration. I'm mask forever guy. I'm fully vaccinated walk streets hang vaccinated friends masks. somebody working serve dealing assholes day, inconvenience wear mask around kindness care. lot comments contrary fairly classist inconsiderate Lots folks still - lots folks can't. spread virus. Vaccine 100% efficacy people catching vaccinated. new variants virus likely come unvaccinated people. primary concern folks getting folks sick. not. California showed positivity rate 1.1% last week meaning unlikely come contact someone covid. Combine high prevention rate vaccines there's extremely low chance actually contract covid assuming vaccinated. CDC literally sets structure rules set. rando scientist says mask forever mean they're entitled paid attention to. idiot scientists said masks cause breathing problems technically scientists too, listened too? course not.

No one saying unvaccinated people maskless, we're saying unvaccinated person really concern me, who's vaccinated. I'm protected, aren't.

And ""brain rot"" mean every thread filled locking people homes Wuhan style, I'm kinda glad sub moved past idiocy phase.

The reality masks coming off, distancing going away, may bit fast (I would preferred hit 50% fully vaccinated least) going ease back normal life US here. require proof vaccination. wore masks mandated it. would transition two young unvaccinated kids. New York must following different science CDC. Man almost makes want get COVID get cool glowy drink...

Interesting talk vaccine passport either. France made it: million first doses hit today! Thats dont get, could give first doses almost every adult right now, reduce mortality spread, worry second doses olympics That‚Äôs said lol, made seem like people crying wear mask go Starbucks lol.

Prior Covid major hobby mine BJJ/MMA. It‚Äôs basically wrestling, obviously wasn‚Äôt something gonna Covid.

I‚Äôm young healthy, past 15 months forced leave university friends, miss last year school graduation, taken away multiple work opportunities countless things.

So yes, new normal shell life. CDC guidelines step return normal chain like Starbucks embracing guidance also following direction. fully vaccinated person according CDC spread virus, returning normal life beginning today.

I'm already vaccinated though. always window. one know seriously thought would hit 70% vaccinated anywhere isn‚Äôt California. national scale, we‚Äôll peak around 67%. Tops. 

That 70% likely lowest allowable vaccination rate still stop pandemic, it‚Äôs gonna protective vulnerable community anyway. won‚Äôt even reach that. Tying mask mandates vaccination rates would result everyone wear masks forever. get things done, rule iron fist. care get vaccine you‚Äôre already vaccinated? I‚Äôm vaccinated couldn‚Äôt care less. That's amazingly true Research it. Scientific papers don‚Äôt agree assessment reality. Honestly, anything cuomo says ignored. dude textbook narcissist doesn‚Äôt care anything outside nyc. Question: high risk ""high risk"" kids?

My general impression kids quite safe coronavirus -- certainly flu. Given extremely low overall fatality rates across kids, assumption particularly dangerous even conditions may put slightly higher risk. said, can't say really know data, I'm sure literature this.

(Question inspired [this lots parents expressed worries kids new guidelines). Damn, thought hoped could build GPU chips! Several states tying easing mask mandates percentage population vaccinated. That‚Äôs window now. Same. It‚Äôs unfair employees may kids home may medical condition makes vaccine less effective. people mentioned, masks work best protect others rather protect wearer. big fuck staff. 1 3 people full vaccinated still.   chance isn‚Äôt negligible. That‚Äôs 94% prevention works. Nope. Sero-test anti-N antibodies trivially. Vaccinated people antibodies S, natural infection, you‚Äôll carry anti-N. That‚Äôs J&amp;J tested breakthrough infections. state can't fill appointment spots available, anti vaxxers state. point forced mandatory vaccinations except medical conditions immunocompromised needs go effect. Public health takes priority. No. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated won‚Äôt. they‚Äôre vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt care either. wear 95s version of. protect me. It‚Äôs like threw vaccines trash hung banner saying MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. still vaccinating people. added 12-15 year old age group. Kids younger probably eligible fall. still progressing. Yeah people know people idiots assholes can‚Äôt trusted mask aren‚Äôt vaccinated. course people get vaccinated still wear mask bc not? stuff I'm seeing twitter bananas....people putting unmasked people blast without know vaccination status all....I saw post pharmacist grocery store unmasked people trashing one pharmacy without one....despite overwhelming likelihood fully vaccinated..... yeah, feeling then. *clearly* wearing masks. I'm furthest thing science denier can't help continue skeptical decisions. Right here, yes follow recommendations. hilariously wrong. California 3 million Covid cases 3 confirmed reinfections. Two days ago California announced they've 3620 breakthrough cases amongst fully vaccinated people, 150 hospitalized, 20 died far.

The vaccines good saved tens thousands country far, possibly hundreds thousands breaking transmission chains, really silly suggest natural immunity luckily surviving Covid inferior vaccines. real world data suggest otherwise. even arguable point. people dragged people dragged literally two entirely exclusive populations. Says Microsoft funded research study... There‚Äôs lot people still counting free ride herd immunity. fact they‚Äôll fine thanks 70% get vaccinated reinforce belief never anything worry first place. think it‚Äôs productive know goals thresholds are. People need know they‚Äôre working toward survival mental health businesses need know (tentatively) plan. week week, high level, far nebulous public large, even may work you. 

I mean, long people go Dr. Fauci others saying ‚Äújust little longer,‚Äù lose faith entire enterprise say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù entirely?

In sum: caution drawbacks too. CDC‚Äôs decision based data think it‚Äôs sound (all admitting could become headache states businesses).  Cosplayer here, won‚Äôt going Con restrictions lifted, includes masks. point going not. huge part life.  mind sounds really fucked up, know Obviously. Especially people evidence back things up. say things say it. Keywords fully vaccinated. staff customers store likely fully vaccinated poses risk them. Thus, non-mask wearer fully vaccinated that's fine. true Day two hope side effects. nausea subsided thank goodness. Still running slight temperature on.

Good news I'm functioning today. Yesterday whole lot nope tried anything lay bed. 

2 weeks go shot number 2. I'm ready over. literally argued use masks, saying vaccinated people forced live shell life them.

I asked wearing mask means living shell life.

How exactly straw man? sounds perfect me. Personal choice, it‚Äôs vaccinated individuals have. lot living missed past 15 months I‚Äôm ready get back starting today. ...they can't afford Walmarts free curbside pickup? huge deal face symbolic little bit irritating. wear prefer to. there's factual reason won't. grain salt wise, SCMP less biased mainland networks. masks never come off, anyone signed for.

For me, kids access. can't get vaccine yet best somewhat cautious, said I'm around fully vaccinated people intend wear one. Well yes, lot unknowns virus that's inevitable. gave best possible advice given known time. time moves on, things know approach truth. can't freeze organs (to specific, can, thaw cells get damaged de-freezing process). Current cooling technology allow us keep livers viable couple Absolutely makes sense wear one especially since work kids much. It‚Äôs going weird in-between transition while, think everyone comfortable changes hope patient other! employees vaccinated too. I‚Äôd wear mask employees.  means ADA require let unmasked people store. Thank you.

They must provide service even curb. real world ones bearing extra cost anymore. masks part standard, within rights, ADA thing say it.


If can't wear mask medical conditon right deny service. must make reasonable accomodation whether that's curbside collection entry. 




We'll see Friday mask filled future seems unlikely given corporations coming saying much. That‚Äôs pretty much many US shopping spaces. thought may whoever‚Äôs high risk category US ample opportunity get vaccinated, though may ‚Äúpush‚Äù fence sitters. say can‚Äôt understand danger viruses. Imagine instead viruses mental disorder throwing deadly knives random directions, frequently, fact chance hit 1 1000 days. Would discriminate hire them? science saying basically catch fully vaccinated. certainly won‚Äôt catch share it. thanks. almost every job I‚Äôve working home possible, office purely form control/policing making sure you‚Äôre working daring use free time anything might enjoy. Plus commute, clothing, etc.

Pass. want force dumbasses don‚Äôt pull weight office, great. Let earn privilege working home, otherwise leave us be, especially us spent big money pocket make working home better/more feasible. Even that's case, vaccinated protected. exceptional circumstances risk worth people, most, immune really need worry. protection 100%, close 100% could ever hope for. people‚Äôs entire identities formed past 16 months became contest see could take virus Seriously (TM) could live restrictive life. 

I‚Äôm honestly worried many people don‚Äôt see statement CDC good news - we‚Äôve vaccinated many people come far start heading back toward normal life. really makes nervous people going try fight choosing wear mask situations I‚Äôm allowed to. Straw man symptoms first second dose? people can't get vaccinated they're immunocompromised. mention children immunocompromised too. COVID-19 clinical update #62, Daniel Griffin covers outdoor transmission virus, safe use NSAIDS, expansion Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine include 12-15 year olds, post-disease Mucormycosis, hydroxychloroquine treatment associated increased mortality. people say things like confidently? Even ""I heard..."" would make post bad, without even horrible. Remember one rioter capitol got 360 no-scoped Twitter users starting calling ‚ÄúRoberta Paulson‚Äù actual name came Actually can, people answer. HIPAA applies someone essentially going behind back asking doctor personal information. ask you. say yes no. friendly reminder, gov pharma thought thalidomide would A-OK people use, know happened there. No, odd. I'm concerned medical condition. I'm wearing mask I'm outside, completely alone, wearing mask taking walk difficult medical condition. people approach me, walk away create extra distance‚Äîthis quite normal social behavior pandemic. guy intentionally close space us saw trying keep distance, start talking clearly wanted left alone. covered mouth extra cautious, comfort. told stupid stranger wanted left alone felt like verbal harassment. Barking opinion stranger medical risk exactly polite small talk, especially idea person's medical history. You‚Äôre arguing like I‚Äôm fear monger. Read recent comments. I‚Äôve arguing vaccinated people favor continued masking reason. went today without mask on. great. 

Do small children? do. problem asking continue wear mask public follow CDC guidelines long place. I‚Äôll take advice Center Disease Control guy Reddit. Kids already used wearing masks. little downside asking continue vaccines approved kids age CDC indicates safe stop masking unvaccinated children. way trust people. I'm vaccinated continue wear mask. love identify loud proud Huh. Anecdotally, I‚Äôm trans woman HRT worked retail since thing started, never caught covid. even roommates caught covid quarantine them. Tested negative antibodies everything. Always wondered able pull I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt go public maskless. vaccinated lot things, maskless, public. It‚Äôs I‚Äôm worried making wrong choices. 

I saying CDC, making statement soon, inviting lot risk abuse. guarantee lot places going drop mask requirements social distancing, without vaccine card checks, non vaccinated people going abuse loosened restrictions. could easily lead increase cases again, keeps whole thing going higher volume. put us risk. 

Anyway. could wrong, hope concern unwarranted, knowing people behaving country past 14 months, could see biting us ass. Right best worlds- vaccine reasonable mask protocols many places. Take away mask protocols better hope vaccines enough protect us long term. We‚Äôre already seeing data countries vaccination US cases going opened much soon. don‚Äôt want see happen here. Vaccines free easily available. people chose take risks getting covid, that‚Äôs them. India doesn‚Äôt vaccines available way US does. Clearly massively ignorant. apologies. asking kids there‚Äôs research (not kids) stating 1 3 COVID patients. Wrong, vaccines fine variants. LET DOUBT IT! Superpower  done believing science what‚Äôs goin thoughts exactly, zero problems vaccinated people walking around mask. assholes going invariably lie status cause trouble. hopefully morons present grocery store 6am though. sorry, maybe i‚Äôm misunderstanding you. saying think Vermont NY mask *bans*? Florida, 1 child 5 died Covid, 6 kids age 15. (And course includes time vaccines infection rates many, many times higher.) data found, approximately 60 kids die car accidents annually state. unmasked child many, many times safer store car. really. see lot people color instance won‚Äôt get vaccinated due distrust within communities taken advantage past medical experiments. described literally every medicine, turn turn ONE thing. medicines capable TERRIBLE side effects even though one thing.  give shit, illegal. You‚Äôre still better COVID vaxx actual COVID.  Vaccinations give us degree herd immunity absent protocols  rate exposure increases protections decrease. rate remains constant situation remains same. increase number exposures disease, increase number people get sick. odds particular person getting sick per infected person interact may (viral load issues aside), many incidents interaction. Congratulations California, keep up! final vaccination rate 67% range enough get control though? continue circulate unvaccinated pool mutate goes? Florida! would illegal!!! (I‚Äôm actually vaccinated btw), mask mandates must end vaccinated people, it‚Äôs fair!!!! Nanobots. Thanks MacGyver! agree fear go far, come far this, thought small children lowest food chain vaccine, people can't trusted ""honor system"", could danger stressful. opportunity would see neighbors wearing masks situation wearing mask?

We cannot protect people themselves. someone refuses believe vaccines, fully responsible consequences suffer. Period. 

I'm fully vaxxed, can't transmit contract covid now. thankful sensible science-based change mask policy CDC. cant force people vaccinated can't wear masks forever protect bunch covidiots refuse protect others getting vaccinated. Yep, it‚Äôs something keep eye info comes out. Bad cases covid children still rare, risk complications thus far even lower.

Some observations: note effects mostly transient long term impacts still unknown. first mRNA vaccines ever approved FDA disease. Sounds right believe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening nearly every country United States. US fear hatred face coverings perplexing anyone views outside. seema like ""trust science , trust experts crowd"" really doesnt like experts say things disagree dopmer pathetic narrative.

Also camt help laugh. Leftist shits mock right people say ""ThInK ChIlDReN,"" same.  No. Walmart, sell degrees now. it‚Äôs CDC apparently disagree with, shouldn‚Äôt asking went college? Yes. Happily. based honor system. would bother, no-one even going ask they're vaccinated?  know non republican organization blasting Ads republican states. That‚Äôs reading article, push agenda ages vaccinated. would it? Many scientists say natural immunity far far better. Surely best idea would vaccinate virus try stick old vulnerable. showing proof vaccination privacy concern? fucking strap inject them!! Long term effects obesity well documented yet parents (in UK least) continue let children massively overweight. exacerbates impact Covid massive mental health implications (speaking experience Former Fat Kid).

Yes, Covid awful acting like it‚Äôs biggest current threat public health disingenuous dangerous. insane. vaccines demonstrated safe every population given them. clearly said COVID.  quite them, I'm sorry, recall ones hand. Vermont New York two know sure. think issue presenting proof vaccination never really gold standard way US begin with. Everything always based signatures paper. little cards get COVID shots certainly built last &amp; even acceptable proof, everyone feel comfortable revealing legal name &amp; DOB every new person meet prove vaccinated. Plus, card gets damaged lost? We're stuck trusting people's word out. suppose part American way. Full normality probably return society reaches point (sooner think - I'm putting money midpoint 2021). They're citing rates hospitalization. rate remains constant matter restrictions.  trust one. Ok, yea, someone explain second shot phone suddenly charges hold plugged in? Asking friend. Ever considered respect others may know fully vaccinated huff puff around them? carry around big ""I've vaccinated badge"" neck?

Empathy. Try least once. Hell drug.  reason push herd immunity even congregate theater, sports venue, enough people vaccinated prevents virus spreading. Think density problem drops color large pool one notices minute, glass see stays.

The hope would keep masks hit herd immunity protect cannot truly get vaccine.

Unfortunately we're arguing morons believe 5s Facebook search equivalent 12 years grad school. become political issue amount information change mind. fianc√©e fully vaccinated, still keep masks handy happily pop pass people wearing masks. still wear mine behind bar work, we‚Äôre still going wear grocery store etc. It‚Äôs simple act shows solidarity. hope people see way.

Whatever makes em feel better he‚Äôs service getting tho lol  child sized n95 respirators thing? health reasons? people contraindicated mRNA vaccines polyethylene glycol [PEG] allergy, it‚Äôs suggested use compare two, though, need compare covid risk ""normal year."" direct comparison flu vs. covid, mitigation place. child vaccinated discontinue masking them? Interesting sure. one reasons try remind assess new risk highly compared old risk. Neurological complications viruses scary, doesn‚Äôt suggest larger danger COVID influenza. fact, significant portion children severe influenza suffer neurological complications one kind another. Two things relevant me:
1) kids recover
2) fine risk flu, it‚Äôs clear orientation toward different COVID. We‚Äôve observing long enough confident kinds consequences rare (though it‚Äôs hard exact far). So, small number kids catch serious consequences, terrible, (for me) reason continue abstaining risks took readily pre-COVID. understand could come different conclusion, think would likely based cautious attitude toward new
risks compared old ones, rather difference risks themselves. Honestly, it‚Äôs worth listen anything real proof.

Though watch funds research. Cigarettes deemed healthy data tampered fingers pot experience. want freedom vaccine gives me, want employees seeing jerk anti-masker. Trust science guess. comes 5th wave, everybody wave!  Well yeah one got flu year everyone locked inside masked/distanced. normal year much better representation flu risk would expect mix responses.

Deaths primary concern here. increasingly clear COVID medium long-term impacts health adults children contract it. parent, responsible expose child virus could diminish ability breathe focus, increases risk cardiovascular troubles road? 

In contrast, vaccine shown short medium term negative effects anything like scale see COVID population received it. 

If given choice vaccinate kid (even without child testing) expose COVID, I'd chose first option without hesitation. unhappy forced either accept second option, keep kid isolated world.  That's somewhat interesting, lot read seemed showing study argues lot asymptomatic case is, redefines lot presymptomatic cases.

It's worth pointing study sample size 50, well. That's abysmally small making sweeping statements from, find another source I'd love see too.  wife talked 4 months shy. keep home months get vaccinated.

Cause never job dress code grooming standards.... well... yea... suppose must something get hyped over. True. agree you. 

But hedging bets virus keeping mutations conserved. 

If doesn‚Äôt, see new strain that‚Äôs totally immune current vaccines, what? People listen next time? People‚Äôs response insane, it‚Äôs like think know experts they‚Äôve worshipping past year.

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt know unvaccinated people lie vaccinated??!?‚Äù

ah yes. agency thousands experts grappling disease, society‚Äôs response it, year thought through. you, Reddit commenter, cracked code. one else thought you.  definitely say necessary wear masks.... said even crowded situations still wear regardless vaccine.... FFS people read actual suggestions.   mention cases could end long haul chronic symptoms. ya like care. Ugh people ridiculous. long fully vaccinated give shit anyone else.  That's advanced subterfuge. would never thought that. multi billion dollar companies sure miss many undocumented migrants tend leave back home relatives. harder deport one can't prove country from. detain one find documents home country. However detention space limited &amp; immigration tends release can't expel quickly. 


The main exception high risk society. It‚Äôs wild gotta show proof get ur bonus answer question ‚Äútruthfully‚Äù work without mask.. maybe read wrong that‚Äôs interpreted  Good. Smart move. Since excess deaths coming far many counties been. estimated real figure probably double official figures.

Crazy 21st century like pandemics future historians able best guess actual death toll. here's thought.. maybe, maybe, people dont want vaccine also fine opening everything back up. almost like people ok self-agency? think point could unvaccinated people say they're vaccinated wear mask even still wears mask, he's put risk he's store them.

I think valid concern. much I'd like see mask mandates go away seem like it'd good idea wait another week two still stage lot people wanted vaccine fully vaccinated yet. Sure, many poor families can‚Äôt don‚Äôt go doctor there‚Äôs emergency. emergency, don‚Äôt go pediatrician. go clinic urgent care. still need AZ 2nd doses, no? million first AZ dose already.  Yeah, he's nuts looks like he's trying go permanent masks. What's wrong guy? Listen CDC dude except another item plate... active pandemic 35k new cases day still 600 people dying day. Please take flippant attitude somewhere else. It‚Äôs kinda funny, someone used browse ‚Äúcertain subreddit‚Äù similar sounds there, reverse I‚Äôm telling don‚Äôt know anything risks I‚Äôve put kid at. clearly aren‚Äôt reading listening. Go get mad people actually aren‚Äôt taking care kids instead people trying evidence based conversation best way sister 11 bday july. parents vaccinated waiting lol 100mg aspirine every day  Technically counts medical history. Even though personally willing tell anyone everyone I'm vaccinated, many people (I'm talking anti-vaxxers) see gateway privacy violations. There's also question handle cannot get vaccinated. Nah thats it. Im worried going Legend situation Even car seats, numbers higher covid... That's point seemed making. $10'000 per person fully vaccinated. Even 10K would cost far less going another year flare-ups, rolling lockdowns, deaths. Going 2019 population figures, would cost $3.28tn. far financial cost pandemic likely well excess figure. last stimulus alone $1.9tn factoring costs. Crazy world live in. indiana, children covered state poor. that's went doctor entire childhood. case states? Super intelligent considering told still wear mask crowded situation ok.... mate say like republicans want open country up. youre literally saying they've saying. lack awareness comment real. believe possibly released purpose, believe conspiracy theory. 

I'm confused. believe probability SARS-CoV-2 virus deliberately released non-zero. mean ""believe conspiracy theory""? Covid-19 survived without vaccine. However, believe therapeutics. FDA slowing approval drugs work? politically motive? Check video two Well, hope it‚Äôs good spouse got JJ! Generally it‚Äôs second shot gets ya Pfizer (if all) . J one shot system won‚Äôt primed reaction unless you‚Äôve previously Covid

I symptoms effectively treated Advil honestly felt good like know it‚Äôs working Well, I'm sure that's true. think missing going dinner movie means live shell life I'd say perhaps need hobby friends. job requires person work half time, I've coming 2-3x week throughout pandemic. Early pandemic tried stagger schedules people came number people building given time half sake social distancing got dropped while. People basically schedule come needed work.

The company maintained steady sales pandemic think there's pressing business need change things back full time office either. Though surprised see things become bit structured still allowing part time working home.

 expect new CDC guidelines change much. Masks still required offices state, regardless vaccination.  wasn‚Äôt talking anti-vaxxers interested taking advantage honor system. talking people don‚Äôt want get Covid aren‚Äôt necessarily opposed vaccine, dragging feet making appointment actually get it. incentive now, ‚ÄúWhat maskless people grocery store haven‚Äôt really vaccinated? could get sick. guess better look get vaccine.‚Äù Spoken like economist.

With tax one hand tax credit/deduction move universe. Well we‚Äôre still headed herd immunity.

Just depends people personally want help get us there: easy way (get vaccine) hard way (getting COVID) understand it. CDC says vaccinated people wear masks. guys see wearing mask know vaccinated. honor system? would probably be, around 2% Global Population Covid far. feels like chance negative reaction Vaccine significantly higher chance catching thing begin with, course he'd rather take it. minor inconvenience wearing mask store = living shell life? Seriously? Covid restrictions we've deal last 15 months, one always seemed like easiest me.

And yes, mean take kids anywhere indoors unmasked adults they're vaccinated (September earliest). unmanageable- generally prefer outdoor activities summer anyway- businesses patronize. 1. Business ask proof covid vaccination. That's protected.

2. hard pressed get legit medical proof indicate prevented wearing mask

3. serious underlying health problem, wearing mask harm &amp; vaccinated duty KICK accomodate illness &amp; put risk least make wait outside get stuff you.

4. ADA protections point accomodating would put others risk. everyone gotten shots required time therefore risk.

It fails 4 levels.  Here's couple extra tables.

No I‚Äôm suggesting this. I‚Äôm sure anybody would. Vaccinated people aren‚Äôt morally responsible health unvaccinated people vaccines available abundance time. Following science would lifting mandate entirely. Wow. I've never gotten statement like online. Quite honorable you.

I think lot people missing translation process takes place science actual policy. process super easy levels ""everyone wears mask"". new guideline totally understandable lag actual policy states determine obligations are.  Yep, good article. Fixing environment requires transitioning green economy, needs lots funding. funding paid somehow.

Not strictly true. Without trying advocate position still easily envision small government / pro capitalism yet ‚Äúgreen‚Äù platform. build around concepts like deep tax breaks green technologies carbon swap market polluting businesses zero footprint investing heavily carbon sinks like undeveloped forest land.

The unwillingness promote green economy less government spending (regulation instance is, relatively speaking $5 trillion budget, cheap, idea carbon cap trade market tax breaks cost nothing) protecting profitability certain highly specific industries or, cases, specific companies. [Trials already underway bet 1-5 next age group start summer.

I think gets lost comottion options suck. Lacking long term studies either, roll dice vaccines rather Covid. One killed 600 thousand Americans despite medical intervention, killed, what? 1? 2?

I honestly get people trouble processing odds.... groups‚Äù every opportunity get vaccinated. they‚Äôre they‚Äôre free make choices double mask stay home. 

You'd surprised many elderly, poor, POC, single parents, rural folks want access issues can't get time work/away kids, etc. private medical information private. Requiring people share strangers

Sure buddy like said, owned business refused answer refuse mask up, ass street   huge change several months ago, pilot vaccination clinic shut two days launched due cut shipments. (January-February, think) hard believe we've made much progress. ‚ù§Ô∏è 4 places wont going another 6 months haha. Transmission organs issue there's also matter people die long illnesses often make good organ donors since types illnesses mess organs (although often parts body still donated). Organ donors often sudden unexpected deaths otherwise healthy people, like motor vehicle accidents. AFAIK, evidence masks pose danger whatsoever people asthma, COPD, respiratory conditions. 


Danger legal standard, never never was. standards reasonable accomodation, legal burden whether reasonable demand. CDC says masks required vaccinated, without state mandate lean longer reasonable. question becomes reasaonable require mask exempt medical grounds. 



Lawyers cost time &amp; money specialized ADA law cost more. cheaper, easier &amp; less tiresome shrug &amp; let challeneged. stupid, entitled people welcome claim ""I CAN'T WEAR MASK ASTHMA!"", businesses still tell wear mask get lost. law side.


Yeah that's ada works &amp; never been. 


Medical complaint: Wearing mask causes panic attack.


Store: Ok reasonable accomodations offer...



Costco required cloth mask plastic face shield offered curbside delivery orders. acceptable accomodation, pandemic.



You convince mask service meets ADA standards. CDC says masks required vaccinated adults, state law says done. burden shifts business prove denial service accomodation reasonable. Beeler said best parent two young children (11 9) agree. ‚ÄúAs parent, feel best protect children may mean still keeping restrictions place go children,‚Äù Beeler said. ‚ÄúAll weighing risks benefits family.‚Äù

There population people unvaccinated. percentage people also happen anti-maskers (who wanting go inside businesses without wearing masks whole time). Now, new guidance, unmasked vaccinated people going mingle anti-maskers refuse vaccination. absence vaccination passports, potential everyone could unmasked inside. thing is, believe COVID real, believe going lead bunch infections among mingling unvaccinated people. result herd immunity way, government really wanted it?

I mean, I'm telling OP BSing edit.

It's fine saying acceptably low risk. Saying there's ""no risk"" another story. Flu mutates easily mentioned comment, particular genetic code, Covid's mutations orders magnitude slower that. Covid mutates likely uncontrolled spread countries like India see coming far enough away develop booster.

Also flu spends lot time mutating animals humans close proximity to, mostly birds lesser extent pigs. Covid seems infect ferrets bats easily I'm aware animals passes between. Covid like flu vaccinated population.

To unvaccinated Covid still potentially lethal disease. understand perspective. actually disagree, I‚Äôm community could totally wrong. perspective though, someone watching debate social media many prominent voices lab leak hypothesis, letter one monumental moments debate since began.

Why much drama thrown basic facts shared. 

These facts even CDC Dr. Fauci discussing. 

Why fearful facts open honest discussions? Life black white. always nuances. called mean someone fear mongering pushing people sort extreme. 

It's something keep mind. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm alone mask situation. don‚Äôt understand people ready listen CDC say fully vaxxed people like us good without masks. 

I‚Äôll respect everyone‚Äôs decision want wear masks, please show respect. Oh shit nice, sounds like need check key peele sketch. Thats totally I'm talking about. realize masks aren‚Äôt really preventing getting COVID either? They‚Äôre stop spread. sort device carried everyone sort of, don‚Äôt know, application, could provide sort proof registration upon request. devices could somehow relay information without wires. 

And idea long would go on. would need sort way quantify many people vaccinated compare many people are. would need sort department experts could look transmission hospitalizations could determine type thing would longer necessary. 

Completely impossible care public safety worry impacts they'll us harm they'll progress. wrong really matter time got sick anyway current rates community spread, means least keep somewhat contained social circles since insisting mask general public drove cases enough may spared many themselves. 

If I'm optimistic though, bunch getting sick might make time becomes necessary first boosters they'll learned enough hard way get line rest us. news, peanuts banned substance. K. hope planning compare different phase 3 trials 

Yeah would suck use data have. Fml Though may enough protect immunocompromised. point matter personal responsibility go unmasked stand right next people unvaccinated taken ass hands. Either people protect don't. 

Especially since several weeks open everyone get Fully-vaxxed middle-aged discount wine loving mom here, take back one-eyed robotic crustacean you! agree sentiment, fence sitter longest time boss told county‚Äôs health department shots available said vaccination time would paid.

People hope life get back normal vaccines.

Umm‚Ä¶ no, already data second dose. That‚Äôs already know stats it. guys didn‚Äôt buy enough kind, nation start studying one dose situation would look like. I'll friend mine 2 weeks great news! No, anything properly interpreting crappy science...

Those studies may discredited, information widely publicized. Well guess David Hogg going Costco anytime soon then. want people think Republican, now. Well gee thanks. Glad know family member cancer, two kids 12 rank. experts side eyeing CDC really hard too.

[There lot non-hesitant people marginalized communities positions life vaccinated yet want/plan be, isn‚Äôt simple Guess you‚Äôre wearing mask rest life then? Michigan Native here. wish people got vaccinated. Dude, copy paste comment many times like, change fact vaccine greatly reduce chance hospitalization case getting COVID. 

Your reasoning like, even vaccine 99% effective 100% thus completely useless? I‚Äôm sure understand. vaccinated not? hand wringing counterproductive goal, getting back normal asap. Fear anti-vaxers stupid. want wear mask get infected that's ruin return normal afraid assholes going take time people get comfortable. pandemic was/is traumatic event. degree agree. Im stating shouldnt trust vaccines data supports them. saying cannot ascertain degree confidence general local population may line general population. vaccine work great preventing infection immune system still overwhelmed causing breakthrough occur. immunologist peer explained, healtht individuals likely caused quite high viral load. isnt rocket science understand localities higher unvaccinated population liklier higher viral load, especially may use new CDC guidelines circumvent mask mandates unvaccinated. 

As many instances, first jump usually riskier delayed approach. couple weeks would confident approach change different manner adds new variable equation. Well us immunocompromised science shown vaccines super effective us yet. I'm worried antivaxxers wearing masks lying vaccinated. Easy say it‚Äôs kid. Plus, aren‚Äôt variants dangerous them?  pull back sometime even Fauci saying effectiveness vaccines steep decline daily cases makes time OK, know risk associated AZ vaccine related blood clots. Additionally, know (pretty incredible new vaccine) efficacy covid case, option manage risks degree. Getting big four vaccines (J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna, AZ) route back normal us.

1. **inform next kin** (parents, spouse, kids, boy/girlfriend etc.) AZ vaccine date x. Make sure know symptoms.
2. **monitor yourself** \- symptoms CVST fairly straightforward spot:

* Headache.
* Blurred vision.
* Fainting loss consciousness.
* Loss control movement part body.
* Seizures.
* Coma.

If (granted one might little tricky) apply vaccination, need get offensive. **Get touch health professional!** headache particular quite MHRA said ‚Äòas precautionary measure, anyone symptoms four days vaccination advised seek medical attention‚Äô.3 symptoms prompt concern new-onset severe persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion, seizures, shortness breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, unusual skin bruising pinpoint spots beyond injection **Do hesitate consult health professional consider risk** early treatment vital positive outcome.

In instance, positive right treatment, patients full recovery CVST, TTS would say option taking AZ vaccine 30, decide take it, almost certainly fine, but, like medication, wary side effects. Know are, inform and, **under circumstances, ignore red flags**. Additionally, again, make sure closest friends/partners know received it. Fixing type blood clot requires scans tailored treatment result hospital stay outcomes appear good.

If wait Pfitzner/Moderna (mRNA) option, blame risk averse bear mind whilst good thorough understanding AZ vaccine, hints covid infection may potential long term health issue 10-20% infected: best!  Statistically, children concern. child roughly 5 times likely die drowning 20 times likely die car accident covid. Basing policy decisions risks low make sense.

There practically reasons someone can't vaccinated, seriously immunocompromised concern everything - covid. again, making policy protect small group logical.

Vaccines work. Mask mandates longer necessary. Yes, millions Americans gotten vaccinated 0.007% breakthrough infections.

You still chance dying car accident even you‚Äôre wearing seatbelt, logic one driving. Again, know long term impact COVID.  far normal life, IMO ideally guidelines would written indicate fully vaccinated people would distance wear masks among vaccinated people. would still give people incentive get vaccine, importantly would given businesses wide ranging basis incentive reopen vaccinated. could live like normal vaccinated ALSO lower risk virus spread businesses would encouraged open 100% vaccinated folks. Sure go mask free distancing vaccinated now, there's vaccination requirement entry, there's potential higher risk exposed virus. 80-90% population vaccinated probably Covid like flu.

I thought talking real world here. 80-90% vaccinated (including babies) isn‚Äôt currently given lesser vaccinated % mask necessary. Vaccinated people still asymptomatic carriers virus end infecting non vaccinated people, situation get worse.

So denying science? Literally studies provoked new guidance states vaccinated individuals rarely get infected. do, SUPER RARELY spread virus.

Do think CDC would make move much doubt this? think you‚Äôre one knows ‚Äútruth‚Äù? You‚Äôre science denying/conspiracy theorizing COVID latest clusters Singapore started asymptomatic transfer virus vaccinated population.

This happened details outbreak need clarified. 28 airport workers infected, 19 vaccinated. None severe disease.

Hey, studies come showing vaccinated people likely known spread if, I‚Äôm taking another look we‚Äôre doing.  We‚Äôll find sure pretty soon here. Well I'm immunocompromised idk body making lot/if antobodies even though got fully vaccinated N95s [don't filter 95% *of COVID even mask taped face. Disabled people generally access something like professional fit tests, [people get nearly much seal (which includes non-professional fit tests hospitals doing).

Would make sense booster (made variants) 1 year later so. argument ""most cases asymptomatic therefore death/hospitalization rate bad currently suspect"" may turn true. case, yes ***may*** less dangerous ***young*** individual.

**BUT** here's BIG caveat that. COVID-19 overwhelmed hospital systems worldwide brought many brink collapse. Therefore, true actual death rate lower currently thought, fact still able send enough patients hospital nearly collapse health systems means infection rate also significantly higher, ultimately two factors balance danger covid remains severe currently thought. health system collapses can't treat patients world pain.

As Italy notice while, future research give us answer maybe variants gradually mutated 6 months become infectious deadly recognized threat. Maybe exact nature COVID spreads societal level allows kind difficulty early detection.

And also, evidence showing vaccines overwhelmingly stop spreading virus nations like UK able open people 40 offered jab. I‚Äôd hope responsible enough get vaccinated return second dose would also responsible enough continue wearing mask fully inoculated.

Sure can. want instead want angry strangers. make vaccinated people sick though. personal choices impact personal health stage now. fully vaccinated. five year months. *need* continue wearing mask public protect transmission me? went large event two weeks ago, fully vaccinated, event enforced zero safety precautions promised, I've wearing mask around son two weeks safe. Wait learn many people driving cars without insurance expired/no license.  People need understand breakthrough cases rare, realize odds transmission breakthrough astronomically lower.  Get vaccine effect able live life. Seriously don‚Äôt get people understand that. Maybe PTSD ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù it‚Äôs obvious vaccine works nothing worry about. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre finding reasons keep us pandemic. multiple friends issues minor cases. friend dealing brain fog her, previously controlled, ibs flaring (her doctor said linked covid) since got last year. case mild-- fever cough body aches.  Every day, compadre. Sometimes twice. Sometimes even more! Trusting science mean trust science. beginning, masks effective preventing wearer transmitting virus protecting wearer. good protecting. However, numbers might get small enough adequate supply N95 masks.

Flare-ups among unvaccinated leave open possibility new variants could potentially resistant existing vaccines. Additionally, eradicating virus herd immunity might mean vaccinations annual. So, extent, could possibly problem. feel safe taking 2 year old out, since she‚Äôs young get vaccine.  Wonder lol actually think every single person vaccinated anti vaxxer, think extremely unrealistic world view. polls indicate twenty thirty percent Americans want vaccinated, we've barely got majority eligible population vaccinated. There's massive chunk people bothering, even problem vaccines.

I understand difficult people understand that. lot people care much because, yesterday, getting vaccinated actually accomplish anything individuals. can't think direct clear way say this- Vaccine hesitant vaccine apathetic different groups people. move meant address apathetic seems addressing hesitant difficult less results. think pretty simple concept. get confusion. never science. opportunity attempt seem superior/smarter everyone.

As soon ""well group feel inferior _____, must opposite superior"" crap started, everyone stumbling jump bandwagon.

We life FAAARRRRR easy days. Ask election. Tl;dr: vaccines amazing. Running google translate, think nuance lost here. sounds like ‚Äúcriminal complaint‚Äù filed groups/individuals, ‚Äúcriminal charges‚Äù would think US.

Cannot find English language source. Walmart, Costco, Publix lifted well 1. Unquestionably happen, that‚Äôs get vaccinated

2. shots good it‚Äôs likely happen, 99.97% people hospitals right unvaccinated. dramatically reduce transmission basically 100% protect anything mild asymptomatic Covid.

3. Part CDC‚Äôs calculus lifting restrictions vaccinated provide incentive; there‚Äôs huge number people would respond there‚Äôs insignificant number people. Remember point get somewhere around herd immunity least high enough protective bubble expands even can‚Äôt get vaccinated whatever reason. also, everyone wants fully vaccinated yet. know two people first dose second, wait two weeks full effectiveness. 

i want anti-vaxxers walking around maskless everyone wants vaccine fully vaxxed. we're least month early that. responded last bit seemed little passive aggressive state's mask mandate lifted inherently affect private businesses line thinking use spur notions mRNA modifying genes. mean shocking really! I'm appalled!

\*rich people waving fingers\* problems looking for.

Nvm good back work Monday. No, I‚Äôm pissed ones medically can‚Äôt get vaccination like live basically told ‚Äòwear mask forever‚Äô, thanks anti-vax piece shit doesn‚Äôt give shit anyone themselves. would like know get life back along everyone else, seems like won‚Äôt happen places actively mandate vaccinations that‚Äôs probably going happen. haven‚Äôt restaurant, seen friends, done anything except sit home go work since last year still goddamn can‚Äôt we‚Äôre going fucking *honor system*.  Would type thing researchers mRNA mice? Using mRNA create specialized cas protein destroys viral RNA lungs allows viral replication. drug would delivered nebulizer. protease inhibitors different? I‚Äôm familiar subject unfortunately.  people gonna cry way went back Disneyland? Thanks boss! Boyfriend still working getting shot, really wanted know hang safely. Thank you. Trader Joe's keeping many pandemic policies place, wellness checks employees spacing people within stores, according company's statement. grocery chain request require proof vaccination customers, Trader Joe's spokesperson Kenya Friend-Daniel told CNN Business email. noted employees still wear masks time.

Their spokesperson confirmed it, little late walk back now. vaccinated.

You‚Äôre anti-science, thats problem. Typically, alright get vaccinated quarantine over. jurisdictions may ask wait longer, however, vaccines short supply country. 95% effective stopping something &lt;1% chance killing you...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   That‚Äôs happen. Let‚Äôs hope enough vaccinated prevent surges. don't, CDC's mission includes saving liars too.  one said anything others wearing them. question would vaccinated person wear one, explained mine are. don‚Äôt give fuck anyone else does. SIAP, besides RFK, others mentioned? response.

Nah, that's get immune system without vaccinated. matter. Japan close ally. real threats Iran China russia Per CDC guidelines, yes! Exceptions crowded public area (e.g. bus, plane, train) medical facility. Otherwise, yes! America wild place. Canada want 75% people vaccinated start reduce restrictions. honestly horrible nothing pretty much anywhere between. Hopefully you‚Äôll easy time it!

Tylenol helped arm pain pretty bad (felt like I‚Äôd hit fastball), time fever broke, arm pain much tolerable level. way harder time pneumonia vax booster, solid two weeks bad symptoms knot arm lasted six months (not typical reaction!) week‚Äôs shot annoying, really bad half expected. importantly, enough people protected hospitals safe overwhelmed surge. That's whole reason first place. Right guess question asked one friend vaccinated (and totally person choice believe) constantly bombarded friend group 
 
""A danger greater good society"" 
""Putting everyone else risk"" 
And every thing everyone probably heard. 

My question is: they're saying fully vaccinated people safe, say everyone? unvaccinated people truly big ""danger others?"" danger themselves? Give time. We're coming significant public health crisis time, worldwide pandemic. normal hold thing kept safe year.

India lost control pandemic there, thousands people dying every day. Yeah, capital infinite. course is. Wouldn‚Äôt agree there‚Äôs wealth society today 1800‚Äôs? capital wealth finite get billion dollar companies?

Yeah, doesn‚Äôt come nowhere. comes labor, innovation, technology. guarantee next 100 years we‚Äôll building cities, starting new businesses inventing new products generate wealth capital. 

You may say we‚Äôll eventually burn resources Earth universe close infinite get. Acme unionized believe A&amp;P thought. Except people compensated ‚Äúincredible responsibility‚Äù testify Congress bullshit happened responsibility, suddenly don‚Äôt know _anything_ happening company. mean would required outdoors first place? Brian Cashman given update, one symptomatic coach longer showing symptoms. tests prior tonight's game Baltimore negative. seems like complete end measures whatsoever still many people unvaccinated relatively high cases. Remove social distancing capacity limits sure, masking cost really rush get rid it. Gibraltar Israel still indoor masking rules. Usage may declined, still recommendation. 85% adults fully vaccinated well neglibligle case numbers. can't help seem US rushed one. incredibly frustrating could actually made Olympics grand affair. Ask athletes come month prior games vaccinate well. Instead that, havent even reached 2% local population. Mind boggling Less likely yea, like muuuuuuuch less likely based new studies. paranoid. Seriously. Everybody saying thing refusing acknowledge it. Kids risk dying Covid. That's Republican anti-masker bullshit nonsense. ACTUAL data. 

There's way things harm kids according statistics. [Most sample size two weeks bare bones, skeleton crew, week on/week off, since like last July everyone in. lie following mask mandates anyway. whole lot changing anti-maskers.

This true, though. I'm upstate NY; representative Republican. never see unmasked people stores. kind brother. 

He's lazy vaccine planning get it. runs business, 2 little kids super busy putting time go also perhaps downtime needed rebound. 

I think he's seeing error procrastination might go masked store others reciprocating double protection. think announcement came suddenly woke up. good news there's availability now. We've seen many state mandates store policies repealed since CDC made announcement could totally see feasible people literally completely done needing mask anywhere Memorial Day

My store chain currently 7/7 goal date completely tossing COVID related policy including masks vaccinated employees I'm hoping announcement makes CEO move didn‚Äôt care enough mask lie vaccinated.
I don‚Äôt want Covid even it‚Äôs mild case. Vaccinated masked don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm genuinely happy learn different. studies coming shows almost death rate, slightly higher infection rate almost sharing between. again, happy learn different. extremely low elderly mother confused heard ‚Äúmicrochips vaccine track you.‚Äù said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care track me. don‚Äôt want die respirator.‚Äù left like two weeks, really funny read article comments like lots people home year. No, people not. Yesterday‚Äôs - Tests: 1,394,977 - Cases: 37,544 - Deaths: 705 - Hospitalized: 29,404 - ICU: 6,316 (Tests/Cases/Deaths: +/- = change raw count day last week)
(Hosp/ICU: +/- = chg census yesterday)

Source: Let start saying expert, fact, far it, write thoughts go around brain maybe partially completely incorrect. 

With said, would imagine smart people make vaccines aware viruses mutate create ""variants"" thus best account assuming homework, risk variants fairly low.

Furthermore wonder concerned mutations viruses? COVID-19 specifically SARS-CoV-2 worry mutations escaping vaccine, viruses associated vaccines.

Polio vaccine came 50s talking parents none remember talk Polio mutating escaping Salk Vaccine. 

Again, maybe completely missing something, mind sees it.

Correct missing words sentence structure. Although vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective they‚Äôre still far effective 95% 75%.

www.livescience.com/amp/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html

‚ÄúOne common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%.‚Äù going vet gotten vaccinated not. going security door ""let see papers"" get in. wonder people like corporate America. No. won't. media created narrative terrifying variants. reflect reality. say without going anywhere, mean physically leave house 200 days? It‚Äôs difficult, really hope stay safe! also hope get better time. Thank taking part study!! idea going/when done? Mom RA uncertainty vaccine protection isn‚Äôt fun. heard antibodies one component, it‚Äôs possible vaccine still stimulates memory B cells even doesn‚Äôt produce many antibodies people. weather can‚Äôt accurately predicted either? source that? Still listen mask mandates reapplied time time expire.

I'm guessing states quietly let mandates expire next 8 weeks 4th bother reuping them.

What interesting cause lawsuits state try renew mask mandate now. get wait another month this. saw last summer numbers went dramatically. Give another month let people become fully vaccinated plus get natural benefit warmer weather/sunshine lower numbers almost nothing *then* tell everybody stop wearing masks. seems slightly eager way this. could lot better little patience. Go Toronto!!! I've read lot encouraging statements CDC, seen much areas non vaccinated, non masked people. know cdc states indoor without mask vaccine. I'm curious wording though, since think they're trying give incentive others get vaccinated wear mask. 

How low risk spreading covid I'm vaccinated around someone actually covid? anti-mask, anti-vax still remember CDC told us wear masks ü•¥ common misconception totally immune strains churned everyday. Read thread can‚Äôt continue insist vaccinated people wear masks forever science CDC says incredibly safe, 

I wish could say wrong can't not. 100% correct. problem un-vaccinated people going keep wearing masks. never wearing first place. Source please  CEO company said everyone back office next month remote work, period.

The union pissed, we'll see works out. people proud say it, they're called suddenly pretend true. really weird. Tedros disgrace know it. truly don‚Äôt know anyone defend point. makes less likely possible, depends strain vaccine. main problem non vaccinated obviously lie go maskless put daughter danger. that‚Äôs government haha employees get vaccine... that, CDC.

However, CDC declare US high enough threshold immunity low enough sustained caseload gone epidemic endemic country longer need mitigation making sure vaccines stay available get boosters going roll later year I'm boat mom. actually meds helping autoimmune issues (I MS) may cause vaccine effective (I'm study monitoring I'm making antibodies, shall see). happy everyone equal footing, fully vax'ed people go life (which also includes people flat lie), I'm actually gonna even cautious before. get though, people want live lives, expect strangers go way now. hope numbers continue drop. nothing, developing female sex characteristics low testosterone detrimental men. drugs negative side effects. Children 12 like 19% population one 12-15 fully vaccinated since it‚Äôs four weeks shots. support rule change think push people vaccinate, someone 3 kids 6 it‚Äôs scary.... Thankfully, we‚Äôre 14 months forced civil service giving lives save aunts Gertrude Edna... Monogamous societied like 2 company permanently work anywhere pick US time zone (for now) since almost clients Americas. want go office can, work home, anywhere else take laptop get internet access.

I can't believe lucky am. still wear mask indoors. studies show fully vaccinated prevent spreading changed guidelines. People say listen science ignore disagrees them. stsrt rest state follow NYC based regulations top needed. 3 months cuomo finally got smart made regional rules would forget update leave us (especially schools) limbo. Kansas masks, proved worked, changed nothing. Honor system lol, people get vaccines know need mask anymore. one keep seeing floated around: VAcCinaTeD peOpLe sTiLl sPrEaD It! people don‚Äôt want wear mask, cares. people don‚Äôt want leave house ever again, cares. let everyone get lives two cents.

that interesting dynamic though, agree talking covid-19 . vaccines.  triggering rare recurrence potentially serious blood clots people‚Äôs arms. downvote different view. misinformed effective vaccine is. vaccine guarantee get virus. guarantee can't spread it. 2 yr old lung issues. Wear mask indoors. question whole thing masks fully vaccinated....who exactly checking that? I'm vaccinated...I particularly care unvaccinated person doing.

I'm protected, aren't. consideration others. (Hence word ‚Äúhappily‚Äù) there‚Äôs *need* to. Outside making others comfortable around me. I‚Äôm nanny. keep seeing people talk ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know effects long covid children‚Äù assume that‚Äôs you‚Äôre talking about. fact matter don‚Äôt know sure possibilities exist, cannot possibly plan right now. long covid make magnet future asteroids? Maybe. Maybe not. Let‚Äôs assume proven otherwise. There‚Äôs way you‚Äôre vaccinated shut fake self righteousness. Children can‚Äôt get vaccine yet. large portion population shown care safety vulnerable people. end discussion. far herd immunity levels right now.  fuck lot friends health issues allow get vaccinated worried this. wish people would remember everyone perfectly healthy fine. Love going downvoting. Hard take disagreement? 

‚ÄúThis person different view, better downvote.‚Äù know office workers gone back. Sample size dozen different business. understand testing vax isn‚Äôt even good idea catching asymptomatic positives isn‚Äôt helpful. It‚Äôs unlikely contagiousb One thing I'm going miss captured sneezes. need definition. know words mean.

So agreeing imprecise language? saying think ""close enough""? Ideally, wearing mask compliance, consideration towards others. may fundamental disagreement issue Bias no, reading comprehension possibly. 

Happy learn otherwise. Seems like CDC probably knew people would lie safety studies continue come you‚Äôre vaccinated good shape. don‚Äôt understand group people. It‚Äôs like thing satisfy return normal COVID wiped face earth. That‚Äôs going happen. incredibly effective vaccines. It‚Äôs time move on. like wearing mask now. gotten sick year that's pretty cool actually. might ever stop wearing mask public. Odds variant beat vaccines, arise overseas us near term.

Antivaxxers suck, world dealing scarcity issues rather persuading foolish.

Antivaxxers damage collective interest poor decisions impact able get vaccine, like little children immunocompromised. you‚Äôll fine Twitter really houses lowest common denominators. Thankfully, twitter doesn‚Äôt represent accurate population real world. 

and someone‚Äôs vaccination status isn‚Äôt business strangers anyway  child‚Äôs doctor always best source info you, find CDC guidelines (I read depth.) ‚ÄúPeople moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma likely hospitalized COVID-19. Take steps protect must reading comprehension biased agenda parent child young get vaccine, care. am, do. 

(I realize sound like asshole insinuated care kids, people can't get vaccine. ) I‚Äôd like run math here. [The masks 70% effective protecting wearer Let‚Äôs suppose two mRNA vaccines ~95% effective infection (which what[Israeli data show think extrapolate similar efficacy Moderna product).

So I‚Äôm unmasked, risk *infection* exposure SARS-CoV-2 already ~95% reduced. add mask that, add additional 70% remaining 5% 3.5% 98.5% efficacy. 

But let‚Äôs remember actual infection isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs important here. What‚Äôs important getting sick hospitalized (or worse). that, efficacy 97.5% based Israeli data masks add less 2% additional protection.

So facts. 

Now, interpretation: costs masks. uncomfortable, make hard read facial expressions, they‚Äôre real problem Hard-of-Hearing Deaf communities, generate lot waste winds wilderness water. completely costless measure.

For *personally,* additional 1-2% decrease absolute risk isn‚Äôt worth costs. doesn‚Äôt even matter guy next vaccinated. incredibly high protection even COVID-19 coughs face.

Now *your* interpretation? Maybe. maybe you‚Äôre B-cell depleting therapy vaccines don‚Äôt work well you. Maybe you‚Äôre otherwise medically fragile medically fragile family member home. people, maybe might interpret data differently.

Nobody talking banning masks, you‚Äôre uncomfortable, wear mask. personally, local health guidance dispenses mandates, I‚Äôm going wear mask anymore. boat I'm in. could keep mandate another 2-3 weeks I'll set. friends asthma got vaccinated me, feel like I'm last one party. must provide service even curb. real world ones bearing extra cost anymore. 

Many grocery stores restaurants provided Curbside service years pandemic. There's reason stop after. 

And failing that, third-party services like Instacart DoorDash. can't wear mask medical conditon right deny service.

Sure. key ""if"". And, proven (not sure keen undermine argument, OK), nobody talking denying service here. denying entry store. 

 must make reasonable accomodation whether that's curbside collection entry. 

OK, problem solved. still require masks enter mask filled future

What even talking about? know effectively lifting masking groups. factored in. excluded unvaccinated slight benefit know lie. it'll make businesses appeal demand say require vaccines enter. think that‚Äôs exactly says. we‚Äôre side this, guess let reminder health never back burner. Healthy living ultimate advantage 1.- fully vaccinated essential things masking keeping distance.

2.- Stop trying make ""children wont safe they're vaxxed!"" happen, necessary them, would nice sure stop spread, necessary them.

The whole endgame vaccinate risk (mostly senior citizens), chance US fully vaccinated 2 months. four days spent 200 consecutive days without going anywhere! lockdown Germany really massive success story. Great news, virus 99.7% survival rate people.  remove restrictions exist around Covid right now, increase risk complications around Covid. 
And, corollary, every year masking social distancing, influenza risk wouldn‚Äôt likely higher year.  Nope downvotes quite amusing, given think stated obvious... Look many companies dropping mask mandates 24 hours last announcement.

Widespread use vaccine passport fantasy, nothing more. Probably travel, maybe large venues end 2020. Bars? Restaurants? Stores? Yeah good fucking luck getting use it. ya prettt sure none died covid either left one week discovered hate working home. addition person shed much less virus unvaccinated people well LOL. Chill, buddy. followed CDC advice guidelines every step way. believe data-based risk management, absolutely sound like zealot.

Again, back: never said shouldn‚Äôt you. said one reasonably expect absolute certainty, that‚Äôs impossible. chances getting seriously ill vax low it‚Äôs essentially nothing statistical noise. I‚Äôm sorry friend something happen, always outliers situation. That‚Äôs life.

Be well.  Yeah comment posted like 20 minutes ago saying unfortunately immunocompromised screwed covid need focus developing gene therapies cures types diseases instead fueling psychosis need indefinite mask wearing. could lift today 3 months people always say isn‚Äôt enough. Jobs reports greatest many businesses limiting services even closed due unfilled positions. Yeah fuck company. Harris Teeter area. Haven‚Äôt shopping won‚Äôt moving forward. quick turnaround. Good. well documented kids exceedingly low risk serious illness COVID-19. perspective, CDC estimates around 600 children died influenza 2017‚Äì18 season; 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu deaths reported. year, 700 children die drowning. end April, 277 died COVID-19.

You tell literally safer right children go Jam-packed full stadium literally event winter covid. Right don‚Äôt see end this.

If end involves COVID dropping ends earth within next months, end this. However, vaccinations decreasing, cases continue going incidence breakthrough infections also become even less likely already are.

Immunocompimised people families always live differently others, sad true.  Natural antibodies target entire virus. virus mutated, antibodies recognize less. 

The mRNA vaccines target one specific segment spike protein.

Think bombing moving car dumb bomb vs. laser guided munition. Yeah.... That's basically mask policy. see reform? lost credibility guess won‚Äôt going back Trader Joe‚Äôs ANOTHER YEAR. Dang! virus care say think. We're still daily case rate equal last September, everybody agreed pandemic still much ongoing. best could say America decided *act though* pandemic over. actually going remain background threat long time. everyone. affect lungs all. believe ineligible shot still 40% pop refusing get shot. moderna :P Kids literally lowest risk getting severe Covid. equal risk flu common virus them. 

The whole point mandates protect vulnerable groups keep hospitals overwhelmed. issues taken care vaccine. isn't, he's far stupid necessary. What's ""tiny""? pretty sure ends bloodstream cells generated it, actually bothered looking much. saying make blood? gatekeeper though? guess restrictions could come back it‚Äôs going really really tough get people comply it‚Äôs lifted. I‚Äôm completely giving cdc much credit assuming someone way smarter math figured get sick we‚Äôre good go üò£ Keyboard warrior here: fit arm. Fight me. /s think likely situation gotten bad people started taking measures protect themselves. Vaccination rates still low, still single digits terms %. Masks distancing probably bulk work right now. expect Kroger follow suit soon totally get that, ""show zee papers"" something anyone wants hear. Context though, asked hospital I'd say sure, airport, sure, school, sure. suppose makes difference someone take personally. No, another state government following guidance best experts country.

Edit: wrong word, autocorrect. I'm surprised article even says measles one diseases spread aerosols. read *The Hot Zone* decades ago, though I've since learned outbreak Reston exaggerated book, fact worried Reston ebolavirus spread monkey house via aerosols ventilation. 30 years ago! [quick 

Really well-written engaging article, I'm baffled scientists discussion aerosol transmission antagonistic. common sense lay people reading book, top orgs world open this. Bro, relax subset immunocompromised people, especially transplant late stage cancer patients may immune reaction. people immune suppression drugs conditions  Well stranger comment sent dark internet rabbit hole, apparently proposed mechanism least virus RNA embed DNA: sure mRNA though. indeed outside US. always surprised empty US is. Even cities, nobody there.  I'm sorry hurt feelings, I'd quite literally die willingly chose republican. Also I'm 30. older get left go. Sorry old man.  end lots lots spike protein body

You end spike protein surface tiny percentage arm muscle cells immune system nukes body gets rid waste materials rapidly degrade. mechanism shedding proteins tiny amount protein would harmless. I'm frontline worker grocery store, fully vaxxed perfectly fine this. gotten vaccine point willfully avoiding it, case feel bad catch Covid. vax, nothing worry about. what's big deal? feel sorry us? issue US moment real incentive get it. Yes, lottery Ohio small bribes, talking serious things (risk fired able travel e.g.). Definitely better nothing, states like Vermont already reasonable timelines took matters consideration. changing course due CDC announcement. Around least, anyone would lie vaccinated avoid mask already wearing mask. Stores totally given enforcing corporate edicts Montana... less that.

Only 36% fully vaccinated. 47% least one dose. regions better others worse. almost forgot supposed Olympic Tokyo summer. That's stupid. young students lower risk. Right. Looks like sub flooded bunch anti maskers belong Facebook.

The question logical. 100 non vaccinated people go establishment without mask everyone‚Äôs risk! establishment ensure everyone who‚Äôs unmasked vaccinated?
So vaccination police too? need wait data absolutely sure safe. 

The people fall sick end crying ‚Äò‚Ä¶.but cdc said could go without masks.‚Äô
Selective listening finest. yup. ""but kids?"" argument COVID nearly dangerous even spread much kids. argument sort makes sense immunocompromised one. hard can't stay closed forever small fraction folks. Additionally, growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 others.

Follow link see studies.

Transmission aside, I‚Äôve seen lot parents decide continue wearing mask public model good behavior children. Except US allowed 12 15yr olds get vaccinated, vaccination rate go up. Probably rest lives, rates super low. Hopefully trend downward continues. participate everything everyone else masked, surround vaccinated people shunning unvaccinated.

I disagree regarding last bit I'd okay heart damage, touch lunch.  comes place fear distrust. much distrust government Americans, it‚Äôs hard go one extreme overnight. It‚Äôs going take time people feel comfortable again. 

And I‚Äôm talking ‚Äúsides‚Äù. Republicans Democrats different fears distrust, struggling. Personally, I've followed every piece guidance given CDC. I've socially distanced, I've worn mask, I've gotten vaccine. I'm continuing follow guidance.

Can't speak others, following science means following now, then. true cases. immunocompromised people vaccinated.

Most immunocompromised people successfully vaccinated become immune. exceptions usually transplant late stage cancer patients. reality check hits squarely face, get vaccinated.

Well better late never guess. tired hearing ‚Äúwhat they‚Äôre lying vaccine status?!?!‚Äù fuck cares. You‚Äôre vaccinated protects you, period. experience Trader Joe's top mandating masks customers throughout pandemic. get feeling. Honestly me, even like it. find masks comfortable plan keep using life sick well fashion :D sure many claimed US would return normal around 70% Americans vaccinated, roughly 47% one shot 36% fully vaccinated.

I guess we'll see happens two weeks, US hits 600,000 deaths weekend. see people getting vaccinated going anyway.

Believe already were. been. Either malicious-compliance-style masking (nose out, ""breathable"", fishnet, etc.) mask all. Take care. Sounds like rough time. vaccinated customers store without masks employees prove supervisors they've vaccinated able option well. Calgary researcher says doctors need keenly aware risks rare side effects linked AstraZeneca vaccine, happen anyone regardless age sex, case 63-year-old man admitted hospital blood clots described new case study published Canadian Medical Association Journal, patient admitted emergency department experiencing pain coldness left leg five days. received first dose AstraZeneca vaccine 20 days prior onset hospital showed low blood platelet count extensive blood clots leg Paul Petrasek, vascular surgeon associate professor University Calgary's Cumming School Medicine, says blood clots different parts body commonly seen cases vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) rare cases blood get blood clot one part body, two different parts body.

RemindMe! 1 year Unfortunately, due emergency nature studies, controlled studies like suggesting, apart initial ones placebo injections. reason withholding potentially life-saving vaccine people control would unethical basically require masks store anymore. We've gone willing, gotten access issues yet, lazy bribable. hope numbers keep going up. mortified why? people vaccinated guidelines‚Ä¶ mortified someone following rules? someone else following said rules cause embarrassment? incredibly low risk factors CDC determined threat significance. 287 people age 18 died covid United States throughout entire pandemic. That's 1/4 risk drowning 1/20th risk killed car wreck.   Nah, I'd cross side road/aisle/whatever. Cheers, friend thanks getting shot!

I advocating forced vaccinations. advocating society reason science respected, people willing make small sacrifices benefit fellow citizens. youre anti masker starts fight every Facebook post?! Cool! 
Stay safe anyway. guess there's good time test honor system reaching herd immunity, time less expected Covid prevalence cases already plummeting. agree. need herd immunity even considered! Correct  five year old extra vulnerable Covid complications? no.  assumption everyone cell phone (even sarcasm) account can't afford, want smart phone (Older folks, please tinfoil yet).

I get it, may staple you, part life-blood. Please assume everyone lives like you. Yes. bad news, mandates removed soon. Yeah it‚Äôs really meaningful. fun fact guess Immuno compromised, F U.

There evidence immuno compromised fully vaccinated. Thanks, Biden. forsee huge incentive, especially areas mask rules really enforced CDC guidance thing people bound It‚Äôs complicated though. unvaxxed people spread covid amongst themselves, mutates. likely eventually evade vaccines. affects everyone, again. target please next elitist response you.  Escpecially, herd immunity considered. ""real world data"" funny euphemism ""not randomized controlled trial"" Yeah Manhattan one place outside even really outside makes sense lol   Sure actually provides larger disincentive start unvaccinated since can‚Äôt depend masking rules protect now. Fence sitters need choose walking around indoors next antivax idiots probably covid getting vaccine. There‚Äôll portion population won‚Äôt get think fencesitters might actually rather get lol Sounds like great company work  7 8 symptoms. 1 mild symptoms. Vaccines work! What‚Äôs point getting vaccinated don‚Äôt want live free. vaccine protects serious illness ending hospital. 

I wouldn‚Äôt think twice entering place maskless others now. never ""prove"" information waiting for? Making antivaxers say vaccinated.   Let‚Äôs throw immuno compromised, daughter, wolves. Students already taking masks school.

The United States full crazy people. Thanks CDC.  Look I'm saying illegal it, I've never educated anything regarding medical law, know I've seen debate subject could easily imagine court case resulting kind debate. Maybe would come right, aces legal check person's vaccination records letting go grocery shopping- know that. know there's debate around it, could imagine Walmart attitude wanting test that. Simply ask customers make say vaccinated. Works wonders. Le recieved AZ vaccine: knew  saw study found TJs customers tend skew educated liberal, you‚Äôre probably right Sinovac private company, Chinese government blocking exports. That‚Äôs already started. far I‚Äôm concerned, *fine.* That's exactly concern get principle behind it. friends mad CDC guidance yesterday COVID lol lol, whole thing farce.  way check people actually vaccinated. point? might well say ""no masks required anymore"" going adopt children people died covid? chief executive Alexei Repik told ""Vaccine production takes around 1-1/2 months more, series,"" said. ""Then afterwards, compare output reference sample. matches, lucky. doesn't, pour product made.""

Compared that, Pfizer's QA seems like science-fiction. admit wearing mask 30% based public health 70% trolling redcaps.  I'm fully vaccinated - sure mind. 

Until then, I'll continue avoid indoor place without mask mandate. many anti-vaxxers around. Yeah it. 

Or accept kids almost guaranteed suffer worst effects covid. 

We don‚Äôt need mask kids kids far resilient covid anyone else vaccinated is. point literally slightly worse flu them. 

Do also suggest mask mandates flu? always going light switch. People restless going back normal either way, someone's feelings matter honestly matter much.

You near complete control sick get covid now. crazy that. choose get vaccine protected, choose to.  Anti-vax trash able breed sounds great me. didn‚Äôt expect Japan handle vaccinations poorly agree. I'm saying someone gets sick I'm afraid people immediately finger pointing. Who's afraid vaccine kills less 2% people get it? That's fine. go Costco. people want wear masks first place told skip locations, people scared others wearing mask told same.

If scared, get vaccinated. vaccinated, scared? spent last year told trust experts, comfortable comfortable now. Here‚Äôs take again. expected wear masks perpetually forever now? Yup doubtful willing lose business  Ironically, people vaccinated still plan masking don‚Äôt trust honor system vaccine end covering people lol. one wearing masks might start checking 20-25% still wearing masks? Sounds right, need check. said it‚Äôs okay keep well. say keep mass transit. isn‚Äôt clear cut safe vs safe issue like want be. Agreed.  Months waiting list. came bad press AZ suddenly called get shot next day, pick AZ. Sure, thanks fear mongerers. expect exactly zero antivaxers wearing masks change. **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

This going happen. honor system. lot people gonna honest, lot people be. larger either group number people vaccinated initiated vaccination. time start acknowledging successful effort policy return full normalcy. I'm very, pleased finally see it. call 116117? call find thing really helpful. non vaccinated didnt wear masks begin with. say this, absolutely can, climate announcement going spend day haggling customers vaccination records. Remember yesterday everyone piling shit basically saying hold let read through? Wearing mask easier keeping kids isolated. You‚Äôre one compared them. It‚Äôs probably least partially current mask mandates effective anyway. Bandannas thin cotton masks don‚Äôt much stop aerosols, covid spread. reason lot Europe tried move n95 for
Everyone earlier year. That‚Äôs way stop airborne disease. June 15, anyway. governor said mask mandate going away State ""fully reopened"" then, whatever actually means now.

It seems like one actually happy pretty good news. much COVID harshed vibe guess. news, Walmart still enforced pants mandate. know loves honor system most? Covid-19 especially contagious variants. 

This gamble incentivize vaccinatation go endemic phase. Choose side wisely. bet huge number immigrant nurses aids work shifts nursing homes. low-wage bottom rung jobs often staffed Filipino immigrants since speak English, yet willing work minimum wage. huge outbreaks nursing homes pubic health leaders failed accept covid spread asymptomatically. sound insensitive, hope, 96, nearly anything could take out. wonderful efficacy! 22m old won‚Äôt wear mask. He‚Äôs close. 3 year old will, sure feel comfortable indoors unvaccinated people him. 


TJs one places felt safe taking this. That‚Äôll change, that‚Äôs life. you‚Äôre outside normal human stuff never need wear mask.

Where Manhattan walk around yourself? live here, impossible sort social distancing sidewalks.  First Walmart Costco day. lot people predicted would local businesses waiving requirement first national brands wouldn‚Äôt later. timelines truncate quick. Decent behavior who? people don‚Äôt wear masks already? colleges require vaccines decide also require masking distancing, swear God.... Looking video reports tragedy there, it‚Äôs easy see people still bunching close together. saw vaccine lineups inside vaccine centres shown videos. people wearing masks, noses hanging wearing chin diapers. Yeah. honor among anti-vax. Mitigation never meant something lasted every single person vaccinated. fine.. Stop science denying cdc said it‚Äôs okay drop masks amazing news. Vaccines work, we're winning. Get vaccinated move life. though. It‚Äôs legally debatable, agree never this. Great - vax screening? anyone say are?   Absolutely nobody isn‚Äôt journalist politician seems want this, even areas variant. It‚Äôs definitely way pacify working class. parts England cases risen quite bit since March blue collar areas seem ‚Äúle Indian variant‚Äù. Good. Walmart led movement require masks workers customers, lets hope inspires many retainers follow suit. Vaccines won, time enjoy spoils victory.  Montgomery County deferring state guidance hits 50% fully vaccinated. currently like 46%. informed populace half get news facebook memes? vaccine hesitancy issue.

I'm gonna buy many tubs Coffee Bean Blast ice cream! matter anymore idiots do; everyone get vaccinated move lives. typing random sentences try disguise fact 

1) stupid fuck know vaccines work

2) stupid fuck thinks people covid permentantly immune.

You absolute fucking waste oxygen. knew would quick it. Glad stepping right thing! course count always going case antivaxxers always going antivaxxers. people need take necessary precautions illnesses diseases vulnerable to. Drunk drivers drug dealers affect everyone, children. that's hell strawman argument. 

The issue two-fold; risk children much lower risk adults, everyone kid. Therefore responsibility CHOOSE take additional precautions already fairly low risk profile. 

You want that, go nuts. everyone else's responsibility you. It‚Äôs selection bias. frail enough even get sick vaccinated, probably likely die too. liars knew would quick it. reported Saturday smallest daily increase coronavirus infections nearly three weeks, deaths stayed near 4,000-mark World Health Organisation warned second year pandemic could worse past 24 hours, India 326,098 new infections, taking tally 24.37 million, 3,890 deaths, toll 266,207, health ministry data shows. slow growth may also reflect test rates lowest since May 9.

It‚Äôs one done. 


No AZ vaccine 2 doses. whole point studies linked pander UK‚Äôs problem obtaining enough full doses mRNA based stuff. 


Well that's true, mRNA inherently better vaccine, also using AZ UK ahead USA terms doses administered per capita, look daily death rate per capita compared USA, clearly UK approach using available vaccines (which perfectly good, one better other) saves lives. What‚Äôs point touting per capita rate needles arms it‚Äôs it‚Äôs still fraction fraction amount doses USA able buy? 


The UK doses per capita ordered USA does, misinformed wonder UK vaccine rate becomes include it‚Äôs territories colonies? 


UK overseas territories crown dependencies receive doses per capita basis exactly position rest UK. 


This 1900s colonies anymore. happens spend year half angry strangers wearing mask. made sense then, people hard time thing upset others doing. It‚Äôs insane all. Cdc longer recommends everyone wear masks, mask mandate everyone longer makes sense. ‚úãüèª Apparently learned nothing pandemic? whole country stock full morons regardless skin color, race, religion, political affiliation, straight, gay, etc bunch fucking morons. 

And point longer give fuck. don‚Äôt want vaccinated fine.... get immunity hard way die trying. Oh well. simple influenza novel too. point Comparing 12 month period flu deaths COVID pandemic far arbitrary data finished flu persists year-over-year. 1000 kids died swine flu. worse COVID? Impossible tell yet. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Well good thing 80% protection week first shot. Also good thing choice wearing mask still feel like need extra protection. 

The point moving new phase **personal responsibility** new game, instead policing other's actions. **You** make sure get vaccinated, yet can't **you** take precautions. 

Wide-reaching public health guidance/restrictions require universal significant risk. We're quickly moving area risk less universal situational based personal circumstances, response personal situational. 


""...but personal situation requires caution"" - Great, cautious. expect entire world bend specific situation. You‚Äôre right, think can‚Äôt require take it.

But absolutely require tell gotten it, make stay masked don‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt think businesses require proof, point asking lie get sick you‚Äôre store, aren‚Äôt liable. already said, moronic behavior annoys me. time takes. time... also putting others gotten shot can't told old, young condition prevents pure selfishness. 


I understand logic would rather continue walking around risk catching covid unpleasant week lucky worse aren't. Rather spend 5 minutes get shot. Agreed...

A lot people suffered financial disruption, mental anguish could save geriatrics sniffles 99% population...

I never thought before, people like Cuomo face criminal charges suffering caused... Mask-wearing reduces risk catching virus too, figured like 8+ months ago. watched Contagion years ago, thought getting vaccinated pandemic would special moment people took masks celebration immunized. unvaccinated would respect celebrate turn get vaccine, people wouldn‚Äôt care mask everyone‚Äôs mask would protect themselves. Taking mask would liberation seeing everyone around threat infection anymore.
 
Obviously super naive. Contagion great job, doubt idea messed spectrum society would be. tried portray it, it‚Äôs nothing compared what‚Äôs going now. Yeah. don‚Äôt believe you. sounds like making shit try make point. Let spread Continue!  anyone actually checking vaccination cards, way stores put employees hell challenging hostile clients? Eh...until state (CA) reaches least 50-70% fully vaccinated, aint taking mask indoors stores. literally within inches unmasked dude sneezing past last week. fuckers getting vaccinated give shit ever. I'm really sorry go that. aunt transitioned care facility contracted succumbed Covid-19 early pandemic. 

A points wanted bring you. 

As far variants vaccines shown effective them. one pop vaccines effective against? Well, guess possibility number terrible things happening. weigh risk. know mean?

The efficacy rates different black white. tested different times, different places world, completely different circumstances. way actually compare numbers would given study.

I understand shaken experience we've through. got hug parents first time couple weeks ago. science shows vaccine likely protected. brother works them. addition hazard pay cut working worst days pandemic, tells store done temperature checks employees since last April (despite policy). busiest store Tri-state area (which lot). Agree.  Yeah US definitely help Taiwan vaccines‚Ä¶ got AZ small quantity, US many excess *sigh‚Äôs Europe* Gotcha, it‚Äôs crazy different whole thing depending live Thank raising concern. gave long response someone else topic below. Please read that. bad grocery store can't avoid going though, someone trouble unable get vaccine whatever reason. car friendly, there's couple areas Trader Joe's accessible grocery store. Wow. big rant without even reading trying say. 

1) absolutely believe vaccinated persons low risk infected disease called Covid-19. line lancet peer reviewed journals say

2) However, none papers conclude (and never conclude) person fully vaccinated cannot carry shredder virus known SARS-Cov-2. basically means vaccinated person might get infected surely serious disease, potentially still transmit virus mucus, saliva droplets. zero papers say vaccinated people SUPER RARELY transmit virus. Agree viral load less, know today transmission risk half one third one fourth vs non vaccinated person. 

Read study started would take months prove disprove transmission rates vaccinated vs unvaccinated population. 

3) Coming accusation science denying person. addition lack research transmission risk (with trials underway) CDC isn‚Äôt supreme god believe be. incorrect Coming 80-90% point. Given vaccination children currently, never meant include target population. does, &lt;17 group one highest adopters vaccine, line vaccines. hypothesis based fact influenza vaccination rate 6m-17 year range, ~60% ages 18-64 65% plus people aged 65 plus per OECD data. real world achieve figures sure. Agree 80% could stretch needed nature virus

4) One point would like bring forward outliers every society potential use guidance stop wearing mask even haven‚Äôt vaccinated. way trace public mall, road, party check every person wearing mask verify vaccinated. Don‚Äôt think huge risk, unless majority population vaccinated? Don‚Äôt forget called ‚ÄúCovid deniers‚Äù anti vaccine lobby would definitely part group. 

Lastly, accuse science even though didn‚Äôt deny findings scientific paper. happy take back statement paper proves transmission rate case vaccinated person almost zero negligible. paper exists today, please give apologise. also multiple extremely effective vaccines, risk population vaccinated part, better care Covid patients, less stressed medical system. We‚Äôre much better spot September, even daily case count high. Oh see Documentation? googled seen friend wear N95 face shield concerned. That's mean dealing though I'm talking cause scene store tell vaccinated card fake etc. vaccinated im worried another customer store might care them. 

I work retail see time customers social distance. I'm vaccinated care care guests coming store.  quick Google search? awesome! üòäüëèüëç you‚Äôre immunocompromised there‚Äôs nothing stopping wearing mask. Totally wrong. efficacy variants specifically cited CDC one reasons new guidance. checking bed covid? F‚Äôd  Ok fine. reasonable considerations endemics don‚Äôt go away. Also world record low equivalent going away? 

Of course flu would down. following protocol keep people spreading sickness. suggesting forever attempt get rid flu? Bc didn‚Äôt work lol silly thing bring that's choice, stupid is. family vaccinated moving life, back normal.

Edit: Happy cake day! Honestly getting sick last year *amazing*. get close masking regular, totally favor it, rest life. know I'll wear mask every time step outside, wish could keep going situations we're packed like sardines know sick. would still help people vaccinated wore masks prevent spread. people vaccinated may still wear mask asked started particular thread what's telling leave it. fuck wrong you?
I said problem ANYONE wearing mask vexed people think fully vaccinated people must continue accommodate irrational paranoia. something wrong thinking? overly insensitive paranoids? schedule meeting zoom discuss feel meeting discuss feelings this? concerned communicating constructively would enjoy exploring possible venues safely pursue improvement personal relationship skills endangering fragile psyches inhabit. something like pursue selfish personal agenda? give this---not able taste crap smell air public restroom HUGE benefit masks. think overly paranoid, especially depending live. There's always people hateful anyone chronic illness discernable reason. level naivety wishful thinking CDC absurd. easiest way get vaccinations level herd immunity would offer large (over $1,000) stimulus check reach necessary threshold. Yes indeed. win choice prizes. Massachusetts state New England yet end masks fully vaccinated. state rooted education science. Wild. link covers lot, thank you. So, really delving deep ifs here, I'm exposed carry virus without symptoms, develop symptoms one two weeks. think I'm understanding, risk still exists, less less likely.

So, want Peace Mind possible, still wear mask around people know vaccinated, get exposed someone unvaccinated wearing mask, wear mask around unvaccinated people two weeks ensure develop symptoms. keep using mask men's room work. people animals. Michigan worst hit state covid quite while. B117 variant running wild, grim.

Now vaccines kicking back hard! Michigan announced today...Whitmer lifts mask requirement fully vaccinated Michigan! CDC playing politics negative press heard? recently got first dose pfizer due positive press. test searches fragments virus.

Not active infection, fragments virus often remain even body beats SARS2 pulp.

If hundred virus particles breathed vaccinated person, immune system going pretty much immediately chop virus useless chunks. However chunks going match PCR test screens for, they‚Äôll test positive despite covid (they don‚Äôt illness, chunks virus), contagious.

To say vaccine isn‚Äôt effective situation like saying car wax isn‚Äôt effective beads water hood pour.

Having beads point wax. PA, announcement. Forgot states. Good you. Unfortunately you, fact something like 340 people age 17 died US due COVID means valid excuse keep restrictions place. really. Yankees 7 breakthrough infections fully vaccinated coaching staff. absence herd immunity, masks still matter. masks early , change tune trusted epidemiologists saying keep mask on. trust epidemiologists? hate Trump, hate Biden that's irrelevant. waiting proof life back normal take vaccine Exactly. think you‚Äôre seeing people worship science doesn‚Äôt suit irrationality. It‚Äôs pure emotion facts.

Like said, nobody looks data still worried kids would ever put car. Immunocompromised covid covid. cannot vaccinated due medical reasons. Rest world, whom, followed science responsibly shouldn‚Äôt restricting lives them. responsibility compromised take like covid takes even less time give shit people threat you...  It‚Äôs accurate: Showing 1hr ish closing works Costco sorts stores too. Sorry, thought similar efficacy rate kind vaccine like J&amp;J one shot. AZ still USA maybe also part miscommunication going here. real threats family climate change,nuclear war, starvation,disease. disagree science CDC? Luckily didint entire year people demonstrated would lie, cheat, steal rather right thing protect others. reason lose sleep report. One hope incident exactly author suggests, statistical anomaly. writer also says, high rate breakthrough cases would seem statistical anomaly. April 26, CDC reported 9,245 breakthrough cases 95 million people fully vaccinated, infinitesimal percentage. Yankees seen 13 percent traveling party, which, per New York Times, ‚Äúaround 60 people,‚Äù test positive.

This number 99.99% success, far beyond manufacturers vaccine claiming. also noted Torres, along 7 0f 8 Yankee employees, asymptomatic. thus reason condemn J &amp; J vaccine. job designed do. Well played CDC. antimaskers anti-antimask antivaxxers anti-antivax. Hopefully. Well played. Age gets reported supporting vaccine effectiveness feels like rewarding selfish irresponsible behavior. Nature thing tho. ‚Äúanti-CDC‚Äù ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù Jesus Christ. say someone fully vaccinated continue wearing mask safety others. It‚Äôs disagreeing ruling makes absolutely sense given entire trajectory pandemic. Wasn‚Äôt like, last week everyone freaking we‚Äôre never gonna reach herd immunity? Remember Fauci said expected us wearing masks 2022? incredibly sketchy ruling CDC seems buying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get people back work‚Äù ‚Äúlet‚Äôs keep people safe‚Äù Walmart did. expect see flurry announcements new days. Surprisingly, appear antivaxxer (not say he's reliable). yet friends continue freak obsess masks. can‚Äôt wait wearing masks wedding photos. wedding end June. That‚Äôs outdoors. they‚Äôre fully vaccinated. #FollowTheScience

Super frustrating! congratulations wedding day. hope it‚Äôs *normal* beautiful! ‚ô•Ô∏è big deal wear mask grocery shopping? vaccinated hold attend gatherings maskless, hang family friends, travel, go normal life. thing left wearing mask inside store short term given can't differentiate vaccinated vs. non vaccinated. 

Also, although vaccine protect vast majority people hospitalization death, case absolutely everyone. breakthrough cases people ended hospital even died even though fully vaccinated. rare though, impossible. experts feel need concerned that. would reasonable defer advice since unlikely qualifications make determination yourself.  No. Health Insurance Portability Pccountability Act sued liable spread disinformation? realize 1) impossible enforce mandate unvaccinated people 2) unvaccinated maskless potential threat people yet qualified receive vaccine 3) CDC recommends unvaccinated individuals wear masks.

The CDC recommendations solid science wise leave impossible enforce recommendations. way enforce unvaccinated people don‚Äôt put kids risk enforce mask mandate all. Good you! There's lot people consider freedom choice form oppression. clearly don‚Äôt understand HIPPO body miracle much give credit for. need take care it, ans take care need most. Congrats! science says transmission infection still risk unvaccinated people, one 12 yet receive vaccine. 

oh shit, better tell CDC, maybe could hire bet think got downvoted science experts disagree them.
 
When random person Reddit's opinion contradictory CDC, Biden administration practically every state government, going downvoted anti-science. This. I‚Äôm early 30s, sacrificing year life age incredibly terrible. Postponed wedding, didn‚Äôt see family long time, complied closures come back work. Im wasting best years life numb nuts think they‚Äôre smarter PHDs shit living dedicated lives it. They‚Äôre sympathy me. got second jab today. ü•≥  ain‚Äôt service dog physical disability. person says can‚Äôt come unless show zee papers can‚Äôt come in. do, much smaller degree, although that's intended purpose. people got vaccinated scheduled get vaccinated, insignificant amount, given average population eligible month ago... wearing mask anti vaxx maskless people run around really protect much. unvaccinated people really need continue wearing masks near term especially, happen. unfortunately innocent pro vaccine people going get infected waiting immunity kick waiting get vaccinated. Likewise! concerns unvaccinated people pretending vaccinated valid, knew someone vaccinated saw going without mask, would judge them? think people frequent sub think may come lab think manmade. think coronavirus gain function research leaked lab. biolabs still susceptible human error procedural complacency leads mistakes. think gain function research banned. potential benefits outweigh potential costs. going ""get ahead"" virus - mutations never predictable. ""actual question"" proposed action one would suggest it'd enforced. never said anything investigating. I'm also sure ever called something impossible, sure quote marks mean. we're past point ""interesting"" vaccines (in US) supply plentiful people forum gotten - broadly - we're waning day pandemic US. entire coronavirus subreddit going fade (and probably take international flavor) coming weeks/months. 

The topic thread killed thread (and, long run, subreddit). Walmart returns top boards one dirtiest places going. kids. Really wish we‚Äôd able get kids done first. Walmart became biggest pain ass store area last year, making wait get in, one way aisles, take cart even you‚Äôre getting one item, etc. didn‚Äôt go. Haven‚Äôt back. Don‚Äôt miss turns out. feel like it‚Äôs mixed message: vaccines work! still mask! Even though cdc said don‚Äôt to! It‚Äôs literally fodder people saying government won‚Äôt stop masking ever peek could significantly lower proactive response decline could come sooner. excuse failures fail-safe worked time. it‚Äôs elitist free time  polonium-210? except children chance get vaccinated

No, not. I'm tired hearing people got shots early. **Vaccines open across U.S. general population adults 16 April 19th.** Even able get first shot DAY, 19th, booked area, scheduled second dose next Monday (May 17), plus another two weeks kick in, putting me, tens millions people like me, fully vaccinated around May 31/June 1 **at absolute earliest**.

If CDC waited literally two weeks end May general population actually chance fully vaccinated, nobody would talking this.  Ok new India varieties? Don‚Äôt forget CA ""How lie Statistics"" Recommended Bill Gates. Nuff said.  neighborhood BK like one 5 people outside unmasked. neighborhood still super vigilant it. science long shown close proximity covid positive person least fifteen minutes really risk getting it. 

Passing someone street doesn‚Äôt meet that. curious think would work. 

You thousands customers go Walmart, example, everyday. logistics going look like checking every single person go shop?

What drive way store realize forgot proof vaccination, can‚Äôt shop now? masks, businesses would able provide mask forgot one. every single small business going check every customer walks store?

Also long would like go for? 

I‚Äôm trying start argument, curious line thinking. western countries unlikely accept Sputnik option. Nothing formally announced, considering political situation western countries Russia, unlikely recognized.

So far one introduced vaccine passport. talked EU Canada. mean people know weren‚Äôt wearing masks begin aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated either. That‚Äôs changing anything. CDC outright said vaccinated people go unmasked we're going see massive repeal masking policy mandates next 2-3 weeks.

Whether people want keep forcing vaccinated people mask forever like Kinda seems like need masks protect person wearing people around them, get whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs others‚Äô responsibility look health‚Äù thing dealt with. I‚Äôm collectivism needs within reason. people pandemic become identity. Costa Rica Again, completely wrong stop listening whatever news tells that. live pretty conservative area go stores everyone masked up. people walk bike around neighborhood wear masks, OUTSIDE, alone, nowhere near people. won‚Äôt long. Governments need create pro vaccine culture. Many countries currency cover Covid treatment public expense creating policies person decided get vaccinated ends Covid, pay treatment pocket. Measures like come place. might even see colleges organisations mandating employees get vaccinated. agree concept sovereignty putting others risk believe flat earth vaccines evil doesn‚Äôt mean enjoy rights citizen let go duties. listen guy because......... surprise absolutely one. cases/day globally  months  suggests 80% chance COVID 2.0 born.

That study assumes vaccine escape variant possible first place probability uniform per infection. Given gotten vaccine escape variant last year would seem contraindication! supported Murphy entire year said trust scientists. this. really makes sense all. think don‚Äôt *want* pandemic end. They‚Äôre getting kind gratification it. Whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery best rule follower,‚Äù ‚Äúexpert,‚Äù socially awkward introverts who‚Äôve enjoyed locked in, definitely people *enjoying this.* country Ya, he's dangerous beyond antivax. become HIPAA violation consequences refusing supply personal medical information? decade ago required submit proof meningitis vaccine online-only graduate degree, possible, suppose? Great news. get 2nd shot next week im &lt;60yo got AZ first shot, freely choose AZ Biontech. Ahh! explains confusion, thanks! wife fully vaccinated. We‚Äôre going party vaccinated friends tomorrow, we‚Äôve got trip Yellowstone booked memorial day weekend. 

It‚Äôs time things going ‚Äúlater‚Äù. Perhaps hyperbolic. Still, think least 15-20% hesitant die-hards might see signal pandemic skip vaccine. We'll see. mods sub insane delete kinds stuff doesn‚Äôt fit personal political beliefs kids. ""EVERYONE WANTS VACCINE GET ONE"" maybe repeat enough sleep night. It‚Äôs hopeless hardcore people. It‚Äôs people lazy wasn‚Äôt much threat anymore. need go unmasked stores probably work next legit loonies who‚Äôll probably covid pool weren‚Äôt really anti vaccine lazy there‚Äôs real incentive get issued mask mandate employees states did, customers always local ordinance follow. Canada pass U.S. 7 days. Sooner Although part tradition however would also like say economy kind goes numbers range 10‚Å∂ looking cars, iphones luxury items. Similarly 10‚Å∏ buying property. millionaire Indian currency like top portion middle class even consider entered entry level rich.

Like grand 1000 AKA 1K, Lakh (AKA Lac) becomes 100K crore becomes 10M. That's one bothered change it.  know people actually vaccinated not? things like SARS 1, suppose, officially listed eradicated detected years? asymptomatic? actually HIPPA violation. 

HIPPA requires medical professionals keep medical information private unless allow share it. case, Walmart employees medical professionals volunteering information, HIPPA issues.

That mean reasonable expect stores check vaccination status, course. Sweet

I wondering mask mine CDC statement since actually enforce mask policy. guess formally lifting answers question me. lol right*!!! I'm going WDW two weeks hope follow suit Right!? Oh shit! SLC6A20!? I'd better watch out! grandmammy told mutation there! would absolutely pay genes sequenced though could damn services scam. pandemic over. see cases/deaths crater summer, maybe less vaccinated states blip there, like many predicted, summer 2021 got upper hand it. fail see issue. I‚Äôm vaccinated don‚Äôt care shopper next is. concerned, wouldn‚Äôt bring kids store. Time get back individual risk calculations. Vaccines available anyone 12 up. It‚Äôs enough. needs widely distributed coverage actual data. Updated reflect millions doses already given. Bad news, real imagined, travels fast people simply stop looking anything refutes it.  committing shot, lot digging find answers fears.  Real, scientifically backed answers hard find. Archive without paywall: *interesting* say least. two viewpoints this: anti-restriction crowd see reaffirmation beliefs evil government behind lockdowns pro-restriction crowd see necessary evil means end pandemic didn‚Äôt enough information estimates conservative. 

It absolutely complex think sides use solidify beliefs ultimately end sowing division two groups. No. I‚Äôm going to. 7 day average NJ 420 4500 6 weeks ago. Blessed number U.K. high trust non-political state non-state medical scientific establishment though delegated substantial amount decision making them.

Politicians deferred publicly consistently medical scientific experts. People might trust Johnson (wise) trust NHS and, degree they‚Äôre aware them, MHRA, JCVI, SAGE. helps many people latter aren‚Äôt government employees free speak freely press. fact people dumb enough believe wildest shit repeating bs ad nauseam year literally zero evidence support outside ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù (and I‚Äôm putting politely personality allow) sources. 

You‚Äôre modern day equivalent 9/11 conspiracy theorists. mean can't get it? wear mask Walmart hit yes health screening fully vaccinated want $75 bonus gotta show proof vaccine card.. like actual fuck? Neither California, still go local Sprouts, Trader Joe‚Äôs, Costco without mask. Businesses longer want enforce mandates. Basically place required wear government buildings including public schools. click bait. ""It's complex, complicated, nuanced"" generate ad revenue. Us vs does.  awkward seeing racial themes promoted across political: 91% asians 61% black intend vaccine; mostly demcratic voters; still higher gop intent 56%.

I mean one party led someone saying covid would magically disappear without human intervention, focus thrown ethnic group, madness; - I‚Äôm New Jersey rarely see people wearing masks outdoors. It‚Äôs way past year. guarantee curbside pickup. major chain, pickup options. There's way accurately assess number asymptomatic annoying/mild cases among general vaccinated population. Unless job/school demands it, getting PCR tests. Yes, that's citing data phase 3 clinical trial. waiting longer term monitoring results (since phase 1/2 trails suggested immune response increasing 59 days injection) follow-on reporting efficacy wild. still pretty large confidence intervals around numbers EUA application. Like Yankees outbreak - good news/bad news anecdote particular vaccine. 8 breakthrough cases bad, 7 asymptomatic that's good. I'm curious particular vaccine faring wild compared vaccines. Well outside different inside, even small amount people. Yep, effect anticipating things get better near future mood booster compared impending doom uncertainty. like fog lifted head. New Yorker I‚Äôm tired guy. conversation breakfast. think it‚Äôs wrong ignore data disagrees preferences. 

The experts agree. likelihood taking vaccine increases relaxed guidelines follow. 

More half republicans aren‚Äôt going take vaccine mask, social distancing, lockdown guidelines don‚Äôt change. data clear. One weirdest things solution kids 12 vaccinated definition would require masks (if it‚Äôs enforced all).   Fully vaxxed here. I'm going stay completely inside next 4 months let everyone else enjoy summer/fall rush I'm studying LSAT. know can't get I'm going wait thing out.  don‚Äôt agree Murphy setting timeline ending restrictions metrics cause think that‚Äôs bullshit ending next month least. said CDC guideline specifically end masking/social distancing vaccinated people. remove mandates public without meaningful vaccine passport system you‚Äôre actually following advice CDC. CDC kind fucked messaging. commented thought ending mask mandates everyone signed messaging still leaves space governors say can‚Äôt end mask mandates yet. Every place fully opened next month two months cities. get #2 from? projection based something else? Except taking vaccine mean relaxed masking social distancing guidelines there's verification. people understand lie get effect getting shot, there's incentive.  People would take mask without vaccinated wearing mask begin with. No, cannot reach herd immunity virus able propagate mutate. continues, real potential future mutations render previous immunity vaccinated individuals basically useless. Additionally, perhaps immediate importance, removing masks way completely disregards health safety anyone cannot get vaccinated including health complications every individual age 12. guess misunderstood comment, apologies. brought USA sounded like meant non-residents countries allowed (which lot people America, think means ""non-white people"") start long last? Mine started 6 days first shot. 24 hours since nausea started. Food minimum staying down. I'm try electrolyte supplement. totally board accepting chills aches. nausea.... sorely disappointed lottery terribly excited shot number 2 2 weeks.  hope right. Even though PA following CDC's guidelines enforcing masks outdoors indoors, businesses still require masks Gov Wolf said mask mandate's place 70% adults fully vaccinated. We're almost one dose we're close half full, I'm hoping Memorial Day societal pressure make lift he'll say ""Go back normal, masks completely over"" since COVID restrictions supposed go away Memorial Day too. would make sense required 24/7, it‚Äôs not

Was Casemates 20 mins ago absolutely packed couple hundred people like 2 3 wearing masks 

Only time need wear mask get fine spot I‚Äôm shop time barely 5 people them, including cashier, make sense mom nurse recommends wearing another month thinks maskless unvaccinated people might cause mini-spike. telling do, course, middle option let canaries go first.

Yeah doctor saying state 33% fully vaccinated would smart continue wearing masks state least 50%-70% vaccinated. I'm going stick that. people developed countries think live bubbles stuff happens Asia Africa Latin America affect them. ask middle-age mom get vaccine, children doctor Rwanda, would choose children. Yeah I'm sure things like Tuskegee drive vaccine hesitancy community. Must stupid Um, going establish customers vaccinated? think self-reports likely reliable? 

Basically, saying require masks anymore anyone.

Terrific. - wanted add argument. disagreeing all. flu joke either. start school North Vancouver September awesome! :) maybe family member accompany see off!  Cdc said applies people fully vaccinated

Right New York follow science vaccinated people shouldn‚Äôt guidelines wear mask. still case adults. no, removing mask mandate yet public indoor areas.

The CDC didn‚Äôt forget amount people vaccinated made new guidelines. 

The CDC definitely took factors account. don‚Äôt know better do. disenfranchise then? can't trusted certain ideas, trusted vote? often begin threats violence unstable people Yes baby [Please ignore fact majority epidemiologists think CDC's decision extremely Because, y'know, saying scientists make call kind hurts point majority scientists favor continued mask wearing ;) they‚Äôre also taking children‚Äôs risk hands. they‚Äôve already proven, even said, don‚Äôt give two shits anyone own. hope come revaluate weird deification seem role CEO like original argument. CEO's role 30 times difficult require 30 times training generic role company? No. typically requires basically Masters-level degree often even that. requires different skill set jobs, ""better"" skill set. would still managerial workers skill set even pay limited two times average worker's pay. CEO paid 30+ times average worker's salary incentives going better job making ethical company, *strictly* profitable company expense ethics. whole idea great theory can't prove vaccinated meaning. personally wearing mask minimally year probably next. give two shits anybody thinks that. Weird. wish would said, ""YUP!"" never catch defending LeBron often either way. start May, CDC shifted monitoring reported breakthroughs result hospitalization death, Tom Clark, head vaccine evaluation unit CDC‚Äôs vaccine task force, said interview. ... CDC says numbers probably undercount, since surveillance system passive relies voluntary reporting state health departments may complete.

So words, official breakthrough numbers joke. starters, half covid infections asymptomatic, end hospitalization (and 1-2% end death). knows ""incomplete, passive voluntary reporting"" means. 

I find kinds admissions depressing. time CDC quite good. First shot pfizer one week ago today. Yesterday got hit mild fever, chills nausea bus. I'd concerned dehydration rate vomiting. May worth call doctor even one remote phone appointments least.  I'm nauseous vomit, though tried get relief. Fever also seems stopped. 24 hours since started. know different shot different timeline, sharing see much discussion nausea wanted put there.  Ah yes covid deniers haven‚Äôt making fake vaccine cards skirt around honor policies. even masks mandated state required businesses, didn‚Äôt employees confronting maskless fear assaulted shot repercussion. less people wear socially awkward be. still think people vast majority people saying year two. Additionally, vaccine approximately 77% effective preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring least 14 days vaccination 85% effective preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring least 28 days vaccination.

From FDA website. Hope helps.  hope never airplane.

If so, boy news you.  guidelines vaccinated people yes would mean believe kids 12 keep wearing masks they're vaccinated,   Covid March I‚Äôm currently waiting 2nd vaccine shot.

It's likely already incredibly potent immunity.

Some countries would make get second dose. Someone please something disgusting rapist start living life Molecules hundreds times smaller viruses unlike virus might already have, bogged moisture droplets exit mouth easily pass mask. guess advantage removing it. Social distancing businesses can't survive reduced capacity. masks really disadvantage associated them.

Look territories high vaccination rates, seems Spanish border likely reason keeping place now. Although Israel still government seem rushing get rid it. think said would update guidelines soon (for schools, work, camp, children etc.) trust health service though. Entirely different proposition. Brazil variant: Okay. That's fine. There's effectively nothing short actual authoritarian measures get people vaccinate wear masks. They're taking health hands point. mean mortality rate children almost zero community spread sharply Nah it‚Äôs gonna take couple weeks announce it. guess he‚Äôll announce end major restrictions late May/early June end sometime mid late June. That‚Äôs point. shouldn‚Äôt allowed people back in. 

If thought meant ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù, misunderstanding word context. understanding CDC knows people lie updated guidelines anyway.  wish guidance stop weeks instead immediately, I‚Äôm hoping California sticks June timeframe hinted updated CDC guidance.

Even two week waiting period would help incentivize unvaccinated try get first shot. going immediately unmasking vaccinated without way confirm vaccinations, least unvaccinated might incentivized get shot going unmask everyone else right away.  country worked centuries make Black folks feel part mainstem society, lot feel like they're periphery what's going Bingo! following science sudden frowned upon subreddit mystery me.

You mean wear piece clothe face exacerbates asthma ? asthma perfectly controlled long mask face, peak flows drop. uncommon issue us severe asthma. since comment suggests concern massive leaves room concern others let remind community


False continued wear one despite fact asthma nurse documented exacerbates asthma &amp; would legally exempt wearing one. followed rules &amp; guidelines despite legally exempted many . peer pressure felt right thing NHS say anti-maskers anti-vaxxers ""you're own"", then?

They wearing anyway nothing changed We. Are. A. Community. cannot write anti-maskers anti-vaxxers less become anchor. educate manage reach real end pandemic.


Good luck that, can't even get Texans agree whether chili beans, sure hell going convince knuckle dragging anti vaxers change ways. They'll get covid, gain immunity old fashioned way surive. consequences fundamentally fence sitters moving safety nets People cant work, goods services cant produced provided, resources drain, people working problem become exhausted, shelves go empty prices go up. vaccination protect that. 


Utter rubbish, occur virus decimating USA, Brazil, United Kingdom etc. sure hell happen half US form protection. 



The CDC says time drop masks fully vaccinated, argue CDC epidemiology ? I'll follow CDC guidelines States &amp; abide ones effect UK. don‚Äôt like smell taste either. Right New York follow science vaccinated people shouldn‚Äôt guidelines wear mask.

So work practice? know people fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm 15 getting mine 2 hours!  Exactly, I'm waiting vaccine kids. consider country whole. vaccinated. 

Also- pandemic continues among unvaccinated, still great risk variants breakthroughs. think missed ""LSAT"" part comment. Following science don‚Äôt like science anymore People often act like high risk kids exist, several family. One infant. would someone unvaccinated want publicly ‚Äúout‚Äù themselves? Many don‚Äôt want may feel shunned. bad move CDC. I've got know coming stuff. get people believing gullible scared managed convinced video Facebook someone somewhere came first. decided going make video lie covid vaccine? disgusting idea getting vaccine. vaccine approved 6mo+ want keep sarcasm sans critical thinking, go ahead. think it'll work long term though. gots save Ok something help economy everyone takes Agh! Get 5g juice away me!  Yeah. question actual number cohort is. People tend overinflate 30% pop. may low 10%. that's nothing, natural immunity definitely help bring case numbers people get vaccinated. still public safety issue. vaccinated stuff too?

I assume make tags dogs, maybe look pet shops. I‚Äôm trying empathy nervous new cdc guidance, unvaccinated people lying status going maskless makes nervous...then hell point vaccine?  Natural immunity generally less robust, open reinfections variants, leaves people permanent disabilities. (VOVWORLD) -¬†A 89-year-old woman COVID-19 died Saturday, becoming Vietnam's 36th coronavirus death first eight months.

""Patient 3839"" died ""underlying conditions,"" according National Steering Committee Covid-19 Prevention Control.

She diagnosed severe pneumonia due COVID-19, advanced respiratory failure, diabetes, hypertension, among others.

The patient lived Thuan Thanh District northern province Bac Ninh. made contact coronavirus case tested positive Thursday.

She supported ventilators extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), among measures stave infections.   Fake news! me. mean yeah vaccinated plan enjoying maskless benefits per CDC! 

Next time I'm going store mask free new hit movie comes summer munching popcorn mask free well! two weeks... *new hospitalizations deaths, cases. chance someone vaccinated getting sick dying catching covid practically nil. 

I interested eradicating covid - that‚Äôs impossible goal. interested controlling with... surprise... vaccines.  tend avoid places regular Flu season. think places still wear mask.  hospital still requires masks.

CDC guideline update masks specified masks still need worn hospitals. disappointed. shopping fridge magnets stick arm new type fashion accessory.  True, add confirmed natural immunity get accurate picture.  hate headlines. Pfizer invested lot capital took many risks developing vaccines. Many vaccines different companies even make throught development. 

The value vaccines bring society huge fine making profit. 

Whats even funny six months ago nobody cared discuss this. now, see light end tunnel articles constantly pop up. doesn‚Äôt matter. don‚Äôt need fear vaccine Woo! Vaccines go brrrrrr!

Get friends family vaccinated! Maybe Bill Gates allowed add nanochips vaccines would easily let know someone vaccinated. safe period isn‚Äôt % vaccinated. safe period begins new cases drop acceptable level. We‚Äôre talking maybe another month gradual easing. new mask mandate side effect reducing mask usage tremendously among unvaccinated may prolong pandemic. don‚Äôt get hard wear fucking mask another month so. I‚Äôm really tired people saying keeps people breathing. Liars. might comfortable, one died wearing mask. People died COVID 

We would well people followed rules beginning

This can‚Äôt nice things... Transplanted masshole thank much. I've lived areas country, small towns 20,000 people large cities. 

If near major chain, pickup options. That's fact. Unreliably, yes. Oh get it. must wait every single person country swears pinky oath vaccinated. it?

LOL jeez!!!!!!!!! Might well lock house rest life then! right thing, get vaccinated get life! believe would easier people handle children made eligible vaccine. eventually happens, peace mind anyone wants get vaccinated/protected so. hear you.

And present Texas Florida.
They experiment everyone else, look Partially*

Which still good, especially seeing many states hitting gjves warm fuzzy. üòõ Seriously, everything enjoyed pre-covid open pretty damn limited lol.  got haircut day generally conservative hadn‚Äôt gotten vaccine yet. wore mask informed covid (‚Äúno ones lost smell one covid‚Äù). 

She made comment vaccinated individuals still required wear masks - effective vaccines?

It‚Äôs fine line cross obviously liars there‚Äôs also segment people incentivize get vaccines. Great, then. mean considering similar % standard infections end death, right statistic meaningful. out, figures going missing large number infected/carriers seeking testing mild symptoms. health departments government offices going allocate resources test people feel sick.  agree mother. 4 year old. really worried could survive covid, worried lasting side effects gets it.

[Fully vaccinated? ditch mask, CDC ~~Houston~~ New York problem.  Yep, isn‚Äôt outbreak among players, it‚Äôs older individuals would likely get sick vaccine. player vaccinated, also reinfection case üòû need to. 1/3 Americans already exposed. I'm certain people refusing vaccine much likely already exposed. Black people historically used test faulty vaccines + medicine like infamous tuskegee study. legitimate reason hesitant even ultimately isn‚Äôt true That‚Äôs effed... maybe bumped bonus $200 might work. read article days ago, I'm completely sure exactly discussed.

However, key point discussion guaranteed hour two.

My second vaccine shot 1.5 hours away home. Availability better now, people rural areas without cars, still problem.

A lot people experience bad side effects days. ability take time off, barrier. Y‚Äôall trusting vaccine developed like less year. It‚Äôs political trust it? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That's like .04% deaths, 0.0003% children, 0.00008% population country. 

We make wide-ranging public health restrictions guidelines level risk profile. never have, definitely start now. 

With mindset mandate people forced stay inside storm since 1 700,000 chance struck lightning, statistically far greater chance dying COVID child. 90% going happen. Probably rare see adult mask Alabama well... countries can‚Äôt attract businesses tax rate, reduce tax. Netherlands fine attracts lots business. Reasons vaccinated keep wearing masks even though protected: 


1 unvaccinated people immunocompromised people home. 
2 around unmasked unvaccinated people want aid spread. (going Walmart, Costco, Trader Joes example) 
3 easier one consistant policy situational. need keep mask case try enter store still requires mask, supposed do? show pocket? Youre supposed touch front mask seems impractical. 
4 dont want explain others assume youre anti-mask. 
5 know long immunity lasts. 
6 want put others ease. 


I see negatives, ""not letting go"", ""living fear"" ""not believing science"".  articles indicating mRNA vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. Pretty clear J&amp;J doesn‚Äôt. Social conformity mandates required conform definitely effective. States removed mandates prematurely paid price. suck, describing people high risk take precautions. true new guidance true after. 

Yeah seems like people forgot immunocompromised people existed covid. think slow announcing benefits rewards vaccination. beginning erred side caution, downplaying effectiveness. get vaccinated still wear masks social distance? 

I would think prospect life getting back normal would incentive enough.  stop short believing mandates, firings, travel restrictions unvaccinated. think that's overstepping. much hesitancy beginning well would work antivaxxers running despite clear evidence contrary. I‚Äôm worried stuff happens right afterward. right rates drop, like flu. like flu, people get sick, die, people risk must navigate world regardless. could stop world flu like Covid too, flu policy reflects point becomes personal healthcare decision, holding back society protect would worse illness.

Also vaccination rates low US? Around 50% population least one dose nationally, one dose still confers significant protection. Removing masking requirements gives people *more* incentive vaccinate, apart would vaccinate matter what. So, appears masshole. New England different rest country relatively close everything else. perspective seems rather skewed this.

Especially since arguing multiple people saying simply true.

Maybe, maybe, wrong assumption.

Plus, there's also entirety planet outside US consider... Disgusting idea rain delay last Saturday coaches staff members small unventilated room several hours. Since team longer need wear masks likely weren‚Äôt. Unclear ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù group is. Oh many scientists inside CDC institutions understand gradual easing safer approach. Including Fauci. 

We‚Äôll see midsummer right. Remember post. Okay, explain cell reception mysteriously better month ago. Hey, Irish person here, United States America reach 70-80% threshold herd immunity view?  move shit mind now? go well rule teeth. people remove masks say got shot. people selfish. Avoid topic political posts. Yeah depends go. I've Alabama times last year folks liberal cities like Huntsville Birmingham wear masks. Go rural town like Mentone nobody wears one.  Socilism start, right now, working class dosnt chance hell obtaning real foothold.

What saying comunism, looks good paper, often leads extream corruption governments part, capatilisms better thougb

There rich people, taxes make haveing much assets expensive.

What describing giant huge step, socilism smaller step right direction, thats paletable. It‚Äôs sad you‚Äôre getting downvoted. provide real reason people delaying getting vaccine you‚Äôre downvoted doesn‚Äôt match want think want world Every virus potential long term consequences. get hyped much media. Masks on! Also, 12-15 year olds another 5 weeks masks getting vaxxed week. Definitely douchey, don‚Äôt it. want technocracy :(  me, probably 7 day average local case counts 30s. saw numbers last July, know aren‚Äôt unreasonable. They‚Äôve 200s throughout winter started going opened vaccines everyone. Right 7 day average 62.  study pretty clear.

The concern raised is, study control people able willing lie avoid wear masks? CT lifting May 19th CDC clearly saying new guidelines vaccinated individuals. 

It businesses governments follow and/or enforce guidelines. trust anything? drive new cars? Ride new elevators? Stand new buildings? Use new electronics appliances? trust experts / professionals countless fields every day keep us safe. don‚Äôt see different. don‚Äôt trust ‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù either, trust career professional doctors, researchers, pharmacists job best like do.    even hear say?   bit prejudiced eh? Probably little bit overstatement attribute years flu results solely mask wearing. Behavior beyond substantially changed - many holiday gatherings way scaled back? would work people easily manipulated. Oh... Yeah, it'll probably work. way God's green earth we/the government going know 100% every citizen vaccinated! surely going force 30 40% Americans vaccinated refuse it!

So mean 50/60/70 percent right thing got vaccinated must stay inside homes cowering fear forever CDC says vaccinated ditch mask?

Its over! Ready America! figure 4th July things done gonna fantastic summer!

For vaccinated. You‚Äôre missing point. People without masks unvaccinated around children. That‚Äôs dangerous them. 

Not mention, vaccinated people still getting spreading COVID. Look Yankees situation. No. likely lie. 

An honour system doesn‚Äôt work people large honour. Yeah I‚Äôd recommend getting anti body test getting vaccine. side effects body responding perceives Covid, antibodies recognize anything similar entering system, shoot first ask questions later. 

In boss‚Äô case, dumbass neglected inform nurse recovered Covid recently didn‚Äôt know would make difference (in defense one asked either). page CDC show 434 kids died flu  anything nothing given time, taking possible positions. It‚Äôs hoax, it‚Äôs exaggerated, it‚Äôs real someone else‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs over, here‚Äôs vaccine thing may may exist- don‚Äôt really need it‚Äôs bestowed upon etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs whether children *die*. It‚Äôs mutations.

Every single case presents opportunity new variants. Yes. includes children. let disease rip children that‚Äôs millions chances mutate.

Oh, also lot people mild covid (including young) permanent damage sense taste. that‚Äôs nice gift child‚Äôs life. Narcolepsy too. Unless point incorrect election poll done sociologists, comparison falls flat. election poll done Rasmussen bearing sociologists. 

My brain doesn‚Äôt shut down. value data top level education. 

I don‚Äôt want speculate believe things believe. feel bad Dr Hotez. getting bullied like crazy antivaxx community extent death threats. weak qualitative survey. sound completely ass. Reposting different comment made address this:

I don‚Äôt think 30 overinflated. 32.9 million cases recorded us. 10% already. Assuming caught 1/3 cases 30%. sure natural immunity resistant variants vaccine, reason aren‚Äôt true herd immunity yet. Pretty sure numbers locked sort victory, least now, though. CDC wouldn‚Äôt surprise drop mask mandates unless encouraging math side.

Point least 30, although people also gotten vaccinated, isn‚Äôt necessarily additional 30 top vaccinated population CDC doctor Maddow last night said new transportation policy coming soon. multiple agencies involved working guidance now. They‚Äôve already done that. coworker shower video event went Houston last week. huge indoor sporting arena like size staple center mask site. It‚Äôs reasonable worried it. I‚Äôm Texas, vaccination rates behind states mask mandates almost never enforced. number people would wear mask nose absurd. Even still, case numbers continue decline. Lifting mask guidance CDC doesn‚Äôt change much practice don‚Äôt expect change trajectory Covid cases either. That's nice theoretical terms all, thing reality separate rules vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. lift restrictions ""vaccinated"" people lifting ""unvaccinated"" people too, way confirm verify anything. 

Republicans narrative blame anti mask anti vaxx views various things talk. bet approach 70% less serious holdouts (the slightly hesitant ones) eventually go get it. Doubt diehards capitulate anytime soon though think Pfizer big corporation that?! ""Peter Jay Hotez (born May 5, 1958) American scientist, pediatrician, advocate fields global health, vaccinology, neglected tropical disease control"" 


and apparently ability read peoples minds never met decipher motivations are.   whew,,,, Adding that, I‚Äôm Singapore population doesn‚Äôt tolerate leakage community, even though cases per capita way US UK. We‚Äôve achieved near-zero cases several months now, super-spreader events Indian variant shot case counts around 20-30 day. response? tomorrow onwards, government effectively mandated semi-lockdown mingle one person, eateries stop dine-in services.

These numbers countries wouldn‚Äôt caused much panic, it‚Äôs Singapore, we‚Äôve almost seen failure fight virus.  be. CT lifting Wednesday (19th) bozo Cuomo want look like outlier Murphy (NJ) make announcement either Monday Tuesday also saying rhey lifting rhe mask mandate. Hes waitinf weekend makes rhe announcement say ""he consulted weekend scientific professionals"" So, what‚Äôs suggestion? Asking good faith. right time go back resemblance ‚Äúnormal‚Äù given continue immunocompromised children article several days old projection. must young english class made definition irony yet. 15 years ago every major pharmaceutical company pretty much except Pfizer shutting vaccine development see money it. Pfizer making money continued investment important medical area. Full stop. point, make possible sell generics diseases sooner others.

Now avoiding taxes another thing. CDC absolute shit show past several months, finally got something right. broken clock still right 2 times day guess. Fortunately demand actual n95 masks dropped sharply available cheap market ($2 mask). Instead wearing 'face coverings' nothing chin diapers, someone wants mask get legitimately good one open market. think time people decide risk themselves.

Personally, I'll wearing mask shopping groceries, flying, etc. plan wear workplace (where separate rooms). Pfizer makes profit sales vaccines rich countries profit sales vaccines developing countries. Countries like EU countries US issues paying fair price Pfizer asking (much less vaccines) don‚Äôt think 30 overinflated. 32.9 million cases recorded us. 10% already. Assuming caught 1/3 cases 30%. sure natural immunity resistant variants vaccine, reason aren‚Äôt true herd immunity yet. Pretty sure numbers locked sort victory, least now, though. CDC wouldn‚Äôt surprise drop mask mandates unless encouraging math side.   reason bother, right

It study - give people choice observe incentivized them. survey feelings perceptions. (Given, survey low level study. low level results given weight deserve.) 

They asked opinions opinions facts behaviors. There's reason think removing mask mandates, without proof necessary, incentivize anyone get vaccinated. wildly different amounts people vaccinated state state basis, lower ones ~35%. It‚Äôs possible give policy floor low. curious - getting stat from? ya bad, brain fart

I meant 2019 flu year literally got glasses week. Lucky mandates drop time. understand that. really really nice going entire year without cold flu. Mask even helped allergies. would acceptable return normal than? every single person country antibodies?  sound ridiculous. taking flimsy survey study gospel. Plus even stores implemented 100% vaccine card compliance checks front door forced unvaccinated put mask entering, unless stores person escort unvaccinated randomly spot check people store nothing unvaccinated people removing mask let store.

This policy even based entirely science behind epidemiology COVID-19, either lacks data human behavior since pandemic started, decided science isn‚Äôt needed decision taking overly optimistic naive stance compliance rules. Yeah, notoriously terrible‚Ä¶Netherlands? What's happening India devastating, anyone really surprised? matter time. Look proximity people live many areas. Quite unsanitary well. Nice also realize viruses long term lifelong symptoms Covid. asked people ‚Äúhow likely would get vaccinated meant longer wear mask?‚Äù control condition asked people ‚Äúhow likely would get vaccinated, regardless whether do, longer need wear mask.‚Äù would comparison would generalize meaningfully current situation. 

You also mention consensus amongst experts move increase vaccine uptake. Um, NO. consensus exist. I‚Äôm social psychologist (the so-called ‚Äúexpert human behavior‚Äù) colleagues collectively like ‚Äúwhat fuck, CDC?‚Äù happened basically CDC saying everyone take masks, even need vaccinated. Nobody checking. Something like based completely honor system going motivate anyone get vaccinated already want own. Well disagree! It‚Äôs misapplied say people likely get vaccinated vaccination results relaxed guidelines themselves. That‚Äôs exactly study says. 

The study likely didn‚Äôt influence policy. 

But CDC‚Äôs new guidelines reflect findings study. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

""We still learning well vaccines prevent spreading virus causes COVID-19 others, even symptoms. Early data show vaccines help keep people symptoms spreading COVID-19."" 

#The stated form least four times children infected SARS-CoV-2 less likely develop severe illness compared adults, children still risk developing severe illness complications COVID-19.   Reddit seems attract people want authoritarian government long whatever policies want. Trust science. 

Your Twitter research doesn‚Äôt make expert. 

Do know better cdc? Anyone else notice incredible cell service since getting vaccine? haven‚Äôt single dropped call since got second shot. vaccine keeps getting better better! Absolutely. need view issues appropriate nuance. makes sense everyone mask one vaccinated. high risk populations vaccinated unvaccinated individuals generally low probability complications, mask mandate longer makes sense. ‚Ä¶and therefore likely go ahead get vaccinated. probably reason CDC making change. fence, waiting bit, unsure, etc. likely feel bit pressure now. adults teens vaccinated, potential significant community spread keep dropping dropping - thus protecting 11-and-under crowd can't vaccinated medical reasons.  They'll less likely exposed covid first place, even vaccinated person catches covid, mild asymptomatic cases much lower viral load unlikely contagious.   
Most K-12 schools require annual flu vaccine school requires kids wear masks flu season - covid poses comparable level risk severe illness death influenza children.  Parents course able take whatever measures see fit children, population level demanding protective measures kids significant always done flu. risk-benefit analysis children must considered separately analysis adults.  
Since confirmed aerosol transmission dominates, masks really matter PPE source control. cloth masks surgical masks wearing suitable PPE comes aerosol transmission - fit-tested respirator is. concerned, I'd recommend getting KN95s KF94s son he's eligible vaccination, much sure thing banking others' masks protect him. take? believe whole Pandemic hoax created Democrats make Trump look bad loses election. belief also goes say Trump office Democrats take world impose one government kill good chunk planet. 5,936 children could die 100% child population exposed distinct possibility covid spreads easier flu. Based quick Google source says approximately 74.2 million children US. 

I would liked CDC allowed weeks vaccinations happen telling everyone could go without masks. big motivating factor people know fence whether get vaccine could go maskless sooner. clear advocate mask requirements longer another month now. people lwgit health issues cant get it? Fuck em?

How children? Yeah deaths low long term health effects covid cause? 

We need people vaxxed. gotta pressure fence hesistant. I'll say louder kids back class.

We know brain body long term. go dormant brain? flare like herpes shingles? Make susceptible disease road? 

We glossing kids present less severity.

Why ignoring basic callout covid? pretty clear, let's see happens practice.  Ayyyy Kansas City gang represent, stoked ever since saw Jackson County dropped mandates! Well want money back then. Netherlands thousands international corporations based due low taxation location Europe. companies employ thousands employees offices logistics (including work myself) help increase employment levels income tax revenue. wouldn‚Äôt exactly call race bottom Netherlands stable financial situation. It‚Äôs worth considering reason medical developments take long money red tape. world shut down, threw money ditched unnecessary red tape. question isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow happen quickly?‚Äù rather, ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt learn make system work better faster going forward?‚Äù  1) likely doesn‚Äôt mean impossible. 2) data cdc seems drawing studies using mRNA vaccines, whereas Yankees got JnJ. Correct I‚Äôm wrong one. 3) Yankees situation still anomaly. It‚Äôs weird it‚Äôs happened public way, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs common. team travels together around country lessened restrictions. I'm surprised happened often. Going 1% per day, great pace. somewhat early stores (Costco great). stopped quickly covidiots decided going shoot someone asked wear mask...smh. vaccine exactly supposed you‚Äôre scared shitless?

How get Reddit work concrete hermetically sealed bunker? mean CDC anything aggressive guidance. There‚Äôs reason think info Reddit better recommend. 

Everything priced foe CDC, know relying honor system mean country large open things back continue ask people wear mask indoor public spaces. honestly dropping seems disrespectful eligible yet eligible long enough fully vaccinated. Maybe drop earlier certain types places age restrictions(like bars), 8 weeks youngest person allowed eligible vaccine, allow time people actually get vaccinated. Right...so, selfishly want 99% population suffer suffer...

You reason us done sniffles 14 months sick tired last 14 months...

You want safe...wear mask...

Don‚Äôt make rest us suffer you‚Äôre it... Also remotely sane person would realize unmasked public got LOT risky.

They either 1) accept risk 2) wear mask 3) get vaccinated.

There significant number people take option 2 3. technically tested positive cases discovered mandatory MLB testing. such, it‚Äôs really sort grey area. count true positives? truth truth regardless speaks it.


Are facts less factual they‚Äôre presented someone don‚Äôt like? South Korea ran problem getting false-positive re-infections right left tests picking dead viral material thanks Biden kamala!!! &lt;3 point people take responsibility actions!

That time year ago longer! waaaaay past time anti vax doubters right thing! move life leave people whatever want it‚Äôs business. directly contradict CDC said? vaccinated still reservations seeing non-vaccinated friends/family.

I'm voting you.

Do get vaccinated. see them. pointing difficulties current state science bureaucracies fund discrediting whole system? probably mean way came across way me. Might wanna rethink 'Good News' flair this... change lifestyle them? Yep, they‚Äôre betting risk increased transmission less benefit increased vaccinations. far know, export ban skin color written it.  30% country fully vaxed curiously 87% Walmart customers appear work publix posted portal today fully vaccinated employees longer required wear masks starting may 15th. personally going continue wearing mine know many wont. really effect whether customers wear since publix know actually enforces rule told allowed mention customers need wear mask ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è thought possibility hope that's case, still struggling reconcile idea one person could infect 8 people unless literally place thing. also would expected vaccines prevent infection least point, 90-95% effective preventing severe outcomes got J&amp;J stab week ago solely Europe said would allow vaccinated Americans summer...

Until now, U.S. gave incentive otherwise...and ways, state (NY) actually actually given reason vaccinated... would gradually though? Tell people wear masks half time? year data enough (to say likely long term effects)? mean CDC know anyone else unfortunately crystal ball. Also, CDC place thing made wrong call once. believe CEOs could replaced one executives lower cost business would well. believe caught within 14 days receiving j&amp;j vaccine important thing note efficacy goes considerably 14 days. one me! Exactly. someone can‚Äôt yet get vaccinated (pregnant opting wait discussing OB), *me* problem. upgraded standard surgical masks kn95s continuing vigilant avoiding high risk situations. someone can‚Äôt won‚Äôt get vaccine, becomes responsibility safe. course places like hospitals likely risk people, it‚Äôs reasonable still require masking. say otherwise would like requiring universal ban peanut products people severe allergies them. onus falls risk person take responsibility health.  like enforced challenged time, stop now. That's completely fair terrible idea. obviously afraid go event quickly left. necessarily blamed either honestly avoiding pretty minor risk chosen go. 

So lived life took minor risk annoying honestly super easy thing minimize risk. likely someone positive spread them. Cause workers aren‚Äôt viewed source company‚Äôs value, mere cogs replaced stop working. founders/executives painted tony stark-like geniuses make everything run. LOL see üòÅ Maybe masked around old father instead blaming people mistakes? times tried order Kroger last months stock half items. pandemic squeeze, every store town shit needed I've given ahead news.

Kroger strikes extremely shitty version Safeway. clarify keep expectations check haven‚Äôt read article considering Universal trip:

Masks still required rides attractions ‚Äúfrom moment guests enter queue exit experience‚Äù ‚Äî applies *even if* queue ride/attraction outside. So, considering long lines get summer, you‚Äôre still looking keep mask *lot* Orlando heat. 

They‚Äôre also still required restaurants shops, well common areas Universal‚Äôs onsite hotels.

So, really, mask relief provides generally walking around parks.

I hope rules continue ease summer progresses.

Edited add: vaccination status doesn‚Äôt matter far updated rules. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt gain additional mask relief. Removed now, either given hug death Trader Joe‚Äôs removed it. Well much ever reaching herd immunity country. real  greater zero number people who: follow law, don‚Äôt want wear masks inside, didn‚Äôt previously find value getting vaccinated. Yes, many people lie wear mask, think reddit under-estimates number vaccine-hesitant people follow law. people see ripping mask going store going follow rules, want everyone know aren‚Äôt happy it. people wearing masks incorrectly stores.

Now, hand, don‚Äôt think people follow law respect it, don‚Äôt want get trouble look bad. rules enforcement, maybe won‚Äôt much effect. Luckily wait week see happens. realize chances struck lighting step house probably greater fully vaccinated person getting covid one, go hospital two actually dying three, right?

Are never going come house then?  enter stores without face coverings 

Did people attitude (not getting vaccinated wearing mask) refrain going stores prior this? really doubt case. way effective that. mistaken way efficacy measured things.

This false. effective vaccines pfizer moderna vaccines around cloth masks people wear lower 95% effective, yet people comfortable leaving house wearing those. thing 0 risk life target. thing 0 risk life target. 

Yeah that's kind whole reason supposed wear them, get close zero possible. I'm sure argument trying make vaccines work protect vaccinated others threat vaccinated person.

see  put sign up. Enforcement ? knows far employees go. feels like another premature victory lap making. Brace surprises. government twisting arm mean can't take precautions, although unlikely spreader. CDC moving direction. Soft luxurious select goose feather mattresses cabana boy fanning palm leaves cool climate controlled atriums size aircraft hangar. nope, kinda government stop paying care anyone able get vaccine.

If get sick on: go bankrupt like illness.

It‚Äôs kinda nuts avoid vaccine get free medical care, responsible person get financially ruined.

Closing loophole would push people get vaccinated. Employers may even require keep premiums down. Like babies $200,000 mattresses. quite enjoy wearing mask public spaces now. Hides face, sick since whole started. 

Even better work boss can't see face telling something ridiculous.   think there's difference *endemic* disease ongoing *epidemic.*

Not quite sure cool crap people nothing bad, helping. educate us long term effects covid children later life? think that's bigger concern people point, major illness death. known. unknown mention above.

Tbh might continue wearing I‚Äôm busy indoor places like stores etc. Corporations US heartless‚Ä¶ profits execs. Kroger even nice. one worst places shop groceries. Shelves constantly low stock, produce quality worse walmarts. Isles crammed made worse in-isle displays make possible fit 1 shopping cart isle. Lines ridiculous constantly put single items bags themselves. understand massive business get. lot people internet realize mask wearing never requirements choice, basically social conformity. almost everyone wears masks supposed wear masks, 80%-95% people do.

When say people wear them, mask wearing drop 64% (the percentage people fully vaccinated), drop 5-10% less less people wear masks, less less people wear masks.

That's fine vaccinated DGAF COVID, kid 12, immunocompromised, able schedule appointment yet, wearing typical cloth mask cuts COVID exposure viral load 50%. protection mask adherence distancing others. gone, vulnerable again. young kid, can't wear N95, 2 can't even wear mask.

Even vaccinated, risk still high enough cost mask wearing low enough that, statistically, still wear mask. There's much bigger chance catching COVID vaccinated getting car accident. still wear seat belt, right?

So problem CDC parroted reality vaccinated, pretty well protected. risk needs public policy ENTIRELY different. tell people probably okay drink 5 beers drive there's probably low chance get wreck, probably need wear condom MF heterosexual sex really low likelihood getting AIDS, true statement. Public health that, public, considering community affected, people behave, done make us safer.

CDC could said need security theatre, need arbitrary capacity limits, need random testing, tangibly expensive stuff. instead that, effectively getting rid cheap effective solution public masking, folks apparently touch realize making announcement. people doesn‚Äôt matter, enforcing doesn‚Äôt matter either. policy makes perfect sense‚Ä¶people choose path. knew going end effective vaccines right?  Trader Joe‚Äôs pretty libertarian slanted company attracts lot left leaning people reason.

I wouldn‚Äôt shocked declare stores sovereign states play legal system whole thing null void. Many people simply won‚Äôt aren‚Äôt required to. people wearing masks protects child better child wearing mask (though good). u/raanne right. We‚Äôre quite yet. advocating forced vaccinations. advocating society reason science respected, people willing make small sacrifices benefit fellow citizens.

That small sacrifice involves getting vaccine, wearing mask literally everywhere rest life. that's case, masking become normalized like handwashing there's need government mandates. Kids 12 can‚Äôt get vaccine yet. 2 home.

No way hell we‚Äôre going without masks they‚Äôre fully vaccinated, many families won‚Äôt careful.

And don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúkIdS wOn‚ÄôT dIe iT.‚Äù Thanks, helpful. still get sick spread it. safely hang without masks. want wear mask can, vaccinated virtually pointless wear one, especially private setting.

Have fun! mandate whether work place super market. numerous studies effectiveness masks. science would different rules places low community spread high vaccination places high community spread low vaccination numbers.

Myself family sore arms. reaction flu shot, me. trust people honest? No. feel like I, vaccinated individual, significant risk people wearing mask? Also no. can‚Äôt let society designed around irrational thinking

Our society based mostly irrational thinking. Certain overly large subsets prefer leaning hard irrational recklessness rather using amount caution put someone else risk. go scientists medical experts telling me. said need stay masked another two months, fine would done that. said.

Maybe know do. hope everything comes good yours. Funny, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated California, and, also anecdotal, fully vaccinated friends family (and myself) say they‚Äôll still wear mask local ordinance lifts mandate.


*still wear mask places like Wal Mart Yeah especially India. High genetic diversity population increases chances mutation well. 

Honestly would much rather sending money seas people make vaccines blow people up. apparently blowing people industry never end.  shit  wish could made Fall whenever kids could get vaccinated.

Overall, started getting control we're rolling vaccines US, plenty hot spots pockets antimaskers antivaxxers keeping cases high. new guidance, I'm 100% sure cases spike again. trust data vaccinated people less likely catch COVID transmit others, think much spike actually vaccinated people, doubt antivaxxers go maskless too. want return normalcy much everyone, felt way safer going knowing everyone needed wear masks indoors, instead trusting vaccinated people will. system place tracking vaccinated, can't really anyways much freedom personal rights tied Americanism, even freedom endanger others. 

Plus, bet going antimask/antivax people harassing people wear masks, including people actually cannot get vaccine age, health, etc. many unvaccinated individuals area could cause increase viral load and/or variants increase risk ""breakthrough"" infection. law federal government mandate public transit air travellers need wear masks. feds requiring it, therefore mandated federal law. statute law governing purview DOT, TSA agencies. Right u/carlsab saying us fully vaccinated folks almost nothing worry anymore. received even least one dose much better shape still holding out. people still holding really bringing risk themselves. vaccines became widely available refusing mask distancing guidelines risk everyone around them. longer case. sarcastic comment. Given lifting restrictions, double current vaccine numbers, we're fucked come next fall/winter. CDC, current federal administration, practically every single state government seems disagree you. aware variants still felt massive rollback public health measures warranted. Depending state live in, would already two incentives. Ok, 24 hours second Pfizer shot ""symptom"" first. sore arm, feels like knot muscle. Sore touch sore lift arm, nothing. fever, chills, achiness, nothing.

According research read, already pretty safe first shot. two weeks, good go. glad finally putting thing behind us. Daughter turns 16 weeks, friends already fully vaccinated. can't wait normal interaction friends. pisses early several Chinese vaccines excellent preclinical results. probably came little teams competent.

Colour shocked. Bless little hearts. Thoughts prayers etc. Ideally would reach herd immunity first thats gonna happen anti Vax propaganda. likely 2/3rds vaccinated, maybe bit less. IL dropping mandate within next weeks example. love years we've gone people caring/paying attention politics caring WAY much.. State California removed mask mandate, CDC guidelines supersede State regulations. Why? government tell cannot harm someone. 

If give someone HIV, charged murder. 

The spread COVID-19 threatens individual(s), also puts severe strain public health safety infrastructure resources.  really blows mind can‚Äôt candidate politics pro small business, pro lower taxes, also believe science environment. know statistics (and hard say long haulers get much attention) certainly seems like insignificant risk uniform across US, makes federal-level recommendations difficult. people common sense, huh?

Personally, I‚Äôm masking 1) it‚Äôs mandatory (store/hospital), 2) know I‚Äôll around lot likely unvaccinated people. 

Vaccination rates ~ 50% live. 

I‚Äôd curious know vaccination rates local church congregations could choose smart one feel safe going without bringing COVID home immune compromised wife. pet theory calculated gamble part CDC.

In 5 weeks, inflection rates would already plummeted substantially lazy get vaccinated would really much incentive so. comment makes sense. Thanks sharing.

Yeah think got lucky SARS research rely on. vaccine rollout quickly done, considering urgent need makes sense.

With couple hundred million vaccinations far, hopefully lingering questions around safety answered soon. Case fatality rate equal true fatality rate least one dose, total state population: 49.6%.

At least one dose, 18+ population: 61.4%.

Completed vaccine series (2 doses Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna, 1 dose Johnson &amp; Johnson), total population: 41.3%

Completed vaccine series, 18+: 51.5%

I give shit variant forms stupid anti-vaxxers partially vaccinated people partying resistant current vaccines setting us right back full pandemic mode could've avoided waiting bit longer lifting restrictions tying restrictions state/local vaccination rates instead sweeping nationwide rule.

My big beef lot rural areas low vaccination rates 100% open don‚Äôt care mask usage. Um, realize isnt easy arrange babysitting Covid times either, right?  Yes, dishonest people honest now. recently, whenever anti-vaxxer/masker decided show someplace without mask, could told put one leave. can't, especially since increasingly stores dropping mask policies.

The CDC's advice sound perfect world. live one. clearly see large portion country actively anti-mask anti-vax. Therefore, advice fact sound.

I agree care protecting willfully dishonest, lot children immunocompromised people currently unable vaccinated going affected, protected. live conspiracy theorist isn‚Äôt going get vaccinated, 100% go around without mask first opportunity. unvaccinated point, going need assume many people unmasked public unvaccinated.

Saying CDC ""MAY"" goofed people die this. Well like said, people still die even remove mask mandates 90% vaccinated. 10% still die it. 

Any additional exposures due new mask guidance may offset carrot effect pushes fence lazy go get vaccinated ASAP. people may die due additional exposure, maybe get saved due extra incentive go get vaccine. 

Your approach scientific despite plea science. know carrot effect stronger risk additional exposure due masking? 

That's keep saying, think CDC goofed mean anything. way study trend see plays out. CDC may made right decision incentivized people may actually save lives. Immunity levels country fairly strong risk want protect still mask distance. 

But hey random redditor keep making grand claims CDC get science. Yeah don‚Äôt think public transit actually changes likelihood COVID, it‚Äôs simply regulated via different agency. Shortly expect uniform policies. They‚Äôre probably worried bad publicity. optics dozen people getting rona climbing Everest. 

/s case wasn‚Äôt obvious  strange person fact might stretch, similar model minority myth?  
 
I think there's definitely connection there, especially factoring mask usage East Asia much moreso pollution disease. using people promote cause somewhat misrepresenting culture process. Lol  ironic thing misinformation proven COVID remains penile tissue actually cause Erectile Dysfunction... supposed get autism from?! animals incapable shame. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs comparable polls say saying do, though... can‚Äôt west probably, politically. months basically enforce policies make life miserable people could get vaccine choose to.

This means denying passports. Denying drivers licence renewals. Supporting businesses make covid vaccine requirement hiring (unless individual proves can‚Äôt medically get vaccine). would that? Draft people weekly PCR testing test positivity already low? one likes swabs. 

You can't use easy antibody tests vaccinated individuals strongly positive those. differences response require detailed tests. chance young child dies covid 1 million.   maybe lazy, entitled children contribute economy, government would reason care them! easy, gotta catch trickle-down pull little velcro bootstraps! don‚Äôt get religion intertwined politics. US unable stay secular government absolutely caused battle lines drawn things cut dry countries clear heartily agree intelligence agencies find state private lab involved this. unclear topic always seems start diatribe (a civilian) think Covid. 

If mysterious fire explosion lab someplace earth, perhaps ever know possible lab origin covid. experience completely unchanged. anti vax coworker quit fully vaxxed staff told didn‚Äôt wear masks anymore. said felt like picked required wear mask still. missed.

Also, wearing mask work felt crazy. I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre finally here. New studies showed promising data vaccine variants Historically, Black people good reasons suspicious medical industry whole. hesitancy assuaged watching rollout seeing it‚Äôs safe part. That‚Äôs already happening. real holdouts going people screaming kid catching autism MMR Covid. Yeah, think access socioeconomic issues anything else NJ. Damn yo....that‚Äôs funny af haha ok anxiety it, ok channel anxiety advocating massively harmful public policy like locking herd immunity reached. Cool! point everyone get vaccinated. severely asthmatic 5 year old young vaccine could end hospitalized worse catches covid. part protecting can‚Äôt protect themselves. it‚Äôs done yet. CDC premature this, it‚Äôs going cost lives. People like ‚Äúunvaccinated people going lie!!!‚Äù first person think CDC didn‚Äôt calculate risk  need culture masking preferably staying home symptomatically ill. 'Just cold' one individual might deadly another. Americans far selfish. People seem confuse mask mandates mask wearing. country redefined means person. child longer included people make arguements ""everyone"" eligible reason continue precautions get sick fault getting vaccinated. found remind children cannot vaccinated, response often ""who cares"" simply unlikely die. like parents expected offer children covid little care consideration future (or parents trying protect them). thats.. brilliant Fair, one think Tuskegee awful, maybe would change minds people knew, subjects GIVEN syphilis. withheld treatment. Obviously still horrible, racist, abuse people human rights. government try make black people sick event, used control syphilis study. Like said l, still evil, think people impression black people purposefully inoculated syphilis experiment.

Like said though, trauma isn‚Äôt logical, withholding treatment story doesn‚Äôt paint government much better light anyway  amount spread highest point created mutations still neutralized vaccines. Sars-Cov2 good error correction causes far fewer mutations influenza. Maybe one make through, one knows sure. Sooner people think, large portion anti vax population likely ones natural immunity getting virus already (reckless lifestyles pandemic anti vax ideology likely heavily correlated). Can't wait go old comments people told CT Facebook ask they'd like apologize. I'm guessing I'll get grand total zero That's slightly simplistic. Read recent update. mean let's act like flu shot great. get maybe 50% effectivity. less principle thing much ""can't arsed"" thing get sick die. also negatively impact state local economy.  mean think meant random people grocery store they? thought like family gatherings classrooms labs something. It‚Äôs individual safety issue since 99.9% adults easy access vaccine. Kids extremely unlikely bad bout Covid immunocompromised always going risk dealing illnesses whether it‚Äôs Covid something else. true... High five  think Trump cared vaccines narrowly self interested ""it help win election"" way. Afterwards, much. Like, got vaccinated privately unlike ex Presidents PSAs significant outreach. They‚Äôve saying 70-80% vaccination rate herd immunity since start pandemic. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs conspiracy here, makes sense solid super majority population needs vaccinated us reach herd immunity. novel problems mistakes made applies much USA China. US government can't weld people apartments go extremes China did, want to. worth it. Trump shut border Europe. handle virus well, one else would have. Biden also closed border India Brazil hasn't. 

I dont blame China virus spreading. virus, that's do. Covid contagious. would spread matter started. China also trustable virus numbers.

I dont know applying harsher standards US country point. better PPP stockpile sorts things. hope forget lessons, USA done lot better lot metrics countries. large nation perfect aspects this. It‚Äôs nice ass fair. That‚Äôs enforcement issue. 

I value data vaccination likelihood increases based CDC‚Äôs new guidelines. change would make require mask (vaxxed not) children vaxxed infection rates close zero, whichever comes first. continue services like online school high risk children.  don‚Äôt get comparing black/white dem/gop? One race, one political party? Doesn‚Äôt make sense compare different races, different political parties? Unless non-scientific reasons. 

Additionally, honestly don‚Äôt care peope say want get vaccine, either get don‚Äôt. Anyone say want vaccine, especially since know it‚Äôs prevailing opinion get vaccine. it‚Äôs becoming readily available, especially walk appointments, say want don‚Äôt take minimal steps actually get one, matter? 

Here data comparing races received : 

Will interesting see data evolves vaccines becoming much available (no refresh wars trying get spot), numbers match ‚Äúplanning get vaccine‚Äù serve incubators variants develop. Variants might turn work effectively vaccinated people. keep wearing masks out. order groceries, restaurant meals doors. long covid pandemic thing.

Why hard understand? vaccines here, work, science says start move back normal life again. special needs always done cases. 

I get point view, must say. car. Feelings care facts. never significant *that individual,* population level, immunity still contributes reduction possible vectors. Whatever say, rate things going mask mandates everywhere gone around Memorial Day mid-June resistant, everything completely back normal July. Eh rates super low cloth masks never really much anyway. don‚Äôt value data based reasons won‚Äôt speculate on. 

I would like likelihood vaccinations high possible! Probably they're confident level natural immunity. areas (particularly Brazil) thought enough natural immunity prevent another wave...and proved wrong. maybe immunity wanted, P.1 partially escape natural immunity, antibody-sampling estimate inflated--but reasons they're sure count lot exposed people provide herd immunity.

Most importantly US lots vaccines *have* depend natural immunity. Cool don‚Äôt stigmatize us aren‚Äôt going wear masks we‚Äôre vaccinated. think physical safety employees

Yeah, 100% going keep stores verifying vaccine status. I've one person try swing me, asking put mask work. imagine much worse would vaccine cards...  Awesome, basically kids Disney unvaccinated summer. I'm gonna hold vaccinate daughter even though really looking forward taking her. rarely watch cnn, Wednesday watched cuomo tear cdc lady. bizarro world democratic propaganda machine attack own. Sure enough next day over, cdc flipped white house flipped. Cuomo Cnn ended (warp speed/vax main reason) mask craziness ended Wed Cuomo. knew Walmart would follow ditch mask mandate since shopping without mask 2 months (about 25% customers wear masks AZ). expect Costco though hard core masks light switch came Thursday. never see young kids wearing masks I'm out. think parents think worth fights. people understand thin needle is?! would bit difficult shove microchip needle thin. also think people saying black people don‚Äôt trust government vaccines main reason falling behind vaccinations. economic thing. Many black people can‚Äôt afford take multiple days work side effects. Many wealthier white people work jobs taking day work easier. Blaming imbalance vaccine hesitancy easy way people ignore fact economic inequality plays huge part get vaccine Strain? Mutation? variant? Younger kids may eligible fall, best case. reason continue strict mandates population largely unaffected virus.  don‚Äôt think framed questions way claim. 

It would naive believe anonymous account performs occupation say do. keep seeing breathless tweets think pieces basically amount ‚Äúmy trauma means mask stays on‚Äù I‚Äôm like, okay, fine you, enjoy, I‚Äôm gonna follow advisory set CDC

Agreed. wearing mask non-medical reasons helps somebody deal mental issues, think right citizen free country wear one. understand think mental issues get dictate *my* fashion choices. Hell yes. much concern trolling going helpful know, thank you! Dumb

The man got vaxxed... relies ""honor system,"" misapplied.

If proof required, misapplied.

If find survey asked ""Would get vaccinated proof vaccination required discontinue masks?"" please link it. No, it‚Äôs log. Sure. lie. Depends reason getting vaccinated. Rt SARS-Cov2 high is, people eventually get infected. Either way, contribute herd immunity. Long term affect exist, know. mention lot pharmacies give store coupon taking it.  Illinois killin it, think we've 1600 cases Saturday since last year. could wrong. Risk Covid children small.

Its possible driving store dangerous. mean totally agree, think ignored airborne aspect help keep restaurants businesses alive. Otherwise pretty much everything shut down. 

I think CDC point treat COVID like flu risk vulnerable small, keeping restrictions going economically viable. Keep mind data collected back February. Vaccination uptake increased good bit since Don‚Äôt forget also Fauci mother changing shit filled diapers one time Also, sun rose today. anti-masker victory day. past year taught us honor system public health doest work America. 24 year old online gamer buddy thinks sense taste didn‚Äôt come back completely. deadly maybe, he‚Äôs awfully young rest life. Equating desire die virus

How strong desire anyway? according whole pandemic preventable. Humans also ones actively destroy habitat creatures naturally carry sorts viruses, also ones eat animals live close proximity them. one forced us those..  Yeah, comes back issue low paid retail worker want deal this. Upvote correct use ""flout""! state in? thought states successful vax campaigns seeing case declines ‚ÄúWalmart stop requiring masks‚Äù want anymore variants though... CDC accounted lack mask compliance confusion said masks aren‚Äôt effective started recommend masks? try fix obvious problem hand (at time - mask shortages, - vaccine adoption) don‚Äôt think through. left grocery store. Definitely not. Never gonna happen country, guaranteed. schools businesses require that's it. zombie apocalipse, would zombie rights defenders. beautiful thing makes think actually getting COVID won‚Äôt worse? Republicans immersed much disinformation don‚Äôt know anymore.   everyone chance get yet... New York require businesses kick unmasked customers?

I could see customer potentially getting fine, believe business liable that. three children 5 including infant. won‚Äôt taking grocery store I‚Äôll stick getting delivery.... like last 12 months. I‚Äôm okay masks coming off. need start taking personal risk assessment benefits greater good society whole. contrast, nearly everyone know got negative side affects sore shoulder feeling tired. honestly don‚Äôt know anyone said person social media they‚Äôve negative experience receiving vaccine. hesitancy many get misinformation there, willing get anyway right thing do, saw many family friends went fine. trust science got vaccine sooner expected. vaccine family lead many future cures that‚Äôll help humanity overcome worst diseases. covidiots don‚Äôt realize refuse admit. fatality rate ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1%. However 1% 300 million 3 million. hospitalized causes intense burnout among care givers shortage people trained willing care them. There‚Äôs risk caring trauma victim ICU huge risk caring somebody dangerous highly contagious disease. Nurses lining risks. family member manages nurses major city hospital saying biggest challenge filling shifts. can‚Äôt even get steady supply traveling contract nurses. Everyone overtime snd on-call. many quit, retired took leave etc etc another wave would definitely make worse. Give rest man Wow super ignorant. Wow, someone missed point completely. Also, still businesses let without mask, vaccinated not. there's that. They‚Äôre already testing toddlers above. I‚Äôm hoping month they‚Äôll EULA. wait vaccine induced herd immunity, lift mask mandates everyone. scientifically doesn‚Äôt make sense anxious stuck pandemic. Even fear variant might nullify vaccine, always rest world people vaccinated Covid spreading it. 

There‚Äôs much besides offer vaccine everyone wants one. haven‚Äôt checked maybe 2 months, back CDC estimating almost 100 million US COVID. would assume half COVID also conservative ideology won‚Äôt get vaccine. know personally. Hard say ~2/3 Americans get vaccinated think least 10% would amount natural immunity. COVID definitely isn‚Äôt going away booster shot may also won‚Äôt delayed roll like initial shot was. want everyone get vaccine, point people don‚Äôt mostly them. Stay safe people\~!  haven‚Äôt cold since October 2019 (knock wood since I‚Äôm back work small office masks - fully vaccinated helps covid). pro mask public least colder months. Idgaf anyone else may keep wearing masks times certain places. People gross covid guidelines ensured don‚Äôt get 3-4 colds year like normal. Yeah it‚Äôs called science, primitive.

It‚Äôs perfect could long term effects don‚Äôt know risk much lower risks involved allowing kids exposed disease killed million people. Cause won‚Äôt get sweet weapons missile launchers  ....so you‚Äôve one shot, keep wearing mask you‚Äôll fine. keep living year second. Literally exactly CDC says. No. Indeed, relevant learning thing. don‚Äôt want called racist saying thing black people say whit people.  Texas removed restrictions 2 months ago cases kept going down. people actually wear masks, grocery stores whatnot, that's already pretty low risk getting infected begin (you're people prolonged periods). 


Lastly, I'd like see definitive data masks actually anything begin with. mask mandates basically ""better safe sorry"" approach, fine try, point low case numbers, minor help masks might provide far less anyway.  Open reinfection variants? getting even? get like 80% protection first shot wear mask two weeks second shot. 

I see problem TBH. Maybe? that‚Äôs problem. CDC making weird policy decisions based feel people react. Right, wrong, it‚Äôs ‚Äútrust science‚Äù moment. people cited paper matter? I'm actually research study referenced believe immunosuppressive nature SOT patients also covers Lupus cancer patients since take similar immunosuppressive drugs. Also 54% people produced sort ""detectible"" antibody level. also important since know antibody level considered ""good"" protection. lot people 54% produced low antibody levels degree protection unknown. please, tell dismissive group? way, top CDCs website new recommendations box says exactly I'm saying now: ""The effectiveness vaccines *immunocompromised* individuals unknown may offer protection time. individuals take precautions unvaccinated"". Again, dismissal quite disturbing. I'm telling people get vaccinated, especially people fall group. definitely should. people fall category still play safe reinforces fact need lot people vaccinated. sucks roses chocolate cannot let group left behind Even theoretically could package microchip diameter needle, people think they‚Äôre going power said microchip? Yes, although that's going happen own.

Someone needs break cycle bigger man. might popular opinion here, way mess scientific community steadfastly avoid taking bait playing game cynical politicians want play. politicians going frame scientific messages way appeals conservative sections public, scientists it.

That might seem fair, necessary. deaths people concerned about. long term health effects, Long Covid, I'm mostly worried about. Long term effects like loss smell taste, lung damage, brain fog, exhaustion, etc many experiencing even months infection.

If take precautions prevent outcome family, will. like world making harder keep loved ones safe they're tired wearing masks. protected I? I‚Äôm week past second moderna shot, aren‚Äôt making us wear masks work, would like go gym (I go super Early one would still wear mask). feel like I‚Äôm protected enough mask gym alone good, man, still feels wrong. I‚Äôll two weeks Thursday know I‚Äôm like fully fully fully vaccinated, enough protected shed doomsday fears maskless work, masked gym? Love answer. Yes science needs proceed caution, reality know results good.

Its really dosing point vs effectiveness long term issues. Hey, there, friend. We're 2021 now. Join us. relationship age severity symptoms 2-dose vaccines?

Anecdotally, seems like younger people symptoms older people. they're opening kids age 12 up, kids worst reaction vaccine? 

It almost seems like vaccine gives inverse symptoms compared virus itself. older people risk virus children often show symptoms all. 

I've wondering there's data support not, also I've wondering there's relationship react vaccine would reacted covid got first. 

I guess impossible discuss hypotheticals like that, information suggesting correlation? Meaning, second dose vaccine made feel sick several days, would felt extremely sick covid? opposite true? correlation all? way know? can't kids 're dead

well... technically  I'm saying dangerous. got feel perfectly fine. saying know even long term effects yet likely wont while. said, look 3 year old son ask would want give vaccine information know covid effects children, answer no. least actual concrete research information.  NY giving bunch free stuff (Shake Shack fries recent). also pick Yankees/Mets tickets, subway card, Natural History Museum, etc.  LOL get shots? remember CVS verified age not. remember told young getting 20 wear mask spread virus it. less protecting others. Even vaccination still spread virus non vaccinated people (aka. carrier), hence wearing mask. neighbors I‚Äôve literally never seen wearing masks can‚Äôt stay home longer 3 minutes said got vaccinated weeks probably eligible. mean maybe car broker stay home mom obnoxiously large America flag house tier first responders essential workers, mean... OP getting downvoted due poor risk assessment focus imaginary risk future instead real current risk Corona. 50 thousand younger 39 sound rare me. Sometimes, really hate America democracy. different would things government fully page, actually cracked people either getting vaccinated deliberately prolonging pandemic wearing masks? vaccines one best medical innovations history. something celebrate! think point unvaccinated person chooses lie wear mask cannot harm person fully vaccinated without mask. 

Believe probably thought this.  Yup, way messaging spreads people going hear mask mandated lifted. 11 year 10 month old daughter early birthday üéâ ;-)  protection first shot.

Yeah like 80% better. folks keep wearing mask couple weeks. see problems either.  Remember said masks don‚Äôt work hospitals would time buy masks?

Only commenting considering people reacted TP gasoline. totally right move, way many idiots looking fuck everyone else. remind less chance catching covid store dying car crash way there. accept risk car, willing accept risk virus? im fully vaccinated. Important factor.

But thats also go process tramua past year. collectively that, take time get point dont need work fear leaving house. feel like people understand lot diseases. I'm finishing medical school soon throughout pandemic people keep sending talking aspects COVID they're specific COVID something we've never seen before. think unvaccinated people wearing masks following guidelines anyway. trash endocrine system? think that's worth it. highly doubt people want turn guy moobs Fight Club.

On serious note, monoclonal antibodies (and steroids oxygen later work way) probably much better way go. makes think could low 10%? Genuinely wondering.  Thank much. link paywall block, I'm desktop take element... got text handy?

This quite reassuring. Hope thread asthma covid, much luck finding one place. use full stroller cover inside kid. 100% perfect vaccination rates, near 6ft anyone amount time feel like safe. 100% safe still safe.  used trust fellow Americans given rampant jackassery I‚Äôve seen last years don‚Äôt. much ideal. Fortunately summer outdoor stuff, vaccine kids 12 come soon enough.

As kids 2, yeah sucks Throwing employees, ones called essential, lions. Well they‚Äôre they‚Äôre people aren‚Äôt vaccinated mostly, see could look foolish surface People would say ""uh, thanks"" regardless. people vaccinated figure since they're already passing, bother real thing? That's kind thing though, lot idiots, especially Texas, already going around unmasked unvaccinated months now, hell, stopped gas one Exurban/Rural county back December nobody going store part wearing mask. None exist live, I'd drive 3.5 hours get Walmart. Delivery never option. Curbside never option. assume every person see businesses without mask vaccinated. 2020 killed trust American's willingness help fellow Americans. implications group people unable get vaccine actual health reasons? must scary position in. Either way, pandemic becomes endemic.


FTFY  fact Japan close breaking 7 day average death record 70M+ doses sitting baffling. think business follow suit within two weeks going need explain shareholders they're seeing massive decline business. think ""What people lie getting vaccinated?"" going satisfactory answer someone who's got millions companies. One hard science not. 

We follow hard science. 

If don‚Äôt medically NEED masks never forced wear them.  People getting vaccines months now. know people fully vaccinated two months ago. Lots them. still wear masks couple days ago. There's plenty lead this. real question: know read info that? received shots impression still catch spread, usually asymptomatic spread less due symptoms. 

I've heard mentioned comments multiple times seen trusted source yet. Would love confirmed make decisions based it.

Edit: know deleted post said way, I'm asking shed aspect mentioned comment. C'mon now, think everybody subreddit knows anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers going take opportunity go maskless without repercussions. mean, they're already awful people, think they're going reservation lying?

I agree better society honest people fully vaccinated going maskless, problem. society live in, unless vaccines become mandated (extremely unlikely) forgery-resistant way prove vaccination status (also unlikely), mask wearing continue protect vulnerable among us (children, immunocompromised) evil/stupid among us (anti-vaxxers anti-maskers). risk kid infected disease vaccine? make sense me. taking risk need take on. prevent sickness deathly some, cause serious illness hospitalization kids (MIS-C), even kids fine - so. wait another months, really much ask adult? adults emotional refuse wear mask? sensible reason wearing mask beside chicken. American Christian thing do. Remember Jesus owned libs? Hob Knobbed rich? ignored poor? yeah, neither I. heard before, however, personal experience people know tested positive remaining symptom-free. asymptomatic positives gone develop symptoms within 72 hours. anyone want guess many people really died COVID 19 globally? I'm fairly convinced people subreddit fringe variety anti vaxxers. still want take vaccine, they're convinced accomplish anything they'll still die instantly stand next infected person. zero risk society dead society.

Enjoy. Sample size one, know - much left still unvaccinated. Why?

I'm waiting Novavax and:

* wife work remotely
* meet friends open air back porches daytime, occasionally
* grocery orders curbside pickup
* even togo orders restaurants unless curbside pickup

Why novavax? turn body last stage vaccine factory.

I'm sure science behind vaccines sound - like design architecture e.g. first iPhone sound.

The second version iPhone much better, though. 3gs, finally got right 4s set quality stone. 

That's world's richest (and arguably finest consumer electronics design) company effectively infinite resources - working considerably less pressure.

While Novavax's production procedure novel - like far body sees, close ""dead virus"" tech know love get (with good efficacy). Even simpler that, fact, part virus.

That's understanding, anyway. I'm obviously doctor. 

If higher risk factor - would line others ASAP. don't, though. 

I wonder many like waiting take Novavax (or waiting see goes, can)?  Yeah forcing people get vaccine going bring host issues. end day people right choose put body, even best thing them. That's smoking still legal. You‚Äôre supposed bring birth certificate government id (like passport)... Schools avoidable. Immunocompromised kids nothing new. Exactly US opened quickly followed UK's Israel's approach. Ok well clearly bad choice mind-control-microchips :D Schools still mostly require them, although there's exemptions. What‚Äôs problem? little kids. I‚Äôm gonna wear mask likely wear feel weird. they‚Äôre don‚Äôt wear mask, eventually get vaccinated won‚Äôt wear masks go well. CDC shown reliable organization people go least restrictions suggested. Nah I‚Äôve lazy tbh Free all. 

Forcing us share private medical information restaurant hostesses movie theater ticket takers live lives normal horrifying prospect. 

We‚Äôre point enough people vaccinated you‚Äôre nervous make whatever extra steps personally feel necessary stay ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. 

Vaccine hesitant people likely haven‚Äôt cautious probably already gotten virus antibodies. 

CDC says fully vaccinated people go back normal. you‚Äôre vaccinated go back normal. Don‚Äôt need government give permission take masks science says don‚Äôt need. think looking herd mentality - groups people essentially whatever majority people do, begrudgingly, whether wearing mask getting jab. complaining bitterly ""rights"" lamenting people weak willed ""cold."" I‚Äôve also already it. Throw statistics üìä thing private business still right deny service don‚Äôt follow mask rules. 

So really basically saying don‚Äôt wear masks friends you‚Äôre vaccinated. companies like Trader Joe‚Äôs saying don‚Äôt mask store you‚Äôre vaccinated there‚Äôs that. would make sense... discussion largely remained outside public discourse, though. That's Democrats trying do. forget, there's lot corruption party. terrible children going that. breaks heart. yes, much ask everybody who's vaccinated wear mask now. spot on. parents ""special"" children usually dead inside (and fucking boring) desperately look something get attention.
My kids (under 6) almost never worn mask, played outside tons unmasked children one got sick.

I guess helps keep weaklish weirdos away. needs someone watch baby home then. done great job sorting anything far. Big corporations already shrug fines cost business. Musk fined $20 million manipulating Tesla said ""worth it."" Childcare hard get pre pandemic. it‚Äôs much harder it‚Äôs either unavailable, unreliable, unsafe. Also comments (even article) people ‚Äúnot wanting risk kids‚Äù, yes parents absolutely risking kids. Many people haven‚Äôt choice work. Especially governors taking extra $300 pandemic money feds order placate business community force people take low paid work abysmal. personally known people sent Covid positive kids school choice work. It‚Äôs really awful hard parents haven‚Äôt caught break. That‚Äôs really sad part lifting mask mandate early. Wearing mask small thing works. political statement. end they‚Äôll go OSHA state law they‚Äôre operating decides. Well, kid high fever six days lost 10% body weight catching flu, needing weeks recover full strength, would implementing becomes common courtesy least mask coughing close people.

Kids endure lot limitations limiting social contact, remote learning, risking infection school - help prevent spread protect people. - adults vaccinated kids forgotten. think would common courtesy solidarity kids wait loosening restrictions, least masking up, help, vaccine available everyone.

In theory, vaccinated still wear masks. But, practice, work. Nobody masking up. frustrating parent. know wtf talking about. kids vaccinated easily get someone vaccinated know one group people ""honest"" it, they're problem. can't compare two percentages. 

One group politically demotivated primarily lives large cities shortages start.


There probably reasons, point can't compare two stats different drivers behind them. anybody fully vaccinated *right now* choosing ""to wrong thing""?

Believe plenty good people country much want get vaccinated still waiting second shot, even first shot. fault own.

I'm 11 days getting second shot fully protected mid-June. next month, every time go shopping, get share indoor space maskless unvaccinated right-wingers, people spared horrendous fate wear freaking piece cloth face weeks.

But got yours, that's thing matters, right? care anyone problem Costco starting May 19th. like I'm wearing mask, *their* problem. masks me. see epidemiologist, would mind asked question this?

Aside variability speed achieve, difference function vaxxed vs percentage vaxxed? amateur understanding would slower, say 55% vax rest don't, remaining 45% would eventually prone catching it, ones risk groups largely recovering, we'd achieve herd immunity eventually, slower, much loss life part people chose it, like, we'd still get there.

Your comment got curious, mechanism covid makes herd immunity function like, well, herds immunities? Haha thank advance, best well informed^_^ look like people affected higher taxes going rich. Somehow right manages convince people that's going make pay taxes even they're rich. Masks work. real question whether mask mandates do. Yup everything said. I'd like challenge people making seem people logic way consider trauma might have. useful logic they're panic attack speak front classroom full people harmless spider disappeared behind bedshets? 

I know people attacking though lol. happily took shot. Here's one NIH.... many.

[Lasting Immunity COVID No, many people remain unvaccinated, covid vaccines new moderna pfizer new, also use new mRNA tech. received emergency authorization FDA. regular testing process, takes years subjects observed years. want anymore variants though...

The US spread becoming increasingly control. new variants emerge they're going come places like India Brazil. Looks like here's close 1 3 estimated, confidence intervals quite large.

http://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html would labeled communist likely baby tree sniffer. understand babies trouble masks, I've seen children young toddlers problems (like they're fidgeting taking ) wearing masks past year. agree, early CDC announcing tell must pushing media talk cause every time turned radio past couple days talked about. 2 months, it'd probably lot appropriate. 

In another thread, someone speculated CDC probably push people slow get vaccine, seems plausible, putting people risk still 50% population fully vaccinated. got 2nd shot week, it'll still take 2 weeks considered fully vaccinated. think lot easier business employees vs business customers/clients. Way harder enforce latter case. employees they're sort obligated provide employer answer whether vaccinated not. Kids lowest risk severe reaction death COVID population. vaccines even emergency approved kids.

I'm parent I'm fully vaccinated myself, parent I'd prefer leave under-12 child unvaccinated COVID. think safer choice. heck think we‚Äôve doing? I‚Äôm talking schools *unavoidable* public places. amusement parks restaurants won‚Äôt going anyway. anyone know find many total doses particular vaccine given world wide? trying find many Pfizer moderna doses given world, seem find total vaccines given without knowing type. 

(I trying show mom blood clotting side effect mRNA vaccines) Surprising one. Obviously businesses won‚Äôt enforce them, don‚Äôt want hassle should! Good luck today! This. 
My 2.5yo worn mask since beginning left took off. learned quickly problems. 

In emergency, put daycare weeks. deep phlegmy cough can‚Äôt shake 5 weeks doesn‚Äôt like go daily ‚Äúruns‚Äù around neighborhood like before. It‚Äôs heartbreaking see. would think vaccines would available elderly young first. elderly. next elderly. Etc. take care people can‚Äôt take care first. people supposed capable making intelligent decisions. 

Like antivaxxer sally reeks essential oils wearing mask restaurants laughing peoples faces every weekend poor toddler grown world masks mean ability activity can‚Äôt safe. probably best feeling I've long. smiling whole time kinda felt shameful also kept mask pocket case anyone problem. 

Is sarcasm went local clinic, birth dates file, sure verify pharmacies... days now.

I feel like there's movie this. knew that. call COVID scam flu even though half million died, yet won‚Äôt take vaccine kills nobody nanobots/no long term health data/it made cousin sick three days. makes sense except Q-anoner set deliberately ignores obvious realities. older get, weaker immune response likely be, I‚Äôve told older people generally milder reaction shots. always, though, friend‚Äôs dad who‚Äôs well senior years ass kicked soundly shots week each. really, create incentives carbon neutral energy carbon tax. Economics sort rest received vaccine small town sitting there, received first dose, disheveled woman walked mask covered dirt. woman walked nurse asked vaccine microchip it. company least, everyone open got vaccinated refused. easy enforce mask mandates based peer pressure complaints HR. office environment. I'm trying look confirmed cases per total population.... think dangerous anyone assume they've without confirmed positive test confirmed antibody test. So, admittedly skewing conservative potential percentage who've developed immunity natural way. Unfortunately, I've met lot people said something effect of.... ""oh yeah, back 2019 bad..."" well put. decision CDC endanger lives. Offering carrot without system penalize violating typical government.  antibody measure enough, even Phase 3 trials. Inject ask people stay home measure antibody levels conclude trials. kids can't make choice yet, unfortunately. lose protection adults masked around them. 
Fortunately two oldest awesome wearing masks, obviously baby can't. indoor activities summer guess. two weeks, partially naturally becomes plenty good enough [I mean really want CFR mandate never started buddy:) wear mask hospitals work at. even know mask actually works? Right, talking lockdowns massive economic consequences.  you. 6 year old 7 month old. 7 month old antibodies breastfeeding, perfect health.

There really zero risk him. Roughly 100 kids 4 died mainly comborditities.

It matter spin data. looking 100% health returns, build bubble stay home. unvaccinated, un masked, infectious person danger unvaccinated people, even wearing masks.

Time get vaccinated don‚Äôt want risk? Much less 1% eligible population aren‚Äôt able get vaccine medical reasons. everyone else, go unvaxxed unmasked get covid, fucking bad. supposed care? Yo downvote, he's right! misinformation spread previous administration we'll never hit herd immunity, we'll dealing shit years come it. impossible overstate damage done incompetent narcissists. what‚Äôs death rate vaccinated? important stat matter. 

Stop distorting numbers try fear monger. you‚Äôre scared stay home Vaccinated people likely going continue wearing masks.

Uh hello? I'm not. I'm gonna go walmart next week without mask Starbucks way might swing well without mask per CDC, science vaccines! don‚Äôt get it. also work hospitals. You‚Äôd amazed many us including doctors know mask thing bullshit. hey, know üòâ get zombie variant. it. would maintaining masks hurt businesses? Social distance restrictions haven‚Äôt changed, people wear mask not. case actually planning year last year cases people getting vaccinated. masks still place, would lot safer us get out. obviously it‚Äôs vaccinated maskless people I‚Äôm worried about, it‚Äôs maskless non-vaccinated people, unfortunately area make large amount population. nothing stop people saying vaccinated. great kids 12 rely collection health measures rather vaccines. Yeah im skeptical people refused wear masks past year first line that. said waves people paranoid about, hear millimeter waves. least penetration 5G bands, hence point. Kids die it.
 
Kids extremely unlikely become ill anything mild symptoms.
 
The CDC practically every state government forget kids exist - consciously determined risk children minimal warrant public health measures.

Trust experts. Trust science. hell live, avoid it? Ok risk death age group less .1%. you‚Äôre scared don‚Äôt take grocery store, wear mask. We‚Äôre what, like 50% vaccinated general population? pandemic try chill live life. 

source: anyone know advisable take Pfizer Moderna vaccine Indian covishield ( AstraZeneca) vaccine ? Wondering coz vaccine India, US don‚Äôt know much protection Indian vaccine give . Also seeing lot cases ppl getting COVID 2 shots Indian vaccine. 4 months since rollout started, long gonna wait? already know getting Covid high probability long term effects, there's zero reason believe vaccine causes them. problem completely irresponsible guidance issue vaccination rate nation still way low stop pandemic there's way enforce stipulation fully-vaccinated people.

What effect ""no one wears masks anymore"". *might* fine...or might lead return 8 months ago mutant different spike protein comes India. ‚ÄúPaid taxes‚Äù = governments purchased product received life-saving vaccines return. Impending doom Thank you. hope so! Wait CDC told us wear masks last year? CDC told us double mask two months ago? CDC director proclaimed couple months ago vaccinated people carry virus *don't get sick* (then later took back said)? No, lmao 55% adults fully vaccinated much higher average US Zero infections pipe dream populated areas sadly. kids, may time kids (including babies) vaccinated [points title thread]  There‚Äôs nothing much nurse could even knew recovered COVID. mean, maybe suggest take painkillers, side effects also motivate same. Yeah, gap makes sense reason analyze way. among races, Asian vs Black difference higher Democrat vs Republican. 

Honestly, main concern people can‚Äôt get vaccine want it. people definitely don‚Äôt want vaccine whatever reason, there‚Äôs nothing anyways. B/c see b/t two polls 50% Asians got vaccine yet 91% wanted vaccine, huge gap. sure data different incomplete demographic one, I‚Äôm confused since state (CA) walk sites now, state large Asian population. Hopefully changes dramatically month enforcement everyone, matter like wearing mask. businesses decide whether droo mask requirements one wear one everyone wear one. matter vaccinated? doesn‚Äôt. don‚Äôt need worry unmasked unvaccinated people. think calculation vaccination rate reached point virus spread exponentially decaying, regardless masks. What?? course investigate origin pandemic!!! It‚Äôs way learn! Industries life stake understand this. That‚Äôs there‚Äôs big investigation there‚Äôs plane crash. root cause analysus surgeon amputates wrong leg. cannot understand appeal ignorance. Please, help understand point view loss. safe assume all. even safe assume half people going vaccinated. There's going LOT individuals claim vaccinated without masks. people ruin everyone This. 20 month old. Husband fully vaccinated obviously can't be. starting hopeful taking places guess happening now....  Man traumatizing year vaxxed people keeping masks hurting anyone. People acting irrationally *inherently* bad. 

I'm gonna wearing mask volition still want courteous people can't tell I'm vaccinated looking me. shit, messaging regarding masks confused since day one. know there's already strain spread despite vaccinated.

I'm gonna wait least cases go area. imagine current vaccine campaigns push number up....hopefully like 75 percent! + Starbucks would bet everybody drops requirement within week two. much pressure now. Tell you‚Äôre privileged without telling you‚Äôre privileged lol plenty people asking healthy vaccinated adults stay lockdown. This. Mass vaccination projects black/brown communities historically awful. There‚Äôs lot reasons communities distrustful, us government medical system.

In response...those communities lacking mentioned resources, it‚Äôs like US ever wants admits past sins committed communities. cycle continues, demographics get disproportionally hurt pandemic lack education resources recover. It‚Äôs racism classism finest, again. experts recommend mask mandates lifted across board, I‚Äôm it. That‚Äôs they‚Äôve done here. There's plausible mechanism reaction, yes, still need go regulatory hoops establishing degree certainty issuing EUA. you‚Äôre vaccinated, need know maskless unvaccinated? affect you?  agree unvaccinated people wearing masks around unvaccinated people leads higher spread covid? 

Well CDC would say this. science reference 
above. 

Do agree people get covid, people die?

Well CDC would say this. science reference. 

Do agree stores allow vaccinated people wear masks....having way know actually vaccinated not...unvaccinated people stop wearing masks? 

The CDC science prove yet happened....but think common sense. reject it? not...and agree above....THEN AGREE people die this. 

But OK...you made suggestion people die it...it may actually fewer people dying overall carrot effect. can't show science that....nor CDC. Why? attempted before. idea many stores change mask policy many unvaccinated follow policy. idea many people motivated vaccinate not. put it....we see plays out. 

I'm speculating....as are....as CDC is...about outcome. see it....the carrot effect stupid. anti-vaxxers anti-maskers already getting want. wear mask Walmart. CARROT? 

We science point common sense. think go back read original comment see reference science relation what. 

My plea COMMON SENSE. think new guidance get lot people fence like dad get vaccinated. think that's part goal. I‚Äôm responsible people can‚Äôt forced get vaccinated either There‚Äôs one else trust tell take mask. I‚Äôm going CDC 100 times 100. Probably safe assume large majority folks going inside Starbucks vaccinated. saw spammed times went back watched it. 

If skipped blue link like did, it‚Äôs extremely short, extremely relevant worth time. roughly 40% pop vaccinated, we'll see 70% going maskless indoors real soon.

Cases begin rising couple weeks usual idiots saying, ""No one saw coming.""

In state, cases declined 2 months despite successful vaccine program. cases flat remove restrictions, cases go up. Uhhh that's news me. source? I'm US. Flu much milder get shot. would hardly able tell flu cold, tamiflu knocks completely. Good way get anymore business least Yes feel way too. failing good member society much anti-vaccine person. original comment stating think number black people aren‚Äôt vaccinated economic reasons significant, black people aren‚Äôt heavily vaccination sub often paints I‚Äôve referring [New York Times might little incentive, increases likelihood people get vaccinated. important. 

Wear masks whenever wherever like. Exactly this. don‚Äôt understand worry unvaccinated people? sub called every derogatory name sun everyone concerned them? Vaxxed people don‚Äôt need worry unmasked unvaccinated people. It‚Äôs simple. hard understand? removes autonomy body. government decide body *has* take. also extend food supply, access water electricity etc. know enough make sort valid statement every Doctor seen worn N95 paper cloth folks wearing COVID-19. way trust government....so fact UK trusts government Americans do. Precedent, thats scary shit.


I'm fully vaccinated believe everyone go get one, end day Tuskegee Study happened, people lied experimented without consent, died.

This vaccines opt in. Right. said understood people concerned kids. point vaccinated people worry much. ""trust experts"" siding you. sub ridiculous. that‚Äôs worst demographic comes political ideology vaccinations, yeah GOP definitely issue core.  would know who's vaccinated Yup. keep hearing things like ""one shot good enough"" complete utter BS. Let people get vaccinated enough time build antibodies full protection first. suspect lot last block people get vaccinated long death thousand cuts people hesitant moderately opposed slowly get vaccinated travel, attend things demand vaccination (like venues) get situation like needing admission many nursing in-patient rehab centers. lie following mask mandates anyway. whole lot changing anti-maskers. 

All eases masking people following rules. point time immunity levels country high. 

It calculated risk time correctly remove mask mandate point. We're never reaching 100% vaccinated anti-vaxxers never get vaccine. right time? CDC thinks right time agree. 

Anti-vaxxers still get infected care want protect keep masking distancing go get vaccine soon can. Community immunity pretty high want protect easily protect masks/distancing general decline COVID positive people around them. variant become big issue current vaccine efficiency CDC adjust guidelines. Drug companies also already working towards boosters help get ahead problem. possibility immune escape close to, not, scientific impossibility worry it? form CD8 cells across 52 different pieces spike protein covid couple/several mutations, plenty good still. % vaccinated people spread virus? looking numbers countries like UK US really high vaccination %s, infection curves taken nosedive. vaccinated people previously infected spreading virus decently, seeing nosedives. real-world data look (where variants much play), need estimate ask ""what if?"" anymore.

You think previous viruses vaccines mutate variants too, news like covid is. case one island got measles long time back, 60+ years measles everyone basically got obviously limited travel. Then, 60 years later, traveler brought measles back island everyone before, get again. think 60 years measles mutate variants? Yet immunity still worked fine. use exact measles vaccine day still works fine. There's limit much something mutate evolve. Well OB contradicting CDC guidelines, unusual. sure voted also point. Parents especially parents young kids women left behind. important reason politicians talking universal childcare UBI now. Maybe nearly disgusting vaccine passport chance happens US Yup. American conservatism strong anti-intellectual bent biting whole society ass moment. behaved like British conservatives 100% think US would much higher vaccination numbers Im everything protect next months eligible get vaccine get decent percentage vaccinated people ( 70% ish )

Sadly wonder US ever able get there.

As everybody well knows US waaay ahead terms long they've vaccines widely available. Canada really ramping big time month. day, Canada hit 50% adults getting first shot people 40 still cannot even sign up... US 46% adults day despite widespread availability now.

Now US difference like 98% people got first shot got second too. wait longer Canada. get someone first one almost guaranteed they'll come back second.

It weird see back forth. better guidelines support Canada US didn't. switched US crazy fast vaccination campaign scrambling even start. higher uptake US struggling downscale vaccine operations still trying get half country country show up. course stupid dead set multiplying, figures. Chains already lifting mandate way verify people vaccinated. tons reports people even states haven‚Äôt lifted mandate refusing wear masks businesses result CDC recommendation. know wearing mask mostly protect others, yourself, right? get something CVS I‚Äôm potentially exposed antivaxers pretending vaccinated, even though everything supposed got first dose first day eligible. It‚Äôs bullshit I‚Äôm tired hearing people antivaxer states act like everyone‚Äôs chance get fully vaccinated yet. Walmart one them. 100% agree. still people process getting vaccinated. I'm tired hearing one dose enough need wait people get full protection putting unnecessary risk. wrong stupid. least wait weeks fair everyone. read way many accounts people getting covid doses. 

Many health officials got vaccinated months ago eligibility opened state last month takes 5-6 weeks considered ""fully vaccinated"" even people got vaxxed day opened STILL considered ""fully vaccinated"".

The right approach would make announcement give people time, say vaccinated people could go without masks mid June something, immediate declaration warning. CDC got LOT things wrong throughout whole ordeal(saying masks unnecessary first, saying covid likely contracted contact, 6 ft magic bubble, acknowledging covid airborne, ect). 

I generally trust guidance, bet ass wearing N95 around February 2020 telling people necessary even though outbreak countries saying otherwise. 

They slow moving bureaucratic organization influenced politics. word proven fallible times. really blame people trusting government?  get flu shot said cold/flu season (though one stil get flu flu shot course).

The news masks don‚Äôt protect instead protect others bullshit. Certainly it‚Äôs best everyone wears mask wearer definitely gets protection.

No doctor would ever go room covid patient without mask. Even covid patient wearing mask. see vaccine hesitancy CA among random Hispanics I‚Äôve spoken to. suspect it‚Äôs religion based. Conservatives complain Waco Ruby Ridge, much recent events.

I still think they're dumb, interesting reddit treats different groups' hesitancy. One group, website trips say ""AND UNDERSTAND!"". group, website trips rush mock. weird. Enforcement either honor system proof vaccination. 

And I‚Äôm confident CDC accounted people lying honor system updated guidelines. science decision political one.

Why would political decision? makes smarter people CDC? It‚Äôs poorly worded headline. computer program predicted 80 percent accuracy COVID-19 patients would develop life-threatening complications within four days one saying can‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt. remark ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù seem requiring. friends think way I‚Äôm telling thing: ‚Äú‚Ä¶then prepare live rest life couch.‚Äù

It seems like threshold ‚Äúvery low‚Äù cases. That‚Äôs great, I‚Äôm also curious: never hit that? (Most epidemiologists think COVID-19 never fully go away likely remain seasonal mild spike every fall.) Well car crash driving kid Walmart bigger risk Covid, taking kid anyway. You‚Äôre getting downvoted agree you. I‚Äôve taken COVID seriously can, vaccinated benefit society myself; however, objective truth matter know long term effects. such, hesitant vaccinated three kids eight. I‚Äôm willing take risks myself, low may be, I‚Äôm gonna need years data give kids. data? Please link data, want take look study myself.

Here data concerning vaccination rates among government leaders ample access medical care options, public facing positions, fall groups eligible vaccines: (CNN)Democratic lawmakers chambers Congress 100% vaccination rate Covid-19, CNN survey Capitol Hill found week, significantly outpacing Republicans House Senate illustrating partisan divide pandemic.For Republicans, least 44.8% House members vaccinated least 92% senators are, CNN found. follow-up March House-wide survey interviews members, CNN confirmed 312 431 members House -- 72% 431-member body -- received Covid-19 vaccination. that, 219 House Democrats reported vaccinated. Among Republican conference, 95 212 members -- 44.8% -- said vaccinated.

Removing called ""restriction"" extremely low compliance, little incentive people Venn Diagram fall ""not-vaccinated May, 2021 U.S."" ""against mask mandates.""

I fully vaccinated, people know advised get vaccine doctors, willing wear mask way fully covers nose mouth long takes individuals. However, masks social distancing, poor compliance lower compliance now. Even unvaccinated adults kept kids, might kept kids' friends, teachers, etc. offer anecdotal evidence, I'm clearly official source. 

My nephew in-home-quarantined week playpal toddler daycare asymptomatic COVID. (Nephew ever tested negative.)

The mother playpal fully vaccinated February health worker. mother breakthrough COVID began exhibiting symptoms, playpal initially tested negative later tested positive. quarantined. playpal also tested negative days mother's first negative test. indicates *likely* transmission chain.

Forgive forceful, still best err side caution let guards down. I'm remaining cautious prior fully vaccinated Moderna month ago. Driving kids Walmart likely dangerous around people Walmart though.  Grrrrr....I think that. DeSantis might still backtrack that, harm cruise industry.

Perhaps Disney could similar voluntary program? Show us vaccination record get collectible badge? pin? Relaxing restrictions every governor's biggest political card play. People flipping Cuomo offhandedly said yet late thursday night CDC update strongly doubt wait talk state's health officials proper presser eyes him. politician would squander capital. Given state already angling mid-May return full capacity really would surprised upcoming week passes without drop mask mandates (though expect least NYC transit system maintain rules given interplay federal connections).  fair, part reason US vaccination program going well compared to...well, every large country work Trump did, pretending otherwise silly. otherwise mostly bad president, credit credit due. right points everyone calls enemy, difficult rational discussion people like that. agree getting vaccinated protects kids better wearing mask. fact made argument roommate subject freaking idea (fully vaccinated) hypothetically hanging someone unknown vaccine status kids get vaccinated. 

The problem lack options enforcement verification. Previously option taking kids places strict masks capacity limits new guidance change policies I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll able keep that. policy was, ‚Äúshow card door‚Äù would expect cheaters would also feel \*more\* comfortable, think keep 6 year old home, sucks since he‚Äôs isolated school friends year. 

If mask protected adequately I‚Äôd also okay it, n95 masks kids aren‚Äôt thing, cloth masks work protect others limiting ability asymptomatically spray germs people. you‚Äôre wearing cloth mask someone still expose you, mask isn‚Äôt going protect you. vaccine gives recipe Covid spike protein body produce turn, develop immune response to. That's ""new"" part vaccine. Otherwise, vaccines extremely well documented history keeping people alive. They're responsible living people earth human invention except maybe artificial fertilizer. No, scare compared virus completely reshaped society (at least temporarily) matter months.

Do find reasoning irrational?  Yeah sorts legitimate reason distrustful government healthcare things considered. Whether they're correct hesitancy time beside point extent. 

Hopefully family friends get shots share really safe, hesitancy slowly diminish, sorta ""chickens coming home roost"" thing. ‚ÄúWith good reason‚Äù cop out. People adults. decide trust can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs saying hate veggies good reason, reason hate kale. It‚Äôs childish political paint smeared it. People might trust police, trust stop light prevent massive accident.

‚ÄúWith good reason‚Äù needs gtfo sage phrase. It‚Äôs indignant dumb. Businesses governments follow new CDC guidelines incentivizing people get vaccinated.

How all? think checking people's vaccine confirmation door? CDC's guidance fine theory, reality means businesses drop mask rules non vaccinated people show without well. one suggesting that. Classic round-earther mentality Ok lot black people straight anti vax feel way too? don‚Äôt understand reasoning demonizing thought process one race it‚Äôs somehow ok another regards Yankees, vaccinated players could spread it. kids. Unknowingly everything right. Business get back making profits population vaccinated.       Yes, dare businesses listen CDC evidence based recommendations.  do, 2 party system stops getting anywhere close presidency, cuz everyone's either blue team red team matter running, voted libertarian 2020 feels great none countries problems pinned voted rn, sides suck. it‚Äôs rooted irrationality. vaccinated it‚Äôs significant risk. It‚Äôs kabuki theater cult like go college? Kids known super spreaders? Doesn‚Äôt data suggest way less likely carriers/spreaders virus? Saying something ""doesn't always"" pretty pointless nothing ""always"". Nothing 100% right now, even vaccines. high enough protection society reach heard immunity includes previous infection way reach immunity. 

If study counters it, feel free share. key message stress getting first dose.

You nowhere close 95% efficacy right getting shot. **You need wait 3 weeks continue social distancing measures though vaccine**. Therefore go hold all-night party 20 people weekend get first dose. **Your protection less 50/50 within first week**. Y'all voted Bernie gold medal honor, course!! Name fauci! does. areas making big deal documentation. ""You obviously kids care them.""

That literally one stupidest things anyone ever said me......ever. great day paranoid misery. Wear mask want, science longer side. rest us enjoy return normalcy. people cycling masks helmet read post. Worth getting looked chance got infection. know means? That's...odd. no, lol absolutely problem children forced show proof vaccination return school. 

Nobody carry provide papers live lives normal. 

Normal default. don‚Äôt need reason return need reason keep us it. 

Time get back normal now. Death COVID bad outcome. parent, I‚Äôm far concerned long term conditions caused COVID death. feel like often glossed over. also isn‚Äôt really true don‚Äôt shelter kids things risk car accidents. car seat laws children, including laws type seat based age/size rear face front face. minimum ages riding front seat car(in many places). laws child (under 18) start learning drive, drive independently, drive minors car. also imply crossing guards school walking bike riding routes prevent children hit cars. know actually shelter kids quite bit prevent car accident death. Maybe much flu, least flu antiviral treatments vaccine available kids. also think acknowledge part reason COVID rates among kids kids able shelter place/quarantine consistently average. kids knew spent months literally never leaving house. many adults continue going work places essential workers. Going back school much gradual. child school childcare center gets shut 7-10 days (sometimes more). happen grocery employee catches COVID? course affects adults kids. guess likely happen families means continue paying order groceries, leave kids home stay home parent caregiver need go shopping run errands, parents don‚Äôt options forced take children potentially exposing COVID. people least afford medical costs lost wages come severely sick child one mildly sick must quarantined two-weeks more. come within next 72 hours. Yup. don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm vaccinated. End story vaccination projects black/brown communities historically awful.

I know anything this. done badly?   What's unscientific suggesting care take precautions response risks less serious car crash. 

The bottom line is, wearing mask reduces (admittedly already pretty low) risk getting covid, even vaccinated. someone really mind wearing mask would like risk reduction, go it!

The question is, care? one's telling wear mask, care someone else it? seem like want smug douche. great idea! Give people something special vaccinated charges. doctors charge office visit get RX. CDC guidelines don‚Äôt overrule local laws ordinances. states cities mask mandates still place stores follow that.  Gold, silver, aluminum, steel? kind man!? Herd immunity considered unachievable US. introduction variants, percentage vaccinated goes (apparently actual equation). target percentage way reach America people don‚Äôt want it. 

I don‚Äôt know percentage top head, NY Times podcast last week. Bringing new meaning term ‚Äúglowie‚Äù False, protects both.

*""Wearing face mask may limit exposure respiratory droplets large particles may help prevent people COVID-19 spreading virus.""*

Straight FDA/CDC  think US place issues birth certificates? First all, close *nice*.

And 67% total population, including children get vaccinated? Lol. shit. won‚Äôt, probably, less social pressure protect other, society whole; masking social distancing. CDC ruling effectively means entire country going lot maskless, vaccinated not, ensuing weeks months. You‚Äôre gonna feel like took bunch Benadryl 6-hours dose. Shit hits like train. may also tired tomorrow. Don‚Äôt anything crazy played. antivaxxer said liberals made would shut up. really want one. Hahaha, yea okay Higher that.  I'm way supportive mandatory vaccination. think illegal get vaccinated.

All pointing government already bunch control bodies.  Definitely, masks way cheaper public health measures robust sick leave policies üôÉ 3 days even read shot works lol care?... I'll honest children school report card ever remember school. expect biggest hurdle dishonesty required jump age que 10.5 - 11 year olds. passing 8 year old 12 pretty sure swing around 11 12 easily...


Disclaimer theoretical spit balling may illegal worth. sure find groupd facebook / twitter / reddit tips go it. real test late fall/early winter. can't take foot gas pedal far vaccinations go highly likely less favorable conditions require greater percentage population vaccinated. conditions pretty good summer people essentially unmask get vaccinated can't effectively check, fear going take another spike hesitant crowd get program. God hope I'm wrong.

This exactly I'm predicting US. Irish government saying we'll need caution winter, despite fact may end one vaccinated countries world. even want caution, think would even case US much fewer people vaccinated. Yes like pharma companies downplayed addictive properties opioids doctors created captive market. people charge rediculous prices insulin creating covid vaccine name public health. Like ever fucking mattered start with. fully vaccinated freeing. Makes wonder run field arms wide open shit. I‚Äôm sitting airport RN unbothered. Maybe maybe give least one try. trust virus make *some* choose unvaxxed unmasked suffer consequences choices, trust vaccine keep family hospital morgue. real. I‚Äôd fine CDC said capacity restrictions still masks would meant way sense. smallest sacrifice world continue mask kids get covered. Mom fully-vaccinated immunocompromised, may protected. Dropping masks early (while many people still vaccinated) puts millions immunocompromised Americans even danger. Here's one CDC. make distinction asymptomatic pre-symptomatic, say asymptomatic transmission thing, people transmit prior may thing, though. I'm going dig deeper.  depressing many people put politics looking common good looking people health well-being too. political system movement tells deny ignore science worth part of.   Added fact systemic income inequality affect birthrate amount vaccine hesitancy thats pushed I‚Äôm going take special precautions protect kid long term effects COVID, also avoid medications less 10 years old

I mean, medication killed 600,000 Americans, yes, concerned longterm health side effects giving children.

COVID harmless. deaths proof that. know sure longterm health side effects, seems reasonable assume treating big deal proven otherwise.  Yes, bet forbid masks keep every restriction (WFH, remote schooling, less store interaction- curbside, delivery etc) get exact low flu season 

However, masks requirement everything open (pre-pandemic office capacity. Sports, concerts). bet flu still prevalent years past. 

In words, stay home much effective masks. Ya ‚ÄúCDC guidance‚Äù Lmao. Remember told people originally wear mask , etc , etc. CDC joke caused lot people die. wouldn‚Äôt surprised accelerates spread new variants start popping up. Unless youve advised get second shot vaccine.  mean, yeah?  


The problem masks work Covid well Flu, hypothetical, ""what masks?"" scenario.  
This tossing masks; really liked getting cold year. nice change pace. tRuST sCiENce really leaving millions children can‚Äôt vaccinated yet word ‚Äúpeople‚Äù ""Someday I'm gonna rich guys like better watch out!"" CDC = science

Vaccinated people need masks = fine society go maskless

The brain rot sub palpable since January jfc Experts free mask socially distance needed. sad state affairs people still afraid stuff like Tuskegee, agree completely.

Edit: agree sentiment, tell sarcastic us too! Haven‚Äôt done anything since February 2020 seriously looking forward vacation. fun!!! :) No, mandate actually extend subway system overrides local law (somewhat irrelevant since state mandated masks MTA pre-Biden). guess children save world adults want get vaxxed numbers find risk, simple math. risk kids covid less risk flu, plus kids spread covid nearly much flu. kids taking precautions something less risky before? 


It took CDC long say virus airborne?  agree. It‚Äôs going take people feel comfortable. Reddit POV 14-24 year old male, it‚Äôs reality. ideal scientific point view =/= reality. Masks another year? Business restrictions another year? Good luck.

The US even get 80% vaccinated even gave year. think mask rules may lifting smidgen early, it‚Äôs time personal responsibility ones health.

I compromise life protect people even want protected. Full stop. permanently WFH HAPPY it. portion military would useful fighting pandemic, spent 18 months fighting pandemic needs break.

**Travis C-5M Airlifts Coronavirus Aid India** C-5M, 60th Air Mobility Wing, carried oxygen cylinders regulators, N95 masks, rapid testing kits Indira Gandhi International Airport, according U.S. Transportation Command. flight first ‚Äúseveral large shipments‚Äù supplies state California U.S. Agency International Development. USAF C5-M Super Galaxies transport 440 oxygen cylinders regulators, one million N95 masks, one million COVID-19 rapid diagnostic kits. also one super lucky people. :( reason US 600,000 deaths instead 3 million half America wore masks. reason US 600,000 deaths instead 6,000 half didn't. evidence changes kid already contracted Covid it‚Äôs late. 

My stance requiring everyone wear mask indoors greatly reduces risk contracting Covid. prioritizing adults wearing piece cloth faces potential long term health consequences children. highly contagious novel virus mutates rapidly. 

It extremely likely vaccines approved ages 6 months September. Spending three months masking indoors isn‚Äôt big deal. opposite?

Immunology says without masks, cases among vaccinated people. going high amount definitely more.

Sociology psychology say removing restrictions, people willing vaccinated probably net benefit. [My even 18 hours lol Dating misanthrope sounds miserable. Covid change?! FIGHT IT! Back normal change?! FIGHT IT!  I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going that. completely agree you. 

Also, even ‚Äútypical‚Äù kids die covid. much ask people wait kids get vaccine? good thing terms pandemic control yah certainly good thing. What're is? Sounds toxic. I‚Äôd break you. Agreed. Republican politician doesn‚Äôt sounds like maniac actually uses sound logic public safety decisions? Sad feels novel now. almost inevitably pull without problem strong natural immunity. ‚ÄúPooping‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing particularly Canadian rooted border‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm curious put much importance it. Maybe relationship two countries, though. ‚ÄúCherry pick‚Äù implies I‚Äôm hunt find epidemiologists questioning CDC‚Äôs announcement.

Everything else touch covered article. know it‚Äôs long, it‚Äôs really good read. That‚Äôs idea. show picture ID vote.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vast majority 35m experienced mild less illness, seems like would make lot folks even less likely bother getting vaccinated. probably link polls lol statement entirely incorrect. Probably closer month two start see whether impact not.  It‚Äôs predicted cases, hospitalizations, death would start dropping dramatically soon looks like timing starting happen hence change. happening live. trust CDC vaccine makers didn‚Äôt rush vaccine capital‚Äôs interest. trust FDA looked studies accurately determined safe suggest getting vaccine. minute ‚Äúexperts‚Äù look data studies determine it‚Äôs time make movements back normal, decide acting fast large part country doesn‚Äôt access vaccines.

Did sum right? think so.  got CDC card jerks already selling fake ones yeah ship sailed.  toddler tumor face. Getting covid means would stop treatment would watch tumor grow. long depends severity illness. hand, foot, mouth go medicine week, year ago tumor shrunk back fully even treatment. kids experience impacts minor illness.  Well internet filled videos people asked put mask rules enforced. local heinen's enforcing masks worn walk store. PA even going drop 70% adults fully vaccinated, they're track do.  think CDC would say keep masks. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è source transmission family members fully vaxxed? challenging you, interested. actually really smart move Walmart. Target main competitor still require masks. I‚Äôm anti-masker, fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm likely go Walmart don‚Äôt to. places actively mandate vaccinations

Yeah that's never going happen country. would enforce it? Unless place employment mandates will. Short individual right thing.

It sucks many choose what's wrong selfish country sure. mask that's kinda thing america. Irrelevant, thing matters future risk covid anything else. seem tied emotion, anti science. incentive want? 1.	New Orleans city. 

2.	New Orleans fared better rest state basically entire pandemic. 

3.	Bite me. We're mere 18,000 deaths month U.S. over! Based numbers, what‚Äôs final national percentage vaccinated expect reach? It‚Äôs blanket recommendation vaccinate. It‚Äôs person situation specific. haven‚Äôt done studies patient populations yet, excluded initial trials. Patient groups tracking vaccine reactions received via polling. marked number people flare ups particular disorders persisting weeks months point. example, people RA reported go back long term meds may of, needing adjustments meds. cases, immunosuppressants used, may blunt effectiveness vaccine.

In particular case, ME/CFS POTS MCAS. already bad flare disorder prior getting vaccinated, I‚Äôm trying get managed consider it. household able remain quarantined others still, risk getting COVID extremely low. That‚Äôs going reality forever, though, husband go back in-person working distant future.

I pretty significant case disorder long time (more 15 years) got vaccine exacerbated things more, I‚Äôd probably kill myself. barely handle days. know lot people disorder community feel way. People significant risk COVID exposure getting vaccinated getting would worse, avoid waiting see studies produce recommendations going boosters such. It‚Äôs fraught time. 

It would really helpful healthy people would get vaccinated stop development mutations. mutations may mean booster vaccines, fine peoole normal immune systems, ineffective disease provoking people immune-compromised auto-immunity.   Enjoy fish bowl full liquor consumed streets French quarter 10:30 Tuesday! 

FREEDOM! Pritzker (IL) said change mandate. done yesterday. best guess Monday. Pritzker. I'll believe see it. Yep. haven‚Äôt circulating rate literal pandemic proportions last year so, though, so... first half  CDC said fully vaxxed Americans stop wearing masks. problem one tell looking someone fully vaxxed. puts businesses awkward position.

Only half New Jersey residents fully vaxxed, actually high compared lot states.

If CDC waited slightly longer (even week two) vaccine rate got higher, situation messy. Exactly this. probably dine outdoors restaurants girls wear masks indoors. possibility transmission father extremely low since fully vaccinated. trying mitigate risk eliminate completely. Here‚Äôs hoping.  God's sake, gave year lives protect vulnerable get vitriol giving more.

Yeah get either. Especially since CDC, scientists, medical people, Fauci etc saying vaccinated people drop masks get life.

Suddenly folks saying must follow science want follow science. curious thing. Arod give them? Mariner gave everybody TB.  Kn95 n95 masks protect covid, anyone reading comment. CDC information Covid, especially comes raw data. knew removing mask recommendation would lead businesses follow suit. Based vaccine data, new case data, hospitalizations, transmissibility studies, etc., CDC signaling Covid irreversible decline. way risk understated surger due data delay, risk right overstated due delay. CDC sense correct recognize reality lower averages. 

It's weird many people superiority complexes think know better CDC. ""It's early drop mandate."" Why? said so?? Seriously audacious people. idea many pathogens possible unlikely catch? Actually plenty worse covid don‚Äôt vaccines. something pandemic taught people untrustworthy idiots. words, we‚Äôre never getting magical level public vaccination safe, thing could wear masks forever, aren‚Äôt gonna do. 

They they‚Äôve always done every disease didn‚Äôt masks. get vaccinated. 

117 million people got vaccinated fully. them, 9,245 got infected suffered mild cases. That‚Äôs 1/10,000. 

Even assuming average immunocompromised person *100x* likely get virus get sick, they‚Äôre still *99%* likely to.  Well absolutely would horse, I'm sure metaphor extends, LOL! Im uncertain really know vs they‚Äôre throwing darts trying strategies. developing history questionable recommendations, like back March 2020 recommended healthy person ever wear face masks, every country recommending should. Totally reasonable. work lot kids can‚Äôt risk getting even one sick, stamp risk ground much can. I‚Äôll masking work least summer. teen, didn‚Äôt even experience sore arm. That's mostly true, however state several deaths dozens hospitalizations fully vaccinated people. Vaccines perfect. know, spreads likely see mutations. One.of may care one current vaccines. move back square one. 

My point is, seems silly undo mask mandate halfway herd immunity, another month 2 there. wearing mask takes effort. still things want do. put mask indoors. Want go eat? can. Movies? can. Sporting events? Yup. things (sports places, growing). safer way takes 0 effort another month 2? That's I'm saying. Well hit 70% vaxxing kids

Maybe example adults, lol know. Honestly. Right we're tail end significant pandemic since 1918's flu (leaving aside whole polio thing missed frequent outbreaks killing disabling kids).

I feel like gain anything drawing sort hard line sand, you? still wingnuts get vaccinated still deny virus real! I'm taking week week right now.

I like Biden's push July 4. Yes, definition (*).

Doesn't necessarily mean wrong though.

Yeah they're gonna check big FU kids 12 can't get vaccinated source 1 3 children COVID go neurological / psychiatric problems? Imagine virus could done caught it. Oh yikes. Democracy, majority rules. many, few. 

In case, projecting. basing argument tenets political system. Ontarian I'm emotionally you: want vaccine! true -- considered globally say -- really need vaccine much places do. probably sound like naive young kid but, really, West pay lip service notion ""everyone equal"" etc., global vaccine rollout case point. Hopefully sound like haranguing intention all...it's something that's mind lot recently. Thank you! appreciate guess they‚Äôd ARM based chips! ...yay? 

(Sad confetti toss)

One frustrating things entire goddamned thing it. response robust enough first month covid hit, could just...NOT bullshit. absolutely dismiss value. 

If there‚Äôs hard scientific reason force someone wear mask social distance absolutely reason wear one. 

Forcing continue zero scientific basis feel safer absurd. lot less spike proteins produced vaccine virus itself. There's big difference getting vaccinated getting sick. wish. weren‚Äôt exactly allowed enforce past year anyway. Official starbucks guidelines included making drink first get door (in essence, rewarding choice ignore company policy put everyone else risk). heavily short staffed, wanting yell customers going report us (and cause us get trouble), wasn‚Äôt worth it.

But fully admit would embarassing ejected lying get kid vaccinated. confirmed vaccinated individuals test positive spread virus unvaccinated individuals? now, nasty ass cold! 100000% better getting covid-19 least. I‚Äôm happy. congested. whatever. Bay area overtly safe major wave COVID here. person next got vaccine couple days ago protected yet considered fully vaccinated? teenager became eligible?

You unlikely give covid course. fact others taking advantage no-mask policy even anti vaxx. also know spread much asymptomatic transmission surfaces. New data, new guidelines. vaccine rate low, could trouble.

...it's functionally irrelevant hospitals.

Statistically speaking, anything worry about.

Polio literally crippling children lol. comparing it?  People dragged kicking screaming pandemic, makes sense drag people kicking screaming it.  think reason kids dying car crashes lack car seats? Anti-maskers need stop pretending like give shit science. mean HIPAA violation, business wants ask customer vax status, say go it.

The issue marginalized groups children shots yet, may hurt thr short term. Americans really ignorant. realize children can't get vaccinated rt now? realize still get covid vaccine? That‚Äôs great I‚Äôm disagreeing. Everybody assess risk.  Fact Yeah, hardly ever. Well guess find relatively soon, right? Americans vaccinated find much Covid still there. can‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt able force people share private medical information people aren‚Äôt doctors. 

So answer you‚Äôre vaccinated stop worrying you‚Äôre fine. you‚Äôre still concerned make choice take extra steps protect yourself. 

Forcing fully vaccinated people continue mask social distance longer reason unacceptable. 

Shouldn‚Äôt horrible people don‚Äôt want get vaccine don‚Äôt want wear masks already gotten virus antibodies? Vaccination mandatory comes airborne viruses pose serious threat public health. plenty laws limiting personal freedom situations personal freedom dangerous others. need stop catering selfish, whiny, excuse making traitors. know quite people irl bad reaction, it‚Äôs myth variant that? There‚Äôs none stated article. 15 percent teenagers one study long haulers. also know long term consequences COVID. Think chicken pox, reappears decades later shingles. matter. Asymptomatic transmission surface transmission exist, vanishingly small rates. Anybody vaccinated need worry getting COVID, highly unlikely pass on, severe symptoms, die. Children always basically level risk fully vaccinated adult, say low risk. unvaccinated can't hurt anybody people ill take vaccine. people afraid go house COVID, there's nothing can't get vaccinated. Vaccines available 16+ well month now, extremely easy find least last four weeks, depending location. Even waited easy, getting/about get second shot now. haven‚Äôt even started, that‚Äôs you. Mask stay home don‚Äôt feel safe. better yet walk closest CVS get vaccinated. Efficacy mRNA vaccines par J&amp;J 2 weeks first shot. J&amp;J considered fully vaccinated, practical terms, everyone chance vaccine immunity par J&amp;J PA point. believe 66% PA adults 1 shot point. Father year - right would maintaining masks hurt businesses? 


Kinda hard sit pub lunch distancing &amp; masks. masks gone distancing rules go promptly. may enjoy sitting theatre masked people do. UK trialled covid passport raves, football, live shows etc. Movie theatres example make money snacks &amp; beverages one buy masked.


Covid aireborne, distancing pointless one spewing rona confined space. Give June summer tourist trade starts &amp; hard pressed find distancing restrictions retained. 



The CDC clearly signalled end game, drop earth shattering announcements spur lazy action. US covid victory party per Biden July 4th, American public ""independence day"" Covid also. Personally trip visit family NYC planned CDC made clear end game. miss US &amp; sacrificed lot pandemic protect others.



I continued wear mask despite law saying required. asthma nurse went far offering provide letter documentation excarbate asthma. sacrificed career, wealth, social connections, familial bonds, health &amp; mental well being. protect society, community &amp; homeland risk non existant. NHS called roll sleeve &amp; AstraZeneca vaccine took it. Despite fact risk death via blood clots higher risk death covid. roll sleeve coming week second jab carries clotting risk protect others. 


The UK curently requires vaccination rates low continue part. However unless NYC decides retain mask distancing mandate wearing one. 50% eligible adults. important distinction since places count vaccination percents whole population. Orange County behind national average vaccines. science organization? Love article trying inform scientific topic incorrectly calling vaccine ""inoculation"".

I've seeing recently. coming from? journalists writing science/medical articles sloppy language? Poor Nepal, completely overshadowed India, current crisis big maybe even more. didn't. Others did, I'm going pretend it. Thank clarifying! People like give hope sub Reddit. Thank thing happen first Pfizer shot. felt zapped energy. reputable science organization. Even politicized CDC right here. waited eligible, don‚Äôt get second dose beginning June. want consider ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù, wait 2 weeks. I‚Äôve done everything book, worry picking COVID grocery store next month I‚Äôm certain antivaxxers aren‚Äôt going kind enough keep wearing mask. 

But it‚Äôs me. fucks anyone encountered barriers accessing vaccine. I‚Äôm irate.  Many states begin mid-April, mine. That's roughly 4 weeks ago, someone got day 1 getting Moderna shot, would gotten second dose. issue slow. Ok push vaccine words vaccine Doesn‚Äôt really work? ends? 

I vaccinated btw pro vaccine come anti vaxx speech. Wait, people saying curbside inconvenient?

What hell? Curbside greatest thing ever, really hope sticks around long pandemic officially corners world. Theyre months behind science, consistently

But comes school openings teachers unions, big big problems Thanks! vaccines less effective them. Nationally

As virus stop borders ? global problem, hence US also offer vaccines poor countries. California verifying age, used passport. get propaganda? Seems reasonable...no kids age 12 ever go Disney World. tell someone vaccinated not?

Ask election CDC messed up. everyone eligible vaccine everyone still wearing mask. like going auto shop. guy says ""you 99.96% chance engine totally fine, experimental oil can't prove works 100% chance destroying car, also destroy car liable it. 

Why would anyone choose get oil changed chance car developing issues + chance car fails issues small risk vs unknown risk. 

I mean me, defined risk logical choice. one hand know exactly stand idea assurance someone financial motives liability. Getting COVID still consequence hesitant crowd. 

I think CDC decision negative consequences. People debating small percentage outcomes. 

Population whole good immunity level positive message vaccines. lets people know vaccines work way get pandemics. important COVID future pandemics power vaccines. show got vaccines life return normal. 

In opinion big positive overall. COVID rates negatively trend it. continue plummet now. Breakthrough cases also happened mRNA vaccines well. Yes I'm saying? Either way, one month long enough reach full vaccination status. kid one? That‚Äôs Sneetches Beaches shit. issue permission vaccinated people unmask, issue handle public policy unvaccinated want lie it.  didn‚Äôt realize shortage flu vaccines. I‚Äôve fortunately never situation wanted one couldn‚Äôt get it. started getting 10 years ago protect parents kids. wasn‚Äôt educated important. Hopefully people get it. Flu wipe year. enough people get vaccine, knock one too. Geez, must tough worrying kids dying heart attacks Alzheimer's statistics irrelevant vaccines incredibly effective, they're still 100%, also depends variant. Posted elsewhere thread:

Some variants they're 97% effective others B.1.351 pfizer  
has shown 75% effective. 75% still good vaccine based 
 current CDC outbreak infection data, get infected 9%  
people wind serious case/hospitalization 1% die,  
75% protection looks lot less good 97%.

Even 97% level, think money casino makes pit games, house 3% edge lucrative ones. Aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall heard immunity? Vaccines required schools, except many states made exemptions religious beliefs, failing that, I'm sure find quack doctor sign letter stating child can't get vaccinated due medical reasons bucks, unfortunately pretty easy get around vax requirements children.

I show proof dog's vaccination take anywhere. Boarding, doggie day care, dog park, etc, require proof vaccination. Even 10 minute trip groomer get nails trimmed requires proof vaccination. I'm sure I'd told ""too damn bad"" tried claim religious beliefs prevented vaccinating dog. I'll never understand hold pets higher standards children. Currently everyone 12 14 16 (I forget) get vaccinated - may slow draw waiting line, speak. It‚Äôs crazy hear recommendations vaccinated I‚Äôm like ‚Äúlucky fuckers....wait, that‚Äôs (in 1 week).‚Äù republicans wanted fuckin haircuts.

Wasn't Pelosi Lightfoot caught bunch shit getting haircuts? Republicans not? It‚Äôs frustrating. don‚Äôt think need mask mandates vaccinated, CDC four tier ranking system transmission covid, handful states second lowest tier rest higher, blatantly saying ‚Äútoo bad you‚Äù. adults eligible April 15, month ago. Many people fully vaccinated that. That's Phase 2. think you-know-who deserves credit vaccine, also think it‚Äôs risky refuse take it, tell us unleashed terrible risk doubleplusbadunlongtermsafeproven vaccine American people? Look stats CDC published feel better. two young kids less 0.02% chance killed covid. So? youre vaccinated doesnt matter youre hanging indoors unvaccinated people Again, getting vaccine yourself, get people can‚Äôt get vaccinated health reasons don‚Äôt want die covid. get vaccine then. it. they're refusing get problem. They're taking risk going store curbside pickup mask mandates dropped. 


Edit: long CDC stores rules say okay will. Must nice privilege entitled That's fair. protect children. That's vaccine approved yet, know safe them. reasoning, know COVID big risk them. calculations made, recommendations. Same. I‚Äôm getting downvoted calling though lol, told keep home haven‚Äôt last year anyway. 1yo met *one* person isn‚Äôt family member, daycare teacher, doctor. One. Better Olympics right? like feeling contributing death illness others? sure ‚Äúmoral superiority ‚Äú comment meant insult comparison alternative‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs simply not.. it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm gouging eyeballs transplanted blind world. It‚Äôs wearing ‚Äúanother piece clothing‚Äù x amount hours day. Gotta show everyone tribe part of! It'd coffee though. people sub way bars restaurants would closed. Theaters comedy clubs would closed, etc. Losing things combined qualifies ""living shell life"" imo. ‚ÄúPeople like me‚Äù mean someone worn masks year, followed CDC guidelines, got vaccinated soon allowed? sound awful.

There‚Äôs always going group people still waiting second shot 2 weeks second shot matter CDC comes guidelines. No, said VACCINATED people don‚Äôt need masks. didn‚Äôt say unvaccinated people don‚Äôt. CDC concern logistics determining isn‚Äôt vaccinated, otherwise they‚Äôd commented that. kids great wearing mask see everyone else does, too. going make things extra complicated... risky. Sure, kids less likely get do, symptoms generally less severe... uncommon post-Covid multi system inflammatory disease is, still common comfortable with. That's true. I've read many cases people got really sick.

I wish people like got treatment giving people getting vaccinated. fucking disgusting selfish.

I'm sure CDC got vaccinated many months ago would NEVER implement anything like this.  Wow. serious vitriol, uncalled for. (obvious) point comparison people equal risk, doesn‚Äôt make sense demand take precautions. COVID doesn‚Äôt seem dangerous small children, I‚Äôm sure makes angry. 

For record, kid nowhere daycare (where precautions taken staff vaccinated soon could be) outdoors locations (despite living Northeast) since March 2020. working remotely, partner. take virus obligation protect kid seriously. don‚Äôt see evidence COVID dangerous him, adults get vaccinated worry less acting vector people dangerous. maybe lay personal attacks, even don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm right. well worded literally illegal wear mask vaccinated? Weren‚Äôt participants Pfizer study masked up? would effect wearing mask transmission? vast majority Americans back offices months now, almost year. vaccinated well, may wear one anyway. myself, cashiers employees. I'll see leads later on. seems pretty safe predict cases skyrocket soon, especially Fall, given 40% Americans vaccinated.  mean long term data effects different flu viruses, right? I‚Äôll interested see results vaccination rates bumping back next two weeks.  Wait. *ask* age? got word job we‚Äôll back office least 2 days week. rest optional. Sounds like perfect solution opinion. 2 days in-person collaboration team-building . rest want use days. Super happy üôè  drew conclusion statistics available bottom 10 states vaccination Republican states, top 10 Democratic states, trend continues way 50 states 1-2 small outliers. correlation political ideology vaccination rate ironclad. Many people still individuals homes not/can get vaccinated yet. approved 12+, anyone can't get all. Depending live, appointments hard get people want shot still waiting first second appointments. 

And that's talking vulnerable populations cannot get it, various underlying health reasons.

Telling anti-vaxx anti-mask crowd they're safe go out, lie, spread around irresponsible point. takes away social tools communities businesses using enforce proper behavior protects everyone, especially vulnerable populations.

I'm vaccinated. second shot week ago, I'm almost sweet home free zone. live others yet, going *harder* avoid getting sick plague-carriers let loose.  keep masks cure cancers? Gotcha. curious, educational resources? Phone died looking another source, I've got work instead Reddit now. Based failure deliver, justified dismissing claim. Definitely saw thread lol

""Wait well says cops abuse families, right, says black lesbian cops often every demographic cop, wrong.""

Like...what? people shame lol Im getting vaccine im risk covid, simply dont know possible long term side effects. scream safe want, dont need dont want  born 2009 eligible, Alberta right anyway. expected, good news! US split multiple herds. matters republican party pushing vaccinating masks. I'm expecting decline vaccine refusal fortify midterms. Liquified translucent Microchip powered paranoia, electricity needed!

PS: never thought vaccine companies technologically advanced microchips TSMC, AMD, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, etc. Could sending AZ doses reserved, focus mRNA population? guy thumbnail looks like Thing Fantastic Four!  lack belief science core right.

Which truly mind-boggling, considering they're using phones, tv's, cars every day; eat food grown via modern agriculture store refrigerators; watch weather forecast travel via plane; live big houses modern conveniences; buy things shipped halfway around world; want doctor make better get sick. could go on, fact understand literally everything made possible science truly drives crazy. mean ya ""believe science."" Already started dealing work today (I‚Äôm CA). I‚Äôm personally ready enforce anymore think CA we‚Äôre gonna wait June 15 (unless Newsom changes mind early) may felt protected everyone else wearing mask, etc. masks may required (depends local rules) layer protection gone. may feel exposed. (This hesitant, fierce anti-vaccine folks.)  They're risk riding car dying covid. effects Pfizer vaccine pregnant women studied, far seen adverse effects morthers newborns. cannot said COVID. 

If vaccine safe newborns 12 year olds, probably safe kids. Interesting. kind thought might result this, maybe pronounced effect dared hope for. Maybe, maybe recent move proactive step CDC instead last year half purely reactionary. would pleasant change.  struggle much, work Target still enforce (to best ability) mask mandate store. 40% customers choose wear mask, vaccinated, nasty us choose believe virus, care, whatever reason. hell going Corporate says, okay vaccinated people go without masks. prove/enforce situation already bad? People already lie say vaccinated aren't. aware lack data long term negative effects covid vaccine?
Are aware long term damage flu people?

I vaccinated. I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs also lack data vaccines well. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable people wary fact. authorities say it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe effective‚Äù know safe don‚Äôt long term data it? don‚Äôt. understand ‚Äúreasonably assume‚Äù reasonable assumptions scientific nature. 

Either way, decided take risk. amount vaccinated people plus people already infected going crush viral prevalence pulp within next months. risk vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated people going extremely low point. aren‚Äôt quite yet things normal July. mean articles send way would interested checking out, sure seen single thing would suggest horrific spreaders disease general well corona dare listen science! Outrageous. stopped trying find ounce logic whole debacle, really grinds gears start thinking it. Ppl need get vaccine put shit show behind us. think 50/50 chance letting dimwits congregate indoors without masks going result another big spike cases. YUP! kids haven‚Äôt inside school since March 2020. last time son in-person class, Kindergarten. 2nd grade next time does. 

This feels like slap face. Requiring indoor masking keep kids safe virus vaccinated big deal especially considering vaccine likely approved ages September. smart ones stopped going walmart durring covid. Ive heard shes HUGE Facebook mean sure, that's question. question is, assuming get covid, rate 8/100,000. referring to, probability given kid hospitalized covid. vary restrictions is, course, less 8/100,000 never that.  Good point   Cool  debate many people need immune actually enact herd immunity; I've heard 70+% range. also specific local population - total American immunization rate mean anything, percentage person's community. Masks especially effective preventing people catching Covid. They‚Äôre effective preventing people spreading it. Potential spreaders wearing masks much important strategy keeping infections low potential Covid victims wearing masks. done livestream could it. It‚Äôs called libertarian party, aren‚Äôt one two major parties don‚Äôt billions lobbying funds won‚Äôt vote Transmission outdoors unlikely, even unvaccinated. documented cases. ""but... Mah FREEDOM infect!"" second shot 2 days ago. Man, glad never got full blown covid. felt like taste covid. FUN! Thank getting vaccinated. I'm worried me.  Depends world view. Like said, it‚Äôs judgement call.

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated Pfizer. unlikely covid kill now. It‚Äôs unlikely covid put hospital. It‚Äôs also unlikely catch covid first place spread people.

The concern masks effect wearing one may unvaccinated. I‚Äôm unlikely source harm unless take masks too.

It‚Äôs entirely clear removing masks vaccinated encourage people get vaccinated. Maybe will, maybe won‚Äôt. seems likely Covid deniers declare ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù act spread vectors virus. know, ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. vaccinated, why? studies showed near enough transmittable vaccinated, main point mask stop transmitting. Don‚Äôt forget Democrats fueled fire trump charge (it‚Äôs rushed, trumps trying manipulate FDA, etc.). large swathe black people still won‚Äôt get vaccine reason. all. I'm conveying point well. concentrated urban centers. work Toronto (for example), maybe half nursing team Filipino. live 3 hours outside Toronto, it'll much lower. closely exposed 1500 people per day, half kids. mask requirement, ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù teeth (may step thousand Legos governor). 

For me, want 60% population vaccinated least one dose (we‚Äôre 40% now). 60% local adults, 60% people state. Given percentage covid survivors unvaccinated remainder I‚Äôd consider likely there‚Äôs herd immunity little covid circulating.

I‚Äôd also happy take mask local confirmed cases drop significantly. Say 2300/day recently 300. want low anecdotal evidence show local parents often getting kids tested they‚Äôre sick unless it‚Äôs severe lot cases invisible. know thought process is? genuinely afraid vaccine working, worried judged people continue wear mask? mind, think vulnerable populations left. Children teens, although magnitude risk unclear. group mentioned, can't get vaccine, incredibly small. people can't get vaccine severe anaphylactic response covid vaccine vaccines. According cdc data, found 21 cases anaphalysis 1.89 MILLION doses. gives whopping 0.001109139% people study. analysis response rates common vaccines similarly tiny. MMR example 7 cases 20 million doses. 

While might philosophically comfortable wait death risk 0 remove masks, ultimately personal responsibility come play given widespread availability vaccines. unvaccinated individuals prepared die health choices pose serious public health risk like overwhelming hospital system, ultimately that's choice. think makes sense entire society try cater people take care themselves. I'm sure yet, point starts personal health issue, public health issue.

CDC source: source: Imagine government said longer wear seatbelts. many would stop wearing?

Laws rules matter despite think. There's going large percentage normally would wear mask ""safe"" despite vaccinated. problem others might infect. together whether like not. america. darwinism mean, really change anything scientific community. Even says lab leak can't ruled out, report origins COVID19, ask ""Follow-up new evidence supplied around possible laboratory leaks"". 

I really see new thing letter offer. seems ammo politicians throw around. scientific community continue investigate origins COVID19 (natural leak) regardless letter.  Wait 100% then. rounding 99.999...% ? get vaccine. Except still lots people can't get vaxxed, plenty unvaccinated people willing go around unmasked. Many parents kids 12, people immunocompromised (and household members) seriously wondering safely navigate stores. mask protects me, mask protects you. family member who's going cancer treatment needs run pharmacy, want bring kid there, unvaccinated without mask, that's problem.  1 person died, 100%. Pretty dang close...but 100%. favor meaningfully distinctive ""huge fanboy capitalism"". 

You're actually huge fan compromise worker protections, antithetical exploitative laissez-faire Capitalism. many people know Facebook COVID vaccine trial group positive antibody least u/ml 2nd dose moderna Pfizer 8 months.  work (600 store retail chain) told us mask requirement customers vaccinated employees gone tomorrow. still put one customer requests us.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* issue CDC actually said (vaccinated people extremely low risk transmitting need masks)

But ""how make sure people actually vaccinated"" real issue anyone who's charge public semi-public space, CDC provided support this. wish taken approach Israel rolled vaccine passport system this.  really going make difference lol? like states requiring unvaccinated people wear masks checking vaccinated like five minutes happiness without freaking stuff? aren't. care.  Yeah cares you‚Äôre asymptotic. Also breakthrough case rate 0.008% give break dude realize still get covid even vaccinated. Welp. Let‚Äôs keep wearing masks forever guess.

You‚Äôre free keep wearing mask. one stop you. won‚Äôt alone. Think seasonal flu. mutates yearly, circulates opportunity develop different strains mutation. wouldn‚Äôt reproducing (and occasionally mutating) wasn‚Äôt circulating population. covid. lytic viruses. Yea, wish authors letter given thoughts theory likely.

Otherwise, they're really contributing anything already said. want go back seeing drooling masses spitting everything. immune system primary way covid inflicts damage upon covid annihilates lung tissue.

A boosted immune system nice near pandemic stopping, maybe reducing transmission small margins dangers long term damages get worse due hospitals overrun. know doctor managed get (pfizer, Astra, Jansen moderna), he's going Moscow December planning getting sputnik V People assuming CDC isn‚Äôt taking liars account. They‚Äôre stupid. vaccines good. wonder long take Disney per post meinst du?! wir trauen ja keine von diese moderne fax ger√§te! Exactly, inconsiderate people going take masks screw everything get people sick. kind wish lifted affected people aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated could ones get sick. Like would feel comfortable weren‚Äôt fully vaccinated take masks hope right. Right stuck 40k per day. think it‚Äôs fair assume number them, inevitably become infected point anyway, can‚Äôt overrun ICUs either. realize still get covid even vaccinated. difficult concept avoiding that?

What incorrect beliefs leave people tell people rules wearing masks, hear 'there rules anymore,' what's difference lying omission shitty job communicating facts, besides intent? 

That assuming people hear ""there rules anymore"".

Some might, always misunderstand anything said. Mind Florida‚Äôs COVID daily deaths projected begin rising August 19. matter? Vaccines work. unvaccinated person poses threat long vaccinated. Someone chooses get vaccine wear mask hurting one themselves.   Bear mind population Canada less population California Holy shit fast They‚Äôre saying evidence seems support does. yeah buy it. keep perspective.

You know else matter if, when? Cascadia earthquake devastate entire Pacific Northwest massive tsunami. Tens thousands die immediately millions become refugees. Seattle Portland devastated.

But might 300 years happens. we're evacuating Pacific Northwest. We're taking smart measures mitigate damage happens: teaching people coastal communities need immediately flee tsunami zone foot feel quake, building new hospitals nursing homes outside zone, creating strong building codes ensure homes heavily damaged remain standing.

Beyond that, we'll handle best comes. handle kind risks. Nothing else viable. getting vaccinated. Due age, highly unlikely die, definitely want long-term damage covid. Unfortunately, many people understand this. think either death perfectly fine. here, don‚Äôt think long time even someone invites know money went.
The board--How raise bottom line?

The board--ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëüëçüëçüëç better question is: matter? Remember difficult March 2020 shift work home, kids school, staying home, masks (later on), quarantine, distancing?

It take time get back mindset that. people may able quickly, others hesitant. traumatic year number reasons. think could happen full FDA approval schools/employers start requiring it. Actually think biggest difference two studies number people involved. study linked enough people calculating efficacy infection, hospitilisation deaths, particularly single strains, numbers low. see big confidence intervals.

For example would also take 0% number seriously, confidence intervals big. 0% protection one dose 100% 2 doses plausibly going remain true efficacy rates. Either way though numbers suggest second dose incredibly important. 


And also yeah, studies group based time getting dose also affects calculations. think studies vaccinated people caught covid yet reached full protection. Mine gone Walmart leading way guarantee days majority players drop well worldwide total worldwide daily top link  talking variety COVID vaccines Johnson Johnson? Ik u mean it‚Äôs us smart vax process complete. possible, go stores require masks, get groceries delivered, etc.... Worries me. mother cancer go stores people care. Everyone lie say they've vaccinated. Telling keep going late hours keep wearing n95s got  agree thanks man. make sense compare like things instead comparing unlike things? It‚Äôs unconstitutional. already require children enrolled school international travel, military service, etc. Also lots employers require certain vaccines, healthcare workers. CDC ones told us wear masks first place. You‚Äôre disagreeing doesn‚Äôt match opinion. follow ‚Äúthe science‚Äù scientists say something don‚Äôt like. Thats exactly said. Its.. still there..and people crying about.

Yes, last year sucked. mask mandate nothing going school. seeing friends. make life abnormal. mask. things listed coming back mask mandate, despite it. 

As fully vaccinated person well, yes, feel comfortable around people. new cdc guidelines say fully vaccinated people need wear one. problem people lie. There's way enforce it. barista Starbucks know vaccinated not. exactly makes much sense simply keep mask mandate place reach herd immunity levels, happen within couple months. great news. anyone taking care British Guyana? French Guyana probably receives vaccines mainland. view hybrid system really seems like best worlds. Shove meetings in-person collaboration one two days.

Ideally people would get choose makes sense productivity wise. Nope redneck riviera a.k.a northwest Florida, one followed rules begin with. I've never seen Walmart 100% mask wearers, even mandatory. Publix slightly higher wear rate. rules state vaccinated people go mask less, everyone lie say received vaccines. competent public health agency, which, shitty communication incidents aside, believe CDC is, considers science *and* behavior. know people going lie. course are. don‚Äôt doubt took account. Dipshit authoritarians gonna dipshit authoritarian.

If said that, every part would weird fantasy.  Honest question: isn‚Äôt still small risk associated spread virus, since there‚Äôs always chance mutation? spreads bunch children, increased chance could mutate something current vaccine wouldn‚Äôt effective against? likely, given vaccines effective known strains date? Ehh, die every day, they're like whack-a-moles. New grandmas created daily.

Whatcha mean?

Are referring county level restrictions? Costco, Trader Joe‚Äôs, Walmart (never thought I‚Äôd say that) 3 favorite stores. **If offered vaccine refuse it, own.**

We spent significant period lives locked down, vulnerable elderly stay safe time vaccine available.

Now vaccines widely available lot people, anyone offered one refuses deserve us locked behalf anymore.

We done part, take fucking jab! get sick die refused it, that‚Äôs problem, ours. doesn‚Äôt come back cover costs.  bit reckless. Besides fact blatantly misleading, even enough vaccine vaccinate earliest groups January, also, varied live? Lol it‚Äôs piece cloth Everyone except children chance get vaccinated, vaccination rates fallen dramatically past two weeks since opened everyone. can't force people take shot  is.

Because like science political.

I swear, heard group say last year.... Yeah, guess we'll wait see data looks like, kind going head last night seemed make sense inferring booster shots would probably necessary doses closely spaced together. 

If difference 95% protection versus 98% (not exact obviously) seem bad. Probably 70% people living MD restrictions remain foreseeable future though seem right. getting numbers? tracker shows 17 people. going weeks, slowly. Uh, no, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs even generalization. Many many many Americans feel look asked something even slightly inconvenient help neighbors, complain freedoms taken away. look backlash something minor wearing mask. variations virus, fact vaccinated people still spread COVID? Get spike domain antibody titers done see you‚Äôre immune system issues prevented vaccine working correctly. 
They said, might catch something else lol. patient come viral pneumonia shockingly COVID parainfluenza. covid vaccine worked downside got sick another virus believe won‚Äôt?? Immunity vaccines flu (H1N1), polio, mumps, measles etc. norm. think won‚Äôt happen covid? Wait, live US american put behind list ? neither think little different holiday trying get away everything. I'm saying it'd ruin holiday wear mask kinda reminder people assume planning getaways keep thier votes.

Are limits speech? Well quarter third Americans want jump cliff facebook meme reasons pay price it? mean anymore already.

I family part! anti mask, anti vax people two folks family died covid? give rats ass noses out/chin strap wearing mask theater probably responsible deaths? 

Oh hell naw, could care less! turn people done right thing society well year give shit refuse get vaccinated!

It's OVER! masking restriction going going GONE! Probably fourth July sooner. always today great day get free vaccine America! importantly way distinguish vaccinated 36% fully vaccinated

not mention little research done effectiveness regards variant surging many parts world Also worth pointing Black people make 13% total US population, Republicans make around 45%. *even if* true Black people hesitant white people average, population still blame country‚Äôs overall vaccine hesitancy rates. numbers, vaccine hesitancy among Republicans *way* bigger problem. numbers lessened mandating minor inconvenience wearing mask it‚Äôs worth it. There‚Äôs nothing lose. Personally would continue masking enough data say definitively risks child case. People say ""extraordinarily rare"" unless back percentage reputable source, meaningless. Agreed everything saying. isn‚Äôt way wanted happen going reach herd immunity one way another unless tough variant comes way kidding. That's case day one.

The man, whose name mentioned, bragged getting vaccine created, nothing encourage followers get it.  vaccinated person, nothing worry trust science cdc, feel free stay inside forever. call. see begrudging comment. they're saying that, removing mandates &amp; options remote work/learning everybody vaccinated would safest. makes total sense. Well disagreements!

I personally believe it‚Äôs safe assume CDC understands accounted people lie honor system. That‚Äôs opinion. 

You say opinion stance matter. 

So that‚Äôs that! Good back forth. saying since day 1.

Fuck freedoms infringe health safety others.   Imagine preemptively defending idiotic position technically correct matter. WEW LAD.

If factually wrong statements claims made dismissed. That's science works. bad you. now, people contained social shame feel incentivize pretend vaccinated. *known* plausible mechanism. say like we‚Äôve got good grasp immunology works. Two years ago, thought did‚Ä¶ turns don‚Äôt. instance, 18 months still guesses young kids get pass virus. Damn straight we‚Äôre going test vaccine giving out. Target soon Starbucks places wish done around mid june, would week youngest's second shot. need put special lactobacillus creamer. One glows brightly exposure spike protein. Anyone shedding virus could kicked start glowing. Might also come handy letting people hospital, airplane, etc :) Drink kefir, now..  = Masks protecting others infection way around - that's surgeons wear masks. unvaccinated, un masked, infectious person danger unvaccinated people, even *they* wearing masks. must fun parties actually get invited to!

I fun parties. Thanks noticing. 

Enjoy... Florida man. ;)  Plenty diseases reduced wearing masks, not?

I understand everyone offended containing droplets. 

I first became normal, seems like good habit. Maybe need rules anymore people kept it, would neat. Well said, voice reason. saying get fucked? Like vaccine hesitant inconvenienced this? weren‚Äôt going wear masks forever accommodate didn‚Äôt want get vaccine. missing? much attention-seeking drama maskholes past year. we‚Äôre dropping them? Must tough. Let anti-vax infect other, win win. least want protect themselves, can. don't, choice consequences. literally deny COVID dying breath. Canada different country U.S. 

If makes feel better, U.S. still super power stomps Canada metrics. We're less vaccine hesitant, knows why. 

You seem weirdly defensive this, going upset Canada continues vaccinate current pace longer? I'd rather hold hit herd immunity target something. better option IMO. NJ seems holding hit 70% eligible population. That's 4.7 million. know NY's is, hopefully they'll reach too. really need vaccinate children? 

If want herd immunity, yeah. understand people get pretty emotional idea vaccinating children there's lot confusing information folks deliberately spreading misinformation keep people fearful vaccines, really ~pharmaceutical conspiracy~ thing. big money treating symptoms, preventing illnesses. Thank you! will. Everyone interact elderly risk vaccinated. continue part this. Jesus comments article depressing af. That‚Äôs happens you‚Äôre fed non stop diet fear guess.  ‚ÄúTypical‚Äù kids die lots things. would've better set opening date enough buffer get everyone onboard. Like Biden wanted 4 July, right? full reopening set day, CDC could impose deadline 23 May every billboard &amp; TV channel country maybe even countdown. 'Get vaccinated 23 May ensure protected reopening 4 July.' probably would make much sense. you, highly recommend taking vitamin supplements going deprive outdoor time summer. Maybe diet getting enough, lot folks northern climates suffer deficiencies, winter blues suck twice bad low vitamin D. One week ago: ""CDC Admits Coronavirus Airborne, Transmitted 6 Feet Away""

Today: ""No Masks!"" CDC never told states lift mask mandates. percentage children long haulers? heard single child across world getting long-haul symptoms. probably incidence children dying COVID getting long-haul symptoms far tell. Nothing stopping partying anyway. people cautious going continue choose people take pandemic seriously/are tired partying ignoring restrictions one time fine, pay vaccinated? thought find sillier cause, came upon thread people vaccinated never considered country whole first place. 

Even then, logic horribly flawed. guy made enough good points, dismissed anyhow unfortunately. That's literally even remotely close happened Tuskegee experiments though.



Also John Oliver video full errors inconsistencies. Right? I'm ready Mississippi Variant. (Least vaccinated state per cap. Shocking know). perfect excuse every big chain say fuck deal blowback mask mandates. work COVID pt I'm still wearing one public. fuck 20 yard line spiking ball dancing. problem mutates new strain current vaccine protect rest us suffer morons. Cells reproduce copying DNA, splitting two. copy DNA. Sometimes makes mistake copied cell‚Äôs DNA slightly different. faulty cell called mutant.

Viruses single cells new mutants created time.

Some mutants survive better others, spreading enough picked genetic testing. notable mutant called new ‚Äòvariant‚Äô.

A variant that‚Äôs important enough studied it‚Äôs called ‚Äòstrain‚Äô.

A variant that‚Äôs dangerous way called ‚Äòvariant concern‚Äô.

There haven‚Äôt variants COVID worth called strain, although media often use term. Since unvaccinated please keep mask guidance given cdc. still able catch spread. probably without masks, masks give peace mind, go it! Live up, friend!

Until anyone hears otherwise, vaccinated folks clear. Based what? people know who‚Äôve Democrats. entire family coworkers conservative none it. I‚Äôm saying would naturally occupy attention, I‚Äôm necessarily speaking _how_ would govern restrictions he‚Äôd choose enact. thats good news.......  early teen literally sitting vaccination center shot, wait vaccine cleared children let get it. good people even distract feel prick thought Americans liked concept freedom make sure wear mask another couple weeks.

Because are. way allergic people can‚Äôt trust people won‚Äôt expose nuts. nut-free schools. want mask mandate continue everyone opportunity vaccinate. also want schools acknowledge kids need stay home &amp; give option so. Saddest part many people turned getting vaccines b/c rhetoric shaming/blaming. read news stories social media posts shaming/blaming even could even get vaccines, like January. Even 1% people U.S. immediately turned getting vaccine, that‚Äôs millions people. removes autonomy body. government decide body take.

The government also forces wear pants already control body  it‚Äôs opposite. New York City deal far stringent regulation rest state this, ultimately without much logic beyond Cuomo hating BDB. Ironic coming C.H.U.D. Anyone able get shot. people wearing masks already ones getting shot. e fully vaccinated while. still need wear mask? Focus disappointment won‚Äôt protect themselves. announcement meaningless. weren‚Äôt masking anyway. Cases still going lol. even blip since considered Neanderthal thinking. Antibody levels indicate adaptive immune response. give indication specific vaccine efficacy. Pfizer vaccine already known effacious tested phase 3 trials, authors tested immune response resulting delayed 2nd shot. make claims impact vaccine efficacy.

The preprint available yet, suspect main driver test reduced immune response delay. reduction would far impactful vaccine policy. Thanks everything do. 

Question antibodies post-infection vs post-vaccination, timing protection. (I‚Äôm reading 95% still antibodies 8 months.)

In household members Covid-19 December 2020 recovered, antibodies children protecting wait vaccine? long? hard know resources better spent vaccine development tracking patients post-recovery?  get behind. effective system built scale organizations affects can't afford violate it. awesome. waiting type stuff year. glad see life returning normal. pandemic going end one way another, whether like not. parent twins scary. Especially one high risk restrictive lung disease severe dysplasia. take anywhere currently. hyper aware sanitizing keeping mask etc. sucks knowing 3 year olds last year half really gotten house much, I'll whatever keep safe virus. problem new guidance puts way much emphasis behavior vaccinated. know ones spreading COVID; goal stop spread, focus us masking habits.

Keep raising time fossil fuel energy isn‚Äôt profitable anymore little delusional world think reason works way? 

Your line thinking incredibly hypocritical dangerous. 

Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety.

You deserve neither. might. People caught SARS years ago maintained immunity Covid-19   Let darwin games begin! No, life full risk calculations said risk. significant risk vaccinated get vaccinated. 

It‚Äôs pretty brain dead think eliminate risk death life. 

By warped logic, It‚Äôs selfish drive car. political pressure, us want incentivise getting vaccinated.

And agree them, btw. way vaccinations help perhaps even better- reducing community spread. chances getting COVID go way virus spreading lot near you.

People always seem overvalue direct protection undervaluing indirect protection. Hard no. dont know long term effects vaccines either  Lol, worst thayll happen everyone else wont work reason cried saw needle.   person whose side border

*clears throat*

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  It, along vaccination rates, likely highly localized well. expect we'll see plenty local outbreaks next years. I‚Äôve read already plans open (likely May 21), border towns asked border open many depend Mexican tourists shoppers. continue wear mask exactly point? unvaccinated residents also ditch mask wants ostracized? wish waited even month more, especially since vaccine recently became available adults. Like got mine day became eligible, crossed 2 week mark days ago, full coverage truly begins. Many able get quickly, despite strong desire get vaccine. many people fully covered infected lie vaccination status avoid wearing mask.

I understand move point, can't locked forever, etc. perfect world, would fine. since live world full entitled, selfish people, many innocents suffer. 

Long covid also scares me, many unknowns, I'm afraid bring 4 year old inside store again. started relaxing that, like brought Target last week first time since Pandemic started. I'm stay home mom, would nice take errands day again. forced keep home/only take outside places safety. wasnt. let science denial run rampant save face talked vaccine audience cheered even though think vaccines turn u gay got J J vaxx 66% effective preventing infection causes moderate severe COVID. Torres, 8th player tested positive, already COVID last year. Seven 8 asymptomatic. False positives occur. MLB tests extensively general population tested frequently MLB guaranteed we'd see asymptomatic cases. That's get vaccinated protect dying, essentially. 

I understand people worried kids, though. wanted point people worry excessively Yankees situation. Yes forcing people vaccines committing genocide. logic making wear pants public 1930s Germany Take dad get vaccinated don‚Äôt tell mom. I‚Äôm sure easier said done, may necessary. agree 100% wife vaccinated vaccine available kids. Hence article commenting on. That's anxiety part. Interesting hearing Texas. gradually getting rid masks 4+ months now.

They practically optional point already. don‚Äôt get blame populations. Vaccines taken individuals, populations. republican already taken vaccine shoulder blame ‚Äúhis kind‚Äù getting vaccine much? one ‚Äúgood ones?‚Äù 

Yes, obviously demographic trends vaccine uptake, using blame shame people, help? help mean actually getting people take vaccines moving towards herd immunity, catharsis shaming others feeling superior. people don‚Äôt want vaccine refuse costs whatever reason, ok, there‚Äôs point trying convince them. judge one reason ‚Äúmore valid‚Äù other, end day virus doesn‚Äôt care. seems deeply arrogant deem certain reasons ‚Äúvalid‚Äù others ‚Äúnot valid‚Äù don‚Äôt know entirety people‚Äôs lives. someone questions hesitant, let‚Äôs try convince non-judgemental way without screaming anti-vaxx questions concerns. Everyone right take vaccine want, shaming certainly doesn‚Äôt convince take it.   issue children could easily adverse reactions dont present adults.

It's also harder ethically try new treatment kids. f rest us, right? also right thing whole time. isolated kids even isolated rest country can‚Äôt wait months greater herd immunity pediatric vaccines. 

Don‚Äôt bother saying you‚Äôre sorry. doesn‚Äôt help, it‚Äôs obviously insincere. child could die, you‚Äôre concerned discomfort. right thing became inconvenient. stop patting back now. mean literally announced less 24 hours ago. Probably haven‚Äôt even removed mask signage.

After 12 months requiring masks ya gotta give time people‚Äôs behavior change. Let alone see news. 
[Exponential  )  right it‚Äôs great point. Vaccination public health initiative. personal health choice. get personal health benefit I‚Äôve met people think ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt die won‚Äôt get one‚Äù people shunned taking society rather giving back.  immunocompromised people taking precautions personal health long COVID find assertions CDC ‚Äúboneheaded‚Äù interesting. 

Just play along ten seconds you‚Äôre actually respected sociologist, normal sociologists believe they‚Äôre infectious disease experts? sociologists careers higher education? Would dismiss new auditing standard issued AICPA?

Would like work dismissed infectious disease expert?   think economic reasons apply black people apply poor white people sure. hand, wealth gap republicans democrats equivalent 54% vs 90% uptake among white members. definitely feel poor white people can‚Äôt afford day deal side effects. don‚Äôt feel anti-Vax people let politicization effect views getting vaccinated quite much.

Also, worth thinks economic reasons acceptable reason gotten regardless race political party. black people afraid get afraid government find acceptable excuse would tell so. can‚Äôt fault someone able miss work though. goes poor white people. endgame now, anyone get vaccine needs didn‚Äôt need doctor confirm know. 
[Exponential  ) Unfortunately illegal business ask proof vaccination Nah, want mask permanently hides acne. now, vaccine approved 6 months. get included pay extra ? Indian strain barely P1 strain still rare. Everyone thinks okay till underestimate exponential growth. know, getting potentially debilitating disease spreading loved ones. stepbrother 11 :/ painful close able get it. anti-vax dad takes places he's probably going allowed wear mask -.- vaccine interest: GOP 56%; black people 61%; discussion vaccine hesitancy start; start group least likely get vaccine. That's also point cnbc article.... things like anti-masking.... anti-vaccine.... pretending virus disappear April 2020...

instead... group pointed out... limited shooting messengers, either. it. many people deal extremes. ""We know getting COVID provides lasting immunity,"" ""You protected 2 weeks post 2nd dose!"" etc. 

CDC deal probabilities. fully vaccinated. already know even people 2-3 weeks post first dose also strong immunity levels. know large percentage people already COVID also lasting immunity. may 100% effective nothing is. 

Overall, take fully vaccinated group, partially vaccinated group, already COVID group reach large percentage population decent levels protection built in. 

It probably right time lift mask mandates vaccinated. math supporting decision. remaining people protected, factor group never get vaccinated mask group needs carrot. can't worry protecting anti-vaxers/maskers masking anyway they've mingling amongst maskless anyway. 

And people fence hopefully get push carrot go get vaccine. Yes, people getting vaccines board reopening almost year. Taking simple precautions children vaccinated common sense, like wearing seatbelt. 

. could lie say vaccinated. people interested classifying demonizing others. It‚Äôs quite sad discussion real purpose division it‚Äôs framed like that. regular flu issue kids 16. Liar.

Children dont need vaccine, hardly affected, all. CDC following science would great. 

I‚Äôm specifically calling consistently ignore it. 

Covid known airborne nearly year still millions people wiping tables made bit difference.

Remember said masks don‚Äôt work hospitals would time buy masks?

It‚Äôs honest scientific communication. killing mask mandates right now, barely half country vaccinated new variants spreading, isn‚Äôt science. It‚Äôs economic. large part Britain, scientific establishment viewed something nation proud of. right (both politicians newspapers like Daily Mail) emphasise idea *British* vaccines *British* scientific achievement. high level vaccination compared EU seen British victory vindication leaving organisation.

On side Atlantic, seems science usually framed way that's perfectly designed alienate social conservatives. appears vicious cycle right rejects scientific community scientific community rejects right, enmity becoming deeper deeper every year. *nice* I'm wrong masks rare sighting still required transit kids? One side spectrum distrusts government core principle.

The disappointed it.

Political ideology big ass factor. I'm sorry science says otherwise. course special needs, keep wearing masks avoiding crowds ordering food door etc.

But fully vaccinated people special needs move back normal life. right thing year. get lives back. Disingenous arguments. kept issues fine, devolves kinda fast. 

cnbc article pointed one political party obvious reasons. first poster response pointed one ethnic group opposite party... ignoring high vaccination rates among groups party.... bascially need see ethnic groups getting blammed aspect covid outbreak. visiting area saw like 4 masks total outside Publix, almost everyone wore one even though doubt real enforcement. like people assume one wearing masks grocery stores red areas never red area.

Now people stop wearing masks even anti-vax? one knows yet that's concern.

Listen Bill Maher fear mongering COVID right give adults maximum 95% protection. Adults vaccines STILL getting infected, get hospitalized die. Many people gotten reinfected still transmit virus. Bill Maher got reinfected fully vaccinated. shortstop Yankees got reinfected. Even sister-in-law got reinfected even though fully vaccinated. uncommon thing anymore. vaccines fully protect reinfection, hospitalization death.

Children naturally 99.992% protection hospitalization. Even got vaccine, still get reinfected. much protection need 99.992%? Getting vaccine confers children 1000x LESS protection, still protect reinfection, plus carries risk adverse reaction vaccine, including new potential allergies.

Using logic instead fear emotions, please explain children need get vaccine now? contagious variants come US.

First, contagious still somewhat debate. look Vincent Racaniello AMA linked sidebar discussion. 

Second, says variants coming *inside* US? California/NY variants anyone? comment way low rate vaccination discussed (ie somehow blamed Black community), strategies taken address hesitancy. likely racist bias influencing discussions. 

However important know groups demographics major contributors vaccine hesitancy devise strategies address it.  Right think uptake keep current levels, nothing saying indicates actually indicates that. even vaccines killing 0 percent chance  Honor system. actually vaccinated nothing worry about. 

Those think pulling fast one government, well...bless little hearts. Sure can. live Florida used pharmacy technician compounded meds. knew long term testing needed vaccine medication. felt like enough testing long term effects, wanted vaccine family still skeptical history knowledge meds. researching due diligence fact friends got covid knew time. realize working SARS vaccine long time. Realizing got completely fence. Also tired number cases staying around Florida want over, like fuck im going help drop number even one vaccine still counts. Guess what. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt matter Ummm.
How NO. late though gutting Obama's vaccine program. Ahh yes, ""but coronavirus vaccine never made!"" crowd. heard while, wonder why... believe it‚Äôs form extremely large suppository case.  Texas removed restrictions 2 months ago cases kept going down. Also, where's actual data proves masks actually anything? I'm anti-mask (better safe sorry approach), I'm seen data shows masks help either. number people vaccinated acquired natural immunity, community protection long since kicked (Texas example again), what's dangerous removing mask mandates? Lastly, people actually wear masks, grocery stores whatnot, that's already pretty low risk getting infected begin (you're people prolonged periods). gonna change much anything. Maybe I'm missing something.

Canada currently 43% one dose, polls show 80% Canadians would get vaccine.

The United States currently 46% one dose, polls show 65% would get (or already gotten) vaccine. 

This originally started asking someone thought Canada would slow administration's vaccines like countries similar levels. used U.S. comparison, polls explanation Canada different uptake rate U.S. 

Additionally, tweet shared highlights Canada still accelerating doses, U.S. similar level total population least one dose, already significantly slowed down.

The goal give explanations different experience Canada vaccine rollout. interesting points - example, Canadians age 40 still easy access vaccine, changes Monday open anyone 30+ week open anyone 18+. That's somewhat large demographic, likely slow administration while.

Does answer original question Canada likely (and already actually) different rollout countries (specifically U.S.) compare total population least one dose? saw someone /r/SubredditDrama hilariously, transparently, came cop violence race gender something lmao. ""well prove methodology right!""

I actually felt kinda bad guy... ? Well one theory target audience people lazy get far.

So suppose new guidance motivates get it. Even get Pfizer shot tomorrow, fully vaccinated 5 weeks. people really stop wearing masks entirely indoors regardless vaccination status, supposed 5 weeks?

So end, really doesn‚Äôt matter. Maybe fence still believe covid safety measures, eventually vaccinated. lot people see noble want seen way. Former antimaskers started wearing masks protect vaccine shedding. delightful.  Good find op lmfao Care elaborate?   That's pretty cool.

I'm hoping praying company eases back mask rules start making us go back office regularly next month. times I've work in-person since pandemic began, wearing mask 8 hours absolutely miserable.

I work hospital (but off-site location interact patients clinical staff), I'm pretty sure HR already everyone's vaccination records. I've got first Biontech dose Friday, arm hurts little today I'm really tired. Even slept 2h afternoon, still tired. side effects.

Anyone reaction? do. can't take hormonal pills/contraception either.  Main word ‚Äúrecorded‚Äù. sure add 15%-20% unrecorded cases. expect 70% general public get vaccinated, 44% Republicans. Maybe general public's rate higher easily manipulated, undecided voters bending peer pressure. Hopefully family go far storming Capitol threatening public officials. getting covid tell sky daddy love him... part get? virus slowed. shit ending. vaccines work. moving pandemic endemic. Kids risk.

I'm bleeding heart, mask wearing, science following liberal fyi. political opinion.  local Wal-Mart. mask back pocket case sign still up. Daughter wearing hers. sign kept mine ( fully vaccinated ) 

First time wearing mask since March 2020. strange feeling thank God science pretty inconsistent uncertain since start pandemic. Studies shown aerosols infectious far 18 ft. indoors 3' social distancing guideline. Many experts knew thing spread air since January, yet main behavioral guideline way May wash hands, spread surfaces maybe possibly air. Even many scienifically-led groups still doubting air main source spread still uncertain risks/odds getting sick. CDC shown willing political rather go strictly science. reading lines, seems early indications asymptomatic breakthrough cases shown transmission others fairly low. Even states lower rates vaccination there's much concern vaccinated cause outbreaks, makes sense. CDC limited resources, concentrate monitoring strategies attacking biggest sources continued infection, namely un-vaccinated population.  You‚Äôre right, people wearing masks vaccinated affects personally definitely something care about. Nothing weird getting worked this. Nope! newborns basically immune system they're high risk. wife got first shot 3 days born, it'll interesting find got antibodies / immunity. own, mask.

Agreed US doesn‚Äôt need shut anymore.

Requiring people wear mask shutdown. I'm fence whole mask requirement point. overall COVID numbers area low, fine. still elevated lot unvaccinated adults around, I'll bring kids businesses require masks everyone since trust unvaccinated adults wear masks.  AZ. 3/18 7day around 500. days 5/18 7day 700. despite 33k daily vax given total pop 7.5m.

Being Republican state measures lifted March-ish, cases rising since. latest change make things worse, statistical guarantee. We'll higher 1 month today. Considering many people behaved continue behave pandemic I'd fool trust public. 50 years making scientists, health care workers, politicians taking shots. 100 million people taken shot US including me, family extended family. else need? problem put kids car seats protect car accidents. get annual flu shot protect flu. Everyone wearing mask indoors best protection right it‚Äôs stopping. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Republicans hate it. No, wouldn't. 499 roughly 75%+ also preexisting conditions. like precovid like now.

And get harsh sounds think impractical sound. I'd like covid much next guy. given 35%-40% Americans vaccinated now, going back old normal means crematoria soon run full blast unvaccinated people. contradict CDC said. CDC's policy regards fully vaccinated people, epidemiologists speak mask wearing whole. They're speaking two different things. vaccinated people go unmasked, CDC's position completely sound. one wear masks, position sound. soundness reality depend unvaccinated people behave specific location. Obviously vary nationwide. neither ""science"" correct proper context. reason people remain unvaccinated keep making fun white Trump voters reality blacks Hispanics

this political discourse solves nothing except getting people killed I‚Äôm looking phone it‚Äôs applied public transit US Code section authorizes TSA well FTA (Federal Transit Admin) master agreement recipients federal grants. 

Basically TSA allowed write security directives apply transportation systems, FTA put conditions grant money. small percentage non-responders vaccine and/or immunocompromised. involved car crash

Car seats? Child specific safety device explicitly use shield children excessive risk case car crash. Beats me. others said, it‚Äôs like overnight vaccines mean absolutely nothing anymore. Common sense science sudden gone. Tips! Tell everyone come contact meet vaxed. Put social media, crop profile picture. Sort like vegan stereotype. believe call democracy problem lifting mask mandate removes social pressures anti Vax people wear masks. live area pretty high compliance, great, Vax rate pretty good too, everyone does. think anyone cares vaxxed people stopping wearing masks (I sure wear one required small children), fact easier people put kids others risk act like they're vaccinated.

I'm lucky enough kids young enough need go school friend's houses etc, age public get shots, everyone luxury. I'm doctor think 2 year old actually wear mask. never required. virus kill baby. probably even know it. I'm going maskless Costco soon statewide mandate lifted, state May 19th.  US real national ID system. know it‚Äôs primary goal vaccines, would loved prevented infection altogether. guess there‚Äôs way avoiding endemic. everyone could afford leave thier children behind get babysitter whim


You make sound soo easy think argument black Americans reason distrust vaccines past, therefore absence better information (most people low-information citizens) they‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs untrustworthy. problem, then, incurious rely bad information simply instinct govern behavior, get hesitancy resistance. 

Unfortunately lot people content operate based principle ‚ÄúWhat get today?‚Äù vaccine doesn‚Äôt satisfy immediate need, gets skipped. takes lot public education fight that, especially first impression Trump administration saying virus isn‚Äôt big deal, masks needed go work even Covid. Also remember full picture long term health consequences severe mild cases.

Some people mild childhood case polio, latter life suffered post-polio syndrome. say absolutely same. see community choose restriktions protect many. It‚Äôs good debate actions individuals harming community.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's true, also matter without noteworthy source energy space even shitty antenna. Yeah, I'm perfectly fine people want vaccine getting sick. I'm tired getting mad endangering they're risking themselves. I'll probably wear mask public settings time being, stop stuff love like playing basketball, eating restaurants friends, going gym, going concerts (I suppose wear mask this, can't distance well venues), going dates, intend slowly start reincorporating life 14 months strict isolating. mean dad won‚Äôt allow wear mask? that‚Äôs basically child abuse. case there's really nothing done. family known people like this. can't change minds. Logic penetrate. Keep good work everyone near surrounding get chance vaccine, like you. 

Respect! I'm aware current Health Region restrictions BC, well BC Ferries restrictions. commenting can't wait restrictions lifted border reopened, visit beautiful Victoria again. Ineligible people getting vaccinated going vaccine sites towards end day getting vaccine get thrown away someone show apt. know people got vaccine way. Yah covid could long term health effects. people make argument people reporting hypochondriacs would believe there's chance real. worst I've seen patients hospitalized, expected, I've also heard happen people otherwise perfectly healthy. Wow. province reach 70% vaccination certain age groups indoor household gatherings increase 10 people outside home. group hits 70% open more, Step 1 starts end May. Yea isn‚Äôt real concern take time figure a) science behind mRNA vaccines b) context developed quickly. much hate Cuomo get feeling he's actually holding bag this. Politically careers dead many Democrats hesitant remove mandates given vaccination rate. Better let catch flak briefly people rush vaccinations. state change tune quickly &amp; manuever allow residents get vaccinated easing reopening. 



NY state ready NYC ready given insane density. know CDC says time think caveats NYC, Chicago, &amp; Philadelphia. They‚Äôre putting risk. They‚Äôre putting others risk too.

Hope sink soon.  totally anecdotal plan go Costco morning May 19th state's indoor mask mandate lifted wearing mask. Shouldn‚Äôt grandma already dead? Boycotts effective, government intervention intent helping proletarian truly solve mess    Dont ridiculous. Maybe - maybe america outside get vaccine determined left right handed. thing NC. vaccinated didn‚Äôt wear mask grocery shopping, almost everyone still mask"
