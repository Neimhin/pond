0,2020-09-21," Except little Luddite communities around country like Medicine Hat. got Korean kf94 masks, legitimately enjoy wearing them. make feel safe. actually also protect infection, pretty comfy look cool. They've completely ruined regular cloth surgical masks me. check em out. Can't wait South Park episode think we're likely go war long. even gotten homeless riots yet, though might hold spring 2021. def live HB. Every time go see 1-2% people wearing masks. wearing nose chin. proven Covid remain suspended air hours well cling air pollution particles. Covid must treated airborne virus light that. need infectious dose, cumulative. able get people passing by, even though lot difficult would indoors, long time, without mask.

I would Lso like point contact tracing would unlikely capture infection contracted way. ohfuckyaspreadit.meme State gov’ts don’t infinite money might able make order large enough make company start again. Maybe large state like ny ca could alone, rest would need group states. Lol, supposed go potentially meet someone don’t even know look like see facial expression? might want consider buying larger mask. first two months much agony ears getting tugged day would get massive headache. bought L/XL masks 4 months later problem 40+ hours work plus time spend outside businesses. We're still first wave. numbers stable months...  Canada, like America better people We've discussed amongst agreed annex anything north latitude 41°41'N guarantee estonia one death past 3,5 months. guess counting covid deaths.. life expectency 78 years. What's that? risk dying 80 year old peak covid Sweden lower Estonia pre covid.  mind? even trying say, we’re going go back normal ever? know can’t possibly delusional. People wit’s end. going last forever, much r/coronavirus wishes would. also lockdowns, masks, social distancing,... flu. accepted people die. *cries American* shouldn’t fucking enforcement. sensible adults. kind actions lead people exiled society. Lol yep. There's also real prevention it. Constantly transit get somebody mask asking sit right next there's another dude mask hacking lung behind me. like expect driver removing people tho There's obligation wear public. designated areas public transport. 

There see everyone wearing mask. Wave occurs hits HIT level itll turn regionality. Madrid 100k confirmed cases right now. sort negligible immunity. higher density areas youre going need higher levels HIT around 20% mark. start seeing reductions around 15% Supposed to, heard start yet big trial. supposed start month funny part you’re dense stubborn faced someone pointing comment might intended meaning, argue call people trolls instead correcting misconception.

Edit: even fun conversation someone else! considered trolling enjoy seeing wrap knots trying desperately play sides here?  Someone came work work supplies us 2 disposables per day gave use 3-9 washable cloth masks depending f/t p/t. Immediately like ""what doing?"" lol. went go reusable on. clearly get much think people going back normal life. People going back normal, they've got fatigue following procedure.  brother got angry cut fan baseball game mask on. Oceans apart, yet we’re seeing patterns. 

Some people scream rights sense responsibility communities, others seem want economically devastating lockdowns matter many people lose jobs. 

It seems need everyone personal part (wear masks, mind distance, limit lengthy indoor interactions, etc.) government provide structure (business es open capacity set relation outbreaks) support (business individuals supported capacity must tightened conserve hospital resources). 

Easier said done, know. No. excess deaths far past pretty finalized it’s still showing weren’t any. 13% population believing still way much. experience working Barista, 13% usually masks vehemently them. people come order knowing law knowing ask put mask on. feels like they're looking cause scene. discussion herd immunity. people absolutely zero opportunity countries 6 months, likely last another 6months zero opportunity meet people, find partner, make friends etc.

How wearing mask cause that? Everything reopen Colorado - people dating, people stating new jobs, people getting married. mask on. Yeah planning driving Banff year buddy pushed next year he’s risk went cottage instead. I’ve never tried winter camping either might give go year too! Good luck yours! us could also take Canada tomorrow wanted lol

Literally military power NEED us. depend Canada nothing still turn noses Americans. impossible get doctor get test? correct, sorry that.

Was thinking getting actual death statistics finding excess deaths, never thought would page. Canadians could teach southern neighbors thing two. gee almost like economy nothing general population massive amount wealth hoarding super rich. Massachusetts, violation Social Host Law result $2,000 fine and/or one year prison. Underage drinking joke.

Seems like they're getting hit underage drinking , covid. Whatever use guess. It’s really hard say what’s going happen second wave, since people don’t seem follow guidelines. Barely people wearing masks public transport grocery stores, social distancing since maybe late April. might gotten second wave never got first one. Counts definitely off. city officials claiming got 25% people antibodies, number cases official record barely percent area population. doesn't? [I’m guessing they’re referring these, I’ve seen know that's ridiculous, right? Gotta french Scott.  long people breathing air virus passed, we're going stuck here.

No no. Expect return normality quickly, especially vaccine. need eradication return normality Better what’s happening US beat it, fucked reopening. Yeah maybe live.. I, too, live in.....patooey!......Texas. third world country many ways. Everything underfunded. Look Japan 
I hope majority us outnumber minority get thing control. right thing. Wash hands. Physical distance. Wear mask enclosed public space. Stay home sick. Really that's do! Thx response\~you might first person ever expressed understanding acknowledgment re: specific thing, although really something talk often anyway lol. illusions US problems, countries going touted bastions progressive tolerance bad experiences might sting hit harder. [Nice. rock something similar think winter pure hell observer effect news *shakes people* enough protect others.

Pun? unfortunate phrasing?

;) would umm ya know, joke? can’t stop flights people absolutely need able move across country commercial flights still carry cargo. regular people weren’t flying. look airlines financial standing time know people weren’t flying. 

In many places people couldn’t leave homes unless shopping going trails parks. every state locked many did. ohio couldn’t anything March April. Everyone stayed home.

So really didn’t happen lot states wanted happen national guard deliveries frankly sure would helped considering potential even spread since national guardsmen would going house house one infected guardsmen could infect entire neighborhoods. According [this 241 last 24 hours.

Considering virus roughly 2% lethality, number line amount cases country seeing lately. Great! Lets turn affordable housing apartments please. canadian bc here, people take political statement, isnt, honestly assume youre wearing mask places require trying ""make statement"" mask wearers.

but time, ive forgotten mask twice still went store doesnt require it, blanket judge people are/not wearing one, also low number cases live (i mean like less 10 active cases time consistantly)

 youre wearing mask assume empathy incontact/live someone could die covid. that's wear one part, dont wanna guy give 70 year old dude COPD work with. 

my fiance works retail, feels extremely rude disrespectful wear mask store dont choice, work potentially risking exposure people mad pandemic seem extra mean places stay open. told people intentionally wiped hands counters wiped spite, always step closer tries distance.

it really isnt political issue people like try make one, really empathy issue also known give people false sense security.

I always wondered claim - seems counter-intuitive.

Frankly, think might excuse, change positions mask wearing.

IMHO, would better stick facts, simply say learned more, discouraging mask wearing preserve supplies. realize difficult successful people this, would better long run.

I think spreading virus problem play strengths science. many variables - can't study well lab. Fortunately development vaccines play strengths. Good choice. It’s leanings clear enough it’s rational well presented.

I used content let CNN burble away background get “low quality somewhat real time” mainstream news way, since 2016 nonstop one-note shrill trump bashing organ induces kind anxiety audible distance. can’t stand more. Insufferable caring others rather myself? 


I think referring yourself. Exactly point. America country. business. people part it. People stuck india us. India reporting 100k cases day france reporting 4.5k.
Meanwhile places like Czech republic 3k Brazil massive undercount since time positivity rate 22% think along mexico worry; State legislature Tavern League fuck again. Wisconsin's new motto? Money Everything. Sitting six feet away others enclosed space, isn’t really safe circumstances. exception would everyone properly wore n95s, otherwise, nope. like fucking impossible get test unless told doctor. Young people absolutely zero opportunity countries 6 months, likely last another 6months zero opportunity meet people, find partner, make friends etc. propose find partner start family social distancing mask wearing? Mask wearing symptomatic yes, symptoms. country this. We're still first. i've experienced local US embassy visa interview 20 years ago. lol I've it. Tens thousands others well. We're well way.

By summer we'll full year Phase 3 data. US entered war without fabrications entire existence. I'm talking way back. never attacked directly except circumstances either helped engineer standing aside allowing happen order engineer public support war. Oops, forgot say interview! Ironically sleep enough. Edited in. dunno Trump sleeps though, late night tweets. circlejerk continues county Marin include SQ cases count everyone else including state does.

This county site see 4k cases records county say 6k+. SQ count also keeping county Tier 1, even though numbers outside SQ well within Tier 3. Strongly agree. Obesity promoted ""healthy"". Covid-19 indeed deadlier among obese population, said many diseases.

Not trying downplay severity Covid-19, rather highlight severity obesity. moved 'so what?' watch fail understanding implied meaning again?

The irony. Troll better. probably since flu vaccine still kills 60,000 year happens, maybe stay home ? unecessary risk take masks proven effective. Swedes great social distancing wore masks could probably go back normal now. shallowest sense, yes. larger supply, also larger demand. Canada meeting demand tests better US. love Canada, every country dipshits. people wishing limit exposure protecting eyes

[Elvex . . [Pyramex . . [Sunnie Shield](http://www.sunnieusa.com/) acting like bad thing happen getting covid death. There's growing evidence cause long term/permanent lung heart damage large amount people - even asymptomatic cases. International press party blamed here. Many people criticized articles claims, mass downvoted Swedes campaigning here. Would [this count?  disgusting human need wish death someone? So, life expectancy Estonia 77.6 years. Sweden it’s 82.3. 

That’s 4.7 years negative difference average everyone Estonia. around 1.33 billion inhabitants. equivalent 6.25 million life years lost, translated full lives, 80 000 lives society preventing lived. 

Not great. lot five deaths. aren’t giving attention?


Number exercise say: national population level, 5 deaths basically nothing. 5 tragedies yes, people die time.  watch fail understanding implied meaning again? thanks. hard enough first time around. kidding. wanted say like Canada crazy Covid-related aggression. :( Reinfection proven based genetic divergence though.

If second infection genetic twin first, that's provably reinfection opposed flare-up.

It's also significant vaccines intended protect known strains because, far know, use spike protein infect cells. insurmountable develop vaccines address known variants — definitely compounding factor. fact different strains neutral bad news, good terms ensuring herd immunity. Science math need bigger priorities

All subjects treated equal. STEM important humanities. complement one another. think tobbelobbe69's link makes better case.

65+ pretty similar Denmark, Finland Sweden, around 20%. Norway bit lower reason (16,9%). 2018 figures wiki demographics pages.

And think life expectancy much anything topic estimate people living now. I’ve seen mixed studies dangers virus surfaces, almost everything says it’s safe 72 hours. kids leave candy alone 72 hours it’s wiped Lysol wipes. Parents buy extra bag candy advance give kids wait. 

Or don’t want touch candy given, parents bring bag candy drop piece kids’ bags walk house. 

I agree everything year, let kids go trick treating safety measures. won’t able celebrate Christmas thanksgiving, let holidays can. yes, occur significant amount whole hydroxychlorquine thing deeply fishy. Face shields without mask next useless. Especially interior environments one wearing masks around you. 

I seen plenty people, including politicians wear face shields. guess lot think part job show face. 

Some world leaders thing inability stop shaking hands back March. Silly kids. lucky several use gardening. Double layer, filter, everything. ended using right kind beginning. lucky. I’ll always keep masks emergency supply bag on. are, aren't. city one main commercial landlords £140M inherited portfolio city yet nickel diming tenant businesses exclude discount/cashflow period even 3 months added end contract actual small businesses actually employ people shutter walk away chasing courts lost future earnings would showing flexibility. That's guy yacht glad got back!

Most commercial property small hard grafter, number employees pretty minimal. I'm surprised hear one main Skytrain lines wearing masks. 

When read previous comment 100% proper mask usage Canada line, realize meant ""70-80% people train wearing masks, 100% people wearing right way"" took month enroll 15,000 subjects, couple weeks studying safety vaccine could make difference. I'm saying bad air cleared week ago, arguing this? what? life long handicaps countries want prevent hospitals collapse?  work. know already...it’s well works long might work... Quit posting doom articles weird publishers look like Russian bots wrote them. Someone needs start mass producing ""Make America Great Again"" masks advertising Fox News way piss libs. small operations etsy seem this, think make millions.

They'd make fuckload money hugely increase mask-wearing. least lying People handle objects picked someone else time. outside, physically distant, wearing masks, using sanitizer... Sounds pretty low risk. Although, I'm comparing low-risk approved activities, like playing park dog park. Tbh, done almost nothing since March; nothing group outdoors find extremely easy activity make low risk. Maybe past experience city/neighborhood. fake fans booing Carson rough 😂 important point right Whether someone thinks NASA hired Stanley Kubrick fake moon landing little bearing world beyond person. case pandemic [...] conspiratorial thinking disturbing consequences. Wtf talking - exclusively got around cabs wearing mask. opposed rone riddled tube,bus etc. seems make sense Yeah, got like 4 blocks house turn around get it. Fucking sucked. it! Love AB US huge country. NY never second wave, wave much earlier AZ (and states), look stats US look like two separate waves. AZ similarly one wave.

NY done first wave months. Gov: ""You're Raytheon's kid? make stuff kills brown people side world?""

OP: ""Uhhh, hmmm. Let's see... sharpen lawn darts dip rat poison?""

Gov: ""Brilliant! Loan forgiven!"" Fuck university profs doom gloom, big attention seekers sources pls, cant say ""its science"" Let’s honest, unlikely would vaccine Election Day even without tougher standards. No, record (blowing away previous tecird twice) spare air days, bad air quite.

Why arguing this? weird psychological thing getting pretending record bad air? narrative? narrative? Well, Denmark ""front loaded"" measures seeing wave that's already reached daily new infections first peak - Sweden, even. Higher spread, check, fear much higher death count soon follow.

I guess Denmark learn much virus, protect it, make TTI strategies, et cetera. Probably sprinting marathon. true. 

Young adults (and young) blame. government share sure, end individuals actions. I'm sick watching people mask chin nose. Republicans able interfere election impunity, knowing SCOTUS enable them?

No one interfere election impunity. Stop dramatic.

If Trump could guarantee re-election, crew scared now. Whoosh incoming Tsunamis closures entertainment, travel hospitality industry incoming. 



Not mention, retail, commercial real estate many industrial/factory sectors deal consumer spending. see lot people running buy bunch cars, right now. Hardly. done once, justice removed, possible. would legal method removing someone biased serve. So, 189 countries? millions people grossest conditions seen past 150 years disperse world roughly one time... wearing mask equal social living? (Assuming rely reading lips communicate.) Ya cases classified influenza (we didnt know covid existed), influenza cases deaths past flu season. went doctors twice, even test influenza, told it. experience, I'm sure many people thing happen them.  useless statement. really nothing contribute negativism? They're entirely correct truthful... role transition power.

However, Trump refuses leave, transition more, threat. *(No guarantee know what's going happen). politicians, business too. example, NFL fined coaches combined million dollars wearing masks (when they're regularly tested subjected guidelines). Yet, still letting fans legal. know 100 days zero cases, right. even island thousands quarantined arrivals week citizens return.

NZ gold standard. - moment - decent government citizens (for part) put dying liberty.

The reason NZ done well cultural political. reason US could never done well cultural political. island small part real issue. UK small island fucked. got bit spit last night fighting COVID positive junkie.

I swear end catching good PPE since March I’ll lose it. science, everyone looking vaccine bring country's healthcare system collapse wondering ones still get survive lifelong handicaps Bro, commenter one post right. spam bad news COVID across multiple subs.

Look post history. Relax Nope, reject white supremacists. mostly meant jest, mean, guys could get least get professional sports team sweeten offer. get every figure using statistics Vet school converted labs process thousands tests day. done since March 4th Cornell announced closing due covid-19. currently buildings reassessed filtering could new filtration systems installed. Staff works areas deemed high risk provided face shields/gloves/N95 masks. 

It also important note students caused initial outbreak due partying shamed end peers. mostly many Cornell students also come NJ NYC, many lost loved ones pandemic. 

Currently well Ithaca community. However, locals opposed Cornell's reopening, Ithaca dependant Cornell believe motivation Cornell bring back students support local community best ability well. unfortunate federal government provided relief states therefore forcing communities make decisions proposes higher risk. SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, proofreading enzymes keep mutation rate much lower influenza like viruses. Taking size virus well, flu viruses mutate 4 times much SARS-CoV-2. doubt need numerous vaccines year. many mask slackers nullify effort. Avoiding medical care nothing Covid. it'll cost arm leg paycheck even get side eye Doctor. Maybe I'm minority, vast, vast majority people area wearing masks indoors. 98-99% people right thing, I'm gonna stress much dude doesn't. impact? one thing say take November December, March April shown effective? still take it? That's straight anti vaxxer shit, there's enough people like ""not impact"". Ditto appreciation.  Oh, aware all. wrote yesterday several comments blaming situation people government (and getting downvoted too). know family lives tell everyone basically acting virus disappeared.

My complain shitty way counting Spain is. way knowing pandemic going numbers badly managed. Guess CDC put back guideline Coronavirus airborne again. 🤣😫 same, son get mean. examples nothing family size. bring wife kids prison, job construction site.  Thanks, would've taken much time dig 80+ figure separate sources. want tourism $$$ probability maths could show smaller groups lower odds risk. smooth progression there's number that's suddenly less risky unless based overcrowding physical size condition. varies specific meeting location. one-limit fits all.

3 people telephone booth high risk. 100 people football stadium low risk. Make ""outside"" mask-mandatory space. nothing ""free money"". pay taxes entire working lives feds they'll backs century events devastate lives. Disaster relief handout, something we're entitled citizens nation. import distinction we've got large number people terrified giving ""the wrong kind people"" handouts. It’s easy become overly critical people’s choices without proper background context, arranging long bus trip 41 old retired people September 2020 seems like really really stupid idea. 

31 catching virus 41 must kind record. country even decided mask work not. hundred thousand deaths away civic duty. Sucks work office thought 3m half face respirator, 6502QL p100 filters, exhale valve filtering bad. Im concern health, everyone else, especially people using masks fuck. pret? /s like canadians, seem swell People ✌️ impossible stomp out, we're never going stomp out, let's disregard basic civil liberties pursuit something that's never going happen.

At point aim keeping control restrictions daily life possible we've built herd immunity, either vaccination infection. lax. Wayyyyy lax. marlins went fucking strip club early weeks later bunch cardinals went casino! perfect storm indeed Good. Safer standards better. Big man talking shit virus internet Please reach need help navigating trying times. Completely free. National Helpline – 1-800-662-HELP National Helpline free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral information service (in English Spanish) individuals families facing mental and/or substance use fact Fauci outright lied efficacy mask also **not help.** 

I can't one still remembers that. idea, kind nuts me! get ALMOST every argument. understand push re-open schools, understand push allow bigger parties, indoor events, sports leagues return normal. Whether agree decision completely understand people would push things (even argument ""bars essential"" bar owner staff, means closing difficult decision, even right one).

I now, ever understand people push back fervent wearing mask. harmful health, mild inconvenience best times. Even masks showed reduction deaths 1%, I'd still say ""fuck it, yeah, let's keep wearing masks"". course infection kill someone also cause long term damage, however say occurs significant amount fearmongering pseudoscience  feel like long candy wrapped different groceries, right? mean candy wrappers, unwrap kids (and parents COUGH) eat what's inside touched wrapper, ok? kids usually wear masks halloween anyway.

I just..feel like kids really NEED one ya know? There's things done! Also, thought touch big issue necessarily, close contact? Thank you, Canada. mind, everything him. COVID spreads strangely, uniquely easy stop. I'm making numbers here, might 50% transmissions come super-spreading events - stop way there. still really understand this, quality reading.

Watching minor symptoms staying home also likely stop least 50% transmissions. outright data this, places strongly encourage (Sweden) done well. studies % people asymptomatic seem give wildly divergent results depending hard look symptoms. could well around 50% people symptoms minor recently would ignored - stop ignoring them, isolation easy. Canadians civically minded too, what's point? They're way better Americans probably every day. **31 41 people tested positive coronavirus bus trip pensioners southern Norway.**

Sandnes' municipal chief physician Hans Petter Torvik emphasizes increase infection throughout region.

He states infection linked labor immigration private companies.

\- far good control transmission routes. special today received phone call Helse Førde woman Sandens admitted hospital, says Torvik.

&amp;#x200B;

**The infection tracking shows bus pensioners trip southern Norway returned Stavanger yesterday.**

**Of 41 people bus, 31 tested positive.**

&amp;#x200B;

The infected distributed follows:

15 Stavanger

6 Sola

5 Sandnes

4 Randaberg

1 Hå

And outside region.

&amp;#x200B;

Mayor Stavanger Kari Nessa Nordtun (Labor Party) confirms VG 31 people infected, 29 first reported.

\- Exactly quickly identified. bus informed person admitted tested positive, says municipal chief physician Torvik.

The bus redirected everyone tested. Everyone quarantine.

\- good control infected, says Torvik states great danger spread infection.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expecting clusters**

Mayor Stavanger Kari Nessa Nordtun (Labor Party) states bus trip arranged company.

\- know infection got bus first place?

\- premature phase infection tracking able say anything it. also certain find out, says Nessa Nordtun VG.

All infected followed municipal health service. infected Stavanger mild symptoms, mayor emphasizes still early process.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nessa Nordtun states municipality expects local clusters.**

\- Ever since March, region absolutely fantastic. Therefore, low infection rates compared large cities. put test again. infection region spread quickly, says mayor Stavanger Kari Nessa Nordtun (Labor).

&amp;#x200B;

If happens, affect entire region, warns.

\- means press big button. want this, says.

She states Stavanger infection cluster linked private event.

The municipality control clusters therefore currently consider local measures. think 1-2 cities state speak entire state? happens well. understand idea behind electoral college, know well working todays time. Yes Rhode Island Texas states represented equally, people different parts states? VA live, southwest region different, need direction northern va... yet 2-3 counties essentially determine entire states electoral college votes. end, lot Americans feel unheard disenfranchised. Especially elections hang votes 1-2 states directly 1-2 regions states. Going 2 - 4 surge, zero anything absolutely surge. reason went back partial lockdown. zero cases, free clear (subject new cases coming overseas). cases, situation without close management turn thousands cases. Yup, science denying republican. Sweet. Yes wearing correctly mandatory get fined. Hell yes, congrats friend. chew gum smell stank ass breath. Good riddance! anybody seriously believe couple weeks make much difference safety? Late October vs mid November kind thing. It’s clear timing election lot decision like Canadian here, hospital CEO's, run not-for-profit organizations, publically funded privately owned. adminstrative funding come provincial government (i.e. taxpayers) hospitals kept accountable spend public's money. far tell CEO's job private fundraising rich donors afford renovations expansions. Disneyland isn’t even open....it’s closed since March Ventura...everything open there. mean everything see people masks though Reported incivil comment. Strategy important one?

Corona taken seriously. vein weaponized smallpox either, people seem acting like is. Oh god definitely. STUPID! Like wear in...just...keep on?!? know fast type, me, really spend much time.

Also personally believe calling people complaining something literally saving 1000s Canadian lives good use tiny amount time spent commenting.

What clearly time intensive commenting? envy solitary lifestyle. Anyone else enjoying half assed approach mods ? seem happily allow misinformation lockdown fetishists. routinely remove comments challenging comments. *Out window go!* Yes, would, unless reason black neighborhoods unusually high proportion non-black caregivers, teachers, etc.

The study cited actually specifically showed African infants raised Ethiopia (majority same-race) statistically significant bias Caucasians, Africans raised Israel (majority other-race) not.

What I'm concerned half assed vaccine effort. Like antibiotic resistance, gets fucked up, might actually encourage viral evolution. We're #1! We're #1!! /AR. haven’t evolved since then! view human progress straight arrow pointing towards moral justice, study history it’s humans playing roles shitty things again.

Death disease part human experience. ever fully defeat it, won’t human anymore. Lots people died, lots people die, we’ll sad it’s people personally knew, we’ll indifferent it’s numbers spreadsheet. Whoever’s left pandemic ends shrug revert natural state — say, socializing gathering large crowds without masks, we’ve done thousands years, even though means people die.

But little common sense. Even think viral videos, example, youtube video going get million views faster starts 20 ppl sharing it? 5000 ppl sharing it? Still gonna take long time get everyone needs wants it. Certainly happen within weeks. Waco Texas Say Hail Mary’s way Americans believe Corona virus real someone know get sick. worried tbh. Denmark never reach Sweden's massive death count ref. points much better treatment options preparedness, fact spread mostly among young people Denmark (and also currently picking Sweden).

The inconvent truth (for guys) Sweden failed hard. sooner come terms that, easier you. Living lies much good long run, wish best! Governor Doomsday DeSantis death cult strikes again! flu virus cause mutate due vaccine trying kill off. Covid doesn’t yet, that’s mutations slow. must one largest polls ever. like 19 million people polled. treasure hunt idea riddles awesome idea! That's going fun him! u look south korea know restaurants bars cause explosion cases. contact tracing gonna miss strangers giving strangers. call false positivity rate opinions reopening? that's we're talking specifically here.  call reopening even total confidence numbers. think bit broad rationalizations way. million health care workers

Not really.  people actually run numbers people receive report them. Healthcare workers otherwise occupied. like ways obscure number comorbidities. Meanwhile americans say “its unconstitutional”. Pretty sure constitution doesnt mentions masks pandemic one end ambulance faulty test fake news? AFAIK immediately go hospital test positive. may naive think people *pretty* sick call ambulance. sentence hurts head were. Cardinals arguably derailed season massive spread play double headers. likely still make playoffs lower seed. teams got smarter preventing covid though credit that. 5% population? really need get think low, armchair statistician. Where'd graduate from? degree have? sound like fucking man-child, god. Go take random sample get back estimate. 

I'm really unsure stupid thing trying say second sentence? know preventative measures places people unable gather indoors restaurants bars? interactions limited even though complain hoaxes masks. Even though lot friends neighbors other, sane friends neighbors want gather unsafely them. people delusional age range actually many close friends family. unsafe interaction comes going restaurants bars.

So, many people hang unsafe conditions, many places hang unsafe strangers. Thus spread limited despite amount exist.

Even limited; 200,000 people died people like them. 5% people acting like big hoax, together preventative closures, sure hell would lot fewer cases deaths are. That's basic math.


After looking comment history I'm gonna go ahead pre-emptively give explaining delusional person. Hopefully sane person life get mental help fix irrational thoughts. Yea well it’s causes harm rights, doesn’t actually anything protect you.

Would stand behind chain link fence protect handful marbles thrown way? That's I'm saying. anything, think coaches wearing masks net negative societal views Covid. makes look ridiculous regularly tested individuals tightly enclosed spaces 70 sweaty people wear masks. microcosm country's response disease. Focus showy restrictions take things way far point illogical, fail restrict things truly spread most. stomach tubes ( like many people have... including Dad passed) , extra oxygen( emphysema usually requires this) machines monitor vitals. Many patients also bed sores special mattresses help people cannot move well all. Bed sores start smell get infected quite unpleasant. Many nursing homes also patients longer short term memory, belligerent attitudes, broken hips.  Old age disease fun. Mental issues may require restrictive measures. Complicated, hopefully testing improved keep nursing homes safer. I'll honest Obama reason would still Obama trying take away Freedom lynching burning dummies Obama. actually feel like calm Trump helm Yikes that? Alberta?

That hundred years ago, evolved since then, like saved thousands lives. favourite counterexample HIV.

Nobody actually ever dies AIDS itself. Thing people said exact thing months now. plus side, Southern Hemisphere (who finished winter) *extremely* light flu season, presumably due Covid related precautions, see 

On negative side, probably going make flu vaccine efforts difficult, usually look Southern Hemisphere's flu season see strains dominant mix vaccines. little useful data year. Still worth get flu shot - even flu vaccines fail prevent infection, reduce symptom severity approximately 80% time. isn’t said all. can't understand we're still debating airborne. Seems pretty clear is. He's troll lol. Ignore him. looser brown Yeah, 6% died covid. /s Moving back LA like seeing first time I'd assume pre-existing conditions condemn hell. Good thing stocked March. first mistake trying civil discussion main sub K95 knockoffs still better cloth ones see lot people wearing Republican take Madison/Milwaukee problem rest state get whatever want. extremely well studied people, including white people, this, though. Intergroup bias one understood biases psychology.

See Bar-Haim et al. (2006) really interesting study this. Essentially, minorities raised majority population hold much less intergroup bias minorities raised minority population (leads intergroup bias majority) majorities raised majority population (leads intergroup bias minority). white people America raised among mostly white peers caretakers/teachers, leads intergroup bias. hell spread then? Fucking magic? Sure doesn’t mean they’re same. It’s like saying we’re fish cause DNA. Influenza mutates much faster rate SARS cov 2 yearly vaccine. Multiple experts come said likely won’t yearly thing forever. search it, indulge lazy habits I'm 100% mask wearing staying safe, complete pr virtue signaling. actually gave shit, they'd fans stadiums games, rather making look like they're something forcing regularly tested coaches wear masks make look good tv. Yes, stay safe social distance. Limit people houses please everyone go packed pubs restaurants 50% get scheme. fair, bet majority Americans say thing. minority believe science.  Yeah big idiot problem USA. Stacking dead, see. Hol' up... Yes suck Reddit asking you, works haha. sorry hear that, racism sucks rude person. Im still trying figure many people act terrible way, especially provoked. 
Yeah people general assholes included. think every place specific shitness them. 
My Filipino friends experienced life America tell general community America much nicer little less stuck Canada. love Filipino friends I've met definitely see mean say nice haha. girlfriend Mexican sad us Canadians general heard, says even come close genuinely nice people Mexico. like going America though claims Mexican Americans rudest people met, specifically also Mexican, understood yet we've figured something along lines they've established want anyone else come ruin that. 
Yes 'white' mixed bag European general, ever make fuss I've definitely say discriminated minority group, sucks!! Would never want anyone feel way. Maybe experiences helped growing little empathetic compassionate comes stuff like BLM avoid misunderstanding ALM thing. Anyways im sorry experienced what's probably one worst things Canada. alright, definitely best, long ways go too. hope pleasant experiences future ever may come back! nice winter though! nose remain warm!  Trick treating dumbest thing could year. Ah fuck, Canadian that's embarrassing. Ya hate see go way upvote? think everyone IQ 100 thinks tested human trials thousands participants. 

Yeah, know. I'll getting booster (second) shot Pfizer vaccine next five ten minutes. study 30,000 way 44,000. kidding? People going back normal NOW.  California proves best state union. No, legal. article talks illegal ones. Testing weeks 37 38 almost - around 140k parents disappointed children.  Add list reasons I'll moving Canada anywhere common sense decency matter. smell people already early voting. Can't buy votes. US, Reddit wouldn’t want anyone think that. Lol. Well American government's solution always cook stories give us ""reasons"" attack foreign country. create upheaval beautiful patriot #1 country world. 

Then send young fight battles old rich men mansions other. Let's real, we're pawns them. Patriotism scam. entire US scam. country that's great. good people there. find anywhere. government give rat's ass you. sure love pretend love country can't even get along person lives across street. I'm sure willing give life person. 

Fuck country fuck humanity general. I'm it. wake up, slave away work, enjoy whatever little time have, end that's really have. canadians clearly don’t know freedom is.



/s mean pandemic already ended US? Yes, wear 3M 6200 P100 filters least effective disposable mask personally prefer it, also consider proper gear. know mean shortages. ordered replacement filters last week spend time tracking exactly wanted. okay, kids wearing masks ;) Majority mankind good Peoples saddly assholes Way louder sage True. won’t really know years approach worked. god, comments. first world problem cringyness.

Still, oil exceptionally volatile year, it’s good news there’s big international economic slump year next. working vaccine created late, 250K dead disastrous number, sure go back normal mess. Canada president making ideological issue. People manipulated anywhere time, ones duress moment. physical back June. Doctors offices taking precautions, imo safe place. skip mouth ear stuff move mask. guarantee idea “just risk choose take” person tells themself release sense responsibility contributing conditions spread disease. 

It’s flimsy idea too. Power situation inherently uneven. money pocket free afternoon lunch, you’d free choose hamburger joint hamburger joint B. Easily interchangeable. university education easily dropped taken somewhere else all. 

When companies allowed force workers back office, companies said “come back work somewhere else.” one hiring. free choice? It’s not.  American dont appreciate boasting country waves end instead single continuous wave I’ll go place see people work off, down. flip walk in. usually leave try go somewhere elsewhere. ""Wearing mask correctly"". Wearing mask incorrectly nose renders mask utterly useless. fact worse wearing mask giving everyone around false sense safety. need say like often average person moron means half people dumber moron...  Sweden nothing

WHERE people getting from?? hell Thanks, thanks CDC. ""party""... us grandparents see regularly. I'm calling party try hype kids though.... New Jersey required wear masks entering places seated. People act like table impenetrable force field. yeah good run chill infection levels. second wave, sure, manageable almost entirely breakouts mostly contained- going really catch walking street anymore, nice. Jj double ppl believe plenty us Canadians thing

Yup, literally closed facebook post filled people crying face masks Nova Scotia. argued eradicate covid, something really doable. return normal following vaccine rather continue social distancing vain attempt eradication virus. true patriotism. decent citizen part help rather harm country. Yeah, that's one biggest worries. Sars2 could make something like common cold common Flu [more think they’re trying imply given high population states, number people won’t vaccinate, contagiousness virus itself, it’s extremely unlikely virus completely eradicated near future. assume it’ll 3-7 years virus fully gone knows might also mutate too. Thats get 'winner takes all' system. middle ground met. Kinda true though Lisa Murkowski

uh, polish root woman. seriously, fuck go R someone took authoritarian communist (back then) shit hole. I've begun calling it. polite. aggressive. ""Do know wear mask properly?"". They've always put right slinked away. times I've gone grocery store since  masks became manditory, that's exactly noticed. wear pull down. That’s one dumbest things I’ve ever seen. Lol. “back normal” meant mask requirements public places, bars reopened, sports, etc, assertion absolutely nothing changed since pandemic. sense we’ve “gone back” every pandemic history. can’t first pandemic world history cause us adopt permanent disruptive NPIs. I’m yet enough pessimist believe that. take transit everyone ive seen wearing mask. Im impressed people reasonable. Someone let Torontonians know everytime go out, see less less people wearing masks. wonder cases rising here. point guys plan stop wearing masks? vaccine comes? personally get vaccine? *Or government tells okay to?* Christ, sound insufferable.

""pErSoNaL fReEdOmS, bOwInG sOcIeTaL cOnTrOl"" one outbreak happen frozen meat coming china.

Actually, (American, food imports Australia well) company supplied food airport likely infection simply came one recent arrivals quarantine. never know sure point, found evidence source testing facility freight. given drect contact isolation facilities, that's simplest answer. think doomsday rhetoric comes lot political liberals actually hurts containment efforts much conservative downplaying honest reason. people reddit saying there's going bodies piling street complete collapse medical systems, people see shit actually happening, assume ""well guess experts lied then"" start ignoring messaging despite .6-1% IFR still pretty bad. think messaging remained consistently less alarmist honest would way easier keep people home. testing people per capita means testing better. war let's real here, government definitely helping second wave along due incompetence

But yeah ""under-nosers"" infuriating, prefer wear mask going Also good point. Surely beliefs also correlated negatively affluence Come back see couple thousand people reinfections might start taking seriously.

Give months.

And read posted. Scientists lot less confident are. *That* need know. I’m sure I’ve experienced ‘silent racism’ every country including home country (India). 

But Vancouver walking grocery store 2 older teens/young adults (prob 18-23) saw walked past. gave little smile ‘head nod’ quick hello gesture, ticked reason? said, “what smiling at? even here? Get fucking Hindu”. 

I pretty sure chose say grocery store close Hindu temple probably thought patron temple. wasn’t; tourist way Whistler! cure vaccine. Hopefully news shakes people enough protect others. We'll wave really weird fetish porn 5-10 years. People convince safe wear initially. many people wear mask restaurant, hey we’re table now. It’s safe eat people public Covid-or-Treat Canada Number 1. America Number 2. watch bunch Canadian outdoors people YouTube. actually inspiration lot outdoor activities - including snowshoeing winter camping trying first time winter. Canada best outdoors world year round! argument me, totally gotcha. passionately anti-mask believe protecting something much passionate maskers do.

This point falls flat. reach 'change' comes disingenuous.

They absolutely think 'protecting' anything. psychology this? Yes. going it? Yes. Pretending people willfully hurting others personal issues 'righteous' going get us anywhere. greater cause. selfish people told selfish. desperately believe anything tell otherwise. agree US leadership turned political issue - excuse grown ass adult acting like grown ass adult. Lol..don’t defile Zankous, put mask! relief Could used DPA military make sure N95 masks widely available. Could have....  Yeah test positivity rate higher america, meaning less tests per case Canada. really testing better thank POTUS that, president would told supporters virus hoax get go. That's started whole mess. Fauci lead failed coronavirus response gets praised know us southwestern Ontario even enunciate t's Toronto. Question you: plan stop wearing masks public? - less 0.004% Canadians (generalized pop.) surveyed. 

- sample population likely inherently biased

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seem bothered reading comments people hating masks people saying hate them.

A little worn cloth mask like 5 hours couple times, fine.

Amazing! lot people daily work Canada actually mask rules, they're allowed complain they're sweaty, uncomfortable, hate it. Understandably since post responded removed.

It implied poster interested keeping old people alive cost lives young ones. essence, mind old people (stating 80+ dying anyway important) die long young ones live life always wanted without restrictions.

And least two people downvoting post believe okay sacrifice older generation. Sad. rather take less inconveniences protect older folks. least wearing face mask reducing social activities hard do. job makes fill long questionnaire every day work exposed, symptoms, etc...if answer yes questions, allowed back work HR clears us. HR ask -even answer think exposed- get covid tested test negative. get DR note saying seen. everywhere busy short nightmarish really can't call out, sick, one wants go physical DR they've got cough, let alone pay $35 copay, miss day work pay, considered 'unplanned absence'. worst.  


We've since March, time bunch us missed survey times -it's easy forget, done 8am, new us-, given verbal warning missing two times, third apparently disciplinary action.  


Meanwhile, location alone they've sent three different people, different times, train 'had covid last month', felt like need wear mask around shared areas, also never tested negative it. expressed concern told 'no one knows covid work tested positive, medically proven safe two weeks'....My fiance medical school laughs every time tell us kinda stuff...lol... would hating short-sighted selfishness constantly see first hand imply hate myself? even watch news, forced interacting brain dead idiots live province. may point boomers rig monkeys voted Kenney he's working really hard undoing progress we've made last years. steal intellectual knowledge (vaccines). saying begin with. favourite state, Minnesota nice. Always felt home visiting there. still failed answer question. intended meaning comment, make fun decision keep schools open? Um... already mentioned Great Lakes. already bury Toronto’s trash. I’ve got nothing. see common sense washing hands using public toilet (which put chemical barrier mouth someone else's feces), reason putting physical barrier mouth someone else's spit might good idea. Could provide rationale? One three things happens: higher taxes, lower gov spending, inflation. bandaid harmful long-term repercussions

Edit: case printing money - inflation takes place. Since US Dollar used global currency, becomes larger issue. it’s worth, US Dollar Index dropped 8% since announcement first round stimulus checks people saying need lockdown there's vaccine ones saying trust vaccine. provide meta studies refute modelling studies asking clinical ask, ""gold standard"" measure, many countries use different limits?

Because science perfect never claims be? kind questioning Trumpian level thinking try undermine experts. Michigan territory US states within it’s borders they’ve got pieces every Great Lake except Ontario including lake St. Clair. actually look state boundaries, it’s loaded lot valuable commodities. course we're apes, think office workers somehow ape. lol Honestly wouldn’t shock Chinese government skipped steps experimenting prisoners. history normal times idea vaccinating political prisoners exposing virus doesn’t seem far fetched. extreme speculation part government bottom totalitarian behavior. Shame retailers even allowing sold.

Depends type N95 get. kind describing labeled disposable. certainly sell N95 masks intended repeated reuse much much higher quality straps, strap attachment points nose pieces easily last weeks months without wearing long treat well. I'm trivializing it. 

You politicizing it. That's fact. 

And thanks proving point. 

Cancer cause death complications. 

Covid cause death. covid related. 

200k covid related. 

You proved point. 

And lost old customer 97 years old due covid manhattan. But... caught flu bad cold pnemonia anything else would died. 

It's trivializing. understanding REALITY. 

however politicizing it. somebody think commercial landlords? I'm blaming liberal Americans American coronavirus cases, I'm pointing usually see liberal Americans pretending everything's back normal everywhere world besides America try score culture war points. Even cases lot lower things far normal, far normal everywhere there's vaccine treatments. India younger population less obesity Computers math. ultimately math problem, though admit, is, instance, pretty 1+1 ≠ 3 type equation. miserable sows even leave subreddit, let alone house lol report horrifying.

I never said beliefs would rational. I’ve believed severity covid since Feb/March. knew needed taking seriously. 

Something else important distinguish aren’t simply anti-masker one. varying degrees beliefs around them. every anti-masker selfish asshole screw communities live in, even though would easy say that.

It’s also worth clarifying I’m justifying actions either. rationalizing nature got are. legitimate danger average worker individual business enforcement mask policy. It’s ridiculous person barely teens needed practice deescalation aggressive deniers.

Unless course, protestor. rules seem apply.

My bottom line rules (mandates) begin with. would encourage healthy behavior. 

I less rules, smaller government. 

Like used 10 months ago.

1 year ago.

10 years ago. 

Smaller government / freedom. Civic duty words often brought attention American culture.

I say American. Troll not, seem relevant channel. People whose immune system impaired, well conditions due diabetes, cancer, HIV another type chronic disease, likely suffer reinfection COVID-19, stated Dr. Víctor Cabrera, integral physician Sisol Salud.

He noted virus new and, far, cases reinfected patients minimal. “It cannot said everyone disease suffer reinfection. It depends immunity generated due COVID-19 ”, explained.

He argued case Hong Kong patient, first reported reinfection case, shown still asymptomatic, despite presented first picture COVID-19. As US patient, required respiratory support second infection complex.

In sense, Sisol Salud specialist considered second COVID-19 infection mild complex; Everything depend level defense patient's body produced.

Likewise, stated reinfection prevented complying measures correct hand washing, touching face, social distancing, use mask use face shield.  Yay! !RemindMe 2 weeks worry, two months u able either. Lol Pelosi one currently blocking bipartisan $1.5 trillion bill seeing vote. Even Democrats calling out. pass Pfizer's first interim analysis turns miracle drug. ~80% effective better. Great true know people grasp long odds are. [Got ammo right  Yeah hate media paints Canadians perfect little boy/girl scouts none crap exists Canada US. 

They may majority Canada plenty see daily. rocks? *stay home save lifes* Luckily us U.S. something called FREEDOM don’t civic duty!

/s well that's quite obviously bullshit. millions people recovered, uptick life long disability. /r/murdochsucks supposed three day music festival month Chicago, refund hotel came conclusion really ever want travel US Makes perfect sense. Norwegians much less likely obese, also means they're less likely co-morbidities associated overweight.

They're also less likely belong ethnic groups vulnerable severe disease (although ethnic differences vitamin issue, effect might cancelled less sunlight). RemindMe! 100 days Outside shopping, business tempting return bowling alley. Still debating, business specifically mentioned HVAC situation reopening announcement. According them, ""We 10 rooftop HVAC units combined 72 air filters. unit utilizes ERV technology allowing 80% internal external air exchange rate way beyond 25% required code."" stop reporting influenza statistics globally? important time keep track.. look comorbidities, 50% people who’ve died covid also influenza, risk dying drastically increases. hell would stop data this? Given historical precedent, adverse events vaccines happen within 42 days injection. 42 days last injections Pfizer put mid November. 

interim efficacy readouts earlier. stops red lights? Snowflake. skip year! problem?
ak
So ask kid wants candy, means could reason grandparents even parents die kid could skip save loved ones.
if kid says candy....hmm...you something wrong.
i mean come on, guys really think go there, risk kids lifes, lifes lifes many others? reason america bad. population difference 7.8 times, Sweden 91 times amount coronavirus deaths literally neighbours. insane standard. literally copying energy parent commenter name calling lmao. 

and fair criticism considering supposed lead fight. 

Her leadership failure nobody respected decisions, clearly point out. squarely leader address, throw hands say ""well, tried, listen me"". 

The way people point Trump's failures leader.  I've recently leave apartment quite lot work Calgary pleasantly suprised turn-around Calgary last weeks. Mask usage 100 percent transit, stores, work. 

Please note previously case, even mandate. think normal make seem, people it. months 90% people personally affected business closing look back hindsight say lockdowns worth it. stopped hanging talking family. spout nonsense, I’m out. know stance don’t bring up. tell respect same. not, talk later sometime road. [spread read protection proposed actually stated negligence ignoring Covid safety standards acceptable reason sue. Knock off. 

Minimum wage employees enforce rules enforceable someone get antagonistic you. fish tank lights. (Made salt water fish course) even mention masks, corrected misconception provided source explanation. Ugh again? paying spread dangerous misinformation? I'm scientist studies daily, bringing incorrect survival rate sad. difference people without masks based us thinking right... I'm ACTUALLY right, dumb selfish. 

If comparing wearing fucking mask, basic simple hygienic thing improve public health pandemic, nobody countries issues with... religions recruiting people... totally opposite mind. cultists anti-maskers, scientist upset people selfish pricks. Atlantic? Again? Really...

Do people actually read virtue signaling tripe find inherent flaws within? ""Speak moistly me, baby""

Justin Trudeau, prolly Yes, fully anticipate, either Moderna Pfizer release interim analysis light order put pressure on.  infections starting go deaths go too. takes extra weeks. want clear: Exiting isolation guarantee you’re immune virus. possible become reinfected spread others, even COVID-19. one exempt wearing face covering practicing physical distancing.

I demand moderator subreddit. Ive first reinfection story. Im right, always. Took tons shit troll brigade here. Ive reported trolls. request administrative action immediately.  Dude, write that, absolutely Pfizer Replaced image office phone number. union rep shop steward know. Yes, agree. (Though babies people unable put remove masks generally exempt.)

I defending idea people getting fake exemption cards. kind facetious. Stop fear mongering.

From top article:


He said almost 200 vaccine candidates developed tackle disease. “Almost 200 vaccine Covid-19 currently clinical preclinical testing. history vaccine development tells us fail succeed,” Tedros added.

“SOME SUCCEED” - Tedros

Do even read articles spam constantly? Part problem Netherlands strong cultural norms ""don't stand crowd"" (""Doe maar normaal, dan ben je al gek genoeg"", ""steek je kop niet boven het maaiveld uit""). 

For example parents covid deniers all, they'll refuse wear mask want stand out. actually witnessed dad bringing mask, checking anyone else store wearing them, refuse put saw nobody else mask.

It's masks super political thing (for large share people) hard get people break cultural norms. 30% getting life long disability reinfection Ever hear minding business trying control everyone else? Kind like dogs shred mail comes hole door. Canada let come promise won’t bring Covid Oh yah young guy it’s unknown paradise. underrated city North America far. 

I’ve traveled lot world city I’d rather live Practical evidence. I'm debating anything. Compared drugs receiving covid19 treatment pneumonia symptoms, apparantly way harsher side effects. Including heart damage. 

This drug way less harmful. also allows people breathe. 

Instead trying force expertise here. random redditor. Go someone community may actually be-able see viable drug fight cotonavirus. Dying TIGHT People already living normally basically. Universities still 100% classes yet probably go back 100% class within 2 months, really matters since youths basically risk dying. lmao what. 

""She tried best, even though failed miserably"" 

I'm Trumper matter he's brain dead? competition also brain dead. 

at point idc lmao So... what’s process like move US Canada? neighboring countries dealing already strategy along. many swedes touting strategy long term sustainable special? see other, comparable, countries? ever get person passed on? heard night manager, security? trace person? closed borders China racist. Sheer coincidence happened right decision. deserves credit action. always idiots loudest. Unfortunately Long Island see lot people wearing improperly, nose hanging out, chin hanging out. think part people wear correctly actually wear them. live near Huntsville thought staggering. Imagine walking major city people. gone. Wiped face Earth.

It almost like feeling Nuke Map app. one put yield pick spot map. Huntsville would taken ""Castle Bravo"" (largest U.S. nuke ever tested) get levels fatalities Huntsville. Rough estimate course, thought sobering.  May walk tell Lord Savior Jobu?

Oh, wanna hear it? 

Well, I'm going get face make listen.

See that? That's sound. 

And think right, going convince someone thinks also right. 

(Psst..you 99.9% survival rate Coronavirus...just sayin'.) got shitload downvotes pointing ""A substantial increase COVID cases among young people lead deaths 2 months""

and yet, are; Two months mid-July deaths starting uptick. Exactly like saw Texas Florida. France following trajectory weeks too. There's ""It's totally safe young people!"" young people eventually infect older people deaths follow. think seem plan, least revealed public. timeline really original 12 18 months Fauci et al told media early year. would put us approx January July 2021 earliest &amp; IIRC vaccine itself, assuming working goes well. Distribution likely take everyone planet (or even half) need vaccination.  got black ones etsy recently already studied, mean coronavirus first virus transmitted air. believe surgeons wear masks surgery. Note self. Move Montréal. Beautiful city too. Lol ok ya whatever....I highly doubt say place worse it’d Wisconsin, shit state. I’m Wisconsin BTW bars still packed one seems care lol go pack! mean, ""life needs move on?"" people careless dont take basic precautions easy cheap (masks, distancing, hand washing, essential activities, etc) , life wont move die someone else's inability refusal protect others. endure basic precautions mentioned considered punishing people?

There 200,000 US alone life never ""move on"" for. part mean sustainable? boardwalk outdoors. safe tight spaces large crowds? think way survive healthy. rate whole country infected. going start working long break risk category better get one late October can. shitty sounds, loss life going keep happening. That’s life works. deaths Covid decrease amount flu, would success. There's huge Hasidic Jewish community here. 

They generally large families, enjoy going walks scooter rides (taking entire sidewalk) gathering together. That's fine, anxiety inducing see 20 kids come house congregate sidewalk. could walking 4 kids zoom bikes scooters. 

Montreal's legal limit people gathering indoors 250 Jewish holidays coming up, wanted impose 50 person limit them. 

It's hard badly affected Brooklyn, believe well. Israeli friend mine said they're reason there's second wave Israel well. everything else he's done killed him, hard time believing coronavirus anything. Hell I'd almost bet he'd like one mutants Sci-fi gets sick body creates super antibody could cure us. mean ratio confirmed cases deaths attributed virus?

Because really tells who's testing. Mexico probably worst country world testing (fewer 1.6 million tests, 44% positive rate), they'll inevitably terrible CFR.

India done 65 million tests 9% come back positive. words, tests Mexico 5 times likely come back positive.

The difference Mexico India's CFR almost perfectly matches difference positive test results. ever bar social gathering talked strangers? Wearing mask conducive that. get feeling type person, lot people enjoy it. seem comprehend talking about. Every state Australia control. mean getting 0 cases.

It seems like trying rationalise terrible country done. Maybe learn rest world speak bulshit. drinking age lower. Wouldn’t way around lol  Lol, reductive overly simplistic argument perfect sub. Yes... that's seasonal is. That's Europe brink second wave. It’s many dying today it’s many would die everyone resumes normal life. That’s much much higher, probably around 40-50 day least. don’t understand people still confused this. several friends lose family natural events head car crash Covid listed secondary cause. Friend hung Covid listed secondary. numerous claims 4chan thing occuring. Hospitals receiving financial incentives CoVid deaths yet one seems see problem. really flip coin would undeniably large amount reinfections, isn't. 

And need know details reinfection, get serious case, get re-infected asymptomatic, virtually immunity. 

But again, say re-infection long term issues occur significant quantity fear-mongering pseudoscience.

And again, sources back claims. sure shit wouldn't. nearly much think.

I almost guarantee people wear masks make sure they're assaulted mask-crazy zealots. died death. Seems obvious. think insignificant portion anti maskers want get ""liberals masks"" sick intentionally. Cuomo shown empathy instead killing nursing home population. hurted feels. think it'd super fun one enforce wearing mask, watch someone ignorant inconsiderate suffer enjoyable, gotta love instant karma vids. think saw one place fining people 50$ upped 100$, I'd that. pointing sources support statement projecting exactly?

Please explain, another exercise able make coherent argument suitable adult. lot already come Michigan drink beer, lol. btw, Pfizer vaccine really called BioNtech vaccine.

With logic, AstraZeneca's Oxford vaccine Based what? 

If can't prove someone sick, treat like are, fact people think insidious. Neither you. We're thinking here. Deals change.

I doubt states would leave longer vote advantage everyone else. counting that, especially young people, going comply that. Yeah, chance.

I tried warn this, downvoted oblivion. listened. Sigh.... early news report woman Wuhan might gotten delivery package (left solarium hour, disinfect) turned lived husband, son daughter law, seems rather likely one asymptomatic carrier infected also tested false negative.

Sorry, people ""passionate"" white supremacy protecting ""race"" passion excuse horrifying belief system.

Scroll daily new deaths. direction headed in?

You understand total deaths go up, right? Another good example media Reddit actually listening Tedros said. He's saying there's guarantee **any single vaccine** going work. Listen words said, think headline may mean. point need cooperate vaccines together. That's followed point talking COVAX programme.

So no, Tedros saying there's guarantee we'll get working safe vaccine. says history vaccine development tells us work work. therefore need work together maximizing chances getting successes. GOP held Supreme Court voted democratic governor allowed enforce lockdown mask restrictions Canada never burned first one down. interested anything offer get board supposed get control virus, rocket science Fauci said. needs middle ground. can't let millions lose lives businesses given fighting chance. point needs become personal responsibility we're fucked either way shock think rich suffer rather us.

Among study, 4.1 percent teachers 35 44 died autoimmune diseases compared 1.9 percent professionals. fact, mortality rates diseases elevated teachers across age ranges. 

This one risks teachers must take wish teachers. sense real danger media invoked hysteria. thing sides!

Heres undeniable scientific proof aliens might like, dont believe youre ""anti-science"" whatever down. ""Total deaths"".

What direction headed in? “The spikes positive COVID tests coming 2 major universities county recently started upbringing approximately 60,000 new students area. universities already strict mask mandates. response concentrated problem area, entire population county suggested. 

I agree this. San Diego similar boat, main contributor spike cases reported SDSU area students bringing counties/states. think time stop punishing following mandates guidelines lockdowns, time start fining violators. arrests necessary, “I find interesting nation demanding police reform, yet every time crisis response is, pass law let police worry it. Then, resource provided police arrest citation. believe better that. 

This common straw man ""Defund Police"" movement. speak everybody, doubt fringe elements really feel entire law enforcement establishment completely dismantled, understanding majority supporters simply feel police wrong tool lot jobs assign them, funding assign jobs ill-trained perform redirected new existing groups better equipped. basically laid main argument ""Defund Police"" suggestion do, create new crisis response teams out-sized budget allocated police catch options arrest citation. better, defunding police health issue, community issue, addressed such. criminalized. federal government given Utah hundreds millions dollars address issue, Utah County received 100 million that, still, best resources options money could provide dump problem police criminalizing it. 

This massive misstatement. Yes, millions allocated, know went. That's likely valid criticism. However, regardless much money spent, experts decide one best tools, cost effectiveness standpoint issue mandate, law enforcement's job enforce mandate. Even department's funds cut follow ""Defund Police"" course action, would still fall firmly purview, considering many violators mandates demonstrably “The issue mask, approach. first entered pandemic health order issued restricted gatherings larger 10 people. citizens calling police fellow citizens holding family gatherings public places well private property. incidents public disorder citizens due order. mask mandate generate responses. 

I'm sure point is. create work? course will. creating vaccine, see researchers throwing hands saying it. course action government takes contain virus require work. create work, government nothing virus contained. stop bothering police people breaking law would actually jobs?

I perhaps sympathize department one thing, funding state county received probably allocated enforcement course state/county decides take. work increases due requirement enforce pandemic related measures, payroll goes up, accommodated. Maybe. know emergency funding may access - possible funds already exist outside funds received specifically COVID. example, major disaster required provide additional manpower extended period serve protect, one assumes funds exist cover that. COVID “The real mandate elected officials address specific problem specific areas affected **with community-based approach promotes buy-in acceptance community**,” Sheriff Smith added. 

I'm getting shivers closely line reasoning tracks whole Black Lives Matter Defund Police movements. I'm Canadian yes feel  [It’s fun look back still occassionally naive enough believe explain things people logic facts. another post, asked exactly question: 6% 200,000 deaths COVID-19 related, killed 190,000+ Americans unexprectedly died since beginning year.

Last time looked, downvoted it. believe stupidity - purely politically motivated. persuade enough people deaths, deaths wrongly counted, maybe nobody blamed. suck. We're laughing stock world. 

- Love, unfortunately American. There’s definitely waves. Everyone catches first wave. people never got come hiding, second wave starts.

That’s nonsense talk 20% herd immunity wrong. That’s “herd immunity” amongst population that’s currently “out there” getting exposed: essential workers, anti-maskers/deniers.

There’s another huge portion population socially distancing (yes, still) haven’t covid, thus they’ve immunity could potentially part second wave come hiding. Canada looking like place live Lol holy shit misinformed need something like risk management training, hard rules. They’re confused.

This best summary 2020 I've seen far. That's cute idea!

I’m assuming you’re speaking experience that’s tough. Gotta look vendors buying. That’s like rule #1 lol. Stay home stay safe That's good point - weeks, Denmark's already managed reach spread first peak. That's incredible carelessness, reason sadly much hope them. Fact is, they're currently faring worse Sweden. Yeah, one upset this. one gradual return normal vaccine rolled course 6 months.

The reason everyone flustered aren’t clear plan is. social distancing required vaccine due distribution time? Fine. plan socially distance, wear masks vaccine **has** rolled partially effective. fine.

The fact hasn’t clear message worrying me, believe following latter statement. feel like 99% know Covid comes South Korea China. actually keep actively researching virus spreads. Yeah get that. It’s OP clearly doesn’t. time ""anecdotal"" like reinfections months ago, also shit lazy level need seperate dorm positive cases students can't leave till negative test. Food delivered.

Maybe missed something report also shows Sweden older population. large % people 80 example. looked though. 

There many ways measuring old youre population is. Average median life expectancy another indication good country keeping citizens alive. ironically ""bad"" thing talking corona deaths. majority Americans everyone else world. really news. family member told keep AC turned hot climate, couple windows open opposite sides home, create airflow one end home other, keep airflow house significantly reduces chance getting covid.

That’s weak. wait. man cannot named throw hissy fit get taken down. kind like people r/politics long protects bodies immune systems. lead all. He's infectious diseases researcher NIH.

In theory CDC would coordinate public messaging Trump refused allow talk. We're family four we're Star Wars party. us dressing up, going watch Mandalorian premiere play Star Wars theme games. issue countries well.

Devout adherents three Abrahamic religions refusing take virus seriously continued normal behaviour (just look parts England first go local lockdowns weeks ago). Strangely enough, media seems focus purely Christian churches... banned spamming, yet? good points. yes, I'm blue overwhelmingly red conservative state. describes family, too, lol. Yes people might respond still follow level look around look like that. Everything bit normal now. people subway. Way people back offices etc want live within civilization, civilized person.
 
You fucking cretins. sort hostility mean? many unemployed people wanting things like food shelter causing trouble. one solution: send killing machine. Presto. unemployed people causing trouble. Cornell least partially public school.

I agree probably smaller seed cases. lot fact you’d look harder find kids don’t believe virus Time start working beach bod summer 2021 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) They're called Juggalos. can't validate someone filter it. makes pretty useless others. printing money really solution here?

Yes. Yeah patting back dropping 3% probably horrible effects. 

People think ""oh virus going down!"" continue go back life virus problem causing another wave increasing infection levels current wave. hate people jumping gun overly positive news virus decline. Really news celebrate vaccine made available everyone (AFFORDABLY) I've seen lots people use flu death statistics wonder we're panicking death rate &lt;1% justify wearing masks, licking doorknobs, cuddling people talk them. ways would counter arguments? grandmother Army stretcher carrier spanish flu epidemic flu. died parkinson's. read, people spanish flu 3 times likely get parkinson's. Yeah, don’t know pinpoint exactly causes numbers go either annoys see positive trends happening people like “it can’t true see many people breaking rules!” it’s like well looks true maybe start trying figure it’s happening rather rejecting data doesn’t fit preconceived notions everyone needs pandemic Yes, see number cases decline certain period without pattern upticks, that's considered end wave. cases start rise consistently again, that's start new wave, we're currently seeing Ontario.

Ending wave mean cases whatsoever, total halt cases period, means specific number cases consistently. like said, free go live forest own. 🤷 Alt-right morons moderators. let everyone know
My opinions. Isn’t social media ? FYI Doctors drug dealers Scams include: Capitalism, American health care system, American ""democracy"" cases spiked Black Lives Matter protests people protested nothing changed still locked down.  Eh, that's flesh wound. Literally MSM FOX NYP. personal favorite Atlantic.  100K retarded, NFL money? “So tired talking masks....” exactly stop that? Costco Winnipeg. hand free masks. 1 every 5 people wearing mask everyone sardined. second wave ourselves. Obvious troll obvious.

Try reading again, champ. uhm, surely baclog weekend (there report weekends yesterday reported deaths lower) big picture good all. restrictions put need wait know things go better not. Mods need ban crap. Unfortunately Canada even federal law requiring masks work. Since individual districts counties decide. Even still laws prevent us enforcing it. Like edmonton bylaw masks required. Except allowed question people mask on. law teeth. Nobody forced wear mask essentially.
Oh mention 'exception cards' require proof get one. thousands people got one stopped giving away like candy. Except they're recalling another batch theyre say ehh screw letting thousands people exception cards run around reason. goddamn right That’s well flavor partisan screeching would recommend instead? exactly qualifies big wave? Madrid thought big wave spring, experiencing even bigger second wave.

There doubt immunity going summer. sufficient own. predestined second waves smaller. Much comes human behavior. Lol heard one yet. That's... interesting take. r/vaccineswap Tell Americans, actually don’t bother. gonna get argument them, end aliens fake news. hating grammar nazis. Looks like move sideline US According worldometers, 204,913 deaths. Followed Brazil 137,445, India 57,594.

But know that's testing. /S

Edit: Thought might also relevant; five countries — Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Spain Brazil — rank higher COVID-19 deaths per capita. agree you. however point luck catching time. countries could luck governments acted much earlier, choice. I’m also tired public health experts think glory hole sex safe form sex have. source fucking title. even article. website bunch spam it. it. 

Go fucking dipshit drama queen somewhere else. Masks mandatory NS last 2 months, handling virus cautionary thing helps containing virus. seen anyone without one. Ya, know. I’m sure you’re anti-mask given seem know effectiveness. weird fighting you’re show you’re anti-mask, even though comment clearly implies are. Two uncle David’s?! That’s cool really depends neighborhood. I've noticed Latino-heavy working class hoods mask way posh upscale enclaves like Brentwood SM. think older Latinos realize they're risk Chads Karens who're zooming home. post locked due high volume comments celebrating death. Regardless allegiances, celebrating death permitted sub poor taste. Really?! work school rural MN multiple staff members teaching children wear face shield. fact, admin SAID could use shield place mask, students could see lips moving they're teaching. frustrating. [450 Room hotel closed Bintan, Indonesia. property mainly serving Singapore vacationers. Things equally bad Bali etc &amp; hotel staff gone back jobs fishing/farming etc. also justin trudeau charge

...yeah small near San Francisco.  afford drive neighboring housing prices still come way ahead. lot cash budgeted, companies need lot since recession everyone thought would come never really outside hospitality. There's much doomsaying covid flu, honestly kinda expect relatively calm flu season areas making social distancing efforts move lot refusing wear masks. Funny that. Well, wrong, dug heals bow societal control even legitimate reason so. hope works you.

edit: quite rare wear pants outside. Sadly see lot Germany well . Especially supermarket usually go to, went employees wearing mask correctly 2 months ago wearing under-nose(or dick hanging style prefer) mask hang one ear... also queues went ordered distancing clogged mess Apparently Americans think wearing mask personal affront individual rights...the right stay healthy (or not) spread virus knowingly unknowingly every single person come contact with... difference line questioning though. poll Canadians asked people opinion masks thought civic duty wear one. American poll asked people wore not.

Yes 85% wearing US mean shit-talking time.

Also definitely depends area, shows Republican-leaning Americans least likely group wear mask 76% mask-usage Democrat-leaning Americans highest 92%. somewhere there's overwhelming number right-wing voters gonna less mask usage (shocking, know). Oh, shoot. screwed. spread spread later, baby? truth often horrific.

We ignored reopening metrics opened prematurely without ever seeing 14 day decline. 

Our governor issued executive order preventing local judges, mayors, officials ever issuing lockdown mask mandate. 

Our governor, watching bodies pile up, finally decided make statewide mask mandate made toothless unenforceable causing dozens sheriffs judges declare refusal enforce it. 

State officials mandated in-person opened schools regardless local outbreaks - covid measures taken. lead texas teachers association (public unions outlawed) sue state fulfilling standards set teacher student protection.

 We've consistently gotten worse testing. California reported 150,000 tests yesterday, Texas reported 29,000, 65,000 peak. 

County officials across state deny virus even problem, insisting high school college football. universities thousands infected students 3 weeks August. state department health education agency, despite closing schools march, set student tracking system - still debating late early September. primitive system week shoddy reporting implemented last week.

etc. Me: Talks sparsely NZ populated

Redditor: uR rOnG CoViDD stIl MakE pPl SicKK!!11!!!!1

Fucking idiot lmao that's point. think arguing about?   Hell yeah! Free healthcare! \- ""Instead following science data, Evers’ continuing 'one size fits all' approach virus, doubling strategy proven ineffective age group driving COVID-infection spike,"" said Wanggaard statement. - 

What hell Wanggaaard talking about? Governor literally following science. people like Republican State Rep contributing misinformation, dismissal science. continue disappointed state every day. source didn’t get posted make front page forum. post opinion piece.

Just like opinion long-haul COVID anxiety, pulled ass.

Go dipshit somewhere else. Aging chronic disease must neighbourhood specific. I’m Leslieville seen odd person nose uncovered. 

Even outside walking street ppl wearing masks.

We wear condo building, elevators, hallways, still don’t allow delivery people building- drop things vestibule outside lobby. 

When I’ve beach everyone really spread well... honestly quite impressed obviously parts isn’t happening seeing uptick now. impression too. think people use synonymously common cold.

They compare. caught H1N1 back 2009 pandemic fever actually 40 degrees Celsius. Can't even stand without passing out. don’t get it. hear americanos say, “the government can’t regulate clothing I’m supposed wear.” Actually every day. wear pants right? months Sweden deaths per day we've entire year, insane standards Please reach need help navigating trying times.

* 0 deaths/day
* mask wearing
* lockdown Thanks, man. curious, bud. Thanks replying like dickhead, though, totally reasonable question. people legitimate issues

I’m curious issues might be, that’s it. I’m asking medical history, fucking bellend. Followed significant fall urban housing prices, small rise suburban exurban housing. enough promiscuous young people still hook opportunity arises. too, buddy. No, think military announced role transition power. 


I think accurate say would aide non-elect Trump day power officially transitions. Honestly think I’ve seen one person past month wear one incorrectly stores. condo aren’t mandatory, lot people wear all. really banned sub mods. sake. Vancouver Island here. High five, friendo. Seriously. Americans think too. issue ruin things There's medical reason wear mask anyone carrying card likes liar science denier. I’ve seen people straight wear nose. know badly want call out? wear face shield mask now. I’m going continue wearing mask even pleasure inhale everyone’s breath plus side add shades people don’t even recognise  Welllll experts say they’re seasonal... means spread easier winter people spend longer indoors together poor ventilation. 

Viruses definitely still infect kill people warmer weather. We’ve tens thousands people die spring summer I've tried - persuade - still hoax liberal media lie. There’s also fact chance whatsoever reported cases deaths anywhere near actual cases deaths. dense country 1.3 billion 65 million completed tests compared US’s 99 million. actual cases probably exceeded tens millions months ago. 84% Americans wear masks 75% think mandatory. anti-maskers loud idiots like anti-vaxxers. It’s really even partisan issue 81% Republicans wear too. Listen words said, think headline may mean. 

You mean read articles? Crazy talk. 2% general population. Link study? you’re anti mask you’re pro pandemic way better using electrostatic spraying instance, since UV light sterilizes ""see"" it, whereas spray blow around bit.

Anyhow, conclusion lot people jumping thread far UV blows virus air make safe get together again, that's obviously case takes seconds kill virus. Yeah man, keep thinking mask anything value.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Page 18 report says: wear mask, wearing mask protects others virus, obligation wear civic duty?

87% say yes

I take good thing. still don’t see volunteering trials. Bye. Nice cut paste job, however. seems lack fit structure like N95 made can't pass filtration test correctly? while, least better surgery mask. Yeah, seems like get used it, people seem think rules don’t apply them. think “oh it’s couple friends” kind thinking common enough it’s contributing problem. Sweden 90 % 11 days, sometimes regional agencies reporting everything batch causes big spikes; like countries day report completely worthless (like Sweden fortunately does) deliver actual day death well. deaths dated back three weeks think. bad, bureaucracy works. remove regulations make voluntary. 87% adherence would enough keep spread control...based ""science"" work. sure need regulations public esteemed sense civic duty. Oh right, know poll entirely bullshit, removed mask mandates virtually one would wear them...just like mandates. 

*Timer started quickly comment removed.  point masks wear can't socially distance.

That's obsession masks bizarre me. mostly younger people infected recently, infections across age groups rising. 

It takes around month go infected death, infections spike wait week two hospitalisations spike, another two weeks translate deaths spiking. Sure, diabetes well managed active, regularly going hiking forest, bear, trying tell could lived years decades more? Preposterous! 

/s left wing media telling people wear masks? nightmare scenario vaccine gives protective immunity, sterilising immunity, still catch Covid, still infect others, get sick. need get everyone vaccinated exactly time, otherwise asymptomatic carriers spread Covid unprotected. said happened 30% get retracted math add up, flip coin Right, ok, think I'll bother trying convince otherwise seeing what's going on. thing last 6 months. I'm scared taking vaccine Trump admin I'm liberal comes. get tons vaccines every time travel. 

I'll keep quarantining waiting while. given clear way line get someone reputable like Obama taking it, I'm in. drug company ""openly expecting"" ""advertising"" zero merit good vaccine ready.

you want early vaccine, sure, Russian China already it. heck, may better whatever Astrazeneca Pfizer have.

and btw, Pfizer vaccine really called BioNtech vaccine. Asia coming year speak real end sight. Sure places like South Korea &amp; Taiwan nipped bud early outbreaks pop time time even strict adherence rules. exactly said comment.

Likely death toll higher, excess deaths might better way count.

The incorrectly recorded ones (although few) create conspiracy theorists. 

That entire point.

We need careful put public. CDC said wear masks. never completely recover blunder. Also, deaths. good fraction (about half IIRC) people SURVIVE covid long-term reduction health. feel like people outside school what’s going spread anyways. Like kids teachers schools wear protection world majority acting like nothing changed outside school rates still go up. Tell reach idiots uneducated folk think get them. Go downtown Toronto see Check Hmm, thats strange last Friday popular uni bar huge fucking crammed line full students trying get wearing masks social distancing. Look ozone. wasn’t politicized. issue found solutions brought Congress quite quickly industry. Everyone accepted reality even though may cost industry halting problem CFCs. 

Now republicans denying anything isn’t advancement defense democrats denying new economic evidence. Osterholm’s weekly podcast well TWIV helpful Right? feel like celebrate safe way, people can't handle adapting ALL. Sometimes use imagination. 

If kids, better bet ass I'd give something interesting days! WOW! CLEARLY one many get it.

Like ideal always stop spread, people can't even get selfish selves that.

It's easy stay inside 2 weeks time (only get necessities), enables avoid encounter horrible people like yourself.

""People 70 lived \*their lives""... Wow, sound like kill-squad, know does. Let's say possibility mean like that. give retirement time, near end, put years work?

You people even sit place 2 solid weeks (that's essentially would've taken), want living ancestors give kid wants skittles (yes, know user)? Make sure also applies old US benchwarmer old people going rallys. least hardly anyone side wears masks. help natural selection bit.

You certainly comment LOT coronavirus. whole situation get mentally motive? I1) it’s going happen infections going up. 2) numbers similar numbers much lower death toll overall. Sweden really messed beginning. good full lockdown. usual idiots jumped lockdown always count those.

Since summer public transport crowded again. impossible keep distance subway/trains Madrid goverment seems unable nothing it. 

Also summer terraces open tons people time masks ofc safe distance. economy important mostly run by: tourism terrace/restaurants/pubs.

With facemasks many problems. Many people use handmade face masks totally useless think look cute dont really care. geniuses dont use em all... ""my freedooooom!"" brilliant arguments.

Also health system claiming daily need another 5000 doctors avoid full collapse. dont money. 

Now middle yet another political battle extreme left party decided perfect moment rally forces make huge protests Madrid.

So yeah. heading another lockdown doubt. Question long gonna brilliant leaders gonna meanwhile... Microchips must ready yet. you? Montreal go get line get test, get results 24~48 hours. line really long (a hours weekends) anyone wants one gets one. Shocking...just keep waiting. disappear like miracle... think cultural plus crowded spaces people big believers Covid, care think unlikely contract it. mean sure occurs, significant amount, thats people actually interested in, say 1/1million people get permenant brain damage virus, doesnt mean happens significant degree, degree concern, re-infection long term issues.

once again, still source.  ready death glares paranoid. Unfortunate, life still needs move on. punish people aren’t sick? It’s problem stop frisk. 9 weeks counting. prob another month ahead them. wont normalcy though. keep borders closed. people staring day, come realize rubbish actually is. Working class read herald sun footy races. right wing shit written journos way apparent 30 years ago paper.

Sky news nobody watched shit full ex polis foxtel dying. Hardly anyone watches news cept broadcast even smaller ppl watch netflix, youtube etc. Followed by? It’s already happening Toronto surrounding areas. Condos soft, suburbs 20% YoY. Yeah amazingly Tegnell seems love speaking them. didn’t start speaking criticizing others wouldn’t happen first place. wave talk mutation 1918 flu.

Also every single influenza pandemic since then. Even [2009 H1N1] distinct waves. Regional upticks still expected. Long-term means like, year now. We’re taking lot granted here. vaccine may end pandemic, all. it’s 50% effective immunity lasts 3 months, SARS-CoV-2 would continue spreading unfettered. Let’s hope vaccine ends this, whether takes 6 months, year, even 2-3 years. better all. 7 day average number new cases per day dropped 10% September 7, Labor Day, September 8. consistent normal pattern testing business days less testing weekends -- ""drop"" number cases reporting artifact, actual improvement conditions.

7 days later, number cases rose back levels before, since Monday Labor Day normal business day. like previous drop reporting artifact, things getting better, rise also reporting artifact, things getting worse. first approximation, new verified cases flat last 4 weeks, test positivity also holding fairly steady (5.2% 28 days ago, 4.6% today), means actual number new cases probably also holding steady.

But GP right number new cases definitely since July -- average number new cases per day positive rates significantly second peak (67,317 / 7.1% positive 2020-07-22, 43,318 / 4.6% positive 2020-09-21). got get mask. really response? limited evidence, try want, introduction mandatory masks done almost nothing overall infection rate. 

The rate infection UK bars, schools restaurants - masks - absolutely tiny. clearly documented look numbers. OK, cool. Let's talk science. 

Let's talk Pfizer Phase 1 trial successful, sped up, influenced politicians, well-tolerated across participants.

Let's talk how, study, vaccine produced 1.6 3.8 times number antibodies (measured GMTs) produced people actually infected -- yes, mean works, we'll get that.

Let's talk vaccine induced CD4+ (more importantly) CD8+ T-cell responses spike protein surrounds SARS-CoV-2, CD8+ T-cells thought important immunity -- yes, mean works, we'll get that.

Let's talk rhesus challenge study prevented lung infections rate 100% despite dosed directly high viral load, also cleared nose 100% three days -- yes, mean works, we'll get that.

So talk positive data points, let's talk what's happening need wait ""years"" results vaccine trial:

- We're already intimately familiar coronaviruses already done lot legwork previous outbreaks funding available
- time, funding much readily available up-front ongoing, removing financial roadblocks stopped previous work
- active worldwide spread much rapid anything we've seen last 100 years, providing cases study faster ever

There rarely point perform entire Phase 3 trial completion determine efficacy -- make trials big enough people get infected compare inoculated group control group, faster happens, faster prove efficacious vaccine within confidence interval gets stronger numbers grow.

So, yes, 150-175 infections need get good read efficacy late next month, continue studying entire 26 month duration Phase 3 trial extremely rare potential side effects -- importantly -- duration immunity roll vaccine slow spread disease killing thousand people day.

But means, tell following sources false flags scientists anti-science.

Sources:

Sure makes sense problem right keeps publishing bs stories newspapers sweden ‘beating’ virus Sweden well without lockdowns etc. pursue agenda try persuade fellow countryman eschew restrictions whatsoever, ignore growing death toll keep working. That’s keeps coming back. fascination picking sweden. won’t long take 30 minutes. put piece foil. That's source KN95s manufacturer undergone CDC respirator assessment listed FDA's EUA. 100% guarantee manufacturer could theoretically make good batches unexpectedly downgrade process materials, pretty good bet. seven months pandemic people still can't figure what's good bad mask, natural selection point. Yeah I've seen lot people trying use one past couple weeks - people know, randoms internet. get it. fully support victims go me, personally. point becomes continually grey area enforce wearing mask, sit shit go least amount possible - say something I'm asshole. worth anymore part world burning rather watch burn limited safety home. can't imagine U.S is, heart goes you. CIA already every phone, tracing people. america bad?  contrast, see Americans plague refugees come there? I’m sick people here. I’ll quarantine 14 days, lock internet it’ll like normal life except without idiot anti maskers wanna beat child doesnt burn melt plastic/glue used anchor straps? early gabejesus made “not like paratroopers airborne” quote it’s chaos ever since. eyes so, way did. way. like people Netherlands able spin arguments till exhaustion justify nobody wears masks. KN95? another Korean boy band? 
Never heard mask labeled KN95 That’s exactly things playing USA. sure isn’t working super well Uhm, where, exactly? ones read mostly *Swedish people* criticizing articles. Schools. Kids eating lunchtime without masks. 
 
Restaurant eating.

Bar drinking. 

Wat r u even talking about? Sweden tried novel approached. failed. Plain simple. 

Kudos trying however, played people's lives.  Well that's whole problem. society, live together. exact attitude spreads everywhere comes back family.

But yes basically inhale closes part breathe mask like one without vent. Yep works too. also buy ""earsavers"" hook mask back head. Dammit Canada, look South we're saw video rickshaw drivers japan wearing masks like this. doubts.... nice able lip read people, understand made... anything. Keep digging hole, kiddo. That’s still astonishingly low 30 million cases Oh yeah. moralize want argue either direction..but...but...those protests really shot Lefts credibility large swathes country. 

But make fairly good case studies regarding airborne transmission. NYC nonstop protests and...as said...street fairs...and spike. love light-hearted comments make serious problems funny.

And people still wonder take virus seriously. obviously poll BC /s What's point? certainly one. one I'd like see sub. on. Deny reality.

“He didn’t mean that! It’s said! meant something else.”

You guys legit lost minds. Talk falling propaganda. draw mask face, saves money reduces apparently tremendous amount effort takes wear mask. Win-win. news? Without even looking im almost positive majority every country thinks this. masks look like great idea get one tell people know start wearing restrict breathing particles others faces like surgical ones do. get covid that. question wether cloth masks provide adequate protection acts like touching face, improperly putting on, washing could actually make worse. give false sense security trying keep social distance.

Fact though cloth masks provide protection surgical mask n95 masks. sure it’s safe place high concentration like grocery stores getting car worked receptionist one :/ family member mine died Covid spring. got wacky letter mail metrics lag behind new cases though. means nothing month see many died new cases. thing know bad cases rising. 

You dont get diagnosed, put hospital, ICU, die day ! I'm enemy. always wear mask socially distance. Living TX, encouraging number low, seems exponentially higher here. also referring 35% mask wearing, Trump mindset. could try run countries want current citizenship. apes. office workers monkey brained idiots laborers monkey around swinging tree branch tree branch. cause french canadians shit? i’m asking i’m quebec hard time see someone wearing mask yet nose exposed lol.. want ask put condom half way like wtf always going carbon filter thats great unfortunately that's case, maybe seen any. No, Americans don’t wear them. I’m sorry ‘clear Im trying say US numbers good right trending down. good sign. 30k/day right 60k/day. still long way go order truely get handle it. compared canadas current exploding numbers like night day. numbers low right rate going wont stay low long. Usually people pay price poor lifestyle choices get older. bills coming due sooner please beware! think uneducated population

Lol, imagine trying act like US population uneducated... disgusting food servers wearing weird ass 4""x4"" plastic mouth window None individual risks.  personal risk taking, taking risk people around later well. go look people died due others attending wedding Maine (none dead actually attended, personal choice) mean forget back early June left BLM rallies. Regardless whether spread COVID optics scolding people leaving house gathering thousands people looks awful. Especially since lot rallies basically took shape impromptu street festivals art vendors live music. there's valve air going directly 0 filtration. least ""tightly woven mask"" SOME.  notice keep going cheap shots perceived intelligence others instead addressing ongoing trials published plans developers considered good confidence interval sample size, etc? That's debate science, petty arguing. Lmao, cops individuals rights too. Can’t charge weapon expect nothing happen...

Anyhow, post football fines... pointing meme poorly contrived places bs guidelines actual laws blanket label “rules.” security guard Michigan denied entry someone mask. came back relatives executed poor guy behind. lol population evenly spread. means actual population densely populated areas. actually matters infectious virus,

Also, would assume disagreeing? Maybe glad someone finally agreed unpopulated bush effective defence covid. 

(I definitely making fun though). Yeah, checked history knew latter, ya know... Reddit. :p ""Any country higher numbers country 1 million well"" insane standard. think they're probably taking account elderly &amp; immuno-compromised catching flu time 2nd Wave. newest modeling shows flu time infected covid doubles mortality rates :/ read graphs, tell straight face see trend change graph due Swedish vacation month July. Ok, El País taking numbers? Something odd these. arrested resisting arrest. concur. keep seeing ""well need office"", ""these difficult times need engage unusual solutions"" whatever corporate side that's really excuse go back business usual.

Yeah, get - better situation, get people tired it, get smaller businesses gobs cash lying around continue weathering storm-without-end.

However guilty businesses are, employees generally even less so. damned fault world fucked tired playing safe. like tell someone wrong (social distancing effective thing) tell someone provide study instead yourself. article says Netherlands government’s advice goes medical consensus across Europe, reasoning give masks might work disincentive distancing, provide source for, even did, wouldn’t issue masks themselves. provide compelling case masks effective all. fucking hate wearing mask. hot uncomfortabl

I wear 3M N95s go gym full 1 hour workout, feel lack breath whatsoever, air even feel fresher filtered. Dunno about. Well see running info MSNBC 5 months ago. 
You drank koolaide asked more
Trump never called Dem hoax. Seriously look up. 
Hydroxochlorqueen working great. Plenty studies it. extremely safe almost zero side effects. stupid look up. funny msm jumped right oh trump says good kill you? question anything take hyper partisan stance go ape shit everyone around agree narrative. 

Assisted virus? Give friggin break. According fauci 2 million would dead may. beat faucis estimate long long long shot. 

Also covid deaths revised due erroneous reporting... looked either.

P votes already going way. handful votes damn country mean anything anyway. Electoral college BS. No. [about would make shit internet? Lol

Tbh one worst things we've done country allow people like push narrative sizable minority anti mask really much fringe. Lmao

You think office workers monkeys people literally using ape strength imagine majority Americans believe same. minority vocal. Vietnam population 5 times America. male model looks like thinks stupidest thing world. you. Yeah, dunno... office people wearing masks walking hallways (security theatre). minute go office talk colleague small meeting, masks come off. think second wave indeed flu season/school reopening holidays peak second wave...won't thing. idea people think wearing mask means go around touch face, wash hands, hang group indoors zero risk infection. That's basically ""false sense security"" means. effective intended use, always conclusion replacement minimizing travel unnecessary trips precautions. effective, nothing effective staying home option to. using antigen tests PCR. proper thing do. Starvation, War, Genocide, extremly severe diseases like Plauge, STDs.

None thingw stop people fucking, frankly dont think anything can. EXACTLY thinking fact. live mandatory mask went straight mindset. bad. Sounds like Trump building Ironman suit loses election finish job destroying America. bottom half face ugly half I'm upset Yeah reason agenda begin low intelligence poor reading skills still testing contact tracing *entire* time vaccine.

and ready localized lockdowns time see cases re-emerge.

or else yes, get places europe getting right now

I think chinese &amp; new zealand models showing effective. how... Finland 13 deaths last 89 days. Sweden 16 deaths last 12 days. Even accounting population, Finland averaged 0.27 deaths per day nearly three months, Sweden averaged 5.09 deaths per day period - 18 times higher.

Sure, Sweden's numbers much better disaster earlier year, ""not great"" perfectly reasonable description comparative death toll. Hoping this. 

While gyms back open Nova Scoita people wear masks inside gyms

I feel like outcast would thought tbh. Keyword: MAJORITY

There still people always people refuse mask love Canada we're told national pastime. Indeed Thanks sharing link! plan want. can't make provide candy children. Infection rates going area, colleagues, friends, going less again, getting less take out, ect, good local businesses. But, value health do. people ignoring restrictions harm good long run. short sighted see it. Much chagrin “we live like Redditors” crowd, safety protocols work. many (not all) normal activities careful precautions. *'Tis scratch* work grocery store see lot people throughout day, shitty masks starting pop up. lot, increasing hope dont catch on. shoot virus. That's good trick. secret army people going around coughing other's mouth li🅱️s.

it's secret.

they're still *publicly* calling virus hoax many cases, ffs Would love hear theory one This, almost every store small town Alabama. acting like government perfect knowledge needed kind deception end arbitrary goal. goal really matters getting point safe enough resume normal activity levels, one knows exactly would take. surprise plans changed time learned worked didn't. 

For example ""15 days slow spread"" something came really know much all, still optimism could resolved quickly. clear pretty quickly going easy deal this, different plans made. think that's really ""moving goalposts""; something work well, really think keep saying thing anyway?

Are okay complicit murder/assault? that's waiver include get sick continue life normal. there's mandatory mask mandate would calling health services do? believe met school since went double date friends school. would ask wife. care long lasting relationship. teens fun. But, would expect understand that. 🤷 gym tried take tempture. told nazi shove little gun anywhere wants. Froze account gym stops trying violate medical privacy COVID treat ? Treats serving COVID? exhalation valve. filter, lets breath unimpeded. Cmon! saying statement “early April” false since 8th / 15th? edited please you.

And yes, deaths decreased slowly, like many countries hit hard, discussion trend super stable clear. 

What “pretty clear pattern”? fact small increase confirmed cases week 38. It’s worrying sure, definitely “clear pattern”. That’s something completely different. Like pattern seen France Spain. 

Look, I’m saying Sweden won’t get “second wave”. data right doesn’t support It’s enough time yet. Science hard you, isn’t it. Sweden also couldnt even arsed spend money save lives. seeing lot masks Vancouver. Maybe 30%, improvement, still... Ok seriously get propagandist fed bs. you’re actually believing message boo hoo personal freedoms wahhhhh omg it’ll kill missed health screenings, you’re clowning right?! 

No deaths ok. don’t care one child young person died covid, one many. 28 year old obgyn resident died COVID work ER help. That’s ok. isn’t .124% data point. young physician beginning career life. say may obgyn contribute cure female cancers?! won’t know according she’s minimal data point! mindset killing us. 

You can’t go numb Trump admin wants. want reopen without plan (I reopening done plan safely certain federal mandates place). want us normalize mass deaths carry it’s ok, isn’t. 

First world nations around world crushed virus...Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, etc name few. lives mostly back normal proper regulations put place. 

And case haven’t noticed......the economy already dead. People act like magical huge reopening make financial loss. won’t. took YEARS recover 2008 financial crisis. longer market fallout COVID. 

The longer Trump plays human lives fucks up, less stable US internationally domestically. lagging behind first world nations, means countries likes China Russia take advantage strategically target land water grabs suffer unnecessarily lack leadership, point clearly intentional Trump’s part. That's now, possible one ""mild"" coronaviruses causes cold descended virus caused devastating pandemic 19th exact argument made US compared places like Taiwan Hong Kong (intentionally leaving mainland China this). Population density. Surely won’t affected population isn’t nearly dense.

The argument made people Florida saw New York getting hit hard. virus confidently working way rural America.

To think somehow wouldn’t find way spread rural parts Canada, given opportunity unchecked viral spread US, naive. Fuck civic. 

#It's human duty okay? canadian man gonna move pay college ubc, care Doubtful I'm talking condensed homeless. I'm that. want like spreadout homeless preferably church adjacent small population homeless. like million churches America. oftentimes wealthy areas enough people help.

Not like homeless crammed together pass criminal experience Canadian scared number people live screaming constitutional rights violated. even fucking constitution rofl That's shitty defeatist way look things. virus animal reservoirs, strategy 100% effective end spread. long people interact, virus spreads.

You also run fatigue issue, following vaccination hospital case's deaths virtually disappear. well think lockdown point go general public?  saw happened toilet paper back March. Make delivery service majority, nearly 9\* 10 majority.

87% people.

21% said ""my rights"".

Interesting there's overlap ""civic duty"" ""personal freedoms"". Ah well. western economies totally inflated government subsidies right now. others. looking quarterly GDP numbers helpful. 

The real issues start it’s time repay debts tax increases slashing benefits. Sweden restrictions recommendations since March 

In whole ""summer"" thing... definitely change behaviour. There's one downtoen St Paul 5 year old came home Monday saying teacher wore face shield classroom worried getting ""corono"". asked repeat exact thing teacher next time. Hopefully conjure little bit tears drive point across. 

I know bit manipulative, sometimes destroy ignorance cuteness. Well know asking case two occasions Toronto time bus another time public locker room guys talking loudly (Asian people) wanted there, taking jobs space, even speak English (perhaps explained felt could talk freely loudly?), wanted punch hurt us break glasses (bc Asian wear glasses...didn't matter us wearing any, whatevs). parents told stay silent say anything, probably big reason anti-Asian discrimination still taboo. brother felt kind paralyzed, basically waiting stop go away. whispering, public, bus basically packed front everyone. Nobody said anything. happened twice span week. 


It's racial. experiences people general Vancouver good. People came across rude uncivilized regardless race, worth find Asian Americans (US) polite Asian Canadians well. found Asian people Vancouver condescending. I'm willing chalk maybe BC Toronto large metropolitan areas live not-so-populated area US. Maybe simply assholes big cities? Raytheon papa, promise! get one .000001% loans $2,000,000. I'm sure find *someway* pay back. forgotten times. Nowhere around mandatory, strongly recomended. Feels like dick hanging though go without one. STDs didn't, think safe say disease will. vote annex Vermont. great beers there. also look ""Scammers made $145 Million dollars Covid? Nobody ever looks scammers... /S Turn music down, can't see.... rely one expert, consensus expert opinion. People able wrong, still maintaining knowledge expertise. Hopefully, admit wrong criticism attitudes toward mistakes often make people entrench beliefs regardless evidence. social problem. vaccines far one greatest achievements society.

You iron lung rest life? Sure, reasonable interpretation words. local mall Philippines also Sri Lanka guards.

America, fuck. island. New Zealand island. Let say again, NEW ZEALAND ISLAND. Let help more, Australia might ""continent"" people live one side could fit state Wyoming room spare. islands 5 times population Australia New Zealand combined. Japan 41% larger New Zealand, population almost 50 fold. New Zealand shutting import/export anybody actually tangible. 

It would like locking New York City, except New York twice population New Zealand island enforce traversing. Texas population Australia, continent, basically big ass island wastelands everywhere coast. Comparing anything well island western democracies handle virus population several cities dozens countries dumb. Inside outside? Big difference. Unfortunately, agree you.

All know get series vaccine shots, done quarantine shit. I'll still wear mask state California asks too, team player, sitting condo another year vaccine out. BMI good metric people work since muscle 4x heavier fat. Someone weight trains body fat less 10% easily classified overweight obese based BMI. Yep, I've probably flu handful times life recently twice within last 3 years much days. bad actually went doctor get medication, cold store bought strepsils Vicks enough. Lol, go literally every thread Sweden spouting bullshit? Give rest obsession. problem wearing mask  reasonable  arguing becomes issue personal freedom

Do wear pants outside? others young healthy choose accept risk get back normal. 


It's decision. societies decision based health expert input live society. welcome go live hermit woods like societies rules. 🤷 Are.. serious? even looked contact tracing data governments released??? Covid clusters overwhelmingly originating contained within 4 places: nursing/longterm care homes, homeless shelters, construction job sites, prisons/jails. timmies? that’s requirement number 1. Thanks apologies stranger!

No worries, better safe sorry. info works doesn't, better.  people large really really stupid. done lied masks. propensity lie exposed, like, I'll listen necessarily believe.    
I've suspecting aerosols along nursing home situation.        
Since we're left guess, part withdrawing guidance might related liability. say aerosols present, almost becomes ""best practice"" deal means air disinfecting. business could sued.  following ""best practices"" opens business punitive damages. That's why, right current guidance, think running business without requiring mask wearing. basic, can't point science book backs claim. Again, claim is: **BECAUSE** many people got virus impossible eradicate. Please show basic science book says pandemic illnesses impossible eradicate.

Democrats failed bring key economic demands first CARES Act. Namely, parties allocated pay furloughed employees paychecks like Europe. took McConnell word would second. course, McConnell's word somewhere Dark Matter non existent chin. 


The good thing brought CARES act carried popular support $600 plus up. leverage is. fail get that, really nothing brag working class Americans about. 


The Democrats willing exchange $600 plus immunity. experiencing pressure compromise too. They've already came $3 trillion. 

I think immunity come 2021. Economy dumpster fire. parties operating shut never reoccur. So, businesses exist, must exempted sued Oblivion inevitable happens. 

You choose work commerce, infection. world live America. don’t think Russian money laundering industry going suffer badly first wave hit load old people's homes, exacerbated fact sent load old people back hospital start pandemic.

The current wave mainly hitting younger people moment. spreads older people, death rate go again. many viruses managed eradicate, spoiler small list. Eradication incredibly difficult could take years. social distancing, lockdowns etc next 5/ 10 years?  Ya carbon filter behind it.

How 90% useless? Majority canadians brainwashed cucks. least I'm at, people angry belligerent wearing masks. full state mandated here, businesses require it, yet, people still assholes it. colored perception would like everywhere else. Let’s see sources civic suit? Honda? Sorry. linguistic ship sailed. Fortunately solutions.

I hate celery. bother celery exists.

Whereas: ""The good fascist dead fascist."" flu never killed 28 year-old. fact Sweden consistent strategy start together fact currently seeing less spread Europe **very reason** optimism. 

If would yo-yo-approach UK Israel, ow numbers would equally positive. UAlbany 150 positive cases lmao. Learn basic facts. Ah followed strategy Sweden. Got it. Stop spreading disease around world then, everyone else trying stop it. America democracy, want might matter. face shields alone protect anyone. Save mouth droplets- anything either party. airborne virus. getting vaccinated once. Rates fall immediately, even successful vaccine.

Restrictions slowly ease people get vaccinated cause rates fall. includes rates death hospitalizations also fall semi effective vaccine. nothing restrictions. Larger larger groups sliwly allowed. need get back normal vaccine induced herd immunity. Even semi successful vaccine need high rates vaccination show effect.

A non protective vaccine, however, unlikely get approval anytime soon. Efficacy measured preventing disease. Proving vaccine reduces severity would take much longer would actually need people sick show statistically significant result would need wait disease ran course them, plus effects. yeah 10 years older am. it’s bad killin throat. ibuprofen pretty much makes feel like i’m normal. glad okay though! Compared neighbours lot worse, way deaths neighbours combined many people wear masks still see people everywhere wearing properly around chin distancing. Seems like people use ticket entry mask-mandatory spaces. surprising many provinces seeing 2nd waves.

Are saying reason 80-90% native americans died disease imported europeans weaker you?

Funnily enough, history proves right. Bones ground shows clearly elderly weakened individuals die first, tend survives. next layer dead people act doctors/caretakers culture, finally everybody else *until left social distance enforced nature*. 

It amazing many times people told lied cloudy fear mass panic without people starting think themselves. 

Gaining immunity new disease naturally, takes 300-400 years. case noticed, means generational inheritance immunity reactions survive natural selection desired results become possible. 

But good luck you, mentioned many times: *Nature* humane, going humane behalf. It’s civic duty Americans seem lack.... Ok, this? kind political discussion meant another sub. daily cases too. immediately threw efforts done contain virus lockdown window. Today's Herman Cain Award goes to... fact unreasonable interpretation.

America. AKA “fuck you, mine!” saw someone taken face shield, turned upside (so they're wearing around neck) CUT LITTLE BIT MOUTH AREA.

I'm like ""Honey, ain't protecting shit.""

Edit: Something like home-made, barely covering mouth nose, seal skin. also funny separates earning power 40%  reply weekly survey MSB many people continue follow restrictions range 85-90% months now. I’m scared mask requirements persist long past point. clear, understand masks necessary I’m favor *years* mask requirements, vaccine, whether vaccinating vulnerable vaccinating everyone wants one. Well ask nicely. Fall though, see people wearing masks. least people Minnesota wear masks, thinks. Study Confirms Social Distancing Effective Intervention COVID-19 reduce spread people close contact, close contact number 1. since day 1. can't believe still even discussed. kids, would never listen community people calling father dumbass days death. makes skeptics.

If kids still skeptical diseases existence killed father slowly painfully several weeks think one subreddit gonna change minds, regardless polite community is. must one people insane standards mentioned. know that. People assuming that. data continues come becomes unrealistic. many cases going undiagnosed early on, 7 million confirmed US cases, puts US cases Coronavirus, minimum, ~75 million. words nearly 20% entire country get coronavirus. Epidemiologists estimated need 60% - 70% infection rate mostly stop spreading people already infected. point infections linear instead exponential.

So true, means coronavirus nearly vaccine unnecessary. rate current active known infections assessed infections, hit ~40% mere months point number new cases plummet low levels even chose reopen everything. hit 60% 70% around October next year. Total deaths 600k less. Excess deaths around 800k.

It'll tragic, point run virus going 100% vaccine would become pointless.

BUT

I believe we've 75m cases. believe far, far lower that. I'd put estimates closer 10m personally, admit could way base 10m estimate. know 8x level extremely high unrealistic. assume accurate reopening country right now. I'd call dumbass still breathing I'm sure dumbassery would contribute anyone else's skepticism unless suffer similar condition. also suggesting wear masks sex.


I dont think fit job, works paper doesnt work reality. Show chart average deaths like 10 20 years ask there's massive spike 2020 Polio proves point. eradicate vaccination made non issue. covid vaccine eradicate it, however make possible go back normal.

The idea social distancing vaccine eradicate virus nonsense. will. Stay safe.  SG truly sorry would resigned post. That's someone moral compass would done. culpable deaths tens thousands Americans deserve put trial crimes humanity. 


Unpopular opinion since everyone seems celebrate Fauci, he's culpable guilty eyes. stood trump said crazy shit merely half assed smirking face palm man stood moron bully trump day one. excuses trying minimize damage. people failed nation resign face punishment. knew coming lied lied lied. think start coming clean without personal consequences. Fuck that. proof assertion? get tested monthly, month ago someone tested positive 700 people got tested 5 times month make sure one got infected them. around 35,000 tests one positive. Talk skewing numbers. Well see next month guess. Horray Halifax! Studied SMU, would love visit place. How've winters last couple years?

Any luck Busker festival year pretty much nixed?

Any Either vaccine optional, case people take risk getting sick rest us return normal.

Or vaccine mandatory administered vaccine police. people refuse I’m sure make isolation camps them.  Summer vacation July Sweden. ICU cases deaths started dropping early April. continued drop ever since. Quite steadily. 

Are suggesting drop since April due *one* summer month July? I’m following you. comes next year. fallout understood 5 years. scientist investigating new trending drug crisis draws line back 2020. no, frame like can't afford it.

frame like government systematically keeping them, happening. income nothing Nope, it'll probably even increase things go back normal. Haha idk trudeau made easy get relief money majority people could go back work didnt making money government. think canada handled way made look nice possible we'll see country long run Yeah crazy, currently 27th confirmed cases per capita EU+EEA last 14 days. Finland, Latvia, Lichtenstein Cyprus fewer it, happened it? don’t think Americans even know “civic duty” means.  extreme example Russia fall Soviet Union. US sent ""help"" economy Bush Sr. office time GOP sent members Federalist Society along corrupted Wall Street went told fire sale all.

And that's Russia did. sold state assets stupid prices bought Millionaires, ex-military ex-KGB members became Billionaires overnight. Russia ruled Putin, Putin serves cadre corrupt Billionaires called Russian Oligarchs control 99% Russia's economy much division post-Soviet assets Eastern Europe. Majority United States citizens even know Civic Duty means quite unexpectedly like wearing mask. feel like safe snug I'm freakishly paranoid around people. also really insecure face covering half makes feel much less anxious. really thought going like it. Man, wish could amplify idea.


They say vaccine gets rolled risk populations people like hospital workers. 


Politicians might well rolled that. Politicians take vaccine first foremost. *For safety progress nation, course.* true. Canada like US, without racism, homophobia free healthcare! Wait one ""Oh bless your/his/her heart.""

I want one. fairy tale. ....please cursory google DeJoy position corrupt, postage given priority postage right Bruh... it’s like we’re gonna meet settle makes hard go it. Everyone talks polio small pox took years eradicate. years, didn’t really see excessive restrictions mandates. something people lived worked towards.

And face it...covid’s fairly low death rate actually works us. virus liquified people’s organs 80% cases would sure shit lot easier contain eliminate. Los Angeles cities need affordable housing. feel like problem could solve itself. I’m fairly left leaning, even acknowledge giving poor people housing nice areas hampers areas too. tired talking masks. Move on. Get life Another boomer wants younger generation follow 'new normal'

I'll follow dead body. That's nice national subreddit got there. It'd real shame bunch alt-right fuckwits came took over. I’m saying doesn’t play role, think lower population density continually made people over-confident careless taking precautions.

Hopefully guys won’t get bad us. Thankfully govt seems little bit top things. talk name one authors story? Warren S. Warren. parents mean? Americans WISH Yeah absolutely. I’m saying release restrictions soon first person gets shot. feel like people media along people advocating keeping current measures virus would somehow eradicated, massive shifting goal posts also possible. I’m saying end goal vaccination, even partially effective vaccine, must lifting restrictions, whether takes full year week. 

Also, make good point protective vaccines. Hadn’t thought that. Wouldn’t possible though, theory, vaccine protective sterilizing, depending recipient? works sterilizing works well, protective doesn’t? two fully separate mechanisms?  people ignore rules responsible misery death others. like celebrating death terrorist. I'm joining pragmatically, society benefits longer danger others, especially seem options. Pew research pegs [85% uh,

why everyone overreacting lmao. Super easy still producing masks shortage, even background conversation. subtext ""don't make people panic quietly sell stocks."" city think. Sitting office (critical function job) hoping coworkers kids bringing workplace. assume wear mask 12 hours? 


If customers social distancing like be, shop staff wearing affect them. 


But since restrictions loosened see customers leaning staff, lowering masks speak standing within inches rather saying excuse me. 


This change make little difference making BoJo seem like he's something. Normally would BMI is, according CDC ""[not diagnostic body fatness health talking virus talking population, original intended use BMI.

LA like this??? Sure. didn’t affect trend. aggregate level, people seem behaved. 

There loads people sub saying “vacation bring COVID-19 hell Sweden”, didn’t people explained low numbers “that’s went vacation”. 

We 5-7 weeks away vacation period, schools started long time ago, currently seeing blip trend graph. Hopefully, trend stay, become little complacent, hell could return us. im ontario ive seen 1 person indoors without mask all. seen covering nose though frustrating. far people wearing properly here. Nailed it. without pretentious tone, and/or finger pointing that's happening posts I've read here. didn’t deserve decline

What horrible thing say went BikeZone last week none employees wore masks. Home Depot employees around chins really think major leaders involved vaccine testing.

Especially push fast risk health individuals humanity whole. getting hand. I'm tired everything know everything changed covid. won't. People banging strangers human history. going stop it. seeing lot polio cases?

From understanding, north bay hit pretty hard even month since air quality started bad city. go. Again, ask, ""gold standard"" measure, many countries use different limits?

There meta analysis 51 different studies ""on effectiveness physical interventions interrupt reduce spread respiratory viruses.""(Tom Jefferson, Ruth Foxlee, Chris Del Mar, Liz Dooley, Eliana Ferroni, Bill Hewak, Adi Prabhala, Sree Nair, Alex Rivetti, “Physical interventions interrupt reduce spread respiratory viruses: systematic review”, BMJ. 2008 Jan 12; 336(7635): showed:

Authors unable find clinical studies: “We unable identify randomized controlled trials listed social distancing measures”
Overall, systematic reviews suggested social distancing measures could effective interventions reduce transmission mitigate impact influenza pandemic. However, evidence base measures derived largely observational studies simulation studies; thus, overall quality evidence relatively low.

This study looked 65 studies workplace closures reduction spread influenza. (Ahmed, F., Zviedrite, N. &amp; Uzicanin, A. Effectiveness workplace social distancing measures reducing influenza transmission: systematic review. BMC Public Health 18, 518 (2018). found:

The 6' limit? old requirement (and actually still recommendation) three feet, based tuberculosis study 1934. six foot distance comes 2003 study one flight Hong Kong 8 people within three rows someone known SARS came illness. Covid caused death. 

People don’t die cancer, (generally speaking..) die complications.

My mother didn’t die cancer - although fought nearly decade. died kidney failure. Guess death certificate says cause?
Not cancer.

If Covid cancer could lived extra months years.

It might matter you, everyone else whose lost family cancer via illnesses, registered nurse whose around death time. time precious fuck trying trivialise it. I'm really glad read this. one pessimistic ppl (and frank, I'm still pessimistic season finishing), I'm thrilled wrong.


I wish wrong back like February, I'm glad wrong now. Bazinga /s is? No. don't. Lots colleges closing Thanksgiving week I've seen. think know people going invite others over. Even 10% Americans could pretty big effects. So, basically, can't know many people died covid certain day after, say, 1 week? (I know long take confirm dead)

Jesus Christ... would really seem Spain perfect storm pandemic government elected. side could better tho, but... fucking everything astoundingly? clue ""celebrities"" are. know care money people dying. indeed irony.. one trolling you. said two things sounded contradictory. Might intent that’s people interpreted it. 

When one person misunderstands saying blamed reader’s comprehension skills. everyone misunderstands saying it’s communicator. suprised too. lot people dont like masks really loud. America really good lot places. saw something similar except shaped like duck bill appeared closed around face. Either way creepy looking. Darn, would’ve hoped per-table ventilation typically seen KBBQ joints would help reduce spread virus. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* They're absolutely right penalties wearing little sister grew Florida, went UF undergrad Master's. ever seen snow life. went Cornell PhD work. say shock system understatement.

She's 10 years living Boston, guess cold scare off. Plus followed professor Harvard postdoc, met husband, liked living Boston. Hey get facts. care yelling ""USA BAD"" narratives here! advice obviously aimed people actually tele-work use home workspace instead travelling. 

And someone actually ""actual labour"" (loading/unloading delivery driving mainly); sod shit. Firstly ""desk jockeys"" solid chunk reason manual workers actually jobs smoothly. 

And secondly - short sighted realise asking work home helps protect us can't too? Less people pavements public transport means less vectors threatening us we're still travel. 

Think one step ahead running mouth. believe people wear mask everywhere feel necessary to. don’t support mandatory mask wearing. going sign says.  “Your parents don’t love you. want die?” enjoy two things trying comment: Trying tie criticizing US response virus big dumb librul, trying pretend Canada's increasing cases anywhere comparable country whose daily cases consistently 40-200x high. Remember sub said season wasn’t happening? Good team staying safe thus far fans getting form entertainment shitty times. Carson Wentz would stop overthrowing receivers, things would better. So, I’ve gone office (Solo) home since March. local AMC open, surprisingly, option someone buy theatre party, outside patrons. I’ve thought first showing day, whenever is, possibly parents, we’ll buy snacks bring home keep masks showing it’d 3 us. would 1 time thing it’s expensive-ish, it’d nice get out. Movies thing used time it’s completely stripped me. 

We’ve super strict continue be, theoretically seems like safe way something fun doubts. thoughts? understanding wearing mask first foremost protection, wearing face shield **and mask** even better.

A face shield supplement mask, replacement. seriously flawed, assumes R(t) 1.1 translates 10% growth *per day*. Yes, I've checked math.

Each covid patient ill roughly 2-5 days pre-symptomatic, 2-5 days symptomatic mild cases, maybe another 2-5 days infectious, fading even severe cases (i.e., infection generally defeated symptoms linger). end typical time infectiousness something like 10 days.

So ""days"" actually perhaps week ten days. Yes, eventually would get levels within population, would see herd immunity behavioral changes kick in. Right. far there's every reason believe induce protective immunity. Thus turning deadly doom virus cold. Writing Spain : people quick blame governments ineptitude ( hate Spain's death) , opinion individuals careless. I've writing sub lot everyone cheering Spain I've voted hell, people irresponsible that's truth it, irresponsible lockdown even pretty much everyone directly affected (and tragic consequences) virus go business like COVID exist. Must nice! Difference sweden done anything different since least april. Possible 6 months. depends many idiots are. idiots longer it'll take. people cannot grasp fact everyone worked together things wod recover faster. Anything excited voice amazing kids they're old enough roll eyes. Getting levels low enough normalcy. Yup, one first things bought box masks.

I grabbed 5 place every area might be. Car 1, Car 2, desk work, desk home, etc.

I spares + extras anyone forgot theirs. could speculate reasons it’s observable fact. Last month went expo line literally person wearing mask. Meanwhile Canada line 70-80% masks. imagine 25 people gathering party close contact other. 100 people shopping grocery store clustering way. 

At least that's suspect. argument I've seen crazies around (PA) attempt control free speech, patently absurd given we're middle goddamned pandemic. growth long time, factor herd immunity.

If assume 400k cases already (50,000 confirmed positive tests), population 8.57M, person infect:

* 1.1 people 95.3% population immunity = reproductive rate, particular herd (i.e., behavioral modifications pre-existing immunity) = 1.1542
* Therefore, social distancing brings reproductive rate naive population 1.1542, herd immunity reached R(t) = (1-(1/1.1542) population immune, i.e., 13.3%
* means cases peak 11 months, around 4,300 cases per day, declining almost nothing two years. still consider surge. Anything going zero big deal. They're two favorite sources too. two? Yup, live Montreal, amount people wearing masks wearing improperly pisses off. also work large place lot people, one person wearing masks. numbers going way back again, I'm terrified.  mask valve, filter exhale. that’s n95s Ok, talking theoretical vaccine 0 impact transmissibility large impact severity. 

In ways actually might worse reduction intervention perspective, circumstance, vaccine rolled (keep mind rolling vaccine going take long time get everyone population) actually protective population (though obviously treat risk first). 

Sterilizing vaccines would provide force multiplier effect restrictions have. 25% population vaccinated, removes large enough segment population (especially target front line people, people interact others most, etc) viral vector restrictions lifted pretty quickly (though fully). basically, people get vaccinated, restrictions lifted one time keeping R 1 (as above).

For vaccine protective sterilizing, can't actually remove restrictions feel like remove all. that? 50% population vaccinated, means 50% susceptible virus always been, remove restrictions virus turns back runaway freight train, sacrificed significant number lives. right number? say ""I'm cool sacrificing % unvaccinated's lives vaccine return normal""?

Basically, protective vaccines benefit receiver vaccine (fuck got mine!) sterilizing protect everyone society. Ideally based resources available contact trace level cooperation contact tracers. Things people appointed judge support. judge using disfunction created supporters justify even disfunction. Thanks insight! didn’t know education systems different. know - I'm glad live moment. Part problem done well people starting feel complacent (and opposition party capitalising economic losses purely electoral point scoring tourist industry - largely owned small number super-rich wants get back exploitative ways soon possible ). actually pain real COVID outbreak every chance throw away. Waaaaaah ... see here. People soft. 'Fucking hate'... Please. lol WRONG Well make good prosper evil get nothing? Yes, remember. back regulations, testing treatment.

Now anybody bad cold tested, life-saving treatments available, know manage isolation infected hospital patients. get seen N95s made Ford GM. think ""front loading"" deaths Sweden good idea knowing little virus, treat get sick, protect elderly homes, stocking PPE, making TTI strategies, so?

Sweden much lighter measures neighboring countries beginning.

This led higher spread much higher death count. sub become r/Politics - Virus Edition! waste time. He's one people can't think long term. correct. edit. calculation millions though :-) Sorry, specify. Shortage N95 masks medical professionals. 

Sources: enough difference neighbors banned travel sweden specifically still allowing among other. Sweden's success downplayed. rest world crippled gamble clearly pay sweden stands shining example everyone doing.  trade Canada? exchange, nuclear missiles want, lot BBQ, White House second time guess what? can't burn one down. Holy shit realize wearing mask stopped interacting people. Totally bro. Never, ever come here. Thanks :)

\*frolics beach waves\* US: lol conspiracy bro providing adequate rationale analysis - rather trying degrade response acting condescending. attempting civil discussion.

I understand aggregate demand, still providing analysis. way see it, increasing consumer spending form stimulus check results one three scenarios mentioned above, increase taxes create lower consumer spending future.

As low interest rates - aren’t sustainable long run.

I open DM response want hijack post - I’m hoping response informative less condescending.

Edit: unsure editing original response, rather replying? Like said - DMs open 100% schools. Flu seasons followed school calendar. Flaring kids went somewhere came back went school. least source got wrongness (and subreddit). 

Are really fucking stupid? believe anything long posted Reddit? mean belive headline read reddit? complete overkill.

Stomp gets hold (again). wait things bad need even tougher restrictions?  saw thing youtube weekend people made candy chute. think I'm gonna that... stuff already have. Tape couple long boxes together (I'll using triangular boxes ship set golf clubs in), position one end rungs ladder, use box stepstool lower end got good enough slope candy get stuck. also one door mats scream, I'll move away door use ""doorbell"" kids come way door. I'll prob make setup bit festive lights skeleton something. put something FFS nurse legit adult complaint. Exactly. pandemic great idea way view deaths causes, Cancer, Flu, Car accidents, Heart disease Ridiculous getting downvoted sensible.

You're asking people stay home forever avoid playing sports fun. saying masks big deal.

Anyways. Maybe 5 6 people feel incredibly uncomfortable masks walked spotted post. Lol Yeah, poors trains! /s Yeah. need US defend us from... (checks notes)... Americans enemies. we're getting married Halloween, call Hallowedding. Small group immediate family sister's backyard. sure happen trick treating, promised make sure good halloween. Got favorite candy bat pinata (which thought could take frustration on). Making treats, cake, alcoholic non-alcoholic cocktails, dancing, wearing masks.

I want think fun stuff kids. suggestions welcome!  remember happened March April? Deaths started week exploded. hours new guidance, Trump say head executive branch he's head FDA, approve vaccine comes across desk. better basic surgical masks anyway fit tighter face. almost imposible buy something non Chinese. literally live Canada less cases things OVER.

I mean... last comment literally acknowledged things ""over"" Canada Europe still strawmanning statement, time big caps, wonder many ""American liberals"" encountered actually made claim.

I consider liberal (I mean considered pretty conservative prior Trump era) can't help see US done terrible response. would much like Canada's 1/40th, 1/100th, times 1/209th case rate US. I'd like semblance actual real response, ya know? Probably level scarf still producing masks shortage

But walk Walmart buy several hundred masks right now. Target several places. 

Is shortage places? give claim requires verification.

I mean, I'm sorry like hearing this, participating debate (or figuring ideas merit-able aren't) requires awareness education regarding expected debating parties find source material.

If offends you, may SOUND harsh, offense irrelevant. I'm sorry inform this, we're discussing facts long-established process. I'm making rules go. Therefore nothing offended by. learned getting combined InfoScience/ComputerScience bachelor's degree, former research-oriented.

There's lot 100-level college research classes (or comparable information non-scholarly experts) available YouTube, information available local library, knowing find sources claims able judge validity source important you.

It's really tough topic grasp. would probably take 1 day gain fairly strong understanding. Unless dropped school 6th grade, I'm sure already made MLA/APA citations book reports before. concept. people basic high school education somewhat familiar expectations. I've seen enough people without masks concerned. glad live area high Asian population tbh people wear masks. high school required those. surprising? Taxes. goes education healthcare. Hence 20 IQ points. customers social distancing like be, shop staff wearing affect them. 

Maybe thing is, people wear masks effective are. point wearing them. 2nd wave schools. Pre covid flu seasons coincided school calendars. pre classify every start semester first week class major holiday super spreading event.  better equal surgical mask least? every restaurant outside seating NYC, lol. We're seeing Austin right now. Basically anything that's chain that's desirable part city (basically within highway loop) *really* struggling pay rent. That’s big oversimplification. Compared neighbours, real difference didn’t lock weeks did. it’s also debatable called lockdown all, since far lockdowns e.g. France Italy. Go CANADA!!! Hahahahahaha that's gold thank Thats hospital bills work... third party sign anything get treatment. think unconscious people people without family die without treatment? No. nordic countries much similar strategies people think. restrictions rely personal responsibility. Even though Norway example lockdown much similar Sweden Spain, Peru Australia example. basically locked people including children months. Norway never that. 

Dont understand ask though. Man first source gave showed people dying 6-8 weeks range went up. like gave another source consolidated multiple experts discussing 4-6 weeks clarified that's older source 

You can't handle wrong. I'm sure why. Financial devastation rich vs life devastation everyone. Much debate. false. doctor ran marathon mask tested blood oxygen levels. fine.  Maybe course Government, one Public Health, too. ELI5 Please thanks think political party anything answering yes ""Do want free money?""

Urm, no?

*flashes advertisement welfare queen caricatures*

*pockets money instead giving out* wonder vaccine actually work virus mutating like one public expected get vaccinated enough keep thing bay. need numerous vaccines per year...

Aren't expecting way much public? think Alamo may survive due fact they've spent time investing on-demand streaming service replace physical theaters well roadshow/drive-in screenings. They're currently re-open jurisdictions, knows long last. little Alamo clones popped over, though? Movie Tavern, Moviehouse, Studio Movie Grill, etc...not sure odds those.

As big boys, AMC looks like overextended could first go. backed Chinese firm, may choose cut losses run. We'll see. virus going go away lock 6-8 weks (except maybe island middle nowhere), best may delay cases, look argentina example, longest lockdown world right cases deaths exploding, know people reddit keep repeating obviously untrue passed 200,000 week half ago. I’m conspiracy theorist, think they’ve invoked kind national security wartime censorship process. We’re gaslit hard. Think administration, think wouldn’t something like that? Inside stores businesses people almost 100% compliant experience lately. I've home depot almost every day past week. see one person without mask. Painters covered paint, landscapers covered dirt , everyone.  
 honest, I'm close people I'm slipping mask down. example driving car myself. still see lots people wearing mask well social distance driving car road.  
Wear mask needs worn, people forgetting purpose understand for.  
edit: location GTA West (legit curious) view 250,000 excess deaths *so far* year? bad year dying excess? Canadians falling right Bill Gates' hands! know 5G waves track vaccine chips blood? /s small business owners employ people. founding basis union ""BS""

If tyranny majority wants sideline smaller states, voids basic founding principle union large states would checked smaller states condition smaller states agreeing enter union. New Hampshire equally state New York California. think states ""more equal"" others, perhaps smaller states leave union. I'm f*ing sick covid reporting using words ""apocalyptic"" ""apocalypse"". already bad enough world taking virus seriously, kind fear-mongering, panic-mongering buzzwords make deniers take less seriously, already anxious depressed covid-conscious people even mentally wrecked. preaching choir, completely untrustworthy time.

What shitstorm. I'm convinced better logical reporting people sides would inclined take thing seriously instead falling pure panic abject depression ""it's obviously overblown/a hoax"" mentality. Started admitted still alive. could money grab ill informed decision though. Contray title says, hospital likely would covered residents bill didnt would PR nightmare. doesnt really pay shes dead. Here's one example problem inducing panic hysteria: Minnesota's cold-storage ""PPE facility."" absolute unnecessary waste crowds spending things could helped amerliorate crisis. Maybe mask wearing good thing don’t want forced them? ""Very fragile, fragile. people say never seen ego fragile mine."" - probably Trump far I'm aware seasonal. here, time. Why? AKA enforced courtship. schools principal called saying cough ans nervous going school. 

I would rather die live debilitating conditions whole life. Getting breath walking downstairs seem like ideal way live. Denmark handled aspects better Sweden far, I'm *much*, ***much*** worried Sweden. son miss trick treating last year. sick boosters passed went. didn’t miss all. year doesn’t need boosters I’m planning hiding treat bags yard find... dark glow sticks bags Touché bet Trump stop pronto really not. unlikely get covid summer outbreaks southern hemisphere March/ April. Fauci meant respiratory illnesses spread winter combined flu. automated businesses grind halt.

Or they'll find new consumers emerging economies abroad reduce working class level indentured servants. Norway week didn’t see single person wearing mask public transport stores (I outside Oslo) stop 'majority ___ think x' headlines? doesnt give useful information all. bar news lot greater 50%, saying 'majority' neither informational interest provoking. virus mutating real haste, especially compared influenza. understand healthcare workers group 1, elderly group 2, non-healthcare essential workers group 3. Keep searching vaccine research trials area, best shot getting one early. It’s always understanding “ effective rate” ( like said) complete immune system suppression too, think we’ve known awhile goal turning covid-19’s effects lower respiratory develops problems upper respiratory infection. 

I think observational people known virus won’t like Measles vaccine eliminates existence, covid-19’s going exist us like corona virus’s do. don’t know fairytale thinking what, won’t eradicated, really doesn’t need we’re able protect vulnerable population vaccines. Honestly come 5 years time road people probably exist COVID-19 exists. battle over. point mandated places, enforced places, people either understand effective reaching anymore. point it’ll diminishing returns people get pissed literally smallest sacrifice anyone make. fucking selfish people think wearing piece cloth keep someone dying huge burden?  I'd hate see handle actual adversity. healthy amount population needs immunized happen promise supply short while. Expect mid late 2021 TBH. lot Americans refusing wear masks leaders implied lame

Source? Data? (What’s “a lot?”)

Lmao. Mask wearing never “cool,” regardless - it’s valid reason wear mask. Again, morons would take action based football coach. 😂 

Canada zero deaths one day doesn’t really prove much anything... could simply outlier, among potential issues “cases” reported/affirmed.

So, clear, tiny island New Zealand (outlier) Taiwan (another tiny territory China claims) better... chose extrapolate “every country USA mostly back normal?” 🤣 Idk live, many places America looking normal. never even way aware US horribly paying zero attention news 

Or see data shows dozens countries similar situation worse silo-ing paying attention partisan agenda driven news source.

😑 linked CBS Tribune opinion piece asked “sources/data.”  🤣 

The irony MSM narrative exactly you’ve gotten notion “Murica bad everywhere else better.” 🤦‍♀️ saw full staff mcdonalds wearing face shields (in Tokyo...) China's stats sort dubious too.  tell public officials numbers bad punished, numbers bad.  must sort law nature. East Coast family wear, because, know, Trudeau. swear, Cape Breton Canada's Alabama. regards family, is. symptoms. He's 28 years old.  Yeah don’t get “approved” category. Add surgical mask he’s damn near hazmat level protected sneeze guard hat isn’t helping anyone much. Dude I’m keeping real don’t think anyone takes arguments seriously Holy crap, near old hometown friend nurse right now. Shes saying work freaking crazy dont think going getting better cold weather.

All I'm asking source prove outlandish claim, stop obtuse show sources accept nothing, swear like talking flat earther.  mask rules relaxed vaccinated people muh freedums idiots immediately claim vaccinated stop wearing masks. People gotten vaccine yet due distribution issues issues bak exposed much higher rate, catch it. Hospitals fill again, ICus capacity people start dying preventable issues mass numbers.

People get vaccinated going get glowing vaccine halos, mask use still norm introduced. live near London, UKs response joke  Amazing propaganda works. School hasnt several countries, Sweden one example one im versed in. School normal ever since pandemic started without masks facial direct link southern region Swedens health care report, updated daily regards age. Vecka means week week year.

As see spread infection among 0-18 similar 70+ latter quarantined engaging people protections. 

The claim schools kids spreading infection unsubstantiated, since many countries havent schools open, countries hasnt seen claim materialize.

When look link above, keep mind Sweden hasnt closed, quarantined masked neither students teachers. age 0-18 kept operating usual karma. I'll use see fit. That’s what’s causing 2nd waves. Parties/ large gatherings, bars return school causing waves.  38.0 minute delay fetching comments.

I think would take alot swing dime quickly. think would sit hands find way seen. 


The military looking number kids going ineligible service whole Covid thing. last thing want Supress recruitment either minorities supporting Biden, white supremacists supporting Trump. how, exactly, make arguments less valid? Honestly, covid (medical professionals) told test flu much assume that’s have. Testing expensive unnecessary, isn’t really going change treatment plan. cure, treat symptoms, stay home rest/drink fluids.

They always tested people admitted hospital, quite often they’d prescribe Tamiflu showed within first couple days symptoms. worked urgent care, like 25 tests week, would test obvious symptoms, fever without explanation. tells need know.

You mastered shit disease. Oh absolutely, use living mums basement seeing anyone else think human interaction optional   country gives information deaths infections, times give data day. suppose worldometers give information covid infections known day last days.

Therefore, see 4000 new cases (or something like that) 10000 covid cases yesterday (a backlog days)

The thing countries give information say number got day.

Worldometers gives much information Spain briefly **10,799 new cases** **241 new deaths** 3125 cases already validated Ministry Health. Data provisional subject change. Sept. 16 onward (with exception Saturday, Sept. 19 Sunday, Sept. 20), figures daily new cases include cases already validated Ministry Health daily PDF report. Since validation process takes time complete, additional cases expected added retroactively weekly historical dataset revision released Ministry Health Friday, Sept. 25. Data Sept. 15 reflects latest release official ""Historical Series Cases Autonomous Community"" dataset released Ministry Health. 

Also, Spain federation works like one every 'Comunidad Autonoma' report, rythm see todays numbers new case Comunidad Valenciana, days happens Comunidades. also days increase infections deaths like last week Pais Vasco added something like 200 deaths couple days.

I hope enough! know spanish data difficult understand (even know spanish!) here. Republican state thank goodness. post wasn’t removed didn’t break rules. great day Even bots onto now, brilliant. people preaching stay home...probably get curbside pickup delivery ya know...a person...who stay home. dont though, provide form source admit nothing fear-mongering news headlines pseudo-science. get bored doom gloom merchant? Yeah hopefully make theaters safe again. like socially distant highfive fellow man.

Works everytime. literally don’t care fits agenda though. Funny mention polio, eradicated. We've ever managed eradicate smallpox took years work.

So again, want lockdowns social distancing years eradicate covid? trivial

It stops becoming trivial something affects consistently.

Your computer blue screening something trivial, happens dozen times day ""hate"" category things life. life fucking nightmare Hookah lounges typically decrease ventilation much possible let smokers blow O's stuff. http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/

This great visualization using John's Hopkins data. indeed rising again. contagious disease. Masks silver bullet, they're tool toolbelt. prevent spread, limit it. Nearly every first world country looks bad compared Estonia. Team Rocket blasts speed light! Guess see time worn properly. Every place I've in, proper mask worn properly entry. I've encountered one person fought mask yelled store owner. dont think anyone mentioned criminals New Zealand success worst thing possible US. everyone mind “if it, we!”

I’m sorry Wellington New Zealand international hub NYC is. Sweden isn’t exactly like Florida know. So, hiding indoors already then.

Yes, hundred deaths per day... along came summer...

The question is, much drop cases/deaths result change behaviour summer months? housing market near job collapses? consumer job ....


The Economy living life line government induced demand speak. Right now, people's Jobs supported Fed Loans Fed directly buying products suppliers. 


But, instead gave consumers $1,200, demand would accurately induced consumers FED officials. Fed officials trying pick slack consumers created. Meowth, that's name! *cries American* great comment, take internet point Economy tipping point too, lockdown collapse economy, drug abuse, mental illness also become much common. People want another lockdown see endless protests really lockdown again. use small caribiner Mask keep distance!

But manufacture spreadsheets something. Ontario well, went store today ~80 people seen group 3 without mask all, 2 unconnected people masks nose 2 together masks chin. Almost 10% properly... purely anecdotal course. nice see 90% part though. look comorbidities, 50% people who’ve died covid also influenza

Can point found data? seems unlikely right huge number covid deaths Northern hemisphere, flu infections March low, seems unlikely half people also influenza time.  is, gets thrown bus someone panicking constituents can't handle truth would panic.

Is reporting due kids tending milder case vs little spread? 

Travellers social people spread first initial wave follow normal seasonal patterns. past July august months school systems well. 

That data may changing schools resume. Okay cases still growing exponentially sooooo She’s pandemic outside lol Yep, 23 years lying media counting.  Americans: It’s communism oppression. taking away rights!

On bright side easily tell dumbasses now. literally put signs let us know. Well, points:

1. Humans social less true 60s, cities like St. Louis Detroit still collapsed barely begun recover. law nature says never happen Chicago (I think will, mind you, there's reason absolutely couldn't).
2. Even leaving aside complete collapse city, mean City Chicago institution go bankrupt/insolvent. Absent massive outside bailout, hard see happen point. Again, mean city go full Detroit, could result cuts city services simply make city worse place live while.

There lots voices opinions drowned these. Tam says face masks work. thought worked whole time. Glad came around Ok.

It isn't. strategy still containment. measures actually necessary prevent exponential spread.

Maybe r/assholegonewild I’ve seen Halloween planning ramp up. wait til Thanksgiving Christmas. 7 day average growth active cases US right 0.11%.

Growth rate factor look though considering US still seeing 30k+ cases per day 40k+ past US numbers looking promising right slowing growth rate.

It's growing despite high numbers 2 months. What's promising it? Americans need wear masks. Many Canada's provinces reduced cases much technically could get away without them, still wearing them.

Most Americans wearing masks.

In fact [we wear Canada. Canada one lowest rates make usage Canadians likely Americans praise government's handling COVID-19 keep hands public, less likely wear masks house, according recent polling data.


There pandemic mask criticized, can't knee-jerk 'FUCK YOU! USA! USA!' response, hey?

If criticisms based reality would one thing. Canadians particular seem chronically misinformed make critiques. think uneducated population earning power sustainable? Thank bringing up.

Yes, did.

The number deaths averaging 75-80 per day around May 7, began decline last weeks spring. we're first weeks Autumn numbers appear rise again. 11-12% seroprevalence back certainly 15% probably near 20% moment America learn something people..its ""rights"" fuck rights responsibility people around you,to family yourself. lockdown level impossible United States. people ignoring rules flaunting restrictions John street friends over..this 365million Americans spread diverse landscape.

well thanks man, glad that's solved. Ill pass information Giliead. exactly do. ur nobody wants fight you.  feel ashamed put pass in. stand fellow Americans refuse allow us controlled coerced. Mask use completely voluntary Wouldn’t want anyone panicking. Incoming ""Good news virus!"" comments 3...2...1... 30, yeah it’s probably true. I’ve best I’ve slipped times, case counts rising I’ve really decided stick 3-4 friends committed thing Look top health officials Netherlands saying, one many example. another quite balanced take prominent infectious disease expert frequently interviewed CNN NPR NYT. right cue. feed. top story. PuMP FEAR!!!!!! Trying gotta move first mean arent following Trump guidelines are: stick bottle looks like form injection slap white label it, pretend viable, safe vaccine.

The vaccine announcement going hear Trump another lie. equals ""uneducated"" according you, correct? Oh goodness. horrific site. pretty big lineup supporting controversial video pulled social media platforms. link article talking it.

I also tell first hand know nurses don’t believe mask wearing. work to. partner nursing school knows least couple.  simply pointing American liberals seem think pandemic over

I mean American liberals specifically? friends contacts worldwide political stripes know anyone thinks US done good job. fact, get pretty regular ""what hell country doing"" messages. Maybe person responded actually American liberal, irrelevant is, maybe exactly said doing.

The virus may ""over"" Europe Canada but, again, indisputable they've done much better job overall minimizing impact. told hydroxychloroquine...... exactly information think kept you? know kept kept you? called confirmation bias. leftists it. Small price pay stomp virus sooner. Maybe whole year, months post-vaccine least. want thing history books ASAP. Oh know it’s unreasonable. That’s said first place. Especially US economy, harsh lockdown won’t work. That's difficult question answer. Technically yes education ages 4-18.

Apprenticeships also count education people leave that, army jobs also count reason go college. think full time employment may also one I'm really sure.

I dropped levels twice. first time challenged renrolling straight away new academic year September 19 first years. dropped October 2019 showing college without making anything official (I 17 working 7.5 hour week cleaning job) never challenged save emails teachers asking was. largest one well funded colleges county, like small university. 

I know plenty people stopped going 16/17 never questioned seems can't officially leave education 18, definitely can.

If planning going university 16-18 levels Btecs critical. Technically take time want without going state run college private courses examinations level 3 qualifications pretty pricey, even local education authority grants. covid airborne, social distancing enough.

I'm Vancouver, masks mandatory public transit, take train bus see alarming amount people pull mask hang chin soon sit proceed mouth breathe everything. Yes currently however american active cases growing rate 0.06% meanwhile canadian active cases growing 4.95% (based rolling 7 day average taken today worldometers data) american numbers still much higher canadian numbers even looking per capita. Yesterdays per capita active cases 29x higher US vs Canada. 61x Aug 22. Dont look todays data look whats happened past week, 2 weeks, month, 2 months truely get scope things.

Canada headed dark path dont something soon. rather make small corrections rather drastic lockdowns month.  Still behind Canada. I'm wearing longer  rescind within hours. Nobody trusts FDA CDC anymore anyways. institutions destroyed politics.

The chance vaccine impact US gone due politics... I'm firmly pro-vaccine camp, admit I've never gotten flu shot. Medium sometimes low efficacy combined fact I've gotten flu two three times life (one times swine flu, lucky me) made really consider it. stay hell away people I'm sick, already kind hermit current workplace put close contact many others.

All said, think I'll go get year. Waiting tomorrow hear draft accidentally posted/leaked. /s think feel want, completely understand people feel hate. Hundreds thousands people *dead*. people clearly blame that. it’s Russians:) Going gym canada, ONE wears mask. still talk like doesnt exist. still fist bump saying bye. wear mask 24/7 gym dont take til leave. im one, wearing mask, BRINGING ONE. canadians dont even pretend wear one one near them. see shit talk US place idiots. Yeah right walk restaurant, sit table order food eat outside dining. open, serving food sit eat there. told it’s CDC web site longer? fear mongering. Reality happens tp bleak. Yeah going lot people terrified see still 10s thousands die years come. 10s thousands died flu....and wear masks everywhere half full restaurants that.  second enough people vaccinated numbers go low enough levels shit go back normal quickly. much pent demand go back normal going happen whether want not. really conspiracy theories dangerous, existence people lack education, critical thinking ability, psychological biases, etc, susceptible belief outlandish pap, dangerous. people afflicted absolutely horrific case confirmation bias.  political. Judge trump appointment. way he'd anything pro-precaution. guidelines? guideline says 15-30 kids pack classrooms day 5 days week? indoor dining fine long sit every table apart? private parties 10+ spread COVID, bars restaurants can't?

It's 8 month, already know works: either give let rip like US, go eradication full lockdown + blanket mass testing + border control. Canada's trying cake eat too. Sorry, harm arguing ""because wanna""? Seems like weak argument, hey, I. True. 
And u can’t breathe order online wear mask feels stupid stay home sniffles

Why though? That's exactly recommendation intention: ""Stanna hemma även om du bara känner dig lite förkyld."" 

You hovever get runny nose w/o underlying illness (up find out), maybe meant? posts reinfections actual reinfections? Nope Trump littered Judicial system enough Federal judges promote orange ignorance fuckery masses. Find couple like minded friends quit pandemic.

It easy do.

Just wear mask grocery store go back normal socially, much least. People peer pressure way killing chugging much alcohol, wear trendy fashions previously thought great, act certain way expect others want act way, etc. No, all. 

I guess still means something decided put higher numbers. never see stupid articles Sweden. Sweden people media never say over. foreign media pushes news.

But yet see lot Swedes mass downvoting anyone criticize articles claims. end day end goal reduce rate transmission 1 ongoing basis. lockdown initially stop/slow crazy spread get state contact tracing would help (though USA skipped part). that, re-openings theoretically supposed try re-open much possible maintaining 1 target. like math problem ""Start R 3. Subtract 0.5 closing schools. Subtract 0.6 closing bars restaurants. Subtract 0.5 mask mandate"" etc. problem was, idea numbers were, like ""subtract x"" ""Subtract y"". 

The fun caveat R value degrading go general without intervention burns populace (it's 6 reaches 70% suddenly 0, slowly degrade susceptible people burned through). 

Now vaccine, subtracting R value population vaccinated, happens, opening stuff keep rate infection close 1 possible (to give economy best chance survival). basically, keep easiest measures going longest (mask mandate, work home) getting rid damaging (depending are, bars, social bubbles, etc) quickly safely can. Conservative news outlets like Fox (most watched USA) issue per UPenn study. Facebook help. may understand drowning water like. pretty. lifelong sufferer severe asthma. someone gets pneumonia every year. suggestion CDC:

For every person who's experiencing heavy symptoms COVID 19. Physicians prescribe Advair. (Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS.)

I bet drug could save many people suffering COVID19 anything else that's used right now. Review success Western Australia “weird” happenings US- CDC. recorded got 200,000 deaths.

Also India discussed. 2nd US cases. Death rate 1000/day climbing. Government ordering private hospitals take patients paying care. Hospital system overwhelmed best times.

Netherlands- distancing rules children, testing children unless seriously ill. Doesn’t require masks.

Vaccine- oxford still suspended US, 2 British people transverse Myletis. One MS.

2 cases 8000 doses given.

Vaccine distribution - countries signed global distribution. China US yet joined program Yes, BC single-digit daily new cases while, crept double digits, we're regularly triple digits, surpassed peak first wave. that's bullshit people get bus home infect load people pass thus bunch people die acknowledge issues arise governing body much control seems necessary times like this. 

I sit admire countries taken bull horns got done. know ongoing struggles would sure nice live country isn’t seeing 1000s new cases day. Still mystery, couldn’t contact trace back quarantine (the likely source) couldn’t match genome previous cases quarantine cases (although genomes aren’t available them). Frozen freight still outside possibility. Thats Canadians lowest intelligence seem far smarter average American. &lt;~~ USAF Veteran think so. general I'd months ahead general media country sub.

But ain't anymore. Sorry. can't find now. saved shocked see it, given everything else he's said them. think I'm defending - SMH bureaucrats them, -- switch recommended them.   either completely ignore say something like ""Doctors purposely inflating deaths extra money.""

I've honestly given trying change people, genuinely worth energy. Uuuuugh thought me. bought new cloth mask thicker muffles speech little... guy counter pulled mask say ""what??"" lean closer. WTF. Elbow locker, might well wiped humanity. content wear mask ignore rest.

So going social distance instead go crowded areas stand close everyone?

I mean, think places remain shut really good point: they've giving guidance (gatherings 10 only! gatherings 20 only!) actually based anything. Ah, interesting! Kindergarten 12th grade legally required here. optionally go university college, say.

Is “16-18” legally required, optional critical step university? imagine employment situation similar here. best jobs typically require university education. pal wear mask, wants right given option wear it? Like knows wear health, wants know say ""fuck it"" suddenly feels like it. news story, standing line Metro. Like cashier going agree him. stressful waking person like this. I'd rather stay home defeated piece cloth. know people outside today. referring claim air bad since 6 weeks ago (which reached new covid peak), incorrect. know PurpleAir is, proper noun. scale air quailty maps goes purple highest.

But originally said bad air lasted week, responded ""Yeah air bad month before"" wasn't, air start bad city second week September. wrong please tell find information disprove that, linked air quailty tracker shows correct, arguing baout use term Purple takes away conversation. think good example using statistic county, peak April around 1 case per thousand people positive rate 13%. got cases lifted restrictions June, cases shot again. July, back 1/1000, time positive rate 3-4%.

What told time, back April way cases detected. positive rate going nearly 10% showed detecting much larger proportion cases, therefore despite similar numbers outbreak actually nearly bad July April. able feel bit secure handling outbreak decently even fewer restrictions, I'm sure that's lesson government took too.  Ya like less 4% population 70+. Turns die TB age 50 can’t die COVID age 75 saw originally way protest. “I gotta wear mask never said kind” important civic duty voting 60-70% eligible voters answer call. hold breath. Contact tracing never going work US way Asia. Laws culture make impossible. Yet reason people Montreal wear black middle summer darker shade invented yet.  haven’t really following angle it, speculation proof foreign governments involved driving COVID denying, anti-mask movement? love optimism we're going flu season now. Temps going people going spending time indoors now. saw 60k/day summer people spending time outside. Transmission rates shown lower outdoor settings easier social distance. People going stop partying getting together friends/family, instead going open area they'll inside homes. comment nothing Americas response coronavirus. simply pointing American liberals seem think pandemic Europe Canada they're country restrictions untrue.  I’m paying attention. You’re parroting sentiment reddit user base. Form opinions.

I’m talking covid, entire state union. Imagine marathon, participants sprinting. ""So far"", others might lead, they've also tired halfway mark, forgotten goal is, losing ground one bloke remembered sprint.

""So far"" meaningless dangerous measure one think ahead. Spanish flu ""eradicated"", like dinosaurs

No, wasn't. H1N1 influenza strain caused Spanish flu, also 2009 swine flu. still around. Saw dude day lace panties hanging nose. 3 4 Yeah make 7 million year probably good chunk savings. Using proportion compare specific scenario doesn’t work well joking well. Mostly. There’s lot like Canada!

Suck buy candy watch tv like good little babies! I'm Disappointed surprised. say *will* last 6 months, option needed. needed people can't simple tasks cover damn faces keep damn distance.  even fucking paying attention badly Trump completely gutted government.

I'm also huge Obama fan, he's practically Republican waffle-headed are.

I'm done. Later. Think might got numbers wrong there. I'm fairly certain Estonia 1,330,000,000 inhabitants. internet general lot better back then. fully exploited companies infected ads. never never big CS quake unreal tournament really endless content put people making maps mods. I've still got maps played. lot better companies decided stop supporting creators userbase could sell whatever made DLC Yes, part don’t get deniers / minimizers. explain many excess deaths? Died despair lockdowns?  Sweden's neighboring countries Finland, Denmark Norway, lock citizens, abandon democratic principles enforce police state?

Those usually countries Sweden compared against.

And course, infamous ""downvoting herd"" Swedish. Come on. obvious. Oh boy probably hasn’t wear one ~8 hours straight blazing heat \^This. exponential growth wave 2? Yes, coming. Well maybe u're lucky 80% you’re telling every team, players, coaching staffs, front office, team personal agents they’re keeping Covid positive results hidden, risking lives families friends themselves, play sport one leaking it. Interesting thought process say least. I'ma drop truth whether people want hear not:

In public people comply say care, second behind closed doors one I've met far gives fuck (I work job goes businesses) unless someone makes scene it.

Canadians love posturing good deeds, definitely live case. -10C amateur hour. goes -40C winter week long stretches. point, able return indoor activities. ICU/Hospitalization across board California. Spike SDSU 80 per day take per capita per 100k seems little blown news IMO. sold 1 million shares $3.12 billion earlier year total year he's sold 2 million stocks combined value $4 billion. nuke amazon share prices all. He'd need $3.65 billion year give away $10 million day. said, practicality example really point anyway. 

The point example absurdity all, Bezos giving away $3.65 billion year every year lives 111 years old still billionaire absurd. 

The gap laymen Sean Payton roughly $30 million. gap Sean Payton Jeff Bezos roughly $200 billion. They're far away Bezos difference statistically irrelevant. That's absurd Bezos wealth is. Maybe access 3% cause everyone dies lowering percent confirm place. Original claim 6-8 weeks, followed Harvard study showing 2-8 weeks asked source. Followed sources definitive claim 6-8 weeks. say things like ""up 6 weeks"" lag ""four, five, six weeks"". 

Then, can't find definitive source this, write old news longer treatments presumably get better. 

It's clearly known science, seeing can't find anything effectively support claim. issue virus unknown, people like taking opportunity make baseless claims. always ignore internet tells unless capable verifying claims primary sources yourself.

So advising check “primary sources” claim?, would find those? mean...this need know tell people STFU saying 10% deaths covid really covid. can't understand either really stupid really stubborn You’re acting like it’s entirely leadership. People dumb continue dumb. US Obama would fairly similar situation, maybe bit better. Idiots listen authority they’re trying save feel it’s impeding liberties. It’s fact. think baseball lax protocals, perhaps season started early pandemic. Perhaps, itll allow slight uptick jobs reports election, public belief beating disease make people happier current administration.  they're betting increased case load happen fast enough political ramifications election. took several weeks exploded last time.  time votes in. Here's would think people tested positive Covid second time would genetic sequencing.

Defend that. made declarative statement. Give source.

BTW, here's primer I'm talking Yale Center Genome Analysis working study two key areas COVID-19 genomic research. hurdle sequence genome virus itself, SARS-CoV-2, order track mutations virus. key focus explore genes infected patients. analysis used understand people get severe symptoms others, well as, help development new treatments future. studying coronavirus, identify unique genetic code,” said Shrikant Mane, director YCGA Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. “The genetic code actually say becoming ill, example, type illness types symptoms having, whether symptoms caused COVID-19 virus, human immune system group work includes sequencing virus’ genome itself. recently started receiving samples hospital patients order access virus’ DNA. According Mane, sequencing fairly straightforward, faced many technical challenges sequencing work part study Mane’s lab conducting, sponsored National Institutes Health. says hope collect 1,000 patient samples sequence SARS-CoV-2 genome them. type large scale work critical order map evolution virus. Pubs good economy. People sitting home isn't. Go figure. 7/94 

Not great 7/94 

Not great People need wearing full face shields eye protection MINIMUM, we’re really trying prevent transmission virus. He’s great! glad found channel MedCram’s back early days. two, two ones watch virus.  disagree. maybe live popping area. live East Hollywood moved area 3 weeks ago. I've shopping gathering new supplies home everyday seen nothing people abiding mask rules keeping distance. also work grocery store see people also following safety protocols there. exceptions occasional anti-masker makes self known mask shopping around, told must wear leave store, do. also commuting bus everyday always see people masked up. Hard keep distance though that's cause concern moment. that, feel like LA pretty well handling coronavirus safety measures. Hey, here’s 1.5 minutes research proves California isn’t reporting covid cases schools, fun learning something today! Lol high quality what? wrong sub. mean even get mild infection still get debilitating damage heart vascular system, lungs, nervous system. protection ending ICU seems useless prevention point view Here’s report found. bit old (2013) doubt things changed much.  # FOUND STAYING HOME GOOD ENVIRONMENT, PLEASE STAY HOME NEVER GO AGAIN. ^.^ Aye, least wearing all. normalizes wearing one all. probably wear right sometimes. even not, catch lot particles come mouth. yet see nose-only setup. Go nuts ask anyone dealing stress pandemic if, mind, ""the end first wave"" = adjusting shit things got height (or far height) first wave.

Rather things get back control.

That's said UK last month cases started rising 1k/day. 4k/day Yeah that's happens test people disease virus. it, number people said virus goes one Trust verify good principle. make sure wear masks anywhere everywhere, excuses? Japanese person 100% agree you. But, thinking loud, instance theater 'sterile' people start coming would help continually suppress virus? someone infected covid entering surrounding air person would potential keep suppressed much less infectious level? necessarily completely effective certainly effective defense add aresenal ( masks, distancing, etc.)? BIG TIME!!!!!!!! Show good science I’m happy that. Put candy individual bags tape clothespin string fence something. kids grab individual bags without touching ones.

Halloween one easiest holidays socially distance safely trick treating outside. don’t see reason behind trying cancel altogether could perfectly fine common sense modifications.

Or maybe hold event kids parade neighborhood (at safe distance) parents give candy end night?  right; lies misinformation falls alongside one half political spectrum, conveniently never part part of.

come on. precisely attitude led mistrust division begin with. school two confirmed cases last week. can't imagine many unconfirmed cases is, parents made right call pulled school first day.

I saw group 30 freshmen going McDonald's half masks. Thats group saw, school lets kids go property lunch mention every case “reinfection” far **different strains**. idea qualifies “reinfection.”

When get two strains flu one year other, reinfection? No. Er...ok. refreshing must something like sensible compassionate people majority. :/ responsible avoidable deaths? 
Just average human. perhaps decades worth divisiveness lying media resulted public mistrust; perhaps we're seeing chickens coming home roost. Week 37 still summer week 6 mid winter... UK gone back lockdown. Yet. Depends idiots usual. didn’t change thing. You’re one speculating making selective assumptions, apprently listening science that’s telling little known therefore caution recommended. ironic talk reality yet think virus gives two shits willing do. need stop comparing 1918 flu general. People forget WORLD WAR then. really changes dynamics  you’re conspiracy theorist, sure. Im sure understand exactly mean (or know Swedish) foreign media littered horrible clickbait articles goes ways. 

The news basically ""Sweden lock citizens up, abandon democratic principals enforce police state look, nobody died everybody died"" depending narrative trying push.

I try critizice both. eat nothing egg powder window salads I'd anorexic too. forgot once. late go back already started grabbing food getting handful things quickly. felt soooo dumb. Comment made Edmonton I’ve already commented, it’s experience. get panties twisted want, don’t go around denying substantial portion province heads asses store. purchase cookies. air...flying around.

Also life saving treatments advanced much since then. Treatments steroids help admitted hospital critically ill, could still end health disaster exponential growth results many hospital admissions. Yeah I’m GTA, call “the city” corner. correct. Wisconsin mask mandate since summer. extends it. talking about. school tested negative.

Awesome. almost china. Getting closer. Cable tv still 720p 

Good riddance Uhh... BLM protests? Continuing spam repeat bad news across multiple subs. post history cancerous.  It’s also ridiculous false economy. imploring people go back offices order to; buy fuel, keep city centre shops alive etc. However, part cash redistributed elsewhere, local cafes, shops, bars etc. full (in observation) . Britain living Mediterranean way.... long run (post covid) surely lifestyle better quality life. 

I say, let markets decide. Clearly covid expedited technological trends would happened next decade anyway. Let’s let future work, work now.  virus sorta good changed people's lifestyles exposed usual things would kill them? 

Well guess ""neutral"" good since kept status quo. Thank god. Wearing mask=""I care health people.""

Not wearing mask = ""I right kill people.""

Which want community?

I hope people start creating list folks speak masks pictures start distributing neighbors people know trust.  run bar. bylaws specific face coverings. Don’t wear proper mask leave run risk fine. People stupid. No. 

We want take care need use cost/benefit. always functioned way always will. 

Eugene Henrietta protect protect reasonably can. cannot destroy futures anymore it. wear mask live that, I’m pausing eduction losing income/facing eviction anymore it.

Remote eduction functional know it. Reduced capacity causing businesses rapidly loose revenue. mass scale. It’s disaster. COVID isnt setting back world, lockdowns are. 

This sustainable much longer. argh known thread would triggering

wtf wrong people thing get Suggest masked hike. Agree. wear KN95 though purchased reputable online retailer (not Amazon) know difficult distinguish real counterfeit.

Regardless, think better surgical masks know look for. Mostly thickness, layers, fit.

My strategy wear KN95 cloth mask get better fit/seal. I'm female standard KN95 access large, fits husband fine. masks, feel protected. love wearing two masks? really doable. nurses wear N95 shift, shopping. FFR

these KN95 know genetic twin - that's prove new infection.

But intents purposes, mutated, different strain Covid reinfection that's underlying disease circulating population later time. virus's mutations outstrip protective immunity, that's problem. huge problem subsequent infection combination mild rare, high degree cross-immunity.

You might arguing anyone could reasonably expect immune system that's possibly fair enough - flip side Covid evolving way can't expect immune system match.  thought idea something doesn't. mask helps prevent spreading it, much prevent catching it. shield turn helps prevent catching it, much prevent spreading it.

I could never really find data showing effectiveness used together think recurring theme throughout pandemic, folks trusted responsible/ right thing. scale 1 Michael Jackson, creepy would sat little apartment balcony costume bucket candy string, lowered trick-or-treaters passing could grab without get close?

Asking friend.  put simply spoon feed you? even internet know use search engine? We're too. we're stealing ideas Easter giving kids basket full Halloween stuff pumpkin hunt find little plastic pumpkins full candy around house. We're trying think anything makes fun memorable since can't go trick treating. use masks bus, removed eat, drink? sounds like kind excursion, pleasure trip? could infected meal times using masks. sure got voted. 

It’s like someone diabetes getting attacked bear blaming diabetes death Well that's sad still shortage those. Fake patriots think defending constitution wearing mask actuality abandoning patriotic duty protect family Americans. Great response, thanks. I’m aware I’m really able provide actual, real-life example kind vaccine talking about. Mostly lack expertise field, also might , said, purely theoretical point. 

There hasn’t really clear plan vaccine roll-out subsequent reduction restrictions communicated public. read experts saying vaccine *won’t* necessarily lead reductions, get somewhat worried tunnel vision road. main goal regulations continue containment Covid19 longer called for.

I realise might also tilting windmills here. It’s hard keep cool head times. US believe rights, responsibility.  I've gotten corona virus immune (such immunity certain, know), still pick virus spread others without getting sick myself? Thanks explaining   STEM important humanities.

Yes, is. need STEM keep society running. need doctors, nurses, engineers. Go look statistics college engineering programs. school thousands start maybe hundred graduate within 4 years. many people get basic foundation science/math high school. met countless people could finish computer science degree could pass calculus. complement one another.

No, don't. 

A poet history teacher never important society doctor engineer.  went tiny bit mostly keep climbing.

Not deaths hospitalizations. misunderstood, last month Canada line 70-80% mask usage, week 100% people wearing masks. I’m taking kids school pretty good sample trains.

In comparison, last month Expo line absolutely nobody wearing mask. haven’t expo line lately, don’t know it’s like right now.

Personally, think high concentration Asian people going Richmond normalized mask usage Canada line. don’t know it’s much “poors”. No, found article: FFRs filtration efficiency less 95% may actually provide superior filtration protection surgical procedure masks because, unlike face masks, properly fitting respirators closely conform seal wearer’s face, ensuring  air breathed filtered. example, FFR 80-90% filtration efficiency typically provide respiratory protection surgical procedure mask.

Thank :) Thank :)  Neville Chamberlain actually right thing hindsight though. France UK far able enter war due rearmament policies First World War. buy time. silly narrative continues widespread, wrong. cannot imagine like LTC right now, especially outbreak. 

We usually short too, initially going able normal amount people vacation summer due Connect Care training. Covid hit got delayed, people opportunity taking vacation. time since Feb sick getting swabbed. ahh yes excuse people go realise theyve said something factually incorrect always funny people make appeal nature there's nothing it. people usually ignore everything science unless directly benefits them. know people doubts China, country entirely closed off; we'd hear outbreaks level U.S. called KN95 instead N95？If KN95 mask can't meet filtration standard KN95, means qualified. criticising KN95 can't meet N95 standard kind weird. usually bundle up, turn lights, mix warm drinks, play scary music, sit outside give candy. could easily glove toss out. gaiter passes lighter/birthday candle test. basically way tell something safe. safe even though passes?

[Edit: found article says study gaiter wasn’t wholly accurate explains Interesting rationalized duty community, instead using common sense staying home/wearing mask protecting vulnerable. Slavery...? asked mouth breather? lockdowns want assume Eugene Henrietta world around 8 months gross.  That’s works know it. find them?  done February...... Yes. They're easily led morons. I'm taking note i'd literally rather die allowed leave house hour time.

The CDC's official site lists IFR people 50 0.02%. Look yourself. appropriate response? google even find 41 pensioners willing take risk travelling together bus? 
I barely dare go grocery store fifthees. mean... okay like something still continue it. people hate things. Big fucking deal, he's still wearing em. God. Sensitive people basically attitude anti-masker anti-vaxxer.

Like dang son, gangsta. perfectly good health comfort home, is. think they'll fare much better Sweden. spread Denmark mostly among younger people, already good routines protecting elderly homes know much treat get sick compared Sweden initial die off.

Besides that, using weeks Danish *infection* numbers order disregard overall success far, silly. works get light inside body. won’t though could get Parkinson’s isn’t really Covid?

smdh 😣 Lol lost one bud. Maybe Facebook little speed. understand difference cause death mechanism death misinterpreting purpose. According ""6%"" logic nobody actually died cancer brain hemorrhages, sepsis etc. know people spreading misinformation care truth defending cult leader. Instead pretending like everything go back normal, want actually reality, seriously wish people would follow guidelines would allow us safer around reduce virus’ ability spread. would allow us return activities faster currently - living roller coaster case explosions due people’s unwillingness adhere, leaving us without social contact all. someone side country desperately want know you’re talking Absolute vast majority Canadians totally brain dead. Good!  Let know regular non-rich, non-powerful Americans professional athletes get tested daily. nobody blame virus

Wow: interesting! lol! skins boned us enough already. total waste money different group people - anti-vaxxers - ones refusing take March April. limit effectiveness. Thank you!!! believe 60 minutes March 6 using cab resulting cretin? cases deaths started dropping early April. continued drop ever since. Quite steadily.

False... deadliest day Sweden April 15 (tied April 8) 110 deaths. average throughout April early May 75-80 deaths per day (80 deaths May 7). That's started decline. So, truth number deaths began decline towards end spring.

Now autumn began numbers appear increase. pretty clear pattern...

I expect numbers deaths reach highs early April however, simply treatments COVID-19 much effective (one reasons delaying cases long possible preferable Sweden did). Ummm bud. Calgary Edmonton first mask mandates country, vast majority people wearing masks. Nice try though, cunt. said never going back normal? course happen, unfortunately live half population wear mask. yea that's put hold, sure live assuming nature comment must rural area State get hit bad others.  You’re fucking moron dude. dudette. Sorry. shared ventilation systems spread everywhere...yeah, no. That’s *model-based study* clinical research.

Good point doesnt kill you, might initiate Parkinson's well? What's next? Exploding assholes? Oh wait, already one Washington. 3) people major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.)? husband want meals others' homes, think wise. I'm wondering handle even telling relatives in-laws. think even go all.

Had Americans handled better, extremely likely would completely normal now. late that, unfortunately, day another going confront inevitable fact might simply *be* holiday season year. 

That said, *still* need get act together, try best stamp virus every available opportunity. might little late successes comparable Wuhan's New Zealand's, *definitely* mean start throwing hands air giving up. Correct, ain't well Sun News consistently poor, especially amongst 25-54 year-old market desirable advertisers; least one prime-time Sun News show drew zero rating 25-54 demographic. I'm poor. know poor people. know they've sick despite telling COVID tests free, go in. Many insurance afraid losing little they've earned life.

The US worst modern healthcare system world, specifically punishes poor. Even free, nobody poor take risk part process free. many believe COVID test free, nothing else.

It California thing. unique US. California may different, know. I've noticed big shift Vancouver. Maybe one-two months ago, people skeptical masks thought rules apply them. transit ferry systems made masks mandatory, norm. see masks everywhere walking around almost frightening see somebody without one daughter date Saturday. cant communicate someone mask on, problem. Likewise. solid chance actually replying someone living Canada. Probably likely considering popular site is. it’s not. Crazy right? uhm, 241 deaths day. fact, todays deaths 21 (which obvioulsy wrong, tomorrow number change) 6, see daily deaths, said, trust 42 deaths yesterday 21 today, change. booked flight. anyone resources techniques convince family members (we Europe) pandemic real conspiracy ""control people"".

Thanks advance. no, somewhere 410 620. He's outside! would wear mask outside? wear mask 10 minutes, retail workers wear hours end. can't bear wear mask 2 hours, like fuck going wear one work. question people:

Oh aint second wave. Mark words. weather turns gonna bad.  read actual source Harvard.

I say every single death happens 6-8 weeks. said happen. actually read Harvard insulation information says said many posts ago, number climbs higher get away infection.

The deaths happen 6-8 weeks infection.

I provided France used country example yourself. Look country  topic creator makes topics reinfection ( might made least 20 topics today ). Usually posts headlines, full articles either unrelated headlines context entirely different. He/she claims there's agenda.

Most links also hidden behind paywalls, preventing reading whole thing argue narrative. Riiiigght.. Ar risk job loss, CDC chief, needs put cards table.

Every Saturday last 3 4 Saturdays, assholes anti-mask rally outside place. There's even stinking shit drags around speakers wagon microphone, yells government conspiracy. *cries Floridian* worthy note flu vaccine, far less likely hospitalized die get vaccinated still end getting flu. severity illness diminished even vaccine prevent illness. 

Hopefully see similar effect Covid vaccine, even 100% effective. Absolute idiot Surely debunked now? We're UK, mandatory everyone wear masks - they've actually passed law forcing it. Yet we're still seeing infection rate absolutely booming again. Exactly throughout Europe America shown absolutely evidence slow things there. 

They studied masks years pandemic evidence always flimsy best. became reminder anything else. 

If saw complete slow would totally believe you, truth we're seeing notable change rate infection without masks, point accurate. 

People point Asian countries proof - totally ignoring key things they're alongside masks far larger impact. 

It's weird people still act like silver bullet one knows little secret. sets enormous example

I don’t need football coaches influence medical opinions, moron country reason we're like country left world things [arent?] mostly back normal.

Oh, agree completely. Unfortunately everyone going see way. Face shields don’t trap aerosols. wasted study. Right are. stand corrected, we're awful used be. Thanks tip. Earlier pandemic read rec centres Edmonton distributed 1600 mask exemption cards. medical signature required, grab fake card rec centre. really 1600 people can't wear mask medical reasons, can't help wondering what's water there. bet bottom dollar bill you’ll see obverse again. Every chance get they’ll try keep economy afloat. yo-yo like wee yet. Saw customer wearing rhinestone covered loose fishnet mask couple weeks ago. walked away, manager looked one another completely defeated. prove **new infection**

Literally point. See didn’t use word “reinfection” right there? News reports follow standard.

They know average person aware two current strains Covid, use word make people think “immunity” completely impossible (as opposed conditionally impossible, much like flu), get lots clicks ad revenue so.

**Edit: fact, post created OP advertise substance abuse center.** See downvoted comments post history more.

In short: using word “reinfection” gets attention, objectively incorrect description. unlikely. Meanwhile NZ China lockdown hard first whiff outbreak weeks open almost normally. unfortunately i've seen lot people seem generally pro-mask still absolutely terrible wearing them. 

if take mask every time talk somebody, wear walking yourself, might well wear mask. Tedros said negative. Go watch video listen saying. stop headline.

**And quite jumping right workouts, start taking dogs big walks every day. actually quite lot published scholarly research shows walking dog every day effective antidepressant:** Source? claim assumptions many reinfections? Yeah I’m totally board here. lack knowledge concerning vaccines might somewhat apparent here, mostly trying oppose narrative widely distributed protective vaccine *not* warrant full release restrictions. 

There article r/Covid19 (yesterday?) authors stated (I’m though vaccine fully distributed, might drop infection rates want them, since vaccine might ultimately, some, protect severe disease stop shedding virus. Therefore, vaccine guaranteed put end restrictions. 

Stopping Covid19 intristic value it, stopping death disability has. dampen pandemic, effects infection, even ”bad flu season” levels, don’t see there’s argument restrictions. 

I realise specific article doesn’t concern specific argument, might somewhat topic here.

Edit: Here’s thread: would think people tested positive Covid second time would genetic sequencing.

You wrong. 

Absolutely wrong. assumption correct, all. really good lot places.

careful, reddit.com foreign press making it, noted.

Foreign (non-Swedish) press party blamed here. Many people criticized articles claims, mass downvoted Swedes campaigning here. Two words: lockdowns. Relative countries that's basically nothing. Sweden one countries sane government. Believing Swedes much enlightened everyone else uniform adherence recommendations everyone else flaunts rules naive silly though, mention incorrect given visual proof. Again, evidence galore available Swedes ignoring recommendations (and sky fall might add). 

It's simple: sweden right everyone else wrong. Yes, surgical types plenty research. masks, cloth otherwise, public using primarily? bit grey area. 

The verdict definitely masks back Spring, also actual application applying removing masks may actually increase ones risk infecting themselves.

Anyways, scientists, something unproven, doesn’t mean proven ineffective. People need stop beholding scientists statements almost always accompanied qualifier statements. Science always evolving. didn’t lie, provide best facts time public understand facts evolve knowledge research acquired. need conform new guidelines come out, stick heads sand didn’t know facts since day 1 therefore ignored day 200.

We cannot hold scientists standards politicians, nature scientific process, we.

That's say. reason Im avoiding Id get CVS. sick people walk constantly without mask. always busy. I've got worlds shittiest immune system. (the last bit overdramatized tad) actually based anything.

There's evidence large gatherings high risk. e.g. funerals resulted multiple people infected covid19. evidence specific sizes smaller gatherings safe. angry without punching air wishing people died. brother also call liberals snowflakes?  oddly enough, stimulus check actually increase GDP - rather transfer money. means one two things: higher taxes lower government spending - inflation. None options good.

Never took econ? Youre leaving increase C I, plus multiplier effects. perpetually live long-run. funny couple weeks ago ton stories many students getting virus now.....not really anymore. follow stories saying hospitals next huge universities overflowing, even stories many students getting last couple weeks.

Herd immunity works. Diminishing returns compliance...which mean, also seeing prevaccine.

Even states keep mask mandates social distancing rules place post vaccine...it’s like going people adhering them, gradually less less. keep disease spreading...although hopefully less quickly before...and stretching mandates restrictions. Thanks weird studied general. Current situation, current level spread. talking past ~6 months total. 

Also, Nordic countries fairly light lockdowns, actually far away Sweden did. Lately, Swedish people actually practiced social distancing people Nordic countries. ""anti-masker""? No.

Someone sees lot conflict masks news social media sure trust? Maybe.

That's worth something. I'd say 1/10 large grocery store stockholm sure singers sound good masks lmao

Please make excuses. Hospitalizations should, theory, reliable metric..

Going hospitalizations alone makes hard get idea scope problem. people infected (and spreading virus) end hospital. think need numbers sources get idea area doing. count cases alone can't it, that's true every metric have. Yup, real actual reason. protect healthcare worker , protect human breathes air
 
Is sub really still narrative? 
 
The reason help healthcare workers disposable. get maximum effect, supposed dispose one use. enough masks world healthcare workers that, everyone else. Therefore, reduced using single N95 mask months time, yes - concern vector cross contamination. 
 
That initial thinking, least - I'd argue least plausibly valid early on. understand surface contamination probably concern thought was, suggestions changed reflect that. reality, official stance changed early enough could avoided huge number deaths Trump politicized issue. Wish everyone states saw way live past 10 india blood used cure diseases We’re many months this? Peer pressure isn’t changing someone opinion point Canada proving Really USA 30% less assholes. needs pushed.

Work home, make sure finish drinking pub 10pm. Yeah, no.

First wave hits you. \*Goes away\*. Second wave hits you.

Not ""Wave hits you, drowning, bigger wave covering even further"". 

The phrase ""we're seeing second wave"" implies ever got things back control first. United States failed horribly at. doesn’t make better person them. Also, Boris US. they? whole thing run lobbyists. ""Given infectiousness.""

In vaccinated population, virus still active risk overwhelming hospitals enough people immune get infected, suffer trivial symptoms. seriously depress infectiousness.

Population immunity roll dice. naive population, virus transmits three people person infects. 1/6th population immune, virus (metaphorically speaking) roll dice score 2 more, even protective measures place. Like half-assed solutions, protocols work don't.

This going turn another Sweden, people mislead hailing shining example ""doing things right without shutting down"" takes quick look per-capita deaths see 10x - 20x likely die COVID-19 Sweden Scandinavian/Nordic countries.

Now staff forced wear companies make policy (although company fiance supervisor already made policy wear unless exempt) still people refusing wear can't arsed too. feel fucking hopeless. feel like never going return normal. there’s vaccine it’ll afraid it’s effective enough. there’s community transmission we’ll stay locked there’s active cases fucking Zimbabwe somewhere. goalposts never stop moving. I’m 22 healthy shouldn’t destroy livelihood wake everyday asking it’s worth living. “consensus” “masks” “effective” “worn” whenever interacting “others”. 

Where pushback pink ribbons breast cancer awareness? Similar concept. waves. putting pressure virus. reduce/eliminate way virus spreads.  Except won’t back normal. pretend like be, laws. Unfortunately I'm suggesting that. many articles misquote people like Tedros WHO. people read something article sound right need go primary source. case even necessary. video clip article. 

But general, media terrible science reporting. pandemic made even worse. WHO, briefings hour long affairs long, sometimes nuanced complex statements answers. someone going comment something, spread something read, need actually know hell they're talking about. Right?? literally came comments grumble that! Sorry, saw canadian. dont know shit,thats truth. know human right means. Differences aside, good luck well, wish best you. 300 people party bar/disco without masks distancing, yesterday think direct question looking make changes. (changing rules most(?)

We’ve known reinfection time. many confirmed reinfections now? 20 so? better question would spam reinfection stories around constantly? What’s agenda? isn’t virtue signaling- they’re trying show they’re good people wearing masks. 

They’re setting example wearing mask normal/cool/manly. Thanks canadian guy, telling live. think using word “seasonal” confuses average layman imply virus doesn’t anything summer spreads around winter big deal agree let's say I've vaccinated, point wearing mask? maybe help out...

You, speaking authority, told do, right? claim?  fact, maybe prove true?  

In opinion, contradicted became defensive. Then, proceeded attempt belittle hype up. 

Your opinions beliefs facts. suggest stop expressing though are. Yinz gonna want put ""H"" that. Option 1: voting Trump. Wait...there's vaccine? I'm totally voting Trump.

I see could deciding issue anyone. someone offer scenario would sway enough population mean something? Actually asking make logical sense me.  giant psychology experiment explains many people seem like don’t care deaths elderly. 30 posts past three days regarding pandemic, topic across multiple subs.

Need attention? might made Peace Corps community service prerequisite college required graduate high school. yet, count exceed deaths may counted heart attack thrombosis without tested course uptick also little outdated Two unintended consequences: Putting people limited resources neighborhoods higher cost living (groceries, etc) and, depending local work opportunities, farther work.

Not sure winning situation would look like. right cash lifes

now they'll see bad idea. next weeks cost much earned holiday time Could contributed (even small amount), insane number deaths pandemic hit Europe March, tail-end flu season? terms 5 year old understand: cooperation. flu literally killed 28-year-old cousin 2013. Yes can. think people live normal lives right way used without consequences delusional. big box surgical masks China, I'm starting sweat it. science says covid last pandemic? one said anything smell We’re thing! I’m thinking easy “treasure hunt” riddles follow around house finds basket treats. Love pumpkin hunt idea! way sniff Russians. Visualization narrative imo. Maybe graphs showing talking time would help think/believe currently downward slope. Basically socialise long we're spending money so. got mine flu shot last day August, think early? I’m 30s, healthy covid March &amp; caused immune system weak. Even though covid antibodies, getting bacterial infections, one bad ... 3!! summer. strong antibiotics like month, good. get another flu shot February something? articles posted saying southern hemisphere proper flu season year. might true northern hemisphere.

Flu low R, even quite limited levels social distancing mask-wearing might significant effect. STILL can't believe we're even fighting this. even think write? Cuomo didn’t kill nursing home population, stop spreading lies. Yes, sort thing good idea. Also former tourism industry workers plant trees combat global warming made tourists. Okay, Brock Lesnar went 0.3% basically within standard deviation. Thats 300 extra infected per 100k.

Stop exaggerating. virus earlier spain. number rise US soon September, snowfall yet, intersections get pretty slick around time, sure. full yelled someone coughing Walmart.. weren’t wearing mark covering mouth. Life goes without vibrant tourism industry. capitalism. point mourning obsolete industry. Tourism return anything considered normal way tourists get around include generating heat-trapping carbon pollution. Definitely considering moving Canada. I'd wager Indian cities reach natural herd immunity mass vaccination. Ditto lot poor middle-income countries. Good, requiring proof prevents severe COVID (at least 5 severe placebo). literally live Canada less cases things OVER. still significant restrictions cannot do. rising cases we've actually restrictions enacted recently. I'm saying lot liberal Americans idea pandemic would response similar Canada Europe's responses. Less bad sure, over. needed today thought

Thank everything done. can't imagine amount stress I'm truly grateful utmost respect people line work Canada leader telling people opposite making ""political thing"" rather health thing. mind people resentful can't see truth front them, guy died? welcome go next we'll ask rest again, ""Will please smarten up?"". relief hear I'm one thought this. think human psychology economy country handle requirements years. Many us try also cause sort harm mental health. never thought would fairy tale ending like eradicating virus like saying. control like flu, me, seems like larger possibility.

We wedding (now renewal vows) scheduled November moved next year November. I'm honest family. Right Chicago area max gatherings 50, 50 can't invite family (Irish Catholic. lot us ugh.). I'd either move wedding 50 people. I'd cancel likely get deposit back venue taken huge hit, really blame them.

I guess prepare anything point. Yeah, people sub want wear one permanently. remember half Reddit appears suffer huge amount anxiety, mixed talking ass. observing normal people, think see seems fairly safe again, news stops blasting fear every day masks go away own. people coming stores stop wearing masks employees half ass it, stores change policy with. dangerous virus healthy kids.

""uncle"" FB completed welding correspondence course prison told 6% covid deaths died covid alone. believe morons FB statistical technique routinely utilized epidemiologists demographers determine death tolls disease natural disasters? Hmmmmm? science indicates it. I've seen time. Bootleggers nothing stopping naming shop reputable company Amazon. get sorry confusion, trying keep track everything make blanket statements. There's much sometimes hard find verify. 

I think sociopolitical problem factual, medical, scientific problem. think context often helps that. wonder torn ACL’s COVID cases season. leaning way. Surrender prepare fight fight fight NZ responded well half billionaires flew late February. Seriously, google it. There's vice article geom 2018 documenting rich people bunkers built there.

Bezos, Gates, etc. appealed NZ government shut hard early. That's main reason they're well. Agreed. point, think feel want. also lost someone disease. point making incite change crowd disagrees name-calling celebrating death. nothing help cause - opinion. peak ""hoax"" observed ambulances using nearby main road I've ever previously seen. believe ambulance service part spreading hoax.

I also find difficult believe politicians major parties would want spread lies. Russia &amp; west spread identical lies beyond belief, different lies problem believing.  saying things demonstrably true attempt make pandemic seem much worse is. fear mongering book.

Reality bleak go way change facts make everything worse. way. Are...are kidding me?

Did read comment all, incapable understanding basic concepts? 

Those two possibilities see (except liar posting bad faith).

There way ACTUALLY think 30 million people viral infection genetically sequenced, twice\. even then, count strain. 

WTF wrong you? integrity all? ~43% population approves Trump's performance, yes. f*** would downvote this; upvoted! move it, football head there's much money involved find ways manage risks.

Couldn't also argued ""When there's much money involved, find ways keep infections hidden""? I’ve followed since January 16th yes international flights absolutely could stopped flights. yes, flights states cases seen could absolutely halted exception emergency. 

We lockdown. Period. Lmao psychotic Yup testing centres near capacity day around 5-6am open 8am. people truely need test arnt getting it. people dont want hear country better country lol look dumpster fire. still issue restrooms, still indoors even they're portables. spread virus.

People LA call SFV valley time. based location.  mean literally find hundreds sources, said already

The important thing understand actually expected. long lag — long six weeks, experts told — person gets infected death would reported official tally.

“Why aren’t today’s deaths trending way today’s cases trending? That’s completely way think it,” Eleanor Murray, epidemiologist Boston University, told me. “Today’s cases represent infections probably happened week two ago. Today’s deaths represent cases diagnosed possibly month ago, infections six weeks ago more.”

“Some people get infected die quickly, majority people die, takes while,” Murray continued. “It’s matter one-week lag cases deaths. expect something order four-, five-, six-week months ago. actually found longer treatments get better. 

Again, many sources. many. take cherry picking. known science. S.O.P. Meanwhile stupid ass commercial TV 

 Least risky? exchanging physical objects, creating hundreds potential new transmission vectors?

Sorry, risk level minimal here, even object thrown person. talking strangers handling objects passing out. pretty high guess though people can't trusted responsible!?

Right, this. wear mask little asshole Exactly!!! IQ involved I’m afraid. like statement order “win” “the team”.

That's job creation is, instead Trump gave money already wealthy organisations absolutely incentive pass onto workers. gives following definition clinical evidence SARS infection.  alternative diagnosis fully explain illness. December 31st, 27 cases unknown pneumonia, city 12 million, one died yet... winter..... doubt doctor would've given second thought said.. got pneumonia, prescribed necessary medicine.. doubt would've gone effort really test new virus.

None criteria lists test. whole point alert system patients acute respiratory distress syndrome explainable illness, alert raised. Saying ""infectious pneumonia"" instead viral ARDS literally giving different name thing, considering already giving patients antibiotics none improved. cases met criteria exactly 30 health care workers developed lung infections Jan 10th, excuse sending alert confirming China wait 12th send genome sequence WHO? mention read article talked one week delay. sounded like someone higher position wanted get credit ""finding"" genome, ordered lower lab hold ""confirmation""

Wuhan Institute Virology already sequenced virus' genome January 2nd, Shanghai confirmed January 5th. highest lab WIV, also ordered bite tongues. Good thing did, lower lab shut publishing genome sequence. reported one criteria promotion CPC evidence worth. scientific departments, includes published papers reputable journals. 

This publication journal, uploading genome sequence online database telling citizens wash hands, wear mask, etc. Read article cited scmp again. regarding lab closing down, mentioned earlier, level 4 lab handle new infectious virus. lab level 3. directive labs qualified handle virus either destroy transport another lab. SCMP article posted, lab get permission study it, end January.


Look timeline again. I'll even save 1 January 2020, genetic sequencing company notified Wuhan Municipal Health Committee sequencing novel coronavirus samples longer allowed, existing samples must destroyed data must kept source gene sequencing company, January 1, 2020, received call official Hubei Provincial Health Commission, informing samples new coronary pneumonia cases Wuhan sent inspection, cannot tested again; samples existing cases must destroyed, sample information cannot disclosed, relevant papers related data cannot released outside world, ""If detect future, must report us.""

Further guidance issued January 3rd labs qualified transfer samples designated labs.

But lab Shanghai reported research January 3rd January 12th (their closure). **If closed disobeying directive, closed reported results research (January 5th) instead shut 12 hours publishing results online (January January 2, hospital told staff take pictures leave evidence discussing disease. So, basically, heard Dr. Li got called questioning posted virus, told doctors post virus.

Do see problem definition limited h2h transmission sustained h2h transmission. lot press releases read translated specifically says evidence sustained. think families count sustained transmission.

Sustained H2H transmission community transmission. Evidence sustained transmission Seafood market area there, silenced numerous levels (Hospital supervisory board, Wuhan police force, Hubei Provincial Health Commission). 


By December 30th clear sars-like coronavirus, January 5th undeniable, January 7th CCP admitted fact publicly, yet still acknowledged possibility H2H transmission cannot overlooked. 

Rediculous. makes feel better, dumped coffee neck shirt trying drink mask on. Good job Canada

You liberal look objectively data see US done absolutely abysmal job protecting population regardless adjust population factors.

I derive joy fact. reflects community I'm part of. trying accept it, reflect it, learn society community good. see expecting community we're part better bad thing. also fucking hate wearing it, uncomfortable, it’s better getting someone else sick “uncomfortable”. human life worth discomfort know many Canadians think US shithole. I'm sure idea exists among Canadians subtle superiority Canadians feel compared Americans, like Canadians things ""proper way"". I'm sure stems from, think Canadian exclusive thing either. actually love visiting country keep coming back. tell Canadians think Canada utopia delusional. 

One thing sure country's issues easily overpower Canadian issues even country. Constant volatility, talking heads, easily manipulated viewers, stereotypes get dragged along causing us sick idea AMERICA. can't ignore it, America everywhere. Nobody even pays attention horrible crap happens does. 

Anyways, understand Canadian perspective, ""USA shithole"" widely shared feeling far tell. understand coming sometimes, America, confuses us makes us angry. difference is: get choose commute, get choose take risks like road tripping vacation going amusement park.

I hate people sub say stuff like ""we wear masks another 6 months vaccine"" I'm like...no. need interact people. social. Live life, survive. went COVID test today (needed upcoming procedure) kept pulling incrementally slightly could get swab in. humorous - heard one tech jokingly say ""this may first time we've repeatedly tell someone lower mask more"".

(They annoyed, amused)

Of course I'm pulling away hear behind - ""No ma'am, need keep mask on. Yes, kids. we'll tell take off. Ma'am, 60F here, hot we've masks since 6am"". you’re wearing mask public, I’m making assumptions politics, intelligence well. quite doubt. consistent, clear messaging govt helped keep quieter South. Thankfully. Although looks like taking seriously. Boris last months telling people go back work threat bring sacked didn't, launched scheme encourage people eat help economy telling people work home blaming spike went out.. I'm Canadian. I'll wear mask I'm fucking handcuffed forced face.

You people pathetic. line? even one would rather comply there's nothing left? know mean! live Lake Balboa/Encino work near Thousand Oaks. Walking around neighborhood people wearing masks even outdoors, get closer work fewer people wearing them. neighborhood pretty wealthy Topanga pretty crunchy...I wonder anti-masker/anti-vaxxer types there? Anyway, safe neighbor! asking Trump's quotes Feb/March, Fauci. Canadians English American. went doctor even dentist. Everyone make choices, thought reasonably safe. definitely want flu shot year. 

I’m traveling car visit parents that’s it. try self quarantine best 14 days go. 

For holidays think it’ll parents. Small holidays suit better tbh although miss people. Still, better safe sorry Several months ago banned two weeks one Corona Reddits unscientific bringing studies. CDC acknowledged time. perfect sense. However, truth eventually figured out. CDC worthless. make mistakes interfered with. controlled large degree, truths come out. People ""sorry, told so"" suddenly write book wan publicize go news keep saying sorry are... that's removed office need sell book. nothing wrong anti-conservative No, people outside today. air worse.

We set record spare air days. record, twice all-time record. 

Are unfamiliar purple air, that's referenced, butnyou responded ""purple days"", thing. ""More Americans lying wearing masks"" wife gone full Karen people exposed noses stores. traitors Canada.   Pandemics part nature people die pandemics. is. good thing, natural thing. life. honestly pandemic average age death literally 80 years old comorbidities exactly pandemic I'm shaking fear over. would vaccine though. Ayyy, chill hate bud. made life difficult? get run almost daily scooters, still... well said No, source provided HARVARD (idk you, Harvard seems pretty damn trustworthy comes science) saying 2-8 weeks. provided one instance France supports claim comparatively small level. indicative worldwide trend? Following that, provided reputable source showing definitively going take 6-8 weeks die COVID. anything, shown significantly evidence claim. 

Your last statement wrong much misinformation spread - people, like (whom assume little background science), make claims bend backwards try prove correct. despite almost every scientific source stating otherwise. instead listening sources, people try come seemingly logical objection (old sources, better treatments, etc.) explains experts wrong. this, boil belittling person asking evidence. 

Good luck you. Reluctant compliance better compliance.

I expect everyone like wearing masks. cant wear one. doctors exemption since would essentially break nose since reconstructed. reached community help custom mask got silence. work involves going lots businesses city. know anymore. stay isolated people, distanced I'm out, clean hands. Otherwise, sorry damn Met Life turf lol Covid much higher fatality rate flu. cdc death estimates 19-20 flu season aren’t far outside experienced kids disappointed 

Until see fucking pounds candy they’re getting backyard scavenger hunt we, not, set record bad air days SF recorded history?

Good god, one slithery person. Well America that’s reason people wear them, tbh, it’s bad thought would based first wave. don’t seem need outside, shouldn’t really inside people’s homes, masks mostly admission.

Our “second” wave, call that, really quite dud considered. Hopefully I’m eating words two months, think it’s gonna dry speak, SARS MERS. Would rather dishonest?? I'm NY agree NY been, luckily, done first wave here. get slammed again, officially second wave.

For New York, specifically.

For United States country, we're still first wave. We've went tiny bit mostly keep climbing. Hate break virus ever goes away stay pandemics either. Stomp virus elevated risk gradually time help vaccines and/or virus naturally mutates becomes less deadly like pretty much previous pandemic history. day future present time now, it'll likely flu type thing flares time time.

Why needless death long term health issues caused covid little bit uncomfortable months say everything could protect other?

E: point aim keeping control restrictions daily life possible we've built herd immunity, either vaccination infection.

That exactly they're doing. They're putting place restrictions. lockdown like spring. online poll conducted Sept. 18 20 surveyed 1,538 adult Canadians. cannot assigned margin error internet-based polls considered random samples.

This poll article mean nothing  five months, America led world far sheer numbers confirmed infections deaths. U.S. less 5% globe’s population 20% reported deaths. yet, americans appear, also poll data, likely wear masks Ok makes sense. getcha. every locale earth proven ""be done it"" deaths cases come down, exponentially increase right back (or case US, much worse). June attempt ""just done it"", clearly work. We're still paying human price that. Thanksgiving without inviting people keeping kids college probably ok. Itnis factor. Ae nowhere near even thing reinection (and is). Yeah. certainly doesn’t help. 
What WOULD helped would LEADER could led start, didn’t that. 

I consider pretty intelligent, college educated don’t understand lot real medical lingo involved this. I’m sure people less educated find thing understand run it. P live society must follow rules must follow consequences. Also living world must breathe, eat, shit die. Also MUSt wear cloth public MUST deal consequences. choice - obviously deal fine daily that.
Don‘t give BS like „but want wear clothes want support country witz money pay taxes - want would go prison“.
So wear god damn mask stop talking pseudo freedom.
Freedom able go mask stay home due lockdown.

Sorry, relate yout train thought. see contradictions longer think through. Literally happened D: eager publish anything supporting narrative people think wearing mask ""restricting freedom"" they're gonna love Trudeau enact EA (Emergencies Act). sure that. checked multiple times daiIly purple air, etc. bad long time. ""unhealthy"" necessarily level people stay home more. constant newscasts, text alerts, etc spairbthe air days due bad air quality, pretty much doubled previous record.

I also would see far fewer people outside month. People stay home it. thing. said nobody suggesting social distance years vaccine distributed. talking period distribution contingency planning event vaccine effective. see lot straw manning thread.

This thing feel like quick roll back. Wearing mask seriously big deal. agree need open everything back up, keep mask use 6-12 months? What's harm? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article better infiltrated alt-right buffoons, onguardforthee heavily liberal ""anti-conservative"" ""anti-r/Canada"" actual alternative that's things Canadian.

I'm liberal also appreciate splitting people apart turning everything us-VS-them battle.

Just heads-up. current total cases new cases US trending down.

The numbers last weeks virtually seeing past month. They've objectively terrible numbers see what's promising plateauing daily cases 2.5mil active cases.

For record, think Canada's growth promising either cannot keep control. Let's see: Democrats passed coronavirus aid package May Republican majority senate completely blocked it. One side clearly trying get stimulus bill passed puts money hands people need (Democrats) side obstructing (Republicans). Therefore SiDeS bAd!!! Saskatchewan! Jeez fragile guys ego? what? 2A irrelevant. I’m referring militia checkpoints Oregon recent fires. actions illegal. Propaganda consider normal? surprised if, point, essentially everything reopened mask use still widespread. ""normal?""

Herd immunity depends highly behavior - need immunity way people acted before, keep wraps fewer people need immune keep numbers down. Depending effective vaccine is, continued caution could make huge difference. I'm making fun people stupid think put blind trust government Pedro Gallardo, head Healthy Municipality area ​​the town Caimancito, spoke Unju Radio health situation Ramalean city due new cases COVID-19.

Due increase cases registered Caimancito, talk possible encapsulation city, however Gallardo explained that, “the measure taken gendarmerie security forces Regional 42, responsible Commissioner Valentín Escalera, spoken ask greater protection community, population complies prevention measures publicly known.

""We observing community lost perception risk pandemic implies, presenting increase cases population relevant cases reinfection.""

It health personnel 40 days medical discharge contracted virus again, reason Gallardo asked population take account importance virus comply requested measures.

Caimancito currently total 107 cases COVID-19, 71 recovered, 28 active cases 4 hospitalized, total 7 deaths.

Regarding epidemiological monitoring suspected cases coronavirus, explained total 160 people comply isolation close contacts positive cases, health agents nurses hired government charge going homes take temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure heart rate. understand people die virus diseases. 
.I urge look deaths. Go cdc site. 

You see less 10k died covid alone. cdc site. 

The rest died combination illness etc... 

You realize died cancer tested positive covid shown covid related death. 

Your data pool tainted. 

You can't make everyone live. Disney show folks. People die. virus. kill you. president could kept everyone alive. 

Grow getting tested also find cases well ? mean ton angry boomers complaining pretending overblown ignoring entirely. Shit bunch baboons protesting covid 5G/Bill gates outside work weeks ago. Alberta fucked, Canada's mini-america. Thanksgiving would like word Virus going virus.

* know
* understand.

????

It's pretty simple:

* wear mark
* stay 6 feet away
* wash hands frequently, especially coming back home outside
* disinfect commonly touched surfaces home
* get vaccinated flu
* [why not?] wear face shield (and mask too) forced crowded spaces like subway, trains, planes.

If 99% people that, we'd crappy situation now. Here's luck! (Apparently good fidgety kids, also.)

Eta:. see Etsy sale, referred origami masks well.  dirty make triple-layered Don’t forget “How good news?” comments! Looking rt.live, seems keep Rt 1.0 without full lockdown least April. state, PA, &amp; even NY, Rt refuses stay 1.0 long. hovers right around 1.0 ever since reopening even rest restrictions still place. Hey hope right wish best. fact long virus there, limit lockdowns measures kill economy ruin personal freedoms enjoyment life. 

We still know much virus. heard study saying virus stays kids noses month even catch it, may spread it. literally cannot tell satire not. Ok called 3 places- I’m im showing symptoms results take 3-7 business days (all places require Referal appts). I’m showing symptoms found one place rapid test. options lie medical professional get rapid test, or, apparently results improved since last time 3-7 days results. 

Just small update all. promise I’m trying best here. I'd send letter back saying ""fuck you"" [Currently, almost LOL!!!!!! calling 200k deaths trumps continuously lying grasping straws. 

My
God. picture truly worth thousand words stupid. FPRs EQA ranged 0 16.7% full data set, 0 8.1%
for subset. median interquartile range lower full data set
(median=2.3%, interquartile range=0.8-4.0%) subset (median=2.5%, interquartile
range=1.2-4.0%) Alexander Hamilton dubbed United States ""grand experiment"". obvious experiment failure. federal government caught red handed stealing PPE states. federal government utterly failing control pandemic claimed 200,000 lives. president actively fomented chaos entire course pandemic.


It's time forward thinking people make decision: break away rogue states trying drag us back dark ages. absurd notion, US breaks up, eternal entity last forever? Honestly simpler that, private property, rules. tell fuck property reason wanting gone. There's bill constitution allows right nullify landowners rights.

Seriously, people could fathom idea rights treads other's. eat people first stranded island cause bet ass they'll raid coconuts sleep. Damn straight. socialized medical system Canadians receive Robust Competent treatment. Every mask worn additional tax payer money need spent. I'm aware that. point is, people reacting stuff without knowledge variables various circumstances countries last time faced society faced a, 'disaster like this?' like commented before, individual risk acceptance. accept end impacting others around people might never taken risk (see dead Maine wedding attend). Also, mean by, 'simply deadly enough care?' 200,000 dead otherwise would likely still among loved ones enough think matters? 36k 21st according worldometers pulls official sources. 51k 18th.

But cant look single day worth data make data say anything single data point need look trend. Especially someone like virus exponential growth. current total cases new cases US trending down. active cases starting plateau. Theres still 2.5 mil active cases US thats nuts leveling promising sign.  many times guys keep clicking links say ""ThE wOrSt yEt 2 ComE BeGinInG""


Come six months now. long take till catch Editorialized title include three countries name clickbait nature headline irritating, hope that's okay. say half developed world seeing second waves. give hubris viruses controllable every nation besides America well? can’t, aren’t, order We've also nearly eradicated polio eliminated measles, infectious disease known, Americas.

There absolutely reason disease cannot eradicated sign scientific historically illiteracy claim otherwise. educated yes also listen science experts. Apart Victoria, Australia achieved almost thing despite continent, European countries countries Asia.

Isolation important think. Maybe compelling you. medical consensus political consensus, important distinction. zero medical “consensus” masks, majority however think might well try every measure limit spread unsuccessful, masks don’t hurt nearly much social distancing requirements. It’s also easy politicians, don’t enforce substantive restrictions point mask policy enforcement evidence taking seriously. 

May remind I’m merely stating opposition don’t personally care much masks, bothers people think science around effectiveness clear something like climate change. many falsely convinced masks ultimate protective shield. personally don’t think theyre use warranted outdoors crowd, transmission rare circumstances. defend wearing circumstances also defend idea people wearing masks flu season pandemic over.

Why think haven’t recommended masks Netherlands many countries? experts wrong unlike chosen experts? 

The top health experts Netherlands countries don’t think masks usage general public beneficial. probably moderately effective optimal conditions right materials, even yet completely proven. lot comes COVID primarily spreads, still uncertain. idea masks alone drive pandemic ground, however, complete nonsense America could learn lesson patriotism Canada. thing agree comment “time tell”. 

April 8th 15th weren’t **extreme** outliers. high daily deaths, like April 22nd May 27 quite low. count. 

It’s really easy make trend line early/mid April today. I’m beginning wonder looking data graphs. Could provide source Sweden old people?

The median age percent population 65 found Wikipedia really support this. i'm sorry y'all dealing severe anxiety pandemic fatigue people are, would REALLY good idea stop reading articles saying ""normal two years away"", ""the vaccine work right away"", whatever hell headline day is. 

these articles meant manage expectations completely ignore psychology frustration relative deprivation... simply regurgitate information challenges vaccine roll-out, effectiveness 100% guarantee, etc. simply find new scary headline repackage get clicks. 

for time being, live system media profit incentive incentive leads publish doom-and-gloom reporting, interspersed kernels hopeful stuff. type intermittent reinforcement powerful tool that, example, keeps gamblers constantly coming back casinos, keeps Americans constantly refreshing scrolling news. i'm succumbing myself. 

the fact is, simply know much challenge roll-out obstacles pose gaps vaccine's effectiveness are, we're stage yet. moderna pfizer currently producing full capacity. vaccines need kept cold need stored temperature dry ice, something done daily basis across country transport food medical supplies. 

we also know virus behave winter- whether apocalyptic spikes truly coming. cold weather likely reduce large gatherings superspreader events- instead, people see families smaller gatherings spread virus smaller scale. estimating seasonal transmissibility factors based winter Southern Hemisphere also difficult, countries experience milder winter would lead fewer behavioral changes (and also probably milder increase infectiousness... knows). 

cases 11% last week US. tests reported 25% positivity rate dropped around 0.5%. likelihood, true number infections actually dropping slightly right now, despite media reporting tell you. 

and vaccine work, COVID continues circulate high levels long time... we'll adapt too, find better, safer ways return schools, workplaces, fun social events. lockdowns persistent restrictions place entire world built environment non-COVID times unprepared send people back lives environment. becomes clear we're longer haul, changes made environments make things manageable. changes might also better terms environmental impact simply returning back normal.

things unbelievably scary right probably foreseeable future given radical actions needed combat climate change. locked forever unable see friends without mask forever. people trying connect literally last dying days human civilization we'll get soon. 

keep supporting neighbors working together change, try stop reading fucking news. better days ahead got this. 

100 days left 2020... knew cruise ships. Look happened recent Red Deer protest acting smug. We’re egalitarian society. Antimaskers fringe treated such. Majorities Republicans Democrats wearing masks. inflating numbers antimaskers giving influence actually have. sub pretty quiet sports ensuring everyone would doomed shut within 2 weeks starting Taken 7 weeks australia stub eye?

Like, eating spaghetti fork slips. I'm sure others thankful. Pretty sure majority Americans say that, too. assholes get press.

[Yeah, example:

Measles R0 12 **basic reproduction number**, **basic reproductive number** (sometimes called **basic reproduction ratio** **basic reproductive rate**), denoted {\\displaystyle R\_{0}}📷 (pronounced *R nought* *R thought [expected cases directly generated one case population individuals infection.

&amp;#x200B;

For every person it, spread 12-18 people.. 

unless something done (vast majority kids get MMR vax)

&amp;#x200B;

rt we're ""handling"" situation.

in 50% states, still up-to-date values Rt, key measure fast virus growing. It’s average number people become infected infectious person. Rt 1.0, virus spread quickly. Rt 1.0, virus stop spreading. [Learn I'm sure understand meant. can’t first pandemic world history cause us adopt permanent disruptive NPIs. I’m yet enough pessimist believe that.

I think less adopting permanent disruptive NPIs virus serving catalyst changes technology made possible.

While think social norms change little far NPIs go (people wearing masks sick public transportation flu season seen odd anymore likely become fairly commonplace), significant change availability acceptance telecommuting working home.

Sorry, places like Chicago going really bad time. Even virus riots lead reversing pre-COVID urbanization trend among young, there's going massive loss people coming city work feel need close offices downtown. Places like Chicago New York going see massive dislocations severe budget stress. experience here. Everyone anecdotes, mine seeing lot responsible people. 

We rely data. Lol Literally never seen anyone argue agai st masks go ahead France carry test/population India, way more. cant compare them. god Sweden's 75% way average deaths per year we're only...75% way year...

What disaster...? really expect flu season bad. way reduced southern hemisphere social distancing mask wearing. expect US. worded better myself.


In rude way, thought American might find interesting, English person says college mean college like Americans (here call uni) we're referring 16-18 education normally done either BTEC levels. They're maybe ½ ⅔ way towards university degree terms complexity, intensity, academic rigour. They're vital get unis full time employment here. changes anything said, thought might like know. That's Depending inoculation count, took anywhere 500 years, 200 years eradicate it.

If count decided elimination would goal, took 11 years. Ithaca lovely - recommend visiting representative democracy. don’t see can’t return offices universities masks still avoid large gatherings early 2021? Like things don’t fully go back normal that’s reasonable forced isolation vaccine seems unnecessary Cornell (for grad school) Bypass surgeries country postponed need space COVID patients.

Still soccer matches pubs open.

Fuck hate Netherlands stricter rules. Population density good statistic people evenly distributed around country. NZ large areas almost completely depopulated half population lives within couple hours drive other. conservative Trump-loving way, shape form, but...this. CNN pox. coverage virus also sensationalistic, misleading, downright irresponsible times.

Bro government stands science. say ""Jump science data"" better reply high. know what's best you. capable determining that. government tell live. forget that. Donald J. Trump president.

He allowed 200,000 citizens die, concerned golfing.

He still approval rating nearly _half_ US population.

Your citizens argue support for-profit healthcare system expensive less effective public option.

And comparatively, yes US less educated Canada: Exactly! pretty difficult understand Spain numbers, thats told graph, gives real view covid deaths numbers going down. wait... 2 things kill alone, deadly working together!? scoop! Yeah, recall arguing people 100% certain sports would shutdown within month starting up. there's much money involved find ways manage risks. many times going read headline phrased different ways ""fairytale"" part expecting on/off switch vaccine actually approved. going several months rollout, that's providing get compliance. 

But yeah, hit point agree saying. think co infections pretty common. Cold knocks immune system allows something opportunistic come in. Bonus points caused go pharmacist, hospital, doctor, w/e get exposed illness recommended even indoor private gathering, mask 6 feet distance preferably outdoors
 There's articles saying issue another means way spread people get comfortable around family friends
 cautious public let guard home. weirdly enough enjoy wearing mask , makes feel less shy public spaces much relaxed safe, medical sense. 
Although ask people repeat said much suck negate effects. Im sure attached link googles covid data greenland.

However pulling data data clearly easily displayed countries well links sources pulling data. tends country provincial data trust official numbers published. 

First look US active cases.
 
* Date   Active cases % change previous day 
* 14 Sept  2,531,535
* 15 Sept  2,526,528  99.802%
* 16 Sept  2,514,706  99.532%
* 17 Sept  2,524,297  100.381%
* 18 Sept  2,537,886  100.538%
* 19 Sept  2,547,634  100.384%
* 20 Sept  2,554,237  100.259%
* 21 Sept  2,542,189  99.528%  7 day average = 100.061

So US active covid cases growing average 0.061% every day. growth rate changes daily trending downward. 

Now lets look Canadas numbers period. 

* Date  Active cases  % change previous day. 
* Sept 14  7607  
* Sept 15  7775   102.208%
* Sept 16  8105   104.244%
* Sept 17  8558   105.589%
* Sept 18  8983   104.966%
* Sept 19  9376   104.375%
* Sept 20  9741   103.893%
* Sept 21  10653  109.363% 7 day average = 104.953%

Canadas active cases growing 4.953% daily number trending up. seen average growth rate high since April 11. continue trend heading things look good us canadians. 

The current US active case numbers still far worse Canadas currently. However looking headed wont remain way long. 

So lets see data is? Nah shingles reinfection happen already chickenpox. Covid example reactivation genomes different. No. notice people using COVID excuse casual sex. get lot offers house hangouts dates. ask go eat hang public, answer always ""I want something COVID safe."" 

Yeah, inviting randoms house magically protects getting covid. /s  Pretty much already doctor Canada basically fucked waiting list family doctor like 2 years. Getting appointment see one bad walk clinics full day event healthcare system basically sucks ""free"" that. pandemic becomes pandemic, stopping it.

Smallpox.

It higher R0 endemic basically everywhere.

We eradicated it. use source yesterday report number deaths John Hopkins

The difference backlog Basque Country numbers (+200 deaths) Ok, think get it. yesterday's report. acknowledged 30663 one today counts 30904 deaths. think get it. 241 people died yesterday, they, YESTERDAY, accepted ""dead covid"" another 241 people. stupid way counting can't really know pandemic going might (will) backlog. anyone information re-testing? part husband's union contract, test NEGATIVE allowed return work. tested positive 9/11 symptoms mild. Obviously need get back work, zero idea test again. 12 days later soon? I'm seeing tests come back positive MONTHS. Good! I've taken 3 cabs distance less 5 miles time.

I wore mask. drivers wear mask. Windows open trip less 10 minutes long.

It much safer 8 hours spend per day work.

Does make cretin? Way see it, wear it... wear less. Americans stubborn wearing them, they'll get sicker, wear masks longer. brainer. takes surprisingly small amounts face hair compromise seal. 5 o’clock shadow sometimes enough reduce (inhalation) effectiveness measurable amount. went buy carton cigarettes day saw people wearing masks. It’s like don’t care health long term damage lungs even survive. always wear mask. Even I’m running cigarettes real quick care health health others. saying statement “early April” false since 8th / 15th?

No, saying false decline begin May 7 earliest. April 8 15 extreme outliers, average throughout entire period 75-80 deaths per day, continued like right first week “pretty clear pattern”?

Cases begin declining last weeks spring begin rising first weeks autumn... that's clear indication/pattern suggests change behaviour warmer months affected spread virus number deaths result spread. may wrong, time tell. truth manipulative!  guess trick set whole mf state fire. Texas, got next guys. 13% Canadians Americans. Umm... say democrat hoax. even goes acknowledge let people virus. 

You guys grasping straws. 

You pushed lunacy far. fail big time November. decisive repugnant. grasp faintest things blow proportion. sad. Torontonian here. many idiots noses hanging out. loathe going grocery store seeing it, makes angry alarmed. Holy shit guys dying argue someone. say population spread evenly? said NZ mostly rural meant sparsely populated. stupid you??? relative pretty ruthless says things like, ""eh let die."" towards people take virus seriously mask up. 😳 Nigeria alright this! ideal, kids difficult masks, typically closer ground. Sometimes modelling appropriate behavior best option available. Culture big part. Asian cultures generally tight-knit, family unit based. Western cultures tend individualistic. mindset affects think relation responsibilities others. WEARING MASK CIVIC DUTY. Gee, thought. ""If continue behave way I'm going really mad""...(times infinity). Nah mask full sheet carbon filter insert behind whole mask plus 2 extra layers fabric. they're rising past week?
