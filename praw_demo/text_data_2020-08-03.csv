Sorry book, I‚Äôm one crazy Disney people. 

Not OP, I‚Äôm sure referring to, fanbase split direction parks former CEO Bob Iger current CEO, former head theme park division, Bob Chapek. 

Putting aside downward slide parks customer service, maintenance, sanitation point view constant penny pinching, suffered creatively two Bobs. classic attractions, like Haunted Mansion, Pirates Caribbean, Jungle Cruise, Space Mountain, original iteration Epcot based Disney intellectual property. Disney parks incredibly well themed worlds complimented Disney. Now, company force IP IP parks, many times expense overall theme area IP going. Many fans love idea IP, others (I‚Äôd argue older fans) think parks losing original vision. 

Epcot original theme park theme exploration education. original rides, even relatively recent ones, weren‚Äôt based IP. old classics like Spaceship Earth, told story humanities journey earth thus far, newer rides like Soarin‚Äô, awesome hang glider journey scenery California. 

You also small little attractions countries World Showcase. One cult classics, Maelstrom, boat ride though mythology Norway. closed turned cheap Frozen attraction. movie Frozen Norway know, hey, sells tickets that‚Äôs that‚Äôs important Disney days. They‚Äôre also building Guardians Galaxy roller coaster Epcot, completely place. They‚Äôve also announced addition attractions themed Moana, Ratatouille, ending best fireworks show Disney theme park could replace one full Disney characters. 

In California rethemed Tower Terror, fit perfectly theme area in, another Guardians Galaxy attraction. giant tower themed Marvel characters doesn‚Äôt really fit old timey streets California theme land sits. changed area themed California pier Pixar Pier threw cheap Pixar theming existing rides. 

The original areas parks themed ideas, like Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland. it‚Äôs IP. Cars Land, Marvel land, Star Wars land, Pixar Pier, Toy Story Land, Avatar land, etc. etc. 

The days old Disney imagination creativity seem gone. parks giant advertisements movie franchises. people think theme parks works art, walking Disneyland literally designed like curtains rising movie, sight lines used agonized able see one area park didn‚Äôt break theming another, it‚Äôs disappointing. detail planning went Disneyland truly something behold books books details don‚Äôt notice, subconsciously paint giant cohesive picture. seems like that‚Äôs thrown away name forcing movie characters many attractions possible. 

Some people love it, people hate it. I‚Äôm sure tell stand. wish best, whatever misfortune suffer doing. Whatever. 9 months. It‚Äôs still won‚Äôt overnight.

That‚Äôs also stop production every vaccine they‚Äôre making Why? Oh tides turned. Let‚Äôs remember unlike MLB players taking risks making big time money , UNPAID athletes. definitely don‚Äôt agree woman acting like asshole can‚Äôt wrap mind around going pier 1 pandemic compromised immune system. I‚Äôm steroids right rheumatologic flare (which comprises immune system) won‚Äôt even go grocery store. We'll wait see effective TV learning be. Many thought distance learning online great idea, even though many students gave weeks districts bothering grades since schools closed.

To think Mexico 100 deaths per million surpassing US. Chile Peru already probably two weeks Brazil catch up. Oh no. cold lmao ‚ÄúNow understand works.‚Äù

He lies EVERYTHING. There's also 50% drop premature births.

During great depression life expectancy went (peaking worst years depression), forms natural accidental deaths dropped

**The students coming classroom. school district distance learning, teachers come school teach empty classroom set distance learning, students home.**

this district standardizing equipment/ensuring teachers need to, ensuring consistent teaching environment teachers work, making school proceed normal. 

This might weird inconvenient teachers, deathtrap situation ALL. **Student staying home. teachers empty classrooms. everyone try READING ARTICLE next time. yeesh.**  oh yeah, one paper shows demonstrations encouraged people demonstrating stay away downtown lol. contains data june 9, 2 weeks floyd's actual death, too. even worth time day really. further, there's comparison protests outdoor gatherings (this obvious; would impossible put enough controls place get meaningful comparison) California allows remove mask eating outside (except crowds, like protests).

These men eating outside. nothing wrong. Yea man, God really fair testing people, amirite? right now, due covid, weight loss, sucks. I‚Äôm skeptical too, they‚Äôre reporting cases you‚Äôd think we‚Äôd see big discrepancy number cases number deaths next weeks? one. called ‚ÄúPlaybook Early Response High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats Biological Incidents.‚Äù 

It left Obama administration ripped trump.  Holy shit got receipts!

Go get you‚Äôre God‚Äôs work right now! Dont trust us, see care cares believe not? Average NFL career lasts 3 years. Median CAREER earnings around \~3 mil. I'm using median removes outliers top making $250+ mil career. 

Are really arguing someone makes \~3 mil automatically multimillionaire? idea defining term, even took unrealistically generous interpretation term saying MM someone single cent 2 million assets minus liabilities, someone makes 3 million years still multi-millionaire. Unless find contradicting numbers averages posted dig source showing NFL players league seasons easily transitioning 6-figure office jobs (spoiler, quite opposite), pretty much dead wrong here. 

Odell **is** clearly multi-millionaire, speaking rest league \~50% players make career amount even close 2 million taxes unavoidable league team expenses phased league, often nothing useless student-athlete degree (if even that) transferable life skills. Friend mine seriously considering going. doesn‚Äôt make much money three kids. trip booked year advance. Cancelled covid.

I going hospital tests. Heart, x-ray lungs, blood, gastroscopy, Sarcoidosis test (I couple years ago) etc etc. cannot find anything. values perfect (not overweight, drink alcohol, eat less healthy etc). 


After ruling everything ended three alternatives: stress, brain tumor, Covid.

 
They find either brain tumor (no symptoms) stress (I fit profile) likely causes. 


And kinda ""know"" stress-related. Life less perfect typically handle stress well. course wrong, feel related. 


We live lock-down, comes kinda natural spend time front computer anyway. big garden kids could play. Everyone enjoyed homeschooling etc. indeed caused stress, kind stress never noticed. 


Anyway, attacks gradually became milder less frequent. hard time sleeping; I'm fall wake rush heart pounding, math head, fall asleep. 


Never experienced anything like before.  looked stats failure appear UK vs US. UK typically cash-for-bail system charge fail appear. US, remained steadily 1/4 people released jail fail appear first court date. UK, 75,000 fail appear 2.99 million Yes, call anti-maskers shame them. 

I NEVER understand hard people wear fucking mask. one simplest things life, literally. Damn, kinda sad get full football team. I'm going 500,000 nationwide.

Same. going sad Christmas. I'm economist commonly accepted field mortality tends drop recessions. surprised initially graduate macro, data pretty clear. reduce spread 80% - could done everyone wearing masks - longer pandemic, dissappears rapidly. need perfect, even need anywhere close perfect. virus speed people currently it, start reducing reductions also exponential. like there's constant, unchanging virus emitter we're able cover 80% it. virus. people expect? kills people, noone safe, best. mean suddenly noone dies anymore. still dangerous virus still around.
We actually try get rid it, means still need distance wear masks. least less likely dead guilt killing others wearing mask. Get yourselves. people get hit drunk drivers still still illegal ‚ÄúEvery type leisurely year tainted pandemic: pleasures cheering sports team, sharing laugh friend bar, catching latest superhero film multiplex, perusing racks fast-fashion store. people either taken part reopenings, coped adapting new experiences, continued wait solution. Disney fans simply same, chasing raw gratification don‚Äôt feel anywhere else.‚Äú

At point, could continue. Please put sharp teeth future renderings mouse That's statistics works. P value much greater .05 (less 95% certainty efficacy) stats well within margin error sample size.

Basically there's good chance (35% based sample size) difference percents random variance attributable HCQ. case failed reject null hypothesis study inconclusive best.

However taken account symptom data found strong statistically relevant increase symptoms users HCQ authors reached negative conclusion advising HCQ. Technically yes, rare, usually done misconduct (fraud, plagiarism, etc..) relation PhD dissertation itself. Didnt knew Ben Sharpiro Reddit account people get: actions time kill somebody. Going without mask akin actual manslaughter. 

That exaggeration, told repeatedly many people died personally prevent that. holy crap, easier.

But still somehow much many. Hell exists, LOT sealed fates... always seemed bit strange fully grown adults become devoted media franchise, usually say whatever makes happy. fact people willing risk health, family's health, health everyone come contact goes beyond simply fan. pure selfishness. respect people visiting parks, bars, non-essential venue guy 12 beers plows car pedestrian.  hours...you could get working office, around people building (like jails/prisons--that's mainly check US).  Greatest health care system world right there. /s

America fucking sucks. assault someone cough me, allowed defend ... fists face? one predict mean dont plan! illustrious leader seen fit use defense production act protect Americans PPE Chinese pork imports. want add appreciate attitude here. wish Americans realized weird is. one flagged article? So, children totally immune covid covid deaths reported 90%? Shit gotta dog bites accounted 180k excess deaths year. Thanks u/Wikipedia really prove disprove dude's point appears highly political, again. beg differ. recalling several politicians within Germany lost degree due dissertation found fraudulent happens happens elsewhere. say Easter. understand reviews opposite (either super soft rough tears...)

Some people ~~are~~ hypersensitive assholes. Poor viewpoint Childless adults. know couple like coasters etc. go based dining alone.

Got called crazy whole family. HAH I'm crazy, maybe am.  I‚Äôm surprised, thought might another baby boom ‚ÄúCovid/Corona babies‚Äù.

The children born mostly conceived three months us heard Covid-19.

Depending country talking about, Covid baby-boom would come late 2020 early 2021.   Could care less! I'm tired tv show wanna glass house idiots thinking people give shit births... Media disgusting petty! Vaccines also help infected overcome disease faster enhances immune system combat illness action top treatments, prevent it. mathematical point view, far fewer infected people healthy ones makes sense lower spreading virus vaccinating ones carry first. also logistic task. much easier produce deliver vaccine infected hot spots lower infection rate vaccinate healthy one prevent getting it.

Also, vaccine made virus (a weaker non-lethal version), part helps body integrate rna develop strong defense future reinfections. lay person access tests? available at-home use? big surprise. I'm going honest, whole 'we vaccine year/year half' felt pretty sketchy me, two reasons. First, sort pharmaceutical product take lot time go various stages testing make sure safe. Second off, understand corona type viruses well versus something like flu. never actually found vaccine SARS-1 money dried one promise caused rats develope cytokine storm reaction presence SARS-1 (basically allergic reaction allergic reaction). think thinning hair looks good. Mine thinning years cut hair make look intentional. pull look long like it. I'm trusting numbers foreseeable future  Doesn‚Äôt seem Tegnell willing either. example still doesn‚Äôt seem think people without symptoms major problem spread virus known parts world back February.

Well, like Day Jackal, Fox kind boring even well reviewed. Keep mind ride capacity also down. rollercoasters basically filling first last rows, that's it. Boat rides like Pirates, talking one two parties per boat, Disney used squeeze 15 people. looked wait times scientifically, would imagine mid-day peaks would ""quiet"" time. dad went Splash Mountain today photo sent showed 30 minute wait background.  take us long figure out.

We knew based early reports China.

In fact, sub pictures posted hospital window earliest US case cautioned employees aerosolized.

Pulled kids preschool told limited people Feb March slowly stock supplies. degree related health everything learned virus crash course Dec. March, I've least step ahead county more.

I understand regular readers sub tuned deep concerns virus spreads body regardless infection severity. yet another ""finding"" we've known entire time spreading US one reason another articulated kind discovery. get bed safest to? Holy cow, story sounds surreal hard believe even hearing audio. I'm really sorry situation, sounds incredibly tough. wish best. watching new Axios interview Trump interviewer going back forth whether correct way report Corona related deaths percentage positive cases result death (according Trump) percentage country's population died result Covid (according interviewer).

Imagine two scenarios:

1. 500,000 people test positive Covid. 12,000 people die Covid.

2. 2,000,000 people test positive Covid. 30,000 people die Covid.

If understand post correctly according Trump's favoured measure, Covid deaths lower second scenario, little bit silly.

Is stupid thinks deaths lower second scenario? Possibly. likely he's trying confuse things supporters say, ""there's lot disagreement. knows whether deaths down?"" Oh would trust going eat thousand dollars whatever is? Hopefully got good park time shit went down. Mother 10 wow Lol u dumb fuck, pretending care, literally hope peace, death via covid supposed fucking horrific, granted cannot actual emotional level 'care' one us care every human, care poor fucker suffering horrific disease hope peace despite u insensitive cunt, would all, imagine, (maybe generalising) share level care towards you. I'm well even sub misinformation description. even changing would nice Rest Peace, Dave... plus side this, whatever reason, finally got idiot grandmother start wearing masks... thank you, Dave... thumbnail kinda disturbs lol ...who angry world lives mom‚Äôs basement, cries pizza rolls, desperately tries make world feel shitty feels himself. comment history indicates people asking question. Go away. infectious lower thresholds LESS infectious? Vietnam gone full Communist arent sure transmission airborne not. Given mask use shown help, seems transmission isnt primarily airborne.

But without knowing that, uncertainty. Sounds promising can't say disagree anything said, seem like fair comparison me. complicated issue believe simplified adults making sacrifices children. need handled different considerations. certain check positivity charges!

COVID-19 loves Georgia loves Governor Kemp.

Btw Kemp signed bill make delivery alcohol legal.He can‚Äôt mandate statewide mask requirement ok?

I feel I‚Äôm living prequel idiocracy. Oh even worse, anti-maskers say mask reason got sick. Apparently masks bacteria breathe make us sick. Another one virus ""activated"" wearing mask.. Everytime I've seen anyone trying make arguments, wonder they're washing masks often enough much bacteria growing making sick? Tell vote ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù said except places community spread, almost US now. Thank taking time write assessment. Living US (where misinformation spreads much quicker Covid) hear much causes confusion.

People know trust, first hand knowledge, tell things contradict, knowing particular incidents rare examples, part ""larger conspiracy"" (oh brother) battles reason lost.

Thanks perspective. *further erode. Lets pretend democracy. Like 300 lbs Americans saying healthy wearing mask.
Mask matters pandemic. Believing really lacking critical thinking skills common sense It‚Äôs like condom! need explain condom well?? Ok disagree -24 post -485 RISD? Crazy people try justify numbers, 1% US population infected many deaths. bother everyone degree. going anywhere X mas 500 000? Thats crazy.

That's oddly specific, it? c c p? Selfish cynical, 10%. Undereducated overopinionated, 30%. 60% normal people scared confused, and, confronted sudden crisis many moving pieces complicated bits, numerous competing narratives... shut down.

Plus, teachers share toilets, congregate rooms together plan, also going lunch together everyday. 

Forcing teachers come teach empty room ridiculous there‚Äôs global pandemic highly contagious respiratory (and argue, airborne) virus going around. It‚Äôs going major problem, I‚Äôm afraid. Teachers getting sick kids even get there. keeping masks times since they‚Äôre sharing air, people don‚Äôt follow protocols correctly hear consequences later. quite unlikely covid december, estimation almost like science situation developed since and, like good scientist, Fauci adjusted recommendations accordingly. get hit truck carrying COVID-19 probably also body means battle infection. people risk groups hit much harder.

This naive unresponsible view thing effect sick get, depends others do, killing lot people.

""masks work"", ""i know anybody that's it, must hoax"", etc. cunt! Lol prison rape funny. Normal rape funny, prison rape lul. think he‚Äôs referring this: Betteridge rule save click: NO.

Also, almost always applies: article starts question, usually answered no, also frequently clickbait. players choose opt in, I‚Äôm fine it. 
 
The issue NFL trying hide it. like call people names tell grow up. It‚Äôs trumps fault 80 year old died  Remember state governments decided shutdowns/lockdowns thing required. What's effective going mask on? going all. tears. Thanks sorry deal sick result.

A couple questions hope dont mind answering is.. second infection worst, better severity first initial infection ?

Was periods illness subtle, mild severe long first second infection ? coworkers get infected ?

Do think PPE protocols place helped minimize severity infection minimizing viral exposure ?

Thanks putting health line help others. thing could make murican would used ar15 instead. he‚Äôs become *onry≈ç* (vengeful spirit) exact vengeance upon wronged him! Wear facemask placate wrath!  can't believe still masks USA Germany mask mandatory shopping public transportation months. Americans. Always blaming others first one later last. show study antivaxxers Help gene pool torpedo boat. Christ people idiots. GI bill serves wonderful purpose. Americans give government years life go college free, better option not. 
 
I think incredibly unfair don‚Äôt really choice path college, assume better take advantage. wish military portion optional totally get frustration / hostility kinda thing makes wonder life ""after"" this. Like sure already polarized political beliefs *maybe* could see past ways get long people. feel like longer goes people die deeper animosity go people / wear masks. 

Like years covid behind us (I hope) find someone met wear masks bridge uncrossable. like telling they're Nazi rapist etc. really wonder impact kinda thing might ability unified people this. Idk I'm articulating well hope get I'm saying. Mental illness hits ages....and really, lot people locked several months since March....some lost jobs...no excuse bad behavior....but explains lot. state saw mostly YOUNG violent protests....protesting crime. I've exactly YELLED ""store clerks"" (mostly CSR phone), person angry legitimate complaint....well, people let opinion known......the videos see here, Youtube venues extremes.....
I entitled observations opinions, yours. He‚Äôs 80 death sad actual evidence anti masker whoever caused death. It‚Äôs virus that‚Äôs killed him. everything right should‚Äôve fine, maybe should‚Äôve self isolated knows. flu season happens don‚Äôt blame others here? trump literally sit mans house cough him? should‚Äôve honoured obituary Always been. full obituary available? lot people trully think democracy means voting every X years. Well, well, that's price pay minimal taxes pay. earn good times oh boy, bad times hit america hard NY intentionally obscures number nursing home deaths.  died hospital, it‚Äôs nursing home death!   I've combo white family members complaining pandemic BLM protests last weeks. Impossible reason stupid used flannel inside, different weave tightly woven dress shirt material used layer. Containment purpose. Nah Save aggressively! Get weird it. Saving 75%+ income, possible, totally changes life decade Mine made RISD grad yeah, trust hers. It‚Äôs made according best practices: dense thread count, 100% cotton, two layers, overlapped folds inside outside layers, fits wiithout much gapping sides.

The one pictured doesn‚Äôt look good. overlapped folds. whatever reason, people like love reference countries completely different United States terms population, population density, number travelers visiting year. United States different country Taiwan Singapore, got it? Singapore less 6 million people, United States 340 million people much heavily visited year. Apples oranges, idiot. People like don‚Äôt know anything scientific virus spreads, want blame people different political views own. Grow up. Sorry autocorrect yeah meant petri dishes virus infectious enough resurgence inevitable live society minimal level interaction others required sustain life. think people disservice suggesting simply wearing mask socially distancing definitely 100% going solution. We're seeing big resurgences countries things suggest solution way effectively US. could be? think _petite fetishes_. Agreed mostly. 
 
The rhetoric 1% needs focus .01% net worth, earned income. people paying highest federal tax rates concern. folks paying 20% cap gains, effective rates 10% earning 7-8 figures passively. We're watching play senate right now.

I think folks realize significance moment either. short term, genuinely setting groundwork real societal changes. stopgap measure til ""it goes away"", one going staying power. isn't. ethical ask people. ‚ÄúThis particular pandemic one where, don‚Äôt think nationwide there‚Äôs single fatality 25. whatever reason doesn‚Äôt seem threaten, know, kids,‚Äù -Rona DeathSantis That's part it. Also, small personal scale, know couple anti mask women wear masks want cover faces think they're beautiful. I'm. Not. Joking! 

One lip injections insists showing off, spend money expensive makeup want faces cover go out. Selfish, vain bitches care make people sick. that's couple people know, know widespread aspect may be. work? Sure. McDonald‚Äôs? grocery store? Lol yeah right You‚Äôre right. seem absurd.

However, neither us ever lived kind pandemic, point, don‚Äôt know indoor dining really even good idea. may be. like overweight obese people saying fat shape people get sick... like, dude, fat dont exercise. see lot risk people telling people risk, them.

Part problem pandemic doesnt hit everyone equally suppose Thank clarification. mean old soviet union, current day Russia understand America stop virus. Instead going war virus, going war masks. feel like I'm stuck surreal time. said ""swedens neigbours much smaller care debt. Sweden 70k, Denmark friends napkin math, 30k half population, Norway, 64k half population. would sa sweden good bad neighbours alts posting comment everywhere one idea history humanity. hospitals. fair, makes think FHM read scientific literature? would find highly probable keep recent research, keep mind published papers necessarily makes science specific subject settled established. Two persons read body scientific literature come different conclusions. necessarily mean one wrong.

For example, first link authors restricted health care providers, obviously quite problematic group extrapolate results general public from, authors acknowledge. Health care professionals trained experienced using face masks, kind makes results line expect. Thinking would go general public frankly conjecture.

As second paper, really nothing indicates reduced face touching due face masks specifically, results cannot achieved means. FHM example quite adamant recommendation people touch faces. can't see anything paper says effects seen cannot replicated using methods, say recommendations avoid touching face example. seems course chosen USA. still months away, every one may worst month far. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Well, Sweden‚Äôs trend points downwards. Denmark‚Äôs up. 

Sure, going 100 cases 200 cases isn‚Äôt bad going 1000 2000, don‚Äôt take measures, 2000 pretty soon, I‚Äôm seeing anything Danish government curb development. Again, opening isn‚Äôt going cut it. 

The virus totally indifferent politics great intentions. child picks things fast, sure that's option.  However many kids need extra help/attention teachers trained work them. lot times that's reason parents even choose homeschool teachers can't burn subjects fast enough kids already know material.   example kids already proficient reading kindergarten others struggle 2nd grade. Makes sense then.  *is* possible OD vitamin D, need take excessive amounts it. shelf, 2000 IU pills safe take every day supplement, even without known deficiency. 

Note vitamin fat soluble, taken food (ideally greasy food) best effect, double teamed something like fish oil. Taking empty stomach water effective. fortunate, lot things right, especially start.

We seeing increase cases too. mandating masks seems like don‚Äôt believe work well research, medical professionals, lead believe. believing something factually untrue. clearly evident major religions (arguably all) cults. Thinking person deity loves without proof existence common shizophrenia cases.

It‚Äôs clear outset haven‚Äôt done research actually understand schizophrenia works. someone knows diagnosed schizophrenic I‚Äôll tell right pop culture understanding paranoid schizophrenia help form coherent argument here.

Schizophrenic delusion characterized profound inability question boundaries one‚Äôs perceived experience objective reality. delusions often lack coherent narratives present profound inability function daily life without disturbance mental crisis. 

Schizophrenic delusion often involves hallucinations generated malfunctions neurotransmitter uptake secretion possibly other, less well studied malfunctions brain. 


Now, latch ‚Äúinability question‚Äù reflective perception religious belief, take minute think critically:

There famous religious individuals who‚Äôs alleged experiences sound awful lot like hallucinations. individual scale, certain ‚Äúmystical‚Äù experiences could likely schizophrenic.

These experiences differ vast majority religious experience practice. average religious person dramatic, hallucinogenic mystical experiences. people spend whole lives trying discern life experiences meet religious criteria divine influence guidance whatever want call it, ones ordinary chance ones may never know due personal biases ambiguity. typical religious person goes least one lifelong periods questioning criticism perceived experience. 

Some-many- religious people insecure admit outsiders sometimes even fellow believers. Especially people belonging toxic, repressive doctrines.

 grappling doubt coming best critical understanding ones life experiences part process maturing lot religious practices.

If someone comes conclusion certain points life relationship something metaphysical disagree them, mean experiencing delusion clinical sense. simply means disagree, even correct qualify experience anything like clinical delusion. 

Armchair psychology doesn‚Äôt look good someone professing enlightened people who‚Äôs outlook criticizing. actively discourage questioning thesis use confusing doctrines leave believes unsure thus obedient.

This also true religions even most. cult like repressive doctrines. religions (like mine) periods profoundly repressive leadership. 

But many religions, including mine, encourage questioning investigation part process maturing becoming intellectually morally active person. Mine require questioning personal research, someone doesn‚Äôt question considered perpetual state ‚Äúpre-adolescent ‚Äù belief, means meant shame people stage also proscribed way go it.

 religion might say ‚Äúthis doctrine aren‚Äôt going change believer disagree examination.‚Äù 

religions change based individual dissidence one believer. change collective evolution theology schism.

But synonymous repressing thought investigation. 

I question you, get information religions, specifically doctrines philosophy? think confused. COVID 100% able airborne aerosols. 

We know already. cant live long air like Measles, needs living host sorts. Thus seeing infect people much surface contact. However, aerosols keeping alive longer. Findings show linger air 30 minutes, could longer shorter sure yet. meant ironically bad :D Yeah agree. dogs aren‚Äôt contact people. sniff odor samples (underarm, urine, etc). dumbass generation headlines article. wonder pandemic bad, everyone stupid. Good info, thank you! Weird reviews. Bamboo tp general great. I've tried several brands think they're good. lmao He‚Äôs Royal Rumble/Wrestlemania twice yearly schedule like ‚Äúbrother‚Äù. No?

Also like 60% educational outcome variance outside school? hard help kids thrive working two jobs without health insurance. think right. virus remarkably unaffected disbelief. dogs don‚Äôt come contact people odor samples containers won‚Äôt infect dogs. 

Even so, dogs seen mild infections cases dying Covid. Snooki want smush smush! they‚Äôre simpletons, and/or don‚Äôt enjoy life home. live Rhode Island usually go shopping area cluster it‚Äôs closer me. 

They *refuse* wear masks stores. I‚Äôve driving extra ten minutes go grocery shopping RI feel safe part Connecticut. Whenever venture CT, see *at least* one adult throwing temper tantrum wearing mask five others aren‚Äôt. add, many Trump, ‚Äúblue lives,‚Äù confederate flags area. tried calling Hawthorne Wipes? Norway, Denmark Finland hasnt proven fundamentally corrupt like Sweden has. peer reviewed study Dr. F saying congress Moreso factor steroid Hydro? post reeks privilege many parents actually rely school lieu childcare work. Smart dude. wish everyone country much respect virus do. No, based extrapolations one source could find. again, sources probably indicates big problem. Rich people Look pictures countries nationalities. Apparently hard parts population wear correctly (Germany wonderful examples, UK well Ive seen). remember reporter questioning Tegnell face masks, touching drawing face mask sitting fucking press conference ( )

Yes, people stupid. conclude ""Swedes incapable"" beyond comprehension... Norway half population almost many canceled operations sweden. reasoning, shut everything down.

By reasoning, letting kids accompany outside activity like shopping social distanced outings public venue ""letting children get infected""

You can't ways. science says. No, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm talking social distancing context established coronavirus. reject trying change name. gives shit it‚Äôs called‚Äîyou obviously knew meant. I‚Äôd also argue skipping cousin‚Äôs wedding much important wearing mask anyway. people keep putting masks, washing hands, social distance stuff, flu transmission rate also plummet, like we've seen Australia.

umm, America'd lately mean, agree. It'd nicer every single thing post mass reported side debate able branch beyond machine translations. so... right. since Trump show Glenn Jacobs aka Kane takes trips year go perform. thing is, welding people really couple cases done zealous local management
 people constant quarantine breakers, many countries (including us) people sent jail. Personally I'd rather stuck home go jail. post leading question like actually means something, perpetuating myth normal, really wasn't. think lost IQ points reading that.

It‚Äôs sad scary consider losing Mom (also 70s) imagine pain family feels. New Jersey native take garbage attitude back Jersey. go stop testing duh Technically, President. problem. many unfilled jobs. giving bonuses people people would go jobs. However right many jobs cant get filled people actually make unemployment. ultimately achieve nothing 30k Denmark half swedish population. heirsay. 3500 years error Research finding surface transmission pretty rare COVID. massive outcry touching contaminated surfaces back March came people assumed germ like nature. 

IIRC, top research labs infectious diseases US finding overwhelming majority cases person-to-person contact coughing, sneezing, breathing. 

This case since beginning too, white house muffled CDC hard many people idea.

At point definitely concerning, ""skyrocketing"" overdramatized. still much less Sweden, instance. DK hits Swedish conditions, time really worry. dependent upon behaviors people

So opening schools massively idiotic, especially we're truly less 12 months decent sized vaccine rollout..like we'll kill teachers parents get months classroom school accomplished. someone looking get flu shot usually start giving shots fall? posted proof full shit. important data used historical purposes. far tracking curve, absolutely detrimental included ""positive infection"" category. thinks she‚Äôs ‚Äúa lot life stress related Covid‚Äù now, I‚Äôd wager contracting covid much stressful healthy. needs give head shake act like responsible adult right now.

Personally physically sending hospital hiring good lawyer giving money earn make sure go jail biological terrorism, attempted murder get charge DEFENDING attempted murder terrorist tried kill virus. 


That people are, biological terrorist treated such. Me: (and yes, adjectives also describe vast majority democrats would literally believe blue green Obama told so).

You: ...that‚Äôs pretty rich considering last 4 years shown us party power, buddy.

Once proving point. Prison? That's reserved peaceful protesters like, amazing cops didn‚Äôt shoot dead right guess answers question. billionaires make money that?

At least agree people lot ignorance mention people get evicted. toooo much - 1 mega pack costco TP last family 4 LONG TIME..do math - 4 People x 1.5 poops x 5 wipes x 3 sheets = 90 sheets day..lets double giggles = 180


The costco 36 pack 1100 sheet rolls last 220 days. assume kind person one night stand say ‚Äúbaby, don‚Äôt need condom me‚Äù start wondering many people said to. think ‚Äúew‚Äù also ‚Äúsigh, going anywhere, it?‚Äù mean do? People taking cruises point either unable unwilling understand fantastically stupid thing do. Politics intermingled crisis. Politics worsening prolonging crisis. I'm sick too, answer pretend separate stop talking it.

Trump, republican party whole, much reason horrible place right crisis. anti-intellectualism, notion ignorance valid medical experts' knowledge, Americans dirty, disease-ridden immigrants country wants crossing borders right now.

We always going lost Americans crisis, politics ignorance killed nearly 160,000 people less year.

So advice, sick political rants Covid-19 intertwined, take break internet instead trying discourage others talking real problems administration fumbling crisis. Agreed! nutters EB aside, mostly say: normal people feeling like bit 'weird' overkill really feeling comfortable it. 

I also think quite smart SST/SSI draw process due this. helps people get accustomed it. 

It reminds bit back late Feb. / early Mar. *quite* upset like *why dragging feet? please lock now!* retrospect, DEAD correct take bit time get everyone used idea timing good could been. People were, think, cooperative strict NPIs came mid March, early March primed accept them. 

I think may setting another well timed public health initiative here! surprised. everyone sees things American anti-China/Russia point view. Honestly yes agree America probably refuse vaccine. GL know, people ""wearing mask"" around neck actually covering anything lol Sure countries, know schools reopen safely in-person learning communities low rates COVID-19 spread appropriate precautions taken.1,2

Source 1: May 15th 2020, uses China/Denmark/Norway/Singapore/Taiwan examples. China multiple outbreaks schools since, Singapore Taiwan. 

Source 2: 15 countries, Norway Denmark opened without observable increase cases. others unknown increases cases.

You'll also notice nowhere say, 'if follow guidelines get sick', [because that's impossible suggestion know Notice says, 'in countries low rates transmission'. Anyone got nonpaywall this? people making decisions personally effected, okay. thought MLB restart disaster, wait shitshow private schools? Yet endangering others punished still denied treatment, whether they're injured process killing someone driving drunk hurt prison.

Seems logic anyone danger society denied care benefits rest us enjoy. agree system big problem, far, see specific shooting good example it. ‚ÄúAmericans exceptionally... stupid, selfish, etc‚Äù explanation doesn‚Äôt cut me. people without paid sick leave decide getting families kicked street going work sick spreading virus, people make decision didn‚Äôt make choices. uninsured people walking around, even shutdowns. easy choices either. American people dumb selfish people, worse options table choose between.

I know people habit considering Americans exceptional, around assure exceptionally anything. [Bill Hicks pretty good bit Thank crazy Eric! went got test, results take 2-3 days. Waiting hear back job approval quarantine results coming PPE. I‚Äôm wearing mask using sanitizer often. Miami Dade county made masks mandatory (even outdoors, nothing lol), they're stringently enforcing new mandates closing businesses break rules. That, plus good ol' delaying PCR test results due extreme demand seems like reasonable answer. Well said. Tennessee, Dr Birx came gave speech front governor media state needs slow down. went podium said going trust Tennesseans make right decisions. asked bars closed face masks mandated. Exactly. lack education rectified. date, way rectify death.

Consensus? Like peer review process? think already process place Yes, do. really understand much damage could cause. pandemic also taught I'm progressive actually was. I'm lucky I'm engineer still employed (for now). really feel people recently unemployed. people hit hardest low income families messed Congress (the republicans) extend $600 per week UI. Really shameful need Cultural Revolution order it. less public health disease control window dressing show ""doing something"". Onlyfans girls count lol Agreed there! speculation without mentioning probability outcome pointless. 

""What wedding gets canceled every single family member dies day mass shooting?"".

Sure, could happen. likely happen. distinction possible probable important one. Smart alive would even better, US stopped prioritizing education long time ago. Even better - elope, save money, put education fund kids. Fascinating bought 2x 4 gallon jugs bleach economy pack paper towels. Already empty spray bottles. Cost $15. run year least. I'm bashing teachers. used one. mean taken way. sounds like lot experience support delivering lessons. Also, teach older kids. That's great! teachers frustrated distance learning experience. youngest zoom lessons, one us parents available instant ensure locate correct file/link/web site etc. 

I good internet plenty devices house. Even three wifi access points signal drops hard-to-reach parts house inexplicably. know households everyone family shares one device. includes parents trying work home. Also, great wifi access. defending statement? really possibly argue good faith online learning shift lot financial time burden parents? Common sense says no.

Again, understand teachers everything make work. Thank service. Everyone thinks ‚Äúit can‚Äôt happen me!‚Äù like understand ""correct"" ""disingenuous"" mean. I'm disagreeing replied to. Indiana counties interview ""good reason "" per school system hybrid classes. Otherwise go face face shitty virtual academy. case means student going full virtual outside school system potentially missing honors orchestra, student council, advanced classes would offered accepted planned taking. 

Idk, get it. lessons going online anyway teachers make available both, hoops? game chicken? yikes, actually think covid-19 hoax? Yup, 10 minutes, whether Michigan, Rutgers, Kent State, matter time. Students drunkenly come rolling 10 minutes prior kickoff American people fall three categories:

1.) Anti-maskers.

2.) People make exceptions rules feelings. 
*‚ÄúThey‚Äôre children, would cruel make wear masks.‚Äù* 
*‚ÄúI‚Äòve stayed months. need crowded sweaty social event. ‚Äù*

3.) people scared enough follow rules time. 
Who know virus doesn‚Äôt care feel deserve.

The kids going believe parents believe. Best case scenario, parents disciplined careful. school reopening betting LOT lives impulse control children. going irrational aggressive point can't conversation anyone, feel sad you.

I hope dont routinely fall argument popularity fallacy, voting people disagree make wrong.

I hate special pleading arguments. People inconsistent, biased bigoted drives batty.

I grew poor worked manual labor I'm sure makes ""class traitor"".

Grow up. support welfare poor. 

I want anyone contributing plague spreading practices. help spread plague care rich poor, religion are, small business big business. know, right. think taking temperatures OK, far tell tale sign someone coronavirus they're contagious. mean poor, rual areas. people work land. can't afford education get shit ""intellectual"" journalists like breeds animosity divide. Immunity instant vaccine. really need start stressing people attitude get instantly get sick. Improve less testing lol üòÇ It‚Äôs expensive cancel weddings. people likely put ton money it. said, don‚Äôt feel bad someone gets Covid19. making necessary adjustments. Yeah, let's go camping global pandemic. Sounds good. Maybe Jesus protect us something. Economic suffering death, real affect people's lives. pretend otherwise foolish.

Reopening schools normal times without risk. teacher going killed car accident driving school ever exposed COVID-19. life matters too, we're perfectly willing ""sacrifice"" make society better whole. Trump replaced FMLA something better yet? nation could collectively come together sort fund intent ensuring ensures children basic needs met. Lets say basic needs food, shelter, healthcare, education?

Maybe someday - next month. much life? 1 year? quality-adjusted life-years? know presidents often parts Oscar-baity type movies...trump deserve one ""... peaked high school.""

State local governments need act right limit spread, give shit economy. could get behind that. One things sure. It‚Äôs horrible. really applies 3 months snows northeast. rest fall cold, snow, unless live mountains female Jewish medical expert.

A true triple-whammy. Anchor man: Mamaluigi70 arrested today, immediately released ""people see shit."" Duh. Every state fudging numbers (underreporting cases). difference rich Californians, Texans, Floridians, Chicagoans, New Yorkers literally move ""less infected"" states one gives shit. 

That's America you: money first, humanity distant second. lockdown much? Freakin hell.

138 days far. Cases increasing government keeps playing fooling us. totally insane. *Shocking* Shouldn‚Äôt always think ahead, pandemic important? Trump would equally corrupt, incompetent dishonest without it. think classified respiratory cardiovascular disease. African Americans make 6 percent California‚Äôs population, 8.3 percent state residents dying¬†

Is statistically significant? one guy even child. Florida man dick. Great reply.   People shitting education really understand opportunities give take advantage it

Edit: School also responsible trying teach everything one prepared future lives, sometimes one take responsibility learn taxes, finance, physical education, etc.  don‚Äôt think anyone even knows you‚Äôre talking about. exactly steps ‚Äúto make bodies handle viruses better?‚Äù doctor, tell people cannot prepare bodies this, unless you‚Äôre talking losing weight, increasing overall fitness quitting smoking (but won‚Äôt see effects many months). really proven methods prevent spread decrease community infection rates social distancing, widespread mask usage, better hygiene practices. teaching police de-escalation away ""it's either kill killed"" mentality they're often taught. believe many, deadly situations would better served de-escalation. believe de-militarization de-funding police hiring (maybe even within police departments) social workers, mental health workers, drug rehab, etc. anything, I'd err towards Sweden side justice system.

That said, watched video several times really know I'd ever different reaction officers fired him. waited pulled gun fired twice close quarters. really cover get. shot him, there's good chance officer would hit. might make case aiming different body part, police officers training hit center mass head harder miss hit someone else.

I think possible would given white man benefit doubt maybe would yelled drop gun something, view much instinctual reaction anything nefarious.

I agree this:
‚ÄúI thought highly inappropriate really shocking one give community answers way engage,‚Äù said Tristan Taylor, Detroit Breathe. ‚ÄúWe know fact video would released day.‚Äù

We absolutely need independent police oversight actual teeth accountable voters. insanity sheriffs decide uphold law actively violate nothing seems change needs stop ASAP. happened George Floyd absolutely unforgivable never happen again. like lot faith humanity hit really hard.

But think different far, think case shooting unjustified. Still open discussion, hate say...you probably watch video dozen times first. fact seeing someone die, there's ton disturbing happens. moves quickly see way officers. approved effective coronavirus person spent 3.5 hrs last night school board meeting zoom call might insight.

There ""my kid needs social interaction"" group. couple feature crying child entering frame begging school board allow see friends. felt like child's tantrum. ""But want covid anymore!!!""

Wtf living thru wonder Japan get lucky again. 

The treatment corona getting better. Japan needs let get point healthcare system get overburden corona patients. adequate sick leave, concerned me.

My wife works urgent care benefits all, despite highest risk possible. actively collects covid test specimens dozens patients every day, yet sick leave. know wealthy capitalist industrialist told many states reopened early. expecting say that, expecting Elon Musk type attitude. suppose beneficial quarantine mitigated rush reopen. still live die economic devastation. would level playing field two-worker families.

Good luck trying make life fit bullshit notions. think wrong person resigned live this. wish miracle happen corona vanish lives. waiting vaccine. Covid nowhere near leading cause death peoples family members. sounded like naming random things cause devastation mental health. Anecdotal evidence evidence anecdotes: evidence collected casual informal manner relying heavily entirely personal testimony.

When compared types evidence, anecdotal evidence generally regarded limited value due number potential weaknesses. qualify scientific evidence, nature prevents investigated scientific method.

Similarly, psychologists found due cognitive bias people likely remember notable unusual examples rather typical examples. Thus, even accurate, anecdotal evidence necessarily representative typical experience. Accurate determination whether anecdote typical requires statistical evidence. Misuse anecdotal evidence informal fallacy sometimes referred ""person who"" fallacy (""I know person who...""; ""I know case where..."" etc.) places undue weight experiences close peers may typical. No, actually us serfs go back work start making money billionaire class. Seriously. Especially covid data sent hhs cdc. knows real number could be. even worse say fuck continue mismanage global pandemic. already experimented false dichotomy shutdown vs economy lesson need control covid else economy everyone suffer longer. Another case Argument ignorance favorite think people realize bad is.

My grandma's internet, ""DSL"", slower dial-up twenty years ago suburbs. nearest relay box 13 miles house. It'd need 3 miles away get we'd expect shitty DSL speeds. can't use Siri wifi, times out. takes half hour email load, text-only.

Even dial-up shittier city dial up, runs longer phone lines decades older.

""Just use cell!"" omfg, cell either. One bar flit across phone handful times day. good, text come five minutes. bad, take day send receive text. Forget data, can't even make phone call.

And satellite blows too, caps, unreliable, super expensive.

Internet needs treated like utility. Ideally decade ago we'd already infrastructure, now's great time too. whole situation sucked rural students pandemic, completely untenable. Well TIL guess. impression isn‚Äôt common Europe otherwise healthy adults. sure every country obviously. Lifelong DINK here. much recently; lives sooo much easier. Regrets. good lump Democrats group. obviously want National strategy. Yeah get upset deaths low day. choke chicken high death numbers doom. complicated. beginning countries used masks. realized month later, also realized people would it, instead opted try introduce gradually. things aren‚Äôt beach. precautions thinking? three feet come from? Studies showing six feet sufficient without mask. 

Let's forget Indiana tried pass law declaring pi (the mathematical constant) would 3.2 (vice value 3.14159...). Plus Florida reporting less hurricane, I‚Äôm sure finished yet, Texas software updates testing centers deal people try tell COVID liberal agenda make trump look bad destroy America?

Edit: legitimate question, getting downvoted? You‚Äôre right, key beating virus tiny island nation side planet earth. God Trump would use giant friggen lasers saw Canada Mexico propel us pacific. I‚Äôm want Biden. ""Many wipes made polyester spunlace, material currently short supply also used make personal protective equipment like masks, medical gowns medical wipes""

And claim you‚Äôre teacher ... smh honest, understand military unit AK47. durable gun cost-efficient weapon great firepower. Even ~50 years introduction, serves well ammunition logistics remain laughably easy. 

Come M16 fans. erase ‚Äúalive‚Äù part shootings. specifically say Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

An isolated area would safe COVID. people go isolated areas, they'll safe. *everyone* wants go isolated areas safe, they're longer isolated thus longer safe. Helen...? Helen!?! thought told would rather dumb alive educated dead! dead parents. one saying suitable substitute entire life education. could certainly suitable one year. think understand VR works. could simulate entire classroom tactile feedback.

It‚Äôs disturbing think traditional education one-size fits solution. fails children time. hey keep saying blanket statements like it‚Äôs hopeless don‚Äôt solution. really comment comes whitehouse either total lie guesswork Sort chicken egg thing though isn‚Äôt it? violent asshole ready snap lost job kid, losing job kid maybe he‚Äôs angry, violent asshole who‚Äôs always ready snap? Well mean...yes no. Consistently they‚Äôve said need presence exposure least 5 15 minutes. That‚Äôs doctors get sick people grocery store getting Uber Eats whatever don‚Äôt Regressing also means progressing agree Agree. Sorry sometimes activist angry side wants point fucked stuff. also shouldnt let kids go back school yet. actually develop awesome courses best educators. Though may hurt bad teachers think it'll help make kids want learn ask questions, could probably courses kids want actually learn about, teachers teach cool people good want share kids ever round real third world slump know really misery ?
Jesus, people American centric even know first world privilege . mAh MiLiTaRiEs! Teachers would able effectively take precautions. perfect better messing education millions kids Extrovert here. I'm fortunate I've got job requires get house somewhat regularly (HVAC testing/inspecting/consulting labs hospitals primarily) I'd much tougher time it. wife gone camping far, we've one back yard gathering 10 people good social distance masking up. Luckilly we're area people following rules by-and-large infection rates low now. go Houston TX back Late May/early June work people taking things nearly seriously. Sure enough shortly came back home TX started spiraling. 

But yeah, tough. miss going concerts hanging friends family, gotta gotta do. buddies trying learn play D&amp;D online right get bit social fix. bother justification. would show aggressive looking mug shot. 

This privilege action. every time, general. Arizona hospitals full crooks lying three weeks straight downtrend hospitalizations.

Dr Carson entitled opinion facts. Sam's Club, plenty Clorox wipes hand every time go aisle, there's Member's Mark hand sanitizer available since early March. walked optometrist office secretaries masks clients. feel like lot types would keep day Man really hate FL ppl. Young kids learn interacting humans, frankly suggest VR would suitable substitute disturbing. may necessary present, it‚Äôs lesser two evils right now. really said it. Aside confusion arising mixed messaging, botched handling virus country, instability uncertainty arisen pandemic, I've really also hit hard seeing utter selfishness people, including people family (anti-maskers hoaxers). 

I'm really sensitive sometimes, maybe overrepresented reporting something, even social media, see people unable give single damn others saddening.

The crazy thing is, level understand inclination... get one life seems like goes fast sometimes. time, can't see potentially prematurely ending someone else's life I'm reckless selfish pursuit enjoy mine. people infected, dying, dead numbers scoreboard acceptable losses seeing people treat like sad. 5000 cases would data 7-12 days ago takes long test results come back Florida.Will see later week/early next week effects little testing Florida site testing shutdowns Eh past three days county health department posting lower positive infections 40% posted state county. Maybe area, WinCo wipes spray, Walmart lots spray.  books means ""vulnerable able harmed by."" context ability catch absolutely means. certainly mean ""will definitely kill them"", seem think. Wait, we‚Äôre comparing state United States country now? Also ignoring state landlocked, free open borders, interstate travel rest United States fraction size Australia?

If America, would probably cautious though crazy number cases. definitely logistical nightmare. already admit transportation hybrid option, answering parent questions regarding bussing day students ""Just bear us, figured yet."" reasoning? state millions cases reported cases reinfection, highly unlikely reinfections factor. There's premise conclusion, sounds like reasoning me. think follows, think right data yet.

You disagree want to, think minimum need year's worth data get better handle reinfection. need study subpopulations high risk re-exposure adequate rates testing. parents whether want send school not. know choice, rather forcing idiotic opinions everyone else.  thankfully, something tells nothing value ruined Unfortunately turtles way down. bet ISPs claim expensive suppliers/labour, suppliers claim same. right. Look countries see lot done lot less.. inputs cheaper too. Doesnt mean it'll always exist form Indiana. Holy crap another state that's gone backwards far last 20 years Tennessee expect testing rate dropped despite positive rate still near 18%. There's something odd going numbers yesterday 40% drop monday someone said ""oh monday"" (which makes sense that's comparing monday monday before).  


 ""the Republican president widely criticized handling pandemic. Republicans likely believe that, example, scientists media exaggerating seriousness virus. United States Democratic president criticized his/her handling pandemic, Democrats would believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories, said study‚Äôs author"" Oof homeschool basically devil. alternative potential death... happy send vodka Headlines hinting overstating effectiveness something probably little effect simply irresponsible dangerous. 

I really understand argument that. know might late sorry already said, however,

Even weren‚Äôt middle pandemic, wouldn‚Äôt smart kind. wouldn‚Äôt 2 years ago. titles always feel like exaggeration.

We're still talking country around 40k confirmed cases TOTAL. 10k cases active.

Yes, significantly worse Asian countries similar populations population densities.

But man feel like people enjoy dunking Japan, despite countries like India adding Japan's TOTAL covid count, PER DAY. something wrong medulla oblong a? Yes hospitals can‚Äôt discharge people rehab test positive even minimal amount. probably depends family situation. friend two girls home agrees development/relationship/mental health front. neighbor extended family arrangement truly enjoying family time creates - lifetime summer memories whole mess siblings cousins in-laws adults working two jobs. saying that, please read carefully future. saying rise mental health issues seen recently direct response Covid-19 infections. name calling anyone calls it.

Your response is, really mean this, baffling me. Plus, people know difference flu symptoms COVID add burden system too. correct idealistic take offense. idea akin Roddenberry (star trek) utopia requires automaton surplus full force. I‚Äôm hopeful beginning stages something like developing I‚Äôm merely describing possible psychological social effects stress working live wonders could create population would flourish without it.

Sorry rambling thank reply!  Likely much Lower world thinking fucking way.  lots them. I'm going 49 year. I'm young many people age die, respiratory issues already. get Covid survive either health wise, financially considering income supports 4 adults. mad government forcing suffer financially global pandemic. adequate response, like almost every first world country, live performances would running again. great news. seems like viral load affect severity infection, part limit exposure, severity contagions go down, thus limiting hospital care deaths. shit, Sherlock. get septic tank pumped every years...but never put chemicals come ass.

our well never required chemical treatment, either. good coughing sneezing. I'm sure sensible enough self-isolate showing symptoms. presumably breathing out, speaking, occasionally laughing? things spread droplets infect people. could feel fine start showing symptoms tomorrow, still shedding virus today.

And, yes, make feel better seeing people wearing masks, I'd rather believe live society people care respect one people selfish, thoughtless uncaring. Headlamps substitute good driving I'd still rather drove well *and* used headlamps.  reopened schools completely, cramming 38 kids classes, without masks hot days, high schools included. Also reopened everything else time. Despite single death child Israel. still reopen schools school year starts, younger kids keeping high schools remote learning since deadlier older kids. nat geo article discusses differences viral persistence, relapse reinfection.

It strikes likely case viral persistence although can‚Äôt sure point Get crazy person here! .... comparing someone‚Äôs professional sports salary someone service worker likely working pay check pay check... nice. difference NFL players don‚Äôt play, aren‚Äôt going starve. crappy thing say. Children less likely die. It‚Äôs adults pass virus that‚Äôs problematic. sure understand. referring mark beast, regard Trump?

Funny enough, people fact worked mark beast, [with regard Bill Gates/vaccine conspiracy rather Trump. guess antichrist detectors dialed highest sensitivity, well-tuned.

*Edit: Oh! MAGA hats?* worry though, numbers continue go US they're falsified. Ask WH real figures. Average age death 80. Young people greater risk dying flu. Chill Yeah, live near boundary suburban county, almost shopping errands there. everyone suburban areas masks maintaining distance. rural areas small towns, consistent all. lot locally owned businesses mask-optional even people masks on, they're maintaining distance. believe threat. Schools opening. know what‚Äôs going happen, sir. need see therapist asap am. understand related polarization? US war, suspect political parties also citizens sides would want nationwide response. different pandemic? issue lot know spread amongst children. seem children 10 unlikely spread virus, studies say older children (around high school age) spread virus similar rate adults. High school aged children also risk group comes isolation. 

It seems allowing elementary aged (and below) children back school would alright, seem like good idea high schoolers. worry adults immunocompromised people high schoolers come contact with, also worry potential long term health damage may come high school aged children. 

Perhaps releasing guidelines combat/spot depression high schoolers prevent potentially high death rate would beneficial. 

The article talks potential discrepancies spread amongst differently aged lot states mask mandates Ontario. got couple weeks ago whereas lot states since April . think US lying numbers handled properly state local leaders give warnings.

That happen. Bad behavior, lack belief science, letting conspiracies misinformation run amok led two factions. group took seriously easily accepted taking protective measures.

Then ""others"". know leaders are. This? fault. salaries. Look much districts spend new bullshit ‚Äúprograms‚Äù every year, much goes things like football stadiums gyms, buying/maintaining laptops every student every couple years, etc. people live Disney never go interact anyone else? risk limited them, perpetuating global health crisis something selfish, that's bottom line.

As far comment: ""The world open point Disney chose now."" fuck reasoning? ""Oh things going well we'll give up."" live give-up America now? How, resources, money, people, education country able solve public health crisis? acceptable response? Things normal right now. People need accept that.

You give saving human lives care them. Disney, one richest brands entire world pays executives millions bonuses, care saving human lives? offering long term medical benefits employees may end lifelong conditions keep bottom line looking black?

Here Disney's mission statement: mission Walt Disney Company entertain, inform inspire people around globe power unparalleled storytelling, reflecting iconic brands, creative minds innovative technologies make world‚Äôs premier entertainment company.

How interpret you, actions seem line mission statement. mean, years worth funding drops better decades funding cuts many kids dying. Yes I, too, support federal government making kind plan least appearing give fuck. know what, let's make priority schedule time set meeting passing appropriations funding explore making plan. I'll stick drinking bleach hear big guy one.

... peanut butter chocolate chip.... We‚Äôve started teacher workdays, straight said expect us shut year point.

Hopefully post-COVID flight suburbs lowers rents, resulting big net gain city cultural standpoint.  forming different conclusions

I explicitly said ""I know opening schools right idea. bunch factors weigh easy."" Europeans, like us! Yea know 5 people makes laugh people sub like pretend Covid death sentence young people. saying covid completely easy potential long term effects young people sub likes act like young people get covid either die debilitating damage whole lives. weird fetish awful consequences, especially literally millions young people recovered completely covid. Duh. Capitalism dying capital fight remain control. students going tragic. countering Carson's 99% figure throw ""It's OK then....""

Edit: Yes, know completely wrong age group well... assume male non-mask wearers small dicks massive insecurity issues leading try appear stupid tough, female non-mask wearers antivax Karens. Either way, hard pass. I've everything recommending, I've concerned whole time speaking nurse covid positive customer I'm little shook. customers scared, could tell nurse trying confident fear voice. young girl obviously crying past 15 minutes got much evident, dude I'm telling straight look like death's door. heard baby crying inside saw husband laying couch, everyone household it. sure can, education reflect entirety South. Deaducated. certain percentage children die COVID. smaller percentage older people, children immune. young people catch it, young people die. get hear 99 age lived.

Its bit like every older person die. Enough old people catch it, see stories 90+ year olds living. get hear 99 age died. He's probably saying distract unrelated things wants sneak in. People area taking precautions, things would normally prove think it‚Äôs fake.... hugging instead shaking hands.... cookouts parties ever.... know flu kills people? FAUCK man streets ahead shortage That‚Äôs really interesting thought. Makes complete sense know women often dismissed. FREEEEEDUUUUUUUMMMMBBBBB sounds amazing! great idea swing it! Couldve swore spelled ‚ÄúNorthern California ‚Äú cause here. Soon: ""The reason rampant spread COVID-19 schools bigly tests. keep telling people slow testing."" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è basing opinion based what? far I've seen statistics, there's still large portion people aged 20-50 getting sick/getting hospitalized/dying warrant throwing room full kids (who known best group spreading bacteria infection). many cases coronavirus disinfectant wipes prevented? doubt worth cost effort.

But transparent. know type arguing opening schools. ever cared children's mental health? cared inequality society's vulnerable? 

They don't. anything addresses except pretend plague exist. one going around stating mental issues caused COVID. 

And one going around throwing insults name calling anyone calls it.

I'm done you. blocked. great response here, wanted say comment concisely sums I'm saving it. try argue sense people I've given least kids etc. Ehhhhhh sure.


I work downtown LA bartender place that's qualified open. People best go disagree. everyone capable taking care extent required keep everyone else safe. Dangerously presumptive, get vote people find odd frankly. respond comment, answer say respond me. even bother commenting? Sounds like mom learned swallow, maybe covid reckoning mistake. 6 year old enjoyed first 1 hour Zoom call class back April, subsequent 30 minute calls chore. Can't sit still. Wants talking whole time. minds age wired it. 

I could imagine starting become effective around Grade 3 4, even talking Grade 8 niece friends, much appetite level either. good news. Lower cases actually bad news. good news would short lived schools going back many children teachers die.

Edit: virus unstoppable, kills everyone path. kill you, wish dead. guy Tuscaloosa infected six friends barbecue. one friend dying said ""I wish wore mask"" ""I listened Donald Trump. trusted take care me...capitalism blame this"" got ‚Äúreinfected‚Äù time? unlucky two get exposed Covid twice 4 months experience ‚Äúreinfection‚Äù time. doomed stuck forever pattern die. vaccine useless them. seems like we're reading stuff, forming different conclusions happen fall sides cautious sending kids back classrooms. I'm well aware present issues corporations, sadly. wish limited United corporatism economic policy parties, core disagreements merely social issues identity politics.

Generally would agree that, recent US elections would also seem dragged ""basic competency"" mix. Thanks explaining anecdotal evidence is. sound smart dude!

You said would sick ""weeks months"". That's objectively wrong. hope fun continuing play Dr.!

edit: Also find hilarious thag cognitive bias. say sub focusing g young people long term sickness covid cognitive bias ignore vast majority young people either mild cases literally symptoms all? Come bro...look mirror. Texas also stopped reporting one day reported backlog following day 2nd day article talking about.  Flu shots available, recommended get September/October maximum efficacy throughout flu season.

For normally get flu shots, consider time. Flu shot protect SARS-CoV-2, might keep clinic hospital overwhelmed patients. Thx reply

I making statement conclusions ppl have. seen sufficient evidence conclude ""the South dumb always be"" yet.

I am, however, making statement evidence ppl put forward support hypotheses. department mean statistic support conclusion strong manner, due representative sample problem. fair multiple reasons. First, observational study controls. One least reliable study types. Second, found one confounding drugs (steroids) _does_ work. took antibiotics ate twinkies infection went away mean twinkies work? case one better.

 Good Luck! conspiracy theory ton people already immunity

This perfectly reasonable idea considered conspiracy theory. theory. hand possible prior infection related coronavirus actually _worsens_ SARS-CoV-2 infection via something like antibody dependent enhancement. Again, idea. little know.  think right. political psychologist interviewed podcast talked conflicting messages medical experts undermining people's confidence them. people turn sources decided trust side with. Many conservative political media leaders saying virus something worry about. listen medical experts all, even seem know what's going on? According political psychologist, there's sort feedback loop increased anxiety makes people turn towards experts, March 2020, people turned political/media leaders convinced less anxious, that, farther path listening political/media voices medical experts. Tested positive exposed two different things. Holy shit, click it!? fucking medians bracket article. Big cities need directly punish landlords offering ""deals"" instead dropping rents (offering 2 months 'free' making remaining months sooooo scummy), leaving spaces empty drop rents, punished issue. Well fair, none us house. It‚Äôs rental chip cost far rent goes, yeah kind say rules are, however I‚Äôm often painted asshole adamant careless pandemic You‚Äôre making leaps here, bud.

I report these, never see mod action clarify things. New Jersey people quite nice. Indeed, comment, I'm confident saying much nicer you. This, much mask-wearing real problem USA. decide supporting family spreading C-19, people end choosing spread instead getting families thrown street. Ah yes. national average. must follow national average else. saying statement ""Americans often ravenous revenge"" inaccurate generalization. Even though conditioned ""very often"" reflects fact US executes people seven countries. Let alone fact incarcerate children, execute mentally ill, incarcerate people even victimless crimes?

Social distancing important masks. adopted bunch children foster care. disabilities. health care workers.

Doctors often interact patients away - giving instructions, explains, evaluating diagnostics, paperwork etc no, hours videos rioters yelling point blank officers law. face. multiple cities. Weeks upon weeks. April worst month, purely death perspective. 60kish deaths average 2k day. june 23k, july 28k, things definitely heading wrong direction.

What need tough laws regarding mask wearing social distancing, police willing enforce laws. want wear mask grocery store, want risk getting sexually assaulted serving prison sentence? people faced choices, bet people wear mask. Lol noticed steering right clear much telling median.

We also insight methodology count ""savings"". well could include employer 401ks piddily amount accessible without significant penalty.

Point huge swaths country nothing hand. Money goes quickly goes in. proposing young people would die flu. crazy shit virus though.   

What never vaccine? age range, astounds women act now. like younger. Even used bully high school, assault people without rhyme reason like that, lashing hostility towards innocent people even know. seems like symptom mental health issue, medication problem.

I noticed, old people take lot pills lose facilities faster old people rely healthy diet activity keep going. someone rocker like that, assume problem medicine cabinet. 

Also, people drink. 

It possible normal sane old age, spent years frying brain cells. like think, teenaged Karen would horrified way old lady Karen acting. fair, tools return break 10 years later. great insight also something guy could question nothing scorns menopausal woman like bringing menopause. mom going seems really rough try best accommodate definitely become short-fused rude gotten older.

As Aug. 3, mainland China 84,464 confirmed coronavirus cases, health authority said. COVID-19 death toll remained 4,634. r/iamatotalpieceofshit COVID pretty consistently kills 1% 1.5% infected people. multiply deaths 100 give likely case count, New York much higher testing shown. mean would rather double mistake?

Stunning cast heartbreaking musical, also positive human experience. Football probably happen year, especially college. really pains say this, unless willing go bubble system like NBA, probably can't play. 

Unfortunately, colleges can't create bubble players. would almost say intentionaly caughing (possible) covid cancer patient, grounds forced sterilisation.
Thats human sort normalcy. agree. add treating COVID-19, first would difficult new. Now, doctors know lot work COVID-19 way they're developing vaccine pretty different. They're even sending test vaccine manufacturers advance avoid typical medical production woes. plan they'll dumo failed vaccine trials come back successful. 

Besides, remember fear sub beginning. Even then, people largely discussed Fall would absolute earliest.

Lastly, know next nothing long term health effects even asymptomatic, young carriers disease trading one unknown another.

Also, at-risk populations better protected now, since understand huge difference impact age groups: nearly 0% mortality kids, 5 10,000 50, vs 1.3% 75.

Published last week. lot people Reddit owe China apology blaming virus China, considering know Europe US also COVID back December, CHina blamed one cared enough investigate. 

Also dominant D614G strain come China, China's strain found Europe/US, groups seeded common ancestor parallel.

Less worried safety, worried it'll ineffective get approved anyways political purposes. I'm worried Trump Republicans destroyed yet another federal agency cost American lives lying works.

They've shown lies selfishness always important American lives. vaccine would different.

They try force vaccine election, whether works not. Cancer patient never get along silent accomplice hateful cause, designed sow division HKers mainlanders, HKers ourselves. wanted bring bipolar bullshit permeates US society infect hometown.

Whatever issues China has, least they're teaching kids lynch murder people disagree with. Aw yes nursing home death sentence avoided Texas. love ‚Äúkill her‚Äù attitude. Typically American. lady exhibited symptoms would lead believe infected something, loaded gun theory makes least little sense.

""general market"" would somehow inherently tied GDP? Since recession specifically based GDP?

The bond market? Borrowing rates? still GDP. 

The Fed's monetary policy tools even close primary drivers GDP. agree first paragraph, size molecules smell significantly smaller lot less testing available back March-May, cases required medical treatment likely cases tested. Moderate cases would told go home self-treat without testing. we're able test large numbers people even showing symptoms.

So basically case case really comparable. testing availability now, NY cases would lot higher.

Edit: Additionally improvements treatments severe cases - turning stomach, remdesivir, steroids, etc  Yeah I'm ok that, similar flu shot, rich occasionally less effective. safe would take Covid vaccine 15% effective.  always thought Gandhi abolished practice. I‚Äôll go ahead end suspense

Pls keep bags reuse them! There's also less social recrimination men. ""Karen"" afraid ending going viral. Men often, less fear that. airborne, less contagious. Covid: 10-20% patients make 80% new infections. Meaning average R 2, R 20% contagious patients must around 10. Maybe he'd lived 100 otherwise.

There's reason walking around mask,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. masks may block droplets, Fauci said, provide level protection people think do. Wearing mask may also unintended consequences: People wear masks tend touch face often adjust them, spread germs hands. people still going Fauci said 3/8/20 [as say parts south, ""aw shucky ducky   thats bullshit , vaccine start effective like month infections last 10-14days wouldnt make sence vaccine already immune people actually someone tell forefathers taught right wear masks.

Also, would research, would see scientists think virus actually December. Anybody thinks virus could properly contained America fucking idiot.

However, would walking around unaware infection (since showing symptoms), therefore they‚Äôd less likely get tested. 7-14 day turnaround time test results (at least state), there‚Äôs good chance they‚Äôd unknowingly pass virus anyone come close contact with. take risk? Wearing mask simple way reducing unnecessary risks like these. Damn, informed? Someone apartment died COVID found months later. What‚Äôs hate? Me: rolls eyes.

The evidence work great quality evidence, higher quality evidence don‚Äôt work well general public settings. bury facts attempt get people wear them, don‚Äôt work well think, opposite effect causing spread people start activities feel wearing mask.

That one reason believe countries higher levels mask wearing like USA, worse luck countries lower levels mask usage like Denmark Canada. initial viral load factor outcome  *They spread 21 different flights, Eindhovens Dagblad reported.*

But still one could get plane. three different independent measures deaths mentioned ones try link daily update, new reports. recent ones (with comparison period 2 weeks behind, hopefully stable numbers):

* [Statistics Sweden released new update preliminary death ; shows Sweden normal mortality rate since 11th July excess mortality compared 2015-2019 order 5054 deaths period 1/3 18/7.
* [The Board Health Welfare also released new update COVID-19 deaths based death ; finds 5527 COVID-19 deaths occurred 1/3 18/7 90% also included reports Public Health Authority. period [FHM 5696 deaths. Note difference based FHM reports deaths people confirmed COVID-19 past 30 days, regardless cause death. really? money, sad.... whos ready start vault tech corporation wake thousand years severity sickness correlated amount virus particles end throat/lungs first place. wearing mask, body probably able deal without needing hospitalized. not, much higher chance dying, severe side effects last rest life. would like able walk stairs anymore? imagine vitamin nothing survival. smile immune systems naturally bolstered fact already live less hygienic environment long they've built stronger defenses people showered daily wash hands regularly. see, talking **region**, country. Lombardy surely devastated, like NYC, Madrid etc. whole country devastated? No, all, that's spread succesfully limited. reflected % people infected, shown article:

 survey found marked local differences northern region Lombardy, epidemic first broke February, showing 7.5% population tested positive coronavirus antibodies compared 0.3% Sicily.

Knowing this, surprising percentage lot higher. Yes? get cut? That‚Äôs like smallpox. scientist working vial, woman floor caught smallpox died it.

BUT one cannot eat wearing mask &amp; local law allows exception.

The men nothing wrong per Manhattan Beach CA law. That's great point - pensions invest commercial real estate reasons they're going get hit big time, too.  severely underfunded face wave retirements coming up. school districts, even distance learning, requiring teachers report schools. Education roots every minute accounted mentality. culture unnecessary meeting upon meeting. wtf full video WDW CM, almost 10 years. family CM‚Äôs. met wife WDW proposed there, probably would gotten married wasn‚Äôt expensive. love parks much, massive part life.

WE OPEN RIGHT NOW

Sure people visiting park choose go there, CM‚Äôs don‚Äôt get choice. It‚Äôs either work risk getting sick passing loved ones, get put medical leave lose insurance benefits unemployment turned work. (I didn‚Äôt even receive unemployment two months finally got DEO, brother got today. work still haven‚Äôt seen cent) 62 year old mother -with brain tumor- go work needs insurance. friend diabetic high risk go work need insurance. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs thousands others similar circumstances. 
We‚Äôre putting lives risk people don‚Äôt identity outside Disney aren‚Äôt taking pandemic seriously pisses off.  dum-dum question. embarassing admit understand this, really want get terrible math statistics.

I watching new Axios interview Trump interviewer going back forth whether correct way report Corona related deaths percentage positive cases result death (according Trump) percentage country's population died result Covid (according interviewer).

What difference make? seems according Trump's way measuring, Covid deaths down, according interviewer's, Covid deaths up. 

To me, seems reporting proportion total population died would give appearance lower mortality rate, due many people never tested factored in.

Can anyone better understanding statistics ELI5 actually works? special cruise (future) Darwin Awards nominees! time see ""suspect arrested"" case like this, know white dude, even there's picture. someone spilled HOT coffee (possibly leaving burns) I‚Äôd say ‚Äúoh well‚Äù. Never trust anyone misspells ""airborne"" multiple times. think expert? maybe espert?  Cowards? Really? Yeah, homeless people thousand bucks disposable income. right now. know people anti-science holy shit. Everyone learns scientific method. Whyyyy questioning science based policies changing based new data!?

I fear happens vaccine trials fail. Especially ""so far good"" pushed heavily. Wow. world fucked. read posted think I'm russian bot. believe anything online? guess agrees gives kind reassurance okay? live texas. Right middle Houston Galveston. wife nurse. Yall getting fed bullshit. Eat want cant stop yall. Fear everything. Never leave home. die. Good luck useful idiot's. God bless yall. People realize yet bankrupt many large life insurance companies. 

Life insurance companies typically hold lots commercial real estate make money premiums pay death benefits years later. 

I wonder big big insurance companies longer going able pay death benefits. big shock. take since Feb due high risk household. Miss it. Sad Darwinism works reverse. stupid lethal. live Brooklyn 90% people see street neighborhood wearing masks. stores it‚Äôs almost 100%. Even weekend it‚Äôs fairly ok. outdoor spaces get little crowded comfort, nothing makes think shit go downhill fast. It‚Äôs almost month we‚Äôve maintained good numbers. 

I speak neighborhood though. graduate student works lab also got infected back June. Even though everything right, wearing mask making sure distance even outside, sometimes enough. fortunate enough mild case, man wasn't. 15 minute rule!!  Dave exposed. But, who? family member? close friend? god knows.  'karma humans'. seems people interfered nature much, without necessary safety measures place. plenty people love respect nature animals.

And, catch virus, meant be. could bad decision made pure bad luck, e.g. shop wrong time near infected person (that's meant be; that's circumstance) , could someone else's lack care. example, England weekend gone, near live, someone showing symptoms waiting test results idiot decided go several pubs night out. expect, infected several people pubs went forced close. 

In event follow guidelines, particularly social distancing, limit places go to, aye get unlucky catch time certainly reducing risk picking passing someone else. student issues, especially home limited interaction Perhaps 16-0 season, think Cam major upgrade 2019 Brady. Lots reasons think defense could brought postseason games away possible Super Bowl appearance. Maybe. Maybe not. Jets Dolphins rebuilding Buffalo eternally cursed. Colts recently AFC East crown Bills. 

Doesn‚Äôt really matter since would rather anyone die chase potential ring. Bad enough player, even worse families challenges. game, even exciting game. need hate us don‚Äôt want guys die Covid. True. understood distinction article referring SD actual physical distancing decreased frequency contacts (going public less), additional suggestion also decreasing quantity contacts (making circle basically household). know masks help. indoor spaces need ventilated disperse airborne virus particles.

I'd rather laid dead, old heart disease issues. single American suffered consequences due pandemic, think.

Option 3 besides vaccine lockdowns federal government would manufacture shitton PPE, aggressive contact tracing, guarantee food housing sick person ever forced go work. NYC example, hairdressers allowed work wear full set PPE gear similar surgeon wears. 

There tons ways government failing protect us economically medically lockdowns one I'm mad about. federal government aggressive containing virus february march never would gotten point  first thought. spent time around bikers teen partied plenty bikers early 20s (Late mid 30s now), lot mid 40s up. Even back would considered high risk health issues. imagine amount risk now. RIP guys. Well said! feel many people getting hopes vaccine may well never happen, thinking verified approved next year fantasy. large amounts people, many significant behavioral issues, together once.

there bidet models replace installed seat, mechanical, need electricity. Lmao That‚Äôs wondering. hear ways. virus needs somewhere go spread. Isolate virus virus dies.

Pretty fucking simple really. Wear mask stay fuck away people gone.

Should draw ya fucking pictures??? problem parents elementary school aged children remote learning solution. parents lucky enough work home, still can't *actually* work rangling young children. Someone posted FB wishing father happy 81st birthday. packed restaurant. Indoors. People take seriously sooner later. Sadly going take another 150k deaths get people realize going away.

Hell, I'm getting divorced right now, I'm lot stress, I'm stealing businesses shooting people, wear mask whenever leave apartment. 20 people plane, everyone wearing mask. different inside store ? air constantly filtered read. Plus got tested negative fly Europe 72h before. fucking idiots. mean really reason? CNN opinion piece prove point? Lol seriously! CNN? arrested. animals wearing mask New Jersey native, living Florida...just let sink lol  That‚Äôs happens curve peaks available medical services capacity. know, like experts saying entire time.

I get people learned government large lying them; it‚Äôs bad medical science got caught blowback. timing couldn‚Äôt worse. 

Hang everyone. telling is. force people wear masks royally pissed. consequences. Honestly, wearing mask odds getting exposed better don‚Äôt make physical contact them. shut business breaks law? once, chances they'll again. really want infected people going work they're afraid they'll get fired stay home?  know we're them, information CDC: them, looks like basically world *was* constant measles outbreak? like chickenpox used guess, everyone got point either became immune died? know either. suggest reading page.

It's frankly staggering childhood mortality used be. antibiotics, kids would die strep throat. Think times got strep throat kid. rampant schools. certain percentage classmates used literally die. consequence public schooling - death ""Scarlet Fever"" (which progression severe strep). 

Like covid, measles absolutely horrible things body -- often doesn't. really gamble want take. consequences lose dire. 

Measles also interesting actually wipe existing immunities. process responding measles, body basically overwrite cells using store information antibodies. example, got chickenpox measles, could get chickenpox body longer remembers defend chickenpox. aint called Frankghanistan nothing. Thank reassurance, genuinely appreciated! Words hard sometimes. thought googled quote turns major news organizations taking context. talking Governor Connecticut Connecticut much better rest country. going partying every weekend fraction compared many causes death US

I think backwards chief. Many causes death fraction COVID-19. third leading cause death country accidents around 170,000 deaths/year. There's basically way hell end less 12,000 deaths final 5 months year means looking two causes death higher, heart disease cancer. take years develop kill too, days weeks like COVID-19. ""Cancer"" also forms, specific one. COVID-19's already killed people leading cause cancer deaths lung cancer around 140,000 deaths/year. 80 years old. cheese tray, serve anything looks good dark background it! Bread, fruit, various hors d'oeuvres, etc. Mondays always really low death count whatever reason. Last Monday 428 Tuesday get stale. Texas less 10k deaths. odds knowing someone died really low State 29 million. think first responders suited best PPE money buy still get it. regular people, mask provides lot protection guarantee especially people around taking serious. Thank much! think that's pretty common among many large fandoms.

Look Star Wars - got prequel haters, sequel haters, more. There's ton vitriol spewed back forth among different camps, directed toward Disney/Lucasfilm execs, movie screenwriters/directors, actors, etc. get really toxic (there's common saying: ""Nobody hates Star Wars like Star Wars fans""). Reaction caused creation ""positive"" communities/subreddits negativity tolerated. Sounds great surface, realize can't meaningful discussion moment say ""I care much part, interesting they'd done thing instead,"" get blasted praising absolutely perfect without flaw.

Hell, one favorite bands switched drummers decade ago, there's pretty big divide better.

Ultimately think feeds humans' innate tendency toward tribalism. pick side, dig heels, fight guys death rather coming amicable agreement understanding. Challenging preconceived ideas new information introspection mentally taxing fighting. see sports entertainment, political parties, course even global pandemic. subreddit well ideologically opposed subreddits, I've seen comments adding plain facts without slant opinion, downvoted oblivion facts support prevailing ideology. humans can't help themselves. :(

... controlled pay gap differs race too. data controlled, largest gap earnings black African American women white men. Black women make $0.97 every dollar white man qualifications makes. controlled gender pay gap Hispanic white women less $0.98 every dollar white man credentials earns, also 2019. However, Asian women make $1.02 every $1 dollar white man makes. Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander women make $0.99...
 
My comments:. varies profession, overall, controlled number hours worked, years experience, education, similar factors, pay gap averages somewhere 97 102 percent. personally find single percentage points significant enough worry about.
 
And Google - hired outside firm audit employees pay make sure fair across gender. ended giving men raises paid.
 large, women paid less work less, less experience and/or education, get retention raises often they're less likely shop around better paying job. Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam et al shown us anything masks distancing work initial viral load may much ensure lower mortality rate.

This headline makes think school's opened 260 employees sudden got covid, true story. I've noticed cases started increasing since opened borders. wondering there's relation all?

Also, whole party Aarhus couple weeks ago, think better job preventing bad situation today.

I feel like opened gyms v√¶rtshuse up, cases really go much.

Overall think Denmark good job, I've noticed people starting care less, social distancing, traveling outside country, etc. think social responsibility wear masks. suspect they're perfect, seem significantly reduce transmission. 

I view wearing mask way view saying hands using bathroom: illegal, don't, think gross, irresponsible jerk.  people still stock piling toilet paper?

I tired trying reason fuckwits. Yeah Ecuador passed China actual cases long time ago, testing capacity underwhelming. Precisely Case-fatality rate
The case-fatality rate proportion persons **with particular condition (cases) die condition.** measure severity condition. formula is:

Number cause-specific deaths among incident cases divided Total number incident cases√ó 10 n
The case-fatality rate proportion, numerator restricted deaths among people included denominator. time periods numerator denominator need same; denominator could cases HIV/AIDS diagnosed calendar year 1990, numerator, deaths among diagnosed HIV 1990, could 1990 present.

EXAMPLE: Calculating Case-Fatality Rates
In epidemic hepatitis traced green onions restaurant, 555 cases identified. Three case-patients died result infections. Calculate case-fatality rate.

Case fatality rate = (3 ‚ÅÑ 555) √ó 100 = 0.5% don‚Äôt understand math. We'll disagree here. Acting like asshole makes asshole regardless perceived nobility cause. true. US facing massive teacher shortage! 3.7 million teachers us 1/4 high risk. propose replace little 1 million teachers schools starts fall? You‚Äôre living different reality. government get handle virus stop playing popularity/ corporate ass kissing games. reports ever going measure cases active total? 

There 2.5 million recoveries US. Surely could include still hospitalized lingering effects active. we‚Äôve seen worse plagues. You‚Äôre talking general population case I‚Äôve talking school aged children. case Covid‚Äôs spread mortality vastly different look subset. agree risks can‚Äôt eliminated, choose live many. I‚Äôm saying COVID, old worst co-morbidities, completely acceptable risk. Also note: COVID doesn‚Äôt kill generally doesn‚Äôt leave neurological damage busted lungs. countries longer lockdown seeing come back strong (France, spain, UK) irony bigotry pretty incredible, must say. Even 1% high. worried kids education put hold maximum 1 year actual lives livelihoods.

Just come say truth; give fuck people's lives.  going stop them? It‚Äôs BS pretty much maintain status quo NoLa. 

Got it. Abort jesus Anyone understands happening socially, politically epidemiologically realized months ago. question decide ""new normal"" without dismantling much constituted normaln person entity trustworthy change? People die continue die, looking like leading cause death. Therefore, many die, concern. Drug abuse, cancer heart disease gone away. Assholes. exposed grandma. 88. Yes absolutely agree you. trying provide info without injecting analysis :) overweight, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt look much different many kids. harsh reality 20% children obese (according CDC). Whether comorbidity exists comfort me. summarizing article. Statistics apparently understand. Also, let's ignore fact white house cooking numbers since they've insisted taking control data sending public. 

If want keep track actual undoctored statistics [then go COVID Tracking Lol joking right? know US also suffering another pandemic.

*But comparing recent totals deaths causes provide complete picture pandemic‚Äôs impact tracking deaths people confirmed diagnoses. Epidemiologists refer fatalities gap observed normal numbers deaths ‚Äúexcess deaths.‚Äù*


*Through July 18, estimated excess deaths 36 percent higher official coronavirus fatality count. pattern holds rest country, would put current death toll 204,000 people.
Many epidemiologists believe measuring excess deaths is¬†[the best assess impact virus real time. shows virus altering normal patterns mortality. high numbers coronavirus pandemic period undermine arguments virus merely killing vulnerable people would died anyway.* Lol. literally generational, century pandemic, okay. 

If schools essential transformative, funded way? Got us far. 

And that? aircraft carriers per capita else? Oh lord  Brazil forgotten led right wing mad men US ever know. elected Bolsonaro closest could get bringing back military dictatorship. insulting say country never thought electing shitty leader saw US it.
 
Also worth remembering half world US always 'the bad apple'. Ask indigenous person world Maine Tonga feel like US government historically good actors. Guns, diddling, usual thought. lady sucks, people need responsibility live TN. county ‚Äúphase 2.‚Äù work restaurant open dine in. seat every table half time people come owner disregards guidelines. supposed seat parties 10 people, party 18 day. 

But hey, lot stores put signs masks required. people care. Also regular old bleach short supply, Lysol wipes are. spray bleach surface wipe cloth paper towel.  Pre-COVID could understand this. assumed person mask probably immunocompromised taking extra precautionary measures. COVID - different story. Ecuador done China curb virus?'

I follow Ecuador currently clarify early obviously Ecuador not. government issued lockdown orders Guayas many people simply comply. want victim blame many simply couldn't. want to. People make money eat Ecuador ¬©ommie Community Committes come lock apartment week's worth sprouted potatoes moldy turnups.

Hope version passes censors great news! Thank sharing. link discussing yet? best (and expected) case scenario. It'd great replicated ofc. 

Very true rest say. Muh rights brainwash muh kids idea missing year person school destroys future anyone absurd.  entitled, lacking empathy, selfish American way life.

Honestly time Americans really untied first start war.  Great, US last line then. clarification, expect accept. Maybe got lost translation. Germany's ""state agency risk assessment"", together largest veterinary agency ""Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"", tested pigs, found susceptibility. officially published yet.

Also, look meat factory videos online. Workers stand crowded.
That standard situation types food processing, least much automation used.

But recently, example, huge outbreaks Bavaria, farm seasonal workers, nearby plant produce packaged. sucks. happening? Like White House getting away this? exactly two vaccines currently US phase 3 trials. Moderna started 6 days ago. six worldwide unfortunate get used way. Also anti-MeToo people. really major damage. Well there's lot sex bible camps hope America. know surprised (especially watching hilarious AXIOS HBO interview), damn. may currently live ""red zone"" mean could quickly turn one start sending kids school. takes one infected person *PoOF* got stuck Redzone month later...We continue experience damaging effects handful people brought pandemic shores. takes one person/child + Irresponsible adults/parents make go downhill real fast.  Leaders good people elect them, people choose listen *mr. disinfectant throat uv lights ass* instead top infectious disease expert, it‚Äôs fault shred critical thinking. 

People already know long time now, keep refusing political bullshit. people‚Äôs fault, starts elected morons fucking everything right now, continues standing fucking things even further. mean, I‚Äôd staying home wearing mask even every single politician ever supported said shouldn‚Äôt so. 

Of course it‚Äôs catastrophic terrible response leaders, Karens Kens know doing, would certainly much better place right wouldn‚Äôt locked much long period time. Damn, coffin dance really taking over. Apt theme song 2020 Lol bro...  Someone gets flu passes 1.3 people average. Covid's reproduction rate somewhere 2 6, depending many asymptomatic people (which entirely know yet). flu also much, much lower mortality rate - kills 2 people per 100,000 per year, compared 45 covid-19 (so far... year ain't yet). think root, problem straw-man assumption everyone thinks wrong wants _eliminate_ risk. one said doubt anyone thinks that's possible. covid-19 bit virulent way, way deadlier flu. Also worth noting: flu kill you, generally leave neurological damage busted lungs. really want argue reason covid became established US current administration incompetent? 

Yes, unequivocally. country's handling unmitigated disaster Day One. 

Thank asking. 

Have nice day. Peace. even manly though? can't ""this reasonable thing human do""? I'm criticizing particular saying this, wonder certain positive characteristics gendered person enough right thing. not, talking Mortality rate, different.

Case fatality rate, also called case fatality risk case fatality ratio, epidemiology, proportion people die specified disease **among individuals diagnosed disease** certain period time. doomed, friend. Yeah agree, ones front lines, I‚Äôm saying besides risk exposed many people, may protecting public eye. I‚Äôm sure test positive home quarantine, right? everything absolutes? 

My point providing anecdotes merely counter blanket statements. Statements made teens education one, something believe strongly insult falling line.

Insulting apparently experience teen directly contradicts POV. fact real world experience, wherein teen actually thrived high school _for first time_, makes naive worthy insinuations. that's goal ultimate objective dismantling public school system. Yeah... spelled pretty well already. response, there's really point trying convince otherwise. agents Nurgle. ""Fuck you, tell me"" - Rage Machine probably [Sweden isn‚Äôt better.] data previous pandemics. Harder shutdowns better long term normality return outbreaks end. Mask usage pretty good apartment, tolerating non-compliance public areas aside pool, never get close to. Grocery store compliance pretty good well experience.

I'm 22 years old, felt bad enough take painkillers yet. pulse oximeter, look getting one. school district told us don‚Äôt respond, don‚Äôt get start day one best give priority people current life death situation. else would do? Like generational catastrophe losing 154,000 people

FTFY Plandemic literally name one batshit conspiracy YouTube videos. Breakfast Line Guy ain't clever, he's watching dumb dumb news.  lot kids wait parents go bed sneak out. Oook. get mean now. 

-Cancer kill. past. future. 

-This virus mutate. past. future.

*This virus absolutely mutated. continue to. likelihood becoming extremely deadly low.  non zero.  that's good news. mean Greenfield last week, no. go lockdown. kept going. tracing, quarantined students, business usual.  would surprised asymptomatic students walking halls.

(Btw, friends 2 teachers there) white black violence, black white violence. BLM worried black black crime police. ............oh wow ,154,000 COVID deaths later, thanks joining us. agree. people know kids celebrating daycares reopening get time themselves. bite tongue around people really want call say think selfish shortsighted way approaching threat virus. parents know victim complex parents. complain lot seen willing make big sacrifices. I'm position judge them, know observations either want kids, want successful life kids (fit, lots savings stable career, right partner), ever all. huge responsibility, really need bring best self table right students dying, school staff teachers well families. really believe rent free? Grow up.

I never suggested be. 

Thanks ad hominem though, guess. Oh actually know what's going I'm high right now. chose random post said person lovely. Well, considering prisoners released ASAP COVID, bet he'll stay long time prison. US apologize Spanish Flu. wrongs committed history. Apologize Iraq, apologize attacking completely wrong party. Apologize authorarian regimes hypocritally established oppress people sake profit power. that's never happened it? sort thing ever happen. think delusional hear ya - haven‚Äôt public park months. can‚Äôt even let kids ride bikes around cul-de-sac neighbors (and kids) don‚Äôt respect social distancing wear masks. drive empty parking lot asthmatic 5YO ride bike 30 minutes without worrying punk ass kid coughing face ‚Äòjoke‚Äô. saw comment governor's Facebook page someone saying right sick healthy wanted to. Yeah, US good :( take 3 years make billion

8.6 months, 3 years, ramping new vaccines instead waiting final approvals, dispose ineffective vaccines Stay classy Hunter getting ship right now??? (locals) fucking angry scared. 4th July every single day months *pandemic.* TIL thing called dole whip. Somehow missed half dozen visits Disney parks. get things back normal. can't believe I'm still reading headline august... meanwhile friends China back business usual.. Players opt still get money. 


I‚Äôm fan canceling season but, end, it‚Äôs prob smartest choice. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* care first.

Answer question.

Was system instituted days weeks?

You seem imply days weeks, I'd like hear evidence.

WA officials say mid-April late begin transition. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* ""How Pandemic Defeated America"" translation MSM bullshitese: America defeated true test proclaimed exceptionalism came Oh no, good combination. Dont worry,  flat plenty states whose Governors insist locking vaccine widely distributed. 

Not every city, state country same. woman stain society. would slap first defend actions later. Wtf wrong people. Wasn‚Äôt recent outbreak bar twin cities? Nope. Won‚Äôt change mind agree. skip beginning article make point saying millions US money savings account? ‚ÄúThe people Mississippi value right die, take everyone around too.‚Äù can.  mother 10 whole kids? That‚Äôs many damn kids Masks work.

If folks go shopping booze masks social distancing, vote masks social distancing.  powerful rich people become camp scout leaders raise good points. üëç I‚Äôm sorry 

*BOISE, Idaho ‚Äî infancy COVID-19 pandemic, research suggested virus infected adults children. also suggested younger child, less chance contracting spreading illness.*

*However, two different studies two different parts world released last week, suggesting children may twice efficient spreading COVID-19 adults.* don‚Äôt think get math works. widely available effective vaccine US year, maybe March say ‚Äújust don‚Äôt see family?‚Äù said ways without huge family get together. high levels infection now, it‚Äôs risky unless social distancing masks measures used minimize transmission. one saying live alone don‚Äôt see anyone. 

We know large family gatherings sources infection spread. can't imagine anyone stupid. Welcome capitalism. say personally i'd estimate given many powerful rich people tend prefer girls younger side. would help read whole thing.

Release without arrest bond seems part read. That‚Äôs vast majority US cases well. covers things like parking tickets traffic violations small offenses. plead guilty pay fine agree show court defend without bond. part you‚Äôre looking scroll little read Canada serious crimes like assault released forfeit money property that‚Äôll returned show court. Sometimes they‚Äôll want someone else (or multiple someone‚Äôs) show also vouch you‚Äôll come back. exactly bond works US.

If keep reading you‚Äôll see serious crimes flight risks, you‚Äôll denied release entirely.

Now maybe differences it‚Äôs applied. linked article doesn‚Äôt describe any. It‚Äôs high level. I‚Äôm liberal Northwest softy think perp deserves assault charge damn, little sense self preservation. go Pier 1 know assholes like everywhere? one encounters once. matter patient was, slowly simply explained it, one lady could comprehend could give refund item left home.

What makes sure millions disenfranchised? anecdote?

My absentee ballot counted 2004 anecdote, expect take word it, provided sources. Ah dammit Nevada, tighten up. country fucked. Still fucking hot though. always go November January. California's high speed rail finally completed. fact going prison question kinda demonstrates huge problem country. COVID much reduced everything vaccine-wise works out. COVID still like winter flu around (which worst case scenario) going one hardest winters ever really want sexist leave stats women. said, fell head. Sally I, saw things fall ‚ÄúYes, Sweden, said. Theyve reached herd immunity broadly speaking dont worry anymore.‚Äù - You

What misunderstand you‚Äôre trying argue? You‚Äôre right aspect. think theaters important terms festivals independent film, don‚Äôt generate Disney revenue. They're three three grifters. They're intentionally presenting circus world draw eyeballs attention, make eventual cash-in lucrative. Book, movie rights, knows. True.

I'm lauging hear 'We're gonna vaccinating population years come' 'we'll dealing years'

No, soon vaccine shown effective, developed countries gonna race vaccinate populations get economy going again. 

COVID likely going problem years come DEVELOPING countries, like diseases.

 
nobody give shit though west we're awful human beings. 

China India 3 billion people combined 7 billion planet. vaccine supplies. 1 billion USA/Europe also supply. Yikes necessary? like 100-200 cases day. Also article saying third wave laughable (even saying second stretch: think first time much five people die week) read headline thinking increasing growth, economic.

Doesn't seem great leads people using public transportation pandemic. honestly don‚Äôt like pineapple stuff, devotee dole whip.  allowing people vote mail telling choose safety duty citizens. That's called voter suppression. Doctor Who? certain less infection rate? mean kids often asymptomatic I'm assuming test invasive (someone said felt like tickled brain), lot covid positive parents might assume kids tested. Basketball still possibility think football sit year may causal relationship wrong way around. People losing faculties prescribed medication. labor test like Mad, contact trace like Mad.

Also corona everybody stopped using cash started using chinese venmo. saw like video guy contact trace tells lady send screenshots venmo goes every store get everyone came within certain Distance her. 

Also 50% wearing masks.

And average chinese city like 10 cases? population wearing masks basically everywhere America besides NYC May fruitful multiply anti bodies Hmm, perhaps Judge adds something like ""you get electric shock every hour 8 hours day"" people bid one give shock. Person bids gets press button, ~20 minute window never exactly sure it'll happen.

Cruel unusual? Maybe, but, I'd take going jail myself. second Come now, surely Walmart turn people away wearing mask, polling places same?

I telling yes, based upon state's voting officials saying: reference link posted earlier.

If total lockdown booze, pot, hardware, bookstores open masks social distancing, vote like normal.

If large crowds still tolerated, airline travel allowed, reason vote normal. Isn‚Äôt Oxford one previous work area? Like years development gone already ? quantitative prediction, I‚Äôm going really really bad French needed another excuse act superior Americans. took 9 months make billion many aspects. Wut? 

Large groups cases could contributing factor number cases? Color shocked. Woo-hoo class 2020 Club.

I'm curious percent men take children doctors visits, especially infants. surprised single digits. wish discussion topics like don‚Äôt necessarily linked article (half bullshit reposts anyway) Yeah, know.  We‚Äôve downward slope Texas, hope continues happening. vaccine works safely. made 1.4 billion vaccine doses 2019 alone, doubling would push. Ummm wealthy parents everywhere... Hey Florida stand ground state right? Could legally put Debby down? slow cases coming 1837-1901 lol wind God person? amazing still tell, despite testing beyond saturated apparently somehow testing reporting becoming complicated. lockdown, functioning contact tracing system, ready made capacity isolate much larger outbreaks they're getting, far, far less 1% total population getting infected?

Sounds good me, things considered.

Remind 6 months. Lol urban legend hits local news comment section atleast day one ever sources asked much complicated one individual. foreign power(s) behind hysteria going on. lady nobody would taken seriously \~5 years ago. Fast-forward now, like reality become one long episode Alex Jones show. Every day. Every single day whole new thing talking almost always waste time. critical issues stay back burning people become fatigued. Meanwhile trap door swinging beneath feet. 

We [entertained, confused, Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, even Reddit times used pump incredibly high volumes misinformation propaganda. war information ages looks like. sophisticated, effective incredibly hard counter. 

My hypothesis? [Jade Helm exposed weakness. 2016 warm up. 2020 real deal. feel you! I've N95+ since February plan changing I'm vaccinated. I've EXTREMLY close calls work managed stay COVID free now.

Alright, hereby replace ""my air"" ""the air Depends aisle Walmart run comes freedom emit CO2 air

Um, that's normal part living. presence coronavirus makes things abnormal, that's intelligent people opt wear mask. really feel like masks, go ahead hop one cruise ships becoming outbreak zones. I'm sure perfectly safe.  We've moved zinc. lack ground unicorn horn administered makes hydroxychloroquine work. got unicorn horn tiny pixies inside hydroxychloroquine nothing eat starve fixing you. TIL kind thing, looked scarlet fever reading comment learned scarlet fever still around (and actually quite common live school year), antibiotics life death issue, often talked much. kids idea still exists blew mind...I remember reading Jane Austen books era thinking glad eliminated scarlet fever XD truly feel frustrating. mean, really?

Teaching completely empty classroom department standardize ensure connection ""dangerous"" all.

It's pretty easy accomplish social distancing completely empty classroom.

I live Bay Area - teachers likely space going office staying home (a teacher's salary afford one home without rommates anywhere near SJ)

It's *more work* teachers know actually risk social distancing guidelines practiced. children all.

I also think ensure teachers dont' move faaaar away district find unable return easily over. Good luck finding ammo tho. No, get it. instead ignorant, stubborn ignorant- true risk America. virtue signal 

you realize use term signal right? hypocrisy baked right in. Trying understand point view today asked bill gates‚Äô motivation inventing covid killing 150k people responded power. told makes absolutely sense bill gates nothing gain called sheep told research. Sigh. blanks kill people. think analogy works. ""You can't force people interested in. Let kill others!"" right line 2020 america Duck roast üëπ online, fucking world wide health crisis, chatting absolute shite!

Nobody, one person believes bull positive tests. Another? already one? .. was.. even know lock down... emigration want fucking ride want President doesn‚Äôt want need ‚Äúfaith advisor‚Äù  well, beach... x'D Savage Burn! said decisions governments took pandemic education would lasting impacts hundreds millions development prospects countries decades come.

As part ""better education"" platform.  Fine me. 
Clickbaity title, that's expected. Ugh, really need cleaning (visible plaque buildup teeth), since pandemic, I've freaking catching something dental office.

This sucks. worship country.

No, not. called respectful wealthy white isn‚Äôt moral offense. racist classist still people regardless popular opinion. Man U.S obviously covering cases hilarious. Like really, take reporting CDC sudden cases thirty thousand like week two? fucking way. Deaths surely higher reported, too. Could high 250,000 I've seen. Still 45-65 minute waits California police enforce it. tell put one first, one get ticket. excuse keep addict ech? think issue Spring increasing testing lot people (relatively speaking) virus increased testing capturing lot cases previously going missed. New York dip 10% positively rate April 4th (a full month first started testing) almost 40% reported US cases point. amount testing capacity March 4th April 4th, we'd likely seen lot confirmed cases steeper decline US numbers time frame due hard hit. Repeat rest Northeast it'd probably even apparent hit definite plateau came significantly. would worried good catching things is.  I'd tell right hit head hammer probably would hailed defender freedom something imagine shop couldn‚Äôt see happening, you‚Äôd think someone one hell cough *cough, cough, bang* good friend spent march June leaving apartment even went far judging going supermarket instead getting groceries delivered. (We're nyc.) Anyway, vacation carribbean right now... Continuous shows respect groups function stay cohesive. idea virtue signaling, useful accurate degree, ultimately toxic idea. Indeed idea created specifically counter people exploiting group cohesion empty cynical gestures designed draw attention themselves. value like chemotherapy it‚Äôs poisonous distilled limited manor possible.

Basically standard person showing respect deference disruptive drawing attention away something important, maybe call out, calling makes toxic one. At, cult 45 implying cult 45th president? Thanks explanation. also quit. Actual question: allowed punch someone you? gotta get that. Good times What's plan two weeks students back school? Send 30+ students (or possibly 100 middle/high school) teacher interacted testing quarantine? think Karen meme intended punish women speaking up.

It's simple. Women speak bitches, men speak ambitious/go-getters/keeping real Even weren‚Äôt pandemic, coughing cancer patient serious dick move think plan go back work try die company time. industry currently working wait people die, go take jobs. Pretty sure that's plan got next months. Worse, driving 600 miles without knowing store open, middle riot, getting angry store others broken looted it. what? filters filter air? known millennia.

However, direct proof face masks reduce transmission SARS-CoV-2, would require randomized clinical trial would unethical conduct. I've traveled. Hotels fine, stay away people. Drive flying. Relevant username relevant know what‚Äôs really sad? school sent email today saying admission football games free students. can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre still pushing football season let alone trying encourage students go. Texas, way. Houston, Texas. guess sweet, sweet football dollars important lives wellbeing students. Welcome working class. Interesting. People wear masks fear looked upon something wrong stupid. 
Ad guess make reality can, instead, tell wrong.

My take. Good thing that's said. :) don‚Äôt watch NBC CNN day, anxiety may go away disgusting parts human, don‚Äôt call ‚Äúdisgusting humanity.‚Äù years kids would go year year without getting seasonal flu. soon school age kids...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wasn‚Äôt talking Disney open now, course shouldn‚Äôt be. saying doesn‚Äôt make sense hate someone love. agree, except choose two. ridiculous sad. Yep Let great Darwinian experiment commence. see copy anywhere? need start locking people up. one thing noticed, one rarely see ""situations"" outside us (reported/recorded). coughing people means assault.

only states.

In way Covid19 us like driving/parking sidewalk russia (people watched Stop douchebag yt know mean).

The entitlement people boggles mind. Yup.. Meanwhile Melbourne, AU going [Stage lockdown 6 weeks try nip spread.

Perhaps USA contains outbreak stops exporting it.. US citizens basically banned entering country.. thing slow down.

America really needs think global impact... especially lasting impression world us responsible spreading much virus... Like 1918 Kansas flu. Thankfully, us, history rewrote one ""spanish flu"". I'm worried number antivaxxers disguise roaming thread YIKES  You. like style. USA fall/winter = BIBLICAL

They looking back even thousand years (If make long). obviously read article Yeah you. first world countries lock right rhe first time begining recover nicely.  America, hand, thought could ignore COVID, need longer painful lockdown get control. bad morons bothered wear mask go bar months ruin everyone else. really stop making decisions may affect anyone else future. Live West Village. nice around you. Also, rats. 80 year old would alive today virus control. fuck wrong people? people less afraid. know they're pretending? don‚Äôt understand people watch football good conscience. literally kills. that's is.

That rational well behaved population gets manageable situation. don‚Äôt live Texas extended family grew there. don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs died it. Neither they. certainly know people who‚Äôve it, one died. They‚Äôve also careful beginning - - people know. it‚Äôs annoying Texas get painted broadlh Testing extremely hard requires lot man power, test kits testing facility. Karma might find them, covid sure fuck will, think got worry least. RIP poor fucker. say new cases declining since National Guard taken reporting job CDC. No, say it. Sounds like he‚Äôs talking Like prolonged tb? gotten better treating Covid, geographically wider spread somewhat lowered strain healthcare systems per case previously vastly increased testing. lowers percentage confirmed positive cases result death, total amount confirmed positive cases vastly increased total death numbers, rate increase doubling last month.

In opinion daily death count probably better metric see we're doing, time passes 500-1500 deaths added make smaller portion total deaths, day day little progress made. sure , others wrong , agree trump deserves executed ? Except can't ignored. public endangers everyone else.

We 'competent' countries share stubborn folks. also govts authoritarian enough enforce mandatory mask usage.

The countries use law either mask culture begin like Japan, hit badly SARS last time need little encouragement wear masks like Hong Kong. shot store clerk police shot , organised medical flight get hospital.

No knee neck ? * Inaccurate testing (Florida due Hurricane + Texas reported last 2 days)
* Numbers lower weekends
* Downtick daily tests

But we're seeing less new positives per day last week seen rise deaths last 4 weeks, probably continue go throughout August. Rat stick? Everyone works living proletariat Yikes. allowed without mask, nobody allowed sit either! serve take-out only. wish friends right now

Well there's easy solution dick this, he's cool dude.

Just lol. everyone insincere words.

Maybe anxiety? Brace frugal, kinda guy (or gal) US straight sucks comes supporting families many fronts. embarrassing, really. I'm happy people countries deal wish could get together take care better. You‚Äôre God‚Äôs work adamant group insists upon stats able distinguish direct COVID deaths indirect COVID deaths. excess mortality available, they'll dismiss data.

I agree them, see sound reasons would want this. able distinguish two gives insight tradeoffs various responses (lockdown vs open) allows us make ""apples apples"" comparisons past pandemics, usually report direct/confirmed cases.

The reason agree think rationale moot point. Undertakers across country looking pickup sheets noting substantial increase suicides, cancer deaths, COVID-asymptomatic heart attacks strokes. That's what's keeping busy. COVID is.

And make ""apples apples"" comparisons, I'd say once-in-a-lifetime pandemic pretty much makes impossible. data-collecting infrastructure public health/medical knowledge past pandemics. Every turn-of-the-century pandemic going different methodological basis, ""apples apples"" impossible. comparing numbers past pandemics current one anyway? Yes, 1918 far horrible, using fact justify taking pandemic seriously like okay wildfire burned ""only"" 100,000 acres ones previous years burned millions. Yeah turns living like 90 million costs lot money. 

Expenditure always rises meet income. It‚Äôs joke horrible mistranslation article. read two different agency names word salad posted? Fuck people. Sorry mom... dare deny experiences. think are?  looking go? I‚Äôve casually researching. Haven‚Äôt found anything worth uprooting family living immigrant. Apparently Fauci (and has) terrible people. terrible, aggressive, unhappy rude people. 

a breath positivity - saying (rather rude one, rough translation serbian - along original fun it): ""10 people cannot clean sh\*t one guy made"" / ""sto jedan zasere, deset ne moze da opere"" 

so ... kinda, one bad person least hundred nice. 

also, downside: world 100 let moron behave like that? Taking mask talk completely stupid masks definitely make harder understand other. Wtf bond low assault urgency understood; problem logistics.

The US can't even get testing anyone swab...vaccines, contrast, require trained professionals. Thank putting trash black, would killed police spot. (Monday, August 3, 2020 23:08)

Relief, NeuroRx Say Emergency Treatment RLF-100 Helps Critically Ill Covid Patients - New York Times
www.nytimes.com


TEL AVIV ‚Äî Critically ill COVID-19 patients recovered rapidly respiratory failure three days treatment RLF-100, therapy granted fast-track designation United States, two drug companies said Sunday.

Geneva-based Relief Therapeutics Holdings AG patent RLF-100, aviptadil, synthetic form natural peptide protects lung. U.S.-Israeli NeuroRx Inc partnered Relief develop drug United States.

In June U.S. Food Drug Administration granted fast-track designation RLF-100 treatment respiratory distress COVID-19.

While Phase 2/3 clinical trial 70 patients ongoing, RLF-100 administered emergency basis patients ill admitted trial.

The first report rapid recovery emergency use posted doctors Houston Methodist Hospital, companies said joint statement.

It said 54-year-old man developed COVID-19 treated rejection double lung transplant came ventilator within four days treatment RLF-100.

Similar results subsequently seen 15

patients treated emergency use, companies said.

The two companies also said independent researchers biocontainment laboratory Brazil reported aviptadil blocked replication SARS coronavirus human lung cells immune cells.

""No antiviral agent demonstrated rapid recovery viral infection demonstrated laboratory inhibition viral replication,"" NeuroRx CEO Jonathan Javitt said.

The clinical trials looking whether similar observations confirmed less ill patients COVID-19-related respiratory failure.

An independent data monitoring committee conducting interim analysis data later month, Javitt told Reuters.

We still hospitals antibiotics doctors around olden days still used needed.  Ignorance kills. thought Odell plays WR? NEED allow people defend cough attacks. 

In city, currently $200 fine wearing mask.

$1652 fine breaching Stay Home orders (up $10k repeat offenders). fine breaching isolation orders second subsequent time testing positive coronavirus $4957 spot, extended Magistrates' Court repeat offenders maximum $20,000.

There absolutely way defend cough attacks, take issue seriously society put actual mandates mask wearing staying home place. wore mask protesting even Rona delete america featured article: data even close even estimating percent infected suffer long lasting damage. 

Anecdotes tiny samples hospitalized patients tells us little vast majority infected people experience (which basically zilch). Love TWiV, best source information right now. 4 million people diagnosed, likely 40-400m infected recovered, completely asymptomatically. yes it‚Äôs like gun victim 80 years old pulled trigger 10 times two successful shots fired. 

But yeah let‚Äôs literally murder anyone coughs, anyone truly believes psycho Deaths lag infections 3 weeks. ""is going get worse left-leaning states start teach left-biased version history perceived need ""correct record"" whatever phrase would be.""

Cops proven rapists, murderers, thieves protected lobbied laws unions. police need pacified held accountable law.

/r/2020PoliceBrutality Sadly retail common. means nothing value lost  sure different lots things people en masse -- hiking popular trails, going beach, walking around cute little downtown areas. Wear mask, keep distance, stay open air. see people sort thing over. Fortunately didn‚Äôt happen. Yea.

July 24th 1150 deaths July 7th (2 weeks earlier) 51k new cases. That's 2% mortality first week July's new cases. logic worst day 75k new reported cases yield 1500 deaths. way hits 11k deaths per week last months documented infections. Wait what, like subs. hear guys COVID-19 made poop 50 dollar bills, would feel economy? parents town seem eager send kids back school state sure school leadership teachers take necessary precautions. 

As teachers, like say put 10 gallons manure 5 gallon bucket. sure teachers best materials given, many bodies classroom space have, given unsolvable problem. pure fantasy.

As school leadership, supposed fingers social distancing needs resources available teachers. know untapped classroom space distributing teachers. untapped classroom space, recognizing problem calling timeout.

I think superintendent visiting school asking teacher show plan arrange desks enforce social distancing. fun it.

They may think funny like makes feel powerful control potentially expose someone virus relatively high chance killing person, biological attack. People compared knowing whether shooting blanks live ammo, like comparison, I'm likely survive getting shot getting Covid. 

There lot us likely survive getting shot getting sick us look anyone else does. even cougher Covid, still pass along illness person coughed on.

This kind attack big deal. someone who‚Äôs cancer twice, that‚Äôs attempted murder Buddy, attacking someone coronavirus gonna get sick. like someone weapon, run away. Basic common sense.

Honestly, gives fuck? what's right. alive go prison, must off-white.

He shot multiple times, survived. makes unjust shootings better, though. countries done exactly this. hard Americans? use ‚Äúcogent‚Äù sentence.... think people wiping purchases, there's really need use part. I've used half pack since started...and that's dad gotten poop bathroom twice, 4 year old missed toilet once. might use one disinfect phone used shopping. guess occasionally use 1-2 spill liquid leftover defrosting chicken counter. see point using much else. female ones? got 3200 go run 7000 months warning time prepare. Yes, thousands died unnecessarily.  exact reason hope get first batch distribution way winter... could either normal winter one hardest times public health ever Yes, lot dumb people well due punto cinque Ohio good deception, corruption, greed, cruelty, selfishness took charge.

Now slow slide hill.

The bioterrorists won. fine ( flames surrounded)...... Nahhh got this, let‚Äôs ramp everyone already it. Can‚Äôt new cases already got  make amazing point. lament United States populace that's really productive use time.

In opinion responses countries translate variety reasons. Blaming Trump he's Xi Jingping efficient rule following populace Angela Merkel seems bit stretch. defending guy, sucks person oval office going run much issues him.

This replied another commenter:
That's fair opinion. opinion, United States 330 million people spread one biggest countries land area planet also one capitalist countries travel business/pleasure ingrained fabric society. 
In opinion, contact tracing much easier Germany, highly organized cohesive society follows rules roughly size Texas though larger population.
I think good comparison United States. That's opinion. look longingly Germany/Vietnam/Australia automatically assume worked would work diversity population, obesity issues, political divisiveness strikes unrealistic.
BTW, great piece Economist actually breaks US stacks European responses US comes ahead.
It's okay completely emotional thinking, recognize such. thought findings Princess Diamond Cruise ship made clear least part transmission aerosols. People confined quarters, yet got sick. How? Via transmission air ducts. pandemic really exposed stupid lot people corporations are. Oh hey look it‚Äôs bullshit again. lying? initial test, test again. got ""better"" considered OK. Bleach rag works well better environment. wait CV19 shorter too. Science fixed immutable thing. proposed yesterday change light new evidence today. Consider seen short time schools reopened, social distancing cases teachers quarantined student came school, later tested positive. 

In light this, Reddit unreasonable suggest bad idea. jump extremes yes, concerns warranted here. admitted child's school shut. Would rather followed prior scientific guidelines rigidly stayed open despite risks? technically take antibody test test positive, covid..so part coronavirus tally right?

All show exposure. can‚Äôt see Washington post article due paywall. 

1. ‚ÄúTo save money remote learning conducted small number BEST teachers nationwide,‚Äù clearly lack understanding education. Lower student teacher ratios classes growth. Teaching isn‚Äôt lesson. There‚Äôs assessment, feedback, rapport relationship building etc. things take time see classroom. long would take online teacher grade papers give constructive feedback? plan teachers would meet needs hundreds hundreds students. Teachers already stretched terms class size. traditional middle school teacher sees anywhere 100-120 students PER day. 

2. ‚ÄúRescue school districts financially‚Äù 
School budgets constantly slashed. causes teacher lay-offs, lack funding materials curriculum. propose cut jobs already struggling system? benefit kids? Schools need funding reopen safely. Online teaching work traditional teaching. People don‚Äôt want get sick risk loved ones. 

Also, position FILLED mean isn‚Äôt teaching Teacher turnover rate substantially high 19%-33% teachers quit within first 5 years. (The higher percentage common low income schools less resources). Constantly long term subs first year teachers negatively impacts student learning. Teaching takes time really good requires lot support! 
Teacher enrollment programs 35% recent years. Less people want job. Teachers expected prop economy still punching bag. 

I suggest read economic report linked goes depth many issues surrounding education. It‚Äôs easier blame group professionals accept politicians defunding education decades negatively impacting kids. Perhaps volunteer classroom see much work goes behind scenes instead throwing entire workforce bus. people staying classroom less less. Even expected stop school shootings still best global pandemic. Maybe try sympathizing them. assure educators would rather back normal right now. shouldn‚Äôt risk families health so. government failure here. good day. Latinos takes confirm? Yes was. even question. Donald Trump still Donald got elected today. think Hilary somehow comparable Donald Trump, know say. Yeah, believe used masks protective visors elder care much sooner did. Especially crowded place like Stockholm. 

&amp;nbsp; 

It's like using disinfectants hands whole body. use hands effective even though body used less likely would viruses survives. think sam face masks. used effective. way get high degree protection still making taxing population be.

I use protective gear daily work home risk getting infected pretty much non-existant comparison low numbers infections live. government historically allowed cable service providers ‚Äúmonopolies scale‚Äù service areas. done conserve facilities. time came about, reasonable concern dubious current technology. It, however, fault governmant things changed. instead problem related entire political environment exist in. Previous de-regulation allowed service providers held accountable made changes hurt customers. So, kept ‚Äúlocal monopoly‚Äù without accountability service previously held. 

Look, worked phone cable service industries around 10 years. Though involved tech side directly, tech support services good idea worked. working phone service, one companies worked encouraged understanding regulatory environment order understand limitations company could provide (service wise). research junky, led long rabbit hole. It‚Äôs true 15 years ago, curiosity kept least superficial regulatory changes since then. Frankly. tell don‚Äôt want less regulation telecom cable industry; *not* get better service choices. 10 years industry 15 years since, less regulation led fewer choices worse service (at least customer service side, around horn). Economic suffering death. would really sacrifice people‚Äôs lives make economy little better? sacrifice bunch teachers, janitors, bus drivers, cooks, parents kids dying kids school? That‚Äôs sad Still way damn high. Wear GDM! I‚Äôll say I‚Äôll disengage. Nobody claiming everyone ‚Äúright‚Äù free sh-t whenever feel like it, especially national health emergency like coronavirus. 

All us, Americans, contributed system we‚Äôre entitled access basic things systems we‚Äôve already agreed contributed civilized society. includes social safety nets ‚Äî it‚Äôs literally exist. 

So yes, it‚Äôs right, definition. 

It‚Äôs civil societies mitigate greater damage things like pandemics, recessions massive job losses. Sorry chafes it‚Äôs ‚Äúcivilizations‚Äù keep collapsing. 

Thank understanding. Throwing money wasteful system going waste money.  need bureaucratic reform educational system money spent educators less bureaucrats. bother point? course not. costs money would force shut down.

So testing better testing guess. Hope best. ^/s

From Disney responded arguing testing isn‚Äôt always reliable. ‚ÄúThe existing COVID-19 testing viable screening tool recommended FDA used way,‚Äù Disney labor relations director Bill Pace wrote statement. ‚ÄúGiven current range false negatives, high 38 percent infectious period COVID-19, testing Cast Members give false sense security.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMany Americans resisted wearing masks social distancing‚Äù

Compared what? 

Compared countries without pre-existing mask-wearing, US relatively high rates mask-wearing throughout pandemic, early now. doesn‚Äôt explain worse. lot countries much lower mask usage rates like Denmark Canada much ‚ÄúAmericans exceptionally... stupid, selfish, etc‚Äù explanation doesn‚Äôt cut me. people without paid sick leave decide getting families kicked street going work sick spreading virus, people make decision didn‚Äôt make choices. uninsured people walking around, even shutdowns. easy choices either.

You know ""would rather""??? would rather virus never existed!!! we're dealing however dealing it. Maybe need take moment relax stop trying trigger everything...

It's love oppress minorities, sexual differences, etc, think 'freedom' means top, mishandling this. They're majority America, they're enough mess things rest you. Asymptomatic cases still damage. going say, guy sociopath. understand people would care someone? Like, dude. Ill go further. think antimaskers deserve pepper-sprayed. here

 Yep. lack critical thinking skills. understand risk reduction mitigation. reason since someone got killed wearing seatbelt, seatbelts work. Honestly comment somehow saddest.

You're agreeing somehow merely paying respects condolences passed virtue signalling.

It's ironic comment right reads like biggest ""virtue signal"" - fucking hate term. 

Your opinions border completely invalidated. Invalidated subject, invalidated inappropriate timing, invalidated self-serving egocentric reasons posting.

Fuck - read room. Even Denmark facing this. article DR Aarhus 22,6 cases per 100k last week. continues week Norway would restrict travels there.

Or least is. bad outbreak need get though? longest quarantines taking place rn? forget strikes!!  Dedicated trolling. 

Nothing like simple, uncreative BS trolls see around here. guy/gal putting work. don‚Äôt seem paying attention. I‚Äôm aware that.

**- entire business community, see improvement, still development corona situation governs, says Fredrik Johansson Tormod, unit manager KI.**

For entire business community, positive trend continues, albeit modest progress, according KI's latest extra survey.

The sectors included ""total business"" manufacturing industry, construction, trade service sector.

\- state look total business community, fewer companies say turnover negatively affected. slowly moving better direction clear improvement, says Fredrik Johansson Tormod.

Compared KI's previous survey, conducted second half June, fewer companies loss turnover compared normal. 60 percent companies state loss turnover all. previous survey, corresponding figure eight percentage points higher.

There also companies feel sales unaffected, compared normal.

\- governs everything right corona situation develops. Sweden's positive trend continues, much suggest development business sector same. corona ruling right now.

KI writes results trade service sectors essentially reminiscent results total business. comes manufacturing industry construction, development positive.

The biggest loss manufacturing industry. 45 percent industrial companies participated survey stated turnover loss 25 percent compared normal. compared previous survey, 30 percent companies stated experienced loss.

Compared previous survey, result principle unchanged regarding estimated risk wind business. 30 per cent companies total business sector answer risk liquidation.

\- see look like autumn following measurements, says Fredrik Johansson Tormod.

The survey conducted July 27-29 KI received significantly fewer responses previous extra measurements. means uncertainty results greater previous publications, KI emphasizes. free all, mate There's evidence suggesting even 'asymptomatic' cases may still develop serious issues heart inflammation perhaps blood clots. less forewarning danger they're front might touched something (a frend family member) absently mindedly touched nose. That's took. Dutch government currently holiday check back weeks. Imagine many Americans kids live instead dying school shootings year. Good Guy COVID probably save children's lives kills. Thank god that, nightmare aye already need Yellow Fever. yellow card. can't travel many countries without Yellow Fever vaccine. Hurting ppl right needlessly insulting ppl. also need understand cause someones anger questioning highest priority list, make less valid. Though place, wrote, anger questioning misguided misplaced important correct instead needlessly throwing mean insults rather explain would wrong. guess thats polarised american way never getting solution. talking friend recently. impression you, find studies back up. you?  think stuff like hospital data (which nightmare right now). Cases reported directly states well test numbers. Hate say perception freedom fuck everyone else I‚Äôm seems core ~~American~~ Humanity,s dream. 

*There fixed u* Sure, small factions. small factions loons likely appear anywhere.

It's like saying someone Wuhan particularly likely Covid Wuhan birthplace. Germany done stamp Nazism anywhere else much way Wuhan eliminated Covid harder anywhere else - suffered worst effects first wave.  obviously particular study media coverage got attention sub too: Think made two opposite points:

1. testing shortage
2. Less people get tested voluntary

If increase #2 worsen #1.

That is, mandatory testing would increase demand tests thereby worsen testing shortage.

Similarly, mandatory vaccines would increase demand vaccine worsen vaccine material labor shortages.

How much would increase material demand? least much testing demand people get vaccinated tested vaccination mandatory.

How much would increase labor demand? least much testing people get vaccinated tested vaccination mandatory.

Therefore, mandatory vaccinations would increase material labor demands compared testing now. agree testing shortage exists, means agree vaccination shortage occur.

If like check logic mathematical proof, quick calculations number hospitals local area, hospital staff able vaccinate (you might need use total workforce even though it'll fraction capable--but give far optimistic number, predict still pencil favor surplus labor), number people need vaccinations area.

How long take everyone area vaccinated? Make sure account traffic, social distancing/spacing, realistic clinic times operation. Garbage in, garbage out. Let's see ages 2 months Asymptomatic cases still spread families so... karma proxy? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article tends case adopted. I'd ask God cast spell could haunt them.

But generally show emotional respect dead. voted many lack respect dead. that‚Äôs another point, may mild case, knows done body. reports asymptomatic people scarred lungs. kids develop Kawasaki disease diagnosed. There‚Äôs Covid living dying it‚Äôs shame deal selfish people. EVER go 1 first place? I‚Äôd rather peace, unless need charge phone reason I‚Äôm dead. Yeah yeah,, know viruses transmitted,, went school.  look Sweden, business usual, forced lockdowns facemask requirements social distancing fared worse nation. fact fared better some.  hospital reference, go environment people sick would wear mask, live hospital. fact one coworkers came covid, 3 others quarantine, told get tested. three us told employer sick refuse get tested would dangerous health step environment may multiple cases. Guess I'm back work test. look sweden.  Holy shit thats bad take dude. sad part anti-maskers use stories ammunition cause. ‚ÄúLook, people wore masks, still got infected. don‚Äôt work.‚Äù majority people intelligent enough understand true value masks preventing others getting infected majority public share consensus use them. point complex cherry-picking Karens. Absolutely heartbreaking. May soul RIP. No. Really? that's state issue. states testing people ever before, testing less, testing same. Still cases asymptomatic, karma given. government anti fascist likes stop small factions. Oh would‚Äôve thrown hands fast ‚Äú information war‚Äù bombs dropped exploded everywhere...

This happens respect knowledge gone window...

People put gas cars ( based fossil fuels , meaning organic carbon based plants life species lived long time ago), don‚Äôt believe evolution planet‚Äôs age..

They use fire heat cook foods , based physics changing carbon bonds..

They get airplane flies tens thousands feet air, yet don‚Äôt believe planet round jet streams air currents..

It‚Äôs soo sad people contradict DAILY, every minute lives.. leaders sown seed ‚Äú fake‚Äù ‚Äú hoax‚Äù rhetoric... social media provides platform spreading theories..it‚Äôs untethered , unchecked, unfiltered means spread false material, gotten us at.. assume 'rioters', mean black person wants treated same, white people thing

Because that's fair cunt

Shit looked history well wtf One major risk commute. Lots people use public transport get work, they're making risk exposure sit empty classroom could home. family member shared office someone TB weeks getting diagnosis get it. actually easy get TB otherwise good health. There's reason HIV TB strongly linked many parts world. Hey I‚Äôve smoked weed daily past 4 years kicked 1-2 days! realize vast majority casualties elderly care? Closing schools business would protected one bit, proper PPE people working elderly care, would saved lives.

The average age people died Covid 82, right around average life expectancy, let sink in. Yeah it‚Äôs also shitty spread misleading titles scare people. quite American hater post history. Maybe time go find new place live since hate much yeah?  spreads much effectively winter people vitamin deficient cooped confined spaces. infection severe disease result. moon  expensive

Interesting. kind masks wearing? Guatemala, within 48 hours mask mandate announced last March streets flooded hand made multilayer cloth masks 65 cents US. long time since we've valued education smart school labeled nerd dork bullied. people never grew that. weird US people look school reopenings gone ok countries there's cases general try apply US. 

I mean, countries open restaurants office buildings too, large spread virus. mean currently US. last post infection got sticking things dick. already know dirty ass degenerate. need go coughing people. cop out. elect play, get paid care yourself. Others care also understand that‚Äôs job. Everything risk. go job everyday risk.  Dead students fair well standardized testing. would ""Jeebus"" do?! 

What can't see kill you, it?! Middle-Ages type thinking?! There's people make living live events. take away livelihoods Trump idiot...therefore lets give total power national strategy. 

Makes sense. can't acknowledge incompetence Whitehouse, imply Whitehouse define national policy. See area got back men‚Äôs shampoo, men‚Äôs 5 1 body wash/shampoo, video game consoles (and sold lest +100 retail price), printers (why why), computers. that‚Äôs stuff I‚Äôve seen.

Regeneron authors options and/or stock company. work described one pending provisional patent applications. N.S, A.J.M., G.D.Y. C.A.K. officers Regeneron. think does, uneducated means don‚Äôt know taking about. B√•stad? Oh shit, that's dumb. perfect world, leaders would feel regret mismanaging crisis magnitude. far imperfect world possible. whole shit show become partisan. It‚Äôs re-elected. Deaths considered collateral damage war rationality. ""A recent study found COVID-19 coronavirus survive four hours copper, 24 hours cardboard, two three days plastic stainless steel. Jul 10, 2020"" stuff like surfaces contaminated need wiped (doors, counters, etc) touching orifices groceries. none. Grocery packaging kill viruses. Maybe odds lower contaminated less handling going (vs frequent touching doors counters) time put items cart, move around store, go register, etc, odds something particles land it. need wipe down? Maybe not, like everything else personal decision playing odds.

Also, ""We want assure currently evidence human animal food food packaging associated transmission #COVID19"" total BS, lack evidence proof. highly doubt testing scenario. still probably low-risk situation maybe many worth effort wipe stuff down, can't say bad idea feel like so. *‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking death proportion population,‚Äù¬†Swan said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs U.S. really bad. Much worse South Korea, Germany, etc.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt that,‚Äù Trump responded, prompting Swan ask, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt that?‚Äù*

Covid care try spin it...""it is"" getting crushed. Ugh would awful. talked news much hopefully soon. October around corner would taking bleach sticking light bulbs ass along masks. He's given up. So, that's thing left say. suppose mention greater issue. desperately need conclusive science supports issue. research far, understanding know droplets expelled nose mouth, masks seem positive impact reducing much potential shedding occur individual, asymptomatic not.

Limiting viral shedding positive impact transmission rate understanding. mean .. Wear mask + limiting droplet sharing = reduces spread virus?

I‚Äôm happy learn additional info, well negative aspects mask wearing. Thanks taking time share. truly together, even don‚Äôt agree everything. bother you.

As try make political issue, lies it.

The change constitution know it, Say true show news article constitutional reform.

Those protesting job situation lockdown, fact, Lot still job thanks lockdown.  heck even talking about? data want talking ""These people COVID"" epidemiologists plan response PCR tests. someone COVID May, impact current planning, including ""New positive case count"" expected. Rapid tests inaccurate enough get positive rapid test, first thing send get PCR test confirm. Sure, Texas dump data elsewhere, grand conspiracy hide current caseload. however end year bonus mysteriously directly proportional number sick days take.

You mean inversely proportional, right? school district's plan includes 4th graders sanitizing desks. hope enough sanitizer schools! It‚Äôs Israeli drug, hopefully people don‚Äôt boycott submission removed because

Curious there's concise listing Americans can/can travel to? plot armor get this. NYC cabs always plastic partition. would matter?  extrapolating data?

Ooh, there‚Äôs xkcd that! Indeed. yet people constantly new daily peaks here, regardless. Spending accountability major issue, needs complete review goals students complete public edu programs.

Honestly, I've always loved German school model.

Once graduate German HS, completed internships hireable field chosen go university. want change careers, get reeducated thru unemployment job placement programs.

In US, entire focus going University, don't, graduate skill set culture denounces trade work ""failure.""

Then become prey for-profit schools.

I'd say goal exiting US public edu program specific industry experience (vocation) recent grads employable track edu without sacrificing ""well rounded"" edu approach. simply agree message article bought paid special interest groups nationwide lockdown. seems bit conspiratorial me.

The reopen campaign astroturfed special interests. established fact. conspiracy. So, seems less likely folks responsible reopening suddenly lost interest we're talking whether lockdown.

We're also seeing many states adopting immunity bills protect people sued. threat... babies? ‚ÄúGood News‚Äù tag feels misleading AF. Definitely premature positivity. problem he's incapable looking far future. him, news pandemic causes economy falter, causes poll numbers sag. trying downplay news pandemic way back March, charade could possibly keep full eight months election. mentally capable comprehending immediate problems (a bad economy, bad poll numbers) incapable dealing anything might require elaborating planning, patience, long-term decision making.

And think we're going discussing catastrophic failure leadership long time start picking pieces. chapters discusses realities vs. fictions. since I've read idk find Nice! Welcome aboard.

My reply maybe clarify stats show COVID less lethal influenza minors. Still guess though. take attitude drunk driving?

Do take attitude toward it? reinstate prohibition. Ban alcohol everyone. drinking protects drinking protects you. 
  end day, personal risk tolerance. Im wearing mask, afraid drunks either. get it, hit called life. don‚Äôt know college delaying moving online-only courses financial reasons,because know online classes aren‚Äôt valuable students therefore want keep enrollment numbers up,or truly think they‚Äôll able open fall. COVID plan sounds whole mess. 92% classes person. want students go home quarantine. Whole classes going quarantined exposed,and professors get replacements symptomatic teach online. sounds complicated able implement correctly.

Oh,and still planning letting student life go normal. I‚Äôm sure groups 300 
 college kids socially distance rushing,nor understand somehow thousands students tailgating? happen whole fraternity gets exposed? Hundreds people quarantine guess? wish they‚Äôd move remote learning. Or, likely, kids spread virus Grandpa district panic-closes schools suburban moms suddenly change plans without warning again.

What replied factually inaccurate statement. biases clear, guy somebody, political reasons alone, enacted policies made sure people experienced seen? wish people would get serious take minor steps keep others safe. isn‚Äôt difficult.

I went Starbuck day. line literally front door social distancing, every fucking time someone walked situation, felt could walk inside stand *right* *behind* last person *inside.* people left without coffee this. notice long ass line? 

And mobile orders anymore one, people would mobile order *wait inside* instead waiting notification phone! tried putting Max capacity sign, work either. course, always asshole pulls masks talk barista! Ugh!

I've gone one years baristas nice deserve shit. we're hills Salinas, major hotspot Agriculture. 

I'm homeless wake 5am coffee day, fill thermus go back bed fuck people! really prove disprove dude's ""Your words nothing virtue signal people much pretending care them""

So point never challenged discussed, popped story national plan.

Basically peasants go back work, rich stays home watch stock market rise back labor (as well trillions Fed pumping stock market future tax payers repay).

If die, it, important. important people ones getting sick. know, it‚Äôs scary isn‚Äôt it. Covid exit strategy lot solution issue calling kids crammed classroom. need call companies allow employees work home. That‚Äôs convincing question. say ‚Äúhow many preventable child flu deaths okay with? We‚Äôre listening‚Äù School Districts still get it, they're supposed top academic minded people?! potentially bad news we're better prepared something like this. Maybe awareness possibilities encourage people mindful role helping stop crisis. feeling Getting paid money given tourist earning profits tourist? think money comes pay employees? 

You profit gain something, case money. *cries american* Wow extremely butthurt Americans ""hacking"" allegations country last line vaccine development. There's dignity left. Policy makers must also consider mounting evidence regarding COVID-19 children adolescents, including role may play transmission infection. **SARS-CoV-2 appears behave differently children adolescents common respiratory viruses,** influenza, much current guidance regarding school closures based. Although children adolescents play major role amplifying influenza outbreaks, date, **this appear case SARS-CoV-2.** Although many questions remain, preponderance evidence indicates children adolescents less likely symptomatic less likely severe disease resulting SARS-CoV-2 infection. addition, **children may less likely become infected spread infection.**

Emphasis would imagine would come company, kind like airlines telling people they're medically able wear mask flying right state dumbest? it? Exactly http://archive.is/MoDyW councilman used ""Then"" instead ""Than""? I‚Äôm sure take lol guess that‚Äôs lot people‚Äôs opinion going right now. parents equipped facilitate distant learning tf entire spine clench reading this? Move goalposts much? Young children required safety seat back car safest way transport them. safest way educate children HOME. Honestly may June early time make decision. surveys I'm talking due last Wednesday. Like district absolutely needs know who's going show day 1 idea. I've got daughter signed person schooling caught picked lottery magnet school like 70 kids it. expect us avoid virus feel lot better around thousand less people. goes sideways I'll able home school thankfully. going crazy matter what! Wtf 5??? That's insane....so basically get actually sick goes sick days? competent government looks like. Kudos Malaysia spending less time friends feeling alone. Yes, describes studies done, aren‚Äôt done yet Mm necessarily. body doesn‚Äôt keep antibodies you‚Äôve gotten sickness. ‚Äúformula‚Äù stored immune system quickly reproduce antibodies virus enter system. antibodies mean technically immune.  sad part politicians use every chance/second fuck around Funny like dumb people dead educated people alive . Obama would listened scientists start, something figured wrong needed changed, would've implemented change quickly possible.

Having said that, exactly deflecting? Watching flip papers around strange. one giant bar graph? print remedial versions positive things find make happy five seconds? Reminded elementary school worksheets teaching difference pie charts bar graphs got color different bars homework. posted site review data becomes available We‚Äôre nearing half way point bei deadliest event American history yeah guess could call deteriorating paranoia scratch?!? arm's off! need get kids back school asap grow doctors scientists nobody listens to. awesome news! Maybe enough people sounded alarm bring change. Way look one another! don‚Äôt think true. Anecdotally, city‚Äôs mask mandate, pretty progressive, science friendly city, 50% people stores wore masks. mandate started, almost 100% though 2 months later 75-80%

People US haven‚Äôt great wearing masks told even iffy many parts. Amazon might weather storm better than, say, airlines, mean prefer return normalcy.

I sure that. USA headed towards complete oligarchy small businesses go broke lockdowns. corporatism economic policy parties, core disagreements merely social issues identity politics. actual meaningful data there. doesn‚Äôt even say many people tried get 15 recoveries? That's pensions scam. trap job prevent quitting. spreading misinformation? said true?I genuinely baffled reaction me. 

If actual argument evidence would like hear please insult me, accuse chastising people lying saying banned. really, taking measures without due reason doesnt make sence. going chemo either. Preemptively, know, could possibly cancer, knows. take antibiotics either, possible case bacterial infection. World cannot work principle cant prove otherwise, claim stands. proving something isnt true much harder proving something true. Thats western world innocent proven guilty shit. principle. Wow that, provided zero counter arguments threw stupid statement response, solves nothing even true compared lives lost. would Obama done differently prevent covid getting established US? nice convo post-covid dating world. brings vulnerable topic purely personal safety standpoint. safe person you‚Äôre connecting being?

I wonder bullshit started Well hang stay safe. sounds pretty scary. Fyi netherlands sweden said make people wear masks scientific evidence actually work. 3 ICU beds South Lake, apparently there's 1 available we've shipping people UC Davis basin bc we're capacity. Also, TEXAS plates. MANY Texas license plates basin right now, least south shore. pretty pathetic LA, urban area spiking cases, feels safer Tahoe, probably is. fucking apes climbed tree. Completely false. many people contracted SARS US. Like got disease US. lockdown measures put place US prevent spread SARS? many people contracted Ebola US? know answer. zero. Americans overseas contracted Ebola brought treatment. handful healthcare workers treating Ebola victims caught it. That's it. stupid even remotely compare Ebola covid claim Ebola spread US Obama. That's utterly asinine. swine flu, I'll ask question again, kind lockdowns happened US result swine flu? many mandatory mask laws swine flu? Remember swine flu forced restaurants bars close? Remember major sports shut swine flu? Remember that. No, don't. happen. happen US happen anywhere else world either. took control hospitalization data. Tests deaths still reported usual. administration taking complete credit something can't directly control, quality healthcare country, taking credit something *does* control, public health measures.

Public health measures reduce case count. Quality healthcare reduces mortality rate. former US struggled massively South Korea, Australia, etc, succeeded, resulting tens thousands fewer deaths much lower death rate per capita.

""The buck stops here,"" unless Donald Trump. know I‚Äôm going downvoted, kids aren‚Äôt ones worrying about. real danger kids getting A-Systematic spreading adults. would request moderator follow this, post replied to, poster posting sub point time.

People claiming masks somehow fix everything. also cognitive dissonance thing isnt stay. think people change tunes months econony shit average age die still around 80.

Relax maybe try rephrase. theory, expanded unemployment supposed help with. course Congress can't get act together actually extend it. Arizona becoming shining example United States Hallie state dramatically reduce cases, hospitalizations, eventually deaths Covid without completely shutting entire economy. done this?

The rest state open, open since early May. surgeon July, numbers nearly falling cliff last weeks, especially hospitalizations.

This good news. means states, even countries, keep lid outbreaks shut entire economy. repeat, lock everything order bring numbers down. Arizona fantastic example that. care less agendas, really dont care anyone else matter. Says guy defending people responsible 150,000 American deaths.

In terms hospitalization numbers, can't hospitalization room naturally number come plateau rate people discharged + die. Copy link Archive.is if.. think wearing masks magically get rid unfortunately. Might slow sure. Even countries almost 100% mask wearing still cases eg. Spain. long haul unfortunately. two weeks: ""Covid rapidly spreading Indiana schools; hospitals overwhelmed.""   Nah, tired idiots making mess worse listening reason. No, won't. hits personally. fucking asshole going around entire thread spewing lies disinformation, throwing sorts personal insults every time called it.

I cannot believe sub better moderation. education really necessary people came ‚Äúeducated‚Äù think virus doesn‚Äôt matter?  didnt know children age 0-15 could drive?

A couple months ago (already quarantine Argentina) talked 70 years old uncle quarantine fucked plans bursted tears explaining may sad leisure trip Europe got busted know many years left losing one everything set move Europe retire (that dream since teenager) July. I'm sure many (or most) people cruises 70 years olds fearing may last chance take cruise trip, understand that, yes, actually pretty hard ""sit still year"", even that's ignoring losing job company. Aw, I‚Äôm teacher doubt hates haha. Children‚Äôs attention retention wrapped environment expectations.

Feel free ignore, advice I‚Äôve given friends asked it:

If you‚Äôre forced learn home year recommend design little work space (doesn‚Äôt need elaborate, sister‚Äôs old play table closet lmao), keeping simple schedule time learn (do deviate, even convenient you) make sure always reinforce rules, give first five twenty times misbehaves runs off. Try keep cool. might two three rough weeks beginning, creates habits next several months. Yeap, Went subway earlier pick sandwich lunch. Several people line, one wearing mask. employees were. North Carolina BTW. that's transimission works. Quit pretending understand. Federally orchestrated, state administrated. Sure. Let tens thousands in. Pack together. ok. What's worst could happen? We're freaking pandemic anything./s

You ask this, rhetorically, pretend data evidence studies whatsoever, use chastise people believing personal POV fact based whatsoever.

You spreading disinformation purpose here.

And people call it, start levelling insults.

You behaving badly spreading dangerous disinformation _knowingly_. behaving like absolute piece shit.

I quite certain time mods get around reading lies pushing thread find banned sub. Absolutely fucking disgusting. Democrat governor means nothing. example, Steve Sisolak Nevada.

Having new President experience pandemics epidemics would better, yes. Especially Democrats control Senate hold House. would nexus real substantive change. Even Bruce Vilanch?? link shows California second lowest Midwest (typically red) highest, wouldn‚Äôt exactly call south dumbest...

How don‚Äôt stereotype millions people? didn‚Äôt even get infected school dingus. literally got home. reason didn‚Äôt spread school everyone wore masks sat 6 feet away. no, go set back entire generation children‚Äôs education doesn‚Äôt fit agenda. site science. science points use able open schools safely. mentioned important point ‚Äî trying things don‚Äôt seem possible right now.

Planes, closed high occupancy vehicles, indoor high occupancy settings... Pretty much anything close proximity, walls, people.

What hell time alive. know humanity creates order come profound. Advances education need happen (seems like remote learning could important future), need rethink plan kinds disasters.

It‚Äôs sad seeing friends businesses look every bit worth desperately try hold it. give current president ideas Exactly. I've watched death rate US (per Worldometer) drop 12% 6%. Best tell, change largely attributable availability testing change actual survival, though I'm expert. cancer diagnosis 88% 94% chance surviving, I'd grateful odds favor. bloody well go voluntarily get cancer survival rate pretty good! certainly cavalier friends family getting it, would make it. weirdest damn perspective, one that's got go right window someone love make it. started end April Nevada side open CA closed, even T‚Äôs packed Californians buying beer. local private IVGID beach PACKED Californians Arizonans buying short term rentals using punch cards access what‚Äôs supposed limits non-locals. know locals area CA plates walk beach‚Äî parking lot filled CA AZ UT license plates. masks anywhere. left parents‚Äô place LA two weeks ago thought would safer far think I‚Äôm right, least people wearing masks.

Many weren‚Äôt ever waiting vaccine begin don‚Äôt need mental gymnastics, look excess deaths far, C-19 deaths, consider others aggressive socially harmful strategies seeing resurgences, Sweden not.

Everyone focused C-19 not, forget loss life loss life, matter cause. less Criminal record, Mental patient ward record, people mentally unstable need removed society,i care seems unreasonable evil ever detriment society need helped/controlled can't dealt normal standards.

TL:DR 

America/the world needs institute Psych ward hospitals,sanitariums multiply 1,000 20? right now, California 9,441 deaths 516,839 deaths, making 1.8% mortality (this total, accounting mortality risk increases age either, entire population confirmed vs died. couldn‚Äôt get one go store could stay home compromised immune system? generally good practice confidently tout opinions around facts know talking  don‚Äôt mean take anything away story poor woman assaulted, it‚Äôs middle pandemic. compromised immune system. would risk shopping Pier 1? poor child :( feel bad daughter I-80 Covid Road.

And absolutely agree! negative encounters always tried understanding compassionate, people aren‚Äôt truly monsters match calm tone. 

I think that‚Äôs good way be. Don‚Äôt kill pleasing people still kind. always try live kindly, others myself. Sometimes kind means dealing unkindness others. ‚ÄúDo harm take shit‚Äù Director film Joel Schumacher recently died well. like film, might also like Edmond, much less comedic take similar material starring William H Macy directed another genre legend recently passed, Stuart Gordon.  district manager take seriously? worked retail, dumb customers wrong wasn‚Äôt big deal.

Find friend let kids remote find another way. kids stay grandparents, possible. A. way would lock Australia logistics-wise way would lockdown Melbourne two different things really comparable.

B. people dying probably need to. Unnecessary death stage like horror. 20 people died last 2 days probably need outbreak contained properly beginning. Rest world: *wears masks &amp; social distances*

Americans: ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM GONNA COUGH CAUSE THINK VIRUS!!‚Äù ppe doctors wear supposed protect them...the cloth masks supposed protect people around you. totally different issue. certain hope so! Unless I‚Äôm missing something, doesn‚Äôt make sense they‚Äôre not. Trump get locked up? Love see people get deserve UK given set restrictions, usually need stay home leave work, cannot touch specific people related crime investigated etc. taking money unusual, person risk flight. breaching restrictions mean end jail. Seems like pay super human.

Cancel it, cancel - cares? spoiled brats represent none us. Let eat cake. Weird worldometers lists US 570 deaths... seems unlikely low Texas alone pulling 250 pretty pathetic tbh  Pay everybody scared stay home.   

Everybody else lives lives.

Not many people lining get plane contribute herd immunity Fun question! NEVER vaccine? suppose do? Yup. change fact median saving account balance US $7000.

I hope people start listening real doctors scientific community, wear masks, stop getting news ""Totally Unbiased"" Farsebook feeds. push it, mass murder perhaps. wouldn't, since number people disease 3-6 months ago low. does. sets precedent people spitting coughing one another arrestable offense. hours video showing rioters officers law.

People innocent avoid incarceration still incentive show hearing. Cool. Got it. Couple scenarios wanna run you, though:

1. Someone innocent proven guilty, unable provide money needed bond. person options available them, sure; hope friends family scrounge money, utilize services bondsman, start. well good, remember core discussion, even explicitly addressed it, differential treatment people means without. hypothetical person without means would owe debt, whether formalized, contractual debt bondsman informal debt aforementioned friends family. (Or, possibly, formalized, contractual debt friends family, depending amicable relationship there.)
2. Someone who, whatever reason, concludes getting hell area best option, even means losing bond money facing legal repercussions road. people, money they're may represent small enough portion overall wealth losing matter, may feel confident enough power wealth protect future legal issues related fleeing justice. short, people, monetary bond necessarily represent incentive appear court.

...retirement savings Accounts? Various types banking? Counting investments? end amount uncertainty given article. dont clearly defined data set. dont know rules picked. relevant study works context. context Designed. context gives meaning otherwise meaningless numbers. context isnt understood one cannot simply Jump leaps bounds declare Information x valid scenario y.

Statistics, even though missused alot ways, especially shady Media Outlets, applicable context dependent. 

For example question Hand one ask much money american average spend shorttime emergency. way answer 753$ alot nah part. 

But u comparing scenario people different parts Investment probably partly accesible Penaltys withdrawal generally locked retirement even those. adding dont even know study considered property part value. much ur house might worth u bought build one etc. dont even know asked. part Population interviewed this. Probably homeless jeff around corner ur local burger joint.

So god damn many unknowns.


Aaaaaand top aaaall of, study ever talks whole Population Nation asked everyone. ask u? Aaall studies is: take sample size certain group people, defined arbitrarily chosen variable, ask maybe 50? really good cases maybe around 5k-10k people (which REALLY good cases super fucking rare). 

And answers extrapolate findings ASSUME reflect whole Population. course statistics ways prevent mishaps happening many ways ask question right way ur data fits. really u ask right way u always get weird Form ""proof"". mean flat earthers exist.

All say: u dont know asked questions u really cant judge study. Especially since Media doesnt scientific Standard reporting whatever findings Think have. scientific papers get misquoted whole lot. people twist things way want be. much might wanna believe ,mathmetics isnt unflinching truth say is. tool Used flawed beings.

3. matter method chosen, discouraged presented actual, verifiable numbers (Tests Given Day)+(number tests came back positive Covid-19)+(the percentage results real verifiable sources, still downvoted *facts*.

(I thought group trusts science. Senator Inholef brings snowball Congress ""prove Climate Change hoax."" - better that.)

Linear mixed models revealed significant effect mandated BCG policies growth rate cases deaths controlling median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism). analysis suggests mandated BCG vaccination effective fight COVID-19.

What kind standard deviation graph peak yet happen? I'm Japan anecdote women wearing masks frequency men. around 97% masked 3% maskless busy areas. 

People bikes likely wearing masks.

(It zero) need guns got hugs. OMG day going insanely good biopic life thing. would watch shit movie. Calling Brad Pitt... People might wonder Texas case rates might turning around without much government intervention (if numbers genuinely turning around) stories like these, happening hundreds times day. live Texas, there's good chance know someone died know people grieving. absence leadership empathy compassion win.

It's shame took many deaths people take seriously. know way back deaths curve much longer tragic way up.

Technically third opinion unfortunately poison pill many people cross..  Rum 151 hand lotion works nicely. Quoting you:""... dangerous..."" So, confirm gyms dangerous. make point me. let make one you: Protestors outdoors, wearing masks gotten public infected. also tend always moving, making spread outdoors extremely difficult. That's fine someone money afford tickets every year, ton people paid season tickets lost income dont extra money sit tickets another year want entertainment dollars something else decision made *because* coronavirus. literally first sentence article. Next time try reading it? Pretty much this. 

They go somewhere free valuable needed space hospitals. 
It‚Äôs riskier remain hospital care nursing homes (to patient) due infection risk. 

But bottom line must move patients hospitals possible room treat new cases rather quickly. people think they're invulnerable taking vitamin D, cause ignorance science. mean advice take vitamin good health advice general. good night's sleep. soon too. keep hearing storm isn‚Äôt bad everyone thought, it‚Äôs somehow bad enough stop reporting cases.

Just like it‚Äôs dangerous media attend Republican National Convention, it‚Äôs okay kids return school.

I‚Äôm getting really tired double-think. Good read I‚Äôve read pieces wonder it‚Äôs getting press trust friend pandemic ends. ""horror"" see thing nearly controlled blew back knocking everyone back. hopes Australian economy rebounding quickly proxy helping New Zealand probably dashed next year. know talking many people New Zealand feel pretty safe little bubble right know people would freak cluster broke Auckland right now. I'm confident could control it, detected early, would damage psyche moral have. fragility thing see best way forward right keeping economy moving forward can't afford setbacks. That's ""horror"" see look what's going Melbourne. never said vaccine impossible. said plans impossible? took like 15 comments get personal answer. think lockdowns go eternally event vaccine impossible? /s cowards afraid downvotes.  went dentist recently, fine. get dentist temp taken, wash hands, mask. Everybody masked gloved up, isolated stations. 

Probably safe could considering. imagine air conditioning system ship capability filter respiratory droplets viruses, crews sleep tight quarters, eat pack shared spaces. USA conservative country, everyone‚Äôs mindset ‚Äúfuck got mine‚Äù save sane people. know. Sadness. partner met looking forward seeing campmates. :( White House control anything. HHS.

Beyond that, reporting changed *hospital reporting data*. Nothing case counts, positive rates, death counts, anything else comes state health departments.

Amazing many people misinformed this. lmao. idea evil US world. hope son gets well soon.  Absolutely correct, I'm type 2 diabetic 2018 pneumonia 3 times, day one I've completely freaked every time go out. first 6 weeks quarantine never even left house.  sound like sort person would attend Covid parties. 

Please reproduce. Without testing contact tracing, almost impossible say got infected. Okay see pattern. Let's see numbers tomorrow. I'm super skeptical cases. Look long took start flatten curve spring lockdown virus nowhere near widespread now. live California, know many people it, know I've avoided getting it. Florida meth answer lot questions.

Wendy‚Äôs portion sizes shrunk like 2008.

Cold air also give us runny noses, creating another potential increase droplet spread. me, rides park experience. age 14 on, never cared characters, parades, cotton candy.

I still go now, see fewer people park would big plus people. bar pretty high that. whole Senate bluffing bargaining chip right disingenuous. friend works McDonald's reopened indoor dine-in. told keep windows closed AC on. going end well. Actually, odds last second generation. Much less third. person asking question apparently unaware citing studies wound down, discontinued never actually RCT valid ""ongoing trials"", likely.

I doubt malicious question (maybe disingenuous?) unfortunate truth commenters always patient get initial premise wrong, esp. widely-publicized topics. needed national plan month arrived U. S. shit show!

An anecdotal approach public safety risk factors sound basis analysis public policy. Idk... dumb alive sounds like boomers... that‚Äôs really working us should. like I'll trust rather dumbasses understand everyone making minimum wage right? Unemployment high end equivalent 50k year. Speak going propose changes things know anything st least try get numbers right. clear, indicates 65-70% *responses test* support re-opening. tell us many parents support.

An extreme example illustrate point would school sent surveys 1,000 parents, 100 responded, 70 said reopen. 930 parents either want re-opened opinion see responses survey data (unless also indicated many surveys went many returned).

Whenever numbers provided, results questioned.

In addition that, know question asked. asked parents whether would rather educate children home (unclear whether would online electronic devices would provided) send school...but parents working question invalid (doesn't ask surveyor trying ascertain) really probing whether parents adequate supervision children rather feel children's education particular.

When provide questions survey, results scrutinized. lack contact tracing fucked response. 

It‚Äôs also rough needed contract tracing jump. ""Mentioning Chicago"" racist? places people talk about? could make conspiracy theory create YouTube video could convince 50% good idea Exceptionally inaccurate/misleading reporting CNN. get sharknados though.

Yeah, I'm liking situation US right now. makes angry see many people taking seriously bored feel invincible.

You you. scared stay home.

When set camps first line get in, **JUST GO CAMP!** completely bungled first shutdown failing take seriously. 20 day intense shutdown, rather 4 month mess we‚Äôve had, would far greater position. terms economy pandemic.

But right now, dismissing anyone saying ‚Äúhey, people losing jobs careers‚Äù ‚Äúlicking rich people‚Äôs boots‚Äù whatever wrong. Israel beaten numbers way reopened, we're already midst uncontrolled spread many states. additional spike now...

It's likely takes two three weeks notice conditions. pass holder great. one you. Ride can, pictures without crowds. Best time go next hurricane. quiet too. link peer reviewed studies claiming use undiagnosed COVID online surveys? double blind see issue since pools people same. One gets placebo drug, enough participants see statistically significant difference reported outcomes.

This study looked several thousand hospital found another used confirmed COVID work.  I‚Äôm definitely denial, agree America shit show. There‚Äôs plenty evidence failure every level. live NY, done good job relatively speaking it‚Äôs going backwards again. There‚Äôs plenty misinformation government, don‚Äôt need headlines exacerbate that. articles headline makes sound like cover up, reading actual article says what‚Äôs tested (Covid vs antibodies vs antigens) last two tests unreliable, can‚Äôt ‚Äòconfirm‚Äô case make case ‚Äòprobable‚Äô. 

We need better. I‚Äôd love charge more, I‚Äôm not. depends Canada you‚Äôre talking about. area announced school buses number children, assigned seating ensure contact others limited. wasn‚Äôt enough seating begin with... little guys crammed like sardines. Texan, never miss opportunity roast Louisiana! Dr. Scott Miscovich, leads broad testing efforts across islands, said surge state ready, least contact tracing testing standpoint, handle it.

‚ÄúContact tracing goes hand-in-hand need increase testing, especially prevent biggest issue Oahu, disease spreading families,‚Äù Miscovich said.

Miscovich said organization, Premier Medical Group, identifying 20 30 positives every days. Miscovich said discussions patients contact tracers indicate ‚Äúprocess overwhelmed surge volume.‚Äù

To effective, Miscovich said, contact tracing conducted within 24 hours, longer 48 hours.

‚ÄúI certain overworked staff ability effectively ‚Äî dedicated, hardworking employees, tremendously overworked understaffed,‚Äù said.

Miscovich said DOH‚Äôs thinly stretched team tracers ‚Äúset failure,‚Äù especially coupled serious concerns shortage lab access.

‚ÄúUntil address two issues, lack same-day turnaround testing lack adequate contact tracing, ‚Ä¶ disease overtake island Oahu,‚Äù said. it‚Äôs still Mississippi know right, people loosing flipping mind! feel like stepped back intellectually 200 years. Seems people adopting anti science pro conspiracy attitude. Never mind cognitive dissidence/selfishness....hard tell one really is. they've spent whole lives thinking believe something it'll true anything. need soak 10 minutes actually disinfect.

The issue schools great equalizer. Students get free reduced price food, essentially palatable welfare--it's okay kids receiving help, right? Students free WiFi and, least state, personal laptop disposal...at school. talk virtual learning 'ineffective', we're talking kids access home kids whose parents never board begin with. Either way, students teachers die kids go daycare.

The phase 1/2 trials start September manufacturers saying next year Sanofi leading clinical development registration COVID-19 vaccine expects Phase 1/2 study start September, followed Phase 3 study end 2020. data positive, companies request US regulatory approval **in first half 2021.** work school Arizona. people back office wearing masks. mother works different school district. went building today people didn‚Äôt masks on. outbreaks Arizona schools student ever sets foot them. Yeah that's still happening btw That's fair enough, I'm British see much stuff (yet) /u/pcbuilder1907 full shit think question ""where"" going send instead. need proper facilities skilled nurses take care high need patients maybe dementia families can't come visit help. patients get go home familiar surroundings often risk confusion falls. places also fully funded.

It‚Äôs effective non-disruptive. Huge invasive sacrifices daily life, money socialization ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù solutions. Maybe. Every doctor seen past 20 years tried give drugs. Things like statin drugs (borderline), paxil (for IBS!), thyroid (borderline). really needed lose lbs get exercise, that, fine. 

Just couple weeks ago mentioned stressed pandemic got offered valium. need pill get stressful situation. 

A back sprained ankle got offered narcotics. Antibiotics time, even showing signs infection. Dental procedures come lots drugs.
 
Then there's drugs see TV, catchy songs turn ear worms burrowing brain. psoriasis? Leg spasms night? Irregular pee habits? Arthritic hands? There's pill that.

I know pills causes brain fog, unprofessional opinion is, take bunch together time, drink alcohol too, brain favors. true.

That's counting merchandise food sales. 

Many college's budgets based around football program. That's head football coaches often highest paid state employee many states. makes perfect sense concussions. text gets sent saying someone got sick, (not who) contact person. Random.... better checking everybody every day unrandomly? sneak virus looking? nowhere close 100% protected N95 unless sealed goggles well

Your eyes way exposed easier catch virus nose Right. manage logistics all... manufacturing distribution. Then, figure gets first doses... mean brainer medical personal high risk population. then, what? good percentage anti-vaxxer matter proof show them. guess make sure loved ones get vaccinated hope enough rest population same.  one thanking China.

100-200 cases lot. Looks like lucha libre moved aire libre. 

(fresh air- saved ten seconds) Oh come on. know died fire /s literally whatever hell want could die tomorrow, probably covid. us could. I‚Äôd damn pissed spent final year even rich vs poor. might consider somebody earns million year ""rich,"" that's still pocket change ultra-wealthy means production, distribution, exchange. 

It's owning class vs working class. 

And ""owning class"" mean ""owner"" mom &amp; pop small business 90% equity tied debts loans. I'm talking banks. governors nothing following party line set president.

Colder weather lowers immune system readiness, etc. Wow, teams, coaches, staff, etc. well? don‚Äôt explain since seem antagonizing it? That's thing, simulations lab conditions mean happens real world. like early reports sayifn virus viable various surfaces x amount time except representative real world all

Medicine science evidence based . Much like drugs elicit certain response petri dish animals verified observed humans real conditions, confirmed verified need to, I'm familiar it. research project prepare pandemic response (sure wish used findings came research). Funded Gates foundation. 

Is go tell us Bill Gates gonna put microchip everyone mark beast rapture starts? American people. act like $600 bonus hasnt extremely controversial Well hes still got mind right quit anytime great, great , great grandkids dont worry either point, bothered Tiktok. Banning Tiktok much important global pandemic /s

Priorities init. Ah, makes sense. read comment thinking universal description (then feels like bad joke). put ""in Sweden"" front everything reasonable.

On personal perception, maybe good luck bad luck? know, many factors... case know 2 young people died (in 20s 30s). friend friend med school, friend's school mate. friend friend (20s) induced coma ICU month (he survived) another friend friend (20s) got severely ill survived, sequel got cerebral thrombosis ~~is fighting life~~ dead. know of, lost count, maybe \~10-15 dead people, mostly older adults (50s up). They're mostly family friends, family friends (fathers, uncles. higher mortality men notorious), people related family business (personnel businesses worked relatives died).

But again, country bit chubby healthy habits (mostly fried stuffs rice, unlike Mediterranean diet) lack exercise. wealthy choice go work, infection massive. Hospitals collapsed even tanks oxygen everyone, people die even reaching bed, waiting line.

Well, sorry rant... I'm happy hear situation good country :) need endure weeks. far family lucky.

Edit: guy cerebral thrombosis died. updated answer. think ""lockdown"" means different things different people. expectation bars movie theaters closes long haul think anyone veiling feelings Ron DeSantis. 

And yeah, 150k+ people dying SPRING SUMMER...definitely flu. People must understand pandemic times babies must delivered old fashion way: *at home* ! 50 countries lower deaths per capita. suspect too? Rest peace. anti-maskers Australia, too? /facepalm

I can‚Äôt believe live here. Whole state head ass. Armed protests mask mandate area. Protesting wearing mask like protesting sandals socks. point? No. We've gotten new cases drop finally like everyone else. luck out, took us lot longer we're now. months ago would said there's wY reopen see can't everyone else is. wait come Austin, Texas. literal flavelas growing every day amongst piles trash every underpass. becoming humanitarian crisis. Exactly. would willingly put min. two weeks max several months hell could wear damn mask? Yes, economy. truth people selfish idea going one summer without annual family vacation much them.

I vacation wait year gladly able actually enjoy worry getting covid. Wrong. covid nose swab implants chip, vaccine activates /s awful heat AZ, escaping either. really hard people know carrying though everything fine. We've home since middle March, hate feeling though there's end sight.

Thnk much that. Till someone brings M16 There've entities creating rules thousands years, irresponsible people breaking rules long. Biologically, difficult virus mutate fast. believe me, look up, pretty slow mutating virus far RNA viruses go.

A mutation virus evolving new pokemon something like that. replication error. strand RNA might look something like this

""aug gag agc cuu guc ccu ggu...""

during replication, letters might dropped, leading something like 

""aug agc cuu guc ccu ggu...""

Another error entire sequence could shifted one. (genes always read groups 3). would look like

""au gga gag ccu ugu ccc ugg u...""

You may wonder, errors common replication DNA RNA, human beings even alive giant balls mutant cancer?

Like said, ""junk DNA"" safeguard. mechanisms place too, like ""proofreading"" talked about.

The vaccines targeting spike proteins, proteins weapon virus. They're attack surface cells virus get inside. mutation spike proteins would mean weapon changing. change, statistically, likely benefit virus. would likely would change become like coronaviruses less deadly spike proteins.

Based slow virus mutate, nearly impossible mutated vaccine work time comes out. there's chance mutated form, however long takes come around, less deadly therefore need vaccine anyway.

I hope consider getting vaccine becomes available. two concerning things ""mutation"" able manufacture enough vaccine, SARS-COV-2 like HIV attacks immune system itself. Monday always lower numbers 60. previous numbers tues-sat 145-230. plus White House reporting numbers hard say truth them. week show lot since long enough CDC turned reporting.

Do better explanation growing body evidence even cloth masks without significant standalone filtering capability preventing spread? Cloth masks catch micro droplets carrying virus otherwise evaporate leaving behind droplet nuclei remain airborne essentially long takes environment inactivate sunlight and/or desiccation.

Months on, stores still mostly advertising products labeled 'anti-bacterial'.

Unless reason believe someone coughed past hour so, highly unlikely get infected surface. "" opinion, chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough sneeze (within 1‚Äì2 h). disagree erring side caution, go extremes justified data.

"" opinion piece, backed evidence review article: ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Now, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. 

The issue droplet aerosol less clear. summary sounds correct, understanding droplet spread common, aerosol spread happen significantly less likely, case studies indicted spread probably happened via aerosol sized particles happened person room infectious person long time (over 30 min) possibly require artificial air currents blow aerosol particles continuously, see case studies 2 3  brief contact unlikely result aerosol spread, mask wearing recommended indoors regardless distance others.

And honestly, since cases skyrocketing, shouldn‚Äôt government revisit decision open gyms, allowing gatherings 500 people etc. stop skyrocketing. mean, can‚Äôt reverse trend opening more! heard ancient dragons wearing protesting can‚Äôt breathe (fire). I'd understanding thathat many banks giving landlords breaks, except Bank America. Also surprised many landlords property. [The CDC MAIN way virus spreads close contact people via droplets. Fomites, infected objects, thought play major role. stop washing hands avoiding touching face, major controls best spent protecting nose mouth,and physically distancing others. relationship viral load severity, face coverings 100% effective, could lower severity illness. [Dr. Fauci recently suggested eye protection well mask. Hah Definitely think even without 100% compliance, changes Texas made effective Houston area (which article about). Anecdotally, seen excellent mask compliance part town since city mandate. part town intersection multiple different cultures (lots taco trucks, business signs Korean, fancy Whole Foods) Dan Crenshaw's (R) district. Even panhandlers wearing masks. Texas also shut bars down, reduced indoor restaurant capacity back 50%.

[TMC's ICU back normal capacity first time declined 14 straight days. worst got TMC 2-3 weeks changes implemented (Houston's city mask mandate slightly state's). idea talking about. parents need jobs support children. That's difference reality delusion drawing lot conclusions one comment Yep. lost bunch hair recovering severe illness two years ago. grow back months. serious? HCQ work properly needs administered early someone infected, also need proper dosage high dosage lead issues like heart problems (at least one so-called properly executed study administered way high dosage), need add zinc well treatment. well known, still study like done yet. cares studies double blind randomized give HCQ late stage? That's like giving someone parachute they're 20 meters ground, say look study proves parachutes safe!

Something clearly right here, certainly convinced otherwise. I've science life, appalling way science. shows politicized science science, money talks decides studies get done don't. obnoxiously vocal minority whatever get thing control.

But squeaky wheel gets grease America. Yeah funny everyone bioterrorist. Humans threat other

Nothing good come this, like nothing good came 9/11 California Florida much Fd up! Americans guess. really still this..? muh reelection control elsewhere. hover 21 32 states spikes. Florida, Texas, Arizona proof control. belong autoimmune club. yeah, folks selfish want politicize decent human
 one's lives matters yet folks refuse see much less accept Can‚Äôt that-dead people don‚Äôt bring revenue. seriousness hope pandemic impetus lot change. It‚Äôs def aired lot dirty laundry whole world see reasonable extrapolation. Otherweise, seen much reporting. often case, huge problem ""news"". News 11 usually ""everything working fine"", that's considered news. Correct. Add massive Crush Chevy. Tell Mitch McConnell Nope Don‚Äôt forget least healthy, too! ""Testing itself"" tells people whether virus not. Clearly, ""absolutely nothing"". matters, since Sweden *only* ""testing itself"". 

Before ramping testing, banned gatherings 50 people, banned visits nursing homes protect elderly, closed secondary schools universities, asked citizens social distance much could, did. without adequate testing, results poor.

Now, seeing 200 cases per day, 1,100 cases per day peak 600 cases per day ramped testing. would start wearing masks, daily cases could drop South Korean levels. Listen man, quarantine shut class school every time someone gets covid, there's literally way functioning school ever covid eradicated. Look long took polio vaccine (as example) polio eradication. decades.

Right fear unkown. think shut hospitals, test send everyone home someone nursing unit gets covid? think techs dropping sick left right? No, something deal with. 

Teachers get hide homes pretend online education years acceptable worried. isn't. virus SARS-CoV-2 causes disease COVID-19. 

SARS-COVID-2 thing. I've mentioned one Covid19 subs used know elderly man sold home essentially living retirement onboard long-duration cruises. returned states he'd stay sister's house couple weeks.

He still able enough walk, even jog, cruises comparable price maintaining house taxes, utilities, feeding oneself paying maid, etc... less replacement end-of-life nursing homes replacement expensive retirement lifestyle condo golf course. reopening schools even considered right now? outbreaks hit hard fast, thousands lives lost, they‚Äôll forced shut soon. anyone really think they‚Äôll able make whole school year without shutting down? There‚Äôs absolutely way. Opening schools bad idea. total, 250,000 Norwegian patients operations **or examinations** postponed corona crisis, according newspaper VG.

Yeah, really broken there. Another person posted apples apples teacher working part time pregnancy, qualify guaranteed medical leave. pregnancy run problems missed many days, could fired. Four days planned C section college turning students' graded final exams. Land free, right...? wholeheartedly agree Plus businesses seem forcing people back work, people faced lose benifits, Also, mindset people, workers would end sitting butt collecting money, give much stimius money, cases, all. agree mindset. anti-maskers read Devastating': Fort Lauderdale Man Lost Bakery ~~Dies~~ Due COVID-19 Even perfect PPE, one slip getting mean infection. take many times, lots small chances add big possibility exposure. 3 feet nothing. know furry need look NSFW

Right, sure, said absolutely nothing sort. So, short version ""We're going really bad situation fall."" Indianapolis unsettling. currently live Florida wear washable mask work 8 hours day due mandate ridiculous infection rates. Indiana students teachers, feel sorry you. Stick country since early April. even employed actual ""ambassadors"" lost jobs patrolling. First timers $300, repeaters $1000 third time, go court get charged, foreigner, straight deported never allowed anymore. pretty effective far, definitely afraid virus, also afraid losing money Seems dramatic. many kids 18 died far? really goes entire US mindset. whole system, exists today, individualism greater good damned. moved Ecuador 3 years ago. fist time line bank guy front left 5 minutes later came back tried get back spot. ready fight. Literally. fight flight response kicked in, face flushed got adrenaline boost like donkey Kong. Turns getting spot back line completely normal behavior here. know small example example permiates culture. one one all. know US caring great depression. grandparents told stories. system US designed trick people thinking greed good neighbors life matter. better scientist would wrong begin with. Nyet. Rifle fine. could see Trump wanting #2 #1. amazes well know Swedes know, think behave. pretty pretty clear media visit tourist least six nights booked, shorter valid reasons. Obviously miss hear friend read headline, would probably look details departure though. article even mention Swedes get turned back border this, implying, informs more, saying media fails do. wow, home made hasmat suit, nice. protect properly like fine, given know undress handle potentially contaminated protection equipment. take PCR test covid, tested active infection resulting catching virus 2-10 days prior earlier. Yes range high, sovis incubation period. definitely would positive caught right test, virus needs least 48 hours replication become infectious. 
BTW people India cough much. Literarly put 100 people room, like cinema, sports match, theatre something, every 5 seconds somebody clearing throat, like super annoying. Turn air recirculation off. experience people think they're ""woke"" believe COVID hoax. people know going bars, engaging risky behavior, identify entire social experience around going restaurants bars. They're lost without random social interaction getting drunk sitting bar talking hot bartender, watching sporting event, talking random people .0001% chance might get laid. 

While rest friend group figured things (more golf, distanced outdoor gatherings, playing games zoom/twitch) wait go back normal. One people got COVID month ago 5 weeks later sure shit back posting FB pictures bar next day posting pictures holding newborn niece without mask (!!!!!!).

So think mixture things, covid deniers/people think they're woke. media turist booker? media keep Public date travel restrictions? gona travel somewhere research. individual responsibility. call *Dunning-Kruger Exploitation* something - exploiting people dumb know better telling they're smart. like religions. 2 ways would ever possible: 1) bloody miracle. 2) morally ambiguous use firearms. absolutely zero evidence COVID spreads easily measles. None. Measles contagious orders magnitude. Edit: interesting people downvoted comment wanting read study. Interesting group here!

You're trying ruin echo chamber. course downvoted.

Any time someone gets downvoted asking question, community reveals garbage automatically gives credibility question.

If guys like question, fine. Answer sources move on. downvote like bunch cowards goes narrative. get superiority high preferring one version game versions. think yearly pass like shorter lines. Actually can, difficult. Looks like 43% republicans buy Trumps lie USA much testing that‚Äôs reason many cases. take-out orders enough keep going much longer. family closed permanently close store.



If Freedumb loving people Florida anything like Freedumb loving people state, probably avoid businesses they've supported years went strictly takeout required masks. Even county guidelines. 

 freely talk going new barbers restaurants regulars dine in, required face masks. Often litteraly driving across county lines, counties lax requirements.

Then turn around whine businesses tough, countries wanting raise property taxes sales taxes down. think could element confirmation bias considering Reddit majority American subreddits highlight preconceived notions? Ireland growing anti-mask community see videos online. obviously never sued anyone. No, implied. meant exactly said. I'm obligation ""explain"" assertions never made. Right, Covid spreads groups less 20k protesting. forgot dealing socially conscious virus. Nice! I'm Bengals fan feel kindred spirit Bills ever since knocked Baltimore end Buffalo's playoff drought. think time Bengals Bills take AFC. Yeah, inevitable outcome allowing infection spread controlled rate population. Sweden's neighbors care debt, much much much smaller. like death tolls much smaller. hate generalize always many cases know share experience. I've never seen antimasker outside US. seen plenty skeptics selfish people thought mask hot comply time. always older folks rather young. headline makes sound like flight, actually spread 21 different flights Classic quote: Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that. remember jets came around April, see though, actually working. problem we‚Äôve repeatedly told ‚Äúchildren don‚Äôt get it‚Äù ‚Äúchildren don‚Äôt spread it‚Äù. Many people bought story that, combined desperation difficulty online teaching, driving polls.

Once cases mount becomes obvious kids get/spread it, they‚Äôll shift course fast (at least sane states.) driven mask on. It‚Äôs easier way you‚Äôre car real quick store store. don‚Äôt feel need rip mask face second store. apply him? living human being.

In country outbreak small town near me. upheld rules still one infected whole cafe whilst symptoms himself. It‚Äôs hard taking precautions seriously times seems random people get infected. 

In country pretty good corona. Almost none icu. Also pandemic team told government wearing masks public isn‚Äôt necessary it‚Äôs proven work. honestly agree that. Outdoors keeping distance enough. people assume probably live bad country, don‚Äôt . live Netherlands. wonder they'll show nonchalance loved ones dying respirator They're pointing obvious truth: family blames everyone person already skis beating odds. Nobody necessarily blame. matter 'dumb'. matter 'antagonistic, stubborn, unwilling admit wrong'. are. things trademark male attributes (even though many women possess well ofc). weekends tend low Mondays/Tuesdays tend higher lack reporting weekend. That‚Äôs pattern start. understanding, anomaly yesterday‚Äôs death figure fit pattern?

&amp;#x200B;

Arrogance stupidity go hand hand.

Most guys overweight, unhealthy, likely wont survive infection. That‚Äôs shit headline clicks. Good. go lock somewhere. 160,000 dead says it‚Äôs control. Fucking sociopath. do. think trying come justifications wearing mask whatever, otherwise would try downplay death someone's husband, father grandfather? It‚Äôs great DN pushes FHM/Tegnell point bit. really absurd Sweden‚Äôs entire strategy predicated Swedish populace able follow FHM‚Äôs directives, think Swedes somehow incapable figuring masks. 

It also seems like *no one* FHM reads recent scientific literature. There‚Äôs research shows masks reduce face touching: also increase adherence social distancing: issue Sweden caves faster TTI rest Nordics opt mass masking part strategies. educated county entire US South (Arlington County). Get stereotypes. Archive link: Swedish Public Health Agency believes risk infection increase face masks used incorrectly recommend used. time, people wear face masks society Sweden daily basis. Nevertheless, clear instructions relevant.

**‚ÄúA face mask itches goes nose contributes hands often touching mouth, eyes nose, increase risk infection spreading. also contribute people mild symptoms entering society, could increase spread infection. ‚Äù, authority writes website**. follow development knowledge examine different sources, write. 

Regardless authority's position, open anyone wants use face masks freely. Anyone moved streets Stockholm recent weeks probably seen people wearing them. Swedish Public Health Agency currently instructions face masks used safe way, virus spread feared.

- plenty online, (World Health Organization noted) organizations excellent such, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. 

The WHO's website contains several instructional videos illustrations use face masks. Speaker voice captions English. search requires googling - English. 

- difficult find considering posting WHO's instructions. primarily aimed traveling, think important get good information use face masks good way, says Anders Tegnell. 

WHO's instructions consist mostly pictures therefore language obstacle, says. 

One Monday July, observe two people face masks central Stockholm. move one city's larger streets bank premises. walk entrance, lift face masks place chins. man meets helps number tag. sit table. 

When couple's turn, go counter bank clerk protected plexiglass. One puts forearm counter hangs whole body furniture get help. Mouth nose exposed. face mask remains chin. make mistakes. 

- story hear often even countries lot information, use face masks incorrectly. part reason great hesitation using it. Swedes others stupid, experience shows difficult right way. 

During spring, posters urging people keep distance wash hands dressed public digital rooms, private places common areas. Preschoolers learned become accustomed scrubbing hands thirty seconds. 

**Why also teach people use face masks properly?**

- Good question. Keeping distance washing hands much easier handling face mask. 
Anders Tegnell maintains focus fact distance people important thing avoid spread infection. face mask, risk increases person wearing crosses limit. 

**But use face mask itself?**

- sure handle time get virus hands. want mouth protection, good information online, certainly refer soon. We've known beginning untrue. Hence informed people point fauci strange habit incorrect. people crazy topic. Like foaming mouth screaming family members crazy. kinda sad. shit sherlock   set sort safety net care ""Recovered"" people sometime next years. never reached 80. Canada enters chat  don‚Äôt know whether nobody natural immunity Covid. evidence suggests 80% people may sort T-Cell resistance coronavirus. Whether resistance causes asymptomatic cases unknown.

What exactly clarifying? matters flu indeed spread asymptomatically. logic, wear mask times throughout year, due possibility may unknowingly harbor sort transmissible illness. thousands people fought world war 2 country, hoping get shred pieces incoming artillery shell. thousands brave souls fought dirty trenches world war 1 country, hoping breathe cloud mustard gas suffocate death. protect yourself, people around country, wear piece fabric face you‚Äôre still complaining? entitled, selfish stupid exactly? Let‚Äôs say, sake (let‚Äôs not) argument, masks -completely- ineffective. What‚Äôs worst could happen? You‚Äôve wearing piece cloth face, it‚Äôs understanding (at least) save neighbor‚Äôs life. carelessness complete disregard human lives baffling me, especially considering it‚Äôs become statement wear one point. 
‚ÄúI forgot mask‚Äù definitely excuse either. going since start year much world.
To may concern: aren‚Äôt unfairly drafted unjust war. aren‚Äôt subjected government funded mind control experiment. aren‚Äôt victim [insert literally anything even remotely unfair]. You‚Äôre merely asked wear piece cloth face help neighbor‚Äîand importantly neighbor. People paying attention, remember fact foolhardy careless person time care mattered. access testing everyone else. hear places affiliated hospitals quick try go drugstore, CVS type deal, literally take two weeks get results back. think lot states struggling unfortunately. 

We ask parents get kids tested come back showing sort symptoms parents report contact someone positive Covid test, happened couple times already..luckily positive cases yet. Please quote said that.

It implied said evidence protests ""big spreader covid.""

Protests big spreader Covid, we're told never gather large groups. Protests larges groups people standing close proximity other.

So protesters okay large groups people not? guy asking. far come back ""lol"". there's silver lining entire pandemic, hope cautious workplace. Treating employees properly sick pay time beneficial everyone. one bit different. clear point even mild asymptomatic cases left massive long-term damages. Stop focusing fatalities. think Disney enough protocols place it‚Äôs relatively safe. safe non-essential recreation suppose. Probably lot safer Walmart shopping. 

But yeah, wouldn‚Äôt go now. love Disney world enough pay thousands limited kind weird dystopian version. However article pretty good job getting people still want go. 

We planning big trip next summer it‚Äôs scrapped point. I‚Äôm waiting return degree normalcy knows be. thousands people fought world war 2 country, hoping get shred pieces incoming artillery shell. thousands brave souls fought dirty trenches world war 1 country, hoping breathe cloud mustard gas suffocate death. protect yourself, people around country, wear piece fabric face you‚Äôre still complaining? entitled, selfish stupid exactly? know. New Zealand, sure. Iceland too, I've heard. even gonna mention 4 people shot title smh. Also lots people go work sick send kids school sick. unlikely happen year, least large scale don‚Äôt know ‚Äúwe‚Äù there. people wanting schools open also think it‚Äôs bad idea bars open. True, even ""Mild"" cases get hit hard, even end ICU. heard many stories called ""Mild"" cases saying worst sickness ever had, worse flu. fucking mask dog-shit-for-brain-anti-masker idiot! know aware this, everyone 'completely quarantined' would fucking world war society would collapse, ridiculous suggestion. People go outside, precautions exist. every passenger boards get D.A.F. sticker?

Yeah, pretty sure he's wrong here. far hole gone past point ""fuck it""? caused lot mayhem, whether intended not. blood hands. n ice job merica. let hem know bout r ight n umbers? maybe hey c hange heir mind. g ive try Iran thousands unofficial/unreported cases weeks prior elections late February. Officially, first case diagnosed February 19. new information shows 52 people already died covid January 22 February 19. severity pandemic hushed due concerns turnout elections.

Official numbers‚Äô reliability range. would say Iran‚Äôs extreme case overt underreporting, coupled getting slammed virus early pandemic, legit lack testing too. real death count supposedly 3 x higher reported. Like US, Brazil frankly, everywhere, many thousands cases untested, undiagnosed apparently often asymptomatic prior higher-availability testing. 

US underreporting far honest reliable data places like Iran, releases demographically implausible data every day. China also omits true magnitude outbreak country, Wuhan/Hubei specifically, people died untested, probably plurality true death count. places, officials pressured underreport cases political reasons. Really hope doesn‚Äôt start happen certain areas United States...   NYC shithole expensive too. Smells like pee summer matter go top fucking overpriced crap city. read edits above, sure notifies not. important things learn lol add point, NFL players life long health issues playing, players health care coverage leave league. PE teacher hs played couple seasons Lions, said became teacher school district healthcare coverage absurdly expensive. kind surreal see somebody played game highest level, years later, become teacher needed medicine. 

Damn good PE teacher/coach though. here. would kick much ass hard time beliving deaths low. believe actually. death numbers go like 1,600 500 24 hours? seems unlikely even drugging alcoholing still feel like lost something like 50% focus significant amount memory power due pandemic. brain mind feels incredibly sluggish. 

I believe I've covid may profound depression resulting this.  Republicans salivating thought public school teachers dying children education. much easier indoctrinate children right wing conspiracy bs theyre uneducated. curfew actually help? joke?  trolling right?  I'm wife one. Shame anyone shouting masks social distancing infringing freedom, that's important guy's life. lives. Yep, fuck them. TLDR :

Yeah, pathway dealing clear back then. I'm quite sure, Fauci saying recently, USs response pandemic would least effective. Truth is, underwhelming pathetic pile corpses embarassingly grotesquely high smell across Atlantic. Isn‚Äôt plan something like give money corporations ultra wealthy? testing sites shut down. still reported 30k tests. Even extrapolating numbers full figure trend still down. many going hard reset?

My brother EMT get hear truth hospitals look like. forgetting nfl pension insurance get? 

Have looked many mandatory virtually unavoidable fees expenses players every year? Even assuming **every** young-20's player incredibly financially responsible never going teammates eating away facilities, reasonable player going sit back chill season serious careers. Personal trainers and/or equipment, medical maintenance/treatment, exact living expenses anyone would have. Except pro-athletes exactly going living super frugally trying live $20 week less food like fresh college trying make shoes last couple years springing new pair. 

To actually address point pensions, vesting term recently reduced 3 years, still disqualifies almost half players seeing average career lasts 3.3 years. relatively small amount given put in. mention fact one stopping working another job NFLcareer majority people NFL college degree already puts ahead many. 

Have read post-NFL landscape looks like vast majority NFL players league years? little transferable skills zero work experience outside football. college degree puts ahead many? disagree HARD there. hollow 'student-athlete' degrees carry weight whatsoever. Someone go college would several years decade's worth experience working misc. jobs late-20's NFL player league 3-4 years 0 work experience 'real world' supposed ahead degree 'earned' generic athlete's major \~5 years 3million jump point 3-5 years college debt puts miles ahead average person. 

Someone makes 3 mil 3 years (roughly averages cited career earnings length respectively) taking home \~$1.8 mil taxes team/league fees. state income tax, majority players, looking closer $1.6 mil career earnings post-tax zero consideration towards sort living expenses whatsoever. 

Is better average person? Absolutely, argument there. write initial comment try convince random people internet pro athletes exact working class folk. know what? average Redditor arguably either. Using example, fortune going school scholarship minimal debt majoring field pays well. I'm nowhere near disgustingly rich never life. Maybe define 'true working class', sure hell dismissing opinion due income somehow made news one day calling CEOs completely disregarding safety. comes health hundreds NFL players, people get arms they're 'all rich anyways' even though statistics show average player even bringing 2 million income time league. distance league owners/execs virtually (if greater than) distance us CEOs companies work for, even 'better off' average person.

Besides limits certain post. experimenting this. algorithm seems limit certain topics. care. People eventually find truth not. dont live forever.

Well one now, might well get fancy it. butter knife swiss army knife fanciest get I'm exactly position. finally got chronic fatigue mess, covid I've fallen back wormhole. struggle get bed.  Interesting math problem. 
Given particular death rate, percentage population knows someone died. 
Let‚Äôs simplify condition assume equal distribution ‚Äúknowing‚Äù, though highly unlikely, humans infections operate clusters, topography social relationships another whole field math, we‚Äôre simple math here. 
Dunbar‚Äôs Number considered upper end many people human maintain close relations with, upper limit 250. 

We‚Äôll also assume 250 negligible fraction total population simplify calculations.  

It‚Äôs easier calculate probability don‚Äôt know someone died 
The equation is: 

(Chance knowing someone died) = (1-Death rate)^(How many people know) 
IE odds every one know alive

Let‚Äôs turn into: 
p  = (1 ‚Äì r)^D


For Texas 
r = 7,500 / 30,000,0000
r = 0.000250

p = (1 -0.00025) ^250

p = 0.939405722

So there‚Äôs 93.94% chance don‚Äôt know someone died. 

1 ‚Äì 0.939405722 = 0.060594278

#So there‚Äôs roughly 6.06% chance someone Texas knows someone died. 

If work backwards 50% Texans knowing someone died. 
.5 = (1- D)^250 
.5 ^1/250 = 1 ‚Äì 
0.997231251 = 1 ‚Äì 
D = 0.002768749

So roughly 0.27% die. 
Which population 30,000,000 83,062 

Indirectly though, near certainty someone Texas knows someone else lost close relation.

(1-0.060594278)^250 = 0.000000163

Thanks! think younger, healthier population + large percentage single households + high trust authorities (comparatively, least) + socially distant culture begin driving factors anything. countries fit bill, strategy *could* work, would one countries.

Sweden didn‚Äôt mandate many restrictions, still advised many restrictions countries, high compliance among citizens overall. One study based mobile data showed Swedish citizens moving around much Americans lockdown (so probably combination low compliance Americans, high compliance Swedes guess).

The trust health authorities Sweden unlike see US countries. means voluntary measures better chance working country like Sweden (whether long run debate). would never chance place like US instance, rampant science medical denialism fierce mistrust authorities. 

Other countries also older high numbers smokers, like Spain Italy, others exceptionally unhealthy reasons, like US. three countries also far multigenerational homes cultural customs other‚Äôs personal space large degree.

The socially distant culture high percentage single households Sweden means significantly less opportunity spread general.

The relatively good health Swede‚Äôs means contract it, it‚Äôs far less likely severe (or ever even tested).

And trust authorities means reasonable percentage population following guidelines voluntarily.

AND 2020 isn‚Äôt even yet. What‚Äôs apology Trump going now? Even China proven origin expect apology them, what's going well? Nothing.

I understand less test Florida Isaiah, something else play like lower number tests run ?

I would rather hope US reached peak, least wave.. It‚Äôs little nuanced Australia right now. 6 8 states territories effectively eliminated virus, 1 got close (NSW) one explosion cases past months - largely driven incorrect quarantining returned overseas travellers. 

Now one state VIC potentially driving states infections - borders around country closed try prevent larger outbreaks. 

It noted though VIC gone stage 4 lockdown highest number cases 700 day (for city 5 million). effectively cases reported country. 

So VIC hard lockdown next 6 weeks (at least) states hoping stamp outbreaks occur (some travel states allowed). 

It‚Äôs winter Australia well, hopefully weather warms VIC locks reach state community transfer country. fuck? not? Everywhere else does. That‚Äôs lunacy. poetic. based income wealth.

The silent courteous, people feel comfortable unsafe ridiculous ""beliefs.""  anti-maskers shooting... sounds absurd believe it. per capita new case rates rural counties nuts. Counties 10,000 20,000 people rates bad worse cities peak. people seems like would try make bad. 15,000 people Jefferson County Florida. nearly double average new case rate Miami-Dade County (2.7 million people) last 7 days. hear total numbers relatively low. joke hypothetical. epidemiologists see borne data time time again.


This scenario schools reopen:

* family three children go three separate schools within district: grade school, middle school, high school.
* middle school child acquires virus another student brings home two siblings acquire virus. However, none showing symptoms.
* three go back school next days spread virus three different locations.
* high school child spreads virus friend parent works another school district process repeats completely new location.


It take several days first person starts show symptoms decides get tested. point hundreds contact points multiple locations affected. entire school districts shutting down.

Now mitigation tactics like reduced class sizes wearing face masks might get lucky minimize inevitable spread. However, schools opening none tactics. Sorry alchohol bleach kills it, basic virology.  Literally US Secretary Education, Betsy DeVos. times group people cannot take care life kicks asses. use new tools survive throughout time go away. Ignorance dependency lead major sufferings. cannot hardest lessons learn kid gloves come off. would rather vaccine kills 33% people take disease kills daughter finally called shit asked got numbers said dont know, heard somewhere.

So know low .06 comes someone know pulled shit, using .03 number citing CDC. numbers different, I'll use today's numbers example:

Total Cases: 4,649,102
Total Deaths: 154,471

So people know enough ""divide small number big number"" get .032, enough turn percentage multiplying 100 get 3.2% death rate. 

Now, .06 specifically came from, know (older numbers, different country, state county specific) seeing "".03%, .05% death rate"" posts, people fucking stupid half math problem. true vaccinated well? think correct. people‚Äôs worldview foreign seems rational seems completely insane you. Online education doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúdumb‚Äù. bit extremist. mean, we're kinda dumbasses already, major loss long last much longer. Employ people help...

But would rational efficient - would ever want thing /s. Wonder anyone poisoned going overboard disinfecting groceries?

These antimaskers peaked womb Saying *""They might also become cancer-proof long term. again, might not.""* proving genuine researching subject repeating hear.

In reality know, exactly how. Science takes time again, trying ridicule situation proving value hate research discussion...

There tens articles research subject really keep saying Obama would've listened scientists would've kept covid entering US much less becoming widespread. Yet fact remains literally every single country planet outbreak. Every last one them. world leaders listening scientists? called excuse called statistic. need. ammo anti-science nutjobs.  pulling numbers internet butt. need lie. I'd love see source could find ‚ÄúThey literally gained nothing,‚Äù said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow Peterson Institute International Economics Washington. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self-inflicted wound, economic there's still large portion people aged 20-50 

What % think ""too large portion""? 50%? 20%? 10%? 1%?

I'm seriously asking. Honestly, instead making kids teachers staff taking chin here, maybe employers bit flexible realize there‚Äôs pandemic going things effected one wants are.
I‚Äôm fortunate keep kids home many families aren‚Äôt able like ok kids teachers fuck you! went dentist gave sticker number indicating passed temperature check. course forgot take off.

So walked out, stopped convenience store, took bus home mask neon sticker numbers it... one said anything bet thought incredibly ill. really though, bc people covid get again. Theres guarantee become immune. Privatized prisons?  Here's wishing family best  making shit up?

If charge data claim are, provide proof.

Resorting nonsense playground response evidence cannot back point know wrong. states (mostly ones spiking) starting see ""weekend catch-up"" still taking place Wednesday now. 7-day average pretty much use anymore there's consistency reporting timely manner. Gov. Kemp wants pat back Trump. üòäüòäüòäüòä going hurt women? Even so, AZ going end flat tail vs steep drop lockdown countries, needlessly killing thousands perpetuating supressed economic activity months could avoided. sure, pat back. really large amount flu cases fall. rate transmission easily less 1 covid measures place. much less international travel, flu strains community. that's reasonable argument made. think acceptable *last resort* means creating distance working. get could send kids school right now. kids start school soon they're going school. There's way hell, dead fucken body. Wake fuckup. Sorry failed appreciate ham handed satire abusing dog No, implication virus going crash economy anyway. People aren‚Äôt going behave like nothing going on.

The way save economy stop every becoming widespread. would required competent national response actual shutdown, half-asses one country did. happen rationale masks protect others. disagree. I'm merely countering argument way way matter right now.

Somewhere middle paths take address concerns level another. really want argue reason covid became established US current administration incompetent? That's asinine argument light fact became established every single country planet. There's single country outbreak. And, stated previously, infections low country handled cases responsibly. Unlike response covid-19. factually true.

They low disease less virulent. Plain simple. reason SARs never became global pandemic. I'm sure argue countries around world handled SARS perfectly suddently became incompetent covid came around. False. And, stated previously, low country handled cases responsibly. Unlike response covid-19. factually true.

Thank agreeing me. According article, two people caught ebola US healthcare workers caring someone caught ebola W. Africa. That's it. Every American caught ebola caught W. Africa. one caught US. nothing better response administration. everything fact hospitals quarantined people diagnosed R0 ebola high. pandemic; ""established"" U.S., per comment. Scientifically, cannot otherwise conflated SARS1 SARS2. And, respectfully, mistake, mine.

And I'll ask since said administrations responded better, lockdown shutdown quarantine order previous administration issue deal swine flu? major sports shut it? restaurants nationwide lock doors it? happen? didn't. Pays well???? don‚Äôt think so. Teachers grossly underpaid. Maybe, pays better cashier benefits, pays well quite overstatement. information obviously different per location, already teacher shortage. past year even pull district employees fill classroom spots. Surveyed district 50% teachers high risk live someone is. swarm teachers ready step 50% step down. aren‚Äôt even enough fill positions already have. many deaths? activity supposed safe environment. Big groups cannot happen. one talking lunch time masks impossible? anyone boast safety impossible.
Out door classes ....nonsense areas much rain, bugs, cold, extreme heat. thing give change everything live. virus going away. Things big world changers...and 1918 H1N1....so completely different virus cannot compared. comparison humanity learn history top 2 big threats world. virus fragile BS interdependent system is. communal anything means domino effect....which pretty stupid think would never collapse. Self responsibility complete independence way. Opinions matter. Reality teach every last living person be. I‚Äôve found spray much easily wipes. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve actually able buy wipes since February going end predictably.

And nothing else, tiny little lethal virus, none us see, exposed house cards US truly is. Everything rely hinged together, hanging single thread. one goes, crumbles.

America NEEDS functional social safety system, NEEDS national living wage, NEEDS single payer health care, NEEDS nationally instituted paid-sick leave, NEEDS affordable child care assistance. things play together make functional society works everyone. mish-mash independent personal responsibility states rights bullshit killing us (in ways one).

Argh. Sure. need under-educated, over-privileged population place make Trump happen first place. think even means?

You complaining data manipulated administration control way imply read social media, think sheep?

The ignorance astounding. Ecuador _far_ worse shape official numbers would suggest. government open fact testing capabilities weak best.

Fortunately options. Well since can‚Äôt see ‚Äúschool essential‚Äù useless comment doesn‚Äôt address concerns presented, amount discussion could possibly get understand. again, prove Fauci right, opposite.  Profit: noun, financial gain, especially difference amount earned amount spent buying, operating, producing something

Profit strange word use context (usually profit something business owner makes, employee) go it, someone working cruise ship isn‚Äôt making much ‚Äúprofit‚Äù. Profit would left paying expenses. It‚Äôs like people cruise ships making $200k money burn. They, like vast majority people, probably little left pay covering expenses. literally choice employed given living costs money need job get money. job suggest instead? Especially world unemployment service sector sky high. 

Your argument like arguing teenager takes order McDonalds somehow fault America‚Äôs obesity epidemic needs job pay school. Both.

Majority ER visits critical.  people going be. 
It's bad lot hospitals Illinois furloughing doctors, cutting hours outright closing.

Mercy hospital Chicago received large amount patients ER. shutting.  can't ride storm Masks mandatory age 7 up. Distancing practiced classroom space allowed, classrooms small 6ft distance. rooms ventilated. hotter days June, 30-35 degrees C (90-100F), masks allowed off, time raised bit outrage.

However except notorious incidents, major outbreaks occur schools. Alongside schools, event venues prayer houses also opened, appears major outbreaks occur there. ‚ÄúAlarming alarms‚Äù? almost actual exponential growth pandemic. mathematical sense anyhow (the term sometimes used synonym ""fast"").

I

The main findings elevated troponin decreased cardiac output (heart pump less blood squeeze), lot people saying troponin means people heart attacks, simply true. worked surgery, people elevated troponin surgery half time, shows body stressed. think troponin explained muscle inflammation alone.

I'm less sure cardiac output. severe cases, decreased cardiac output lead heart failure, I'm reading research correctly bad. control group (people never Covid) showed decrease output well, looks like healthy control group output low end normal, Covid group output low end normal, difference small enough would expect end heart failure even problem persists.

Also keep mind small sample 100 people, researchers emphasized concluded form research need research. issues may well turn exaggerated bigger study, happens research time.

My dumb fucking aunt posted Facebook saying ""what would rather vaccine kills 33% people take disease kills .06?""

Her daughter finally called shit asked got numbers said dont know, heard somewhere. 

What fuck wrong people? scary relatives stupid people, highly intelligent, brainwashed. nothing wrong conservative thinking everything marxism global pandemic fucking much, thats spin they've spoon fed eat shit up. ‚ÄúIncorrect quarantining‚Äù

Yes, sex quarantined people going home spread virus probably ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way lmao Freedom important guys life. didn‚Äôt even realize existed 5 seconds ago. said, wear fucking mask. Japan actually considers US handling well.

Grow dude. heard one side story. kind seem way....but little older, sometimes wonder generation running country years.....but sure grandparents appalled generation. worked covid-19 since pandemic broke out, experience rarely talk infection causes death, writes doctor Benjamin Kalischer Wellander.

The misconception mortality covid-19 exaggerated undermined health service's work informing risks, warrant review. Swedish authorities several independent measures estimate number deaths, agree other. official bill therefore reliable.

A tenacious myth covid-19 great uncertainty dies ""with"" ""of"" disease. notion statistics exaggerated including died natural causes spread least Donald Trump's supporters, also reached Sweden. Many probably seen show spread links comments social media. Often picture drawn official death toll much overestimated.

Even established journalists, example Emanuel Karlsten, influenced misconception post website July 9. Expressen since July 11 chosen quote Karlsten's conclusion - Sweden counts ""dead covid-19, "". implies actual death toll less official one.

As doctor, however, find easy understand statistics exaggerated. working covid-19 since pandemic broke out, experience rarely talk infection causes death. Sweden also several ways estimating death rates, means measurement problems handled reliably.

The Public Health Agency's official count shows many died within 30 days tested positive covid-19, thus quite rightly includes number people die covid-19 reasons. However, problem limited - risk accidentally testing positive covid-19 belonging small proportion population would passed away within month regardless, simply low.

Even nursing homes, positive test means eight times increased risk dying within month. end 2019, approximately 79,000 people older 70 years lived nursing homes, according National Board Health Welfare. January April 2020, 11,000 people died nursing homes. Assuming number newcomers period equal, monthly average death risk approximately 4.1 percent individual (the number deaths, 11,000, total number enrolled, 90,000, divided three (the period three risk dying positive covid-19 test nursing home approximately 33 percent, according report presented L√§kartidningen June 26. Logically, death toll hardly driven fact elderly would soon died infected. 

That official figure exaggerated also clarified measures, cause death certificates. These, unlike death certificates establish deaths, overall clinical assessments cause death issued responsible doctors. According cause death certificates, sent National Board Health Welfare, number deaths 20 July 2020 amounts 5,500. almost many number deaths within 30 days positive test (5678 20 July 2020 according Swedish Public Health Agency), since doctors three weeks send certificates, number may adjusted significantly. fact number deaths according cause death certificates likely greater official count, indicates official death toll rather low.

For who, odds, still cannot convinced, another measure: total excess mortality, shows many people die pandemic corresponding period pandemic. According Swedish Public Health Agency's report, almost 6,000 people died pandemic corresponding period last year, even slightly higher number deaths laboratory-confirmed covid-19, time writing 5,600 people. died natural causes, excess mortality rate would great pandemic.

In total, three separate measures mortality, source error one measure, would revealed others. contrary, observe convincing consensus, kills claim victims die ""with, of"" covid-19.

**Benjamin Kalischer Wellander** , ST doctor internal medicine work psych facility, employer providing surgical masks stopped staff started comingin cloth masks (and also wear supervisor around). buy PPE. Regarding KN95, strap around head. Also put faith HR Admins taking precautions avoid outbreak. Employers mostly protected liability written protocol place (i.e hygiene theatre). Mo mean, I'd go without kids since amusement park core.

Don't need wear mouse ears dance princesses enjoy riding rollercoasters etc El pais... wsj... 1 england forgot.. oh case... SCIENTIFIC METHOD simple masks protect people around much protect you. bigger sign masculinity taking burden yourself, order protect around you? men even consider argument wearing masks? article nothing rehash state India is. pandemic withstanding. lockdown prohibit people going get food supplies. People also hvae access food able pay. multi-level governmental agencies (federal, state, local) well non-governmental agencies.

With good monsoon year, record level acreage planted many food crops. several orders magnitude worse, gunfights authority figures becoming daily thing, children simply dropping dead streets, alcohol shortages bad people forced siphon fuel, return rule power bad. It‚Äôs emotional, classless thing say Amanda obituary. Also, putting 100% blame people, Dave.

I ate twice, first time pub, downloaded app email address. yesterday went restaurant scanned QR see menu don‚Äôt know means contact future ( don‚Äôt think so, didn‚Äôt give consent so). Sad Republicans Texas fascist they‚Äôre that. Nice work! voucher like saying ""I bothered find gift instead tell buy own"". Giving cash/gift vouchers equally lazy least cash allows freedom spend it. get cash multiple people put together something bigger, separate vouchers necessarily allow that.

I *have* given voucher gifts store 100% know person like. Otherwise cash inside card. Many things got called wrongly.. proof.... 

Now what? applies people planet. Ah yes, another social movement institutionalized racism dies crumbs symbolism thrown plebs. Amazing, history cyclical. local peaks COVID, nice give people room. knew clean was. talking ventilate 4 patients time, needs clean room?

On note, best situation hospital would intubated something covid related. likely viral/bacterial filter beginning ventilator circuit humid air exchange HEPA filter end endotracheal tube. you‚Äôre getting cleanest air anyone.  Toronto, Canada, masks mandatory indoors public spaces, physical distance rules apply everywhere, think almost everyone obey mask rule, go grocery shopping maybe 1-2 person wearing mask entire supermarket. opened indoor dining gyms days ago, increased indoors gathering limit 50 outdoors gathering limit 100, long maintain distancing. think number people breaking indoor gathering rules distancing cluster cases province blamed house parties. also allowed establish friend/family bubble 10 people drop physical distancing rules within bubble. 150,000+ people dead virus control US. exactly want people act? holding 2020 anyone

Oh trust me... idiot will. understand wide world outside US ? dozens countries 'big pharma' holds sway, health systems much poorer- would absolutely love use cheap drug like Hydro. 

They using, stopped using it, shown effective COVID. Sad true.. thought purpose lifetimes grow change mentally evolve?

I guess them, that‚Äôs case... soo brutal... right, lots know yet. frustrating far pandemic. feel way yearly flu season? Yes COVID much deadly flu still kills thousands yearly. agree. thought Covid-19 would ONE time people pulled together agreed way us protect secure future. no, contaminated politics, people stupid/ignorant take precautions, fuckwits want rebel establishment.

Humans never ever learn.  So... think speak New Jerseyans... Yeah.. know her. affiliate her. suck fat one care.  cases numbers are, expected, already going down

This happens every time someone corrects post incorrect information make incorrect prediction. shift focus something else.

I addressed incorrect claim ""**we see significant increase deaths either Texas Florida,**"" immediately shift focus number active cases.

Yes, case numbers -- there's drop US whole roughly 60,000 new cases day 'only' 48,000 new cases day, decrease 9% -- though people know acknowledge [**the numbers active cases probably 10 times 

You present misdirect way (with nod original thread's title) someone watching forest fire active 400,000 acres would say ""look, firefighters managed contain fire one hill there. Things looking up!""

Back numbers fraction New York's 

If look data: [**New York Coronavirus Map Case see New York hit peak April 13 weekly average 978 deaths (scroll page 'New reported deaths day New York' mouse graph). 

If read link: [**Florida breaks weekly coronavirus death toll record 1,000 reported know Florida reported weekly death toll 1,230. **That 126% New York's death toll peak city's crisis**. Yes, fraction, though way mean, since 125/100 th New York's cases. overflow predicted come pass

Too many factual counterexamples list, few:

[**Over 40 Florida hospitals max ICU capacity Covid-19 cases surge across hospitals running drugs, beds, ventilators even Hospitals Overwhelmed Virus notice redditors like engage another tactic here: keep setting goalposts back. First, 'ICUs always work ***close to*** capacity.' Then, ICUs filled up, set goalposts back. Now, suddenly, hospitals 'overflowing.' hospitals overflowing, find another high-water mark, new one, demand that, unless -- know -- field hospitals major cities -- outbreak control bad 'doomers' claiming is.

You also address fact [**US healthcare workers burned flu season right around corner. feel sorry child too.. nose covered what's point wearing mask??

If happen cough, least mitigated mask. Basically better-than-nothing ordeal. said before..i say again... average IQ people lag catching onto things, harder time letting go...they think 1 (delayed well) change enough lifetime anyone recording actual arrest? wanna see smug face getting arrested. hear acne kid!

/s aye.... they'd need learn aim. Looking timeline alone, almost guarantee someone got hospital spread remaining members family. 

Probably someone wears mask work required calls ‚Äúthe election infection‚Äù ‚Äúthe Chinese Flu‚Äù (or whatever non-scientific spin put it) soon scrubs come off. Probably someone believes masks make sick. 

But remember, someone coughed hallway walk hallway 5m later, could theoretically get infected then. Anti-maskers needs put down. cruise people recovered virus would okay. Tell getting Sept getting next Jan maybe matter live dead lot people. Treatments getting better every days. That's try slow spread.

Why hard people understand Novel virus? blame life California

Those seem unrelated lmfao Lmfao office really, really busy. slow days May first reopened, it‚Äôs full tilt since then. anecdotal. Look, I'm encouraging people wear masks public places sanitize hands social distance, fact virus, going spread, people going catch it. Unless wear hazmat suit hermetically seal like bubble boy, going risk.

I get lady grieving everyone different ways can't hold people deal things little irrationally. angry lost someone, looking someone blame. egging on.   Friday (7 dead), Sunday (5 dead), Monday (5 dead)...   
This worst weekend 2 months. wish they'd announce stay-at-home orders already.   
(All I've heard far ""bars restaurants requested reduce hours business."") - can't even call *""band-aid""*    
   
After first 'stay-at-home' orders ended, everyone seems think 'Well, guess worst over.' numbers say probably going bad week Japan.    
(Stay safe, wash hands soap (20+seconds), wear mask, people love you) Yep, totally agree this. The‚Äôll angle debt argument first, they‚Äôre pressured enough bet would admit public option wouldn‚Äôt even work sick people private insurance would throw plans gov would pick (they know happen).

All Biden undo changes ACA trump made. wasn‚Äôt quick disregard. Retroactive observational studies (like Ford study) merely point areas warrant study. problem almost always confounding variables. 

Now multiple randomized controlled trials (RCT). Unless methodological issues, supersede observational study.

Not directly mentioned chain, similar situation exists 2005 SARS study people keep referencing vitro. First, wasn‚Äôt sars2 second vivo studies. take precedence vitro. science works. New and/or better information changes current thought. even one RCTs showed positive HCQ maybe would warrant study, right focusing resources elsewhere. Anyone classically educated.

All reference materials world won‚Äôt necessarily teach person think, apply logical principles, critically examine evidence, etc. Alabama Mississippi scrape bottom barrel negative issues. ...why football. basketball, volleyball etc close others understanding Christian theology receive doctorate. right same. want share information it. Yeah, UO sub (I preferred UO Disney), realistic appreciated bounced. disney due karma years price hikes beyond inflation. ""I love uneducated!"" \~ Donald Trump get stupid people realize stupid? First, isnt second wave- still first wave.

Second, realize federal govt send Texas 600 men women military help surge, right? ICUs absolutely overrun. People sent different areas state deal increase population. easy say everything easy peasy youre eating cheetos commenting reddit, actually work(ed) ICUs- pure chaos.

Luckily, Abott shutdown bars restaraunts allowed local authorities mandate masks, many followed. Cases dropping. Proof masks idiotic bars restaurants key slowing spread. 

Still, neglecting 245 deaths sad. can't believe people still downplaying shit. course, theyre numbers you, someone actually seen numbers people dying alone like myself- I'll kindly ask remove head anus take virus seriously. everyone like that, find semblance normal pandemic. I'd probably still cold, though. Tepid, best. blanket statement. real key schools reopening People need start pointing governors placez like TX FL *even Mississippi* mask mandate.

I admit hear backwoods Southern thinking, surprosrd found came Alabama Mississippi... northern Florida. ‚ÄúRisk‚Äù hahaha hahah. Dude... it‚Äôs malignant. 'On real note, patient.' isnt whole point going schools patient?? people worry going school get good job, people like bezos &amp; gates dropping &amp; creating jobs them. üòÇ  class bias invisible unacknowledged public discussion aging too-small prisons. Democrats Progressives would rather talk shorter alternative sentences reduce prison population, direct money feel-good social programs. Republicans even focused fiscal responsibility, governor tried float private prison build supposed retain state control, shot down, money-making prison seeks prisoners. 

It‚Äôs frustrating. really good alternate drug court two cities, every year reapply Federal grant continue State won‚Äôt find money ensure continued existence. 

There‚Äôs still resentment Flatlanders changing Vermont ways, haven‚Äôt heard connection prison problem.  Still 200,000 excess deaths. Fuck snowflake, went post history go spew reactionary nonsense subreddits vegans shit trying ""own"" them. course crying /r/nba too. probably post ""MUH HOAXVID-19"". Fucking cringe. People believe information education....

It‚Äôs part it. Critical thinking big part too.

So socialization. alma mater school district Indiana, school planning 4-week period e-learning. parents showed full effect school board meeting told thought teachers replaceable clutching pearls nothing demanded kids go back school, board killed e-learning. 

So that‚Äôs parents Indiana think children. Yeah, want full time, permanent jobs usual bull shit semester based contracts expire end school year. Wish could trade Trump Merkel, wish anyone, even finsta rings Lagos, Nigeria. don't. There's good chance lot shitty people. could see things getting worse winter. Definitely longer outside.  Honestly see problem 

They live alternate reality, alternate facts got lots people act like ruining discussion realistic situation Respecting religion, giving creation stories equal time school, taking evolution...yep mean? wiping groceries get store bad?
Also shit ""its big deal"" talk. r0 3 high 8. incredibly virulent, family members respiratory problems, immunocompromised. get it, die, come crippled. Yes, studies show damage organs getting coronavirus. rural Miami, Atlanta, Austin, Houston, Dallas...?

I mean...you realize ""rural"" states huge metropolitan centers, right? things don‚Äôt depend one‚Äôs belief lack thereof. Like sickness &amp; death. ever crowded middle school hallway? Relying masks prevent spread like putting forest fire watergun It‚Äôs lot easier socially distance state like WV. combine little tourism isn‚Äôt casino make comparatively safe. could fat zombie, really funny picture Dumb Alive government wants us.    long think schools stay open? Agreed. think got pretty lucky none bad things happened. matter. Trump nothing right continue based ill-informed mercurial fixations.

His personality pathological right. dunno man... there's lot really fucking dumb people country proud somehow dedicated improving stupid. there's videos countries people refusing wear masks raging store management ""they're free"" ""their right"" (which actually isn't) literally endanger whole community. cities countries blindly reopening despite cases deaths rising rapidly many places worst days march/april nyc. people countries spreading idiotic disinformation conspiracy theories masks actually hurt protect you. outside various bubbles sanity country there's sea idiocy rising like oceans hottest year record. understand seeing massive strikes teachers. know from, Europe can't keep windows open winter wanna end MASSIVE electricity bill. suprised pass fund right 9/11 country united. slam dunk. ~~The spread covid-19 in~~ South shows risks anti-intellectualism i'm christian anymore, bizarre anti-materialist learned helplessness propagated. christians reject agency physical world default presumed supernatural solution everything.

Keep mind Cherokee County School District employee die COVID-19 week school decided person classes. actually mentioned board meeting tears, 10 seconds voting unanimously open face face classes. refused require masks students.

Let's try spinning, that's good trick. likely NFL, NBA must go on. get it, close contact sports. thank you. releases. knew difference saying that.
If noticed richest world dropped &amp; didnt listen b.s. You‚Äôre tell me! ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe everything government tells immediately tell you... so... you‚Äôre STUPID!‚Äù far know, yes. someone sent kid school still awaiting test results? IDK man, dumb alive people got us mess first place understand logic dumb people follow Trump death. headline brutal.

I feel bad kid family.

But headline makes seem like hospital, got intubated reason, contracted COVID-19 died. Yes seemed appropriate scenario :-) I‚Äôm process moving. we‚Äôre cusp civil war, don‚Äôt want caught wrong side Mason-Dixon Line. Ice-cubes divide America covid strategy really boils think human life worth. like feel people die bad, sad, least completely shut economy. Others take humanistic stance feel every preventable death tragedy, especially dealing numbers thousands. can't convince either side approach wrong value &amp; belief systems priorities life different. *crickets* Wow, things must really getting dire - anus Deep South whiplashes ""Masks wussies!"" ""Wear mask $500 fine!"" Praying selfishness top bottom.

Parents sending kids school instead fighting safety themselves, families community.

Teachers going schools reopened instead fighting safety themselves, families community.

Schools chose reopen instead fighting safety themselves, families community.

School Boards Districts reopened instead fighting safety themselves, families community.

Governors forcefully reopened forced reopen instead fighting safety themselves, families community

Congress passed unhelpful pittances People instead fighting safety themselves, families community.

The fact single drop feels responsible flood. seems like everyone, every level, waiting someone else something, instead know right difficult.

The buck stop somewhere. stop sometime. better place here? better time now? think need research complications due covid-19.  still understand Alabama, southern states, mask mandate. figured we'd battling Mississippi Louisiana 50th.

I mean, there's still lot people it, see massive increase number people do. Dewine zero spine. Every tues thurs reading map going ""Boy someone really something this!"" Governor Desantis bunch Florida sheriffs attended Florida Sheriffs Association meeting hotel ""took every precaution"" ""exceeded"" social distancing recommendations event required masks, one table per person set 10 feet apart disinfection area every hour.


So governor enact mask laws mandates bunch Florida sheriffs enforce mask laws mandates meeting masks mandated. paid staff tax dollars disenfect every hour.


So there's interest ambition hypocritical leaders. Shocking. Going college isn‚Äôt something proud 2020 lol, enjoy paying $25k year overpaid masterclass There's shit ton young teachers want jobs necessary advice considering beginning pandemic many telling breastfeeding moms cease nursing fully isolate babies. probably destroyed nursing relationships unfortunately.

I'm still nursing 2.5 year old.  probably considering wrapping things pediatrician advised there's better time continue nursing pandemic. are. I've nursing babies 6 straight years boobs old tired, that's thing know now, Reddit. say that. Dear lord reddit jump conclusions. I've never said schools open. thought u everything ur supposed u would fine? Agreed, look Texas‚Äôs numbers.

1,000 COVID deaths daily, state isn‚Äôt testing/reporting deaths/hospitalizations. wealthy tested.

It‚Äôs insane &amp; sad.  favorite post title ever probably mostly splitting responsibilities already underpaid people work places promoting anyone hate you. sounds exactly like ghetto mindset New York. hardly wait see angry truckers storm legislatures. business care liability, asset. Glad least trying apply harm reduction rave. similar note, neighborhood saw pretty sure drug deal... people masks! doubt it, unfortunately really see talked whole ton. still want acknowledge nation preexisting condition. US government deserves lot criticism people also dropped ball one. Asian countries successful people treated like plague want pass families close friends. Family big thing Asia nobody wants lose loved ones. Given science-denying lockdown ‚Äúskeptic,‚Äù I‚Äôm going waste time arguing you. can‚Äôt even read article without lying contents.

Banging head wall would better use time. Yes. anything said comes across I'm still right? admitted right website say that. Here's one: rare though. Also, family took get tested tested negative, false negatives common. Trying find article follows-up autopsy report... probably good state takes virus bit seriously, see photo would never happen. Anyone without mask would immediately scolded. fact majority people photo wearing masks tells serious residents GA taking virus.

Also fact FL GA made masks mandatory yet leave individuals, tells constituents maskers know right. prevent understanding comment. regardless decide spell naive myopic put onus teachers, pledging sort retaliation funding future understand ""essential"" means pandemic. piss off. According CDC 1968 flu killed estimated 100,000 Americans. We've already surpassed Covid-19. can't go back way things were. Schools prepared deal social distancing requirements time. Covid-19 spreading far worse back March closed schools before. want open schools sending kids families grave. Maybe willing make sacrifice. I'm not. Look guy valuing statistics human lives assume record, subway jared covered subway years.|
how people damn unaware Gotta love marines fucking around base spreading around /s no, don‚Äôt understand. USA bad. think USA bad, USA brainwashed *I'm expert*, would think subjects who've signed participate clinical trial made aware either receive drug tested placebo.

Otherwise, looks like would several legal ethical pitfalls. hill want die on? soap kill viruses? find look soap covid soap kills virus.

Here I'll link first 3 link google it. mention rebuilding staff teach kids. already teacher shortage country solution try kill off?

What part even sounds like good idea anyone? Actually meant both. accept it, want expect it. Expecting admitting defeat. statistics looking at? clearly they're right ones. keep trying convince downplay seriousness pandemic? Let's say someone preexisting condition contracted COVID dies week later. Even preexisting condition played significant roll person's death fact COVID direct cause aggravating said condition point death still considered death COVID, COVID person would kept living...

And let's forget fact millions infected never tested. thousands died home yet reported..The numbers looking significant undercut actual numbers infected dead. Sorry burst bubble like that. want interpret numbers without taking facts consideration, making uneducated guesses magically make valid true sense word. there's nothing, excuse, opinion, nothing, change it. go FL.. dont want kid go. sucks.. Thanks link sorry sass. There's many 'SWEDEN BEST' people around data showing better Scandinavian countries extremely lower death rates.

My question would - Denmark economic hit - previous data showed did. less apples apples begin look EU member states - got hit differently literal stop throughs international travelers (they would gotten hit earlier unknowingly). yet people dumber ever So, um, accepting American refugees moment? Asking friend.... Knowledge bomb. Love it.  already fucked Ohio, feel like we're fucked even more. DeWine wimp. Hang there... using per capita statistic? can't that... condescending responses brilliant discussion. Thank you! doesn‚Äôt it, work true. help help educate people importance masks shy asking people wear one socialize even feels awkward. 4) 2022 / 2023 school year? It‚Äôs control thing. Principals etc want employees site ‚Äúwatch‚Äù them. There‚Äôs logical reason it. It‚Äôs stupid. And?

I know rich, buildings such.

15 billion - wow - organization 1,3billion people. Really rich! understand dude's heart might see irony statement. True, may need go school need ""educated"" extent wish ""alive"". Dumb last long. hero. Things okay since left. One day peaks (for cases least) caused backlogs tests processed, necessarily mean people dying. # people dying function # people actually infected/hospitalized, whereas there's bit disconnect # people actually infected # people testing positive, testing backlog.

This use 7 day average, smooths bumps backlog processing. also test positivity % important, lets us calculate big disconnect is, badly need ramp testing sub taken sock puppet denier accounts? highly contagious, means likely kill somebody. That‚Äôs added end couple months may different place... I‚Äôve even heard NYC plenty people without masks. Sorry specific, surprising got downvoted, heaven forbid. Certain states havent forthcoming case numbers either, politically control some. mean, based general population's response thing believe teaching shit schools anyway. sure kids missing much. Good Yes makes naive believe teen well what, months, translate well school year even home learning college. Also naive believe left devices, teens right thing. Sure will, remember like teen. Imagine guidance home 7 hours...I'm going back sleep 730 getting high lunch 17.

But anyway, pretty aggressive post responded to, idk offended tone last post gonna condescending, spell right.
 
Feel free let know spelled incorrectly also led inability comprehend comment. clarify; kids idiots. They're largely made go back school whether want not. 

Their parents, politicians way chain main issue. DeSantis won‚Äôt get it. Stop reaching. He‚Äôs soulless robot. Schools south typically begin earlier, first week August normal teachers returning end July. also get earlier May northern schools, balances out. I'm fucking tired hearing school reopening. God damn reopen mofos get with. feel like talking 3 months already. Yes! people complain coworkers employees take time take care sick kids. Sometimes it‚Äôs people complain kids spreading colds flu also complain people taking time work. can‚Äôt ways.

Some people seem think right never inconvenienced anybody else‚Äôs needs. Guess what- there‚Äôs right, That's covered poor people. expect see show numbers? school district forcing educators show work campus right now, Arizona, type this.

The superintendent talk walk. That‚Äôs applicable grades 1-6 one teacher subjects (also, it‚Äôs air room different days/groups students. Kids coming second half week breathe air students first half week).

Students grade 6 different teachers different subjects, also specials go different classrooms for. Meaning they‚Äôre breathing air, also passing hallway, know won‚Äôt take distancing seriously. 

Starting early taking longer break may district level thing, don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs state wide (though, haven‚Äôt researched this, could wrong). still wash hands? Pffffft..... believe massive drop offs, tbh. I've actually seen uptick pediatric ER ICUs. People showing doorstep guns that. I'm sure ""good guys guns"". Georgia masks ironic oxymoron? committed felony assault minor hint bioterrorism. 

Smart man. opposite issue. Many local businesses nightmares non-compliance, get supplies couple towns businesses I'm going harassed assaulted wearing mask. could local businesses back day, there's lot places feel bad closing up.  I'm shit. Florida, Texas California basically middle first wave, Sweden approximately late March/early April. count 11 states higher death rates Sweden right now. hard time believing number won‚Äôt rise things going right parts US. It‚Äôs funny conservatives dismiss RCTs show benefit zinc wasn‚Äôt used, they‚Äôll cite several non-RCT studies (like Henry Ford one) also didn‚Äôt use zinc proof works. zinc required, studies must flawed showed benefit without use zinc. needs write book. that's true many nurses working either likely likely it. I'm saying that's right what's likely reality I'm going list literally every single person lot! one positive may come pandemic may increase adoption rate annual flu vaccine generation. anti-vaxxers gain total control government. gonna condescending, spell right. Canada says ‚Äúhold beer watch this‚Äù opens bars.   Punny user name!  find multi-faceted war one front relates defeating virus.
 
We facing economic issues, food insecurity issues, education issues, housing issues, etc..
 
Your myopic view naive. Man businesses going hurt real bad Ireland. shut long. No. 

Here‚Äôs logic doesn‚Äôt hold up. There‚Äôs risk every single thing do, every single day. Sickness disease biological fact life. Every time you‚Äôve left house you‚Äôve susceptible disease. Extending past that, risk daily life. Driving car, getting boat plane even crossing street brings risk. say ‚Äúwah wah car accidents aren‚Äôt contagious‚Äù, yes actually; contagious. Accidents happen outside control time. 
 
If say need live completely risk free time live total isolation outside physical world that‚Äôs human beings want live. no, even serologists CDC given guidelines outside isolation risks getting sick universal continuation life society whole needs considered well. virus blow population without vaccine matter do. unless plan living inside house forever always outside interaction, isolation worth certain point.

This particular virus ranges bad cold deadly, personally fall deadly category need isolating. one infect home. need public that‚Äôs mask mandate makes sense. household needs take personal risks consideration. understand. :/ Nope. Taxes means money collected government. services government provides different category thing. Also, taxes tied government mandated law. cable service something *chosen* subscribe canceled whenever want - unless actively gave option signing contract says otherwise. Also, cable privately owned operated service way associated government. *cannot* reasonably compare refusing pay taxes doesn‚Äôt make go away; whereas, refusing pay cable bill almost always result it‚Äôs going away. truly feel medical profession, time it‚Äôs signed for. sign social distance/mask wearing/symptoms monitor. Maybe covid specifically, nurses doctors literally signed work people infectious diseases. also (should anyway although understand many hospitals running resources.) access effective PPE ability enforce strict safety guidelines. 
The jobs mentioned cannot compared teaching, none require employee bachelors/masters degree job. None jobs require small room doors locked windows closed 25 children 7 hours day haven‚Äôt even mastered covering cough sneeze. None jobs require employee hide corner room, wall, huddled together practice hiding active shooter. None jobs require deal 25 children playing cough-cough covid tag, using mask sling shot, hugging everyone, putting everything mouths. nanny maybe closest brought up? nannies like 1-3 kids family nanny practicing social distancing wearing masks etc. nanny hours isn‚Äôt anymore risky another person live home socially distance you.  customers blame employees make salary deem low employees blame think earn much? type fucked reasoning that.

At salary someone become responsible actions, opinion? could raise money much worthwhile things organization hoards billions (in cash) begging hand outs.

Also, maybe they'd local parishes they'd stop pay millions child sex abuse scandals year damn year. 

It need damn money. Give people actually need it. Trajectory one aspect, reducing foolish. Florida trending Ohio trending up, things still much worse Florida.  Bruh what

Police officers literally interact public random day. That's stupidest policy imagine. Soap works well anyone without access rubbing alcohol dump everything tub soapy water minute. Anything can't go dumped another container bag. barf  Jeez, wonder people let go idea miracle cure?

Also, taxes tied government mandated law. cable service something *chosen* subscribe canceled whenever want - unless actively gave option signing contract says otherwise.

While may 1st degree contacts died, many us know someone lost someone know, among 2nd degree contacts.

I think nobody played Six Degrees Kevin Bacon game. delayed getting info world late December early January (WHO noted outbreak Jan 5). December regional officials suppressed information everyone including national officials

**I'm sorry Italy, Spain France known virus that. bother notify WHO?**.

This Professor Fabian Cohen said regarding early cases COVID-19 worried since November 2019, already knew risk epidemic protect elderly suspicious right money. France's earliest case December 2 2019, earlier China's earliest days. Michel Schmitt said man hospitalized December 2 ""respiratory infection"" confirmed COVID-19. 57-year-old man, currently good health. unknown became infected. taking data account, confirmed case, according also able find suspected cases dating back November 16 2019, though still needs confirmed. doctor team recently analyzed 2,456 CT scans, carried November 1, 2019 April 30 2020. Result? 16 CT scans showed ""typical COVID-19"" profiles November December, first two cases November 16 17. case dating December 2 ""is confirmed, data taken account,"" says Michel Schmitt France Info. Earlier cases still need Italy, doctors suspicious weird pneumonia cases approaching end last year. Dr. Adriano Decarli mentioned following suspicious pneumonia cases Northern Decarli, epidemiologist medical statistics professor University Milan, said ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù increase number people hospitalized pneumonia flu areas Milan Lodi October December last told Reuters could give exact figures ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù people usual taken hospital last three months 2019 areas - two Lombardy‚Äôs worst hit cities - pneumonia flu-like symptoms, again, right money, virus confirmed already circulating within Northern Italian community since last year. National Institute Health (ISS) said water Milan Turin showed genetic virus traces 18 Decarli, Dr. Remuzzi, Dr. Cohen, others European medical community already suspicious weird cases since last year, yet none bothered notify W.H.O. 

But seen lot people pushing #ItalyLiedPeopleDied, #FranceLiedPeopleDied, No, course not. that's science works. 

""Needing time investigate"" ""covering dangerous virus"".

**US intelligence nofied NATO Israel November**. notify WTO? briefed November** anything? country starting sentence reeks agenda. imagine kids could vote parents parents let eat ice cream dinner. 

Reminds one South Park episode kids call CPS parents letting way whole child society devolves ""Lord Flies"" scenario. teacher I‚Äôm tempted ask superintendent financial incentives driving district open person. city corrupt enough extra funds could probably would end lining higher ups pockets. Disgusting. always wished could go Disney enjoy little people. know Disneyland packed sucks spend 8 hours go 4 rides total lol fucking lunatic.

I'm sorry go this.

Also make post audio recording, people see kind lunatic is. Maybe listen someone spends time online talking wrestling. work backwards original claim ie 100% people knowing someone lost life, calculation give death rate 0%

I know enough math know means though. Depends definition means ""know"" someone. someone know (a co-worker, example) loses parent, may know parent, 2nd degree contact, definitely feel social effects loss. incredibly sad. 6% good enough me. high chance. dugout, locker room, traveling cities, hotels... think baseball problem, everything goes along playing it. ""Known parts world"", clinically studied yet. FHM already conducting studies spread comparisons countries(esp. neighbours), see Finland Sweden concering school closure example, though guess fit preconceived ideas regarding xenophobia.


If look numbers, seem 'thousands deaths' ahead, numbers coming steadily. fact, pretty much statistical models regarding deaths Sweden waaay off.  Plus Hep C - it‚Äôs 4D chess! completely understand isnt popular take (hence 250 downvotes), reply merely u/napoleon_tha_god asked question. seen 2 different comedians bring thing incorporate one bits, alone thinking that. become widely accepted say R.I.P. anytime hear someone dont know passed away, never going convince anyone otherwise get shamed so. Plus isnt really great look story someones death bring sort negativity. become like natural courtesy response way smiling saying hi someone walk make eye contact with. Id willing bet nobody Nagy family reading online reddit article, kind like mentioned odds high u/canton1009 doesnt truly care RIP comments seen nagy family, otherwise would make effort seek facebook page go fund page obituary page newspaper send condolences way. right, ‚Äúhey dont forget me‚Äù way getting extra likes believe way one comedians put joke. 

I say one good thing see come RIP reply threads pop ALWAYs least one person share story someone family passed away thing person article passed away from. might also ‚Äúlets make me‚Äù moment some, seems coping mechanism majority people getting chest. way look now, helps people cope loss family, ok trying ‚Äúvirtue signal people much you‚Äôre pretending care them‚Äù first deaths Vietnam recorded 31st July, barely week. vast majority recent new cases deaths moment related 3 hospitals city Danang, indicates cross infection. 

Most fatalities elderly patients Department Nephrology, Hospital Danang expect many among may make anyway. Nevertheless, doctors nurses still trying best save lives costs. Yes, thesis made correctly. wasn‚Äôt something fishy going it.


They found politicians paid others write thesis, (if remember correctly) fakes datasets gathered support thesis.


If that, sure, someone find take away PhD. ‚Äúonly‚Äù went crazy recently thesis done correctly, nobody anything it. passed test time.


Unfortunate? Sure People large social networks days. count 2nd degree contacts (friends friends, family members coworkers, etc), unbelievable lot people ""know"" someone died. permeates government, it‚Äôs called kakistocracy.

Congratulations, USA, England, Australia, Brazil, Turkey, Israel, Phillipines... remember kid aids blowing even allowed use public bathrooms longest time everyone washing hands like crazy even allowed swim hotel swimming pools seriously know going people's minds thinking wearing mask infringing personal freedom. 

They might well think paying bills/taxes told work bosses daily basis infringing ""rights"" well.  vaccine given get ill. What's matter guys?  definitely both. ""I woke going wear masks give freedoms go bar mall fake flu!""

Its arrogance, stupidity selfish entitlement rolled package overall idiocy. wonder also way scared people feel kind control situation exercising delusional denialist thinking.

From tell people believe everything post youtube, instagram twitter says sadly great majority people society today.

 Bunch sheep ironically think independant thinkers totally disregarding scientific fact, logic critical thinking following idiot social media says. Funny, people descend like pack savage dogs, trying make righteous.

Keep speaking mind. Reject urge make opinions tasteless ""safe."" finally understand saying within context. Damn.  well kinda think valid question asked ages. Every time see someone write RIP F. Trying show compassion decency time type words? srsly? Especially ppl never really met barely watched movie something. like share image food instagram. casually. don¬¥t know appropriate.

Also one assumptions wrong words said dead ones saying well others still alive/survive. rather insult better explained important distinction really think minimum live experience order prepare need information.

But since rather decided insult him, nothing better made be. 

Sad lol Selfish people must take lead death toll know several 2nd degree contacts died (friends friends, parents co-workers, etc). far 1st degree contacts. 

But take long time compassion effect make difference place like Texas. There's much indication strains different enough immunity one cover others. See, that‚Äôs you‚Äôre taught school. American values using natural abilities working ass achieve something better. elementary school whole warped education America welcoming melting pot oppressed elsewhere build better life grit determination needed reach new world. 

But add prosperity gospel already money considered favored god you‚Äôve got really fucked duality rising also condemning moral failing. Add smidgeon slavery ass backward ideas proliferating country

But that‚Äôs minority country. vocal one, still minority Exactly creates high demand capitalist society. Companies make mask like crazy. get bad, hope doesn‚Äôt ruin reputation lake ozarks. It‚Äôs great place usually. 25 still much. zero. That's scientists estimate year advance strains going dominant flu virus mutates fast unlike COVID.

So, flu bad comparison. people believe major conspiracy going on, see hoax nothing change mind.

How expect people anything protect others think entire thing organized ""elite"" control everyone?

Then also people think wearing mask giving freedom. complain wear seatbelt? (I hope don't). even breath/talk around you. cough/sneeze.

A lot people ""Spit-Talkers"" ... years years they've acted like big deal throw spit talk, around tend give telling swallow crap start talking... know several people I'm around constantly feel random droplets hit me, fucking annoying normal times.

Now ""Spit-Talkers"" around talking without mask enough. wish effective since mom takes lupus. Would nice know protection. I'm surprised someone shot tbh Seems like Texas working it. studies ongoing: would say based studies, likelihood positive outcome low. Human body naturally store zinc, seems unlikely zinc help. Though scientists taking chances might work. I've known people hospitalized. guess trust story online rather reality surrounding me. Age covariate here. You‚Äôre statistically far less likely experience serious symptoms younger are. Even fox reporting excess death number. DEy nuber dey gud dey bad lizes think gf pulling like 20 miles walking per day average per day staying D-World per Fitbit. literally never tired life great. wonder it‚Äôs even selfishness. pandemic deniers seem like mindless dolts me. Lol heard fellow redditor looked up. Seems accurate mask, real gateway drug.... Good job keeping cool guy. üëç

I would told fuck verbally. Seriously, Fuck people like him. ignorance FAR beyond repair. Nah, bred selfish fools. realistic one.   still beat though. Forget it, arguing antivaxer wish schools something like this. sisters school completely forgot them, would weekly zoom meeting 15 mins. instruction, nothing packets homework. semster ended college took teaching looking forward tbh. know send kind control. conspiracy theorist, although enjoy debunking them. 

Masks somewhat effective distance, yet people driving solo cars walking open air one around wearing masks.

It easy get American public buy masks vilify wear them. easy would something else? Mandatory vaccines, tracking chips? Tracking software phones already thing. Almost nobody Texas best, though. Mask usage low, people wear masks, good portion wear around chins. continue attend crowded events act like nothing changed. confirm. Currently living piece shit high-rise building consisting approximately:

65% low-class minorities

35% trashy Kens Karens bought apartments retirement

The low-class people necessarily bad intentions, ignorant fuck. wear masks, touch mask rub eyes, face, etc. remove masks upon entering lobby common areas think ""I'm home now, mask off."" think they're taking precautions, reality.

The Kens Karens hand know exactly they're doing. I'm aiming get fuck soon possible. don‚Äôt expect England survive. expect break apart Heptarchy like days old hope get worst it. Well everything days, sports fans, movie lovers, restaurant people, golfers, art lovers, mountain climbers, literally name ton different hobbies revolve around big corporation even several big corporations Well that's one 100. Teachers staff. every school least one dies. Take pick. lunch lady? old janitor remembers kids? bus driver? kindergarten teacher? many choose from! America defeated acting like huge fucking baby. Depression disenchantment modern society already kill productivity.

I can't imagine I'd get anything done add chronic fatigue mix.  Ty, looks like full breakthrough, still think keeping healthy good idea though. Worse, people Texas going crowded places droves, like pandemic.

And go out, people respecting personal space. went local store buy basics yesterday. dude, wearing mask, nearly walks I'm standing waiting pay. Instead moving stands stares me, glare back (without saying anything). shouts ""Well fucking rude"" right face. 

It's fucking shitshow TX. one reasons job health insurance. That‚Äôs good one, hadn‚Äôt heard one. work housekeeping hospital unbelievable dangerous there. Weve always understaffed safety hazard. timed every cleaning area have. Especially turning around time cleaning patient discharged, moved ICU die. managers pushing us ti go faster knowing full well can't sanitize properly time we're given. Even normal circumstances, pushed rush busier, harassed dont go faster even though pandemic. refuse compromise safety. told "" trash dash"" ( empty trash cans clean sanitize) area pregnant women treated. told manager unbelievable asking endanger pregnant women. never asked filed incident report union. However, filed repeated reports many, many violations I'm brushed "" one knew going pandemic"". Really??? 6 months still staffed following regulations? someone loved go hospital, would carry bleach wipes PPE keep safe. saw Florida Texas, state health departments corrupted political agendas. conspiracy theory. We're actively lied multiple levels govt multiple ways. called crank magnetism keeps acting way saw Florida Texas, state health departments corrupted political agendas. conspiracy theory. We're actively lied multiple levels govt multiple ways. Everybody sacrificing money lives. Money comes back. Thanks puts perspective. It‚Äôs saying god bless you, you‚Äôre welcome, thank you, etc. It‚Äôs cordiality guess. It‚Äôs way us humans express sympathy respectful towards one another.

You got dumb fuck? child raising family US 1% afford teacher bubbles ignorant breeders aspirations life procreation.

Who else would propagate conditions? think Denmark taking average 2 weeks Norway taking running mean end two weeks something, 100% sure. remember article trying explain criteria results difference two countries. anonymous internet, someone getting emotional worked reddit reply genuine unless knew person really looked - us know person, understand pain family go through.

A chain ""F""s probably greatest posthumous honor someone get anonymous social media.

Look recent funeral John Lewis. Indoors, large gathering, wearing masks. Yet Joe schmo wants outdoor funeral 10 people illegal.
A car show fair that's outdoors illegal yet protest OK.

# Covid study illegal according ethics committee

Researchers Uppsala University sampled 450 people antibody tests high-profile pilot study. study lacked ethical permit Board Appeal ethical review reported case prosecution.

It two separate reports [Board Appeal Ethical Review study led professor Uppsala University conducted violation Ethical Review Act.

The board reported case Public Prosecutor's Office.

In April, responsible researcher staff took blood samples 450 friends acquaintances study prevalence antibodies extent spread new coronavirus.

The sampling took place meeting room tenant-owner association, leftover test material previous, completed, study.

The compilation test results - showed different degrees spread infection different parts Stockholm - communicated media reported Public Health Agency.

But research thus lacked ethical state.

\- pilot study, ie testing fingertip blood approved test among friends acquaintances, ethical permit needed, responsible researcher said May Upsala Nya Tidning.

However, Board Appeal states research subject permit requirement Ethical Review Act, since blood sampling constitutes physical intervention research person may performed approved ethical review. also means research also complied law's provisions information researchers requirements consent - prerequisite research project approved.

According committee, fact researchers subsequently received ethical approval major study irrelevant. fact test subjects acquaintances relatives give rise assessment.

The Board Appeal finds procedure may entailed risk spread covid-19 among researchers residents tenant-owner association. ruled sampling strategy led illness.

In addition, procedure may undermine public confidence future research, according board. Yes. love everyone pretending like going make it. three failed organs. That's one every two years. rate 30 would 60 organ transplants. Great, especially since it‚Äôs already existent drug. Hopefully manufacture many gets approved numbers trending less cases. There's lot conspiracy theorists sub act like downward trend due something else, truth virus, least wave it, starting burn out. mean another wave Fall, wave 1 starting burn out.  I'm sure definitely will, possible need assume much now. sister law went Florida last month sweet sixteen last week I'm like actual fuck entitled little shit Glad works guy, would rather dead bald. **A high-profile pilot study, researchers Uppsala University tested 450 people antibodies covid-19 tenant-owner association's meeting room, reported Public Prosecutor's Office.**

The research study reported prosecution Board Appeal Ethical Review, states study conducted violation Ethical Review Act. results study reported Swedish Public Health Agency communicated media, writes , first report report.

The study, would show presence antibodies proportion test subjects ill covid-19, lacked ethical condition.¬†

**The researchers sampled than** 450 friends acquaintances. sampling took place meeting room tenant-owner association carried test material left another, already completed, study.

When researcher led project, works Uppsala University, talked study earlier, said require ethical permit.¬†

But Board Appeal believes does. Taking blood sample physical intervention research person, may done study undergone ethical test approved. also means research violated regulations information researchers requirements consent, prerequisite study approved.¬†

**The procedure study** may also entailed risk spreading covid-19, among participated study tenant-owner association, according Appeals Board, also believes procedure may undermine public confidence future research.¬†

In summary, board considers research conducted without required ethical review permit, violation Ethics Review Act. Board therefore pursuant Section 35, third paragraph Ethical Review Act, duty report case prosecution, ""reads .

The researcher led study want comment indictment, says Pernilla Bj√∂rk, communications manager Uppsala University.¬†

\- thinks good properly investigated. researchers work area, kind thing never fun, unfortunate happens, says Pernilla Bj√∂rk.¬† Fast food happened birthplace Nazism. Wtf expect, Greenpeace there? They‚Äôre going phases. Healthcare workers, high risk patients like immunocompromised, elderly, pregnant people, general public. mean, make excuse want, never data support claims. Tell fingering. votes disagree. again, bottom heart:

FUCK SPOKKER!!!

also tf says dumbhead? state Project Catapult supposed allow 30,000 tests day end last month, 60,000 day end month?

Now, there's demand, there's demand. searching asymptomatic spread community front-line workers. Everyone lava Trump fire replace Dr. Oz Dr.Phil Yeah.... considering small number states responded well see single centralized power would fix this. cultural political problem, issue way government structured.

We'd run bigger risk nothing everywhere rather let smarter states right thing. can't explain everything comment?? happened reddit, great place Maybe gets it, complications....


....or sees difficult quarantine away young family

he take much seriously

Many people regrets got it, gave loved one  I'm afraid may panic closures well. 

This big problem. School going unexpectedly close, leaves parents bad position since necessarily arrangements child care. entire argument defense disparities.

I took position bad.

They took side argument.

Which traditionally arguments work. Minors easier keep isolated. dont provide real responsibilities. children would think parents forced children stay inside isolated. Nobody hides kids flu season like that. source Sun (UK), tabloid often unreliable stories. wouldn‚Äôt believe this.

Edit: googling name, found multiple credible sources escape China, claiming China lying knew virus, manufactured lab. Sadly, many schools still gators. little publicized issue significantly impacts many Louisiana families. 

They simply stubborn leave. We've asked nicely even offered favorite snacks raw chicken marshmallows, budge. 

Every child get snatched recess crowded hall, there's much do. tell kids avoid eye contact (nothing sets gator like getting mean mugged middle schooler) wear bright colors. 

There talks using crawfish somehow stymie gator occupation schools, best coexist. suppose definitely recommended risk-mitigation point view. unless gets outside extended period time unless rabid animal somehow gets *inside*, suddenly develop rabies no-where.

I would rank need rabies vaccine inside cat well risk exposing going enclosed area people. Also, I‚Äôm sure antibody test great indicator resistance/immunity/past infection.

Someone needs figure test cell resistance cost efficient way. America, still better Africa. High goals setting.  guy likes dictatorships!

Russia one several countries might enjoy. highly suggest consider moving. Try Walmart pick up! Also stop shop brands added pick $3 fee. put groceries right trunk, contact, markup. I‚Äôm rich either, trust me. That‚Äôs absolutely thought would go down.

So incredibly fucking selfish. kidding. rolled gave government ability whatever wanted long wanted. would give up? best interest keep fear virus going.

I'm sure they'll accept lifelong crippling side effects part job too! say, make wealthy pay fair share taxes cash invest programs? want accurate idea happen Fall dense population areas isn‚Äôt large seroprevalence level look states listed.

In Texas, Florida, CA temperatures 95-105 degrees July - August people spend much time indoors. It‚Äôs simply hot outside long periods time.

Fortunately dense population areas already large first waves. Hopefully keep numbers lower. americans brown? teachers die help retirement plan? love all! ain't slick. pay comeback comebacks 2020. Maybe rude unfairly

What crazy talk?! I‚Äôm young lived it, someone studied pretty deeply many overarching similarities despite different transmission patterns. One stood right away need urgent action beginning pandemic, warnings scientists ignored government, general hesitancy take dramatic measures ended costing countless lives. time frame different, problems similar. you‚Äôre intimately familiar history might realize much lost due delays. used think people must reacted quickly appropriately, far truth issue pandemics much lost refuse act aggressively early on.

Then attitude people risk disease. older gay friends telling exact mentality seeing now. idea could manage risk right kind people, inability accept reality it, assumption fun youth nonnegotiable. couple know taken responding every dumb excuse hear ‚Äúsaid every gay man 1983‚Äù they‚Äôve seen before. 

Yes, took appropriate precautions could reduce risk zero, still, 500,000 people died US alone. infected information spread known science, disease known extremely high mortality rate treatments. deaths could prevented better leadership, public policy, individual choices (although failure education meant many idea risking).

I wish people familiar history, far tell people extremely well prepared start. really lot learn could helped us (X) Doubt Apparently don‚Äôt swim dawn dusk that‚Äôs time make ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù So, go again.

Shutting testing 400 miles never expected weak storm could potentially impact? That's flimsy excuse administration already known actively working hamstring testing efforts artificially keep numbers down. also true overwhelming majority Republicans also support mask mandates. media highlights people don't, convince public whole party. elected government officials pander fringe listen vast majority Republicans want mandatory masks. disconnect incredibly frustrating.

Very misleading... maybe use year obviously hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúkilling coronavirus‚Äù long false negative result gives data all, delayed PCR negative result also gives data all.. tells negative days ago, idea negative right now. country world sees ""locking vaccine"" viable exit strategy.

Of course not. vaccine exit strategy, there's lot ways go easing lockdowns restrictions allow economic activity. requires good public adherence health protocols, aggressive testing, tracking containment. least USA, important remember companies benefit lockdowns (ie Amazon) ones benefit businesses open.

Long term I'm sure **any** company benefits lockdowns, aggressively contract economy diminish disposable income. Amazon might weather storm better than, say, airlines, mean prefer return normalcy.  What? Science data analytics show sending students back class massively spread Covid result teacher parent deaths. That‚Äôs classy.

Wait... joke? Bring students back class? Nice. suppose nothing classy students class, eh? moment least 

Yeah, point better US. dont know long term ramifications lot things. mean avoid them. Yes, US protects US interests, Europe US military ally, stable US also European interest. direct evidence covid-19 causes mental health issues direct cause increase mental health problems lockdown period? you? Otherwise speculating well. Incredibly hypocritical. 

The fact calling suggesting maybe forced social isolation massive recession might playing part rise mental health problems revealing insecurity inability accept might wrong something. insecurity palpable. explain I'm wrong instead getting offended. 

PS: creepy af bringing ""my posts"" today. Get life outside reddit. Yes, lies throughout whole video. tons debunks there--not there's conspiracy her, making bad faith arguments arrive faulty conclusions. 

Here's one debunk mean, gives peace mind, means it. I've read, transmission via fomites understood researchers [very early studies claimed virus could survive surfaces two days longer based real-world conditions (For example, impossibly high concentration virus used). researcher linked believes would need make contact fomite within 1-2 hours virus still active.

But again....I'm definitely tell anyone they're wrong taking extra steps. Redundancy key component safety. cyberpunk future care take dine in? even help economy theoretically, dine in?

sad. 


I would hate cause families deaths - even accidental intentional like that. China indeed authoritarian tries suppress information reflects badly them. delayed getting info world late December early January (WHO noted outbreak Jan 5). December regional officials suppressed information everyone including national officials. 

On hand -- SARS-COV-2 already spread Europe mid-December; Chinese sequence virus shared results mid-January allowing researchers worldwide begin development therapeutics vaccines. 

Some governments acted early aggressively avoiding spread almost entirely (e.g. Taiwan). Maybe USA shut CDC office Wuhan late 2019 would better prepared.

There's hint original animal source might bats Vietnam. say one knows yet origins story likely take years get definitive answers. Pointing fingers productive unless leads better job controlling spread virus right now. predict death decent certainty ? Or, excess deaths C-19 deaths know studies accounted zinc levels? I'm curious method action theory increasing intracellular zinc, zinc levels adequate? I‚Äôm genuinely astounded lack reading comprehension skills.

The bond contract enter bondsperson. You, affect, say ""hey bondsperson, court wants pay $x, bout pay *you* 10% promise *you* run"". Behind scenes, bondsperson actually paying full bail court, counting getting back show trial.

Now, scat show up, bondsperson that's remainder bail amount. That's majority bounty hunters hired bondspeople, rather actual court. court already *has* money. run, get keep forfeit. bondsperson, though, huge chunk change... take kindly that. prototypical example arrogantly ignorant dooming us all.

Look try cheap shit, like painting kind Facebook-fed conspiracy theorist. ""Big Pharma Conspiracy"" capital letters. bunch companies trying make money. Maybe invest pharma companies know little work behind scenes, terribly terribly naive believe bend facts profit.

There's less evidence Remdesivir helping HCQ, somehow Remdesivir officially sponsored government available almost every US hospital $3K 5 day course even approved. Funny, huh?

I get want pretend tho. going stir crazy would hope so, doubts ""I bothered look science understand wearing mask works, boy confident wrong"" - random reddit dude skipped Texas gears... keep R0 high possible maximize economy without totally overwhelming hospitals.

 But, ""overwhelming hospitals"" means different things talk actual heath workers deal this. Abbott, means 0 ICU beds available... somewhere state. Why? someone threatening needle full HIV, would say same? think appreciating much difference commercial bail bondsmen make system. US Philippines places world commercial bail bondsmen allowed operate. cases, person hires bail bondsman pay bail them, bondsman gets nonrefundable fee.

So, pretty interesting cash bail supposed set reasonable amount based defendant's circumstances, bail refunded defendant shows court appearances, still reason many people feel compelled pay someone nonrefundable fee cover refundable bail them.

There have, incidentally, controversies bail bondsmen found colluding judges setting high cash bail amounts.

Also, countries simply use up-front posting cash bail primary method bail. set cash bail often penalty upon breaking terms release.  matter victim infected not.  intent infect her. absolutely attempted murder. 100% won‚Äôt go jail , especially gofundme takes communication masks terrible start. can't believe still know masks help late game. people means so, equitable, point discussion.

However, store manager wears chin strap various customers mask on. did, falling nose. Predicting course virus really difficult, medical professionals predicting case numbers pretty darned well. leadership actually *listened* professionals saying. Idk I'm youngish way see HD deserves crash burn. tired Regan 80s let brand connected worst people country (I could wrong understanding HD culture lot racism bigotry) decades seems. 

On another note unless something changes recreation vehicle companies probably fucked. millennial 40k student loans trying scrape afford house/family gonna spend 10k+ toy. looks genZ going even fuck financially Wtf u literally untrue. even get information? respiratory disease spread droplets. mask infected person keeps droplets spreading, mask uninfected stops residual risk masks 100% foolproof also encourages people touch face. Literally fucking elementary school stuff. instead dragging knuckles around drooling getting medical knowledge Facebook mom groups actually listen people much much qualified tell masks effective. There's much evidence masks help even know could think otherwise Arizona able close lid tight it‚Äôs outbreak. Cases hospitalizations dropping weeks. able without locking economy down. something consider dealing future outbreaks. happened mom lot worked Yankee Candle. policy accept returns, matter what.

So people would burn 60-hour candle 57 hours bring nearly completely empty jar full refund saying ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like smell.‚Äù Yeah it‚Äôs really not. It‚Äôs logical ask """"The blame death deaths innocent people, falls Trump, Abbott politicians take pandemic seriously concerned popularity votes lives,"" Nagy wrote. ""Also blame many ignorant, self centered selfish people refused follow advice medical professionals, believing 'right' wear mask important killing innocent people.""¬†""  *Hulk.jpg*

Thats secret, I'm always anxious. I've exact thought now. Asymptomatic presumably extends temperature, could contagious show increased temperature, defeating temperature check. much wanted wrong tool help spot contagious individuals, I'm still glad people falling hype.

Not temperature check useless, mind - people idiot enough wear masks, seems obvious people still try go public even showing obvious symptoms infection, machines would spot cases (assuming worked accurately measure temperature, article questions). people don‚Äôt even want vaccine It‚Äôs Florida- technically stand ground laws side votes mean people downvote kind opinion humans like person need put down. would bother trying *change mind* grown ass adult willingly something could kill people think mask political. 

I really don‚Äôt care anymore find way turn humans fuel grind people it. JFC know thing is, talks like everything right restrictive social life acting like she‚Äôs hunkered whole time, reality uses work social excuse hanging co-workers jobs bar close masks recently throwing caution wind bringing people home. Yet still acts like others careless. Starting think might bit sociopathic tbh. would anyone even want come house? Covid? dense... I‚Äôve seen one friend two occasions since February, wore masks outside back porch time masked protest.. feeling like I‚Äôm wasting time even trying proactive since doesn‚Äôt care, yet I‚Äôll remain vigilant moms sake. Wish would same. honestly hope moves stop putting mom risk everyday. Recession based GDP, stock prices. There's way disprove me. 

They don‚Äôt to, burden proof you, one making absurd claim. üññüò∑ Taiwan definitely SARS mind responding Covid-19. Learning past mistakes, significant stockpile immediately started working Germany fabric used N95 masks. understand literally flew people Germany ensure order filled.

Regarding freedom speech, it‚Äôs definite trade-off. Legally means government isn‚Äôt allowed stop doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt get banned online platforms, kicked places (a store restaurant discriminate speech public park can‚Äôt). extreme situations, free speech still lead getting ass kicked.

Free speech important it‚Äôs basis upon criticize government police. call bad behavior without fear arrested. qualify speech allowed isn‚Äôt, immediately create marker others try move order suit needs.

Some speech still protected. accuse someone theft, proof, might sue slander. Even opening causes problems. results new anti-slapp laws people can‚Äôt sue keep quiet.

Anecdotally, swastika thing isn‚Äôt much problem. guy town holding nazi sign. short time learned safety may jeopardy continued actions. Even though engaged protected free speech, assault would illegal, police may interested finding assailant; jury might interested prosecuting assailant.

Some neighbors outraged worried children would see it. saw opportunity remind children terrible time history; opportunity remind remain vigilant ensure never happens again.

Ultimately think approach free speech good harm but, admittedly, haven‚Äôt compared similarly-open countries.

Edit: think you‚Äôre right. Ultimately it‚Äôs used shock. Society doesn‚Äôt tolerate it, though.

You also right proximity. 20 years ago, Taiwan saw knives swastika. shocked friend said Taiwanese perspective bad Germany Germany didn‚Äôt go Asia. perspective, WW2 100% Japan.

I haven‚Äôt seen anything like since (though haven‚Äôt looked it), hopefully something that‚Äôs better understood now. try careful cultures since it‚Äôs hard impress values importance culture without seeming judgmental. Hopefully, educated Taiwanese friend enough able spread message. masks mostly useless.

I hope people also understand replacement physical distancing. Okay, understand. really talking foster kids bounced around. talking kids suddenly unexpectedly lost families Covid nowhere go. 

Hmm. writing sentence, occurs me, make difference kid needs foster care. Kids need help. help them. store policy allows it, people take advantage it. That's logic need.

Even worse [add fact stereotype threat stressor short long term negative health black man America means stereotyped criminal potential criminal, one deadliest stereotype threats always exist under. can't wait lap tears I'm traveling they're stuck home. Probably made worse, unless doctors gave minimal dose shut up. came say thing. can‚Äôt believe numbers today based upon current trends.

Why people upvote fact-checking ?? Really also depends part US from. past months relief (I'm tri-state area). first months terrible things significantly got better. course, US whole strong infected state given strict borders, things always get worse people travel around. True, would it. Ok plague walker. sit 4.7 million cases. Good job. Tonga Toast ü•∞ nah, slight trend. gonna better fall I'm sure. Yeah talking long? Well no, go prison pulled gun fired people told wear mask. following day fired police traffic stop. part wearing mask contributing going prison. part story alone makes hate woman much. kind person thinks ""return"" item keeping it? That's return works!!!!  don‚Äôt think tell you. company, long employees say social distanced and/or wore mask outside individual work areas time prior testing positive, employees notified. I've read research younger generations prefer brick mortar online shopping. Personally, unless im buying name brand know I'm getting hate gambling quality things ordered online. You‚Äôre literally spreading misinformation pretending scientist order reach misinformation. You‚Äôre reason sub state is, people like reason sub going get quarantined. 

Just stop. How‚Äôs guess? That‚Äôs always goal. Yes! lack hope sad. need embracing positives happen. opt drinking bullshit fear firehose tells everyone get putting repeat day long.

You know, 30% US so. think makes sense see Kellyanne grifter. $$$$ be. Many candidate vaccines showing positive results. 

I'm pretty sure we'll see vaccine fall, distribution early 2021. trick disagreement someone something like this, really make sure discussions go circles take long time.

## Highlights

‚Ä¢

A relationship infecting dose risk disease severity demonstrated COVID-19.

‚Ä¢

We report three clusters COVID-19 Madrid, infected persons experienced different disease severity according distinct sizes viral inoculum.

‚Ä¢

Smaller viral inoculi result wide social distancing would contribute lower pathogenicity recent SARS-CoV-2 infections.

## Abstract

A relationship infecting dose risk disease severity demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, report three clusters individuals potentially exposed distinct inoculum Madrid. Overall group developed divergent clinical forms COVID-19. data support greater viral inoculum time SARS-CoV-2 exposure might determine higher risk severe COVID-19. fired. six clusters coronavirus mutations, different presentations body- one vaccine would cover these, six. might need get one shot
Though He‚Äòs right, going 15 0 cases. taking quick detour 2.3 million active cases. I'm aware supply shortages influenza vaccine possible. people want get flu vaccine, that's sure, low level flu vaccination here. Shit Person?   could really use number teachable moments servings humble pie. seems learn things hard way. bad mayor, good riddance. promoting kinds unsafe measures virus spread like wildfire nyc. Apparently 90% attention receive lifetime age 2 years old, technically that's true. 

(I heard QI &amp; ya google comes attention span 2yo studies lol.) cited 4 sided die, knew that. survive virus doesn‚Äôt mean recover it. 20% patients could Ling term ptsd isolated weeks literally fighting breathe. Others serious nice respectful couple months ago. point, people fanned flames, downplayed significance, acted criminal negligence deserve suffer consequences many constituents. Two kids getting sick two kids many getting infected preventable. two kids, take home family, family spread other, vulnerable people. Detroit filled low-income residents, insurance, can't pay treated infected. worth cost, literally figuratively.   Found one article older thought. hopefully improved liberal states now. area hit hard test dead due resource issues. many die home realize sick enough need go hospital.

""In California, one ER doctor works multiple hospitals hard-hit county told BuzzFeed News, ‚Äúthose medical records audited anyone state local level currently people aren‚Äôt even testing people It‚Äôs Many states aren‚Äôt reporting due hurricane fair, ""post covid-19 *outbreak.*""

Could clearer, sure, wrong comment implies.  ""It is."" plan. thought USA. problem sensationalized story glorified tabloid. Particularly becomes patient point.  legitimize going beach ""safe"" activities, naturally occur tangential unsafe activities given sheer volume people going.

Kinda hard say ""stop freaking people going beach"" act like things going happen. Better discourage root cause gathering first place. Yeah live TN beyond shitshow, entire shit circus. Almost one wears masks unless too, schools reopened almost 4 people already gotten infected school, churches jam packed almost safety guidelines. Actually, considering Japanese government failed beginning pandemic, point even Trump seems smart responsible, good example fantastic masks reducing spread virus. Since there‚Äôs limit, lot members hiding pallets, aisle people usually don‚Äôt go (my warehouse usually auto section). We‚Äôve finding loads hidden items like wipes Lysol. People ridiculous lot easy measures low hanging fruit here. Social distancing lot unintended consequences, would mean parties sports events. 

Mask wearing, available hand sanitizer, people stay gone they're sick, even temperature checks really non invasive. Taking seriously friend says kids sick ""but still come over,"" avoiding would probably help bunch. 

Social distancing however quite disruptive daily life events holidays, see anyone influenza. 

Every time say reduce flu using NPIs somebody loses saying ""So want us stay locked houses 6 months rest lives???"" Flu season hot like 6 weeks. Seems pretty easy encourage time, can't enforcement people lose fuckin minds I‚Äôve filling spray bottles rubbing alcohol using could suppress death numbers? 

how? delusional Republican party nearly 50% saying U.S. handled better countries... traveled outside country? hard see successes countries had... Okay apologies upset you. correct lot evidence indicates COVID man-made. enough evidence basically confirm point.

BUT - could still naturally occurring virus escaped lab. example, lab studying different viruses originate bats one scientists workers accidentally contaminated infected, possible started spreading lab. impossible virus made lab, possible lab could virus jumped humans spread started. whether true still big question mark. think mask-less people assholes large % infection rate, infected sick believe antibodies covid. Science &amp; statistics lie. see, thanks Let guess day Biden wins election. No, not. Learning essential, buildings irrelevant. Hell got entire masters degree online. implication?  mean, I‚Äôd saying shit him. least semi honest giving fuck. Shrug

Edit: doesn‚Äôt excuse one bit I‚Äôd rather someone tell straight get fucked rather lie half ass try pretend care. Ha ha. Ingenious! Although purifier charcoal filter, maybe ""measuring"" efficiency filter. Oh I‚Äôve known since 90s. There‚Äôs always myth people would overcome differences common good come together face common foe, idea stomped recent years.

Trump sealed deal sort cohesion... Vietnam got control they're populous extremely poor nation shares porous border China. 

It's clearly doable, need citizenry that's compromised myopic, obese stubborn anti-intellectuals. Employees profiting.

The words meanings, they're fundamentally different. Every fucking time every state sees increase. Why? rise decline similar almost every place?  Maybe wrong choice wording. I'm sure called, grandparents passed, final stop facility pretty pricey. Hell, would lived given choice.

Anyone votes callous, selfish, greedy smuck forced - along - live rest lives repurposed garbage barge.

There absolutely justifiable reason choose man someone suited run country. wouldn‚Äôt even give control aforementioned barge. Even single one many?

He's making Bill vaccine behind closed Gates Billself. Teachers going get sick. Substitute teachers going give hard pass. They'll either close schools bring National Guard stand-in teachers.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, last bit sarcasm.. mostly. high school, kids developed better impulse control, better attention spans know actually study. far perfect good 8 year olds younger struggle pay attention, get bored watching online lecture eventually need adult step help focus them.

I‚Äôm going totally disagree here. 

Going college 10 years ago, students enthralled ‚Äúnewness‚Äù iPhone/smartphone scene largely distracted fact entirety internet 4‚Äù screen pocket. professors didn‚Äôt allow laptops class seen ultimate distraction, especially lower-level classes. Upper-levels weren‚Äôt quite bad, it‚Äôs story. 

Sure students actually bust ass learn, you‚Äôd hard pressed find single student wasn‚Äôt distracted point phone laptop. 

Hell, even professional level, people ‚Äúmultitasking‚Äù work conference calls/video meetings, even executive level. 

I think it‚Äôs safe say general population needs adult step help us pay attention sometimes, included. Lol.

yeah that's realized person learning even hybrid safe. one person gets sick everyone quarantines, feasible. shame, trust people socially responsible seeing far here. went Costco looking wipes today. dice.

I saw nfl guys saying want play, blame bosses thinking people. much fans faults? can't nfl guys play? work dangerous, strike, quit. worth dying over. ""Communist military lab"" definitely sounds like alt-right nonsense me. call everything Communist. moment least, goal flatten curve order overwhelm Healthcare systems. part everyone eventually get vaccination. According reports people get reinfected 2-3 months first infected, means traditional vaccines unlikely work. Additionally shutdowns could cause outbreaks infectious diseases(due lack medical care) tuberculosis. one understand right treatment pandemic longer time frame. best information currently inaction. also deliberate spread misinformation regressive action. literally nothing quite likely would better outcomes, people would figured mask thing earlier demonized. Deaducated dont disagree could lock wave wave basis. Please see post somehow approving US response.

I simply agree message article bought paid special interest groups nationwide lockdown. seems bit conspiratorial me.

This article seems take sensible look long term future pandemic across world. Even locking wave wave basis change truth statement ""this virus stay"". think probably correct.  tough call. way would seen coming... Williamson county, right Nashville. rural.  kids. Lmao. said fuck dude opinion might change people telling hospitalizations trending looking good florida /s That's attempted manslaughter lol  (all?) southern governors. states? missed big one

""Why working parents sacrifice income stay home watch/teach kids""

In ideal world people would able stay home teach children safety, really feasible lot people. outcomes obviously inevitable obviously unlikely others?

Could company see bank account? aware misinformation? Actively malicious? Survivor bias they've managed infections before?

And people got ship? Why?!

Test, quarantine, test MUST travel. Avoid travel can. many school aged kids died corona? 

Also weren‚Äôt schools major outbreak centers shutdown? better treatments. sort legislation mind? Fellow educator also calling bullshit. There‚Äôs way. white rabbit peaks, throw radio bathtub Tuesday, FDA's ""do-not-use list dangerous hand sanitizer products"" includes 114 varieties hand sanitizer avoided may contain methanol, potentially fatal ingredient.

More hand sanitizers also recalled others recommended recall. Methanol toxic substance absorbed skin ingested.

The federal agency says cases, methanol appear product label ""not acceptable ingredient drug, including hand sanitizer, even methanol listed ingredient product label.""

Hand sanitizer apparently poison think I‚Äôll stick conventional hand soap on. going counteract USPS told intentionally delay mail, killing OT, more? He's everything power destroy postal service working. think lot pro sports leagues like MLB, NBA NFL gonna lose lot Dan's next months years. last 5 months people realize dont need going pro sports games watching TV time. pro sports last almost 5 months people already picked hobbies people know sports fans already said arent interested since NBA MLB returned  true. 2 teachers wife‚Äôs school sent home today testing positive. Kids aren‚Äôt even back Wednesday. far, plan hope disappears soon. FOUR months!! least. Likely more. likely 500k deaths minimum. KAREN balls don‚Äôt touch $753 bond? hear speak hahaha! going places. recovered Covid assume there's acquired immunity, right would fantastic time take cruise. /r/Coronavirus Listen man live Florida let tell Jacksonville fucking worst. comes someone lived Tallahassee. talk fact trying return item possession?

That screams entitlement me. Sure, refund get item back us later...  Kind worry maybe happen like No, actually to.

Can't shit show Put dick blender. opinions passing phase 3 4? Really? elaborate? I'm really trying catch early still years researching proactively. Considering amount people I've met internet sub alone it, seem rare say is. NYC overrun cases doesn‚Äôt necessarily make sense, yet... Utah's super easy. moved filled online voter reg, checked receive ballot mail. Get ballot, fill out, mail drop city office building.

I mean postal service every time dropped weeks election day nobody else same. lines. Social distancing would breeze compared actually waiting 5 hours line vote. I‚Äôve got neighbours separated since February one works cruise ship people voluntarily getting them? report highly deadly new virus Kyrgyzstan China said crazy  would literally punch whoever cough intentionally family. mom‚Äôs lungs aren‚Äôt really healthy condition, possible COVID would kill way easier compare healthy adult. Seriously. vote submarine target practice absolutely zero remorse that. absolute worst way spend day Disney parent little kids. Well Florida shut numerous testing sites tropical storm, almost certainly reporting full scope today. Monday.

Nonetheless new cases, hospitalizations, deaths appear trending back nationwide even ignoring today.

And true California storms certainly political ""cook books"" Trump. Holy fuck hot garbage .  PPE = Providing Prison Ejaculate day ends ""y"", it'll lie. fuck people goddamn cruise ship? fuck let cruise ships book passengers? state officials pickle, honestly, bind medical profession telling know would opinion lot people state Mississippi would prefer told, prefer wear mask feel should. 

In words, Mississippi state officials choose listening medical professionals listening electorate. True story Laboratory supplies genuine concern, along masks, PPE, nitrile gloves, etc.

I see issue this. 

Source: I'm former lab analyst work laboratory instrument field service. Many labs find supplies. Yeah able understand parents stupid care kid‚Äôs education. don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs shame. pandemic helped unveil incredibly large number stupid people around.  forget guys, Florida testing sites shut down, good portion Texas damaged last Hurricane. I‚Äôm hopeful that‚Äôs case. cynical side tends think they‚Äôre trying kill everyone prisons. vaccinate high risk people, healthcare workers, teachers

Reality: rich people, rich people, rich people.

Then maybe healthcare workers Haha EDS like that. hope find answers looking for. diagnosed 6 years ago made much progress managing symptoms since Since WH took data ingesting, answer ""**NO**"". We'll need find avenues get accurate, non-pandering information Lots US Canadian sports fans already sucked things. going 5 months without watching sports many people realize dont need pro sports like used know say America first world country, right? except get killed police wants share sourdough recipe? Woosh Yes media biased. fake news propaganda step biased news.

Most people agree main stream medias bad controlled, us still find reliable sources information, claiming wise either lazy ignorant. 

Everybody stumble fake information while, difference certain people put ego side change mind showed new information. unfollow bad unreliable sources information, case disgraced doctor ever using message... Gonna give chance. bought tp America, unlike countries, greater % population dumb blacksmiths anvil. Sorry, that‚Äôs truth. That‚Äôs like ignoring American combat deaths Pacific WWII. Wtf Same! think it'd ridiculous take virus give (potentially) lasting neurological physical damage seriously - apparently live tipsy turvy land ü•¥ Well, Debbie Downer, hard see reopening schools cause explosion new cases parents, grandparents , caretakers.

This whole pandemic feels like we've gambling everything inevitable things happening.

US: Sure happened China can't happen here!

Florida: Sure happened New York can't happen here!

US: Schools reopening done safely cause problem! For, umm..., reasons! people going cruise ships? 10 second Toms. Test case #2, pending execution care? entire conversation unfounded belief vaccine impossible, personal plans future.

but really care personal life, plan get vaccine soon available go business best socially distancing. high risk activities (clubbing, bars, crowded indoor spaces kind) vaccine. lucky me, lifestyle things optional. job performed remotely. already work home freelancer left house times week even quarantine

if stay home I'd probably trying buy full face p100 mask gas mask. might anyway they're useful thing many situations, including hobbies involve noxious chemical fumes

once again, none changes substance argument effects way, I'm curious little game trying play Deaths Aug 3rd pretty much identical previous Monday, even though reported new cases quite bit.

Sunday Monday deaths always seem low reporting (probably based weekend closures), pick rest week. best look 7-day moving averages, day-to-day numbers.

Check graphs daily new cases daily new deaths. see guess you‚Äôre going lie, go big. thousands factors go determining pay, think impossible say 2% big enough margin say even gap. Controlling external factors going leave margin error bigger 2% Imagine defending guy attorney. Well far aware, ""doo-mer"" auto delete comment it. tell previous comment got deleted, is. However, guess ""doomers"" s, isn't? least people Mississippi poor / want experience cultures travel much. truckers worry about. :-p made laugh hard nearly choked!

Is dark grey/almost black stone? so, may slate. Rub food safe mineral oil. Really work scratches. slate get bit darker scratches become less noticeable. let's add anthrax smallpox bingo Florida temporarily shut testing. Definitely sub‚Äôs gonna start pushing again, huh?

I remember sub saying we‚Äôd need gun back March. remember saying one would ever go near world would change forever.

There‚Äôs caution, there‚Äôs fear. Let‚Äôs give fear. anyone tries misconstrue this, wear mask, social distance, stay away people now.

But one going need defend house sprawling gang looking steal tp. giggled. I'll admit it. love good Scooby ending. Right know enough answer kinds questions. lying health issues often pointed one indicator severity least anecdotally I've seeing enough stories fit people lingering problems least I'd say study needed. ex. MLB developed endocarditis sit rest season idea long recovery be.

Initial viral load might one explanation. brief exposure vs extended exposure sometimes make illness severe probably one factor. Plus I'd guess people get exposed winter (there's research demonstrating viral cells stronger cold, heat weakens outer lipid layer) might become seriously ill well. 

The problem novel virus many questions answers.  I‚Äôm dental hygienist sees max 8 patients day, 4 days week, hour each. wear kn-95 day, new surgical mask patient, face shield I‚Äôm actively treatment. wonder risk level is. hope it‚Äôs high, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs higher average person‚Äôs. Karen versus Dr. Fauci manager. 2012 think. run flat. might right non replaced goop inflator stuff. 

I watched tech wipe door jam, peel sticker backer apply new sticker top existing sticker. Maybe little sticker covered psi chart? asked new sticker said extra spare tire info it. 

The whole thing surreal experience. discovering empty storage well, providing couple spare tire options choose (like, know, spare tire-est one guess) reminding I'd probably want rim I'd probably want tire mounted rim... quoting price install spare. like ""Install what? want use it, I'm putting spare tire well."" ""Yessir, install tools wheel secure. know how."" I'm thinking; 'Do know hand tighten single plastic wingnut? Yea got this.'

The dealership guy nice all, I'll never buy car without spare. NHTSA rules, can't believe even allowed.  Hey, went high school. surprised all.  **sophist** specific kind teacher [ancient fifth fourth centuries BC. Many sophists specialized using tools though sophists taught subjects music, athletics mathematics. general, claimed teach (""excellence"" ""virtue"", applied various subject areas), predominantly young statesmen nobility. - Wiki It‚Äôs also anyone could leave town did. I'm surprised cruises still allowed. Fuck em homeless already virus, might good option. supposed bridesmaid. asked 2 years ago. makes problem vaccinate high risk people, healthcare workers, teachers end ""pandemic"" start getting back degree normalcy

The actual concern virus goes away widespread vaccination happens good thing standard *jailed without conviction* ""clearly responsible"". That's fucked. get really riled woman, fair enough, throwing away high standards justice due process stick one person worth it.

Oh fer feck's sake. Dexamethasone even cheaper HCQ used extensively right since medical staff ICUs finding actually helps covid patients. Doctors give damn much one drug costs another works. spend time arrested trial, charges lifted? Still make sense. business owner, get another 2% discount salary expenses, would take lol. fact wage gap self-solving problem.

Working cheaper means get job instead person. China makes things now. SAys dude played watch worth Americans salary. used suggest title button publisher must changed title. Here's screenshot title remains Yes unfortunately.

Some even believe US constitution applies here. $10 HAPPYBUM-X9358V spend $48 (other codes available too). bad deal comes free shipping. supposedly donate 50% profits. understand reviews opposite (either super soft rough tears...)

There's also Covid multisystem inflammatory syndrome children. guess months years suffering ok then? agree white women historically (and currently) guilty keeping people colour down. see meme undermines dynamic good idea would well received me. 

However, experience meme Reddit (I'm social media) &amp; news media I've seen used way. know whether co-opted men (particularly young men), created men co-opted social justice. Either way, become tool subjugate section society also disadvantaged, differently know, italics communicate emphasis nuance.

The italicized post actually *says something different* words without italics would say.

Your post says someone *trying* ""sound real smart there"" other. 

But u/brighterside that's standing front. They‚Äôre logistically inept dealing archaic system. Even wanted well, would virtually impossible. need start getting billionaires actually good help them. Let something useful. Trumps Axios indication admin fucking handle COVID. Except believe even time saying public shouldnt wearing masks specifically needed healthcare workers time.

Once supply regular masks sufficient, learned even homemade cloth masks work decently changed stance.

I dont think anything unscientific it. pretty much perfect policy, US didnt great supply masks like asian countries used wearing time do.

I would say biggest blunder saying ok young people go cruises early march. ultimately said hundred cases US, within weeks things started get control cruises cancelled anyways. Whaaaaat? That's crazy. would've guessed gonna happen? Besides everybody comparing Sweden countries, issue swedish numbers overestimation. They're likely accurate. issue many countries underestimate numbers.

Sweden, neighbors, numbers match excess mortality. Many countries ha much higher excess mortality official Covid19 deaths. I'm remote learning point, unsafe many people, arguing ""even single dead child one many"" impossible line sand us draw even best times. thought positive residents stay nursing homes. That's saying months ago. Abbott, Lee, DeSantis thing criticized?   words.
No words say stupidity. relies police actually enforcing fines. I've read many stories police agencies refusing enforce COVID-related mandates. Like remodeling bathroom even non plague times id wearing respiratior. Inhaling construction dust fucking joke is. Meanwhile, school specifically told (by state, assume) *not* require anyone tested returning campus. going disaster. Probably true ‚Äúsome degree‚Äù necessarily enough get us back normal society. Freedom result injury, damage death, limited. really feeds media frenzy. Elect people think share point view. appropriate nuisance. schools take public education funding

how so? Branson would happen Jesus came back Earth ate Las Vegas, threw Ozarks. I'm stoked financial firms making predictions medicine  Yep, know personal contact college teams too. millions billions dollars stake, convince anything first bite usually fine, second go either way, third start noticing something off, fourth bite check imagination something subpar, fifth bite case fourth wrong, sixth bite determine bad is, seventh bite taken waiting seconds longer case timing issue, eighth chew little longer, ninth last bite take spite chewed partially spat napkin show staff disgusting food was. think vaccine going mandated companies governors won‚Äôt even put mask rules place?

You think ‚Äúmask trampling liberty‚Äù crowd bad. wait ‚Äúforcing vaccines us‚Äù crowd

There 30-35% country completely insane. Expecting wanting right rational thing proven losing strategy long time Like deaths (a total population 34.5 million people) - yet everyone rejoice Portugal 10.28 million day without deaths better? said stupid? assumed risk every day schools open COVID otherwise. ignore fact stupid. virus real, danger not. 70 cancer pneumonia yes, bad. That's though. 99.8% us go back restaurants, gyms, churches... riots, looting, arson.

HCQ works fine, using beginning. lot people died propaganda HCQ.

This operation Democrats destroy economy implement universal basic income get people say Yes whatever Democrats say. thing ""movement"" pay student loans doctors, keep mouths shut they're you.

Try saying Fauci liar sub, mods deleted posts that.

Fauci stands make HUGE money vaccine paid for. Fucking sniveling rat invisible hand tends jerk top, thus leading trickle effect. cant see can't hurt /s Arlington south Mason Dixon Virginia, state seceded union. tends fit two common definitions South. blue, I'll give that, pretty much every Southern metropolitan area. Drive 10 minutes south, hit Alexandria pretty southern vibe. I'll even say this: Washington, DC southern vibe. spread it. Multigenerational families could hit hard children spreading it. police officers live test positive fever symptoms allowed work. I‚Äôm Rhode Island. Yea don‚Äôt disagree that‚Äôs like it, try hold maybe 12 bridge sell thats think know herd immunity even thing? assumes degree immunity, frankly know enough virus even know stay immune.

So assuming get vaccine herd immunity work. Tenants landlords together banks mortgage companies. banks made record profits, tune TRILLIONS dollars since last economic implosion 2008. save profits? They'd better have, live savings while! 

I'd really love see would happen tenants stopped paying rent landlords also stopped paying mortgages.

We're virtual kids. definitely challenge trying navigate multiple zooms online assignments help level. can't imagine sending back school. I‚Äôm glad others see ‚Äúfuck got mine‚Äù shit getting pretty hand. 

Noah- get boat goes back need feel special, feel like pushing envelope. obviously nothing else going lives. hard stand internet showing unremarkable truly are, flipped script use internet feel like *are* remarkable. Sweden lot things, USA media reporting them, maybe show nice live country better social policies. 

Since March (and ongoingly planned keep measures relevant, least unti end year) Swedish government authorities recommended:

* Keep distance, wash hands, cough arm, keep good hygiene.
* visit elderly relatives, first recommendations visit elderly homes, nation-wide ban visits recently changed allow case-by-case exceptions.
* sick, even mild symptoms - stay home. go work, go school, go outside, meet people. keep like least 2 days without symptoms (this prior increased testing, obvious testing also available). 
* Public gatherings 50 people allowed.
* Employers recommended switch workers work home possible. possible government provided employers temporary ""lay off"" system, hours employees significantly reduced government covers 90% salary long employer keeps contracts running. Employers ones responsible employees health safety working environment work cannot performed remotely, need provide hygiene options measures allow distancing employees. Furthermore, belong risk group employer cannot offer remote work, apply ""preventive"" sick leave benefits. 
* Sick leave benefits extended cover everyone paid leave first day, government covering entire sick leave (which normally would paid least partly employer) requirement present doctor's certificate illness extended previous 7 days 14 days. meant people could feel ill report sick self-isolate 14 days return work.
* Kids primary pre-school ages still supposed go school long symptoms. Older students switched remote learning. Parents kids show symptoms (as normal system Sweden) allowed take special paid parental ""sick"" leave take care sick child. 
* businesses allowed operate long could provide improvements allow staff customers follow recommendations hygiene distance. supermarkets mean plexiglass barriers cashiers markings floor queuing customers. 
* Restaurants bars allowed stay open, new regulations limit service table service (so people standing around bar getting place crowded) least meter distance tables. strict inspections reporting places shut follow regulations. Time probably disown her. talking doesn‚Äôt helps please cut looses. mom things adults need work adults. username checks Haha chance. dunno, can't stop pursuit truth morons bad actors might misuse it. I'm applying logic everything. situation requires it. Sending children school result massive increase infection death. I'm ok that. virtual learning isnt effective widens education gap legal issues. Also daycares arent large enough support kids school. travel 23 - 27 paper /rscience ago showed human brain pushes maximum days, result, even intelligent people always teetering brink insanity. society changed fast far us able handle changes. one hypothesis prevalence mental illness human civilization (in time, meaning since agricultural revolution 4,000-6,000 years ago.)

All takes little push far, smart person devolves paranoia cult-like behavior. sweden !?!

Yeah right.... political leaders bright.... bright enough follow officials recommendations Swedish law (I agree subjects).

 confident want country world well. sure realize important is. issue kids. it‚Äôs fact super spreaders. that‚Äôs schools remain closed control. thought manatee died covid19.... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è misleading headline. People turned away hospital want infect whole damn world. still this? ever since got elected. likelihood happening Harambe coming back grave. upvote perfect typo  pretty tragic, also infuriating. debating handing money country *still* lock down, meaning months virus still raging need hand money *again* keep people businesses afloat.

They locked down, paid support people businesses, slowly opened up. done US would decent shape economy schools probably could re-open reasonably safely. Instead pissed away lives money, continue finally shut properly vaccine fairly wide use maybe 6+ months now. pure speculation. seriously doubt ‚ÄúDanish strain coronavirus‚Äù limited Denmark reopening , spread Denmark strains. 

A virus don‚Äôt operate based national borders. Wow. hurt stupid? It‚Äôs waaaaaaaay beyond common knowledge know mortality COVID-19 heavily skewed older population deaths people younger 20 rare almost always get national media coverage. haven‚Äôt grasped concept yet you‚Äôre lost cause, likely intentionally trolling. ""Stable genius"" Citations inclusive studies... confirm. Large portion town refuses wear mask. even got point grocery store hired security enforce masks people bad.

The school started band camp week people enforce 6 feet without masks 3 feet masks one person building time unless emergency. great they're trying safe kids minority wanting masks distance others complain deal corona rules meanwhile football team gets practice crammed locker room weight room without masks times week. Referencing article read week actually

Not exact article, addressing phase 3 trials. work degree. Add PUA benefits going away Americans going work. Tegnell almost reaming top public health figure saying things like: [Tegnell] stated following reasons [for recommending Facemasks ""lull one false ""Anyone puts face mask get virus hands spread oral protection order ""could send signals okay go main argument, said, **""the extremely weak scientific support face masks‚Ä¶ two older studies oral protection SARS epidemic, provide sufficient scientific one bold wrong even funny. Personally affected yes...but they‚Äôre little germ factories spread everyone else. It‚Äôs disaster waiting happen. New research showing kids carry 10 100 times virus nose adults, could effective, more, spreading adults. Also ever met kid? lick hand railings crying loud. We‚Äôve similar issues seafood industry. companies made consider safety migrant workers. seemed stop outbreaks here, except workers community weren‚Äôt considered work close quarters. there‚Äôs lots outbreaks. Nobody wants stay hunkered basement general society want wear mask. ER physician 30+ years experience, dead on. vast majority ER visits non emergent seen another setting. bought small 35 wipes day. First time seen Clorox wipes store since February so. Incompetent leadership modern propaganda make first appointment dental office, way risk absolute lowest. Dentists make sure absolutely safe *hopefully* send patient home he‚Äôs coughing, etc. racist go one minute without mentioning Chicago lmao 40% deaths nusing homes NY NJ incompetence. disaster hurt far kids virus.

That inevitably point. options smoldering ruin economy virus runs rampant. smoldering ruin economy smoldering ruin economy virus runs rampant. people don‚Äôt know NASA centers shows half US population gets flu shot annually. think it‚Äôs doable goal collectively shoot it. Clorox wipes PPP doesn‚Äôt get votes coordinated effort country produce it. Glad do! I‚Äôm working someone whose hoping maybe decentralized model, uses community centers spaces smaller groups children rather huge classes.

Basically children running around house day really tough many (not many) hopefully find good solutions.

Even someone fairly well WiFi house terrible recently. without computers WiFi students staying home also really challenging. Much figure together! thing coming October. know this. vaccine Trumps chance knows it. Weve already seen Russia rush one US same. Weve already mass producing three vaccines least. read turn ad blocker off. Let's fair woman recording actually though. stop murder something; wanted Karen video social media. think strange value judgement someone position like ""I'm going involve this"", knowing there's crazy woman spouting angry nonsense.

As example mean value judgement: years ago standing crowded train bumped someone fault own. dude bumped pushed me, hard purposefully, point nearly knocked people. 20 year old would've gotten guy's face like ""what fuck problem?"" instead thought ""I family; can't risk getting fight stranger pull knife something"" say anything. There's real value conversation.

If someone getting beaten otherwise trouble, value equation changes. I'm arguing would've prudent move scenario bother get involved, cause risk far outweighed benefit. Deaths new cases suddenly lower they‚Äôve month. makes sense me. America suddenly make unbelievable strides flattening curve?

Right seeing effects Fourth July weekend we‚Äôre seeing record low cases? Sure can, White House controlling numbers all. Poor districts spend much per student horrible outcomes. I‚Äôm glad sneezes travel like 12 Delaware south Mason Dixon. 


  


Having Delaware many times tho, definitely southern culture-wise northern Virginia... Yeah vaccine horizon, rush return school? virtual another semester less? study bereft treatments cures.

Do disagree specific point? Ah. bad. rare even register. Oh stop stop. I‚Äôm actual Christian guy 1000 % false teacher NUTJOB. course, trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfaith advisor‚Äù.  Joe ever recommended shoving jade egg private parts leaving there? things worse death. think digital certificate is?!?!  Something gives information. Kinda like microchip right?!? Excuse me, millions civilians armed firearms Russia. Carrying weapon whatever reason usually results pretty long jail term, unless got hunting license (which easy obtain, far know, allows use inferior guns... still dangerous, whatever; there's also ""less lethal"" stuff like pistols rubber bullets, that's still popular one might think).

See, possible US turn Russia. way rednecks would give guns, lmao. usually wait 15-20 mins walk-in clinic Australia. nasty, always thought Sweden standards. idea big class sizes already are? Merging classes teacher would decimate social distancing protocols. cannot done safely all. mention, teacher quarantine, don‚Äôt think students class would exposed well? They‚Äôd quarantine switch online learning. won‚Äôt subs year there‚Äôs way subs want risk health $50 day. don‚Äôt think understand actual chaos going behind scenes trying reopen schools. Really glad somehow ability see future though *so* sure schools won‚Äôt close. Enjoy! lmao

I swear, Disney super-fans completely different breed people FYI opposing billions?? Excellent... we're sending kids back school week, too.

Way go, MS.  /s Agreed NFL better start working Amazon walmart gutted small town retail years Rona came town.

Seems intrsting data coming fast anymore, since HHS took Restaurants stayed open bro. got home one realize pathetic, yes? think states set mail-in weeks?

My states officials saying mid-April late states mail in.

Wear mask, stand six feet away others, vote! Yes, science fiction selling us ‚Äúvideo conference things‚Äù since forever. interpreted something response completely incompatible original intention. know other, backstory judge behavior; one interaction. literally point getting involved people public: inherently unpredictable surprised altercation emerges. think they've using years. think many hand sanitizers popped capitalize sudden interest within various populations buying hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizers widely available pandemic safe effective. can't get rid Trump fast enough. inheritors spent probably billions surveillance network got nullified simple mask. desperately trying fix things socially engineering people wearing them. 

yes, upgrade systems work masks sure take lot time due pandemic. also sure lot inheritors family bet entire family fortune building surveillance system. 

also lack care regarding lives us citizen reveal people control us citizens could careless live die. meaning people worshiping probably mutli-ethnic global network inheritors.  depends area. regions poorer healthcare great incidence higher. factors tuberculosis make nightmare airborne disease though, mostly around long survive air surface. masks bare minimum.

Well shiet, think Trump owes LOT people apology. lot answer for. Hopefully he's still alive. Lemme know people start complaining cops defending themselves. shit strawman. People complaining cops murdering people cold blood. Policy NYC hospitals vent every positive patients. Unneeded ventilations killed many people. infrastructures

No, responsible ""mail infrastructures"" get people count votes.

And hard put mail ballot machine. think absentee votes handled nearly ever state? equipment mail systems already exist. simply need scale up. outbreaks everywhere. average positive test percentage number daily cases, MN top 5 10 non NE states. trending wrong way, like everywhere basically. """"Instead protecting seniors, bill would require state create COVID-19-only facilities, forcing hospitals many nursing homes send COVID-19-positive patients facilities without requirement consent, doctor approval¬†or notification patient family,"" Whitmer added. ""The legislation fails explain facilities would staffed paid for, frail residents would protected potentially traumatic transfer one facility another."" State mass mailed ballots registered voters before. STATE.

You confusing absentee ballots, voters opt to, automatic mailing ballots.

I dunno, r/TwoRedditorsOneCup exists instances exactly like that. said sick high risk seen someone that, would shut teeth out. lift finger.

Oh break ""Myth"" I'm alt right.

Lmao one failed anthropology Explain mutates. Biologically. like, high school biology stuff.

For example, asked explain hands heat rub together really fast, start sputtering ""they heat okay! heat up!"". would probably say ""the rubbing creates friction force friction energy transformed heat"". People done waiting vaccine

Biologically, viruses mutate faster others. still explained nothing mutation process itself. actually even try explain virus mutates. (Hint, involves DNA RNA replication)

Influenza mutates much faster coronavirus. know why?

There's lot politics around well, schools around conducted parent surveys see % want virtual class, generally speaking lot rural schools chosen open person since that's general public wanted. Yep. Current case rate city 1 10k.

Everyone wants test gets one, results 24hrs. believe HK (like mainland China), positive cases isolated hospital regardless severity. Thus, demand hospital beds much greater. temporary hospitals going need stocked ventilators etc.; essentially hotels medical staff present. Check CNN one, shit website ripped from. mean hope works, gets approved, high risk people/health care workers/teachers get vaccinated things end much better Idk people think post office couldn‚Äôt handle this.

Now biologist, taken biology classes. Body recognizes virus markers fights virus produces antibodies attack virus soon reintroduced 

The virus mutate enough markers label virus mutate. go unrecognized body‚Äôs antibodies won‚Äôt recognize fight virus soon someone infected. 

So vaccine produces antibodies, antibodies don‚Äôt recognize viral market, it‚Äôs useless.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Death penalty. Average Chinese city case, places active cases current recent outbreak, Dalian, Urumqi, Beijing etc.

Generally finding single confirmed case entire city go war time conditions, seen Dalian understood one case found must hanging around waiting discovered. Yikes Yup let‚Äôs go back school Masks don‚Äôt stop spread covid viruses general shouldn‚Äôt infections deaths drop drastically? 
Why weren‚Äôt masks enforced day 1 ? Still baby. human brain doesnt fully develop till 25 years old TL;DR: coronavirus simply widespread transmissible. likely scenario, experts say, pandemic ends point‚Äîbecause enough people either infected vaccinated‚Äîbut virus continues circulate lower levels around globe. Cases wax wane time. ....Rather onetime deal, COVID-19 vaccine, arrives, could require booster shots maintain immunity time. might get every year every year, much like flu shot. ....Even virus somehow eliminated human population, could keep circulating animals‚Äîand spread humans again. Unnecessary dangerous. smh. necessarily buy argument markets keep people alive.

Healthcare, sure. Education, I'll concede. Housing food, absolutely. none things require markets. choose markets framework that's choice make.

What, opinion, life saving thing cannot possibly handled outside marketplace? article incorrect, SARS-CoV-1 much higher RO factor COVID-19. 

Scientists unsure SARS-CoV-1 disappeared. impact gun call it. Impact wrench correct term suppose. It‚Äôs English translation, it‚Äôs mechanics tool. Retail place people congregate smaller controlled study posted Canadian covid subreddit showed half adults brain damage disease. I'd assume parents would hesitant send kids school knowing could fuck like that. Maybe less concern football-heavy states, districts big drinkers - plus could mix meds alcohol. 

Having said - week prior NYC locking went liquor store got much champaign could afford. standing line mask gloves, guy behind noticed amount buying asked cashier Alcohol kills COVID? cashier said:‚Äù kills sadness‚Äù :-) Worth noting 1918 domestic pandemic response aided fact Great War ongoing. Anti-maskers could fairly portrayed patriotic duty, indeed portrayed somewhat traitorous war effort. Thats false. counting numbers schools either. What? telling something said countless times since beginning pandemic? crazy. Essential worker here, get temp checked everywhere go prevent high viral load people coming buildings. 

Most places allowing visitors right though. Striking bad idea instance, teacher's strike general strike, teacher's strike. general strike multiple trade unions representing sectors economy strike time solidarity. doesn't/can't really happen US since union participation rate low. also relied *conservative savior Ronnie* put barrier entry foreign competition.  Someone correct wrong, think big portion USA's budget military spending purposes. Italy lot evil scientists. That's like...1.5 million people working towards creating pandemic virus. Supreme Court decision video surveillance (previous decade)

‚ÄúThere expectation privacy public area. government authority use video cameras monitor citizens without infringing privacy rights.‚Äù I'll take *Patently Obvious Statements* $200 please Alex. commend notifying health department. That's enough already especially crazy sound last paragraph. irony much. Going away camp wherein talk ""God"" closer ask protection evil, catch disease pandemic.

But OK right? Because, lemme guess, God's Plan.  Well, that's damn bad this. offer every family school aged children voucher FULL value paid school system federal, state, local governments per capita (per student) basis.

If choose opt public education, get voucher pursue private, remote, home based school environment.

Problem solved. Let parents make decision children. Get government family decisions. This. work retail people go absolutely nuts wipes get in. First all, bet 99% people using wipes following instructions anyway (surface must remain wet wipe 'x' minutes effective). Second, already shown likely get virus air vs. surfaces? Wash hands...wipes unnecessary. I'm 30 year old teacher. single teacher 50 building, terrified. March, lost one COVID. June one students asked ""I sick March. make Ms. X sick?""

 even begin console child thinks killed teacher? degrees crap. American capitalism finest Peace mind invaluable times like this. Nope. Tell story essential workers who, turns out, asshole bosses. electoral college, national level, true. often vote interests. someone came contact exposed covid 12 hours saw them. Would contagious 12 hours exposed? Clearly green line much better overall green line ! We've always good stock ahead pandemic (wife is/was germophobe).

Of course, waste 99% wiping groceries thanks m-f'ing Sanjay Gupta.

Look, get behind wiping something buy immediate consumption. handled handling who-knows-what-else store, cashier handled it, unknown number people handled it. 

But going sit pantry week touch again, even bother. most, take external package, applicable.  Look forward revisiting. problem admitting I‚Äôm wrong. schools afford can't even supply teachers Yeah superintendents state make well 6 figures. don‚Äôt think hearing people‚Äôs experiences help much, it‚Äôs sort like getting shot. bothers people, others don‚Äôt mind all. think might cause vomit, might want bag handy? I‚Äôve deep nasal swabs they‚Äôre unpleasant quick. seconds pain. there's documentary called ""jesus camp"". petty good. parents going divorce devastating mental health. longest time thought Branson imaginary place made writers Simpsons. Germans streets protesting lockdown measures? 

Because deaths people think virus ""completely harmless"", cold ""that worse covid could be"". ""cannot wear mask"", think ""It worst oppression ever. even Hitler forced people wear mask"". ""The one benefiting covid narative Bill Gates."" 

Things quotes things German mother told almost everybody wider community's lives. Since many schools largest employers region, we're basically letting school superintendents govern country haphazard decision-making structure. People aren‚Äôt numbers hoax, everyone. I'm sure realize firms like GS comprised solely FS consultants. hire best brightest experts sectors operate (e.g. energy, transportation, yes, healthcare/life sciences). problem see lot people screaming faster horses, nobody yet envisioned car.

Edit: I'm intending saying everyone wants change, fails show viable alternative actual improvement original. want change much next person, calling change see evidence significant improvement original. believe change happen, take lot inertia break status-quo. live mostly rural Texas county. one tiny hospital biggest town ICU capability. People see virus rural problem people tested positive within county (that know of, testing nearly nonexistent here). still, major impact local population yet. people careless safety precautions. open mouth claim. ones obviously lie. So, think important ask, ""Who benefits everyone accepting new normal?""

Considering states secretly passing immunity shield laws, clear businesses benefit accepting risks necessary.

The reality US could absolutely contain virus locking down. less people out, would less spread, contact tracing would easier. We'd also PPE tests.

And benefits advocating approach? Businesses states lose money working spending.

This article considered sponsored content. paid advertisement. commercial. we, society, determine whether want purchase product advertised here.

I'm interested. know rest I'll declining. see ;) took hospitalization data, daily cases, testing, extension test positivity rates. mean fun terrible. Kinda ""pool water went nose"" feeling. Well one way another gonna live it. can‚Äôt 10% unemployment everything closed forever parents retired public school teachers; taught well. ;) starters, there's lot people affected fit narrative. everybody laid minimum wage employee. making considerably employment financial obligations reflect that- something easily afforded 100k year (car payments, private school tuition, furniture payments, etc.) drowning making unemployment. 

Your going excuse much sympathy people debt luxuries. Especially bringing home money lot essential workers right now, hardest hit people: laid fired, simply 1/5th income coming in- mechanics, plumbers, waitresses, ton blue collar jobs.

All could still qualify benefits. pay time worked reduced Covid qualify course, let's forget people qualify unemployment income ""official"". Handymen, junk haulers, in-home daycare providers, like, many lost income completely near completely government may even considered working, get nothing now. 

This would good point. would willing argue getting benefits. source back aside job loss, let's look thousands parents providing everything kids 18 jobless, completely ignored stimulus child bonus, even thousands people used free childcare via schools, find hundreds thousands budget child care work. 

The adult living could potentially qualify. conceed point working due school relief them. adult age 18 working hard elicit sympathy can't receive unemployment. way one time stimulus payment unemployment ""more enough"" began ordeal crappy, official minimum wage job like fast food worker retail sales associate, kids.

It's enough everyone making less 3k month taxes sizeable chunk population well minimum wage. first bullet point flat wrong. personally know 5 people covid. minor symptoms worst case sick week continued loss smell taste couple more. fine along 4 others 100% week two minor cold. 99.9% protesters wear mask before, protest. also party protest go home separate ways. almost 0 transmission virus protest.

People probably around 2 meters also, proper social distance, like moronic protest. That's another tricky part. Probably teachers age 50. That's mortality stats drop precipitously. exactly people talking mentioned poor mask usage around US though... forgetting become much larger problem... Johns Hopkins map still really considered ""Well-sourced""? figure FAQ Blog data pulled since CDC datafeed gone White House data Extremely Suspect best Horrendously Gerrymandered worst, level trust data low. 10k case day rate dropoff setting sniff test.

Or, data janked hurricane gulf means less people getting tested area currently largest hotspot going on? kids parents 20s 30s. They're much risk either. ultimately parents make decision whether want send kids not. retired, buckle control expenses, broke quickly.

And are. Lol even need money job. destroying public education hobby. zealot. False dilemma fallacy. students educated alive. 

A councilman mental faculty 6-year-old. Shocker. I‚Äôd rather Russia minimal debt (bottom 10 least indebted countries). US course number 1 highest debt.

Let‚Äôs find-out Russian Federation üá∑üá∫ got small debt &amp; copy plan. 

We could probably learn something üá™üá∫ EU think reffering say ‚Äúsusceptible‚Äù? seriously know word means? One thing obviously *haven't* done look science. understand trying defend league denying something even league said ""certainly"" happens? Correct. point US line vast majority world. I've read articles. 9th 19th isnt terrible numbers people claim US. Thats still top 95% country wise regular pay top 90% adjusted cost living.

You also take account average school teacher US works 185 days 15 sicks/vacation days. average year 260 working days minus 22 sick/personal days plays big factor difference. public school teacher well. can't speak northeast, southeast, conditions described.

There sick leave low wage, customer facing employees best times, certainly now. 

The economy weak, employers feel can't begin offering leave times. Besides, wage slaves might get ideas expect keep benefits whenever things go back normal.

Since economy weak, employees willing call sick risk losing jobs. Ah mr. smarty pants wants get technical. ignore Australia mostly barren island nation fraction population United States choose comparisons work you? won‚Äôt. managed get bunch germ-x day. think lot people showing evidence would lead believe work better do. Case point CDC recently circulated case study two stylists back May. would hope time passed since would quality evidence that, yet, choose circulate. get it, CDC mean well, took opinion working influencing public adopt habit feel help, high profile experts like Michael Osterholm sober limitations feels like convincing people work better good evidence could harm good. see point sides, agree Osterholm opinions aren‚Äôt good reason wear mask to, national mandate could negative unintended consequences good point. wooden horse small holes enough arrows fire through, arrows taking people one one, pretending horse empty, ignore people city dropping arrow deaths. think dropped half. believe agency use Telia mobility data could better. Yes would. idiot get go holy shit. Well, does. Funny that. use Sniper spray. originally started using years ago pet messes hospital grade disinfectant certified EPA work Coronavirus. Knuckleheads big parties. Cohasset cancelled high school graduation bunch seniors parents big party masks social distancing never thought before, subliminally associate non mask wearers dirty people poor hygiene...

There still couple good camera shops several excellent independent bookstores, crowds tend pretty old. yeah I'm sick narrative I'm musical genius Thank sharing. I‚Äôll read.

Edit:

There several takeaways article shared support understanding covid transmission.

- Distancing important reduce spread. Possibly important thing.

Understanding means helps us make better decisions. real question is, distancing important, helpful?

Is distant closed room AC distant outdoor setting fresh air? science I‚Äôve researched far agrees same. virus present longer indoors.

How much more? Well, reading get sort answer there. seem agree though indoor settings supportive COVID transmission.

- much masks really help?

It seems like author article clear can, though masks created equal. even focusing droplets expel sides mask.

In unprepared age pandemic think seems reasonable. fact is, don‚Äôt professional grade masks created home. think we‚Äôd favour next pandemic seriously good material available translated every language earth regarding make quality mask possible materials available. Covid highlights vastly unprepared this.

- danger masks complacency. 

Feeling mask work solve issues alone fallacy, one never bought start with. main reason promoting masks believe slow spread. Perhaps people get sick it, that‚Äôs good thing. Anything slows spread considered.

We need practice social distancing, good hygiene, disciplined enough follow emerging science get it.

- Places masks still transmission issues.

Because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfix‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt surprise me. countries try open struggling businesses, encourage travel, re-open schools see problems. It‚Äôs impossible controlled perfect environment.

- Overall, need keep best, people aren‚Äôt even trying.

The people mention one biggest issues. choose stand proud defend belief public safety (or lack of) part problem. need work together. need progressive. need consider others.

That doesn‚Äôt mean think risk safety help others. need take care first, willing take care others. There‚Äôs much former without latter going on.

Anywho ‚Äî thanks time. safe. teachers countries power eject unruly kids? absolutely love blog Lowe‚Äôs commentary, really hopefully monoclonal antibodies! seem like one best ways aside vaccine cut death rate protect people think trying make lost time closed earlier normal back April/May.

Either really want people get back work rules set forth Gov. Kate Brown Oregon Health Authority, campers late last month couldn‚Äôt required wear masks -- didn‚Äôt, Fahlman said. camp held outdoors, transmission less likely.

*surprisedpikachu.jpg* Death greater consequence, like people would even die virus. lot them, getting virus might preferable alternative. know smaller droplets hang around air infectious. Obviously know exist, that's TB measles spread example. Imagine super carriers asymptomatic. virus unstoppable without mass testing vaccine. article new york times describing enabler trump really made realize things  Distance learning absolutely requires someone act coach home. going done long term, implementing passive learning home, i.e., creating educational environment, important. said, distant learning temporary solution virus control. Kids going back school, teachers need fill holes education, ok. People acting like whole generation going illiterate social skills destroyed. evaluate situation every quarter, safe, open classrooms again. course spend countries! responsible protecting all!

But gutted education spending. Per pupil spending even account capital spending (new buildings stuff). right. I'm sorry, extrapolated much comments.

You seem defending hypothetical point made governors potentially making/expecting schools open.

I can't argue directly comments regression, comment point regression, virtual learning useless claim, going inevitable. ...ok? I‚Äôd rather hav

I agree more.

Lung colon cancer. There's statistically significant increase side effects HCQ. Personally, would mark ""negative"" purpose purely look preventative/prophylactic effects HCQ. that's science kind black white classification stupid.

All said marking positive clearly incorrect. Without help federal government, lot people choice rolling dice losing job. Good news! Everyone NOLA already fat stupid. Going school could actually change that, though. Middle-class upper-class parents probably manage decently.

Lower-class people *really* need school. friends bought case wipes costco, dumb luck. gave us 250. used like 2. really supposed wiping? mean, yes. they're following CDC guidelines: Even continuing test positive considered non-infectious 10 days post-symptom onset mild cases, 20 days severe cases.

* persons COVID-19 illness, isolation precautions generally discontinued 10 days *after symptom onset*1 resolution fever least 24 hours, without use fever-reducing medications, improvement symptoms.
  * limited number persons severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days may warrant extending duration isolation precautions 20 days symptom onset; consider consultation infection control experts.
* persons never develop symptoms, isolation precautions discontinued 10 days *after date first positive RT-PCR test SARS-CoV-2 RNA.*

We‚Äôre fucked. I'm gonna jump ask question get downvoted hell works here. widely observed children display incredibly low risk getting ill virus, correct? could venture guess statistically lower chance children dying virus.

In regard, comment come across even *slightly* alarmist irrational? go educate myself? ""know"" vs ""know of"" ... definitely American English. survey linked teachers one particular point time. think use estimate average age people would exposure potential increased single point time (say, schools open summer 2020). Neither Nixon, Reagan could get nominated Republican presidential candidate today. they're dead. always thought bleach would, well, bleach things. add bleach (watered down? ratio?) spray bottle, spray house (door knobs, furniture, counters, light switches, etc.) discolor/ruin anything?

AWESOME. guess good job keeping secret. personally even think politicians believe shit say...like say know makes look stupid plays target audience lulls opposing side believing stupid therefore less threat. 

If one people see shanadagens even care minority. sounds like right way it. I'm favor! Count in. California bigger population Tennessee, it‚Äôs surprise total cases. Per capita, cases Tennessee.
But also dumb people everywhere. Dare say...It's Boomer mentality. Unless Ducey changes it, seems like schools expecting students 17th.  one makes alcohol wipes? pissed off. Anyone looks situation objectively knows cases going lead school closures eventually. idiots spent much time planning ""safe"" reopening given thought they'll handle inevitable shutdown. ignored making plans reopen devoted time planning effective distance learning strategy. now. hospitals get overwhelmed we'll see long lasts.

Yeah theres definitely alot cases 5 million... [Missouri Governor Mike Parson kids returning kids got get back school.

Anyone reopening anything point simply sacrificing people keep megabillionaires mega-rich. shutdown made drop notch super-rich. push masks everyone bandaid, solution actually fix problem gives excuse open everything back let people start dying huge numbers keep economy mega-rich bank accounts flowing wealth.

Exactly, either got work get work. Agreed. Fire teachers use Khan Academy. Save $$$ vaccine **are** technically developed already. They‚Äôre tested make sure work gonna force employees physically show up, even inaccurate test better test Here's idea. Push pause school years. Wait vaccine. vaccine arrives everyone's vaccinated, unpause. fucking suck anyway. Read back brand. Almost noone uses right since surface cleaned needs stay wet least 4 minutes kill viruses. Peroxide, alcohol soap water waaaaaay better. live Massachusetts saw eyes Latin community follow guidance state officials. conspiracy? I'm simply saying government's reaction foolish, short-sighted, counter-productive. NY ghost town Cuomo sudden fancied war time leader shut everything down, destroying thousands peoples livelihoods process. know doing. accept keeping us lockdown long feel like Thats sad man. Going *bar*... thats worst option. absolutely go go nice distsnced outdoor restraunt better yet, order take home.

I wish advice. Perhaps offer less risky ideas? know whole group friends different levels pausing. sometimes hang pairs outside thats do. 

Ive furlouged, university shut 6 months later still try stay inside minimize spread along valveless n95. individuals face disaster.

We dont totally stop lives, people like friend took minimal precautions wouldnt here. frustraiting. sacrificing millions families 'respectful'? Hopefully, math way frightening, apocalyptic. 20 million 155000 dead way better 5 million cases 155000 dead, works like 12 million dead 350 million population. kill 99.99% germs like Lysol does? seems focus removing smells. know ask Alabama, might surprise last month mask thing finally sunk (it's also mandatory state, county stores). people wear masks now. remote learning teach kids effectively like think does. economy also cannot afford millions kids individually watched parent used single teacher watching dozens. complicated realize. thug matter find, Chinese science community lost. propaganda China changed often, wet market wet markets came abroad. take decades Chinese scientists become trustable ever case again. Lol Sweet! Open completely like first time lol Nursing homes skilled nursing facilities, fact, terms get divvied even that. terms changed avoid stigma emphasize level constant care performed, similar stigmatized terminology changes time. Like, one wants send GamGam nursing home longer care her, skilled nursing facility round-the-clock cargivers? sounds like ticket. 

There thing describing. SNFs take people expected recover aren't, though occasionally, dedicated wings dementia patients.

Regardless, trying parse linguistics besides point. Working ICU, gross knowledge happens covid gets introduced facilities. even proper PPE hospital, think staff protected? gets summarily distributed nearly every resident. facilites try get stay ahead it, kind losing game. point isolated causes suffering, I'll point dwarfed comparison suffering disease causes. Meh. mindset exists everywhere. Governors responsible pandering leading people appropriately. I'm south. lots smart, civic minded people, especially Metro areas like Atlanta suburban Atlanta. 

I think also level denial people live order survive. Many, many people south working class need businesses stay open operate certain level. savings back plans. work. think poor defense mechanism. see mindset many places. southern thing. 

I think working class people deeply care working class people, time resources care much else.  wish cool you, you‚Äôre right everything everyone else clearly I‚Äôve literally sitting day daydreaming, ‚ÄúGod would cool Maybe it‚Äôs maybeline think you‚Äôre born Ugh jealous.

nice meltdown People think Ohio conservative state... reality urban suburban communities terrible voter turnout Thanks part. done right thing. Dude think need chill out. 

It‚Äôs possible someone (ie me) recognize coronavirus extremely serious needs dealt otherwise extreme measures, also recognize runaway alarmism detrimental everyone involved. Im latino
We make majority cases state even though we're 6% population.

My parents lucky enough educated, went back school got second degrees could get better jobs. mom teacher could work home, dad works manufacturing company took social distancing seriously.

Other latinos lucky. Lots us work jobs can't social distance, lots us underpaid.
Lots us bad position go back work less hours higher risk. can't quit job market shambles get UI benefits.
Its even worse illegal immigrants, safety net.

 Imo black people lower class white people going thing.

The people really spared pandemic ones middle class above. people generally jobs home, enough saving support months. Trump shut flights China called racist Democratic leaders parade Chinatown telling people come join in.

The truth Trump hard core shut mandated masks, people would called dictator fought every step way.

The people want mail voting protesting mass past two months. misled choose follow. Life full choices, forced. people choosing stick head sand follow idiots I'll take two grain thing probably came indoctrination Adventist church. -source - grew church old enough think ditched like bad habit.  fact trump isn‚Äôt even sending kids back school tell need know Use. Soap. course do, since probably spent lot people make year's time throw it. üòÇ Yeah 45% completely insignificant. dodged question. disagree science started seeing new evidence showed opening schools bad idea. still disagree science schools open, countries done success cases millions like America. Israel tried low case load made error mask policy resulting 200 positive cases among students 25 positive cases among teachers. America 62 times number cases Israel has, can't try imitate done expect successful. 

We mock mask skeptics back science. Providing evidence masks dont help arguments mostly bad faith, always issue freedom science seen new evidence backing anti mask stance.

You're right, Covid deadly, caused equivalent 53 9/11s till date obviously anything alarmed personally affects you. point appears since say ""some black people dirty"" say ""some forms masculinity toxic"". reason say first one racist. Make point without comparing something racist. ethical option shutdown. Problem system isnt designed serve anything close ethical. knowledge problems arise lockdown would easier plan counter things would shield risk *many* disorders lie beneath surface childhood know many kids undiagnosed conditions *undiagnosed*.

NOTHING data we've seen 6 months tells us take risks this. agreed. teachers choice there. 
 
the administrators forced follow-up board meeting school classroom *not* zoom vote yes teachers/students return. I‚Äôm personally ok this. It‚Äôs weird freedom whatever want isn‚Äôt thing freedom consequences actions.

But way common hang around exploit locals help them. shop day. Conversation middle-aged man woman. saying one actually understands vaccines work, ""you see flu jab thing every year yet people still get flu, clearly work, people still fall it!""

Many people learn science. scary not... idea based fantasy realistically entire population prove immunity. Currently can't even prove single person immune, let alone massive scale. 
Not mention, (hypothetical) immunization ineffective realistically impacts health anyone yourself, probably go back traveling. going able force entire planet take vaccine letting travelers country going slightly reduced rate COVID probably best idea. times environment forces businesses change render obsolete.

0 brain. man 80 years old. strawman say deemed anybody unworthy getting vaccine

Did write someone people necessarily need get vaccinated fall/winter high risk individuals, healthcare workers, teachers

If wrote that, explicitly states everyone list ""necessarily need \[sic\]"" vaccine unstated time.

You seem confused argument claiming think people need get others. argument everyone equally worthy vaccine get it? That's logistics problem.

Maybe understand position logistical argument: Groups A, B, C get vaccine first, groups D, E, F get it, etc. everyone gets it--not \*choice\* enough go around...is exactly started conversation wanted argue against. problem claim study differences 19%. Way less 19% men fit lower-end category non-overlapping distribution.

We know why. study unsubstantial proves men believed time asking, likely believe first place (therefore ignoring prior factors conspiracy theorists targeting male audiences). shot argument  WI here....cases growing quickly... High School sports starting two weeks....(because WIAA, whose office closed via Zoom, push spring).... Masks FINALLY ""required"" stop seeing someone store yesterday without one.....

Yeah, we're fucked. school planning 5 days person school. Exactly, without firearms people able impulsively kill people easily.

Marry me? Maybe? Thats entirely true, wearing mask taking proper precautions still greatly reduce risk getting infected time lowering viral load case still get infected.

Wear mask remain vigilant. Remember took federal action stop riots (which big spreader covid) called fascist it?  think given state things action warrants kind consequence. Spitting considered battery don‚Äôt see much difference here. Building working relationship folks important too.

Sure, people going ""you can't tell do"" instinct, many people manipulated believing medical emergencies political issues corporate interests. 


This really extend, pointed out, whole idea getting big government people's backs. legitimate cases tyranny (some grand display type), much US dominated vicious cycle caused wealth inequality. 


People get poorer, need system they're paying properly support them, would drain resources engorging wallets wealthy, wealthy convince poor public assistance desperately need expensive. mean, look you! barely afford feed yourself! really want *the government* forcing help pay feed someone else? 


In sense, rich convince poor work self interests weaponizing desperation simultaneously spreading distaste lower rungs society. 


To ensure spell remains unbroken, wealthy use political influence sabotage public infrastructure name A: making money privatization industry, B: convincing people government incompetent deliver actually useful services. (This currently going USPS.) 


Once process complete, left someone believes government, organization meant represent organized people (in democratic ideal, least), failed experiment, best option every man themselves. realize equivalent sending away ref opponent horseshoes boxing gloves. think ref gone pull knife win match, realize ref thing preventing guy pulling assault rifle.

This form better idea main risk vectors I'm moving around society.

I've read mainly Aerosols Droplets would like feedback thoughts that. I've read little surfaces wondering lot.

Aerosols, I'm correct, tiny airborne droplets may contain virus particles.
Above certain threshold, density viral load present air infect people.
This aerosol transmission unlikely outdoors good ventilated spaces also wearing mask protects (since particles penetrate mask) others (since particles captured more). 
Social distancing protects little this, since might walk viral cloud.
In view restaurants closed spaces, main risk would lot people together, slowly raising viral load air, making infection likely.
Certain case studies revealed
Is correct? big significant risk source infection? opinions, research studies welcome!

Droplets bigger drops water containing virus.
This biggest infection risk involves people coughing, speaking loudly, sneezing, etc droplets falling thereby infecting.
This mask protective others: block nearly bigger drops. really protect someone sneezing however.
It also social distancing important, since bigger droplets generally cannot travel far (1-2m)
Is correct? think main way people infected? opinions, research studies welcome!

Finally, surface transmissions. know studies this, beyond fact virus survive surfaces environments couple days.
So regularly wash hands try avoid touching face. sanitizing surfaces? sometimes see people constantly cleaning chairs tools sometimes all.
Are many documented cases somebody got infected touching item surface (door knobs, pens, payment terminals, ...) infectious?
How big risk? I've read little this. 

One reasons asking move cities soon, going public places, wondering best preventive measures beyond mouth masks, social distancing, hand washing. many cases people respected rules still got infected? looking info topics specific sources infection transmissions general! power institution impose social distancing. literally separate cages. would think would little better.

Good bye. It‚Äôs lie. Open mind research Lol pandemic hundred years ago. Look hypocrites now. I'm not, though. Please stop hostile. LOL Trump bypassed CDC statistical data gathering abs reporting. COVID data reported Whitehouse release data. lot people circle looking numbers concluding it‚Äôs bad. Statistically might right find eventually. point article? odds beat. US Texas strong leadership, Americans would actually follow guidelines worked pretty much every country Europe Asia, odds catching virus would virtually nil now.

Blaming victim another way deflect responsibility happening all. plenty blame go around though: hate break you, children die every day. unfathomably tragic.
 
By logic, one would anything every again.
 
Except that's humanity works, thankfully. Yes might take time things get bad will. People spend savings have, put money credit card one, ask money family, negotiate landlord, eventually, jobs coming back lot people choice leave homes.

Elected officials clue, winging everything, see happens. think people forget always cold flu season. Now, imagine everyone cold flu. way know assume covid. enough tests this, people quarantine. Narcissistic psychopath. (not you, rump) think make good point! That's precisely mean investing reform. 

The education system barely changed 100 years, yet life technology changed drastically even mere 20. can't say know exactly new system look like either, still recognize need change push it. nothing virus lol think you‚Äôre missing point. ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù current historical connotations exist Jesus time. may existed descriptor current meaning.

Next question. AK market crazy though, even trash-tier rifles $600+, definitely get pretty decent AR price point. pre-ban rifles super expensive now, kinda doubt Mr Crazypants using one those.

Remember open letter 'public health experts' beginning mass protests explicitly said 'BLM protests put people risk contracting virus' next sentence said 'this mean protests acceptable, anti-lockdown protests evil definitely increase spread virus'...

Among things, resulted fewer fewer patients receiving planned operations within time frame care guarantee, enshrined Health Care Act. According it, decision action, one wait maximum 90 days. 

In June, regions succeeded achieving goal 45 per cent cases - marked decrease January target fulfillment 72 per cent. figure also lowest six years SKR (Sweden's municipalities regions) comparable statistics.

The change affected different parts care - largest reduction number operations taken place orthopedics, general surgery eye care, however, according National Board Health Welfare.

But big differences across country. parts low moderate spread coronavirus - example Sk√•ne, Sm√•land Blekinge - care affected extent.

At end June, National Board Health Welfare commissioned government support regions handle pent-up need care. Among things, may involve, based available data, creating national situational pictures situation looks like across country. 15 September, must present plan.

**What care debt cost unclear. Stockholm Region previously presented estimate SEK 1.5-2 billion.**
 
In May, SKR estimated sum SEK 8-10 billion whole Sweden. Annika Wallenskog, chief economist organization, points out, however, rough estimate.

#The health care guarantee 

The regions' obligation offer care guarantee part Health Care Act Patient Act. 

The goal increase availability planned care eliminate queues waiting times. 
 
The guarantee means must:

Get touch primary care within 0 days.

Get medical assessment within 3 days.

Get first visit specialized care within 90 days.	

After decision, get operation / measure within specialized care within 90 days.

SKR (Sweden's municipalities regions) comparable statistics 2014. Since then, target fulfillment operation / measure never low 45 percent, June 2020. 

 
More 115,000 Swedes line operation measure specialized care. 60,000 waited longer maximum limit care guarantee.

According Sweden's perioperative register (SPOR), approximately 70,000 fewer operations performed usual spring. may due fact many, despite need, wait seek care thus referred surgery. add sum dark number, means number people care queue approximately 185,000.

Danish Crown Ringsted latest example series outbreaks coronavirus slaughterhouses. due low temperatures bad air? Migrant workers living cramped conditions? maybe infectious pigs?

When see major outbreaks coronavirus slaughterhouses, due‚Ä¶

Yes, one really knows sure.

‚ÄúIt system error slaughterhouses worldwide. seen pattern US, England, Ireland, Germany elsewhere. strange, ¬´says Hans J√∏rn Kolmos, professor clinical microbiology University Southern Denmark expert hygiene infection humans animals.

In Denmark, question highly topical 62 900 employees Danish Crown's slaughterhouse Ringsted tested positive. scientific literature field limited.

""None articles describe infectious events result major outbreaks SARS-CoV-2 meat processing similar food processing plants,"" states German research team new study outbreak Germany's largest slaughterhouse.

But plenty theories. Roughly speaking, fall three categories: migrant worker theory, work environment theory, animal theory. Information tries give overview here.

#Eastern Europeans

In Germany, relatively high proportion Poles migrant workers employed country's slaughterhouses mentioned possible explanation.

""It fact come Eastern Europe problem. cramped living conditions, walk close other, course something contributes virus spreading easily, ""says Allan Randrup Thomsen, professor virology University Copenhagen.

Also Danish Crown's slaughterhouse Ringsted, many employees Eastern Europe, company's press manager, Jens Hansen, told TV 2. According press manager, majority live together small apartments, share toilet drive together work.

But explanation, question see similar outbreaks industries also make use foreign labor large scale, says Hans J√∏rn Kolmos.

""For example, seen metro construction,"" says.

Nor German research team investigated outbreak coronavirus Germany's largest slaughterhouse found evidence primary explanation. Sharing apartments, bedrooms cars 'does appear played major role original outbreak described study', according article, yet peer review. However, researchers add 'very well' may factor relation second larger outbreak came month first.

#Cold air poor ventilation

Another widespread theory working environment indoor climate slaughterhouses.

""We dealing relatively dense environment cool air, virus likes spread,"" says Allan Randrup Thomsen.

""At time, probably speak loudly communicate, course means drops sent longer journey otherwise.""

Through analyzes samples infected employees, German research team investigated outbreak German slaughterhouse believes trace majority infection back one employee. results suggest infection occurred workplace, infected colleagues worked way eight meters away. possible, researchers explain, among things, low temperatures poor indoor climate. air slaughterhouse recycled unfiltered air conditioners fans.

""Our results indicate physical distance two meters enough prevent spread environments like this,"" researchers conclude.

#Infected animals

Finally, ""the elephant room"", Hans J√∏rn Kolmos puts it.

""It could animals bring virus infect employees slaughtered,"" says.

It theory currently relatively alone with.

‚ÄúNor saying pigs carriers. think investigate it, ""says Hans J√∏rn Kolmos.

""It caught thin air, pigs receptor airways similar humans.""

He also refers fact outbreak corona infection mink farms Hj√∏rring, time outbreak epidemic area. Preliminary results genetic studies Statens Serum Institut shown infected animals humans one mink farms ""infected other"", infection also involved several sick residents nursing home city. However, whether humans infected animals, whether infection gone way, study could determine.

Mink fed, among things, slaughterhouse waste pig slaughterhouses could potentially infected way, Hans J√∏rn Kolmos explains. hand, attempts far made infect pigs coronavirus able prove animals became infected sick, explains.

‚ÄòBut it‚Äôs small trials, it‚Äôs flimsy foundation. also rule pigs carriers virus without getting sick, ""he says.

Allan Randrup Thomsen immediately skeptical theory.

""Of course never say never,"" says.

‚ÄòBut think theoretical consideration rather practical one. come across anything literature supports pigs could support replication particular coronavirus. "" agree, least drive around pick trucks harass throw beer bottles them. better argument? guy asked explanation laugh him?

I hard time following logic here. We're told gather small groups socially distance time we're also told piling thousands people close proximity together okay.

Maybe correct, I'm going need breakdown logic there. two things seem polar opposites other, saying go hand hand. So... let's see evidence, least something ""you're trying hard. Lol"". depends, unable feel shame they're [doing people trying shame haters, something ashamed of? You‚Äôre right, didn‚Äôt catch virus. could completely quarantined. virus didn‚Äôt walk front door. guy either somewhere shouldn‚Äôt people shouldn‚Äôt around. Home theaters made theaters disposable average American. also Transcription Mediated Amplification test already approved use. mentioning molecular, isothermic, require PCR lysing agent seems short supply. would anyone right mind get cruise ship anymore? Wait vaccine. Close, American military leader mad troops using apps hook up, though can't imagine Japanese leadership/citizenry thrilled either. article also specify American soldiers hooking locals soldiers. I'm going pretend know man's circumstances, general, asking someone ""why stay home"" ridiculous, nonsensical question ask. large portion people CANNOT stay home, especially 5+ months without end clearly sight. odd today STILL August 4th,    
so would odd data today already calculated published. also report many total PCR tests conducted today well??? might true, seems like unrealistic target set. I'm quite sure we'd went back early-April state things today. love eastern philosophy karma relegated level thoughts prayers. Karma points rack good, lose something bad. sum totality person's actions. meant effect next life cycle samsara, cause bad luck current life. think many people take context. Ah yeah, relevant research get first line ethics board, read measures place speed wait approval ""small"" things. thinking about, could quite dangerous. :)

By way translation ""information **researchers** requirements consent"", Swedish text says ""forskingspersoner"", human test subjects.  Millions company makes large portion money cloud systems drives real value growth. true, nearly rampant EVERYONE supposed do. 

Things like wearing mask. protect much protect everyone else. insane! sane country roads Sturgis would closed rally shut down. Thank Donald Trump. Florida. Must something water  Face palm yourself... prepared doesnt mean effective. Words meaning kiddo. Don‚Äôt lie shit, I‚Äôm assuming anything. contrary lies, 28% excess deaths even beyond claimed covid19 deaths. lies correct, would even 28% excess deaths people ‚Äúless likely‚Äù go hospital. like Con, you‚Äôre fabricating lies zero lies evidence. can't wish Karma people would hella cruel. Correct I‚Äôm wrong, contact tracing doesn‚Äôt much good it‚Äôs already widespread, right? Like works Korea places smaller, easily traceable clusters, less you‚Äôre getting thousands cases day. depressed. clear, long haul. I‚Äôve come terms accept ending time soon. Even good working vaccine seems life won‚Äôt back pre-covid normality late 2021 estimates, 2022 even. director also pretty much said could impact society *decades.* yes. washing cotton mask regularly. Source? It‚Äôs sad point freedom America stood changed dreams endless open ended fuck you, want shout ‚ÄúAMERICA!‚Äù

Patriotism what‚Äôs best country people chance achieve dreams. selfless things country Americans. it‚Äôs American holding flag. people different guys read r/niceguys. say patriot days. Chances not. Actions always show true motive. others said, they've reached testing capacity backlogged. There's numerous articles sub Fauci saying kids invincible much coronavirus spread schools Israel.

Get misinformation. Who. countries pays everyone attend college? think system would work united states? may certain business pay people go school, certainly kid go grand canyon university major french literature.

Trump literally held rallies thing underway. live EU country, governments FAR Rip Dave, sending love David sub. miss you. ...may Karma find all! Keeps kids home.

""No determinations carried, true, simple representative democracy, consent majority representatives"" - John Adams.  firstborn demanded tribute US economy! Fair.

A big first step would states either force schools close safety reasons school put effort distance methods option (and probably become cases force shutdowns).

At least give flexibility based local needs (though think in-school programs sort unnecessarily dangerous right now; nobody ever school employee educated adult thinks children use PPE consistently correctly, follow safety directives perfectly.)

The whole, open person give funding, psychopathic. whole, need schools open free day care (which also think open) thing much better. Wait, argument putting kids school ‚Äòfuck it, parents going get sick, anyway?‚Äô keep seeing arbitrary date future picked, like things going different month two now. city, teachers wanting delay in-person classes November. going vaccine November. situation today. People deluding themselves.

At point we're going acknowledge reality, fundamentally change lot things work, order deal virus. Picking random date couple months delaying inevitable. Probably accurate. There's horrible people forget... people trying get day. watch/read news, time energy try figure what's true not. surely see things saying wear mask, also get ""news"" friends boat. strong federal response could much good time like this.

A sect caused human death - completely unnecessarily. 

Bj√∂rn Olsen went hard Public Health Agency [summer talk P1]( 

But professor admits wrong covid-19 pandemic.

And happy sit authority's expert group.

Most public health authority's critics hold back summer talk p1. accused authority sect stubborn strategy caused premature death people. things went wrong could gone wrong.

And media obedient followers. 

The reactions program long coming, negative positive. Wednesday, two days later, calmer. drive shut down. Bj√∂rn Olsen, professor infectious diseases, rests Ume√• (""I hidden here""). interview phone.

- turbulent. think media would hasty. probably thought would endure little more, says laughs little.

He refers criticism program journalists' reporting Public Health Agency. all, press conferences lacked sharp questions.

**What questions think asked, asked?**

- issue asymptomatic transmission, example.

**What mean then?**

- completely symptom-free carrier. something become clear. seen surveys foreign surveys well. really spread infection without symptoms. Especially cramped spaces. face masks come in, says.

- prevent infection. 100 percent, maybe 60 percent. Together measures, quite good.

**But said January Morgonpasset P3 mask work. said: reason run around face mask. rational scientific reasons wear mask.**

- believe face masks. put context. people hadface masks noses, foreheads, everywhere. Since then, made huge increase knowledge recent months. **I wrong, Public Health Agency wrong, many wrong. prepared change.**

**But scientific studies masks hardly changed short time.**

- Oh. many studies this. may possible evaluate percentage face masks help, see measures work together.
- learned very, much.

**Is risk sounding hindsight? January March, knowledge.**

- Sure sure. started advocating face masks little later data started come works. That's science, change feet sometimes. gain new knowledge time.

- many times revised opinion virus journey?

**Today, Sweden low spread infection low death rates. action take now?**

- hold on, hold measures social distancing taken. one must understand pandemic often lasts longer six months. extremely dynamic course. human behavior increases infection, virus itself. communicating right way, think Swedish Public Health Agency done good job.

**You talked P1 Public Health Agency sectarian, need dissidents.**
 
- Yes, devil's lawyer. research groups it, need someone says: ""Stop, really trust this?"".

**Did want person?**

- Yes, would liked be. another aspect this, different angle? would liked it.

**Do personally feel bitter part expert group?**

- #No no, get feeling? No, all, I'm bitter way, way now. tragic many people died died unnecessarily, think. death rates far neighboring countries. think country. question come table often.

**But Nordic countries used face masks great extent.**

- No, tradition Scandinavian countries. Again, 100% solution. gives additive effects.

**Will see increased spread autumn, think?**

- see properly increased spread Sweden, think so. regional outbreaks. Especially gather holidays. stressing since march regarding covid? difficulty brings lifes regarding work, health, safety, political public whirlpool? understandable much want protect others careful responsible, goes months hard stick it. social beings want close contact human beings. probably advised travel stay friends, going also exagerate mental state. avoided contact months probably take many months type contact considered safe again. decide wants/needs go, given still high alert mode, takes precautions, wears mask public spaces airplanes, washes hands regularly, fun stuff.

I genuinely asking anecdotal evidence shows opposite coworkers would touch faces more, especially around chin, mouth, nose area without masks. (Scratching facial hair, correcting makeup, unconscious itching, etc)

With mask, became cognizant attempting touch face started decreasing habit. anecdotal I'd interested see empirical evidence supporting claims.

So much shade thrown sentence. Savage reporting isn't. transferred hospital, probably unnecessarily. realize you‚Äôre probably troll, chance anyone else reading this, here‚Äôs line line breakdown claims made, references linked 70% antibiotics used United States given hogs, cattle, chickens.

Edit: formatting Idiots think could go either way honestly. time goes on, see resistance people area, wanting ignore pandemic even thing. includes ushering children fat ass around without masks on, pretending like everything fine everyone wearing mask must scared weak little person.

If people least, adhere social distancing rules, see lower flu cases year, many unfortunate situations school days illness spread. Schools always epicenters community spread illness. Usually matter much. year... yikes.  reminds George Burns without thick Glasses cigar short, RNA blueprint. physical shape RNA used create proteins, either make structure body perform tasks inside body. shaped bit like long, long ladder. would sides ""ladder"" support structure, ""rungs"" actual molecules serve blueprint create molecules.

The blueprint RNA used make proteins, used make RNA. DNA RNA replication transcription mutations. However, organisms, majority DNA genome (ie, ""rungs"" ""ladder"") never get used. They're junk RNA. mutations literally nothing. genome SARS-COV-2 30,000 genes long, best tell, 80% 30,000 junk. means statistically, mutations matter.

Unlike flu, coronavirus special protein active replication ""proofreads"" replicated strand errors gets rid them. makes really hard big chunks virus change. flu kind unique none safeguards, whole chunk code changed deleted.

What makes SARS-COV-2 deadly spike proteins. mutate, making vaccine work more, going probably take year. mutation would probably make less deadly. current vaccines building antibodies spike proteins, even though SARS-COV-2 various mutations floating around, clinical trials vaccine still works. Sister, ninos trying release wiggles. can. bad, worse March-April levels. Take upvote mentioning Temple manner, I‚Äôd like clarify since last decade started win things sometimes.

Whether want admit not, COVID stay. ain‚Äôt going anywhere. point, skeptics anti-vaxxers going deal it, say ‚Äúdeal it‚Äù like said, COVID isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

OUR BATTLE LEGENDARY feel like I'm smooth brain idiot able think straight months. Glad I'm alone Iol. Think teachers feel! whole country doesn‚Äôt see human! can‚Äôt. conspiracy theory needs stop.

Recently, around end June, fought second pneumonia year, second time hard time breathing physically hurt breathe. X-ray alarming got PCR test, came back negative. later antibody test came back postive, apparently second pneumonia might attributed lungs damaged first time. (during first pneumonia, middle Defcon-T (March), get test, suffered home.)

I weak combined 2 weeks pneumonia, bedridden well enough cook myself, eventually passed.

Honestly, I'm best health fight this, since I've always respiratory issues asthma dust/cockroach allergies gives dry coughs even I'm sick.

I'm sure I'm rambling here, I'm convinced low fatality rates around world due mass innoculation originally TB.

This vaccine seems work basically newborn, new parent, think definitely something consider. Anyone ever *met* children really surprised this. Dont eat bats, happen certain people didnt eat nasty ass foods You‚Äôre totally right, didn‚Äôt even notice earlier.

We celebrated birthday today, actually. would 66 today. Love you, Mom. Since time compare prison conditions incarceration rate places like China, gives apparent excuse neglect problem. PPE people using 100%. everyone used properly socially distanced would GREATLY reduce infections one person using mask still catch it. That's point everyone wear them. even then, unless n100 respirators googles avoid cross-contamination (gloves hand washing, etc) still happen.

Again... say worth wearing partial protection. is. that's is.  Insanity.  need escape first _ well otherwise shruggle looks like YAY.

Yeah going move states like Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Kentucky wearing masks, they're going back school full time, play high school football, bars open. Despite fact states already beginning epidemic. headlines ridiculous.

Ok, virus drops October what? season? People need stop pessimistic. virus go away eventually.

Do know exchange different set? (ours Christmas holiday themed)



Kinda rambling story:
I remember parents this, 20ish (maybe even 25 years ago) China (I think pretty nice, like special store) gotten wedding gift never even unpacked decided try exchange whatever could since storage. remember mom super shocked excited agreed exchange entire set something liked better. bought god damn hutch, refurbished China/cabinet like entire wall kitchen. loves cooking know proud something serves those. Dems pushing immunity........ Jokes already  Mississippi still mask mandate social distancing restrictions place... schools reopening :( 

Alabama getting fucked hard now. state who's governor said, ""We're California"".

She's right... they're way way worse least appears Cali turning corner. ‚ÄúThis first time‚Äù
-Teachers state's setting records, go makes thankful sweet mom always extremely nice almost everyone meets. class act that, 61, anti-boomer/karen. ‚ù§ Latino communities.

I live Latino majority area zero social distancing, lots family parties church services, multi generational housing, masks. lockdown rules go completely every aspect culture.

I really like neighbors, miss them, I'm staying far away possible. like simple concept yet lost many. think better everyone! stupid things hurt people right way! disposable mask bought Amazon protects you. Fun fact people Cobb: couple years back, lawsuit filed county HS biology curriculum required us learn evolution. stickers front textbooks basically saying evolution theory.

I‚Äôm sorry negating one best friend‚Äôs PhD you‚Äôve following story 3 months really offensive. =(

This back March. friend (who know also messaged with) told back March nothing. CDC sending home wasnt serious.... SO, trust CDC government. think truths things read lines. CDC friend sent across country work Covod gave impression flu worse...... argue reason keep bonds? that‚Äôs like selling item facebook marketplace, instead bringing item, bring picture item phone. joke, also depends get made. sandwiches described worst subway sandwich posts sound horrific really hope happens soon wake call morons Like cleaning, inside? Yeap, Zap butthole kill colon cancer there. Well Florida, Arizona, Texas hospitalizations either peaked started decrease. guess sub needs new group states wag finger at. come knowing epidemiologists Reddit shame next group bad boys girls. It‚Äôs Deep South time they‚Äôll really live round.

It‚Äôs almost people think masks social distancing enough eradicate virus. lesson Australia, Japan, China, etc. matter strictly enforced lockdown, eventually come air, spread pick left off. People need earn living eat. can‚Äôt go grid six months. yes, let‚Äôs try social distance wear masks, isn‚Äôt going eradicate it. Even hole six months like hermits, spread would continue moment step outside. Wait someone recorded walking dog gave police? fallacies? Pretty much says wants implant ""digital certificate"" people. Appreciate it! can't read articles pretty much every news site gets linked reddit anymore.  Honest question. happens promise enough someone skips? I'm curious countries it. hookups.

Refrain grandma.  think earned right confront governor Congressional representatives taking seriously. states least counties / cities US moving cashless bond.  new york city (or state) . least 2-3% america better system now. knew. lot things really.

She charged attempted murder. I'm literally face face patients day field, diagnostics, swell. Top tier Trump logic. 80s/early 90s reports addicts ""armed robberies"" using syringes blood they'd claim HIV - see different. ""1st all, 1% awful lot. worse responders catastophically bad""

I mean seroprevalence studies, case counts. 16 countries matched case counts, probably half reality. 1% necessarily huge amount population infected something contagious flu, guarantee looking small minority countries keep level next March full range seasons wider results studies available.

 ""Blamed"" country, even know parse conversation. little reality. Currently Aus deaths per million right bottom Europe. rise current surge? Sure see indication they'll end one worse countries. They'll worst Oceania, end day, probably. ""President Trump's claim [....] jeopardizes affects academic work personal life. owes us apology."" even apologized Dr. Fauci repeatedly sidelining undermining him? apologized state local leadership flippant tweets support opening early? apologized American people modeling mask compliance? parks closed, Lyn visiting twice week; part job Disney blogger Instagrammer

And no, 99.9% people danger. well cougher hopefully gets punished appropriately all, jesus fucking christ... 

imagine compromised immune system, actively treated cancerous tumor, deciding go pier one imports florida places. literally anything worth risk. people fucking insane. new phase widespread may wear mask indoors soon ...‚Äù Fauci said last week seeing signs surge COVID-19 cases could peaking South West areas cusp new outbreaks. states consider pausing rolling back reopening efforts, though necessarily need revert full lockdown, said.‚Äù ... guess say ""delusional"" instead American theres big overlap can't blame mistaken. Source? one worker owned-business goes that's indictment types businesses, single-owner board-owned business goes that's failure one business. That's source. seems like would much different removed option bonds. judge would choose stay jail not. would likely biased keep poor jail don‚Äôt see removing bonds fixes system. Right? I'd imagine depends pitchin' catchin'... population does, like society function honor system, every society crime. law enforcement exist.

The irony America like Americans believe freedom mych reject enforcement, believe police enforce curfews protection slave owners statues joking, like cat food depending get made, probably healthier fast food places burgers/fries. need mask? seen numbers last weeks? Cases coming down. looks like trending right direction. 

Yeah botched reopening soon hopefully beginning getting control. weekend deaths get recorded subsequently.

That mentioned already here, 11 replies so. accurate tally NYT article (which can't reposted despite updates) albeit bit date. Honestly, thank service. wasn‚Äôt meant straw man. expression jaded frustration anti-maskers sovereign citizen types. 

I don‚Äôt really want violence... people‚Äôs ideas single minded unshakable ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù reason, believe conspiracy theories.

If Muslim terrorist stood threatened blow (or spread biological weapons) believed establishment global caliphate taking fast train paradise, defence violence would reasonable.

These people justify stand ground federally seized cows come home, victim people tolerate endangerment themselves.

Particularly case endangerment positive action.

These people danger society, idiotic ideology spreading. necessarily. 0.3% dying, ill take chances Unhappy cake day you. true, generally speaking vaccination safe. also true vaccines harmed people... opinion verifyable fact. find odd reasonable act questions upsets people enough downvote. Anything less blind acceptance frowned upon. Even scientists work fields related disease vaccination point vaccine may protect 6 months 2 years back drawing board. admit openly ""magic bullet"" means dare person legitimate reason ask questions. Whatever, downvote want welcome it.

To answer question, consider mercury thimerisol extremely toxic dangerous ""far safe"" concoctions known cause autism unsafe well. Covid hoax, wasn't. Even according source, referring intrinsically toxic, isn‚Äôt. 

The phrase serves useful purpose, alienate demean. thread fine actually expressed nuance someone saw fit drag level encapsulative dismissal. actually made snork. nice one. guhs. thing college‚Äôs. Millionaires fear loosing millions, loose lives. Watch someone die. watch struggle alcoholism lose battle. hope death finally find peace always escaped here. wish rest peace. given frontrunners already production aiming delivery end year. get 5 years ? face look like photoshopped someone else's head? still choice take proper precautions others.

Edit

At point ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know‚Äù excuse doesn‚Äôt fly anymore know stops cough? good ole‚Äô throat punch. Holy shit. hope you‚Äôre safe healthy. sucks. Yeah, idiot supervisor one people ""heroically"" comes work sick, came scarlet fever insisted working strep throat. Even got scarlet fever, merely graduated working home. infuriating work people like that. anyway, yes. definitely still get scarlet fever. translate number, yes/no? definitely herd immunity I've read. NYC would tens thousands deaths case Username checks out. who's party this? Everyone social media keeping big secret people need proof crazy, followers stick matter 45k unaccounted 180k excess death \~33% higher.

2 divied 7 \~0.29

Here's thought then, maybe death stop weekends, maybe wait next week report weekend death, maybe they're recording death weekends.

Also, nobody's going mention Fox News reporting this? Hope doesn‚Äôt virus sure fuck hope gets I‚Äôm teacher I‚Äôm (personally, head) predicting in-person school entire upcoming year. think start turn 4th quarter we‚Äôll back 1st quarter next year.

However, complete speculation going support follow scientists. say believe. trust medical professionals. I? context I‚Äôm dumbass. 

Listen. To. Experts. left wing indoctrination, we're honest. common? easier indoctrinate extremism kids actually taught think ideas evidence science etc. ever said one else texas here? offer medical advice? fuck talking about? I'm talking about. Yall crazy. Spanish here. mother friend coronavirus (tested positive, ingressed pneumonia hospital) 2 months it, lost lot hair. didnt know maybe coronavirus think possible. Lol. absolutely terrible argument Elon musk‚Äôs IQ. Looks like baited pretty good. groups thousands throughout country least 100 different places Italians locking people put people risk?

Edit: Italians locking people tested positive broke lockdown rules here. However, would count self defense? stiff breeze would probably killed him. need 3 new organs 6 picture health. understand groups live together right? ""**five easy things one try turn curve around enter fall** we're really low baseline,"" Fauci said. handful actions, know experience, help blunt resurgences prevent new ones occurring, said. first consistent ‚Äî correct ‚Äî wearing masks. Studies shown masks work prevent disease spread. example, visualization showed without mask, droplets coughing could travel 12 feet (3.7 meters) masks limit distance, sometimes inches, according previous Live Science second third avoiding crowds keeping distances 6 feet (1.8 meters) others, said. fourth staying away bars places people congregate attending functions outdoors rather indoors, said. fifth washing hands. Exactly We've getting wrong since generation X stop now. building AC?

It takes one unmasked asymptomatic teacher ... expected export economy times crisis, noone expects situation remain unchanged though. countries start opening up, production. Home sweet home, it‚Äôs going get lot worse here. Resurgence? virus ever dissipate America? actually saw neurologist cognitive decline set psychometric testing test it. narcolepsy part routine check fatigue/lack focus complaint also found disorder tachycardia could contributing. 

But seeing things like makes wonder really everybody going fatigue mental exhaustion maybe something medical lol. hard tell. definitely get zonked almost nothing days. bet won‚Äôt take week results. Trump ""gosh everyone's get 2day ;_;"" No. police shot person's life basically forfeit unless surrender. anyone shoots anyone killed. Get bum gun. need prisons detention centers send anti-maskers. would less week infect other. Let's see feel freedom then. Lol. Cool man. said 100% true. live texas. dont know anyone even hospitalized. wife nurse. claim one person believes me. Seems like might made up. one spreading actual false information. stupid realize that. Yes, cancel season NFL pay support staff makes football happen every year.

Every police interaction possibility turning complete circus, even cops nothing wrong.

So places cops going looking risk careers municipal fine. funny thing happens society decides villainize law enforcement based shifting nebulous criteria- laws stop getting enforced. watched certain persons ~~'look me'~~ press conference last night. Another ~~informative well thought-out~~ shit show old crap, regurgitated repackaged make look like actually knows what's going on.

Also..... ""Palzma"" hahahahaha even talk trump anymore? hear people compare 2 lot!! Yeah like... got bored change went back boring old normal could be, say California people started taking really seriously everyone knew someone even died COVID. That's kinda problem. Outbreaks regional outbreak live take seriously, even question whether real üòë wear mask, go party, dumb shit. know it, community people start getting sick. Mine fell 24 got Dengue Fever. Doctor said normal get really sick. Flatten damned curve region recently quite lot cases origin unknown untraceable (they usually traveled around Finland). So, they've probably gotten disease asymptomatic people therefore masks could useful. 

I guess one part problem nobody wears want one first would embarrassing. everyone would wear them, would normal. Yeah everyone without mask infect someone one die, obviously means maskless person kills everyone...

Its really way isnt it.

To infect someone infected first place, makes masking uninfected people pretty much useless.

Overwhelming majority people survive covid fine,

There shitload ifs, maybes possibles unmasked person someone dying covid direct connection next impossible make. Nevertheless many people yet wear masks ‚Äòumeruca ‚Äòmurights don‚Äôt think misinformed, much clutching straws. wouldn‚Äôt say forced since many kids option research things internet. Happy birthday Mom. Hope shared good birthday memories better times. Thanks sharing. everyone infected focus deliver people severe symptoms first move vaccinate found asymptomatic. rest world eventually slowly get vaccinated well within years now. national plan. 

Basically peasants go back work, rich stays home watch stock market rise back labor (as well trillions Fed pumping stock market future tax payers repay).

If die, it, important. important people ones getting sick. really. slight increase mean second wave. all, know expect prepared signals indicate second wave. 

We're far that. majority indicators show good results.

Nothing wrong actually. liver still works. gotten new one I'd home anyway. can, going tremendously bad. hope follow Governor Cuomo NY. Many hated he‚Äôs turned hearts around way he‚Äôs handled Covid outbreak part. stated he‚Äôs going go saving lives protecting political career. size US GDP makes USA superpower. dropping like rock. Dangerousness evaluated apart cash bond issue. judge order someone held without bond based danger public. Cash bond prevents poor people going free, dangerous people. Look LORD Jesus Christ, see resurrection actually wouldn‚Äôt surprised all. Russia‚Äôs already preparing they‚Äôre going get useful American idiots start calling russian vaccine. attempted murder. CDC's ""excess death"" calculations exclusively looking known COVID 19 comorbidities. explicitly avoid looking things likely irrelevant, external injuries. Despite months prepare, examples set New York/New Jersey, despite evidence have, states still dropped ball. 

It's probably time vote politicians call neighbors. Dumbo! needs international prison put executives politicians made worse though greed.

I'm sick right thing selfish assholes world best keep going. really liked guy alot beginning constant changing opinions things really matter alot make wonder pulling strings. definitely think bad fall well seems No, meant comment responded to. pointed American thought clear seeing original comment. There, is, speak way taking original comment distinctly American fashion think commenting captured quite well implicit fashion. 

I would take issue someone else commented ‚Äú#someothercountry‚Äù made sense them. think agree later point‚ÄîI saying clear distinctly american way original statement could taken. Ok, mistake. Guess read wrong trying predict while. first thought would come waves, seems like behaving like Influenza virus, like coronavirus. 

That's great news winter, since 4 common Coronaviruses peak December January. data readily available coronaviruses disease prevalence throughout year.

I would like think horrible wave going worst one. month worst month virus subside. one knows, evidence point December/January rough coronavirus infections general. Pier 1 ain‚Äôt it.  I‚Äôll upvote ass  work guy like that, kids...doesn‚Äôt want kids goes Disney honeymoon. economy care 30% drop GDP? economy also fine mass unemployment?

The stock market reflects companies stock market. says nothing small businesses, even there. small businesses go bust many, many people unemployed, big problem country.  Alabama- least heathy state, save Mississippi. 

The virus may move slowly compared New York population density, really doubt death toll per capita going look better there, said done. South Korea population density greater New York State cases coronavirus New York. 

New York death per capita coronavirus 1,680 per 1,000,000 people. 

Alabama's 330 per 1,000,000 people.

South Korea's 6 per want never employed easier ways it. Take time really build callouses up. Make Toph proud. discuss summer camp outbreak? schools opened day two closing?

Hmmm great idea. moron sheriffs didn‚Äôt think this? surprise. ceasing, people come indoors south summer, hence spread. happen north winter quick, saliva-based test. Students staff get results usually within 5 hours. Seems workable me. Good them. It‚Äôs reason people dismissive ADHD. Everyone experiences symptoms sometimes it‚Äôs big deal don‚Äôt accept debilitating experience time Cash bonds probably fraction makes countries think US bizarre.

People definitely breaking rules. Why? sure. enforcement rules lacking people either got bored stopped taking seriously. Theres that, choice well. pride, greed. making everything life religion stay loyal to, rather recognizing everything belief denial doesnt stop bad things happening. dont like someone says doesnt make enemy. like...a lack maturity, growing society encouraged kind mindset everything fight doesnt mean no, means push harder ""persistent"" ""assertive"" get want, ideas twisted aggressive stubborn unrelenting. one knows let go open anything thats ""religon"". dont know separate mindset religion, devotion, stubborn faith appropriate degree actual religion real life, politics. use critical thinking skills used like weapon, view things like war like need defensive offensive.

Others willing take jobs.  wish could provide sense assurance okay. obviously can't that. hope situation stabilizes. scary, know. lost close friend it. mask ride storm.

One scary aspect much denial we're seeing. Even states like ravaged right now. president, people follow numbers assume media hype conspiracy, refuse simply wear fucking mask. really sobering. honestly never thought human stupidity widespread pervasive. heavily erodes ability optimistic.

The mask wearing crucial point. foolproof cut back risk quite lot, people comply control this.

Best wishes. Depends country. sent kids back school back june finish school year, see much increase cases. eat lunch desk, sitting separated clean hands regularly. teachers wear masks think. 
But stuff pretty much control begin with, low amount cases. yeah, get country control, sending kids back school OK done appropriately. problem US lot countries far ""under control"" still want send kids school. CCP full shit. People PhDs sciences, arguable peak critical thought, still believe dumb conspiracies. cannot educate away willful ignorance.  Again, since answered question all, would Obama done differently keep covid US? side note, honestly think single world leader entire planet listened scientists covid every single country? C'mon man, least put effort little research craft creative insult you. come back weak rehashed cliche.

Did disease ridden chode spread brain? Try harder. studies deny children spreaders rely contract tracing, usually small specific sample sizes. 

That's flawed method young children unlikely (especially schools day cares closed) ever without either parents teachers. cannot index cases simply THAT, can't spread it. 

But even so, found large, good study contact tracing shows index cases. 

So two things: index cases, adult-level (or higher) viral loads. 

There reason, none, zip, nada reason think available evidence can't spread adults, history medicine contagious respiratory diseases also shows children also spread stuff adults do. deserved it. right. said virus can, implying already Oh, be. cheap they'll say work. change discussed here? Better dead maximum capitalists than.....cautious capitalist social democracies?  I'm saying media ideological slant tends hire run op eds aligned branding (ideological slants).

The Atlantic robust history run articles talk woes deregulation, bombing good, case labor rights/unions.

This article aligns large number articles vein. point clarification, soap kill viruses bacteria. Instead facilitates removal surfaces (including hands). Since non-disinfecting wipes really suds would expect super effective larger surface areas. 

Think way, takes 30 seconds soaping properly wash hands. surfaces need give equivalent amount soap scrubbing effective. 

People also tend use disinfecting products correctly, disinfectant needs surface ~5 min (exact time depends concentrations identities disinfectant). quick wipe spritz doorknob stays wet &lt;1 min really disinfecting surface. would completely insane believe massive unprecedented drop cases related Tru p taking data. sad reality lot people country insane, sending kids school right now. Yikes! problem article it‚Äôs using early 20th century language understanding describe syndrome far complex nuanced understanding today. understand brain damage caused encephalitis lethargica impulsivity hypersexuality often result disease. author would rather write it‚Äôs inexplicable terrifying mysterious ness. author also seems think there‚Äôs sort barrier mind brain, oooooh, scary disease pass one other. mind-body dichotomy long debunked there‚Äôs need refer fashion. Thank brother. school district remote town hall today. People looking get kids back ASAP. unfathomable. care less. want someone watch kids that's care kids die this? Provide case happened virus. flew two different places flight? would they? Families allowed visit. Patients? They're sick care believe not. nothing prove you. plenty people - spoke - sick crippled them, bad enough get hospitalized. People still bury head sand. Mostly agree, educators [mis-educated quite now. valid claim say reopening puts kids risk, evidence suggests doesn't. 

I'm sure talking point coming I'm seeing lot going get people killed. really freaking hard people sit still year?

It vacation companies can't stand losing revenue quarter, let alone whole year. takeaway ‚Äúif even wearing everything isn‚Äôt always enough, really need trying harder‚Äù ‚Äúoh well, doesn‚Äôt work, fuck it‚Äù.

Plenty coworkers didn‚Äôt get - unlucky. PPE works everyone needs follow it. Please tell already know citizen here.

Some us wear masks protect others; abide social distancing (even making mental health take nosedive) practice staying home much possible (again, even mental health suffering).

The problem is, others like cannot control attitudes selfish assholes roam freely, spreading disease mayhem everywhere. like can't expect random retail shop employees enforce mask mandates stores fear getting injured, worse, killed. 

Fuck, even mask shaming work people; selfish are. care themselves. best thing would punish heavy fines possible jail time result adhering mandates, but.. mandates, laws find many police officers officials enforce them.. enough manpower actually enforce them. moron too?  think means ignorant. AFAIK going class doesn‚Äôt increase decrease IQ. good thing congress working extra hard making sure nobody accidentally gets extra bucks they're forced unemployment.

/s...obviously Catholic countries tend catholic holidays top state holidays, less evens out, usually one holidays fall saturday sunday wont able get free time following monday less state holidays. first may national holiday state holidays rest catholic ones. Companies usually complaim many holidays, reality usually 1-2 per year fall sunday, every 10-15 years weekdays. won't. Prepare virtual again. sounds like conspiracy, really, takes willful neglect mismanagement, like air traffic controller duty intentionally. 

I know Hanlon's attribute malice adequately explained stupidity.

She‚Äôs wallowing sympathy self-importance; that‚Äôd crazy! think going reduced influenza year mask wearing social distancing.

We're also going see fewer flu hospitalizations lot people would hospitalized dead already. COVID really hit weakest part population hard. didn‚Äôt know taking real statistics account rather anecdotes means lack empathy.

Thailand 69 million people, 3000 cases, 58 deaths 

Every East / Southeast Asian countries outperformed Latin American countries. asking ' Ecuador done China curb virus?' not, Ecuador low death rate. fine ridiculously small non-withstanding, NFL nice guys care much, risk life performance one players, that's massive investment gone, invested one player whole team also risk infection whose performance unit suffer relied player there.

Quite frankly, them, I'd give much, much larger penalty even first time offenses. Oof wonder Mr Sippi feels Christ man get grip. said THOUGHT supported circumstantial evidence. responded anything disproving got offended.

Feminists really threw away great deal. also made impossible support oneself alone without marriage.

By trying make women independent making rely men income thus forcing marriage, still forced marriage even work yet still rely men financially. 

If man could marry woman make money go work every day watch kids, keep house, laundry, buy groceries, cook meals, socially acceptable, socially encourage expected, I'd thrilled. Even fear mongering, believe 100%. manic depression I'm fighting covid rn. I'm pretty good handling manic depression.

Well, old either, like said it, high chances dying go out. people high chances dying even stay home time. even terminally ill people today locked homes told would die next months.

I'm disagreeing fact going still stupid idea, want highlight fact definitely people rightfully mad sit still year pretty expected outcome (specially selfish people prefer go case last year risk infecting killing god knows many people). let sort anything, click heading arrows. first one falls category yet knowing whether extent carrying makes child contagious. change anything already knew.

The second among strongest evidence date favor contagiousbess, frankly I'm still trying learn make sense it. concern seems based correlation rather firm causation. put another way, contacts children likely get necessarily mean got child. Hospitalization numbers supposed fall hospitals become filled resources taxed (you can't hospitalization admit sent home). plateau whatever discharge rate + death rate (or admission rate). Pretty much one part system becomes unreliable backlogged, unreliable show plateau downward trend. 

Arizona exceeded covid ICU capacity July 22 coincidentally, deaths began plateau downward trend. Hospitalization Covid 19 (non ICU) still rise, albeit slower rate before. 

 Americans dumb alive long. Shut loser go disinfect eyeballs mentioned it, actually started wondering something. read schizophrenia happens body/person becomes stressed out, second stress hormone begins permanently triggered. stress, first epinephrine triggered remain stressed longer, adrenocorticotropic triggered second stress hormone found permanently triggering patients schizophrenia. completely healthy people stressed badly triggers appearance psychosis without abnormal childhood upbringing, genetic predisposition response, permanently schizophrenic patients permanent brain-response releasing adrenocorticotropic stuff. Perhaps truly peaceful experiences like calm unstressed life, combined habits meditation could actually make something difference. mean, many people suffer schizophrenia claim helps lot hobbies art painting, *too* far fetched speculate it. ""The United States wrong"" Source majority people wearing masks? whole ""you're tired kids want dump someone else"" repeated sub? People like really live bubble. real world families require two paychecks survive luxury working home. 

The reality one coming save us essential workers provide family. cannot take time off. / option. People preach want things government help reality shit happening. instead opening right way let floodgates lose say fuck it?
Not good plan ironic think empathetic telling others think.

I advocate freedom choice true empathy. Empathy lets another life long directly infringe upon mine. Viruses always existed always exist. Demanding total compliance everyone utopian insane. Authoritarian.

I wouldn‚Äôt get someone‚Äôs face confront chose wear mask, would distance them.

All people white knighting mask stuff opposite. Indulging savior ego. one afraid virus push fear onto others try control them. Keep safe. Everything going fine, shit exaggerated agenda. Sure:

First thing underlying conditions latest COVID-19 death Hamilton Hamilton County Health Department says child age bracket birth 10-years old died COVID-19. mental gymnastics phenomenal. Bravo ;-) Queue run Clorox wipes generation kids many lost parents pandemic foolishness incompetence; educators literally telling kids respect science, research education goes along it. It‚Äôs pathetic protest Berlin corona restrictions. wear mask keep two meters apart. end police dissolved protest protesters comply rules demonstration allowed. police also pressed criminal charges organizers.

If everybody conscious virus, wears masks, observes social distancing rules, probably minimize spread, especially outside. expect behavior virus deniers anti-mask people. anyone would like hire remote-learning physics teacher please DM me. Exactly one become part pod? great references play nicely others. grandmother 8 children (+2 sets stillborn twins). grandparent's case really wanted girl. But, yes, back far common huge families. Radiolab brainlets think smart people listen to. pulp entertainment, nothing more. behaviour incomprehensible cancer patient Pier 1 pandemic???? end happened still cancer, mom would‚Äôve beaten fuck Teachers choice go work too...

Some people work pay bills. teachers feel like dont choice, way parents feel like dont choice.

This clear cut would like believe. mental illness problem US really really bad. said one insanely idiotic things ever heard. point rambling, incoherent response even close anything could considered rational thought. Everyone room dumber listened it. agree much this, feel like shoes biggest thing. one ever wear shoes right, getting right fit used actual job shoe stores. Unfortunately me, wear 16/17 depending brand freaking one carries store. Way go Florida, killin it. Italy led coalition incoherently populist antivax morons M5S far-right Lega. Naturally, even worse Trump.  Similarly, worked sporting goods store customer tried return C9 Champion clothing. explained multiple times C9 Champion Target exclusive line. Evidently also sold Champion clothing take back, despite system all.... Yeah assholes putting anti mask billboards eastern Washington saying freedom cure lady getting rid mask. New Jersey native.

All need know. Nope fcktard jk jk...its gonna get better future tho good top scientist working cures medicine lots people like following protocol America good hope familia good hope fellow redditors bueno ...but something can't shake tho said money going value ? can't understand anybody sane could get cruise ship times. safer holiday activity could enjoy? got covid 22 days ago tested positive 4 days ago. Since I‚Äôve isolated girlfriend last weeks move apart close contact 3 days didn‚Äôt know, continued way. Could possibly keep transmitting eachother virus never get negative long keep contact isolate other? Take look lot pro athletes end lives, especially people color. pretty much middle class, that. wrestlers, instance, downright broke.  ITT: thinly veiled wishes Desantis gets sick dies. everyone else becomes doomer like them. 

What really happen: couple people mildly sick walk away reinforced beliefs it‚Äôs much bad flu season actual PCR test probably hour tops. paperwork along tens thousands samples also tested ensuring samples mixed contaminated makes average time super long. said, things could definitely sped tricks like pooling samples testing sample pool positive, etc. university test staff students, turnover could little faster things.  try make feel better. distraction meant catching Ebola (which contagious unless you‚Äôre leaking fluids.. danger healthcare workers people bury bodies)

There Ebola outbreak earlier year.. another virus never go away bc deforestation people close  stick established brands. They're little harder find, they're there. Germ-x equate frequently available Walmart. equate stuff excellent inexpensive. Germ-x also quite good also reasonable.
 
If come across green equate, BUY IT. best sanitizer I've ever used, ""sticky"", leaves hands nicely moisturized. clear equate almost good, little bit funky scent. scent go away soon fully dries though. $753.0000 (four 0s enough?) decisions make based keeping position actually want solve problem. used someone‚Äôs son, brother, grandson, cousin, friend, playmate. gone forever. Honestly, I‚Äôm kind hot head. person deliberately coughed me, would swung her. don‚Äôt think picks large men pull bullshit though, mothers 10. Depends entirely circumstances. plenty people may well $700,000. others, may well 75¬¢. aware too. Everywhere adhered masks social distancing really crushed curve, either masks offer significant protection airborne COVID, airborne covid rare normal circumstances need respirator filter airborne COVID. That‚Äôll lead people hide symptoms therefore infect ppl. People skills thing reason. Ridiculous. replying question ""don't (they) still fund public schools property tax"" money going vouchers funding public schools. Also true. Adults super Disney super creepy me. one poor can't find face covering wear.  wearing one choice need kept away society.  people standing way dealing virus effectively. stop. I‚Äôm Disney fan too, cry every time get there....but I‚Äôve bought Disney merch made Disney food listening Disney music, safely home. things wait. demand pro football may diminish parents start putting kids sports. consider rise esports whole pandemic thing. longer vaccine takes get distributed world, likely society socializing change. countries experiencing mass death like US already restarted things like soccer leagues. US sports fans might get sucked new interests  better lol prepared curb stomp someone 100% better shooting they're still standing.

Stomping someone's head foot they're already downed could reasoned self defense, likely long term damaging shot center mass Lol. That's real smooth-brain take there, brosef. Oh please, need move here. every country moving clearly well. There's reason able mass gatherings people wearing masks. make reference mass right may hear mass amounts reinfection. Guess what? School starting month.

Those Germans words lot things. German word 'claiming done something, immediately it'?

Verschlimmbessern close, quite right... swear people need get dumb ass beat. Pretending it‚Äôs flu spreading misinformation. *zap* Cause informed scientist making guesses. mom saying shit Facebook 80% masks work Americans care. love, mean **LOVE** mass incarceration; say y'all think poorly us. facade gets dropped second judge makes mistake trying sentencing someone life behind bars; outrage taking schadenfreude us absolutely immense. buy like Hertz auto sales dealership sells old rentals? Mine either little pissed. Yes two states, North Dakota Wyoming, well citizens still gathering. least 8 10 1 place..at time less!! sounds like several.of kids adopted. judge sets bail amount either florida judge new jersey judge yeah racism probably would make difference    He's helped propagate ideology antithetical pretty much everything hold dear right, comment uncalled for.

edit: or, looking post history likely literal. still take back :) Yeah, I'm overreacting here. assumed people cautious end wearing masks. really know airborne transmissions work. still go way much there. Quite people seem think required study. August like, ""Hold mask."" people putting others danger.  I'm favor anything prevents so. Paying state order released prison. even ask says much Please give 2020 new ideas. Hi, picking kid school.

Sir, child enrolled school.

But teach curriculum. Give different kid then. Don‚Äôt dare think NJ gets easy Mother 10??? why, exactly? I've seen people get killed shit like justified gun owners time. virus laughing matter, lethal force met lethal force. see problem using guns defend yourself, that's fine viewpoint, I'm sure selectively chose wrong defend situation. wonder why? released ... I‚Äôm assuming mostly first time offenders get . **direct** value protecting people infectious yet aware.

However even infected seen others generates kind social permission pressure encourages others so, benefit indirectly.

Because exponential spread unchecked virus far value overall one individual wearing mask could create own. see cancer patient makes assult matters state state living states places shitty testing times. saw PBS video last night thought interesting easy understand. Maybe could help too. another recent video masks well. people sign lives completely shut infinite amount time. permanent solution forthcoming, increasing data showing majority people serious bad flu, people willing take risk. shut country every flu season, all. 

Passing vulnerable populations concern ultimately need take precautions, including staying isolated. Asking society pause indefinitely save nation's grandparents make lot sense matter look it. gotcha. Yeah careful words‚Äî fiasco wasn‚Äôt great word choice. 

I expect big day week though add backlog on‚Äî put week worth really low numbers in, I‚Äôll suspicious! Haha. ""In June"" completel useless stat since different places hit different times. Give total number february end July number pointless  I‚Äôm one usually criticize donations billionaires. people get hung ‚Äúit‚Äôs 0.000001% net worth!!‚Äù

But case, defeats purpose ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù income program. numbers don‚Äôt add up. $500 monthly 500 people year clearly isn‚Äôt sustainable ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù future cash have. think get funding cities? Jack expected donate another $3M every year cities? full paycheck American. Finally got pay raise today months promised one. I'd screwed bond. Creed iron lung Yo. heart droped saw child following out. Hopefully CPS sees this.  works ,they can‚Äôt increase bail based skin color gender . professional bumfights also transmit via eyes. HCW it.

Apparently sit around day government throw money you, guess working afflicted pandemic gets cheap applause... bet folks seen anyone Covid still young enough think they're invincible. new phase? mean first phase? great! Makes day! want us closed forever? goal always reopen 100% soon humanly possible. Also, thats pretty shifty want friend good wedding day, hood pushing stopping life fear. likely everyone attending perfectly fine wedding go without issues.  Technically, no, P100 goggles good going get. really doubt it, dude made Teflon. supporters ever back think it‚Äôs skin pigment blocks sunlight we‚Äôd naturally soak outdoors. reason don‚Äôt age quickly races. 

Edit:

Took last sentence article posted literally says this. great price 40 bucks world traveler. I'm lucky make local coffee shop month, I'm going pass this. Congrats man. Maybe cut brakes lines morning. Maybe send poison apples. never hurts ask sorry bail supposed crimes = slavery ? Ah, yeah.

I referring people though.

I referring people think covid joke, wear mask, get vaccine.

Probably not, untrue.

That said, US largest foreign aid contributor worldwide, significant margin.  Yeah, wondering that. went 10k - 11k cases day, rising, suddenly half past days. ): judging behavior people live, it‚Äôs gonna bad while. Ugh. OMG bleach alcohol poured paper towel ziplock...hello?

The South's motto right talking cases deaths? Cases going bit week. two Arizonas US?

Or talking one almost many deaths past seven days whole EU put together? Possibly, though think De Blasio's NYC fiasco going nearly impossible catch to.

Rural areas though big issue ohio. cities suburbs part, rural areas getting worse Oh, think care denial bad it'll be. local outbreaks registered pretty quickly detained.

Actual mortality rate much lower statistics.  I'm insinuating anything. United States great summer: 

15 January - 1 case

April 28 - 1 million cases (103 days later)

June 10 - 2 million cases (43 days later)

July 8 - 3 million cases (28 days later)

July 23 - 4 million cases (15 days later) 

Aug 4 - 4.7 million cases (12 days later)  I've always thought really matter anyways. Unless conducting illegal acts they'd reason track down, use information. like government employee room home, *I want look 138-22-3169 listening recently Google Home*. 

Now, think morally correct so? No, everyone right privacy, invite homes, goes hand hand. basing entire nation stereotypes? Great need. hear FOX going. See people made up. libs nust want schools close. There's problem whatsoever. Arggg Sure Jan. Actually has. I'd like ask check links posted. welcome searching. 

If find anything disputes virus mutated, scientists around world actively tracking various strains.... Find something, anything, refutes this. even smidge evidence. venmo, PayPal, mail fresh $20. 

There six strains. biologically distinct, due ongoing mutations. 

I'm standing by.  kidding $20. admit I'm wrong showed evidence, happy tdo so.  Plus, twenty bucks fun social experiment.  Let's go! Getting 50 people agree anything hard, especially 1/3 total disagreement 2/3. needs federal national response COVID, virus doesn‚Äôt care state pay taxes to. Look successful countries containing COVID. don‚Äôt see South Korea delegating decision making individual provinces national government sits around nothing. work College MA. private liberal arts College anyone campus fall semester tested every 3 days twice week. Anyone currently working campus already getting tested week.

The college hired outside company testing currently takes 1.5 days get results. results 3rd test tonight.

Portland 62 days continuous protest cases per capita 5x higher Florida, wait, it‚Äôs exact opposite Sort of. completely believe different places need different strategies, like little city Kansas might need complete lockdown like NYC might population density super low even public transportation. But, start leaving much decided local level, get dumbasses totally ignore it. example governor made masks mandatory left local official decide enforce it, voted enforce it. stated many Doctors abroad effective. given outset might think magic indeed...‚Äù wrote one given day test came back,‚Äù Fine replied. ‚ÄúSorry burst magic on, netizens commented surely Fine must taking drug ‚Äúas prescribed‚Äù following ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù (there none established medical authority).

I'm guessing someone yelled work without zinc and/or azithromycin. Even though August super basic drugs worked COVID19 we'd know it. muh freedumb! Yes do, conspiracy theories discredited China yet people still believe them, much like elsewhere. heart disease. ban bacon? false notion sides issue deserved equal credence. explain haha live Georgia confirm. care. still either overblown hoax. really dark horrible part would say ‚ÄúGood, get serious complication die COVID exit gene pool‚Äù,

Too bad can‚Äôt even wish upon virus also affects responsible / innocent people

They‚Äôre like drunk drivers, they‚Äôre gonna take someone else idioticness uhh, I'm non-traditional student works full time. supposed quit job quit school? friend signed Moderna told 50/50... know different mRNA vaccine one never approved use yet. placebo trials controversial? thought standard science. challenge trial certainly ethically questionable know those. lol.....China, fully lockdown full mega-cities, conduct mass testing contact tracing couple hundred cases, exactly US... sad prevalent. need EU, Korea, Japan, Taiwan do, make education intelligence held high esteem. Meanwhile intelligence mocked like said, smh. 

My glass-half-full view covid, kids idiots see anti-intellectualism bad science good. see idiot parents changing. Whatever Megamind. /s

Lol. God that‚Äôs atrocious. Former boss used live Alabama couldn‚Äôt wait get out. Yup. going say thing. Someone protest sign said want send kids back school listen educated? sadly that's valid question country. Covid much new virus new transmission vectors well understood outset. sounds like one agenda. United States isn‚Äôt anything...how could wrong? Seriously, deflecting responsibilities onto local governments makes easy people companies employ pressure local school boards open economic reasons anything. 

Now we‚Äôre hearing new info kids actually spreading virus much higher levels, lots school staff getting virus in-service days, student pro athletic groups getting virus, might actually see lot schools go online simply can‚Äôt maintain consistent staff way.

A lot teachers currently playing chicken waiting hear school‚Äôs reopening plan be, hoping online, drawing personal line sand resign- face job possibly pay fine bailing last minute, losing teaching license. 

Child development important, argument really smokescreen argument economy, parents needing childcare, kids fed. Plenty people send kids shitty schools without anyone giving damn development. 

The path might fit 13 years school. might require extra half full year kids moving forward recoup developmental gains lost. Same. school enforcing providing masks students faculty, classes already moved online semester. school changing classes different locations campus allow social distancing class, making students living campus get tested move in, set dorm floors student needs quarantine. One courses conference hall football stadium, going basketball arena class. school absolute best I‚Äôm grateful much care still nervous 20,000+ students start campus again. It‚Äôs gonna bad. Damn!! Called stupid work school opened doors week. It‚Äôs fairly rural area hit hard yet. kids don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù believe yet personally affected Covid. going change soon. I‚Äôve paying way attention numbers coming state/county health dept. rather feds. 100% think vaccine come soon next month say time, think misinterpreted said. trying say vaccine comes, doubt US going absolutely nothing ""Retarded"" might word looking for. they? I'm awake. happening, especially open economy work money instead getting government. keeps going world become unrecognizable. We've worse without shutting economy, social distancing, wearing masks. Accurate numbers show time, people find really happened, right, need improve. Psychopath* test Trump everyday? can‚Äôt imagine submitting test once. live town??  Crying child entering frame!!!! Omg. Gtfo. ridiculous.  4th group.  group feel for.  social safety net. cutting it. look state numbers national numbers. I‚Äôve paying way attention numbers coming state/county health dept. rather feds. less 10 second search two states widely talked atm. read articles? no, it‚Äôs 3 millions. kids didn‚Äôt die COVID, doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt feel lasting effects. what, screw kids underlying condition? isn‚Äôt even touching teachers staff family members kids also bring virus home to. yeah, don‚Äôt go pick kindergartener playground bury economy. kids die this. fact controlling community spread US unwillingness enforce adherence science. would remind happened Israel. school follow mask protocol, almost 200 children tested positive, 20 teachers tested positive. number ballooned 800 infected teachers students schools closed again. America millions cases decided reopen. 

Children magically immune. get virus, dangerous adults, absolutely carried back home. give elderly risk individual, especially comorbidities like Diabetes Hypertension, disease quite bit dangerous them. mind taking risk, power you. There's nothing say change mind.

Edit : keep claiming ""consistent"" agree science schools need open. read AAP guidelines well, mentioned clearly schools reopened provided children teachers maintain 3 6 feet distance, masks effective controlling spread.

If consistent, agree fact we've already seen two requisites reopening fail. Children socially distancing, wearing masks. view this, guidelines put forward AAP would disqualify school reopening. 

The whole reason Israel failed reopening schools failed follow two requisites well. Reddit asserting since schools reopened here. regular-type class never work thing high level circulation. Someone gets it, 2-3 week (because calandar days vs. school weeks) quarantines everyone. Clear? Okay, someone else gets next week back.

Lunch room outbreak spreads three kids different classes? three classes exposed. quarantine.

It's disruptive make classes useless.

The applies non-bubble team sports. believe that's one reason happening, open eyes change! think people country scarificed economy sickening! We've got bad stuff going around world. stick together, us citizens let people running country allowed us, power make change. see needs happen, let's come election day. think, look already us, want another 4 years? hope people NOT, send kids school virus. madman running country, like said people dying, well, is????? expendable. We've shown. Yep. keep going rest article bub.  know. ""we see steady linear growth reach 100-150 cases day August."" quite happen ofc situation worse 3 weeks ago. federal government gonna shit time would buy. There's point. Lol we‚Äôre fucked Oklahoma Around grew up, HS teachers averaged would $100k adjusted slightly inflation. city live now, first year teacher bachelors would make minimum $58.5k year starting would guaranteed $72k year 5 assuming masters degree. average district course higher, 'average' years experience teachers 1-5 years. 

The LOWEST ranking state terms average teacher pay (unsurprisingly, Mississippi) \~46k 2020. I'm doubting anecdote, people downvoting u/MisanthropeX citing $ amount teachers pay example literally national average providing number objectively outlier? ridiculous sat claiming average teacher made $100k that's made grew (was low CoL area BTW). sort hangup teachers exact compensation, make exact original argument mentioned taking majority white collar jobs. Bull shit. way determine works RCT, every single one shown significant effect mortality duration symptoms. vast majority people survive COVID, people surviving aunt's care indicative efficacy. 

Ivermectin, another cheap, non-patented drug, actually RCT (pre print) showing efficacy. I'll wait peer review larger trial get excited, surprised much less hype around compared HCQ. least objective evidence favor ivermectin. Lead Paragraphs:

Our popular culture country help matters glamorizing violence ignorance. people idolized young people -- hell, many adults -- scientists, teachers intellectuals athletes pop stars who, part, become successful without particular education. And, many glamorize fact: try hard school -- suckers that. kids taught faulty critical thinking, blame bad decisions. kids going live die errors judgement. blame go parents, schools, weakness peer pressure.

What makes leftist? ‚ÄúHe actively using drugs hadn‚Äôt recently convicted crime‚Äù I've seen international commentary, particular US media, touting Australia's early successes failed. would think tone articles virus rampant Australia efforts suppress virus futile.


But reality quite different.


The situation Melbourne, one city albeit Australia's second populous, great. Extreme measures taken government. absolute case numbers remain very, low.


""Going hard going early"" remains successful model. Even Melbourne, lockdown successfully preventing growth numbers measures taken yesterday lead decrease numbers suppression within 6 weeks.


The rest Australia remains almost Covid-free despite several weeks virus Melbourne. Sydney remains consistent around 10-20 cases daily contact tracing keeping control (for now) virus effectively eliminated elsewhere.


The economic impact suppression - includes shutting 70% economy Melbourne 2 months - extreme. less extreme alternatives see elsewhere, largely uncontained viral spread permanent economic drag vaccine developed distributed. hell wrong people! agree, I‚Äôd say saw Pennsylvanians natural state being.

Yeah, Texas reporting biggest factor yesterday‚Äôs lower usual numbers. mostly pointing lots people sub bought conspiracy, along others, Texas hiding numbers yesterday. updated whatever yesterday‚Äôs total accurate inclusion Texas. Sounds like one extremely short tragic stories. fucking whore. US? would say things getting slightly better. reduced otherwise bad state testing makes hard tell sure. reasonable person fear serious bodily harm, allowed use physical force stop threat, America least. So, would guess get pretty easy.  People, need help. 

My family actually thinking going beach next week can't convince go. shit stressing out, fucking BEACH? can't risk going there. think since warm humid, it'll kill virus. mention beaches really thing. guess we're *soo* bored, might well risk getting others sick think they're better virus.

What do? I'm pretty young family members visit us quite often, worse actually there. show evidence protected? I'm way much stress this. really downplay urgency level USA facing

I also think distribution right groups fall cause sense normalcy winter  Booooo, mods gay Yeah that's understand many people came WH staff getting positive cases saying ""Oh I'm sure get tested everyday"". Oh really? Where's source that? obvious weren't. Half NYC test positive. disproven hydroxychloroquine prevent symptomatic infection SARS-CoV-2 exposure unknown.

That direct quote abstract study. point study see save people. That's pretty much subjects young good health. explicit purpose study find whether drug good post exposure **prophylaxis**

You realize prophylaxis is, right? Please tell know, otherwise hell even arguing? get ""death"" subject ""treatment given action taken prevent disease""? damn title, study looking effectiveness HCQ prophylactic drug COVID-19, kind effects death. Also realize fact control group test group 0 deaths actually mean much whether good not, right? means drug outright kill patients themselves. Pepsi, mean finding ""Pepsi kill COVID patients"" positive result supporting use Pepsi postexposure prophylactic drug. literally means ""this drug outright kill really care about?

No, literally not. That's literally point study all. know read title. Sure, goal humanity trying reduce COVID deaths, role study. study tried find whether HCQ good PEP, concludes significant difference use HCQ placebo amount infections reported. support role HCQ effective PEP, effective PEP would much bigger difference rate infection. 

You want know good PEP is? ones used HIV. good PEP like ones HIV reduce infections 2.5% Certainly current one. Sweet! I‚Äôll look around see find!  Another man wear Gotta pay bills somehow.  Man, would punch motherfucker me. Seriously, fuck people. hope gets deserves. many people know Yemen, though? non American, refuse go school? go back mess! brought USA upper limit going worldwide.

I live Melbourne, worry, something look 'horror'. That's sensationalism. entire point vaccination make people immune.

If gonna tell people social distance wear masks getting vaccinated, there's literally point vaccine. Clearly antifa.

/s meant 'in EU'. Context. would wonderful. wish USPS reliable! certainly can‚Äôt not-overly-dramatic woman die we? Stop putting money people!!! Everything isn‚Äôt 100% safe must shut permanently Thanks feedback, considered all!

I think may still apply trial helps research regardless.

Worst case, get placebo, anything wait actual vaccine - best case works. every 3 add ""underlying conditions"", kids one. six eight strains virus.  Scientists world collectively working track it.  Fortunately, strains mutations greatly affect us, though couple supposedly contagious others, small margins. 

Most mutations called neutral, meaning enough us determine lineage various viral dna fingerprints. 

Nothing far makes fiercely deadly.  expect to. Google coronavirus strains.  tons really cool maps scientists around world collaborating real time continually sequence dna detect note mutations. pretty rad. lol beyond ridiculous: masturbate together wearing masks watched video 1918 Pandemic. video made last year could well talking year mistakes repeating. done lady mortician talks like handled massive amount deaths. Part war since men gone war enough man power dig enough graves everyone show pictures stacked caskets. video last year lady like ""Hopefully would back hoes obviously mass grave first choice."" go New York year? Devastating refuse learn careful.

The voters did.

Your post history indicates Bernie.

Polls correct 2016. last two months race tightened.

Clinton popular vote, shows polls ahead right. absolutely false. US 16 deaths kids 18. Go check many die flu buddy. weigh risks complete shutdown partial reopening. look every side make informed decision ignore facts support agenda opposite reality.  ever told truth anything, RINO. definitely ‚Äúthis virus can‚Äù definitely implies has. can't explain judgments illness function associative manner (surgical mask COVID-19) judgments social desirability trustworthiness, may function propositional manner (people wearing surgical mask responsible take new social norms seriously),‚Äù authors say. later add, ‚Äúit might people explicitly say mask-wearers trustworthy socially desirable, implicitly still mistrust feel impulse avoid . . . ‚Äù

My bet ""they wear masks they're weak vulnerable"". Flu also preventable technically. dad sounds like mom. point, needs tinfoil hat. mask Meh. disagree. students make decision, one knows one (US) US system absolutely based performance (apply schools based 9-12 year grades activities).

US students make implicit decisions track based performance (grades), without even knowing it. even US student wants vocation path, path supported current system.

The argument make new, dismissive system works.

The German system clear students make explicit decisions, path go back take different path far accessible US. So... able personally 2022 presume?

With state politics right now, divided parties are, I'm sure would come together war either, unless huge attack US soil like 9/11. Obesity underlying condition. Haha thanks making feel awesome useful. don‚Äôt understand promoting distance learning, time promoting concepts like telework, became political position See Mercury News Article information: 

Additionally, classrooms separated curtains. Shared bathrooms, shared AC, teachers kids district distance learning encouraged bring classrooms can‚Äôt find childcare. kids aren‚Äôt school age teachers can‚Äôt bring campus go places childcare - adding risk exposure. Wow that's even shortsighted 
The new guidance eliminated direct contact CDC hospitals, reversing original mandate issued White House asking hospital administrators send reports coronavirus testing, capacity, utilization patient flow agency daily basis.

Also next I'm disagreeing fact going still stupid idea thoughts gotten much better Sweden. people become careful locking down? Could. Can.  ? imply potential. 

 think meant already has. Thank that, sorry loss

The nurse actually two face masks shield. 20-something year-old girl even wearing mask..  Good point. However little kids don‚Äôt fare well online learning information whether there's correlation mask-wearing/social distancing negative positive tests? mean per person, guesses statistics whole state. Another consideration presumably, teachers contact families, no? 

You potentially going need isolate different ways order teach, still protect others (from yourself) might normally come contact you.

I relatives doctors isolating family/friends order protect them. much fun. Facts time place anymore. need ass kicking Donald Brashear REALLY care reality... all. 

They solely pushing seeing churn money, matter happens actually happening. failure acknowledging reality. Purposely ignoring truth severity, for... money. 

This sickness. reality longer bend follow traditional rules 'looking opportunity... give all... give shot..'

COVID19 kick asses. 

Stop already. Zero second rule Especially now! Dr. Fauci actually ever say ""a pandemic bad time eat floor workplace"" sorta implied. even corona virus someone immunocompromised. disease could kill her. Every cough could bullet. Bu one WH anybody remember [I'm Italian mom coronavirus Yes. said Trump ""listened scientists"" got covid US. ignoring fact every single countryin world covid. apparently every single world leader planet failed listen scientists according you. single country handled correctly. Politicians also held accountable complete lack foresight lack sound decision making. 

If make right decision personally happened them, basically definition qualified make decisions behalf populace. get paid opt out? common cold? flu? Man, get outta here. incorrect. grammar used advanced us. Whaaaaaaat?? Giving education system much credit! two kids Gwinnett school system. stupid confirm fairness English speaking media reporting well either. 

The Swedish approach falsely equated US anything approach. Whereas reality far nuanced. People also seem forget death that's worrying, large number hospitalizations, permanent damage health recovery, also fact virus last months, anyone gets financial trouble since can't work unless job home. lol @ tarantino racism  
he made bruce lee look like shit I'm stopping place, pointing, monotonously screaming maskless people. people join better. solution restrict breathing constantly time? whenever wear feel like need sigh constantly cant suck enough air fast enough... Id rather get sick couple days Keep telling that. Whenever see Ecuador think Seattle got fined $1000 bucks spitting public pandemic. Back like, entire fortune. Wish tough today. Morons article said new NFL player... mean, I'm virtual kids... lot people know can't find way keep job keep kids home. 

Because people, want home can't, I'd feel insensitive making posts shaming parents sending kids school... lot parents talking benefits kids in-person school. 

Messaging- wise, issue, people really hearing downsides one choice (virtual) friends.  Wahh wahh wahh, go rack student loans beg us taxpayers cover terrible decision making. Another overdramatized statement. Fatality rate anyone 20 practically zero. Public pools probably deadly young people covid. saying precautions shouldn‚Äôt taken let‚Äôs properly assess risk instead making dramatic emotionally driven statements. Yeah kids (like elementary age) young stay home themselves.

Maybe 6th graders can...they usually start year 11 yrs old. yep using that, while. seems added per million columns, yay. Thanks! time buy stock company. supply lines things complex one might think. know one brand wipes uses specific plastic strands produced Italy.  God works mysterious ways, amirite There's convincing them.  People dying even phase them.

""What flu, car accidents, seat belts, etc"" C5 Corvette isnt big it?

It 2 seat coupe. old might die soon, okay put others risk? Hint: isn't.

Selfishness selfishness. definitely sticky situation point. Michigan went phase seemed would end like New York, since everyone's concerns gone way down. far less people denying virus refusing masks, time goes infections go people liberal choices. Seeing friends, even taking trips. Theres common rationalization everyone something must ok, get kids wanted go seeing increasing number friends so. understand parents would let kids go saw increasing number friends so. rationalization gives sense safety blinds selfishness.

The idea blame kinda throwing off. difference minimal circumstantial gives fuck. fact matter LOT people fucking make cases like happen. need better looking across board. many parents send kids school anyway flu cold. 


Because access social services safety nets would allow stay home work without risking loss income lead unemployment eviction Oh course Georgia fans. idea never saw exit strategy. Thanks. Ahh world meter added want. Deaths per total population. past. Thanks! dense accepting answer gave fault. answered question. no, every country done right.

But US done horribly horribly wrong every step way, continues again. ""government"" national level failed us, suffering years due it. would actually amazing job, imo. lot schools relying purchasing expensive software keep children engaged, mentor checks kid times week would even better.

The cameras phones solution would dead water jobs, though. I've never boss cool using phone multiple times day. really disturbing none educators want go back school. know people care education. Trump DeVos? Never shown genuine interest education life. want look like country running election comes. care many people die it. resort extortion. starved social contact, whole country takes year school, kids level start things proceed normally healthy. teachers families die Arizona came close capacity July [never dropped 100 available ICU (Click ""Hospital Bed Usage &amp; Availability"")

Click ""Hospital COVID-19 Specific Metrics"" see Covid 19 hospitalizations peaked mid-July fallen since.

Those direct reported numbers, reliable low-resolution IMHE model projections. ill get better, continue wear mask   need rude (Psychopath) would feel safe infection rate drops close zero possible. would send lived Red Zone States. Show State... show way outta here. understand systems exist... looking proof effective bond inducing people show hearing. That's person responding seems claiming. EXACTLY. wouldn‚Äôt even fun went now! working class see human  Luckily postal service operating long time capable delivering mail address country. they‚Äôre able deliver Papa Johns Ashley Furniture flyers every house, add ballot that, too. Good. anything could suggest worse intelligence since going back school suggests get job first time.

And say someone went back school. Back fuck up.

Mother TEN? Good god, dumb. think could also they‚Äôre scared child like show actual human emotions, coping mechanism using masks means feel control situation makes feel like control. couples ‚Äúmanliness‚Äù factor needing look like you‚Äôre strong whatever. Classic new Jersey live city masks mandated midwestern state governor even shut state entire month (but mayor shut us nearly two). full month mandated masks depending look city's health department state's health department (for city's numbers) (which differ VASTLY), case averages roughly 3x number day mandate went effect. So, mean, least mayor cares making difference city seems. I'm apprehensive dying alone hospital leaving children alone. I'll gladly guinea pig. Instead, use data excess death statistics get death count. So... apparently, local news, weird issue numbers? Mobilian here. Heard bit one city health officials. 

We‚Äôre still backlogged hell here. Testing results taking 10 days test centers. SEC LIVE FREE OT DIE FOREVER!!! one people playing 'pick side' game media generally Trump really much left say. experience get rut pretty much stuck forever.

Wow, catch big brain guy! Bethann McLaughlin, founder MeTooSTEM, made fake persona Twitter killed due COVID. bizarre story. NY best provide warnings everyone. within last 3 mo recovered, fine doubt Canada planning drop mandatory 2 week quarantine returning vacationers though. dropped Europe see one US state. part kids transmit teachers, school staff families generally behaving like kids pretty upsetting me. long term damage caused virus still fully understood, patients different age groups report chronic dyspnoea, fatigue side effects related thrombosis months recovery. want put kids go right ahead. 

Plus, elderly individual comorbidities may come contact kids higher risk dying virus. Get yourself, whole world going crisis, schools adapted allowing distance learning means. assure tears lost education worthless compared shed families lost loved ones disease. one, don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs knowledge experience know right solution is. 

But, I‚Äôm willing live social distancing, wearing mask, staying away enclosed public spaces long too. hate it, wish didn‚Äôt to, that‚Äôs do. 

People refusing wear masks take seriously. Kids schools takes one sick students pass around others pass parents, risk people, etc. 

I personally think need vaccine country going crash hard next year. stock market propped long. Jobs aren‚Äôt going magically appear went away. meantime, need wear masks, stay away other, stop acting like ignore Covid it‚Äôll go away. would, 2nd degree found knew infected. certain areas available. Often free significantly less expensive, too. It‚Äôs funny friends one Alabama hospital explained test data goes state department health. hope neglecting social skills, less important ones spending incredible chunk lives school get them. settle move on? going end one way: bad!

Wut Coronavirus control United States way crashing airplane is. They've whipped cult, behavior probably seems valiant them.  tell care. USA 156,594 deaths puts deaths per million 481.... sure got 190k

Edit: source NYT CDC Everyone learns scientific method.

You know one ear saying? That's lot people. stupid take.

NO DEATH EVER ALLOWED LOCK EVERYONE PLASTIC BUBBLES BORN. student going school parent get unemployment help economy recover. longer make stay home take care kids, longer economic suffering be, economic suffering real physical suffering death.

If could reopen schools cost would death single teacher, would heartbeat. question whether enough teachers die offset real benefits.  Yup! various age groups though, think success teens. Well course happen, government supporting citizens deadly global pandemic. Every first world country people going homeless can't work. problem unique US direct result power valuing economy lives. real possibility dozens people every org pitching 3 items coaches GM's getting ignored 1 2 folks actually make decisions.

I've seen enough incompetence know true. Jerry Jones insisted inserting game calling plays fifteen twenty years ago? WTH dude, dozen experts setting complicated, intricate systems, think gut instincts 3rd 5 going help cowboys win? 

It dawned later know teams rebuild sometimes. drafted good Cardinals kicker FF (Neil Rackers maybe?) offense red zone problems year before. Unfortunately me, offense much worse year, kicker saw little action all. teams offense rebuild mode, good kicker makes little sense, spending minimum good prospect probably financially justifiable. 

Good exchange, thanks brain food! :-D Sounds right. I‚Äôve seen way many people argue wearing mask feel inconveniences instead considering benefits us all. what? who's first base? awesome country sure. many us live lives love compassion others. surprised many selfish. nature national identity interests first. convenient, helps interests, we'll help others, smile even. numbers going from? clearly going recent hard hit states (CA, TX, FL, AZ).

New states rise take place, we've gotten population centers first wave point. ""*We tried best limit exposure COVID19 slipped somewhere,*"" says couple traveled California &amp; Georgia pandemic wear masks family gathering. 

Maybe hire Sherlock Holmes crack mystery. ü§î Yes, happened Town Center Fernandina. saying represent certain parts Jax (ahem... westside/northside), referring to. Thankfully Jax huge we're trashy like that...at least us Southside :-) 6 foot rule everyone spouted since beginning COVID arbitrary number based far person could reasonably separate still going normal life (stores, sidewalks, lines, etc.). 

It based false sense securities put people ease, anything scientific regarding actual virus would actually safe.

Yet people get go ""oh 6 feet away, good."" Many proven can't even follow arbitrary 6 foot rule. Amen.

I hope say schools open families food, daycare, mental health services, etc. take note. schools made for. educating. fill cracks society allowed form. mean schools tasked fixing cracks pandemic. 

Government, job figure fix problems educators figure educating kids. lack planning mean put students, teachers, staff risk. obviously joking. guess forget gullible people subreddits.  1st grade tho. completely naive believe teens gonna wake 630 they're supposed online 7 hours home. I'm teen I'm back sleep soon parents leave I'm Poland prime minister said weeks ago (just presidential election) coronavirus going away... 
Also large group saying tht flu jus exist. law also allows wear mask respiratory condition cause issues wearking it, however need prove way... Twisting words fit narrative work here. said was:

""Obama would listened scientists start, something figured wrong needed changed, would've implemented change quickly possible.""

Nowhere statement say word Trump, nowhere say gotten covid. Covid would definitely made shores, people definitely would've gotten sick Obama, key difference actively worked spread disinformation, ignore health experts, act like ""just disappear"". would stood MUCH better chance previous administration, evidenced fact pandemic playbook already available thrown good reason. Texas whole lot issues, system update Way deaths per million Florida though comparison. Cases way lower obviously.


Deaths per million:

Sweden: 574.7

Hard make living dead, sick weeks end Covid. I‚Äôm quoting WH press secretary count population fatality rates, yes, CDC reports pediatric flu deaths, rate per population. see NVSS data set linked above, well CDC's interactive ""FluView"" yes? 

I'm sure adds conversation. accelerate already going happen. 

The real problem come constant 10%+ unemployment automation. Eventually kind UBI required else possible way current economy perpetuate itself.  Replace ‚Äòdirty black people‚Äô point still stands. another article Atlantic. writer 41/m went himself. quite funny, dark cynical pandemic way. lockdown measures bit relaxed travel now. three big things think might effect here.

1/ summer warm sunny Sweden. means people go outdoors, stay indoors. Even distance one safer. People walk bike instead using public transportation year swedes compared years traveling abroad.

2/ summer also peak holidays season. Sweden almost everyone takes least 4 weeks holidays mid-June mid-August. However, mid-August school year starts parents also go back work. government extended recommendations work home everyone schools open also mean congestion public transport. start September time see increase infection levels not.

3/ numbers start go well suddenly. lot people miss fact numbers falling since end April/start May. falling linearly Sweden, decrease reached really low levels. countries time made lockdowns sudden drops Sweden decline seen relatively bad compared those. Europe seeing increase people noticing Swedish current numbers (not totals) looking well comparison. nothing changed Sweden terms measurea. changed rest world. world changed, it'll wise use change it. use private tab. ""Hydroxychloriquine cured me! Give money Trump like saved!"" refuse expect accept bad behavior, makes seem acceptable selfish. tolerate public (everyone see wearing mask wearing wrong loudly called continue so) right endanger others. NONE. Hey...what could go wrong here?  getting pumped up, damn it. Wow sounds like awful policy. They're basically forcing people go work sick. COVID part especially stupid considering turn around time tests, hope stay safe...or find company moronic policy. discover virus originated pro-democracy protestors Hong Kong? workin' hard? Yeah right

It work limited amount time. happens elections interest me.. mean, bad, things get interesting. And, pretend fate related pretty numbers say Indiana ""balanced"" schedule shorter summer break longer breaks school year (2 week fall break, 2 week spring break, etc.) Well, yeah. Contrary beliefs, silent majority usually silent minority. doubt much, based numbers. going enough concentration virus-bearing particles produce infection. crazy. Try calculate.

It‚Äôs easier pretend something doesn‚Äôt exist don‚Äôt want it‚Äôs QUITE directly impacting us. Even president thinks that‚Äôs works: don‚Äôt test sickness isn‚Äôt real. bad us developed object permanence 8 months old so. That's good point, though witnesses/victim violent crime feel like exception There's picture here: http://freelancechristianity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/hB87FB409.jpg Reasonable response: ‚ÄúMan, wearing mask sucks. contact representative protest something.‚Äù

Not reasonable: bringing guns equation. Conventional wisdom time 15 minutes almost guarantees exposure, necessarily infection, exposure. maybe top 25-30 ~120 teams CFB profitable, don‚Äôt see could afford bubble. even could, many kids manage roster - game much physical contact. could work? matter fact. anti-mask crowd believes intimidating trying inflict moronic others, simply opening eventual encounter wrong person. Funny never see someone could physically break dumbass half. That‚Äôs way pussies operate. Florida makes humans decide become scumbags? People resting hopes preventing solving infection, it‚Äôs time embrace actually promising options. gonna require continuous testing. two. gamble basically, testing needed check turns would worked well great saved months Exactly know, hope so, staff talk to, one seems concerned isn‚Äôt willing give up/lose retirement she‚Äôs close getting, completely understand. It‚Äôs terrible position in. I‚Äôm new teacher (last year first year) I‚Äôm fully committed teaching long term, would seem like less loss me. yeah, never one claim even made. cannot bring admit wrong, dupes worse really, really shitty it. country political divide never going heal start meeting people middle one. ask sources work hospitals it‚Äôs okay release info. would happily give don‚Äôt want risk potentially causing trouble sort. 

The top 2 hospitals area still using HCQ. told 3rd one sources, don‚Äôt work hospital told hospital using too. know several doctors nurses work top two hospitals saying HCQ per hospital protocol, lifelong friend person say high command one hospital. related person also high command chain hospital. None secretive it, still. 

I trust aren‚Äôt lying... course know it‚Äôs okay say hospitals, it‚Äôs word. 

I live state bought ton HCQ beginning pandemic healthcare workers specifically, might clear state I‚Äôm in. waited days use Diogo Bat√°guas chance entering Relat√≥rio. people wanna throw big going away party invite cops public bullets party favours. 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Identification quarantine contacts COVID-19 patients reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

**What added report?**

Maine found using automated symptom monitoring part state‚Äôs contact tracing program well received, majority monitored contacts (96.4%) agreeing automated symptom monitoring. Automated symptom monitoring promptly identified COVID-19 diagnoses among monitored contacts. Among 1,622 persons enrolled automated symptom monitoring system, 190 (11.7%) developed COVID-19.

**What implications public health practice?**

Prompt case investigation rapidly identify contacts recommend quarantine, reducing additional exposures transmission. Automated tools, available multiple languages formats, might improve contact tracing programs reduce resource needs, including staffing.  Yea, sports coming back.... student going watch watch something else play video games instead. nyet can. Judging track record gonna bad, least america. probably lot people would died flu still around vulnerable Covid. Gee thanks, still 1 day finally declared global pandemic WHO. knew took entirely long were. Nothing different, highly suspected airborne aerosolized, even asymptomatically spread back then. Thanks playing Surges cases happen countries, especially one proud ego üëÄ protesting, keeps breeding virus spreading around. Imagine every country starved virus little imported cases there's nothing much import. 

Also countries little cases zero infected subsequent infectee quarantine thus ensuring stays one county city residents go days normal (with masks) Also, threshold achieving herd immunity previously stated ~70%. say maybe ~60%. wouldn‚Äôt call substantial. Especially estimate ~10% MAY immunity Sweden (it difficult result measure). again, please reference study provided suggests immunity covid last. Wether remains don‚Äôt know - covid seems moving target sorts knowledge evolving. definitively say Sweden achieved call threshold herd immunity substantially lower factually incorrect.

if went sub's perception virus everyone contracted COVID-19 would 100% chance getting every fucking appendage body amputated

the reality probably somewhere in-between. bad reddit's doomsday, germaphobe userbase would make believe, bad enough warrant mask usage better hygiene forseeable future Nah man, that's Pennsyltucky Could convince others staff walk you? teacher myself, seems like one plays. March different time regarding COVID.  Especially name 'The Covid 19s' available morally wrong, legally make sense. Getting tested leave super inconvenienced. could lose job even. joke, man. Even contagious is, proving extremely hard. Even massive spike extremely unlikely nearly 200 million people going get US. Bastards. 

I still friends Disney legal, I‚Äôm one say, ‚Äúhey get in?‚Äù act fancy Blue Bayou. ü§£  wrong people? humanity devolved what? Duh. Also lower income neighborhoods likely undereducated therefore likely follow misleading information puts greater risk. mono. 6 months sickness lethargy Tens millions?

There dozens millions us! plays COVID-deniers saying naturally super strong immune systems ‚Äúcuz country folk‚Äù...

A super strong immune system novel virus? 


I'm sure understand words mean. long-term care homes Ontario ~30% positive cases died (and residents tested). NY could similar. I'd called cops. This. husband dealing post covid symptoms virus march still.  many people called mental fil told diet eating like normal person.  husband vegetarian diabetic avoids carbs foods. asked FIL nutrients missing could say red meat, pizza, pasta. Sigh. Oregon resident here, mail voting easy never issues. never heard disputed election due method. Sure, studies take time. developing herd immunity. yet occurred Sweden. want sources quote (from Mayo Clinic June, sure consider ‚Äúold‚Äù) I‚Äôve provided below. 

And I‚Äôll ask again: sources statement Sweden achieved herd immunity? even chief epidemiologist suggests that. 

How immunity might achieved individuals post-covid said immunity might actually disappear within months, thereby slowing achievement herd ideas Sweden might flattened curve (note: achieving herd experts saying nowhere new achieving herd immunity July! Happy reading! http://archive.is/NZNUz People going Applebee's Longhorn Steakhouse dine-in open again. ridiculous. refuse go anywhere dine-in available. I'm legitimately get take-out half people even wear masks correctly. they'll pull talk you. think justifiable used force necessary stop assault.

However think point stands bar lowered considered legitimate theater. used deliberately ridiculous comparison illustrate point. okay, studies? i'm first guy replied btw. 60 days, commonest symptoms SARS patients general weakness (8 12 patients), exertional dyspnea (6 12 patients), joint pains (4 12 patients) partial hair loss (11 12 patients) republicans trying limit voting. Mail ballots make voting easier. Groceries? 

I‚Äôm high risk. go early twice month, grocery doesn‚Äôt enforceable requirement. delivery/pickup options failing (Kroger... fired).

My local farmers market doesn‚Äôt open 10, desperately need haircut. Truly, growing hair out. bald two years... it‚Äôs summer. REALLY want pull wigs. 

Please. Show compassion. thought pier 1 went business believe masks work? 

Apparently keeping casinos going important voting. articles comment. That's factually correct. Back March lockdowns began, sole goal objective flatten curve, avoid hospitals overwhelmed (to prevent Italy's situation) eventually spread infection time.

It April-May talks vaccine ""coming 2020"" began seriously take place politicians decided indefinitely extend state emergency even curve flattened.

It understandable people want wait vaccine resume lives. even approved year, long time everyone world able get it. We're looking 2022 minimum. Thanks, too. get thinking I'm really glad open dialogue! 

So I'll say, 1) police sees suspect armed, police shot at, take cover try communicate/de-escalate. think role police increase public safety/decrease incidents harm community, would make sense, right? increase public safety requires police immediately lethally return fire. 

2) debate dash cam body cam shows. can't verify heart watch man die. say shot still fired including back head Hakim tackled ground gun kicked away him. 

3) I'd think fair say Littleton died black put happened side side Adam Zaborowski. say police extra pressure, ""given tensions everything going on"", Zaborowski killed too, too, shot police. What's potentially even damning Zaborowski's case automatic weapon injure officer. RemindMe! 4 weeks ‚ÄúThis ridiculous prediction - /u/mitsudang‚Äù times, remodel it‚Äôs impossible get hooked reservation anymore. Timing? New Yorkers spent cold overcast winter bundled up. may nadir vitamin levels. Texas gets warm around Feb-March enjoy spring outdoors much possible hiding sun. Texans May peak Vitamin levels. 

If there‚Äôs truth bode well country winter. get $350,000, believe. viral inoculum significant infection outcome lot useful research data there.

Google term viral inoculum first studies include case studies chimpanzees (infected Hepatitis HIV) mice (infected Influenza A) experienced milder outcomes inoculated diluted amount virus.

Covid behaved strangely many ways thus far related transmission, believe masks help dilute portion therefore heavily reduce severity infection transmitted.


Example: mother law caught hospital back May pulling mask lunch coworker talking face face 30minutes. whole unit got terrible coughs time course classic symptoms quarantined room away rest us home; conversely, s.o. caught shortly thereafter (probably times wear mask screamed cramped junction hallway needing glass milk etc.) nowhere near bad go it. Why? 5 states years problems managing it. wish can, won't. Shorter lines? Fast, efficient infection.

Can provide evidence true? seems like wishful thinking. 

I sceptical myself. seen evidence transference really occur outside education activity, though I‚Äôd need bit digging find it. book called Case Education - different politically author, found arguments compelling.

Wait tomorrow's report compare rest Europe Jokes them, wear mask. sick fucking hate people. high school America kids arent even getting educated.. kind testing would useless without contact tracing. anyone contact tracing US? faces aware linked article says Sweden roughly even economic growth right?

No-one wants see children infected, please invent highly unlikely scenarios. plenty legitimate reasons well. press schools reopen? either best troll worst troll I've ever experienced. Please, find local community college take courses English language, wonders. I'm trying move goal posts all, original comment virus mutate something deadly kids. asked provide evidence that. not, mutations make deadly anyone, especially children ever test negative? One old classmates tested positive April continued testing positive mid July. Amen! Yes. absolutely seems unwell, don‚Äôt think malicious, exactly... ugh, she‚Äôs really harmed ostensible cause given lot ammunition lot shitty people. hope wrong, going happen. need vaccine fall. Sets bad precedent basically accessible govt whenever want, think rogue govts etc I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm part TikTok now. projections. anything stop virus 1000 cases means 1,000,000 soon enough, that's worry. 103 fever back March go anywhere least 65% alcohol? exactly works.

You said something stupid, corrected you, job go stupid.

Stop lazy moron. You‚Äôre stating hasn‚Äôt already happened see time media, take (and police press releases) gun naming grain salt.

Most weapons today updated versions handful platforms (designs) - AR, AK, etc. Hence everything called AK-47 AR-15. really think matters regarding substance article, model names see print often technically correct. low. seeing spread contact items. worried take sunlight minutes. uv light dry hot air kill anything it. Dude, murdered...lol...suck simp Development term designing building.

They believe several vaccines developed.

Several vaccines process proving fulfill purpose. New state motto! guess would there‚Äôs lot overlap multi sport athletes programs wouldn‚Äôt able field team everybody commit one sport. think accept fall season MAYBE able play sports Spring   There's link above.  33% US population always anti-education, high school dropouts, etc.

the difference used car salesman runs country buying garbage he's selling past four years

the country sixth bankruptcy, fourth wife, we're going failure time dead dumb? I've heard politicians start call alternative facts science claim opposition ""anti-science"".

Their antics continue allow frame intellectuals spite rejecting widely accepted held scientific positions. Maybe unsubscribe Sanders President lying support.

There plenty candidates primary. Voters chose Joe. Sorry minority another candidate still gotten it.

But always DNC conspiracy Bernie loses.

Your comments suggested polls wrong, matter.

Biden every swing state needs win EC.

Keep crying. suits you. think there's ever virus history infected total population country/the world, 1% population US irrelevant. people even produce antibodies t-cells able fight mild virus. scientists also believe people may protected coronavirus exposures would also reduce overall amount people needed reach herd immunity.  Here's ""education"" racial stuff. smell bullshit? learned civil war started states rights, Lincoln abolished slavery, things good. people really like got bit racist. ok, ended Reconstruction. got civil rights movement racism basically eradicated everyone equal happy. 

I would **love** hear future educators South (I'm Texas) would claim BLM protests actually about. Go tell fucking parents that. ""eh, kid dead, really big deal, small overall number so, worries!"". true. focused paying people stay home, mandatory masks, economy would come back quickly after.  Germany anti-mask protest? Right us think districts handling well. We‚Äôre going back parents/students/teachers opt stay home continue distance learning 100% understand people don‚Äôt want go back, understand what‚Äôs actually happening. idea parent would don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs like kids well don‚Äôt any, can‚Äôt say wouldn‚Äôt feel way whole situation parent. say fuk'em redneck? necessarily banjos incest, like Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, snake oil.

It‚Äôs hard best circumstances. front page yesterday. Thanks. number new cases Flordia today? tally decisions? snopes page yet? day saw someone mention book good intro viruses. also predicted conronavirus outbreak think? can‚Äôt seem find now... anyone suggestion? would non fiction. Maybe Deadliest Enemy? ever stop think ""Wow, people allowed drive cars""?  theology thing pretty interesting historically. Vaguely around 800, Lombards bested pope Pepin/Charlemagne started continued process spreading church practices across territory (fun fact: reason notated classical music tradition, part). Alcuin York important figure standardizing number practices, including liberal arts education (by standards time). could get bachelors trivium/language arts (grammar, logic, rhetoric) masters quadrivium/measurement arts (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music), doctorate reserved exclusively canon law theology. So, ironically, theology literally first subject one could obtain doctorate for.

That may interesting initially thought. Trump? recent interview, yes. 

I saying sarcastically though.  made far? Good job. someone EL15 don‚Äôt push sports spring things going presumably better then? Social distancing MASLS work inside.

It stays lingering stagnant air spreads even 6 feet.... Anywhere person breathes, particles remain air. someone eventually walks said space, they'll breathe in. definetely walk space. landmine set, matter person set 100 feet away...... person standing right it. People stupid Florida months upon months prepare compared NY. Florida far different population density New York well. importantly, mortality rate nationwide also fallen *nation-wide* part new treatment methods, scientific awareness, hospital system capacity preparation, ppe supply increases ventilator access federal govt . comparison *DEATHS* entirely unfair given one happened february april happened june now. That's answer death rates nation-wide (including florida) fallen time.



Why Florida broken records new cases then? months prepare? Maybe covid exposing risk offering cure Yes no. Let explain. 

So yes ... Index funds invest large amount money across entire industry named index keep pushing stocks slowly up. people invest money time tends towards growth, acts upwards pressure stocks indexes. like idling vehicle gear. take foot break it'll slowly creep forward. 

And no... indexes volatile explain wild stock price swings last while. seeing active trades stocks, derivatives, futures, etc. slow investment time, quick pump dumps. look volume trades see uptick people panicked sold everything, pretty quick recovery within couple months folks jumped get ""cheap"" stocks flip others quick buck. believe we've bottomed yet, I'm one dude internet matter reason why. still partially fault rise cases. blame ones disagree with. People alive ‚Äòshut economy‚Äô.

Also, chemical plants longer inform people live near released chemical explosion. everyone voting bills laws right now. It‚Äôs happening, happening right now, getting worse part due people don‚Äôt understand viruses spread even basic math.  Don‚Äôt tests take couple days provide results? one making wild claim first place, honus you.

But know type. misrepresenting claims statement wrong claiming saying trust data. wrong, saying trust data. little reading spouting off, would seen that.

[The Trump Administration mandated hospitals sidestep Centers Disease Control Prevention send critical information COVID-19 hospitalizations equipment different federal take reporting data claiming manipulating. evidence claims? would prefer communism. care 154k dead faced possibility happening him. fair, reducing anything reductive. feel attacked even though follow guidelines. Put pillory let children spit  system isnt designed serve anything close ethical.

Yeah somehow past year we've gone ""the invisible hand efficiently ethically allocates resources allows thriving society"" ""the hand god demands sacrifice feed weak, sick, elderly, kill us all"". Nah always start early, fall break October. much awesome spring break since weather actually nice. Wow cant believe anti-south bullshit. arent last education called anti-intellectuals Hahaha! calling guy evil, he's 100% right...

What 1% 300,000,000? lot people look cute them. Sadly happening around world.

The amount pure nonsense, often gets accepted truth, general disbelief science see daily Belgian newspaper forums deeply concerning. 1.1% one day seems concerning. Hopefully everyone getting tested first time. 1% compounded daily would good. Guess we'll see weeks plays out. Hydrogen peroxide diluted water 1.5% washable towels. makes covid special...? joking? Maybe fact literal pandemic known cure yet vaccine? maybe super transmissible? Last time checked, die car accident, pass onto granny. Last time checked, drink death, pass onto neighbor.

Why concerned integrity in-person voting? 

I've always told issues, statistically insignificant. see millionaires human. governments decide care vote assholes out. Dah, comrade.  According DGS epidemiological situation report, since beginning pandemic today, 51,569 confirmed cases infection 1,738 deaths.

The Lisbon Tagus Valley region today totals 26,389 cases, 66 Sunday, 62.2 percent cases nationwide.

In percentage terms, last 24 hours increase number confirmed cases 0.2 percent (from 51,463 51,569).

The number patients reported recovered covid-19 increased last 24 hours 37,111, 127 more, recording higher number new cases (106).

As confirmed cases, Lisbon Vale Tejo region leads, 26,389, followed North (18,797, 17 cases compared Sunday's bulletin).

The Centro region 4,465 confirmed infections, plus 10 new cases compared Sunday, according bulletin updated today, gathers data midnight Sunday.

The Algarve totals 892 cases, five Sunday, Alentejo rose 745 confirmed infections (two more).  Thank you! read those. 

I think one answering answer yet. far cannot determined herd immunity (i posted links another response you). argument whole time statements (meant fact?) Sweden reached herd immunity. Perhaps agree instead whatever Sweden reached time how, don‚Äôt yet actually know answer. Fewer hundreds found document CA's use hydroxycloroquine, seem like banned telling doctors freely proscribe inappropriately would think means like handing anyone asks doctor think warranted. 

 info I've seen quack doctors selling ""covid packs"" hydroxy along Xanax viagra anyone would ask thousands dollars claiming 100% cure prevention covid fraudulent. That's California hitting back think.

If grandpa's doctor thought appropriate would free prescribe it. I've got link Mayo Clinic going treatments used studied, honestly hydroxychloroquine recommended recently sources I've seen (partly due heart problems someone else mentioned). guess remdesivir convalescent plasma therapy recommended recently still changing get FOXNEWS cover maybe viewers stop w taking thing lightly? *never learned ""Death sports"" thing athletes decided play.

Additionally, Texas continue rise reported deaths awhile. They‚Äôre still 7k cases per day testing completely bottle necked. get curve way flat, though, right?

Like: large parts Europe Asia successfully flattened curve. shoved little bit downward, decided good enough, gave up. wished back March schools first shut down. remember asking spouse exasperation, good state borders wide open travel?

FWIW, proposed alternative would be:
 
To allow older children capable remote learning home allowing younger children occupy classrooms (now vacated older students) order decrease density.

Additionally, believe could opportunity allow hiring TAs pool younger, healthier college-age (and beyond) persons find without employment.

This would allow teachers may older comorbidities associated poor COVID-19 outcomes teach remotely, still allow hands-on education opportunities younger children.

And although United States seen cases everywhere, states‚Äô early reopening plans hands-off measures, recently ban Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) local mask requirements, reflect cultural emphasis prioritizing freedom government dictate ‚Äî anti-science bias rooted history region.

Many people resisted even simple measures ‚Äî including social distancing highly politicized wearing masks ‚Äî public health officials indicated might enough contain novel coronavirus. Florida localities, example, opponents requirements wear masks claimed idea providing protection based ‚Äúpseudoscience.‚Äù court hearing consider mandating mask-wearing Palm Beach County, opponents told lawmakers, ‚ÄúYou God,‚Äù citing support masks ‚Äúwant throw God‚Äôs wonderful breathing system out.‚Äù

In June, Anthony S. Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, openly warned risks resulting rampant ‚Äúanti-science bias‚Äù anti-intellectualism, risen right Trump administration. phenomenon deeply historically rooted, covid-19 exposing dangerous public health expert recommendations ignored undermined.

Where anti-science bias come from? became rooted Southern culture politics Scopes Trial, popularly known Monkey Trial, 1925 Dayton, Tenn.

The trial stemmed modernism rising post-World War era. Southern whites felt changes challenged way life, including seeing teaching evolution attack traditional values. moved aggressively retain socio-cultural control time transformative change limiting modern influences.

Tennessee accordingly passed Butler Act 1925, banned teaching Charles Darwin‚Äôs theory evolution public schools. demonstrating humans descended apes, teaching evolution undermined belief white superiority defined Jim Crow South. Dayton businessman emboldened teacher John Scopes challenge law hopes ensuing controversy would attract new business town.

An international media frenzy engulfed Scopes‚Äôs ensuing trial, pitted three-time former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan ‚Äî arguing behalf state ‚Äî celebrated lawyer Clarence Darrow. Bryan also took stand expert witness, exalted anti-intellectualism, making America laughingstock world stage.

Scopes would convicted violating Butler Act, Tennessee Supreme Court overturned conviction technicality.

Nonetheless, occurred around turn century Lost Cause movement emerged glorify antebellum South, Monkey Trial became mythologized Bible Belt. intensity trial breathed new life anti-evolution movement, coupled emphasis biblical literalism, found home among evangelicals began define Southern culture and, eventually Billy Graham‚Äôs support Richard Nixon, came define Southern politics.

Following trial, anti-intellectualism became acceptable. solidified establishment Dayton William Jennings Bryan College 1930, students faculty must annually affirm belief story Genesis. Anti-intellectualism drew strength gathering religious fundamentalists whose mission spread beliefs became public southern Whites responded changes occurred result civil rights movement.

At height civil rights movement 1960s, White southern evangelicals saw long-standing regional dominance threatened civil rights activism federal legislation expanding Black civil rights. Exemplifying trend, Tennessee repealed Butler Act 1967, Supreme Court ruled similar law Arkansas next year. period, Congress high court shattered Jim Crow segregation banned prayer public schools.

Their monopoly political cultural power seemingly attack, White evangelicals clung biblical literalism embraced anti-intellectualism refuge. successfully organized stem progress growing women‚Äôs movement and, particular, prevent ratification Equal Rights Amendment, newfound emphasis teaching female subordination. Outside Tennessee Texas, Bible Belt rejected amendment, providing enough states prevent ratification.

In 1980s 1990s, egged rising conservative media, southern White evangelicals, increasingly became base Republican Party, came associate intellectualism science coastal elites looked upon scorned values. Conservatives flocked Phyllis Schlafly‚Äôs campaign ERA saw liberal elite centered universities, media, arts Democratic Party determined ram morally anathema things, like legal abortion, explicit anti-Christian movies music like ‚ÄúThe Last Temptation Christ‚Äù (1988) ‚ÄúMe Horny‚Äù (1988), rights LGBTQ Americans throats. Democrats also favored environmental policies many Southern evangelicals saw unnecessary damaging economy.

This political culture fueled ever-increasing anti-intellectualism traced origins back Scopes trial. 1997 2005, courts heard later decided biblical literalists Louisiana Georgia, respectively, sought include advisory teaching evolution science textbooks.

When comes latest covid-19 battleground, reopening schools, opposition scientific experts, specifically guidance provided CDC, persistently displayed Trump administration, especially Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Republican allies state level. administration stubbornly insisted getting children back school without offering advice safely achieve this. Notably, DeVos applauded Miami-Dade County‚Äôs plan in-person learning, despite region covid-19 hot zone. Substituting rhetoric culture war politics expertise dangerous.

Covid-19 proving unwillingness listen doctors scientists great harm. Religious freedom public health aren‚Äôt actually incompatible. countering anti-science bias become stalking horse culture wars crucial creating better policies allowing citizens make best possible choices society. Exactly. began smart preparing back kids sent home. PLENTY time devise plan. excuses post safety not. post NFL salaries


The average NFL salary 2.7 million dollars. heavily skewed towards smaller percentage higher end players.  minimum salary 510-600K. sound like lot...except average NFL career 3 years.  majority guys fill roster 50k would huge amount. 


Furthermore NFL salaries unique guaranteed unless specified. instance might sign 3 year 1.6 million dollar contract (500k-ish per year) 40K signing bonus. get hurt, suck football, released, etc....the money see signing bonus.  doesnt include taxes, agent fees etc. Furthermore many contracts 'incentive' based. say much money earned based stats, awards games played.



So average NFL player might make bucks. likely become high end earner. More-likely end injury develop long term issues CTE.  


I two patients ex-NFL journeymen. Sweetest guys.  early 50's knees 80 year olds



TL/DR - alot rich NFL players. not. salaries guaranteed. 50k would alot average player MAGA hats. smart.‚≠ê WiFi, internet access, electricity, time away working $$ order facilitate lessons. kids school adults work offices. home run air conditioner more. examples top head. kids pretty independent learners still need tech support help comprehend lesson.

Bull Gates gets microchips us, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs unlikely get Covid-19 twice, cases suspected likely early positive developed symptoms later. get twice, doesn‚Äôt make vaccine less useful?

Yeah, another commenter pointed out. corrected previous comment. change essence post though. home nice soapy sponge rag much effective wipe buy. That's thinking... lower transmission rate area, pretty good mask compliance nearly everyone video, people still couple feet apart (vs packed like sardines ala normal non-covid rave) took place outside? Definitely ideal something I'd condone attend, looking factors, mean, attending school indoors 8 hours substantially risky is. first we've seen something like definitely last, least seems like safety measures taken.

And exactly President prevent spread pandemic? Everything either ""racist"" (like banning travel China) ""Hitler-like dictatorship fascism"" people like you.

 akin asking white supremacy still thing? moment, adding ""."" behind "".com"" works (for me) bypass paywall. Can't say long it'll last, go: # ""Mouth protection effective case large spread infection""

**There still evidence draw conclusions effectiveness face masks, according experts.**

**But scenarios protections useful.**

**- determines whether mouth protection works many infected, says hygienist Anders Johansson.**

There still decision wear face masks public places, even though debate become increasingly relevant Sweden.

The Swedish Public Health Agency previously said issue oral protection complicated, studies prove oral protection reduces spread infection. authority's press conference Tuesday, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell asked new literature study face masks, Karolinska Institutet, among others, participated.

\- shows thing previous studies. see masks stop drops, whether effect society said, says.

However, face masks excluded measure future.

\- good complement see infection spreads quickly contexts crowds avoided. spread infection increases, examine masks well measures, see anything make difference situation, says Tegnell.

Anders Johansson, hygienist V√§sterbotten region, researcher chairman Swedish Hygiene Association, agrees oral hygiene useful. According him, effective tool when, example, infection spreading large extent.

\- determines whether face masks work many infected. huge spread, get great effect contagious yet time get symptoms therefore stay home, says.

The great difficulty, says, accessing carry virus without feeling ill move environments close others, public transport, restaurants shops.

He emphasizes infection curve turns upwards measure become relevant. time, says face masks calming effect tried isolate months want go out.

\- everyone 70 years older long time, think would feel safer shop mouth protection used. everyone store mouth protection, probably slightly fewer infections feels safer.

Hand hygiene, keeping distance minimizing size groups still seen important ways limit infection.

\- Viruses accumulate inside outside face masks, risk getting virus hands, catching others spreading it. appreciate risk high society. risk greater healthcare, think. point mouth protection spread infection others. longer others, greater risk. That's getting store dangerous, says Johansson.

He also believes Swedes need practice wearing face masks, becomes relevant future.

\- work healthcare learned avoid getting dirty, throw wash hands, says adds World Health Organization (WHO) designed instructions need implement educational effort Sweden use. increased.

\- probably also thing makes resist know. important thing wash hands, becomes whole package; face masks always used conjunction measures.

According Johansson, also many ambiguities discussion mouth protection.

\- somewhat confused debate many emotional arguments. controversial one sure figures, therefore necessary produce basis decisions made Sweden. think would calm emotional debate.

## Background: direct evidence - Monday, research group Karolinska Institutet Stockholm McMaster University Canada presented study 25 scientific articles oral protection. concluded even direct evidence face masks reduce transmission corona virus, cloth face masks reduce spread virus.  experimental studies, difficult make transfer would like use face masks larger scale society, says hygiene doctor Anders Johansson.  Fabric mouth protection increase spread healthcare, know that, probably reusing them. healthcare context think risk great society infection-sensitive people hospital. different conditions.  him, however, think twice buying face masks fabric sewing one yourself.  use fabric access disposable face masks, simply little better. many face masks market, enough, better fabric. Fabric better nothing, lot criteria must met, fabric must several layers, example. either/or situation, behavioral changes herd immunity lower R. 

So I'll flip around: seen preventative measures alone work? small island nations (external isolation) and/or nations severe lockdowns possible (internal isolation). That's it. stepmom volunteered Bible camp could keep eyes little siblings. 90% brainwashing 10% free food. free childcare there's that. 10 minutes? matter time game started, bars packed 9 10 game day, tailgaters almost always breakfast going. Football truly one part whole game-day experience, I'd argue even important part many. legit Tweet, please open thread up. I'm done social distancing. Yeah, can't argue back, change subject. amazing countries got together decided ""take one team"" ""the extreme left"" could get Trump office. course, also convince Trump downplay virus masks order help spread virus. Wait minute...then means Trump's working deep state left...oh...my...gosh. Even none die, still risk getting infected infecting people do, probably die. It‚Äôs numbers game. article frustrating. Anti-intellectualism far closely aligned politics regional culture; see exact thing pop right-wing strongholds country (as well Alberta Quebec, deeply conservative provinces). Yes, obviously, higher rate far-right conservatism South, reductive make regional, therefore unhelpful navigating challenges anti-intellectualism presenting. comes back government though. properly funding education let population become selfish, ignorant assholes. dad sounds desperate. talk him, try find middle ground. Perhaps losing something valuable right now, like business opportunities come back.

Reduction qol rampant many parts apply many people. Still, something worried about. 

But know dad better do. nuts, nuts. parents. That‚Äôs keep saying! No! need rush back normal cause can‚Äôt lay low months! Oh ofcourse get wrong fully support getting virus control get close businesses save lives. I'm simply highlighting long term economic challenges virus causing pandemic bring reform revolution   mean I‚Äôm religious I‚Äôd probably keep away guy talking loudly devil. Idk decided go religious people though Yeah weird people go around public giving fuck society live endangering others kind deserve reap benefits society. kind like murder someone, drink drive, deemed danger society (temporarily) removed it. Weird people advocating universal healthcare CARE HEALTH SOCIETY. FUCKING WEIRD? Go dentist! go, pain bad. Thankfully nothing serious well aware procedures cleanliness. still panicked 2 weeks appt I‚Äôd rather know.

America people doxx. Yeah, he's 80. he'd 81 next year still alive. 82 year that. average life expectancy someone who's reached age 80 88+; guy lost 8 years life.

Do want shorten life 8 years? want people's lives idiocy shorten life 8 years? people diagnosed untreated, undiagnosed mental health problems. ask states, ones testing people. might wanna try post again. America ""white"" unsuspectably cultural racial term. used consider Protestant countries white. would puzzle Europeans. Currently however US institutions equate white caucasian.

It sounds great. Everyone need want work need that, polices? Bin collectors? Maintain sewers? Supermarket workers? Power stations? can't find enough people essential jobs, force people? Raise wage/prices order pay more? price increase compound increased inflation?

Unless mass rapid testing contact tracing, haven‚Äôt seen yet US. It‚Äôs unfortunate reality situation. sounds like something anti vaxxer would say parents 50? think EU less giving 22-25 days depending countries. 
Depending companies, get 30 days plus bridge days national holidays, somewhere around 47-50 days. helps live Catholic country/area I‚Äôve seen people saying don‚Äôt trust vaccine, it‚Äôs conspiracy?? don‚Äôt know conspiracy why?? He‚Äôs donated millions dollars infections disease research. lot young doctors died world. Prolonged exposure increases severity risk matter protected least base opinion facts rather general distrust corporations. Would /s help? Jesus fucking christ Rutgers education.

People go Rutgers play football, go play school. There's argument Rutgers football terrible, education still top notch. ""Potential"" - word use indicate fucked two weeks. 1 tsp bleach + 1 cup water spray bottle. Spray surfaces let sit least five minutes.

sorry remember internet source. researched back March using ever since. There's also issue super-infection. cases people cold/flu top COVID-19. want avoid costs that's recipe lots death. That's happened second wave 1918 Flu, massive number flu+bacteria people ended dying rather quickly essentially ARDS. real issue going ones educated newly disabled Well yes, quite accurate, result quite delayed, speak. Another good thing look percent positivity rates tests. long assume death rate percentage relatively fixed case size, looking percent positivity gives good idea prevalence virus general community. remember, people tested random. No, selectable response, likely survey knowledge rather intentions desires. half year plan school fall, clear useful federal guidelines state responses vary adequate burying collective heads sand. annoying aspect people try pit school systems parents all, allied demanding answers governments backed science rationality. People also hand toys ring actually soggy toddler chewing them. always tempted lean lick hand kids face see like coated spit. Instead pack toy slather hand sanitizer right front them.

Summer worse, bra shoe money. haven‚Äôt lived someone hands sweaty wad cash card there. really don‚Äôt understand that, pockets purses belt packs exist. I'm one voted 2016 wont voting 2020 I‚Äôm looking here, guess cumulative hospitalizations, new Right? Shiiiiiiiiitttt pay thousands dollars corporations track everything!

But mean convenient.  Agree.

Feminists. Creationists. Flat-earthers. Anti-vaxxers. Anti-maskers. display similar behaviour, counter-productive kind. Trust science trust government two entirely different concepts. Uhh guy using observation make point, shy away it, people use data make conclusions time. Yes, making data driven conclusions form reasoning.

My point right data time passes. number reasons: imperfect sensitivity existing tests, lack adequate longitudinal testing make conclusions, behavioral shifts change probability reexposure first infection, list goes on. 

I think important understand whether reinfection possible principle, is, occurs.

It's simple saying 15/millions approx = 0, we're good !

To condense point even further, sample bias I'm pointing to. trying estimate reinfection rate, 15/millions works unbiased estimate 'true' reinfection rate. unbiased estimate would took random sample people, method 100% determine reinfected, use rate estimate.

That's have. doctors happened notice reinfection took place, can't rule selection effects.

It's possible establishing reinfection beyond shadow doubt difficult given current standards many undetected cases may pop better attention / time. remember reading something testosterone. dont remember anyone suggesting need become woman. think drawing correlation men getting disproportionately sick women fuck wrong people? Even catches odds he'll fine.

And gets fine, prove big deal. doesn‚Äôt kill kids?

Uneducated people dangerous future. Maybe propagate idea individuals responsible unknowingly passing illnesses. pandemic happened nobody ever blamed individuals unknowingly passing disease. I‚Äôve always lived Florida. It‚Äôs like people Florida attracts people. Lot sketchy people imported. Yup. I'd like maybe see type oculus feedback type systems. kids see play games. Though would involve overreach privacy maybe something agreeable worked out. Kids go virtual museums awesome places would liability real life. teachers, fact checkers available answer questions. bothers education system basically started, way create simple minded, order following, factory workers guess one thing incorrect ""active cases"" really ""active cases yet found"". One would assume someone knows covid wouldnt goto event (big assumption, know...). wonder accounts that. isnt one. many many kids rebound fromthis, especially special education risk. People pretending year two kids skills recovered that's incorrect. sacrificing education lives, right choice, kids making massive sacrifice need respect won't. going lots measures taken minimize spread. Also deaths primarily elderly people comorbidities. average parent 20s 30s. people want send kids to. realize kids school virus spread already. see kids without parents dead teachers. mainly affects elderly ones already sick, poor physical health, nursing homes, etc. No, personal inaction. nothing stopping people wearing masks regardless requirement. Here's another thought. cases happen bc symptoms taken seriously enough.

My kids' school district come list incredibly vague symptoms. them, school you. time, keeping attendance rule can't miss 10 days school year.

So kid says cough nausea 11th time, do?

My guess parents teachers point going start ignoring guidelines. We're cancelled trips disney 1st week august bros. :( That's here. friends different cities say feel safer there's lots people gets taken seriously redneck land people proud wearing mask account 1 day old. troll. need reply. SEC teams eying new schedules includes play top schools *other* division reconsidering.

Florida last year: Haha Georgia play Bama! East OURS! 
Florida now: %#\^&amp;\* birds real? I'm probably going get voted hell this, started doing. pandemic hit everything started flying shelves abundance two things. Baby wipes liquid bleach. also bottles 70% alcohol. took one large bags baby wipes divided two. ran half warm water spray minute get much ""baby wipe"" chemicals could. figured gentle (fragrance free, hypoallergenic) baby wipes probably bad could rinse clean really easily. set aside let dry. dry diluted bleach added wipes zip lock bag make bleach wipes. alcohol without diluting it. use bleach wipes household things keep pack alcohol wipes car can't get sink run hand sanitizer, know non-existent many months. least live. actually ended cutting alcohol wipes half since felt like wasting bit hands. worked far know.  compliance state mandated everyone here, still, lot people wearing ""neck mask"", ""mouth nose"" mask. people still refuse wear mask.

Lots people still partaking lots unnecessary trips, outings, etc. going get worse long term ""covid fatigue"" beats even somewhat reasonable people.

I seen family gone eat since January. Everyone mention shocked things regularly. would like know too. Back people think Bill Gates monitoring everyone Windows made sense, days seems random. much money goes toward giant 30,000 seat football stadiums. Oh gotcha. Yeah. Though, perhaps there‚Äôs difference two staff mere cloth surgeons masks day long vs dentist N95 face shield short time. 

I still believe masks play part reducing viral load. seems non-respirators safe substitute close proximity hours. couple ways this, virtually impossible United States. One wear masks, social distance. People like focus negative millions Americans wearing masks, avoiding social distancing, putting trips, limiting outings, etc.  

A whole new wave regulations went effect early July numbers started going again.  Everybody comply, many did. 

I expect see numbers go least next weeks result that, natural progression pandemic already impacted many vulnerable reckless.

Schools opening big wildcard could change things though. Sweden's peak months ago, treatments chance survival worse, son can't really compare situation completely. great treatments getting better, shows problems Sweden's frontloading cases, also makes deaths comparison tricky since Sweden would undoubtedly less cases hit now. Compare early currently hit US states. compromise, students dumb dead. invisible hand capitalism fail, supportive hand government handouts rich wealthy fail. Sounds good theory. politicians change mind happened them. Hmm... know Norwegian Prime Minister opened schools said publicly mistake close done panic? U.K U.S open [or planning open] schools. charitable kind call strategy. getting small group people meet beach, everyone wears mask stays 6 feet apart, relatively low risk way friends family see person.

You don‚Äôt *have* go indoor restaurant masks afterwards. responsible ways socialize. distinctions matter. unions. forget cut. Honestly anything would better Carson's proposal True enough. Heck way address climate change though. put faith recoveries, live MI...where recovered could mean ventilator, multi organ failure, last video chat family, 31 days dead, recovered. There's between. Orleans parish schools suck anyway. don‚Äôt see can‚Äôt start later make time longer days like hurricane Katrina. Even don‚Äôt make time, worth one student dying? need stop normalizing prison rape jokes. Spoiler alert: have. 

As church going Christian sends kid faith based private school, becoming abundantly clear many churches religious organizations money first lives second. Maybe loosen up, got three week trip Canadian Rockies coming September, think it‚Äôs going really great mental health. Exponential growth. Something humans hard time understanding. Except still better 90% countries world. Peaked!?! Peaked?!? haven‚Äôt even begun peak. Florida reported 586 hospitalizations day, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs new record? (Previous 581?) 

That said, know hospitalization data changed hands it‚Äôs recorded reported. Mentally ill is. last part important part think. supposed take family Disneyworld tomorrow.

When became clear June Disneyworld would likely open August cancelled. Luckily done trip insurance, ~$100 Disney fan substitute personality  No, they‚Äôre probably going happen part trip. travel changes humanity, concept clear ""waves"" ""outbreaks"" may even work cultures. compromise high schoolers remote learning elementary school students in-person learning. Prioritize elementary school assignments younger teachers, older teachers distance learning. may adjustment better young kids missing in-person learning. Kids living multi-generational households get waiver remote learning. exactly thoughts. Even receive super vaccine make immune, bother going? real Disney experience lot shows cancelled, meet greets gone, etc. believe hours shorter normal too? Wait time rides shorter yes, imagine there's wait time disinfecting cleaning rides board to(I would hope interactive rides especially like Smuggler's Run)? School determine intelligence anyway. Kids need much everyone thinks. There's millions ways learn. don't. uninfected quite long time, consider norm me. reason believe something changed, nothing would suggest deviation said norm happened.

So yeah, far know looks like uninfected.  Seriously, hindsight (not downplay *fore*sight) 21 day ‚Äúeveryone literally stay home, almost exceptions, seems like would‚Äôve easy. Yep. ""Buy rumor. Sell news."" -- biotech trading adage. A. daily numbers fluctuate lot. need look weekly moving average. one decline bit realistic manner
(from 69K July 25, 60.5K yesterday) death curve still rising (as deaths delayed wrt new cases). makes think case numbers fudged.

C. currently one biggest active outbreak CA that's declining totally believe California would fudge numbers please Trump. Btw even hospitalizations trending CA: (this means active infections start decline least 1-2 weeks ago)

D. TX new cases numbers actually declining last week

So, reasons believe decline real. Yet, think we'd get 10K/day Sept 1  Outbreak great contagion oddly similar times right now. Even fake cure similar HCQ. people authority going support guys like this. want use mealy mouthed platitudes, avoid triggering public. care either way,i'd likely push attempted murder/manslaughter depending angry got would pretty damn angry given circumstances. 
I follow ''pacifist'' way dealing people. Yea, kind like everyone views ""essential workers""... clever idea! I'm sorry üòü, certainly right. 

You made laugh specifying USA though, nothing post, idea happening place shit storm country. people foster kids income source read positives vaccines, etc, I'm hopeful. also living horrific reality. Household people trying recover Covid. community w/ increasing percent/positives, inadequate testing &amp; person school starting tomorrow. world I'm living in, tend bias toward positive news. want way &amp; try check myself. Yes, deflection tactics make sound like lockdown work.

We back almost zero long US gets act together. time us hit back :) COVID stranger jails prisons. Well, pandemic strategy Commander-in-Chief so... hope dry shave twat hit lemon juice... explain fact aren‚Äôt options freezing weather exact reason spreads winter. People used stuck indoors work, school, home around others. simply never get outside, even lunch break. sandwiches heroes tummy. Many worldwide RCTs coming negative HCQ, causing others cancel. point HCQ needs go away it‚Äôs taking resources away researching actual treatments, causing shortage people really need analysis Stat showed 1,200 Covid-19 drug trials underway planned, 237,000 people‚Äîmore third volunteers trials‚Äîwere supposed enrolled hydroxychloroquine studies. seems disproportionate, say least. ‚ÄúNobody get it,‚Äù Wachter says. ‚ÄúOverall, evidence strong enough drug simply go away Covid, would weeks ago politics.‚Äù infinite amount time

Would people quit this? could beat easily roughly two months agreed wore masks, no, people keep morons. Seems morons infinite amount time. away bond system use criminal justice way intended. protect Americans. 

This lady seems like threat time time would helpful. Eh, parent line kid knew go back to. Disney pretty safe; magic bands know times. security cameras also rival NSA. It‚Äôs place kid would go missing easily. Yes, people can't afford income even 2 weeks, president's attitude definitely help can't even comment think young healthy people less likely catch Coronavirus old immunocompromised people. living rock. Whatever makes feel justified racism, guy brings r/beholdthemasterrace nowhere. Seriously!! expensive, uncomfortable.... risk. student went Epcot last week believe it. Why???? Hunter arguing cashier returning item **that possession**, Sprague said.

WTF?

""Yes, I'd like return this.""

""Return what?""

""This.""

""Uhh &lt;looking sorry, return what?""

""&lt;exaggerated THIS!"" Probably.  Anyone remember scene Dark Knight two boats people detonator blow one, they're told one they'll blow up?

As hitting button asap real life. We're selfish bastards haha felony assault, bond tied voting registration district, return, action may applied ability vote.. fucktard. people stadiums either. Throw book moron. She‚Äôs teaching children behave like this. say tie boulder leg throw ocean. need stupid filter society. I‚Äôll get downvoted really don‚Äôt care. need rid stupidity pandemic deal one. logic cave man, assume complain enough people give rather argue escalate society life general let get away it.

i call ''ignore bully logic'' ignore go away right?,no continue find someone break. Canadians lecturing anyone criminal justice. dogshit system..., unless criminal works terrifically well! Russia 96 lol I‚Äôve meaning look it, think problem build units build build shittily deal build Thanks sacrifice. long term effects I'm really afraid of.

Yes, hate constantly hear ""death rate high worried about""...

How thick headed people be?

It's bad school opening experiment prove people stupid. Even cases spike people die get hospitalized, fortunate get infected get mild symptoms still believe big deal. True true ,have good day snail-overloard bless know, I'm unsure exit logic loop is, one even exists, sure, whatever victim, mother 10, told Miami Herald filed police report days incident report.

a mother 10 mother 10 year old? O.o... either arguing bad faith yet another drooling brainlet wield statistics understand them. must happy medium rough sketchy full trust fund land Hopefully COVID thang.  tipping point, unknown spread. case numbers low, contact tracing helps bring R0 lower warning people infect people. much easier R0 1 know cases. cases unknown origin start appearing easy lose control completely. next level piece dung. obviously young children pandemic. did, would understand things simple make be. Children younger high school age (and arguably even high schoolers) need adult facilitate distance learning ensure compliance remote curriculum. teacher teaching pod children, cannot facilitate his/her children's learning. come blasting sometimes spread disparate places? Hmmm... Yeah, could see that. argument Trump dumbass herd morons follow ""it works Malaria!""

Like, seriously. argument. works Malaria, must work COVID-19. Beyond fucking insane. Lol yes Giggity momma Well, yeah, good money spend insurance deductible funeral expenses. get saying HD try create image become attached think really matters end though. 

As younger person see HD brand connected hard right wing/white nationalist politics worse case, best look could HD something boomers buy sort life crisis. would never buy one, would never buy wear anything branded them. feel like kinda hit op brand arguably dead arrival young people. 

In general though believe whole recreation vehicle industry fucked. young person 20k+ blow toy economy shit young people everyone excessive student loans pay. You‚Äôre wrong bit nuanced. it‚Äôs freezing NE, especially ice snow, you‚Äôre likely going bar often, you‚Äôre going outdoor gatherings often, participate anything else would BRING virus. 

However, it‚Äôs really hot, yes, you‚Äôll stay inside often, also go beach reasonably deal heat festivals concerts. aren‚Äôt options NE winter aren‚Äôt many opportunities clustered gatherings could get virus someone outside household. airborne contagions R0s significantly lower measles covid19. Many properties factor efficently airborne pathogen infect someone. Nice sentiment. fuck off. Platitudes tired. gotten far genuinely come conclusion clue vulnerable? Serious question dude. It‚Äôs everywhere. People 65, obese, diabetic, immunocompromised. Tall reckless, ugly seed It‚Äôs still highest it‚Äôs long time cause concern long term. would / interesting see measures place, correlation measures number infections deaths different countries. data facts science eventually delivers, likely prove facts; facts whole bunch people wish never made public. isn‚Äôt true politicians. get politicians vote for. People keep choosing bad politicians. behind someone fast moving ride breathing copious amounts virus they‚Äôve expelled lungs yelling yeah eradication horse bolted long ago think seen it. might watch mention it. Outbreak good too! surprise criminal justice system allows increments fun&amp;games intending kill someone? call ‚Äúrivals‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt open source? Everything I've seen points Phase 3 trials least 3 vaccines wrapping Sept Oct approved public. Oxford's already produced, I'm sure Moderna's Pfizer's. prediction high-risk individuals able get vaccine months rest us mild low-risk wait beginning 2021. high risk would healthcare workers, retail workers anybody deals lot people everyday. Even vaccinating would deal big blow virus since able spread easily. signed Pfizer trials today hopefully I'll get in. opinions pandemic end eventually, hang there. 


I know TLDR there's lot say lol in-laws often struggle pandemic overload information. mad ‚Äúscientists keep changing mind‚Äù. FIL says fauci ‚Äúalways wrong‚Äù keep coming new information sometimes contradicts older findings. 

My in-laws actually science background, done undergrad chemistry biology, spent working years business field. take covid seriously, don‚Äôt understand scientific process. struggle parsing research that‚Äôs churning out. throw hands air hear yet another new finding. husband MDs feel shouldn‚Äôt take graduate level education understand scientific process. failing educational system. ... yes.  studies like this. example device capture virus air. try reproduce (breed it) virus can't. determine ""dead"" virus air. difficult determine virus air viable infect people. Look justice system like half europe Ron Deathsantence strikes ! guy face bothers lot thx Uh no, don't. That's entire problem. knew would catch virus wouldn't, virus would contained LONG time ago. hard handle pandemic country like Mexico cant really afford keep economy shut long people starve type person deserves bloody face. otherhand, predator children, Disney world well is.

Most child predators become summer camp/scout leaders. internet, dial up. can‚Äôt fancy things like Skype send nudes see edited comment replied. Nice strategy try make look bad. Sorry, personal mental health takes back seat population's physical health risk. 

A low-risk unnecessary activity like beach still risk need taken, especially consider activities likely occur people following protocol. Good call. Wish taken long, least tens thousands people stands come August 23rd. haven‚Äôt seen disinfecting wipes store since whole thing started. pop amazon sometimes 2 3+ times regular price bullshit. 

They convenient plenty cleaners available use reusable cloths cheaper less wasteful anyway. long they're less 1% population! /s could just, ya know, educate keep safe... thats political enough... you‚Äôre wrong highly suspicious press releases proclaiming unverifiable results drugs haven‚Äôt gotten real, meaningful results scientific trials yet. primarily podcast; one listen sections, throughout week. titles segment breakdowns episode website. 

635 - Mask Hysteria might good episode. best keep listening things still learnt virus.

I'm pointing get information, direct virologists, instead newspapers/MSM suffer [Gell-Mann Amnesia 

Do info will. I‚Äôll give school two weeks close again. Probably less That's absolutely mind-blowing me. hate you, partner everyone may effected unnecessary risk. I'm area US hit hard, special needs children social work caseload primarily quarantine since March. even check-ins virtually avoid possible risk. realize individuals special needs truly could tolerate mask, imagine rare exception rule.

On feeling like crazy one: you. One biggest regrets life advocating harder someone loved make proactive medical decision. subsequently died, I've struggled ever knowing everything could save him. I'm advocate everything do. may enough, makes world difference know tried.  Oddly agree McConnell, covid-19 measures included bill. Honestly, US time fuck around. going start seeing people struggle, since $600 expired. don‚Äôt understand one day peaks significant one day troughs forgot meaning behind numbers. 

Death permanent condition.  think may [maligning goldfish] comparison.  conservatives ones want bring class back. Notice title says Georgia. ones want teachers sit home lazy students allowed go class. Stupid ass school system Hahahaha says bro thinks United states america thing dollar. 


Roflmao üòÇü§£üò≠üòÇü§£üò≠

Thanks laugh hahaha Okay, sexist. nothing covid-19, disease 100 years ago. Yeah. know people told bad idea. true fashion, ignored advisors counted incredible, huge intellect, wit, ability outsmart press. And, well, yeah. Especially much Florida halted testing couple days ago due hurricane (I'm guessing southern coastal states/cities too). I'm pregnant US comments therapeutic read. :) 

Length maternity (or parental) leave mostly employers, although people work companies 50+ people year, government mandates cannot take job away (with exceptions) optional 12 week leave. Leave may paid enough vacation time, company sick leave, law mandates unpaid leave protects job. 

As example, could take 16 weeks unpaid (due state law), employer offers 2 wks paid, use vacation time, go unpaid.  flip side, companies amazing, like husband's company offers 16 weeks paid leave.  critical thinking opinion

Is call lack empathy? still problem, even stomp foot point finger go ""no you!"" Yeah let's attack woman leave Fauci hook. Sexist much? Statements like fall FDA territory medical claims thus force company making claims invest time money producing tests hard evidence support claims FDA.

Many companies choose delete words products. Purell already got trouble hand sanitizer claims: letter purell: Ok, well, here's nation's most-trusted infectious disease expert telling Congress children certain age certainly spread day, friend. seems foolish think keeping kids enclosed building 5+ hours day shared ventilation lead non-significant outbreak Covid. highly-infectious nature Covid, get vulnerable population easily children sent back school en masse. 8-year old kids (or younger) learning lecture even classroom going home, either. Kids young taught anything they'd learn school home; it'd far productive schedule sessions parents teachers children age try classroom teach children video conferencing, generally done anyway.  
   
It's sort silly gets talked either/or thing, kids either going class school learning. Home schooling thing, particularly younger kids ignored effective short term alternative Covid many people view sending kids school equivalent daycare. Nobody? can't possibly say that. think got pretty good education high school, even though joke compared college classes. least USA, important remember companies benefit lockdowns (ie Amazon) ones benefit businesses open.

Only naive person would think CNN, MSNBC pocket one side FOX News WSJ pocket other.

Remember country world sees ""locking vaccine"" viable exit strategy.  need stop electing people based popularity contest size wallet start electing people positions actually experience fields. tell people face face want fight. one seem grasp idea modern soldiers dont fight pur freedom. understand science - snake oil? called doctors read Reddit troll bots messaging reinfection?? Can't hapoen, fake news. Btw, herd immunity troll bots? problem! :) Haha see see. Thanks, take care! Hope good week.  Florida alone testing throws data off.  kidding me? data shows teenagers dying Covid? First, Bernie. need deflect.

Second, polling really convinced everyone Trump would lose first time. fact, Clinton popular vote still win presidency.

Third, election important, seems rather odd DNC went candidate. Regardless personally feel, controversial statement call pick seem reflection climate. That‚Äôs virus coming winter peak, people indoors north. opposite happening southern summer now. People come indoors spread virus order beat heat. 

If it‚Äôs around rampant community begin spread people don‚Äôt teleport protests raves. travel, eat, use bathrooms, increase odds exposing everyone. eventually come indoors even lose masks time time. It‚Äôs happening NYC virus flattened extent. Check back October protests gatherings continue bright side, least punch/stab/shoot anyone mask policy. Ya, bar getting pretty low days. stating government policy - didn‚Äôt look like opinion 1) behaviors change population even there‚Äôs government rules changing them

2) people get infected, lower transmission rate going forward.  you‚Äôre dealing exponential growth transmission rates right around 1.0, even small difference take 1 least died knowing alphabet... Dude, dare ruin cheap shot OrnGE MaN BAdding damn facts? fuck mean ""Post Covid-19"" right minute?  


I think see went wrong. still know long term ramifications virus even survived. went small midwestern high school (500 students) several teachers multiple morbidities. experienced teachers administrators would faced highest risk, ones would left building without part ones (shame us) routinely reduced tears fun. barely imagine locked us alone. German model placing students ‚Äútrack‚Äù based aptitude performance would never fly US. inherently anti-individualistic even lowest-performing students would never accept put track 4-year universities.

I assume would also plagued claims discrimination tracking low-performing minority students technical schools. I'm going respond bad faith arguments. I've Angola strict it, country. significant deadly outbreak recent memory. realize peoples lives semi-pause. Agreed, I'm certain hard run team. like fancy someone would valuable asset team, think strength would lie GM. think could provide high level analysis players, I'm sure would translate playing better. good chance I'd make terrible coach. 

Because I'm familiar league's reluctance go 4th, go 2 point conversion, spending kicker, low hanging fruit I'm aware terms 'Moneyball.' that's done that's left shaving little pay positions paying positions little more. Hardly Dunning-Kruger effect.

I'll concede everything 3 mentioned items. lot opinions solid ground 3. especially evident whenever hear QB talking post game interview. ""Yea saw player X cheating outside player aggressive side field. left weak side field wide open slant calling Spider 2 Banana. easy call easier touchdown."" think could analysis dedicated craft, certainly close know exactly why. back envelope calculation

It'll take couple hours reading written research, exists. 538 puts lot excellent football stats it. Here's one really liked, especially graphs go 1 vs 2 time left someone leading expert field paid handsomely - experts often know far less average people expect. real possibility dozens people every org pitching 3 items coaches GM's getting ignored 1 2 folks actually make decisions. Yep, easy survive America idiot scumbag keep existing  far many people (like one you‚Äôre responding to) claim ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing could done better‚Äù 

Just like said, look country (besides Brazil Russia) see handle better currently. never one claim even made. russians must find fucking hilarious many people duped believing president russian asset, talk someone else job lol

Why would lie something easily disproven simply scrolling country political divide never going heal start meeting people middle one.

Thankfully country, need try convince eyes lying me.

[You, hand, could stand take Hell, entire comment chain started literally went way start something, know it. FL testing  There's life able breathe. interesting leftists favor ""do everything live"" abandon argument comes abortion demand. Porque los dos? Seems states (TN) objective: dumb dead Whoa. given great idea motivating politicians! 

Now, get infected... referring ""English"" issue much pedantic.

Both. Well little countries close borders get cases down. need deaducation. Murican lies propaganda late. lots blood hands.  Don‚Äôt paint us brush. lots us do. üòÅ maybe differences it‚Äôs applied

Correct. knowledge courts tend concerned surety good supervision plan meets court's requirements release anything else. Beyond bail fee here, there's 'posting bail' front someone released. someone breaches bail conditions might cash property collected court. new Mars probe launched, it‚Äôs already possible. important point note. southern US, summers act winters northern parts, forcing people inside. 

It's possible winter actually improve situation people south, increase risk spread northern states. wearing mask...this could avoided. Koreans: kekekekekekekeke Hmm well I've heard two strains virus, recent mutation infectious. there's chance caught first strain initially bad, got second infectious one. know/believe one gives immunity other. even taken world view, plague biblical?

Who says see way? Nothing worry about; surely God spare faithful. I'm referencing scientists studied issue done contact tracing studies.

The Wired article huge list papers references. Read paragraph again, click also wealth evidence children transmit virus rate adults. experts note precise transmission dynamics children, children adults, ‚Äúnot well understood‚Äù‚Äîand indeed, argue best evidence question ‚Äúwe enough evidence‚Äù‚Äîmany tend think risk contagion diminished. Jonas F. Ludvigsson, pediatrician professor clinical epidemiology Sweden‚Äôs Karolinska Institute, reviewed relevant research literature May 11 concluded that, it‚Äôs ‚Äúhighly likely‚Äù children transmit virus causing Covid-19, ‚Äúseldom cause outbreaks.‚Äù World Health Organization‚Äôs chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, suggested last month ‚Äúit seem know children less capable spreading‚Äù disease, Kristine Macartney, director Australia's National Centre Immunisation Research Surveillance, noted lack evidence school-aged children superspreaders country. study Ireland found ‚Äúno evidence secondary transmission Covid-19 children attending school.‚Äù K√°ri Stef√°nsson, leading researcher Iceland, told New Yorker 56,000 residents tested, ‚Äúthere two examples child infected parent. lots examples parents infected children.‚Äù Similar conclusions drawn study families Netherlands. Ecuador 17 million people, 88k cases, 6k deaths

China   1393 million people , 84k cases, 5k deaths (origin pandemic)

Mhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............. noticed mention word ""science"" time lol simple, pretty disingenuous imply is.

A lot school districts forced open threats funding cuts government. Many states require (legally) children attending school open. kids school now. Can't say agree you. Also, teachers seem hopeless frustrated lack empowerment. Behind paywall:

Coronavirus Stimulus Proposals Aren‚Äôt Limited Coronavirus Spending
Wish lists lawmakers, White House include new FBI building, repealing SALT tax caps, financial access marijuana businesses
As negotiators work iron compromise unemployment payments, school funding pressing matters related coronavirus pandemic, Republicans Democrats also trying weed items say nothing outbreak.
The latest stimulus package expected run north $1 trillion, large bills Congress inevitably attract spending proposals little nothing core thrust legislation. time‚Äîand much else expected get passed election‚Äîsome lawmakers President Trump included pet projects parties‚Äô plans hopes survive eventual deal.

How Republican Democratic Plans Compare
They met cool reception. Democrats criticized items pushed White House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said opposed measures closely connected pandemic relief‚Äîwhether came Democrats Republicans.
‚ÄúWhen get end process would hope non-Covid related measures out, matter bills start,‚Äù said.
Here‚Äôs look could chopping block‚Äîor might stay bargaining chip another priority.
FROM SENATE GOP BILL RELEASED LAST WEEK:
--$1.75 billion build new Federal Bureau Investigation headquarters downtown Washington
The Trump administration abruptly canceled plans 2017 build suburban FBI campus. Instead, pushed keep agency‚Äôs current downtown location, saying officials wanted remain across street main Justice Department building, White House pushing funds construct new building. Keeping FBI downtown would prevent redevelopment site, near Trump International Hotel.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R., Okla.) said stimulus bill isn‚Äôt ideal place military spending, military needs every opportunity possible rebuilding.
FROM DEMOCRATIC BILL PASSED HOUSE MAY:
--Repeal $10,000 cap state local tax deduction 2020 2021
In 2017 tax overhaul, Republicans placed $10,000 cap amount state local taxes taxpayers deduct federal taxable income. Governors high-tax states New York New Jersey want Congress eliminate cap. would help constituents, make easier raise state local taxes reduce incentives people move lower-taxed states. Repealing limit would also deliver direct tax cuts high-income households, top 1% households would get 57% benefits, according Tax Policy Center. ‚ÄúWe need cushion blow virus. SALT cap hurts people affected virus,‚Äù Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said New York last month. ‚ÄúIt hurts many metropolitan areas like New York.‚Äù
--Banking access marijuana businesses
The provision would protect financial institutions serve marijuana businesses states substance legal. Federally insured depository institutions prohibited offering financial services businesses pot illegal federal law, forcing companies deal primarily cash. Supporters say proposal would make easier legitimate marijuana businesses conduct transactions without cash, making safer pandemic. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree cannabis related this. therapy proven successful,‚Äù House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said last week asked reporters proposal. virus recognize state borders. don‚Äôt mind asking, take five minutes would taken reading him, see awful person is, bad idea was? sip then. Yep soon restaurants reopened state, friend like ""meet olive garden lunch""

Hell naw girl, love I'm getting covid bread sticks Stop spreading this. plenty real problems get mad about. need get mad things understand them. someone explain states FL GA starting see decline cases deaths even though shutdown vast majority people wear masks? share theory children getting sick larger numbers largely kept home. Given way numbers reported now, id say US ""below"" 10k cases day end month, seriously look numbers, like 

4 days ago 71k cases 1400 dead, 

2 days ago 49k cases 467 dead,

1 day ago 48k cases 567 dead, 

Everyone said soon CDC bypassed numbers would screwed with, looks like coming true, keep messing numbers range suits them, people got get smart keeping safe. Fair enough. 
I‚Äôve seen many people say they‚Äôve seen many women personally think there‚Äôs men, it‚Äôs toooo much more.

Surely they'll defunding schools, structuring educations based 'what always did' instead want focus placed individual needs students.

Certainly they'll care students actually better remote learning without, push students way.

The far right depends ignorant people giving benefit doubt. Netherlands, first mink confirmed COVID-19, veterinarians owners mink farms begged government testing. think took weeks first tests done. enough testing capacity.

Have seen signals like pig farms, outbreaks among staff pig farms. Find things give life meaning. Maybe work yourself?  unreasonable think additional measures states taken starting make difference, hard say. sure seeing ""record low"" cases, though. Freedom choice ends actions start harm others. free choice slip knife ribs? No? course isn't. Fat chance that. We're screwed. Treating employees properly sick pay time beneficial everyone.

Oh sweet summer child! it'll interesting see data changes week. honestly living arizona, texas, florida knew taking week even get test 10 days get results, bother starting process, already scheduled would probably it, naturally couple weeks much less people getting tested would result less positives. 

deaths i'm sure make of, trust much anyway since seem dropping bunches randomly call backlog. know....the fact billionaire white men sell trade minorities literal auction make hurt destroy bodies brains majority white fan base. lady cookoo Cocoa Puffs, Dr. Fauci playing (very) long con

The stupid thing 30% Americans believe latter regardless evidence rational thought. kids live outside doghouse? Yep. area primed bad event, unless citizens get stuff together take appropriate precautions. doesn‚Äôt make less American, makes good neighbor key Midwestern ethos. Great, single use masks single use wipes.  


I hate humans. got crazy parents, too. quite much renown but..... heyoooo! completely normal lose family member young, especially multiple family members, lots friends losing family members too. Kids take isolation 7 months. fine. Texas reporting positives separately though? still useful information Actually Florida men go boat there...new policy. sad happened. lot commuting across border throughout 2020, mostly Danes Swedes living Sweden working Denmark, also Danes working Sweden. 

Some parts Malm√∂ like Copehagen suburb.

I think debunked ‚Äú20% foreigners since reopening borders‚Äù claim now. reporting numbers properly isn‚Äôt cover up? don‚Äôt think know talking about. reporting numbers cover up.

To expect instructed entire US start making homemade masks early march knew hundred sick people absurd. 

Sure, done that, everyone listened, might better now, also possible northeast would gotten way fucked healthcare workers literally access proper masks. prevent students getting sick spreading it? Students contact people outside school like families friends Growing orphan damaging. Daycares open across country. statistics far? Several large outbreaks US chicken processing plants, fair bit away pigs biologically. insurance cover flu shots. premium 200 dollars month. clear trend, see something breaking trend, can't immediately point what's important cause differences vast, probably thing actually breaking trend. think aren‚Äôt getting infected? wear mask every time exit room

Do AC? protests infect people. Sounds like great you!!! green...gold...silver... Seems like would fit perfect ‚Äústick-in-the-bike-spokes‚Äù meme. retarded? would make one anti racist?

I think understand, dumb think way out. delete posts dummy. Imagine investing effort keep child alive. triple organ transplant means teams doctors worked hours parents spending weeks months hospital watching child suffer, trying every imaginable course action keep alive. cut child's little body open, removed failing organs, replaced donation tragedy destroyed family. work, dedication, sacrifice one little boy, give chance life. pain little Derryk went through, chance stay alive grow up.

He died assholes Nebraska care enough Derryk Ramirez-Lopez put mask. simple double-layer cotton fabric could saved Derryk. much ask people, ones value defending warped concept personal freedom saving little boy's life.

If want gamble, guess.  shouldn‚Äôt wearing masks house, coming house all. Tell killing mother that, dies never forgive giving preemptive ‚Äútold dumb motherfucker‚Äù beforehand. Horrible thing happened kid one thing parents didn‚Äôt right live healthier maybe loose weight. Unfortunately that‚Äôs big contributor covid death really overwhelming completely swamped, set like busy market hub anyway, extent crowds worked aesthetic. There's something look everywhere go, big SW fan, worth reading sites like Theme Park Insider easter eggs lesser-known activities. example, room mate really character Thrawn, there's specific bar blaster mark one walls that's reference shot fired one novels.

A Karen, full adult. Generally people forgiving gathering good cause circumstances (human rights marches, school children, long lines food medical treatment, voting). I‚Äôd even agree media treatment anti-lockdown protests vs. treatment blm protests unfair. People upset losing livelihoods equal rights make grievances known, derided.

However people less accepting gathering hedonism, indulgence, pleasure. head Lake Ozarks swim, get drunk, party etc. isn‚Äôt necessary, even justifiable risk. It‚Äôs pure selfishness stupidity good reason. token, protests ends getting haircuts indoor hamburgers equally frivolous laughable. public interaction carries risk, going behind barrier, wearing mask, preferably following guidance hygiene, improve chances quite bit. I'm dreading school openings fall, even kids. news already seems increasing stories dead kids teenagers covid.

Keep us pesky infected Americans friends wear one cold consideration. ""Eventually digital certificates show recovered tested recently vaccine received it,"" - bill gates Alabama here.

Whatever say r/beholdthemasterrace subscriber. Yes, bend facts profit. hand, expensive antibody based IL-6 targeting drugs failing trials. it?

I think COVID lot public scrutiny used dealing with: entire stock market indexes moved Remdesivir trial results. play stupid games either whole world decides blot existence drug harm good, whole world decides nationalize patents drug works charge much.

How antagonistic?  think political, case knowledge increasing time information becomes available? see family likely last year two earth? That's better. choice, anyone chooses attend making choice well. need stop trying dictate demand others live lives. Put shoes second. wants see family can. ask believe something little supporting evidence much evidence it. sources garbage.

Portraying hydroxychloroquine forbidden cure allows pro-Trump media blame anyone Trump coronavirus disaster. telling, COVID-19 could cured months ago hydroxychloroquine, Democrats, media, Dr. Anthony Fauci would listened Trump! üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Username checks Open stupid zoom get actual work done (without sending internal emails).

No, absolutely not, would that. foolish thing do. scientists consider fortunately extremely unlikely. It‚Äôs interesting theoretical discussion, Earth would planning situation?

By way, realize way people getting infected infected people, right? unless going lab, infected virus, kept solitary confinement 2 weeks, there‚Äôs real chance could spread others ‚Äúgood deed‚Äù Nice. Shit, he's me! Right now, course dumb dead. interesting thing control Sweden's response current government weak. coalition holding government actually 33.2% seats votes. 

The Social democrats actually kicked Left Party, formally ""Left Party - Communists"" government assumed would support default. deal Liberal People's Party Centre Party would support government kicked lefties. Together lefties grumpily voting them, got budgets passed. 

If parties stop agreeing government they're currently apart of, could hold vote confidence kick time support right. 

The governments play throw ball Public Health Agency Sweden tell full, complete control. Whatever response recommend, government make law. 

I think scientist always like say ""listen scientists"", usually people like say. job raise every possible risk make people aware consequences. someone else making decisions, easy study find shut air traffic would reduce cases 90%, tell people charge fact. 

Give scientists actual reins, really like that. like telling people making decisions do, make decision themselves, lot doubt may want run another study bit cautious deciding. like longer see human.

What concerns mere mortals billionaires lying hordes gold. kind reasoning exactly airtight.

For one, months since pandemic began. Second, possible people confirmed case covid much likely careful comes wearing masks social distancing, cutting probability reexposure.

I hope reinfection unlikely, think it'll take bit time comfortable conclusion. agree school best place kids hate hearing teachers school administrators overpaid taking care educating kids corporate executives making millions eat chicken nuggets latest greatest drive-in fast food restaurant.  get religious ""walk mile someone else's shoes passing judgement."" DISCLAIMER: teacher, play one television. money goes wrong places. Middle men said. Rather actual teachers things need educate kids. almost 250 deaths today? paying vaccine tax dollars. Every American spent $50 vaccines pre-ordered paid government. why? Russia America now? looks like allow inside, come get pet wait. little awkward since take bus, doable. Yeah, shit. It‚Äôs time publicly shame them. people type like this. irritating eyes. That's I'm thinking, warehousing. way virtual set up, need internet home, unfortunately, actual district child care 54 spots year.

However, think difficulty virtual learning stems institutional problems, teacher ability. Like said post, schools equalizers. students laptops home reliable wifi parent cares check them, successful. students well-off access wifi devices home. They're also high schoolers.

I would hope experience virtual learning would make society value teachers more. no. we're sent dangerous situations could easily mitigated. entire school year Covid-19. kids go back school think death rate climb? closed schools March keep infections down. School super spreader event. really need see many kids kill? flu. totally new threat dealt believe we're anywhere near ready deal it. poor ceo, let guys hes ceo ""Misleading"" respect? conclusion think I'm misled to? None bullet points, agree principle, debate notion deaths surprisingly low teenage population. one suggesting teenagers take knowledge use foundation wild summer COVID parties. people understand anything importance fucking tired pretending case. 

No problem nation facing COVID-19 thoroughly summed tweet soundbite, that's 60% population capable thinking in. 

And worst, absolute **fucking worst** part people chihuahua attention spans disdain education **are loudest insistent** headline fueled armchair expert opinion valid people _literally_ highly complex job _decades_. 

I hate Idiocracy 1) turned documentary, 2) turned underestimate final extent problem. part seems wrong I‚Äôm pretty sure gathering size illegal right California.  ‚ÄúThe LAPD told ABC7 nothing could earlier partygoers breaking laws, they're enforcing health code violations.‚Äù course, I‚Äôve actually changed diet stopped smoking cigarettes. eat lean meats, veggies fruits. Water teas üòÉ virtual pre-recorded lessons, come flash drive. set way accessible students without internet. lessons pre-recorded, assignments typed turned via wi-fi hot spots (including buses, stop along predetermined routes student needs submission.) virtual option requires 30-120 minutes per day. It‚Äôs like ACTUAL experts doctors warning months... Nah China's done virus. reckoning truly American virus now.   think entire NFL vaccine trial subjects. recoveries active cases US. Thought would share positive news since sub doesn‚Äôt lot.  know plays out. Virus gets passed around, people get sick impossible run educational program. We'll weeks road Federal Govt still plan ever... stop counting.

Same thing opening economy. strategy *Some day disappear*. *Like Miracle*. That's motto US govt students long I've alive. change now? lot people known while.

I've advised everyone know masks essential piece protection. going get one thing right, let mask.

I walk around full gas mask 7093 3m filters though lot issue isn‚Äôt income infrastructure. It‚Äôs expensive run line companies don‚Äôt run tiny towns well highway. Satellite Internet scam right we‚Äôll families data caps set really low along expensive slow.

We REALLY need Starlink viable option kind support lower income students. educator able take away excuses work done. would like know due hoarding corporate level. I'm thinking grocery store chains piles wipes hand one-pass wipe 25 shopping cart basket handles say carts sanitized. Even though giving handle single wipe disinfecting wipe disinfect handle anything, since even bleach/lysol products need sit wet surface anywhere 20 seconds minutes actually kill quota viruses bacteria. That's they're trying avoid guess. compulsory children go school September (in UK). theory nobody stay home educate children. would rather kids working home rest year see pans tbh get fine like would mean slightly less crowding schools people nope expected go back September. Young people nice lungs hearts compensate lot better older people. young protective covid. mortality rate much higher get older add comorbidities.

Kids also spread around faster adults given school policies. kid living 60 year old puts 60 year old much greater risk. know testing sites closed sarcastic scale income something , tickets etc 
But yeah big portion Americans get watching Americans get sentenced escalator moment new jumping shark. Yes Agreed shit. I‚Äôm rural East Tennessee every vet around isn‚Äôt allowing people inside. know people constantly bitching Facebook idiots. Good luck cat. mean, that‚Äôs valuation subjective. Comparing Sweden 10 million people US it‚Äôs 330 million people kind silly first place. Sweden worse places better other. parts US barely touched March/April, bad despite extra time prepare. still well. country, think US largely seems squandered time big parts got prepare current wave. I'm original post, Sprague said doctor's appointment nearby entered Pier 1 order cool down. feel important otherwise people questioning high risk person would shopping thus victim blaming. soon wont sure? can't sing shower anymore. ü•∫ run breath first line. devastating. NFL season going epic fail.  I‚Äôm sure try start it, within month over. low death rate young person misleading.

- Young people fight virus better, survive, still sick weeks months. 

- Young people still catch virus much older people, show less symptoms work force, infect people, unaware sick.

- still unsure long term effects seems like even mild cases might get neurological damage.

- Finally, put 'value' life span, young people's life valuable older ones, means losing 1 young person, might worst let say, loosing five 70+ year old.

and I'm probably forgetting something original comment useless contribution took offense. dare try tell mean???????  6ft thing needs die already. People think they're invincible they're standing apart. like 5 second rule epidemiology; arbitrary, based science, easy understand people latch onto it.  Bleach stains. Ok let‚Äôs talk flu then. child ever dies flu? inevitably going die go work (indoor office) store? thought masks social distancing worked. mean people could go Applebees could roll actual testing strategy bailout bill protects businesses. easy, one ever said would be. Much rest world risen occasion. spend time arguing masks ""deep state"". rude, reading comprehension must lacking. 

Take care. misconception happens reason. 

When test positive, can‚Äôt stay column forever. moved recovered, moved dead. That‚Äôs it. options. mild case covid get car accident, would first counted part death toll. death certificate issued, would corrected would removed death toll. That‚Äôs extremely small discrepancies every then. can‚Äôt find right now, Orlando Sentinel reported one month ago. One. one. Even though occasional truly odd death might attributed covid, it‚Äôs amended. discrepancy nowhere close number people die without officially diagnosed. 

Does happen? Yes, it‚Äôs really rare it‚Äôs statistically significant. Didnt guys ~~phones~~ guns? /s exactly harm others, infected? first world country free. quite. Fauci, example, let‚Äôs groceries sit day rather sanitizing them. 

Sanitizing quick solution slightly reduce risk. ‚Äúconfirmed diagnosis‚Äù literally based online survey many never even seeing medical professional person.

This still statistically significant difference unless think would reason would report different large, random, double blind study? ignores research done hospitals benefit found among thousands confirmed COVID patients. work. I'm 50s, us remember Great Recession happened teaching positions years followed. Quitting anticipation job waiting vaccine year two, could mean able land job years due reduction force hiring freezes. Experienced teachers also expensive, passed younger teacher less experience degrees offered position less steps (years service) possible too. offered step 5 10 20+. due agism, district simply can't afford hire conditions. there's potential health risk in-person, think lot us gambling we're going get corona schools going remote sooner later (if school year starts) thus we're better taking short term risk versus potentially losing serious lifetime earnings. assuming someone afford quit too. Lol walk back top medical professional goes national broadcast says it. amazing administration refuses accept reality yet parents area, parent 2 school age kids, really angry School Boards decision start year virtual learning. keep blaming Teachers, writing nasty things whole FB twitter. pretty nasty way behaving toward them, teachers protest, right 2 work state. I'm small town options limited. COVID Island fall demographics main buckets mortality yes, that‚Äôs huge amount school aged parents though.  chance. Americans way incompetent. New Orleans councilman: 'ÔªøI would rather students **\*uneducated** alive educated dead' Funny, another weirdo blogging testosterone caused higher fatality rate dealing COVID. sound pretty bogus me. Please refrain putting words mouth. dirty. kids would risk. disease incredibly targeted older population. California 1 person 18 died nearly 50000 cases age group.

Yes America citizen. lived south Texas whole life. whole family, Americans. 2012 brother TB lived everyone house hold got TB. take medicine year health department periodically brother take chest x-ray see TB activated again. upset take medicine year took it. medicine basically builds wall around germ body's one day health might decline get older we, might become activated. aware symptoms see activated not. take chest x-ray instead TB skin test , like apply jobs require TB test jobs medical field ect. Everything see TV coronavirus reminds much TB, contact tracing ect. brother COPD alot scar tissue Tuberculosis aware go around pick coronavirus. insurance work. remains seen covers new vaccines not. could still get there, know that, right? titanic failure. wonder people confused. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting downvoted.

The city district (77% minority, large percentage poverty) spends almost exactly per pupil richest suburban district (96% white, average income $100k+/year).

Obviously outcomes drastically different. practical proposition young child isolate. saying anyone child lives home child practically required exposed. can't ""avoid"" exposure sending child school. kids themselves. Good point, neither. said, knew SARS 1 could infect ferrets least, ferrets mink family, likely mink pigs (which IIRC SARS 1 found in). 

Now ofc absence evidence evidence absence, wise investigate every possible transmission vector closely. *needs* investigated. bit odd yet. DC southern vibe. even close. looked photos empty Disney World I'd go Florida. Getting rides without 2 hour wait would worth risk me. I'm already going work (indoor office) mask social distancing, I'd outdoor theme park. way without contact tracing depends entirely timely testing, still woefully inadequate . complete disgrace still going six months happened Gordon Ramsay show woman said food bad, kept eating it! told woman ‚ÄúPiss ya‚Äù

LOL Get cat rabies vaccine. Find one many vets aren‚Äôt allowing non-staff facility. Veterinarians strangers infectious disease protocols.

Annual well visits proven beneficial long term health companion animals. can't believe going dumb dead. where's 5g come in? similar hospital setting too. always drill us hand washing sanitizer, totally true good practice. course still situations conducive full wash. Businesses making available encourage customer use absolutely great use case. Boot well licked.  worn mask, become pissed off. Instead, wear one, got pissy told wear one, stole cigars opened fire. Sounds like went downhill told needed wear mask article about. Try compare something Sweden sized peaked already (like Massachusetts). Someone hold phone sun magnifying glass see read sharpie Mr. Agent NUST KNOW TRUTH like idea better. Neither. They're states health departments. gonna happen bars restaurants still open dining in, parents still send kids camps schools. house neighborhood swimming classes summer, lots cars come every day. seems like ppl don‚Äôt think kids might get COVID-19. Dr. Carson take teaching high school Biology. Nobody idea. Nobody. alone that. Unfortunately still incredibly shitty required school board let know intention reason. 40,000 100,000 responding school board idea many teachers allow work home vs mandating teach person. mom, medically exempt person teaching, idea whether she'll asked return not. asked return she'll retire teach all. There's hundreds teachers district likely make decision. mass confusion ignoring whole thing anyone favors. Woah woah Bernie sanders. Reign back buddy Hm... wonder that‚Äôs feeling shift takes place it‚Äôs going move north east second wave. It‚Äôs strange! kid, swear conservatives class. Federal Government scamming country pump-n-dump pump-n-dump. name specific vaccine company names press conferences like they‚Äôre stock broker. hate timeline. dumb, uneducated reason American mess. Catch 22 Sorry I‚Äôm Italy lives Scotland USA, said. Haha, yeah thanks definitely I‚Äôll use words effect never seen freeze dried cheesy rice though. talk shit cause scene try make leave? Good luck, would've left household ago. Godspeed catches ventilated know hell inflicted thousands insane fuck. no, soemthing like giant gift card Baskin Robbins. know, something important shit think every nation world creating extra hospitals right now? realize virus grow exponentially unbounded, right? humans plenty things stop growth say ‚Äúoh grow exponentially forever let‚Äôs build hospitals‚Äù ADA provide blanket protection. provide reasonable accommodations saying mask. Offering option wear face shield instead offering curbside pickup satisfy ADA laws. good news cases death tolls falling. know believe anymore WH shenanigans CDC moving data reporting direct HHS.  almost like hurricanes change paths, increase strength rapidly times, hard predict something...

the point US states didnt want solve issue, european approach laundry dirty clothes countries comunicate worked Good them. No, I'm worried that. wear mask, touch face wash hands get home. People getting surface transmission, high doses virus prolonged contact someone. I'm far worried grocery store 15 minutes surface transmission. think changed Sandy Hook? take parents workforce? would result huge decrease national productivity. Teaching kids school way efficient use resources home, even kids taught remotely. likely, state mental health care country (England) America I‚Äôve seen absolutely abysmal long time. 

This going stretch already funded, prepared NHS sector unfortunately projecting recognize we're stressful pattern.

And yes objectively hostile.

I reflection US government. US government care people. serve people. do. live one rural counties? mean something like Nobel Prize Physiology Medicine? others pointed out, title misleading makes sound like one flight. Per article: ""They spread 21 different flights, Eindhovens Dagblad reported."" actually choice politicians trying hard avoid virtual school vaccine.

What happen smattering of:

1) kids (the majority likely) lose year minimum

Yuppp. local district, starting salary three teachers equal superintendent. Plus, district super small FOUR total administrators. Don‚Äôt forget sports team coaches!  link subject matter exactly Let's real, America. Nobody educated school. There's literally reason make kids go back based freeing parents return work. ghouls done nothing attack education decades suddenly important. Fuck murderous greedy pieces shit. hope bad things happen every single one upsets anyone wonder they're even reading reddit fours licking boots fascist government that's trying kill children extract every last drop profit sinking ship flew better check pay. Otherwise, misrepresenting kind job has... 

There low income areas teachers make low income like that, jobs part special programs incentives (like provided housing, student loan forgiveness, etc) 

Source: mom taught couple kinds schools. could taught elsewhere net pay, incentives made difference financially. reports coming CDC anymore numbers WH now? Sure, many people going beach actually taking precautions?

The original context thread poster saying he/she keeps getting hit friends go beach feel safe. exactly encouraging things like going beach, can't assume everyone take proper precautions. sounds like people hitting OP precautions based perceived it. According science, would still living went school

you believe science, right disagree. works, results nearly good. Haha sometimes. think use really incendiary language obvious talking points easier spot, challenge. Basically anyone arguing non nuanced way definitely particular side using degrading language side dead giveaway. really care I'm wrong sometimes, still take stuff grain salt. Yeah think Covid also makes roll saves disadvantage $50k nothing multi-millionaires. Like stop bad behavior. That‚Äôs like $5 them. Next conspiracy nut mentions implants send link this:  Even kids homeschooled, whether parents, local school, online program, still missing lot. Like others said, socialization important children, mostly younger ones. last two years HS online definitely negatively affected physical classroom. main point going school educated, helps development well. live county. 15 minutes ago announced re-opening person school August 26... Even US locked completely, would stifle wave 1. 

Yes. Let's this. seems nice. see objection taking wave wave approach. countless infection pockets worldwide eventually spread uninfected regions long international travel continues.

Yes no. China done outstanding job screening arrivals think options could help contain importing virus.

No country done bad US terms cases deaths strong indicators effective containment measures. Again, completely utterly wrong counts here. 

Back anecdote, bringing bits clearly even bother read response. oldest entering grade 12. They've NEVER good time class learning. work them, absolute fucking hell getting high school... environment, poor impulse control, terrible attention, completely frozen comes studying getting work done. abnormal whatsoever.

Self directed remote learning home put environment could actually learn in. Complete 180 degree 8 year olds younger struggle pay attention, get bored watching online lecture eventually need adult step help focus them.

Damned need stop talking. know first thing kids, bottom line they're human beings _vastly_ different. One mine age range could actually handle hours lectures day. other, chance.

But, BIG here, right fucking mind would ever even remotely think online learning school aged children would include _any_ sitting watching online lectures. JFK.

Your generalizations shit place conversation going come proper successful solutions existing new challenges educating children. latest CDC data shows deaths age. 135,579 covid-19 deaths United States, 221 occured people aged 5-24.

That's 1.63 deaths per 1000 deaths, one-sixteenth one percent, occurring people within ages 5-24. could narrow age range 5-17, would almost certainly less tenth one percent.

My point death covid-19 extremely unlikely among school age children. Obviously, children live adults 65 (edit: children compromised immune systems, etc.) treated additional caution, fear stated title **massively unwarranted**.

Wear mask, wash hands, social distance, lose heads thinking children everywhere dying simply aren't, according latest data, use cellphone doorknobs. worry excess water would damage both. 7% checking antibody immunity several months, T-cell immunity (which unknown, terms prevalence significance).

And main point even infection rate 7% (Florida currently around 2% confirmed signs letting up) unlikely mean similar number deaths hospitalizations time round, we've got better dealing Covid time gone on. really know read, say Dave bud Uhh...kids higher chance dying lightning than...lmao

w/e, reddit. upvotes right Sunday Monday always less cases deaths course not, [Redacted] either. That's obvious one everyone misses. see they're fake, going [Redacted] never again. kinda unsettling. Ah yes. voluntary, mitigation employer. Whereas across board, option employer deal it. society fucked making fucked. White Jesus save them.  understand counterpoint. major EU East Asian countries vastly superior responses compared US well ""tiny"" island nations. every single student held back year isnt going make dumb. argument students returning school getting worse worse See fact get one life led behave I'm still phase 1 lock down. go work (masks worn every time anyone else area, let UPS, FED EX USPS office mask not, leave boxes outside) grocery store. go out, socialize, work, home repeat. 

I refuse possibly die I'm bit bored stir crazy. refuse kill elderly parents live me, need vacation.  wipe everything commonly touched every single day home multiple times work. treat people (even roommate) contagious let anyone get within 6 feet without mask.  see unmasked store turn around avoid them. leave store entirely. worth death lifetime respiratory issues. says suspended, fine can‚Äôt 50k. likely won‚Äôt able play refuse testing (but one missed test may fine instead suspension). 1 day total equate confirmed good news, especially Monday FL/TX reporting problems.  I've saying Reddit, people like hear it. Kids extremely unlikely die virus, there's really strong chance keeping home like might kill COVID would've. honest, even educating children well pandemic. I'm college now, took almost dozen classes online various reasons as, more, thorough person classes could use financial aid scholarships towards like person classes. That's likely administrators politicians making reforms, instead experts like psychologists educators avoid killing kids families, should. apologize saying that. I've lived DC years feels much culture-less - much less southern. Culture-less way walking around certain NYC neighborhoods, like Tribeca, feel.  DC lacks large base multigenerational residents cities like Philly, Boston, outer-borough NYC have.

Just know, forget this. never vote made masks mandatory pushing never friends speak. fractured society would pushed apart.

But yeah, wear mask. Shhh. interrupt ignorant conspiracy circle-jerk. teachers back school wearing masks face shields. even understand school. taught online home 4th qtr, baffles forced go back school teach online. Shame people dont take seriously. Assholes many developed countries (like Ireland Poland) antivaxx population large enough bring herd immunity levels. states must reporting data, storms causing disruptions data makes sense. COvid-19 DNA snippet HIV attacks t-cells, means immunity subsequent reinfections severe damaged lungs eventually would mean death. US 4x world average deaths per capita, pessimists fine then? thought widespread vaccination way stop pandemic. not?

Deaths case counts always come directly state health departments continue so. certain threshold positive cases

Any threshold zero negligent. Opening schools conditions absurd. going lead disaster. pattern going repeat every school. time notice shut down, already hundreds super-spreader events. COvid-19 DNA snippet HIV attacks t-cells, means immunity subsequent reinfections severe eventually would mean death. hope 10 kids get eat well #1 covid! even make sense logically. telling hire women 79c every man's dollar exact job exact output, would hire females day. obviously case. Let correct said - even less difference that. recent data shows .98 1 Nope, lots pressure report key states south rise again... keep us laughing stock international stage. realize we've reporting less new cases past week nationally right? Upvote you, Branson absolutely sucks.  thanks italics spam buddy, made sound real smart happening RIGHT outside Chicago- tiny Bible Belt town. blows cause Chicagoans working super hard we‚Äôve avoided lot big spikes.

Taken single case, agree - open fire police, returning fire reasonable (whether _best_ thing far questionable, depend lot case question - e.g. single shot, still firing? warning shot/scare tactic, clear intent kill/injure?)

What appears damning, though, black Americans seem[1] end dead often white Americans even fire police. that's accurate, would suggestive problem even individual shooting justified (it would suggest shootings justifiable could resolved non-lethally, racial component it).

JaVale McGee (Lakers): Thybulle (76ers): already riots means OK Trump fuel stupid words?

We get it, like fire analogy. like protests.

We've even got fancy article newspaper, oh boy.

Now, way...can finally explain Trump trolling protests things like posting videos supporters yelling ""white power"" rile anything irresponsible?

Funny love harping responsibility, seem want apply person supposed charge. people make adulthood dense? would support government paying people ""sit around day."" spreading virus. million people dead would mean million people working population, means unemployment decrease. Lowest unemployment decade!

-White House Secretary come September know except lockdown require masks, still done. Oh yah disassemble pandemic response team year earlier.  'looking horror"" not? point top. Let's sensationalist.

I personally, living Melbourne, think top. 

Note comparing covid flu sense assuming. Though see may think given number covid deniers there. Sure deaths aged care bad matter cause. pointing given action taken already number deaths far beyond average year due flu. let burn aged care 30x average number deaths. calling hundreds flu deaths horror would calling happened far horror either.

Anyway. sounds essentially agree. Personally would still take living Melbourne countries moment. That's clinical trials for. phase III trial pfizer vaccine 80,000 volunteers. Rushed mean unsafe. reactions, phase III trial tell us. HIV vaccines never made phase III trial. phase II trials test vaccine safe. caused severe reactions, straight would made phase III. phase III tests dose long takes get immunity.

No virus history entire world much money resources poured finding vaccine. vaccines tested *already* worked human volunteers. basically using hypotheticals already proven wrong. get say he's feels like million bucks. turn complete moron dreams can't manage put face mask on, matter hard try. keeps falling hook behind ears. government singular shady entity power unilaterally manipulate covid case/death reporting. decide longer trust aggregate data coming out, better ironclad rationale clear proof. Otherwise creating version reality can't disproven, like 5G conspiracy Bill Gates microchip crowd. German study showed virus infectious 26+ feet. He‚Äôs sad, angry old man loosing knows it. Ad hominem help make point.

Unless point one tuberculosis vaccine highly contagious love People hear wdw think masses it‚Äôs limited capacity right now, perhaps low 20%. Social distancing markers everywhere, masks required, dining low capacity, strict enforcement, constant sanitation. I‚Äôve read first hand reports they‚Äôre safer places US. defending go people safe don‚Äôt see issue. Use ammonia-based concentrate dilute water (5-8 oz per gallon H2O), essentially thing Lysol spray. lot smell really nasty do, favorite OdoBan Disinfectant Fresh Linen Scent, [Home Depot carries Go anything now? course. Go much overrides benefits kids school. I'm sure.  counties low levels new positive cases countries opened schools countries experienced problems due openings. 

But I'm going pretend risk. charge everything, see schools going back person anywhere country outside NE. counties including low enough levels that's think trying open schools using lessons countries. 

Here's interesting reading countries schools open various Trump? No, meant Satan shielding Trump, DeSantis, Kemp Abbot felled virus. way continue grand plan make fucking nightmare worse. Erm... One question, bodies? number high hide bodies. Virtual learning shifts lot financial time burden education parents. Yet still paying taxes kids' educations. getting tax break/credit compensate. Yeah, perfect site, story interesting.

Or problem right wing based? Holy shit mother 10? Yeah pandemic widen already cosmic wealth gap guess gives bigots/racists/xenophobes someone blame opposed chaotic uncontrollable nature life (and death) uhhh finds way. guy work bitching wear mask roller coasters six flags like ""why fuck would wear mask roller coaster, going fly off!?"" like ""why fuck would go amusement park pandemic?"" guy cover nose required masks work straight told give shit people. Like used grandparent example response one dead almost dead care. Selfish assholes like really piss off. I'm misanthrope I'm going endanger people's lives. still hate people mask. good news anyone? Maybe fake, lol.  People act like quarantine new cases virus gone safe end quarantine.

That isn‚Äôt correct pre-symptomatic people asymptomatic people. Even massive individual collective action may enough (which aren‚Äôt anyway), may wait years wide spread vaccine become available. Even then, we‚Äôd better vaccine effective enough. Like sex, best way get virus stay put get exposed.

This 2020. Well he‚Äôs dumb alive. agree reduced influenza. People still wearing masks live (NY). trains still relatively empty according friends (I won‚Äôt get one). lot businesses field WFH next year. think back April May reported wipes would restocked mid-July. textbook industry. They‚Äôre printing money basically charge whatever want regulation. definitely challenging parents, instead opening Schools program provides homes children monthly stipend one parent stay home, also insuring employers give priority rehiring control more. person Schools right can't solution. numbers judt keep climbing, eventually medical facilities max out. can‚Äôt discuss personal choice resposibility sub upsidedown world children primary vector od spread.

It says hear way, means that. hear meaning since insult. replaced word neutral adjective hear meaning all.

IQ big dummy sports teams kind like jet skis billionaires, IMHO. sort get owners somewhat subject vagarities humanity, falling well spoken QB (or even thinking ""white"", old might want be.) 

but im sure much harder run team think. I've thought ever since 12 smarter coaches. think standing yelling ""you idiot"" unconventional choice plays failed. I've around long enough ""be coach"" similar situations; situations know harder looks, people yelling ""you idiot"" way oversimplifying they're swimming lane. 

Maybe think dumb throw I-formation. coach team **fantastic running game**, throws I-formation like 20% time, almost always less 5 yards. I'm screaming, ""STOP PUTTING HALF RECEIVERS COLUMN, IDIOT!!!"" TV... never dawns defensive coordinator assistants looking film. guys noticed teams throw I-formation. defensive coordinator started stacking line teams spreadsheet results. He's shared coach offensive coordinator. know low yardage, remember fantastic running game mentioned? teams stacking line we're I-formation, film guys, too. passing I-formation, they've calculated cost four six drives entire season, small potatoes compared fact they're running deep defenses year. hold beers yelling ""hurr durr throw 'I' "", they're 2 3 levels deep us. may even reasons zero visibility to, like lineman fatigue something.

What's RRR? Reading, Riting Rithmatic? Lol (honestly never heard that). I'm sure either professions benefit containing virus. considered essential essential careers fully prohibited working, although, I'm sure many might opt working could maintain benefits pay do.

I'm also sure either profession positions power. People largely politically powerless rarely consulted policy. Actually SARS-Cov-2, SARS-Cov-1 first SARS early 2000's... Yep. People going get together Thanksgiving Christmas. get togethers doors cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

We got together 4th July - everyone stayed outside sat huge circle folding chairs 6 feet apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've gone one two restaurants socially distanced outdoor seating. going happen winter. We've also seen breweries/wineries allowing outdoor seating well. Can't winter either. 

You still able go see movies, etc. 

People already dislike cold darkness winter seek solace social gatherings friends - can't imagine people going literally sit alone dark rooms winter long, there's going almost zero socially distanced recreational things do. Well, they're dead, educated? agree though Germany, Holland, Denmark went back school spring, didn‚Äôt record single case transmission students students teachers.

The argument keep kids home isn‚Äôt based observed reality funny government asking us reduce obesity help fight coronavirus too. want eat big macs not??? states know local areas best, problem is, get support. Oh. worry. majority Germans think protestors last weekend shitheads welcome restricting ability spread virus. But, restricting freedoms sensitive topic Germany.. especially considering things got started 90 years ago. People much afraid happening again, thus wary kind restrictions unless absolutely necessary clear rules restrictions lifted again.  token, adoptable mom? predictable, loving, germaphobic sane preventing spread Covid way, give great air hugs, respect people opinions....and mention excess love brownies!!

I‚Äôm sure alternatives education experts figure ways make things work. really think that's saying. think surprised low number general .Don't take everything like attack. Jesus Christ, think seriously considering moving US earlier point career. Here, 20 vacation days + unlimited sick leave minimal legal standard, give tenfold increase pay. say flu. look countries reopen schools. Super spreader event not, Israel example exactly 0 deaths among children. spread schools reopening, deaths. current strategy reopening schools younger kids keeping high schools remote learning since deadlier older kids. think sensible. nothing approach useful.  recommended masks last week public transport. remember telling friends last week want extra cautious need start pushing masks ahead, yet are... Everyone loves extremely painful solutions like eternal social distancing, suggest something merely *unorthodox* like tearing windows public buses teaching kids outside field turn noses. Ducey forced allow masks. allow local government chose instead blanket mask. allowed anything doctors signed mass petitions mayors stood ground.
He also may open soon see marvellous wizard DC week. do. mean, go reasons, too, great food. Especially world showcase Epcot. forget rebuilding schools. 'rona know least 3 local schools rebuilt. I'd love see money comes much district spending facilitating remote learning. know new idea. know without potential flaws. would address monies provided in-kind assure every student received relative access.

Having said that, believe Federal Department Education returned pre 1979 status ""Office"" Human Services rather continue cabinet level position. think understand President Carter's thinking time, become way powerful way bureaucratic.

Previous 1979, function ensure equitable distribution federal monies maintain statistical analysis ensure funding applied should. dictate curriculum, etc. article prime example federal mandate local wishes. interesting interactive article missing deaths Covid19. countries really seem undercount deaths Sweden pretty accurate comparison  least provided humor. rag soap water enough. virus lipid layer breaks soap. Clorox wipes needed. hand sanitizer. My, my, defensive. Taking everything personal attack, looks like blowing smoke seems. Still American, all. know life get rough one things sure. least don‚Äôt live Florida. odds beat

People die, person died older average, thereby beating odds several years prior death. Police said trend included so-called ""sovereign citizens"" - espouse anti-government ideology - confronting officers.

If wanna sovereign, better expect able use government ran healthcare treat COVID. gave away miles. years spent 200 365 days traveling.  enjoyed every minute spent vacations home. I'm sure end well Marxism scare WASPs, scared WASP Marxister is. wasteful product. much plastic. spray bottle bleach solution rag works well. Use paper towels really paranoid clean something super gross. Question: Daily deaths fallen last days. 

Could result numbers getting wonky Feds took control stats CDC? 

I thought could suppress testing numbers death numbers? lucky get US.

I think even government offers 2 weeks employees. sister in-law use sick vacation leave get more.

A lot private/industry employers really offer all, *have* use accrued sick-leave. Eh Europe, things rising still... seen kids thrive MI school. bullies, sleep, better meals, learning help home, learning lifeskills. 
Plenty hugs socializing, drug pushers, sex encounters. FaceTime,ect ‚Äúsee‚Äù friends. 
And agree! start kids panic implement home school? freaking it! You‚Äôre joking right?  Well, seem strange quickly positive tests deaths dropping. Perhaps people careful. said, expect another large wave Thanksgiving Christmas holidays. lots family get togethers kids returning college. understand sentiment. do.

But dumb alive got us first place. saw spray yesterday, can‚Äôt find replacement scrubbies dish soap dispensing wand. People across country need set swap system. canceled trip end year want COVID, want vacation restrictions. can't even park hopper right now. Florida heat face mask day sounds miserable. friends now, though. change works. curve always flat. think hilarious Canadians reddit acting high mighty Americans trying get in, Americans stupid selfish enough that. Surely Canadians imperfect creatures? shift slope downward occurred day HHS started running show. 

You take want. Deaths still high ratio deaths new cases broken literally every reported body somehow different America.

It‚Äôs obviously cooking books, people struggle basic mathematics tell it‚Äôs black swanning. 

The proof numbers and, hate making statements, takes special kind relentless stupid see it. Oh bet. DC 19 tho. Dumb alive got stage begin with. kid going school open knowing sick disease infectious showing symptoms isn‚Äôt fault never blamed it.

Someone willingly going bar party times despite sick, however (or even they‚Äôre really sick taking precautions), absolutely fault decisions. Context matters. current state education system ""dumb alive dumb dead"". outside years. still needs rabies vaccination though. saying need 0 dead kids? ok kids dying flu previous years? advocating shutting schools prevent flu-induced carnage? republican base, unfortunately mostly christians think ""pray"" covid away them. 

Also, neutral reason returning kids school parents probably starting go crazy around kids long, hence push lot ""parents"" send kids back.

Also... corporate greed... Money kinda trumps things...  Oh news want see that...... original argument concedes defends disparities.

My reply highlighted defended disparities translate reality.

It's strawman. Hah. Haha. Bahahahah people downvoting guy amazed 7 18 died Florida, realize less 30 minors died whole USA?

Why downvote everything isn‚Äôt fear porn? Glad could help achieve self importance. Way keep civil, friendo! Cases dropped 6%, testing dropped 7%. Well done you‚Äôve Googled couple magazine articles. 

Please explain they‚Äôre anyway relevant study you‚Äôre undermining? 

As far see relevance whatsoever. first seems utterly irrelevant. second describes extremely rare edge case bearing new treatment absolute overwhelming majority cases also essentially irrelevant. 

The fact you‚Äôre linking random magazine articles instead making actual scientific argument clearly shows don‚Äôt understand depth whatsoever. everyone drives separately, go eat, picnic, lay beach sunbathing... maybe. Calling overreaction still pretty lame though, thanking people staying home, insulting them. vast majority people, ""going beach"" swimming. agree go, turning additional activities becomes even challenging. Also, one example.

It better stay home. apparently we're *really* ""post COVID-19"" since would imply we've past it. Cases growing sharply many European countries Yeah, know upstate NY trying too.

Also, use small quotes Wikipedia understand study. Look study itself, Wikipedia graciously cites. study, replicate expand Baye Monseur‚Äôs work, explore greater male variability country using meta-analysis meta-regression. broadly confirm variability greater males internationally, find significant heterogeneity countries, much quantified using variables applicable across assessments (such test, year, male‚Äìfemale effect size, mean country score Global Gender Gap Indicators). still possible make causal conclusions regarding males varied females academic assessments, possible show national level variables effect magnitude variation. Results suggestions work discussed.

The authors **confirm existence variability hypothesis findings support it.** Monseur (2016) also examined variance ratios boys girls assessments found 93% cases, variances boys higher. finding greater male variances assessments original noted studies many decades (although rarely core focus).

The authors highlight long history overwhelming evidence support variability hypothesis. 

And here's begin broadly confirm previous works Baye Monseur (2016) suggest male variances greater female variances geographical areas study show significantly greater female variances. would seem therefore question currently longer be, male female variances differ, much varied males compared say confidence males certainly varied generate fairly precise estimate global average, cannot come absolute value country individually must contend large amount theoretical perspective, cannot contribute causal explanations males variable. Data suggests effect almost universal, which, supportive biological evolutionary theories, doesn‚Äôt rule specific cultural, educational, political, social religious practices. Indeed, fact quantify substantial variation dependent increased female participation society suggests that, least educational outcomes, necessarily case males vary without clear understanding males vary difference maintained, acknowledge meaningful discussion regarding done ensure parity difficult. Increased female participation economy, education political empowerment significantly reduce size discrepancy variances males females across three educational domains studied here. increase, might expect variance gap decrease. specific practices within countries enabling however discernible existing data, comparative, in-depth work within nations (with closer attention specific educational practices) would required specific policy recommendations could formulated ensure parity males females across ability distribution.

They're saying variability hypothesis wrong. they're 

1. Reaffirming existence, universal level

2. Questioning cause

3. Attempt quantify countries less gap why

4. Thinking maybe culture plays *some* role countries smaller (but still significant gaps)

5. Concluding putting women high workforce positions lessen (but eliminate) gap.

6. Scratching heads math logic reasoning scores still universally favoring men, despite initiatives get women STEM despite education predominantly favor women.

Remember summer camp opened Georgia almost half staff attendees caught 'rona?

The kicker: half staff attendees first felt symptoms Friday. symptoms pretty mild, come go. feel 100% hour two feel like slept years another hour two.

My symptoms are: sore throat, occasionally cough, major fatigue brain fog, fever dreams (but fever), muscle aches arms shoulders, pressure sinuses ears.

If fatigue brain fog prevalent, even think sick. really feel sick time.

As far picked from, I'm clueless. wearing mask staying isolated much possible since March. go store every couple weeks get food delivered via drive times week (always wearing mask). live apartment possible maybe picked door handle something since fairly large complex, knows. really tough know. put ""high risk"" situations all. Using logic, outlaw automobiles leading cause death people aged 0-19. 

See dumb sounds use actual logic feelings? 

I also guarantee child deaths covid even 1% that. Actually school board administrators even really fighting this; terrified astronomical amount dropouts withdrawal funding.

You used 'speculatory' language whatsoever. common theme posts today whatever reason, obvious.

PS: speculating, literally discussing recent facts side effects caused COVID. think Spanish Flu special case. often history anyone allow thousands soldiers die flu place (far away front line) keep shipping soldiers die there? put gas-attack victims next infected pigs, flu evolved kill gas-attack victims put every day, slowly got better better killing healthy soldiers. √âtaples might well concentration camp. Plenty healthy soldiers got executed MPs too. wonder tried keep secret afterword. dumb people, world needs.

God's work never done David gets people said would impressive 30 true, I'm ember Completely. suggest listen [This Week insightful stuff. Went Bible camp 20 years ago middle school aged. remote conservative town mountains CO. kicking screaming wanting go thinking away video games week, ended 80% fun. Dreaded hardcore religious sermons big tent. That's closest got whole Jesus camp documentary, nothing extreme. think every night hour two remember right. counselors tasked ""Jesus told special"" talk late camp. thought little funny heard one exact talk someone else sneaking around one night. 

Other shit load fun I'm glad went despite wanting go initially tbh. snuck lot, raided girls' cabins, raided ours, shaving cream war them, food actually good, played lot pool main cabin, archery, ziplines, tons outdoorsy shit, really getting relax woods alone friends pretty nice.  beautiful concept. bad live nation (yes, one) whose unique cultural word practice *gofuckyourself* thing started, shut schools, part kids stayed home. means kids exposed virus much adults. adults still worked, many shopping left kids home. protected lot children virus.

We forget pulled kids one environment causes illness almost other. Normally family, get flu cold spring, daughter pulled school sick long time.

Parents know school starts, flu cold season starts kids bring illnesses home.

We going find kids incredible vectors disease actually saved ton lives pulling kids schools spring. Thompson said 12-year-old son among learned infected coronavirus attending Trout Creek. spent week bible camp tested positive July 21, four days left.  said son‚Äôs experience completely changed mind whether K-12 schools restart in-person classes fall.

Parents surprised despite totally predictable. kids start going back person schools, stories everywhere weeks. parents absolutely freak wide scale. I'd laugh serious. mark date calendar see long takes see next headline makes sense. hear saying definitely agree, impoverished families screwed lack in-person schooling parents already exposed 8-10 hours day. parents essential workers. wish could agree no-win situation. long lasting structural damage seeing recovered patient's brains, brain fog suffer from, really point educating virus impairs ability think Honestly, think that's accurate fair comparison. None diseases became established anywhere world beyond originated. say, ""It's Obama awesome"" covid end getting established pretty much every single country world. every single leader suddenly become grossly incompetent handling diseases perfectly? No. different virulent disease.

Let's realistic here, could've done differently? Covid got Europe getting China. Shutting borders completely travel back Jan Feb (which done it) would've seen paranoid overkill covid probably would've snuck returning US citizens overseas. know current administration former ones could've done anything prevent covid getting US. deemed flight risk (or risk public safety) denying bail fine, point granting bail condition able pay insane. nothing keep poor marginalized prison despite presumption innocence. getting downvoted?
I guess trump-drones can't handle fucking basic truth Things rising Vermont level New Hampshire level Europe. AKA situation would dream vast majority American states. sound like seen Colorado ... speculating Covid-19 infections causing mental health issues. responded speculation saying increase mental health problems likely related lockdown. chimed insult say ignoring facts. responding facts all, responding speculation. rude reason. reopening schools even considered right now? outbreaks hit hard fast, thousands lives lost, they‚Äôll forced shut soon. anyone really think they‚Äôll able make whole school year without shutting down? There‚Äôs absolutely way. Opening schools bad idea

In NYC going done differently done Israel. blended model social distancing masks required (both kids teachers). kids class 2-3 times week allow social distancing. hope work. virtual school terrible kids. Complete waste time. happened without kids buildings too. teacher work days. Deaducated. Starring Simon Pegg, Nick Frost Glenda Jackson.

LOL, magically disappear /s Thanks link.

One frustrating thing outbreak response much numbers fudged various ways political purposes. disappointing. first inclination yell out, ""Step back!"" ""Get me!"" says ‚Äî reactions exactly polite, they're likely escalate Instead, says, try use words like ""we"" ""us"" request. example, ""Let's put little bit space we're waiting line."" 

What load hogwash. tell anti-maskers FUCK OFF. see reason polite toxic people. someone endangering life, courtesy apply. 

Here another way handle it. Everybody form circle around maskless guy, point yell ""UNCLEAN! UNCLEAN!"" leaves. Tror att de flesta beh√∂ver ha n√•gon n√§rst√•ende som blir rej√§lt d√•lig/d√∂r innan de tar det p√• allvar tyv√§rr.

And lot districts requiring teachers report buildings online teaching schools instead home. foolish shows total lack respect teachers. Plus lot schools internet capabilities smoothly stream many lessons once.  education country bottom priority list. Schooling exists parents continue wage-slaves. trauma even limited children. I'd fucking traumatized life brought home COVID killed parents way... Nope. players union going agree punishment system NFL, I'd assume going base pay players receive NFL pay top level players receive outside sources - including basing something like endorsements fluid typically guaranteed money. intent punishments correct behavior, crush people make bad choice.

Again, $50,000 extremely close 1/17 median player wage (median well average due handful people making outsized pile money compared most). strange would select amount equal median salary per game season...

And also suspended. suppose happens player's salary suspended? lose salary per game suspended. Btw don‚Äôt need mask either, they‚Äôre bad health definitely shouldn‚Äôt wear one, go it! person flogged publicly example Clearly wrong Hopkins smart assumed were.  really. death numbers kids pretty low.

Also, lot teachers they‚Äôre lazy don‚Äôt want go work, still want paid tax money. work hard pay taxes leeches almost nothing. I'm gonna say Europe handling things optimally, standard ""total mess"" different US standard. states US right middle-of-the pack terms outbreak severity see residents politicians cautiously optimistic. Let's take state like Minnesota example. 

If dropped state Western Europe, would plague center region. would run laps terms infections per capita around currently worst performing countries. Minnesota gets new cases total France, multiple times Italy, despite countries dwarfing terms population.

The region US could fit Europe right New England, even would one currently worst performing areas.

If went bondsman, yes, keep 10% paying them, paying everything end What're charges tested positive? Maybe one ""predict"" it, key questions answered last weeks, make educated guesses autumn winter might go.

Questions better answers to: 

1) kids catch spread virus mostly like adults can? Apparently, yes. viral loads may even many times higher typical adult. Additionally, kids basically 7th grade(ish) essentially adults far virus transmissibility concerned.

2) warm weather tend dampen suppress virus? Nope... least Texas, Florida, California, etc., indication. possible warm weather pushing people inside air conditioning contributed spread. Still, research seems indicate outdoors open, somewhere good airflow, safest, obviously impossible places autumn winter.

Though Fauci absolutely correct -- no, none us accurately *predict* happen fall winter -- can, based two things, plus fact schools opening almost normally many places, plus fact lockdown fatigue clearly taken hold many more, make educated guesses. 

Here's educated guess: total fucking shit-show, tens thousands needless deaths, millions needless infections, trillions dollars needless medical bills, hundreds thousands extra medical bankruptcies.

Okay, turn! Go ahead, take guesses. much fun! /s

Seriously, though, September March going really, really suck. comes money rules everything. I'm doctor bit OCD comes learning things, take grain salt... oxygen saturation meter working, that's excellent oxygen level, good news you. going since March, symptoms, oxygen levels looking good, could anxiety related, alone feeling way. stressful times board. found healthy outlet relieve stress? talked doctor? can't even imagine frustrating putting life line people willfully ignorant. Every selfish asshole thinks kills old serious disease one contagious body facility around. Bless commitment even give shit you. could believe many people state acting dumb wearing masks posted something Facebook close friends family members respond post trying defend anti-maskers, none legitimate reason wear mask ""MuH FrEeDoMs"". Like shit absolutely ridiculous understand anybody education like that.

I'm standing full tyvek gear closet waiting shit really hit fan. live Central Florida hear nothing governor, businesses can't enforce everyone wear masks, tons people still parading around going restaurants large parties, gathering large crowds beaches, general shitshow. think people think ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù, think someone nursing home hospital bed. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs average joe happens fat high blood pressure.  That's reason billion people dying every day...?  Florida woman village, would starve. hut would move center eaten bear. point bringing money mix reduce chances fleeing... Pretty much. Everything going back normal now. mean? Sorry no.  People way knowing violent anti-maskers history shooting people masks. kinda like last bit getting tested. I‚Äôm sorry, pandemic. ‚ÄúNo harm, foul‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work situation, particularly state could compared entire countries number cases.

Jersey natives aren‚Äôt exactly k ow class intelligence. 
A big part NJ people NY Philly buy homes commute work. That‚Äôs real estate tax high. Well would hope 3 years later. Man genius. No, I'm saying twenty kids put work.

I'm saying noticeable number women seem want pregnant decades lives purpose extra farm hands alternative available. I‚Äôm defending Fed people ignorant understand Fed works. vast majority people US don‚Äôt know difference fiscal monetary policy. don‚Äôt know rules govern Fed mandates are. 

To clear, Fed‚Äôs mandates (1) maximize employment (2) stabilize consumer prices. buy safe assets, bonds agency mortgage backed securities. able buy corporate bonds help Treasury, taking liability. cannot give grants people. also set rates already reached lower bound lost tool.

The even bigger problem Americans idea Fed works, Congress knows full well works. inaction lead predictable response Fed make richer. world accepting herd immunity ethical route world live in?

It‚Äôs like people say rate deforestation lower: no, ‚Äúnow we‚Äôre good situation.‚Äù It‚Äôs still ‚Äúon net, getting worse‚Äù situation.

The virus still spreading even spreads slightly slower rate. proportion positive tests *way* high ... everywhere. New York City populous city United States. Please use logic understand outbreak bad new York City. population New York City alone 8 million people. Great! Could point one papers you‚Äôve published subject? 

I‚Äôm excited, first come conclusion. It‚Äôs going huge news! one say partying cause here. Sorry things control on. can't enforce people meet party. certainly lots things control on. Partying seems quite risky luxury now, replaced fun stuff go find yourself. One less party less probability get exposed. won‚Äôt ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, soon vaccine comes people go back living normal lives, better worse. Spot POS American ^^^ Nightmare scenario? expect outcome made worse politics going especially Western world.

Eradication? fast mutating virus? work?

Never forget, infrastructure down, matter anymore virus does. 

Mankind survived mutations Corona virus family. Mankind - ruined - also survive mutation. Trump owes American families apology inaction control virus calling hoax. never happen. understand can't use bond amount without rest case, thank explaining none less. able breathe would cause PTSD?

As asthmatic intubated fully conscious, still remember feeling relief. also remember acute terror desperate need oxygen right happened. Micheal Osterholm said same. Flu mild year Southern Hemisphere  familiar fact vaccine COVID19, one flu? asked *coughing* different. can't make distinction please carry gun. Im glad said Im prescribed anxiety medicine I've ""physical symptoms"" anxiety mental part. frustrating Good! players goal win games. 
Most owners goal make money? need shithead, report it. Florida, pay 10% get get $ back.

So real bond digits.  take study figure people might little messed thinking die. Except can‚Äôt afford trips. Places like bring people everywhere contribute prolonged suffering vulnerable work protections jobs work. don‚Äôt go Disney vacation. world giving up. Looks like US ahead curve. wonder boost sales shortage never happen ends. Timmy gets car accident, Johnny end hospital broken arm it. Maybe outside US.

If it, we're game pieces divided government playing us. Yeah, I'm sure kids much better parents die Covid caught school. Great point vulnerable families careful, non vulnerable families? isolation

While that's true, he's able keep getting sick going airports high risk areas. middle ground? hard say constantly bombarded conspiracy theories spread top levels government supposed lead.

It matter buy, buy buy. always goes up. takes ever took money. go restaurants without paying crazy prices enter park? Sarcasm aside. always rules. majority us follow rules. need forced things. doctor says ""hey, there's pandemic. Wear mask fucking dipshit"" say, ""Thanks doc, will"". End story. Yet, see pandemic.

Sigh...those days gone. We'd done letting go flooding labor market. Two incomes per family norm means available workers value labor goes down.

We need massive cultural shift make one income per family something typical family could achieve, think that's happening time soon.

Not everyone position you. everyone afford work right now. everyone capable good educator. Current science shows R 1 eventually (not immediately) cause virus die out

COVID R 3 states. Reducing 50%, point contesting, enough get back normal

You need 1, whole country, solid period time. Otherwise, creep back you‚Äôll get additional waves virus

Maybe I‚Äôm missing something. halving R hot spots get us back normal? states 4, believe. Halving still going result widespread virus Bc American Exceptionality actually translates action American Infatilism. Holy crap. wrong, laughably wrong. Talk posting misinformation. unable obtain even basic understanding facts, understand accuse shifting goal posts.

Here's official New York numbers (I subscribe New York Times know paper record laughably wrong misreading data). can't even get peak right factor 5 (6?) weekly numbers. Without even math, obvious New York weekly numbers peak well 5,000 (and 3,500 include confirmed, suspected cases).

As hospital capacity stuff, plural anecdote data. We've hearing dire predictions Florida month (shit, literally posted article Florida 4 weeks ago governor already debunked - going post nonsense, least post recent nonsense. Health Insurance under? HPN? Good luck lady. completely fair best quickly accurately getting information public. Guys, chill out. Mondays figures always generally low due weekend. figures available states' respective health department website independently. Remember Arizona recorded -1 deaths Sunday reported 147 Tuesday?

Another lock differs state state save economy.

Children getting sick dying Coronavirus Trump tweeting ‚ÄúOpen Schools!!!‚Äù

I‚Äôll take children school let around Coronavirus used political pawns. even doctors nurses safe Coronavirus PPE schools do.  Huh, neat. 

It's stupid timing thing post got many votes. thinking measles better known public opinion, even though obviously perfect comparison. 

Norovirus aerosol makes certain amount sense, one time brother got entire house got even though everyone crazy careful hand washing. room throwing up. Weird. Decades long mystery solved. bunch words sound nice actually ring true. wrote. different schools, kids set begin high school nearby area 12th. One virtual school, attend person senior classes needs graduate offered virtually. ridiculous. point, I'm tempted pull let get GED. Hey! He's mutant/toddler hybrid, get right! [Only ~30 kids kidnapped Obviously it‚Äôs terrible anytime happens, it‚Äôs extremely rare phenomenon extreme precautions taken harm kids good.  country's shit forever. 

hell, even killed JFK. totally agree. One thing I've lately watching many [Walt Disney DVD collection. actually includes things like

 * Walt showing Disneyland going be
 * Friend Atom - educational film nuclear energy
 * Man Space - Real scientists 50s talking space travel would like (pretty accurate too)

But upsetting one watch full program Walt talks Florida Project, AKA Disney World. much planned EPCOT ever got built. watch it, see even EPCOT turned theme park, Walt's fingerprints it. Watching made understand much original design EPCOT. Walt WANTED educate people. WANTED influence technology. Towards end, believe entertainment brought funds wanted. 

It honestly watched episode Florida project realized much visionary Walt Disney was. Even today, majority wanted EPCOT still futuristic. instead, get current mess epcot becoming. put COVID positive people building

That could magnify sickness. mom friends her. Judy wacko (and mom, unfortunately). mom bunch people house tonight. Judy brought husband, coughing place, covering mouth, touching food putting back. fucking gross people.

Judy also wearing one fake ""I wear mask condition"" cards shirt. first thing said came was, ""If wear mask get flu vaccine, die!""

I'm healthcare worker. I'm already risk exposed, mom seems determined put even risk nut jobs time. Fortunately, mom leaving next week, although probably late anyway. I'm hiding room dog right now. I'm pissed. viral membrane graphic looks like dick. can't serious...

Ron DeSantis would climb inside Trump's skin could. parroting Trump's nonsense every step way. literally said someone told ""Florida best data"", gloated May beating virus. Everything Trump wants way.

All southern cowboy assholes whole ""economy dangerous virus"" thing, resisted mask mandates despite overwhelming evidence, TRUMP WANTS.

A governors deserve thrown jail, guy told do? Trump started whole fiasco calling hoax Democrats, thereby politicizing virus even acknowledged existence. empowers supports governors putting thousands people danger purpose. 

So yeah, blame him. Put human position, including one dickwad governors bad. Maybe Mitch McConnell one exception. I've wondering schools could create similar conditions infected children basically stewing germs poorly ventilated classrooms. ü§î Every week 9/11 half country denying it. Oh joy trapped floating rock demented apes. why? solved 4 months. virus cares calendar system. ""My escapism worth life."" entire TikTok community trying wipe out. They‚Äôre partying every day masks. too, speaks us all. ü§£ asking? never talking lockdowns. seems like changing subject upset idea ad-hoc science teacher stuff actually interested learning.

Do care think lockdowns, really? I'm economist, know better choice is. Certainly masks bannings large indoor gatherings go one vaccine virus burns out.

I'm NYC we're total lockdown, highest-risk activities banned masks mandatory. pretty livable

if idiots could stop ignoring recommendations spreading virus, could enjoying life like Taiwan NZ already one yellow fever vaccine volunteer work Peru.. new concept tbh common sense approach One schools area already closed outbreak summer classes Baseball bores death. Tragic case, student note doctor saying OK school. Turns **the date form wrong**.

What form wrong date discussed here? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* short video explains physics electrostatic mask layer thingy.  

Also seen guy's videos they're worth watching.  Baseball barely hanging on. teams played 3 games played 10. Blue Jays played 4 days now, half Marlins covid, bunch teams well. many games already cancelled 1 team big break out? imagine 4 5 teams big break outs like Marlins right. They're reporting anecdotal results emergency use drug. say 15 pateints outside trial. still see hopeful/good news. need data phase 1/2 clinical trials released. No, HHS collecting hospitalization data now, positive test results. common misconception. still spraying groceries? health officials say unnecessary? make unscented baby wipes disinfectant. make disinfectant spray alcohol, little hydrogen peroxide, drops lemon essential oil. Needs must, even though feel like Coronavirus pioneer woman. probably weep next time see Lysol store. french comic strip (my translation) ""I'd rather rich healthy poor sick!!!"" Huh, think waiting me. Wow. realized say man, geez. sort instant gratification typical Americans.

Also saying greed overrides fear? Well, well driving factor behind decision ""no kids die going school"" false equivalence. OP said "" talking human beings statistics "". want start comparing factors talk statistics.  


Yes flu vaccines. also lot known long term complications. death rate younger children flu higher COVID-19. Looking CDC numbers -  flu (with vaccines) killed 2.5X children aged 5-14. think overall data worth debating, arguments like ""How many dead children ok with"". Man Americans..... (sigh)

/end sarcasm Cool, telling specifically &amp; making comment thread this. Like never said agree disagree study? Self confidence, especially ""fake make it"" mentality prevalent, *is* narcissism... holding view oneself unearned unvalidated third party sources. That's true. routinely go hometown Appalachia. state county mandated masks, 60% compliance public unless, say, entered business required masks.

Now, much higher, see many people complaining.

Most people bothered masks. Less masks politicized. people making news tiny percentage. Fed works protect Wall Street. one corrupt institutions America Cult MAGA old people. also sick leave hohohohohihihhihihi unfortunately go Walmart day standing customer service line- one social distancing. stranger behind kept trying talk reason... People think masks make immune, it‚Äôs frustrating. Lmao 140 downvotes keep going. I'm going away. usually write something guys like, farm upvotes end using upvoted message something else. slaughterhouses country saying 'We following corona rules understand outbreaks'. 

Turns feel responsible way workers arrived work (usually many fit van) done workers direct employers (job agencies). Police shut one slaughterhouses day make em change mind. Yah instead planning now, taking reactive approach trusting way many people right thing. parents instead plan return work chaoticly pulled schools close weeks later.

 see can't provide additional funding families 1 parent stay home atleast while. Everyone listening ""this week virology (TWIV)"" podcast episode Friday believe, schools reopen need rapid tests. less efficient common argument, exactly they're supposed to, detect viral loads high enough considered contagious. vary much symptomatic vs symptomatic people's, regards amount virus shed. Viral loads matters pretty clear paths contagiousness time. Sure, someone could get negative rapid test still covid, stage, barely contagious, tomorrow next day rapid test would pick persons viral load high enough. 
Testing every single day teachers students. happen , possible. delay schools, load rapid tests start year, albeit later, less trauma higher level normalcy. rapid tests work exact way need work schools reopening. upfront cost high (but drop time making test becomes efficient less expensive) I'm astonished little rapid tests gaining momentum. 

I'm gonna send TWIV episode coordinator today hope get superintendent. they're stupid selfish guess understand argument, point freedoms get judge people use them. Either activities spread virus don't, there's justification taking away freedoms. Either let outdoor gatherings entertainment happen spread virus, protests severe spreading event looked upon. can't go ways one group drunken idiots claims fighting civil rights. Goldman Sachs never wrong, folks. Mental Health got left behind long time ago - death building wife got sick well. Lucky somewhat mild case - took month wife clear virus (multiple positive tests) doctor says there‚Äôs enough tests available screen prophylactically test symptoms. never heard regression? think teachers spend first month reteaching things. think special education students often go school year round. like hold everything learned 7 months. Every student experiences regression. many civilized countries moved towards year round school. would think humidity/ventilation/close quarters/buttons handles etc. probably contribute it. Well that's uncalled for....  really sunk yet around half million dead time next year??? Thanks explaining piling on. Anyone Reddit 15.. 11... older inn phase they're reexamining culture...

You‚Äôre saying governments around world different ideologies affiliations interests sudden (relatively speaking) - agreed, secret, logical discernable reason (other pure science protecting lives health pandemic) enforce masks? 

WOW

Mind absolutely fucking blown.

Oh let guess - whole world without elected leader MAGA, right? GEOTUS must smart worldwide fucking conspiracy, right?

Fucking stupid dumbass. think it‚Äôs silly think vaccine herd immunity. tell me. would virus behave unalike recorded virus history? able get case Kirkland brand ones couple weeks ago.

And sick days damn thing. sick year without problem. schools I‚Äôm aware force COVID vaccine

Can please show source this?  TX 7500 deaths, last checked

Edit: Speak fucking devil. yeah, fuck Texas moment time. 

The numbers largely accurate trusted such, especially since Fed told hospitals bypass CDC instead send numbers directly filter look like actually going good.

If anything look things Covid often times confused autopsy, notable Pneumonia, similar Kentucky really low death rate despite nearly 3x amount Pneumonia cases one year ever before. There's high likelihood hospitals full, morgues, means autopsies also done far often need done speed keep amount died. culminates enough tests thoroughly test workplaces, enough tests also test dead bodies would effective waste test regardless.

So, fully, blunt honest highly doubt 7,500 dead, *I wish was* highly unlikely whole. Even take supposed death rate countries account actually precautions apply Texas who, like Florida California, basically none, would still higher number.

So let's recap really trust state's numbers:

* state mathematically likely swing state go blue, largely held State Senate level team R, means failure federal level act Covid 19 prevent needless deaths harm state's likelihood going R.
* federal government intentionally stiffening reports information Covid 19 since beginning, starting discrediting things like social distancing, masks, discrediting head pandemic response, Dr Fauci alongside forcing states take actions directly harmful populace failing initiate proper, federal lockdown, limited threatening schools open else lose federal funding, spreading conspiracy theories notable lethal Covid 19 \[""It's bad flu""\] children effectively immune Covid 19 can't spread it.
* We've seen majority second house \[cause sub autoremove comment ""Too political"" we've already jumped metaphorical fucking shark virus 100% partisan stupid fucking reasons\] unified, current incumbent really direct danger losing seat bad Covid numbers would make tossup guarantee, playing somewhat key role whether team B gets control point.
* We've seen team R run states work actively *suppress* Covid numbers Kentucky, another state unlikely tossup stands decent shot actually unseating 2nd house rep. conundrum honest death toll taking actions Covid means Trump cult vote needs votes actually secure victory.

In reality political bullshit. +10 lead right going able account insanely high turnout using likely voters, die suffer means higher chance turn incumbent may vote opposite way, good someone seat running reelection. agree. I've heard theory since beginning believe it. extensive training masks respirators understand work. seeing politicians doctors say feel this. politicians doctors split effectiveness masks lockouts medicine etc. 

I'm sure goal feel political started as. people even know vaccines Hopefully nowadays. get it...you hate America Trending doooooowwwwnnnnn. IIRC time legitimate researcher time theory incorrect rather admitting wrong moving fabricated evidence everything went downhill since then. can't get socialisation jollies getting comment chains pointless arguments internet like normal person? worked well me. little early conclude reinfection can't thing, even assuming pertinent data date accurately available seems indicate much. know little long term effects aspects covid infection, immunity one. mean difference work constant testing shortage getting tested often voluntary US ordering people get vaccinated it‚Äôs different story adds data increasing picture ME/CFS post initial infection.

Sorry hear mom caught-up world. bright side, least you‚Äôve managed steer well clear. Stay safe. Weekend lag. Less people work weekend, backlog happens get spike typically Tuesday result backlog clearing. reduce testing everything fine! forget report WH CDC So, many people still get infected United States? TL;DR: ""The problem mix poor data culture bloated, corrupt bureaucracy,"" said Steve H. Hanke, professor Applied Economics.... ""Missing low-quality data always major problem attempting form public policy health -- -- field,"" said. ""It's equivalent pilot aircraft flying blind."" Lysol stay surfaces long period time, too.. Enhedslisten haven‚Äôt promoting masks prior mask mandate. they‚Äôre trying get political points fending poor. Nothing scientific it. 24+ children per classroom + 1 teacher, 3ft less other. There's possible way socially distance, everyone inside school day.

That's breeding ground Covid. unmitigated disaster schools open many people die life long health impacts direct result.

Out curiosity, Monday (or Tuesday reports Monday) low day? Well old men low testosterone vitamin D, it‚Äôs plausible. 

My ‚Äúalternative‚Äù Doc since low pay pocket HRT retired army. missed part poster indicated support blaming China COVID-19... people hand cough/sneeze blows mind.

What recommend then?

Sounds like good place competent government step set reasonable guidelines us follow, good us ALL.

Edit: get quick baseline viewpoint falls political spectrum, ask one question...

Agree disagree: everyone takes care themselves, everyone taken care of. never dealt 8 year olds you? 

Reality getting kids certain age learn online pipedream best. Kids certain age need constant active supervision learn effectively. 

High school kids online learning problem younger kids learn online. believe that, question whether casual chats meeting sans mask. Sheriffs Association meeting. sheriffs, associated them, anti-mask. flu coinciding people hospitals dealing upper respiratory infections. 

With hospitals already capacity, mortality COVID flu issues like pneumonia go up. 

Not that, outdoor things people opt summer option winter. people avoided others summer start giving peer pressure things people indoors. say aim 250,000 deaths Numbers always lower Sunday Monday. go back March see that's case. US already 3/5 deaths today yesterday. happens every week. May better normalize tax money goes. IIRC California this.

Itemizing flattening school tax regressive also adds resentment people without school aged children since visible tax money goes something benefiting (yes, okay, people rational). never flu shot adult life. I'm definitely going get one year. idea covid flu time flu recovering covid sounds horrible. Still alive, yes, young choose side way back 1918. Idk wasnt hospitalized mild pneumonia six weeks. March/April. Getting pulmonary function test week. Guess we'll see. Take pictures receipts along high priced items box, serial #, identifying numbers. Keep pictures cloud. Found shit hard way stuff stolen insurance needed much evidence possible get decent reimbursement. radical! get snowflake!

/s Reading hard people too, like this:

""the Republican president widely criticized handling pandemic. Republicans likely believe that, example, scientists media exaggerating seriousness virus. United States Democratic president criticized his/her handling pandemic, Democrats would believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories, said study‚Äôs author"" ""up to"" implies there's quite lot variability. doubt infected children viral loads high. Still, there's doubt children spread virus, even mortality risk much lower adults. fact ""people"" read one statistic let lead incorrect conclusions mean statistic misleading incorrect. COVID-19 actually LESS lethal flu 20 population. mean dangerous, less lethal flu overall (it **most definitely** less lethal flu overall). mean fully understand downstream consequences it. certainly mean kids ""immune"" send school packed indoor spaces consequence free. 

I serious problem people taking empirical data, low death rate among 20's pandemic, attempting manipulate personal ideological bent. Either try crowbar early opening schools youth recreational activity, ignoring fact teens make excellent transmission vectors...or try claim fact ""misleading"" trying scare idiots better public health compliance. That's breed conspiracy truthers anti-science zealots. 

Just honest facts. COVID-19 might kill young, could still get dreadfully ill face long term consequences, particularly overweight. could spread illness others vulnerable, perpetuate exponential growth pandemic, result current lockdowns mitigation efforts lasting even longer becoming even severe already are. That's plenty reason, itself, without lying teenagers telling death rates somehow ""tricking"" them. ""Fewer children die covid flu.""

Okay, go ahead tell us many preventable child covid deaths okay with. We're listening. already spying long that. now, matters 30% number come from? get it, nothing everything still went wrong sister teaches 4th grade I‚Äôm substitute (also long term librarian sub pandemic happened). I‚Äôm Southern CA. district supposed one best nationwide... 

The problem teach test taking students succeed. don‚Äôt well, lose money. lose money, can‚Äôt get needed supplies. field trips. visitors. WANT teach critical thinking. want teach students find information analyze validity. much time. it‚Äôs focused teaching test get funding try give opportunities. 

Most students main school poverty level immigrant parents. love damn much. sweet intelligent kills it‚Äôs wasted test taking. lose funding can‚Äôt field trips enrichments (the way they‚Äôll see places school). Without funding can‚Äôt afford new chromebooks (the technology they‚Äôll get don‚Äôt learn technology skills they‚Äôre ducked future - digital divide all). Without funding can‚Äôt get extra supplies... fairs... stuff like that. SUCKS. Sacre bleu! actually data that, saying make small proportion infected SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19. large survey US Centers Disease Control Prevention Atlanta, Georgia, found children aged 17 under, make 22% US population, account fewer 2% confirmed COVID-19 infections across United States. And, 2,572 children included survey, 5.7% went hospital three saying kids get severe complication may convenient way getting children care getting infected, seen nothing indicate that's actually case.

It's bad, mean 3 kids study still fucking died, obviously. unless already risk group extremely unlucky, nothing long term really going happen catch COVID-19 like 16. That's reality. Got ya. seems like lot people aren‚Äôt grasping actual death process. mean know first half statement blatant fucking lie, right? Please source assertion childhood mortality flu vs Covid. usual high Thursday keeps way could see first 300+ day week. ""Fewer children die covid flu.""

Okay, go ahead tell us many preventable child covid deaths okay with. We're listening. really freaking hard people sit still year? missed 3 trips pissed it, enough endanger others. hard people.

To Cain Gohmert boat guy. Literally stupid live. story tragic. farcical.

I'm supposed feel bad people? *Really?* offered positivity, typed novel bring narrative back negative. Plenty around. ‚Äúyea but‚Äù BSers. careful w life. Anyone worth damn sniff out. Well could afford rent $600 per week extra unemployment ended. That's literally entire point thread, can't afford since longer get that...not sure arguing about.

Also sure got $1200 stimulus month from. never $1200 month, one time $1200. extra unemployment actually $2400 month (since math hard that's 4 weeks times $600). Please try informed next time. surprising considering dentistry one unsanitary professions  work Sam's Club one supervisors floor backroom. Every day constant refrain ""do Clorox wipes? Lysol""? We're still getting even limited one unit per member sell pallet hour hits floor. someone stand almost handing one pack time people grab like 6 packs berate poor cashier register locks out. goes toilet paper paper towels still too.

I've got face masks hand sanitizer coming ears though. ""Fact 60% cases occurred last month concerning - points potentially exponential surge state,"" Dr. Hildreth wrote. ""We need redouble mitigation efforts.""

&amp;#x200B;

unfortunately 2x0=0 agree furthermore, we've seen actual recommendations Public Health Authority worked. implementation said recommendations supervision appliance inherited issues elderly care made casualties increase. none things actually control Public Health Authority, responsibility different parts government, authorities, regions municipalities. 

It extremely telling Socialstyrelsen got operations going government announced financing care staff unskilled temporary, municipalities private managers started providing elderly care staff proper PPE guidance, infection elderly homes dropped greatly. Last week heard bit briefings "" third week row, municipality reporting even lowest threshold (1%) infection elderly housings despite increased testing. ""

 None FHM's recommendations regard changed since March. I'm saying hope get's it, definitely deserves it. around 33,000.

For reference points hitting 70-80k tests pretty often. 

Positivity rate new tested stayed same. 

And state sites due hurricane. daily cases go back within week. comment mostly making point lot solutions keeping society strong functional government refuses use. 

The moratorium evictions actually weak solution. People pile huge rent debt, figure give assistance landlords well. would better though universal income people keep paying rent maybe --and novel approach-- figure work together something like we're clearly meant to. 

That last one never gonna happen. Weekend numbers usually bit like this, people take breaks weekends. Hurricane/tropical storm weekend tomorrow closed lot testing sites/labs reporting throughout East Coast people worried storm. least today Florida's deaths back reporting 240+, hopefully things back track properly reporting.

That said, theories manipulation data numbers states government adminstration handling data. great, another 5-10 years. transitions take time. ‚Äúhave tried bombing it?!‚Äù Essential business worker here. 

First day started taking temperatures, six people blocked entering due 100 degree higher fevers (the building decided preset number 100 degrees higher). last week woman 104 degree fever tried come denied. Ninety-three percent teachers make country's local average price goods services, according study, meaning even teachers best-paying countries still earn less average share national economy.

This doesn‚Äôt say seem think does. ended last week actually point, yeah...but there's still plenty jobs. One would almost say many jobs.

Think efficient average office-worker compared 50 years ago. We've got computers. We've got Excel. We've got applications 99% work used we're exponentially productive back then.

Yet GDP increase exponential rate.  productivity gone way, way, way up. GDP rising steady rate. true!  always put sign... lol. sit chair end driveway notify people. 1. said default ‚Äúacross country‚Äù, course areas hard hit won‚Äôt fit default pulling 1/3 ass 

2. Deaths lagging indicator tried nothing we're ideas ""the fact they're well-off families.""

This 100%. much easier get kids engaged work good wifi computer, parents afford work home/take time support them, even lack money-relaywd stressors. school district rural wifi throughout much state great. kids chaotic home situations cope online work. agree there's quick fix problem, states lots cases remote learning better alternative, think many people also downplay negative impact remote schooling many kids. Typical parent age ranges are:

25-34: 992 Deaths

35-44: 2,554 Deaths

45-54: 6,927 Deaths

From data set way quantify people fact parents, living child, pre-existing conditions. possible right quantify ""household"" child died COVID-19. start talking misinformation terms propaganda ask society media outlets allowed propagandize viewers?

In healthy, functioning society effective regulations reduce amount misinformation. children would taught ask questions like, ""Who benefits narrative? coded language used persuasively?""

And addressed issues literally previous presidency, might situation now. one waiting vaccine.

It could take long time get one; even able make one effective; sure thing all. Even phase II human trial results, though promising, inconclusive protect person infection. 

The EARLIST see phase III human trial result (which starting now) push production summer 2021, yes, earliest. first 100 million vaccines go front line medical works, first responders, high risk individuals; takes summer 2022; assuming US send vaccine make overseas. 

I know people crazy idea going get vaccine end year, simply going happen. mean, clearly clue, Dear Leader echo chamber full-MAGoid sycophants operate facts &amp; logic. wonder is...

Probably first part statement false, addition factors mentioned. YAH, CRAY CRAY TALK! part god's plan. point children‚Äôs susceptibility COVID-19 likely less flu

This first part statement. mention deadliness mortality. clearly wrong you‚Äôre trying shift goal posts already.

You're*. Nice projection! interesting... website indeed say that's case change product name clear.

Either way, I've able find Clorox Lysol wipes issues others commenting do. fine alternative - spraying bleach - actually effective less expensive. surface stay wet 4 minutes complete disinfecting, time liquid wipes evaporates well then, leading false sense security. Spray hefty amount bleach let sit 4 minutes wipe paper towels. going public places? answer yes, logic bs. bad they‚Äôll still dumb also dead. said every field though. really want sick, look administrative costs random charities. can't watch moment remember says end see couple years grandpa dad him. Kids dying virus incredibly rare, councilman doesn‚Äôt really much worry respect. Teachers hand... impossible assume slaughterhouses world probably proactive employers comes worker safety? mean yeah would kill orders magnitude people Covid. Also decisions stupid beholden market. listened intelligent economic advisors saying economic crisis public health crisis. It‚Äôs corrupt politicians extremely short sighted bad jobs. Since new evidence research points fact risk surface transmission incredibly low, probably matter clean all. understand beneficial reducing spread pathogens sanitizing ""deep cleaning"" BS mainly hygiene theater businesses capitalizing fear false sense security. investing improving ventilation systems. Ah yes, cause Australia daily cases spike daily death numbers makes bad America... Even states ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù virus compared states hitting first wave now, still safe good idea in-person instruction. 

Unless proper safety precautions met, similar would look hospital (NEWSFLASH! Schools don‚Äôt buildings/capacity/funding that), outbreaks inevitably occur school bleed every community cause states‚Äô numbers spike. sub: believe scientists experts, fall conspiracy theories unsourced info

Only time tell. wonder is...

Probably first part statement false, addition factors mentioned.

The ‚Äúfirst part statement‚Äù referred mortality flu vs. Covid children. Don‚Äôt worry admit wrong you‚Äôre trying shift goal posts already. Hm wow must work place

No bonus gang I‚Äôm sickly haha Know fucking hard keep Lysol demand office building? restricted access person operations fail (now I, since quit) get sick. still went twelve bottles six weeks. SEE IT? get look corruption?

Wound giving free trips away. I'm able hear anything. got imgurs ""removed"" text there. something wrong? claim? staff social distancing always wearing masks? social distancing masks effective? 

Not trying contentious, don‚Äôt understand side fence you‚Äôre on. hard people stop selfish, though. need get anxiety chest. Yesterday first customer ER nurse, asked bad hospital says beds. Covid patients hallways caring 10 people inside ER covid-19 ICU space available. says people dropping like flies soon ventilator becomes available someone else needs people pouring day night. last customer day young 20-something girl told got got call test came back positive. looked like someone flu weird face red, probably crying look like crying hot minute, fingers white toes strange color. closest I've someone indeed sick stay ten feet away easy tell well. lives small town population thousand, middle nowhere. reason woke today think two women lives must like today. starters, there's lot people affected fit narrative. everybody laid minimum wage employee. making considerably employment financial obligations reflect that- something easily afforded 100k year (car payments, private school tuition, furniture payments, etc.) drowning making unemployment. hardest hit people: laid fired, simply 1/5th income coming in- mechanics, plumbers, waitresses, ton blue collar jobs. course, let's forget people qualify unemployment income ""official"". Handymen, junk haulers, in-home daycare providers, like, many lost income completely near completely government may even considered working, get nothing now. aside job loss, let's look thousands parents providing everything kids 18 jobless, completely ignored stimulus child bonus, even thousands people used free childcare via schools, find hundreds thousands budget child care work. way one time stimulus payment unemployment ""more enough"" began ordeal crappy, official minimum wage job like fast food worker retail sales associate, kids. sent kids back school China one getting infected there! totally send kids back! /s 
The reason people can‚Äôt wait send kids back can‚Äôt stand home take responsibility actually sit part schooling instead dumping someone else 8 hours day. leopards hungry am. really, US economy taken beating rising infections Sweden's falling. incredibly ignorant massive negative swings world economy people. People die. 

It's okay understand something, okay preach like know way fucking clue talking about. Wish took serious you. willingly opened state early people die, trying force schools open people die, deserves anything comes him. Civilization meant protect rights, provide living free charge. Masks public like condom hookup. parties involved want used, despite health interpersonal trust. want see data this. hope publish soon, especially already approved emergency use.

A peptide relatively safe, still needs prove efficiency. Oh, remember shit. Truthfully, teaching anything. boring death. truth, nickname sense Russian :D forcing? kids ecstatic get back school. need 'force' stay home. Hope alright! Also Austin, looks like new thing rapid test asymptomatic folks. don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs hard rule it‚Äôs definitely marketed way ‚Äúswing see!‚Äù contact tracer, first thing wanted contact tracer simply could get difficult person phone unload anger frustration them.

This sayin sry I've also years. would grant areas like Wharf, City Center, parts Navy Yard devoid culture influx luxury apartments, act like DC rich culture generations citizens lived totally accurate -- people forced EOTR luxury apartments.

DC definitely transient element, especially among upper-middle class, mostly white citizens. sorry hate much here. Hopefully, find opportunity move someplace happier. lots hand sanitizer/disinfectant sprays tables stuff classes

Shared surfaces probably issue. Make sure every classroom well-ventilated. could even put standalone HEPA filters room. start elementary schools. risks smallest benefits in-person education biggest.  camps households, no, like that.


If think parents separate kids, don‚Äôt know parenting Never mind shopping. hell anybody standing walking 104? Turns unrealistic part arrested instead given round applause nice fat bonus.   news today - see high murder rates chaos man showing unforgiving is. Leave first sorry off, deserve it! :) wipe containers. transfer food plate home, microwave little kill anything concerned still lingering.

Of course, people need whatever makes comfortable, I'm high-risk (immunocompromised) getting take-out delivery almost entire time. NYC. understand everyone different level risk tolerance. wanted share strategies I've share concerns items handled reach me. Yeah, clearly middle ground...like every first world nation. teach kids read particular questions know answer. it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs time focus much test results (we to) can‚Äôt take time things. two options? Funny nothing, tens thousands people die. Yup. 1st states outbreaks highest death rates reason- knew even less treatment back March. odds surviving covid already improved. 3 months likely even better. so, quick effective treatments may also cut rate longterm effects covid patients experiencing. include endorsements, merchandise, commercial deals? That's words work American English least. Knowing someone knows someone knowing someone yourself. social network people interact with, people interact with. culture safety-ism. demand everything perfectly safe, else illegal.

There safe choice. Opening schools poses risks, opening also poses risks. People like nuance simply declare one set risks unimportant easy decision make. looks like average population public schools United States [roughly 600 even one students carrier virus, entire school population risk contracting Covid-19 disease.

I know well versed viral transmission, 600 students likely come contact several family members people. That's huge vector transmission risk life long term health consequences actually bad family relationships put burden them. 

It unquestionably burden family. think valid say ""actually bad family relationships"" though. Perhaps could cite sources support claim. Anecdotal evidence carry much weight. devastating? would good happened often, hit hardest virus put misery it. worry finding new job.

Edit: suppose may devasting surviving loved ones. real key educating children isn‚Äôt ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù thing. know I‚Äôve homeschooling 3 kids last 8 years so. biggest key finding program fits one get education. None children would done well normal school setting. 

My oldest good private school kindergarten 1st grade, couldn‚Äôt read end first grade. easily distracted sucked every little bit little kid drama - wore nicer dress, etc. low 40th percentile end First grade. Removing drama allowed focus, end second grade read Hobbit cover cover scored 96-98th percentile every subject. last 8 years, tweaked education ensure keeps moving forward learns way fits. 

My middle child severe dyslexia. He‚Äôs extremely smart, detail-oriented, creative, 10 years old still struggles reading. 3D model Fusion 360 create 3D printed toys moving parts, reading hard him. took us almost 2 years find good program learning read dyslexia, much better now, reading constantly improving. 

My youngest severe ADHD can‚Äôt sit still focus single task minute two - unless find ways channel attention. also sponge. standing head computer chair playing stuffed animal, absorb every word video playing computer. retains information recall apply months later. amazing inferential reasoning skills 8 year old. hyperactive struggles things like ‚Äústanding line‚Äù ‚Äúsitting quietly‚Äù. long run, probably need medicated ADHD doesn‚Äôt stunt potential, right working hard avoid fun silly personality (as well doctor) concerns medication take away. 

All 3 kids use online learning programs, fit child rather expecting child fit specific program. Look tp lol. Toilet paper paper towels sold everywhere look near (atlanta) since march. I‚Äôve using hand guess works out. think overating impact 6 months education kid. They'll fine. life go on. work hard while, they'll caught up. still (at rate) go college get careers. probably even remember 6 months taking break education they're loved ones die. remember almost nothing happened like 7th grade even hated school spent time playing computer games reading fiction learning. I've got college degree working towards good career path. even taken world view, plague biblical? corrupt ruler/false idol whose followers wear mark heads telling people ignore death creeping closer them, death brought greed malice. folks think Lady Gaga channeling Satan they‚Äôre chill that? part princess? alcohol carcinogen? sports players care fans?

Is alcohol carcinogen: bread circus: clear, COVID-19 different virus. COVID-19 means one lucky folks symptoms. COVID-19 literally means disease means symptoms means damage done body. Degrees damage obviously matter, right know extent damage. going years study recovered COVID-19 folks study good bad body fared time. maybe bad folks sub fear, also can't say problems either. Uncritically accepting word Chinese officials trump, nice It'll probably couple months. They'll fine. mean?Schools wanting general population stupid generations,this something new that's school generally suck place always bad, whole thing bullshit imo.  Wear mask, sit down, take eat restaurant put back on?
   eyes absorb virus easy respiratory tract. infant coughed store?, guess what, smoked reguardless mask. 
   virus bad say. would pushing bodies bulldozer burn pile every metropolitan city US. 
   cloth mask shit. think every employee use respirator, get fit test, aka shaven face done hospital. 
   feel better wearing mask go support 1000%. try chastise excersing right draw conclusions acting them. clue talking COVID less lethal flu minors T-Cell response age dependent majority damage caused COVID-19 consequence adaptive immune system coming overwhelming, inflammatory ""second wave"" innate fails.

I suspect COVID stops novel become something afterthought, bang, whimper. getting presents something serious problem.

I worry ""COVID worse flu"" messaging, COVID dramatically dangerous current seasonal flu variants, widely innoculated, virulent, novel pandemic flu would bring global community knees, make current pandemic look quaint comparison. educated think critically, able so. question isn‚Äôt whether ‚Äúeducation‚Äù makes difference, question is, teaching critical thinking? would add people need taught flexible thinking well. Even people taught critical thinking fall ‚Äúabsolutist‚Äù thinking patterns. making distinction critical thinking method thinking base views factual scientific evidence. Sometimes, individual‚Äôs personal experience go currently held yet evidence based societal idea. Also, areas there‚Äôs simply lack evidence. times flexible thinking important. old fashioned way

Which probably environmentally friendly way. voting him, also voting idiotic, cultish enablers. agree, high school buildings closed remote learning, elementary schools could potentially use space classrooms socially distance students. elementary schools around 600 students, high schools anywhere 1000 - 3000, would give lot space spread students out. second point though disagree, think rise mental health problems clearly linked social economic pressures lockdown. terrible time lot people especially already vulnerable.

Please explain thoughts feelings empower make blanket statements source problems instead looking facts actual research?

You bit habit this. this. mean, go ahead thoughts, bring ideas discussion...but stop talking know things fact simply countering actual facts based _thoughts feelings_. load crap, built 1 liberty ship per day ww2 cant get little paper wipes covered bleach till next year. joke. tuberculosis vaccine

Wow! seen murse fruemd ages since I'm pregnant asssumed oozing germs every poreüòÖ Aldi refunds questions asked package Disney specific versions cookies, ice cream, churros, gumbo, etc. 8 hours? like 12 14 hours. YEah, tourists get infected bring back home contries.... Mods, way add US content filter sub? 

It‚Äôs hard find stories/posts related Africa, Asia, Europe, etc. current volume US posts. I‚Äôm thinking r/worldnews filters certain issues may take front page one time. Check yahoo's post history. feed troll. He's sub stir shit. forget GoFundMe plea end video. ‚ÄòMerica! Fck yeah! Yes, obviously teachers use ppe distancing (and good ventilation/outdoors) protect themselves. 

You probably get pushback say ""kids unlikely die"" ignore mother 60s school librarian (and sisters high school teachers). mom relatively high risk die would safer home. That's really long term solution, though, mean school person. also nieces understand benefit greatly going back school. want there. fact relatively safe missing important part picture. 

My point simply statement incomplete, us love someone works school, insulting dismissive repeated constantly end discussion. whoever leaves 7 year old care Florida Man drinks midnight, really ought reconsider. Great news. Masks closing bars made difference.  find analogy bit putting... HCQ FDA approved 65 years, nobody prescribing patients Bleach. asked many kids. said ok .05 percent.  math. 56 million kids go school .05 percent die that's 28000. want keep playing games trying make look less grim, fine. I'm one advocating sending kids graves. think .05 IFR among children lead insane amount deaths families one using brain. Well maybe those. systems would able take strain already pretty broken defunded begin with. savings, decent healthcare, work businesses respect healthcare need stay home, systems set WFH, family smaller community set ups watch children (and interact anyone else), k-12 public school systems set online classes worksheets available online ability communicate teachers online, every school summer programs feeding kids one meal day let alone three. countless smaller bigger issues. lot places stepped up, individual volunteer type basis restricts ability effective. 

I mean humility foresight begin maybe wouldnt weak social programs, think three, would still huge struggle. agree truly feel parents whose backs wall choice send children back school work schedules. referring parents. saying cannot understand parents read news see happening schools across country students teachers getting hit covid thinking still safe send children school. really sucks right because, parent, kind feel like lose-lose situation choose child's physical health keeping home mental health sending back normal school routine. end feel even one child's life, family member teacher's life, spared dying covid, worth go virtual route things settle down. ""less dumb"" answers are: ""When vaccine comes market"" ""Maybe July next year biden gets elected.""

Neither good small talk. Thanks reply. totally agree matter free speech, far know large western democracies, be. referring general use 'freedom' argument oppose whatever people like. Wearing masks, sugar tax, smoking areas, met cries freedom taken away. people think important protect companies protect actual people. 

I'm happy hear nazi ideology still generally condemned US. Funny mention knives swastikas them. brother bought something store India, put plastic bag decorated row swastikas. discovered swastika old religious symbol Hinduism. Apparently, found temples well. really. Even little air movement, circulated large contact tracing shown large % transmissions occurred outdoor gatherings lately

Source please I've seen single one supported that. Lots mentions ""could"" maybe"" nothing points that. Also ones involve lots indoor time, 4th July beaches bars, restaurants, cafes etc. open serving people. Phase 1...

Where's Moderna news? No, stop ignoring point made. clearly understand can‚Äôt come counteragument. repeating exactly happened Spanish flu around. flu hits turns epidemic turns pandemic countries go lockdown time death rates drop governments open early death rates climb first wave. governments put everyone back lockdown extend make sure it‚Äôs wiped out. Honestly history lesson learned called leaders obviously don‚Äôt care people would keep lockdown things gone. Almost every night me. I'm really, really starting loathe anti-mask morons. US already manufacturing vaccines.  Wow, culture makes fun people reading? foreign born wife lived West Coast (Portland/LA) understand anti-maskers racists. ""I know any."" need take long vacation deep south educate her. called understanding reality. know gettig F'd virus hit much harder white americans like me.

I remember Fed chief talking 40% making 40K losing thier jobs... Covid screwing Latinx hard. ex GF first got ""furloughed"", unlike people situation able talk process eventually got signed pandemic unemployment (it gig job normally eligible UI.) three week delay late rent, finally started getting checks. work called back; limited hours, enough cover bill enough qualify PUAI. go risk health regular basis pitance.

Latinx people often either stuck risking lives chump change ""essential workers"" unemployed rate significantly higher national average. surprising bleaker view. That's even beginning touch higher infection mortality rates.

As father always told growing up, ""The worlds fair"". Latinx people bleaker view, (in general) live world bleaker outcomes Covid.  said, US largest foreign aid contributor worldwide, significant margin.

In raw numbers. percentage total wealth, contributions tiny. fact ship large number prisoners Vermont radio discussed state government least last five years. Vermonters keep baulking cost building new prison, (or replacing mental hospital destroyed Irene) objecting obvious problems authorizing private one in-state. 

The three prisons in-state dilapidated. 

I know poor rural state, situation needs fixed.

Gov Scott (Vermont) talked today Tuesday/Friday Covid press conference. Covid rate near Mississippi prison 6x high Chittenden, highest rate county. Even finding ways reduce prison population, need new prison in-state. Lol. Getting car crash doesn‚Äôt cause people get car crash well. It‚Äôs contagious. That‚Äôs idiotic comparison. Also every single person could get accident day. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs called accident. Covid 19 100% avoidable exposing teachers dozens kids everyday. americans didn‚Äôt vote society accomodate all? ~95% pull through? talking airborne rabies. Haha yeah AmErIcA bAd updoots left xD isn‚Äôt total voter turnout like 40% ? amazing low needs set bar *chance* US meet anything remotely close acceptable epidemiological target right now. People Florida fucking dumb.

You cant expect humans social distance rest lives. 

You cant punish people *people*   everyone drives drunk kills someone, therefore okay people every child rides bike without bike helmet gets brain damage, therefore wear every line cook refuses wash hands taking shit gives customer diphtheria, washing hands using bathroom stupid.

We're ""accounting possibilities"", we're assessing risks vs rewards. ""Everyone okay"" risk. also reward record, baseline. ""reward"" case prettier pictures ""risk"" causing death.

If potential deaths worth better wedding photos... get head checked. decent testing strategy?

I think schools open lot surveillance testing, I'm sure that. Blanket statements educated tbh. use work old Eskimo grew village far north Canada. says elders would patrol polar bears kids won‚Äôt become snack school. ..offer give everybody hundred grand don‚Äôt catch Covid two-years.. ""best offer half empty bottle hydroxychlorosomething bleach enema (refurbished)"" think explained logic different angles.
Don't worry, people look 'essential employees' forced go survive planned slaughter. agree absolutely insane. Yes, soon child exits womb, shall protected inflatable plastic bubble die old age. way one dead child‚Ñ¢ many!  Well put way. Open schools lmao. Dumb students growing dumb adults today. 

Obviously i‚Äôm serious.... lowkey, I‚Äôm also kidding smh.  OK, sure talking recent dip. 

The antibody tests removed, believe addition first place oversight part scheme cook books. 

I absolutely agree last part post, frankly think Texas leadership smart enough pull something like suggesting. !remindme one month many lions sick easier ways tell us know strawman actually is, /u/fallicies. wrong though.

Most vaccines die phase 3. Even safe could provide way less protection needed.

There's good chance ready mass consumption year.

Don't bet it. Oh, mean Shoe itself... Yeah, right on. 103.9 felt like brain stewing skull. weird feverish dreams spent lot time slumped face butt air reason. Couldn‚Äôt think straight went hospital. Took shit ton fluids told probably sort stomach bug let go. It‚Äôs sucked. thank yet. Listen new York times daily special covid last week, go detail regulations hamstrung everyone. go detail profit hospitals little patients poorer non profit hospitals inundated.

If massive coordination across states country regards health infrastructure seen sorts numbers jump. capitalist society twisted way stimy even basic obvious ways help. anyone know buy online? I‚Äôve looking 5 months last can. nothing, probably. flu vaccine too. Let's forget states well. major fuck general every day workers  *Insert ""I told so"" meme here* Also safer avoid positions facing other. pulling bullshit straight ass understanding positivity rates work, infectious disease is, current levels infection US.

The best birthday present ever, shared mother law, friend works employment services office. there, got good lucky get them. I've worse.  thought read already happened. Indiana. Oh fuck. course agree, take post mean? sure hope [anywhere near know Nevada quakes too, time, Nevada abundance earthquakes considered **the third actively seismic state**. largest earthquake state history magnitude 7.3 1915 next biggest 7.1 1932. 1954 alone, state saw five earthquakes magnitude 6.5 greater. government response also sucks ass, almost level US.

Goes show much impact culture has. money. Lots money. People months ago would go nuts vengeance dared say children nuclear family (apparently would prefer couples stay abusers consider brainstorming alternatives). people like ""childcare work important losing parents kids there."" Ron Desantis says hi üëãüèæ Yes flew separate god damn planes! oh how? sadly is. :( asking, ""in opinion"" thought tests counted. asking ""their opinion""

Telling me, asked ""their opinion"", ""their opinion"" weird thing say. spits fucking kid? know, Florida man, does. god, far fallen? outrageous, even Florida. not. know several families travelled midwest. overweight, including people 70 party. buy set dice caltrop. Real low-budget caltrops getting $10 box Lego. restaurants, bars, cafes etc. open 4th July? trip beach?

And huffpost, well huff. That's reliable NYpost. even article says less transmitted outside. focuses virus largely airborne case. study 318 outbreaks China, transmission cases except one occurred indoor spaces

The risk significantly lower. That's good problem business Anti-intellectualism, racism, conspiracy theories, eroding trust public institutions, etc price tag must eventually paid. people using tactics count reaping benefits bill come someone else later on. downright evil.

Well, bills coming due past years, see destructive consequences. want get sick, immunity builds vaccine. It'll short term end sight, miraculously immune right shot. immune system needs time.

That's say need start educating people potential vaccines now. can't surprise people getting sick right getting vaccine. Furthermore, enough people get vaccine stop uncontrolled spread, weakened immune systems might handle vaccine well choice isolate risk getting sick.

Sorry like facts, that's truth. People listen get sick. there's expiration date! people wait long, they'll grow ugly want marry anymore! But, closed testing sites, numbers going down! Indiana, literally stupid live. What? hear? ""Biden/Obama disaster handling H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily incompetence! ! 17k, point still stands. One starve.

The irresponsible cretins care fellow humans.

Yeah, definitely feel sorry former latter Many states reporting recoveries correctly either. (As lot recoveries reported) I'm sorry hear that. know experience important routine kids completely messed everything up. Happy cake day fair kid pretty overweight would probably take billion people hundreds corporations make dent.

But runaway change rate anyway would make less people fighting scraps.

Humanity toast. really weird, stock market evolved, huge amount retail investors, day traders mostly.

Rather stock prices based what's actually produced resources has, based feel worth vs everyone else does.

Currently seeing lot trading based idea flipping stock higher price quickly instead holding long term. creating quickly expanding bubble. type short term thinking seeing behind reopening economy/schools.

A quick stock market example cruise line stock prices. Carnival double low last 12 month, recent reopening cruises turned covid hotspots. continue operate income months. I'll keep mind new boat slip Nevada.   Okay. sympathize teachers really nervous BioWar zone soon. teacher said reason she‚Äôs nervous asthma. reason worry death? I‚Äôm genuinely asking wondering I‚Äôm missing something. 


I hope everybody finds ways stay safe tough times god get ahold think Ben Carson would quite well get VID. upset find wrong.. TRY BEST SUCCEEEEEEED would New York Florida handled point? Makes sense, totally different circumstances. oh. logic fucked. goodluck sorting out.  Know else expensive? Medical care something like Covid, that‚Äôs what. Medical expenses play role significant fraction bankruptcies US. Way make fun someone suffering mental illness. Real cool  live west coast. People retire go there. It‚Äôs bad around. Hope gets better everyone soon. Haha fucked.   Seriously? teachers better wife goes hospital work every day? better brother-in-law continues bag people's groceries? better dental hygienist cleans teeth couple days ago shit spraying everywhere leaning 6 inches open mouth 2 hours??

checkmate dumbass /s probably fully aware this, case, since really helps friend mine tinnitus:

""Place palms hands ears fingers resting gently back head. middle fingers point toward one another base skull. Place index fingers top middle fingers snap (the index fingers) onto skull making loud, drumming noise. Repeat 40-50 times. people experience immediate relief method. Repeat several times day long necessary reduce tinnitus.‚Äù make 15 weeks Yep. That's focus building herd immunity now. NVX‚ÄëCoV2373 created using Novavax‚Äô recombinant nanoparticle technology generate antigen derived coronavirus spike (S) protein contains Novavax‚Äô patented saponin-based Matrix-M‚Ñ¢ adjuvant enhance immune response stimulate high levels neutralizing antibodies.

So sounds like vaccine based synthetic manufacturing spike protein affixing sort nanoparticle reason? Good. Fk him. there's lots data long term damage ‚ÄúIt open bar, restrictions,‚Äù said one Nashville resident tells News 2 attended party hoping make connections art business. ‚ÄúEvery room went home people front back partying, saw maybe handful people masks on.‚Äù

Absolutely ridiculous. loud alcohol makes everyone talk, practically guaranteed super spreading event. anti-intellectualism reason Southern California LA region massive spike time Texas Florida? anybody this? Today there's pictures floating around packed Georgia Hallways 95% students wearing masks even run shoulders.

This going actual disaster uniform distribution like sound light. bundles particles riding waves heat air currents. come dont widespread test gives results within day yet?

All talk pouring billions premanufacturing potential vaccine talk actual testing/tracing program schools would pressure? would understand companies, schools mostly managed government, it?  live? everybody building wears mask UCF Orlando. mean due respect seriously doubt vaccine come we're going nothing it. mean urgency really trust current administration feel like expecting semblance plan get back degree normalcy/having economy moving something they'd actually  5 million documented... probably closer 20m+ picked arbitrary round number air. feel like south done nothing bring rest nation down. Basically anchor that's held us back. fairness Gov Reeves, he's record recommending masks.

Perhaps knows residents state.

He previously record suggesting state-level mandate might actually cause \_less\_ mask wearing large number residents like told do. Let‚Äôs honest, going school Louisiana, they‚Äôd end dead uneducated. big takeaway children learn example needs taught things change tradition health always gonna #1 economy important one person. one person dies, country even notice, economy dies, we'll feel it, ton people die chaos.

Is important 10? 100? 1000? know draw line. draw it. right....they dire state. think implications.

In counties/district/state, containment/avoidance measures much less rigorous. places, teachers likely exposed often &amp; likely forced quarantine wait negative test result. teach students educators stay home? come substitute teacher forced quarantine job. Even did, substitute teachers teach.

I think bodies piling up, resources wasted. There's point opening school they're babysitting kids. husband wrote wills son born, checked last week copies house everything date. also started compiling list things case die. ""Educated"" think meant state decide reduce bill 20,000? "" ""**If goggles** eye shield, **you** **use it**,‚Äù director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases said. **Fauci** noted **goggles** would provide ‚Äúperfect protection mucosal surfaces.""

 Gen Z getting payback boomers Reddit‚Äôs young, college grad, WFH user base blames everything poor people. They‚Äôre new scapegoat. Mention can‚Äôt WFH thus kid needs school? Dumb broke idiot redneck. Should‚Äôve planned 5 month economy shutdown getting software job home, instead factory/truck driving/lab tech/grocery store job. don‚Äôt even think speaking up, get mocked shamed anti-intellectual. It‚Äôs really sad.

edit: anyone looking, Coronavirus mortality rates state today: anyone still looking, Coronavirus mortality rates state, nursing home residents specifically. Incredibly sad.  Married buried. I'm thinking maybe keeping home first two four weeks, assess regional numbers affected. I'm position luckily that, like - work home need regularly *work*. science support would fine it. pulled 6ft ass, running it. meantime I'll wait real science tell 3 sigma safe distance is. It‚Äôs extremely easy get AIDS. Like ridiculously easy. far qualified teach son. know teach calculus. time figure that. special educational needs well. teachers work according IEP master's degrees. supposed try pretend level knowledge short time? also supposed give career spent two decades building? dentist clean teeth, wife go hospital every fucking day, grocery store workers work throughout entire pandemic, teachers go back fucking work district provides devices students home internet needed even virtual option. made sure cover that. 6 school home, one device, pick Chromebooks next week, like used crisis education March. suppose might parents consent school device home (We nutballs sticks too.) Death concern influenza. do, want stay locked next 5 years. try mitigate risks best ways cost us terribly (masks, testing, etc)

We do? GREAT news. start that? makes sense. large enough sample feb/mar gotten thought maybe there‚Äôs studies done could say you‚Äôre good least 5 months something along lines. guess I'm loop. I'm covid stopped lock downs etc. society terrible before. wrong concerts hugging friends. want understand I'm trying jerk. everything person touching wrong rest time? see article like least day. Yes. But, well know, doesn‚Äôt tell us anything infection rates January February. 

They weren‚Äôt 11 million pooled antibody tests. We'll see really. [Oahu, one islands Hawaii, implemented month August probably get recent spike down. People Canada might want come can't get control. Well then, share originally posted. sister teacher (Louisiana) principals area telling teachers spend first weeks teaching kids access use online learning system set place (not if) forced shut down. Maybe essentially press release manufacturer - hardly unbiased source. want see double blind placebo study results. reaction high fever makes sense. honest, crisis way COVID. chose already selfish little spent education, social supports, etc. sudden awakening folks paying attention. don‚Äôt know parents motives I‚Äôm Highschool student would much like go back. Distance learning work all, idk I‚Äôm really able actually learn retain information distance learning, yes would also like see friends actual education big motive want go back. would legitimately break someone felt way. fucking joke. lives long enough children. pray tell?  Okay, I'll play game.

US 5 million tested confirmed cases 300 million people. Let's assume numbers factual, random sampling 200 people 300 people wedding. ignoring fact New York higher percentage cases.

Chances 1 person infected 295/300 = 98.33% (most probably healthy).

Chances 200 people simultaneously healthy 98.33% times 98.33% times 98.33% times 98.33% .... 200 times.

Mathematically shown 0.9833^200 , read 0.9833 power 200.

Which equals chance everyone healthy.

**96.6% chance least one person COVID-19.**

Prove math wrong embarrass further. HA great reference agree. Major League Baseball season already rails due rampant Covid infections players coaches. MLB cannot figure out, anyone think done local level?

The NBA NHL managed successfully program implemented strict social bubbles implemented frequent testing regimes. local schools sports clubs resources capabilities this.

This good year keep kids home high-risk activities sports. Even though mortality rates kids much lower average, growing body evidence covid cause heart brain damage. Playing sports worth risking lives health students, teachers, parents. Preach yung genobili. Knew u u dawg pay guaranteed straight state?

mmmkay that's little bit trickier Low-thinkers: upset lost custody child... system unfair!

Everyone else: know, maybe lost custody child he's type person would shoot people asking nicely put mask... later try kill cops. silly non-science based statement. Thank you, exactly thinking. Every time makes case drying respond, ‚Äúwell hope it‚Äôs mom kids, mine parents.‚Äù agrees. He‚Äôs entirely respectful mask rules isn‚Äôt arguing them, thinks they‚Äôre stupid. 

I‚Äôd lying said views didn‚Äôt make question relationship there‚Äôs definitely tinge anti-science that‚Äôs roll all. Nice try LeBron, wife bubble Decimated; one ten. devastated can't say; that's point carry ""real"" meaning. fit sensationalism accurate description IMO.  WH *did take case reporting CDC.* took hospitalization data aggregation, even states still report data. Please tell truth. Arrested? That's it? also need fined heavily, imprisoned anyone died consequence actions, denied treatment covid contact it. Fuck Hippocratic oath instances.

If willing take deliberate steps circumvent law restrictions organising party without regard may killing direct consequence actions piece shit. nobody commenting ‚Äúmother ten‚Äù. Like holy fuck, that‚Äôs lot! Really that‚Äôs response?! fucking wear mask retort completely idiotic. don‚Äôt give shit anyone unless it‚Äôs covid 19. got shot several times survived Homeless people can't vote. right schedule. get information? mfgs received funding, committed hundreds millions doses end 2020. Wearing mask decrease viral load. droplets might make perfect seal, ones going breathe mouth end surface mask.

Obviously, masks also greatly decreases distance viruses go speak cough breathe sick. Yes wtf also pier 1 shopping her. lady 10 kids none told stay home order online?! lifetime opportunity. got die covid really think people deliberately refuse wear mask political reasons locked manslaughter. still maybe death. Yeah it‚Äôs still worth wearing even others aren‚Äôt, works *way* better people wearing mask. STFU put mask on. imagine dying slowly painfully alone. politicians limited power. 

The thing might save authoritative government. China almost locked down, soon things open again, spreads.

Fuck reddit huge echo chamber. counts ""dead covid-19, "". implies actual death toll less official one

And doctor mentions - different ways counting deaths FHM's one ""with covid-19"". one based death certificates still finds 90% people died due COVID-19 FHM's official reports. got mine yesterday CVS American culture built intersection individualism exceptionalism, hard many extend compassion beyond people immediately know, they're even generous.

Wow, 80 year old man died respiratory disease? Holy shit different ways countries reporting deaths (most notable Russia's statements back May think) actually published guideline COVID-19 reported primary cause death present primary cause death. 

In Sweden, death certificate reports (which eventually become actual death records) ones analyzed published Board Health Welfare. count people attending doctor diagnosed patient COVID-19 (regardless tested not) patient died either direct result secondary effect, believe. also publish proportion cases already included Public Health Authority's reported deaths (which people died COVID-19 last 30 days). around 90%; means 90% deaths assigned COVID-19 related deaths attending doctors death certificates already official statistics, 10% missed one reason another. 

If paid attention numbers gave might notice, however Public Health Authority's death numbers higher ones Board Health Safety. 10% deaths missed, others included instead people die causes. However numbers rather close means even small differences, picture consistent. 

The excess mortality estimations also line these. bit lower reported deaths far, article mentions, delays records too. you‚Äôre teenager like 1/2000 chance death keep hearing unsafe Disney right now, they've open month heard outbreaks originating parks.

And there's lot reasons countries adopting this. First, countries realize benefit well educated citizenship cost barrier keeps people uninformed. Second, countries better job paying labor US. full time academic course load full time job people idiots realize pay people full time work. Third, countries realize pay good students, become better students. US forces lot really important professions work additional jobs make ends meet means surgeons spend less time studying human body countries decided maybe doctors focus studies waitressing Like come on, sound like idiot.

**Aug. 2 = 10,599 tests conducted. [1,324 positive results] = 12.4% Sunday.**    
(Please remember SUNDAY ALWAYS highest percent normal testing facilities open, severe even tested)(not good system)   
**Aug. 3 = 25,794 tests conducted. [937 tested positive] = 3.6% Monday.**    
[Data provided Ministry Health, Labor Welfare.]   
   
    
NHK always reports higher numbers (which trust), 1. NHK numbers always 3 days later Ministry Health, 2. Proportionally Ministry Healthy NHK *percentage/proportions*, numbers differ final % always close other.    
For example, NHK reporting 961 new cases Aug. 3 (MHLW = 937), NHK reported total number tested, usually 1,000 initial MHLW, probably approximately 27,800 finally print chart (which takes 3-5 days) 3.6%. usually trust NHK numbers released later (when results collected sources).   
Today NHK reports Aug. 3 deaths Covid = 1   
Today MHLW reports Aug. 3 deaths Covid = 4

CDC guidelines say open 14 days 5% less means long way go we‚Äôre opening anyway. already outbreaks classrooms summer programs we‚Äôve already children die. Even though personally think it‚Äôs safer stay home, believe giving people options. way it‚Äôs set up, people options students. Teachers expected campus take unpaid leave absence. online option setting webcam classroom students tune home. doesn‚Äôt offer teachers option teach remotely also essentially doubles already large work load. (For context, worked 14 hour days still work nights weekends this. can‚Äôt imagine juggling even possibility.) told students remote options live classroom streaming count towards FTE hours/attendance funding. schools going taking serious budget cuts there. Also, may true teachers needing jobs north, south serious teacher sub shortage. pull district workers fill classroom teaching positions teacher sick would split class grade level classrooms. that‚Äôs covid nonsense. Class sizes going increase due shortage, rarely subs is, teachers going take weeks sick time (mandatory exposed showing symptoms get negative covid test) they‚Äôre going end split classes, increasing class sizes basically eliminating social distancing. positions power solution oriented instead claiming teachers lazy (which farthest truth) would absolutely 50/50 hybrid options risk teachers get priority remote teaching jobs none schools lost funding.

It's matter when. Herd immunity kicks 60 - 70 %There studies show antibodies may last short 40%They still understand virus human body.  studies say 2/3rds victims ;lasting permanent effects.

So me, I'm trying delay long possible.  time goes better treated less likely die serious side effects.

Lets math 330 Million people.  60% herd immunity 1 3 serious effects.  those, death rate 5.6%.

330,000,000 x .6 x.33 x 5.6% = 3.65 Million people die.

330,000,000 x.6 x.33        = 65 Million people seriously affected. So..... one actually held accountable, like times stuff happened. Even did, Trump give pardon. They'll probably fine 100k move on.

Not sure trying insinuate, friends China lockdown never problem getting fresh groceries. I've never understood disdain many teachers country.

Instead giving teachers benefit doubt &amp; assume that, like Americans, teachers concerned safety would rather safe sorry working home, many think teachers want collect free money, even expense students.

\~15-25% teachers taught K-12 least middle-aged (grey-haired). older likely COVID-19 put back; 60 they're serious risk (2-3%) dying.

Given teachers stuck closed space hours 15-30 people, maintain connection students online--it makes sense they'd wait see get cases northeastern state levels &amp; maintain late Sept early Oct.....or least phase classes slowly.

Those criticizing teachers would better argument way connect teachers students students would irreparably damaged.

So even made statistic true, relevant shows parroting something heard without even thinking applies here, true anti-intellectual fashion. neaderthalism.

That data ""someone corona January-April, still damage 3-5 month later"" pretty easy have. person need corona test back got sick, medical evaluations now.

This perfect example. saw article, maybe Reddit, two hairdressers, positive COVID 19, like 129 people didn‚Äôt infect one wore masks, disinfected everything else. testing standard across states. not? like test reversed, infected people likely test negative uninfected people vice versa. catch every infection, still better catching like 10% fever screening Geez, jerk.

You cant argue people wearing masks protests riots anymore youre nitpicking trying divert subject.

Ive shown evidence people wearing masks. need evidence riots google targets federal court houses burned repercussions. 

My job isnt educate grocery bagger like reddit. No, point prevalence numbers metric using inform decisions. Risk-based decision-making, accurately described frequency occurrence -- often likely draw red marble jar; likely drug work illness, likely die plane crash -- maybe inform decisions (at least part). emergent phenomenon prevalence thoroughly evenly distributed, particularly case pandemic like one, can't rely frequency guide you. always clicks curve; week front behind different population another part country.

Instead, priority placed ensuring adequate safeguards place secure low frequency, includes particular, testing regularly tracing throughout community.

The schools open prevalence low, prevalence low enough viable test trace regime, accompanied appropriate sets pandemic hygiene practices, keep low. happens NOWHERE country viable, actionable test trace regime. single state, possible exception Vermont, rapid turnaround testing, low enough prevalence, makes feasible successfully contact trace Rolly polly, polly,

My bet crisis doomed attempt defend Taiwan I'd bet otherwise.  true low death rate? US strong education system; equitable.

Because schools funded US, means de facto segregation high income families low income families directly affects quality education student cohort receives.

If look US achievement whole, bad compared country like Denmark Finland, example education Scandinavia much equitable US system incredibly inequitable. compared results high income districts, think see results significant number employees tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon educated schools places like China, India, Eastern Europe

Some minorities over-represented, definitely ""a significant number"". also take issue assumption Asians over-represented -- example, must immigrants. Note companies situated parts country higher concentration Asians first place like SF, NYC, Boston. ""Asian-American"" ""Indian-American"" still American.

I‚Äôm ok.

Pretty sure five got Rona somewhere else, there‚Äôs way know sure contact tracing ain‚Äôt working hot.

And seen yet another medical grade mask, please join mask up, Donny isn‚Äôt generous remdesivir... April far highest amount excess deaths, making worst month. Cases higher April due testing (5 times many tests average pandemic's peak), average deaths still 1000 lower mid-April. second wave COVID-19 huge fuckup US, calling July 'worst month' simply misleading. Wow! didn‚Äôt think Pier 1‚Äôs still open. spreading sickness among family stupid selfish? trouble ,he probably still say ,its like flu,its bad,its improving Thing meet friends without going restaurant.

Nobody wants adapt though. Angleish  I‚Äôm definitely trying create conspiracy‚Äî however, directly led lower number yesterday. 

You‚Äôd agree right? That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. NY schools allowing kids take masks desks mean, doesn‚Äôt exactly help reasonable people‚Äôs side lmao IANAL googled lol, believe party chooses charge assault argument self-defense, prove immediate danger option, also defense matched severity threat.

If woman cough like video, pretty clearly longer immediate threat walked away faster could probably react. damage done instant there's really way argue continued immediate threat. punched would assault, even also charged assault first.

However, approaching clear intent cough you, cornered store, legally carrying gun took shot her, wonder would happen. seems obviously way extreme punching her, time case deadly immediate threat (covid-19), action would way neutralize threat since get past let come closer without exposing yourself.

I strongly suspect would hook definitely suggesting shooting anyone, technically seem like scenario would meet criteria self-defense. Perhaps fact odds threat deadly low would factor - only, say, 2% asymptomatic people Florida infected right now, average person IFR 0.5%, there's reasonable argument risk low really deadly threat.

Not worth it. I'm lucky live place seen significant infection numbers I'd like keep way. they're likely experience damaged organs rest lives. We're seeing evidence daily someone recovers they're without continued ill effect. We've seen heart damage, kidney damage, course lung damage, among organs damaged virus. yet, still send child school risk it? psychopaths going sending kids school anytime soon. ACE inhibitors increase number ACE receptors lungs, original concern based on. paid millions cannot isolate weeks?

It‚Äôs actually airports lines described mentality geniuses, except would chose educated dead. I'm biggest fan government, point plentiful morons force hand power act. still insist moron then; take boat find island die on.  Cases per capita second third column right.

Worldometers.info there's per million think exit strategy per hundred thousand go college? guess another factor might wellness marketed way appeals something along lines one's ""feminine instincts"" motherhood. That's probably female equivalent bro science. think it‚Äôs fair say least US wrong thing (overall). 

Yes, certain states areas alright, general federal gov. failed public this. say this, someone else says totally manipulate data, etc 

I know fucking believe see public schools nothing babysitting service working class spend time work.

So lot parents. Reopen schools!~!~!

Seriously though, community would risk governor didn‚Äôt stop schools reopening. live small town Central Valley California it‚Äôs already bad here. Deaths still *low*, county really isn‚Äôt big we‚Äôve seeing higher higher death tolls every days county reports. There‚Äôs many latino families close knit live extended households grandparents. would fucking disaster kids attend schools come home everyday possibly infected.

It really scares happen black households too, lot black children knew growing often raised grandparents. There‚Äôs possible way effectively protect people children get infected.

This little experiment disaster states try it. impossible happen day, unlikely, people become infectious day 2 exposure earliest. Infectiousness tend peak immediately symptom onset (day 5-6). swab positive immediately upon infection, either, takes days virus replicate way upper airway picked swab.

Fox article though it? written Tucker either? thought discussing article? There's easy way accomplish that- maybe wedding 2020 pandemic.   point hybrid exposed fraction people would full school. likely also taking steps reduce cohort even more. 99.7% SURVIVAL RATE think likely daily cases 10K Oct 1.

Right R-nought 1.00....all 4 California, Arizona, Texas, &amp; Florida 1.00....better June/July openings. Maybe, mask campaign/mandates/requirements gov't &amp; retailers helped.

Under 35 people lately house more, schooling requires sharing classrooms hours.

I think college kids mostly infect other; transmission among elementary ages seems relatively low. think middle/high school kids pass COVID-19 act vectors one household another.

Cases probably ramp 2-3 weeks spike early Sept. deaths late Sept. Whether see cases level Summer heights 80k/day again, knows..... saying rise mental health issues seen recently direct response Covid-19 infections.

You again. made statement fact _and absolutely whatsoever_. 

You've called multiple name calling anyone calls it.

It's almost like avoiding others may help. new peak July 17 deaths increasing now......which 14 days later. black we‚Äôd reading smoking weed consider justification. Face masks basic social distancing enough keep R0 around 1. 1 great got number new cases appropriate level. outbreak, R0 1 sucks means outbreak continues level, 1000 new cases day remains 1000 new cases day.

There two gears fighting this. Keep R0 close 1 means allowing economy flow much possible stopping virus growing get R0 close 0 possible, attempt starve virus reduce new daily infections something acceptable.

Think like weight loss vs staying healthy. little bit exercise healthy diet keep weight changing, great healthy weight (Get R0 around 1). obese need step dieting exercise (Get R0 close 0). near fire day increases risk may catch fire.  IANAL, understand it: brought charges knocking out, would show (1) coughing counts physical harm (2) whatever way prevent harming you. 

If cough immediately back away walk hit them, I'm pretty sure able call self-defense. even guess situation ambiguous that. take reducing risky behaviour changing habits. Limiting exercise mean they're going fine running hour. means people likely stop things like ‚Äì example ‚Äì playing golf going long bike rides, go hand-in-hand group people outside household, going takeaway coffee afterwards, etc. 

The curfew stopping people dumb shit like going mate's place drinks. applying potential financial penalty many people give 'out', like rules apply 100% them. people want flagrantly violate rules, feel ""what's harm, I'm going mate's place drinks"", etc. state anyway get everything $40 back.

Idk people let guards down, think you‚Äôre onto something ‚Äúembracing‚Äù them... mean enough us overpowering keeping held shuffle towards well release. probably person called cops Winter coming. Source 20x number deaths claim?

I genuinely curious, see anecdotal articles people terrible lingering symptoms even still testing positive months anecdotal. I've also seen another study claiming \~35% cases including asymptomatic cases type heart scarring indicating long-term damage, almost one seemed actually manifestation ongoing heart problems study scarring.

We seem still lacking solid, large sample size evidence various long-term symptoms. course we'll wait way actually see long-term effects beyond 6 months.

It's super scary possibility, still far certainty. Oh man realize stepping minefield. sorry proven wrong internet upsets much. wish could help :-/

The fact study chose focus ""post-exposure prophylaxis"" ""prophylaxis"" beyond me, since 3-5 days already infected anyways. point think actually makes sense look death rates, long term complications. argument ""this drug bad prophylaxis"", afraid study show either. anything seems support conclusion taking early effective (go read again, people started taking drug early 30% concludes significant difference use HCQ placebo

You keep saying that, actually looked numbers see can't draw conclusion data.  return item possession? mentioning Americans?

And let get right?  want telephone companies automatically share photo location data government. also want choose use mobile phone forced carry one? L L  like 5 6 countries world universal healthcare kind, former soviet nations central africa.

Most civilized nations think taking care citizens worth doing, every nation planet means right it. Corporate States America exception. exactly type person shouldnt able carry gun.  basing statements on? personally seen statistics?  funny would would number.... Semantics. gonna pretend teacher pro athlete socioeconomic bracket? Come now. florida type shit always may not. trial throw appropriate justice her. started drop past days. Stop pessimist appreciate good news.   Using police logic: feared life it‚Äôs self defense ‚Äú Donald Trump, don‚Äôt trust China, China asss ho!!‚Äù People personally accountable decisions. live here. Another reason majority people believe serious masks joke. Therefore nothing needs happen. FB trolls especially angry area called rest country. Many hell bent ""prove wrong"" God, chomping bit bring us back school - I‚Äôm afraid keep messing testing show artificial decreasing numbers. Thank goodness people keep refocusing us breakdown numbers. Like let starve become homeless guess Agreed, would effective agreed measures. states would need give counties cities operating room need, otherwise backfire. 

Ex: TX, counties city mayors determining opening/closing based impact charge enforcing orders. response effective county communicated way population single, clear message. Gov. Abbott (state level) took control took power enforce orders hands cities counties refused allow order determined needed. counties left toothless comes actually making sure measures put place successful enforced. Every link chain introduces another opportunity breakdown effectiveness. appears similar cathode ray tube. spews electrons. I'll bet actually works -- efficiently. *were* efficient, would ionize air room. man covid sticks around post-vaccine FLA like looking may longer retirement capital US anymore Befriend someone manager local super market pharmacy, that's way I'm able find Lysol spray lol. Apparently they're usually gone within half hour stocked. future flu, common colds tend float around too. Overall we're much lighter flu/cold/etc. season years past. Yea basically fuck anyone making living work events huh right, Younger people dying frequently middle age older people. mean they're still suffering enduring effects long recovering. still experience organ damage, heart lungs especially, small % children experiencing condition called ""PIMS""..They're also seeing young people recovered Covid experiencing strokes due damage virus caused infected....

Now, whether chances small great, really fair children risk ignorant irresponsible parents continue try convince big deal despite overwhelming evidence telling they're wrong? child put risk like that? absolutely sickening people look excuse, matter absurd false are, pretend pandemic big deal. pathetic. happens vaccine herd immunity possible? becomes like cold (in sense never goes away) move forward? effective vaccine found US approach 100% wrong. long willing live quarantine vaccine ends years away? long people afford keep economy closed longer support families. Covid-19 real scary, time secondary damage could much worse. notice comment mention preexisting medical conditions higher risk comment enhances mine take extra precaution even illness like common flu. However, change fact whole less severe children flu. mean think less severe age groups simply true. Everything comment still stands. original comment responding saying send children back school ""slaughtered."" hysteria simply wrong. also mentioned comment think going back school factors school systems children's' health. I'm sure problem statements said anything untrue. correct still lot unknowns virus, every comment thread seems people screaming going die kids slaughtered without evidence assertions. I'm simply advocating fact based science based rational discussions without throwing peoples irrational feelings. instance immunocompromised understand extra worries extra level precaution take even pandemic comment made reference to. low wage employers, also small businesses offer sick leave.

My wife works urgent care, actually collecting specimens covid tests. sick leave.

We function without income, health insurance job, gets sick take work, even risk losing job.

But fellow employees lucky would face pressure remain work long possible, risk transmitting covid anyone cared already infected. Crayon would better, Sharpie means business. Well.... that‚Äôs gonna happen. long term effects people worry about, one thing add top. 

The real problem young people spreading virus aware sick. friend goes back visit mom dad, get sick die, people worry young adults need wear mask... know sick might take days weeks symptoms. No, illiterate intentionally making bad faith arguments? 18 red zone based cases 11 based positivity. two different criteria. thresholds document. recalculate based current data. Things marginally better, nowhere near escaping red zone states.  AZ? Still twice high. TX?  little less 2X. 21 states red zone July 28th. 

The document publically released, spokesman VP confirmed authenticity was. So, I'm really sure question whether real. even test nurses weekly. Vareshar, you? I'm USA, we're pretty screwed here. government stealing PPE states sell countries. getting attacked aggressive get attacked. 

This seems like super backwards logic me, sorry find middleground. Herman Cain wouldn‚Äôt gotten close - everybody interacts Trump tested üòí Again....Guys wait settles down. am, looks like America bigger issues trump. Trump seems symptom underlying problems society. Sure can. Half learn could come PBS cartoons. It‚Äôs let‚Äôs open everything stop wearing masks means cancer kill you, meaning cancer killed. he‚Äôs implying mutate harmful strain children already (it hasn‚Äôt) here. always loved learning HS especially good me. understand everyone's experience though...but exist. 

I read article day good deal kids get lunch mental health counseling school. wonder pandemic going affect them. let god back protect us PCR reliable way test **in opinion.** disagree. feel like uptick uncertainty going cause dread, unsure jobs, lack govt leadership,not mention people socially isolated tend depressed anxious. personally, Im anxious simply due fearful kill due chronic illness. survive job, lived poverty doesnt scare me. dont good health nothing. Ah got it, missed part article, thanks clarifying. basically means Ben Carson thinks death rate even worse actually still ok sending teachers students back school. Geez, teacher can‚Äôt even guy today... Yeah, super depressing person share country them. :(

I mean, really dark horrible part would say ""Good, get serious complication die COVID exit gene pool"", a.) know that's wrong b.) believe karmic retribution actually exists c.) already knew two people (who older), died earlier year really want wish another person, matter much despise them. US Phase 3 trials started yet

Edit: Moderna started US phase 3 trials July 27 July 27, day Kodak, well President Donald Trump, announced deal produce ingredients generic drugs response coronavirus pandemic, shares film pioneer soared nearly 25% trading volumes far exceeding previous sessions.¬† wash hands. really, urge state reopen schools knowing damn right schools eventually turn hotspots really care outcomes. reason government bunch governors want schools reopen feel need save stock market rather saving lives. 

Most want everything open immediately ones wads cash stock market lost millions due pandemic. 

It's money, know Donald's days numbered trying squeeze last bit mullah everything comes crashing down. job? Five days week? job qualified pays much still offers benefits retirement plan? spend tens thousands dollars college degree specific profession (and still paying hefty student loan off) you‚Äôre exactly eager see else do. Tenured teachers aren‚Äôt exactly willing give job security. 50% teachers surveyed district either risk live someone sent back anyway. 50% teachers, largest employer county, quit job, going teach kids? open jobs suit needs 50% teachers? woman isn‚Äôt playing martyr. She‚Äôs immunocompromised teacher asked put life risk give income health insurance (not exactly something anyone would willing let go pandemic!) Like man said, ""It is."" there! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* guess going ignore part low transmission Israel. Tell what. there's child deaths 3 months reopen schools, I'll gladly accept point. know case. wife came school throughout book room basically told group teachers live FL ‚Äútax purposes‚Äù (they don‚Äôt live here) basically famous cardiologist/ Head Housing committing tax fraud group underpaid teachers.

Idgaf anything idiot says. cardiologist ASHAMED saying rising evidence heart problems after. lady know 30 healthy, got covid 6 weeks ago enlarged heart. course. I'd love able see family Connecticut Rest symptoms probably hit yet. 

I 103 (didn't know, taken temp yet) back February Sunday felt little ""off,"" told wife planned go work next day (pre-COVID fears), said ""are serious, looked like shit acting delirious, go take temp"" that's found 103. 

Symptoms kicked next day bedridden next four. US delivers aid globally year countries combined. Let's hate entire country many crazies, US lot good. born raised here, came terrible place, nothing perfect, many families like mine, USA saved lives. TIL: corona virus killing many children. Less 1% still thousands people. Stop callous. Wow, thanks pointers. I'll sure get steps now! It‚Äôs like could _that_ much worse... Don‚Äôt forget scared lot us leave New York City said 60 even 80% us would infected. many people left spread disease throughout country. certainly hypocritical. know see big chart Sharpie lines hand-drawn onto definitely trust it. Rural areas: Average IQ education. one. like collective attention span society whittled nothing last 25 years. married, kind makes sense true... virus comprised fatty outer layer, soap breaks turn kills virus. work library similar programs. think makes sense use school library properties distribution, budget. believe library often gets grants sponsors help pay things, know much covers. kids die send back school also lot staff members. could teachers years rushed back school died replaced someone likely less experienced. I‚Äôm saying people going start dying mass people die it, kids, school staff, parents. 

Imagine one kids gets sick doesn‚Äôt die passes parent parent dies? would terrible mention kids would possibly feel guilty rest life. Also imagine kid kid life love. Would still stand opinion school went back? I'm knee deep Portuguese.  maybe English failing me.  mean combative tone. hear out:

 ""This person die cancer"" mean have. 

""This virus mutate"", understand it, implies potential. past occurrence. joking Trump's unusual alignment Putin ppl still support him... funny he's using deaths per cases stat prove US low list, instead per capita...

Because counter argument ""because testing""... acknowledgement Trump seeking months whole ""when test there's cases"" thing. Many rural people Internet sufficient distance learning available them. think actually also counts. Reading \_anything\_ still makes smarter watching TV (which majority people now) Oh bet would. hope people start home school, break dependence state institutionalized education. White House published figures 10k within weeks, worries! time election comes around officially Covid-19 cases USA. Extra paid holiday billionaires. Yeah teachers, school staff, older people kids might infect go home real concern

This kind rhetoric pretty dishonest called self educating. know many brilliant people formal education self taught, read books, exploree surroundings- many many people throughout history. ""it is"" would people windows closed? Unless mean it‚Äôll cold? It‚Äôs true uncle Dr. Pepper front lines well. Says works great used often bleach even cheaper! going on? Numbers massive decline. something changed? No, opposing many months least difficult find something there. China let earlier would easier trust, possibility now. PR standpoint catastrophe damage reputation China considerable time. Sad true. nice story, also getting paid ton money. Lol vote. doctor nurse make expert viruses treat them. people need treatment all, get little symptoms, mean one needs treatment? may work people research shown work everyone. means me, opinion can't used universal treatment. certainly cure. Again, I'm practicing doctor nurse. read literature, experts researchers, opinion it. incredibly irresponsible voice opinion professional, done research extensive background said virus studies. Fox News - New Orleans councilman proclaims he'd rather ""students dumb and...dead."" amount confidently misstating demographics risk COVID astounding. case keeping schools closed hang [schoolchildren significant risk virus. 

It damn creepy see kind apocalyptic pronouncements much support gets versus actual data. ""what fuck supposed schools open group"". 

This group feel bad batch. daughter's school gave option full remote selected. mom's job allowed continue leave school session (as job confirmed still after) money going real issue Fear not, use kind mask school band dentist slip instruments slit mask. Genius!  feel selfish, ignorance stupidity, run amuck.  Like world planning take percieved rights american citizen, tampering election.  

My husband combat vetran and, oh rile up, people claim PTSD, athsma can't wear mask. 80% disabled, 1 funtioning lung severe asthma. shrapnel tear body!  wear mask, everyone else.

 no! got stupid, say plot freedom. Americans fucking dumb. Sadly americans dumb mofos really make us look much worse. bad always outshines good. 

 many deaths, sick people realize real!? loose parents kid, spouse acknowledge maybe maybe wearing mask. 

Or better yet. need live stream covid units medical channel show real effects covid americans, ""scripted"" 

Sometimes hate American. narrative? mean conspiracy theory spread US military via Wuhan military game? exactly that: conspiracy theory.

Scientist try prove negative, literately cannot say ""we proof US military"" remain scientific. say ""there's evidence thing happened"". see support scientific community conspiracy theories either side pacific? That‚Äôs kind going ‚ÄúEverywhere, USA‚Äù isn‚Äôt it? know guy who‚Äôs brilliant surgeon, also fully invested Q conspiracy. right actually. threw 1867 that's first date popped head Quebec indeed much conservative rise syndicalism 40's Duplessis, straw broke camel's back Quebec's left. Thanks pointing out. *Inter*national. Happening Canada too. Plot twist... corona... sifilis. That's simply true. first wave never ended. simply leveled bit. still patted back that. Every country going experience economic hardship, European citizens evicted going hungry work industry currently haulted. Yeah, fines like that, rich people worry fines ever, poor people completely fucked them... reminds bill hicks bit. went waffle house waitress asked what're reading for. answer wind waffle waitress. put far better could.

I hate generalization south. think detracts fact stupid pretty widespread everywhere. Family medical field south keep sending us masks north east. dumb people anti-intellectualism country. Why? easy feels better sympathetic humble. doesn‚Äôt require thinking needs improving let alone imagining what‚Äôs possible.

It feels like it‚Äôs festering better part century can‚Äôt even bring historical discussion happened last month let alone thirty seventy years ago without eyes glazing over. I'm asking, seems pretty much everywhere else said going impose fines, police seem give crap, seems kind pointless. fire thread. Agree everything saying hard pill swallow lot people frequent /r/Coronavirus 

A functioning economic engine ABSOLUTELY essential keeping people healthy. give take lot seem understand. means 50% reduction # infected coworkers come contact with. Obviously, showing work best course option, show up, would rather come contact 90% infected coworkers 50%? right now, Disney going 90%.

A 50% false negative rate test still useful long false positive rate also 50%... isn't, false positive rate even lower PCR testing

Now false positive false negative, would indeed useless, would strictly worse flipping coin, that's case european countries bad waves, testing capacity good compared USA right now. goes USA, difference USA continued spread post wave 1 Europe slowed down.

This means way confirmed positive cases without deaths come 2nd wave. also means testing raw numbers, even though tests per capita lower.

There lot factors, overall situation bad matter much try sugar coat it. It‚Äôs bad leader country masks months moths else maybe could open schools fall everywhere. ironic. frontrunner oxford vaccine, nothing Trump. lead world renowned group scientists one top universities world.  Open windows allow greater air exchange, lessening PPM virus:air. It‚Äôs outside better inside; you‚Äôre going get infected, it‚Äôs better smaller viral load, allow body time mount best defense it‚Äôs able to.

And you‚Äôre misinformed they‚Äôre treating specials; district live teaching person. 

It‚Äôs dangerous students, teachers, administrators. 

And special ed teachers students‚Äô aids (and students themselves) danger, students aren‚Äôt even required wear masks (though understand difficulty attempting impart necessity mask wearing person unable fully comprehend importance, though spectrum capable others understanding). mean, don't. Teachers, example. Others typically figured childcare summer - summer camps like. 

But others know, work understanding work home... they've become less time. stupid? Yeah, welcome America... report HHS gets manipulated data. seem understand this. Also almost states testing processing tests significantly lower rate percentage positive still rising. explains lower numbers cases. Also feds closed federal testing sites made significant lower amount test numbers. cases going testing reporting lower delayed now. watch see gets corrected. new flash: majority victims south black hispanic. know hispanic republicans, can't say them. many died?
How many severe cases? lucky physicians know lots virus opposed mid March Agent Orange say that? elected reality tv host failed businessman Facebook told us to, think people realized covid shitty become. ""Looking back, Costigan, 54, doesn‚Äôt think Gloria, 53, contracted virus separate flights Georgia, family owns home. flights nearly empty passengers crew wore masks, said.""

So mask mandate knew worked? unfortunate, hospital work infections see ages 21-30, deaths 71-80yrs, even though make smaller fraction sick cant swing cat Trump rally without hitting dumb, aggressive assholes Wisconsin... It‚Äôs don‚Äôt care. see education something side cares about. people go back school die consider win book people hate get educated. Mask mandates stupid single business state actually going around enforcing it.

It's 2020 equivalent ""you know pirating movies/music illegal, right?""  Yeah feel you, hate absolute pessimism whole shit show. Keep head up, I'll try best too. It‚Äôs racist say black people dirty. isn‚Äôt uttering ‚Äúdirty black people‚Äù implies, pole behind racist would hide, saying ‚Äúoh meant black people dirty dirty, whole black race.‚Äù It‚Äôs feigned linguistic ignorance. Everyone knows ‚Äúdirty black people!‚Äù expresses general disgust African Americans, ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù expresses similar disgust masculinity. mystery! sure talking New Palestine HS specifically, exactly rural school, suburban Indianapolis Well mean ""more normal"" winter. Like one could least small gatherings friends something small scale. say fully normal COVID still hurt perfectly health individuals, overall stress causes greatly reduced risk people vaccinated  eviction process lost rent, it‚Äôs better pay advance, perhaps many months advance still parties benefit, don‚Äôt know work today, got business back. Tenants larger pieces land would accumulate much stuff take ended complaining neighbors cleanup. applies tenants stayed 5-10 years. last tenants asked leave cleanup, thought scam get Ten years passed see replace them. paid $5000 tenant needed mobile home quickly family. coarse also reasons wanted $5k staying free. sub failure shut down. 

The fact people like upvoted stating misinformation double posts often get upvoted (there 3 posts dead teen top sub yesterday) sad reminder people capable critical thinking. sub bad lockdown skeptics sub. radical idea would high schools asynchronous online learning (or evening video classes). way % teens would make good babysitters would available day younger kids home school. 

For parents younger kids provide funding babysitter. Far cheaper paying parents unemployment similar stay home work kids. 

And teen makes good babysitter, chances assist younger kids learning home too. bought one big 3-packs clorox wipes back March even though already home thought ‚Äúwell, guess could always use these.‚Äù

One best impulse purchases I‚Äôve ever made. bought two bottles months ago. Well yeah, worst way get injured skiing go skiing. Worst way get outbreak work go work. go work. want tested daily 50% accurate anyway risk, feature. minute resources rest us. Probably. also covered police enforcement news employees enforce.

There also 14 day quarantine people COVID-19, violation felony.

That said, rules better cities Democrat mayors like Tupelo, required masks weeks now.  SILENT MAJORITY SPEAK!!! Wait, back March people screaming President doesn‚Äôt power, Governor‚Äôs do. don‚Äôt get change shit fits narrative liked much. Thanks sharing! Mh, much genuinely believing right action take vs. reopening thats autocrat ordered? two shootings area past two weeks. Majority understand economy crash EVEN HARDER ICU every major city full people dying tens thousands home.

It‚Äôs easy reopen educated population understands basic germ theory.

We don‚Äôt USA shut test centres storm? using vaccine approved 45*‚Äôs FDA. plan go overseas it‚Äôs safe.  Needs 4 weeks minimum, 2 weeks waste everyones time.

Before it, House needs get benefits people, Nancy Chuck cage match winner takes all. Ya except didn‚Äôt discover viruses. Nobody research post. countless studies masks N99 surgical since early 2000‚Äôs alone. isn‚Äôt brand new technology people serious stop making excuses people incompetent agendas. Could point chart intellectualism touching humans general? TMZ WaPo duking clicks today. get worse *for Disney*. care employees free time, want outbreak work. they're already telling everyone show work, worst thing trying avoid outbreak work. Even partially accurate test would allow avoid calling infected employees show up, strictly better they're now. supporting idea Covid deadly. agree science. agree schools need open. consistent. 

Would support schools open despite risk? course. 100%. harm closed schools much worse harm open schools. agree many scientific medical bodies believe schools open. Id enroll kids school tomorrow. 

We aren‚Äôt controlling community spread US. Bars, casinos, weddings etc open. Kids next danger themselves, low danger activity. don‚Äôt care transmission, kids least vulnerable group... earth schools closed huge public health consequences closing them? It‚Äôs reactionary nonsense. ""It is"" DJT Gee, almost like urban areas much easier locations spread virus rural South.... 

And say anything Northern liberal, live Georgia Denial temporary state mind. It‚Äôll pass. mean plan, fucking awful is, herd immunity vaccine looks like. knows happen vaccine gets approved? looks like September first one gets approved. Honestly, much hope administration either I'm trying keep whatever hope left ya feel  Lmao....just imagine digital counter 

‚Äú0 days since last *workplace* incident‚Äù It‚Äôs exaggeration compare countries like US. country want stay top. Anything hundreds per day shit better start something it.  father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate 30 years ahead time Uhhhh hundred percent. Supposedly supports decriminalizing marijuana possession, federal legalization. fairly typical politician level wishy-washiness, he's trying avoid strong stance want get attacked it. Many people's views changed decades, I'm honestly worried us getting nation fairly soon. see Biden anything prevent it.

The million person mistake lot bigger deal personally. understand huge popular go war time, everyone worried terrorists hiding around every corner. stand right giant failure. think meant ""aren't"".

Or *very* different parents. need cruise bad! smh course, somebody internet said so. /s Yes lot test results week two late there? would probably see effect hurricane Isaias least days yet? Yes !!!!!! like every business industry, way many overpaid people top actually job all. Administration (and education politicians) spend day thinking things ‚Äúimprove learning‚Äù make actual teachers jump hoops prove worth. come initiative initiative presented lovely power point presentations tell teachers things need add already overwhelming occupation. Oh every ‚Äúnew‚Äù initiative come with? It‚Äôs literally something teachers 20 years ago new name new acronym!!!! it‚Äôs really important pay attention! 

The administration also people add standardized tests need one year. district Iowa waste four days fall spring MAP testing. also added wonderful new ISASP tests spread 11 days - total almost 20 days year wasted !! Standardized test companies 
are 1.7 billion dollar year industry I‚Äôm sure money doesn‚Äôt anything it. digress. 

When class size issues like mental health poverty fore front school success chances, someone got grand idea need administration schools navigate modern world education. rather hiring teachers lower class sizes guidance counselors help current mental health poverty issues, new ‚Äúlead teacher‚Äù program. 

In district 700 kids k-12, ten years ago one full time principal 6-12 one half time activity director admin duties it. 1 principal, 1 assistant principal, 1 risk coordinator, 2 special ed coordinators, 1 tech coordinator, 1 curriculum director, 2 full-time 4 half-time lead teachers (veteran teachers supposed available support teachers don‚Äôt help make programs real teachers learn implement). school hasn‚Äôt improved insane amount money costs pay administrators actually teach one moment one student! Yes; addition pulling great experienced teachers classroom lead teachers, admin people make almost double classroom teachers make annual salary. 

If people actually wanted figure fix school funding issues, START TOP !!!! like blood kids parents...

You shall kill.. guess extend this, shall people get killed using brain god gave us. mostly COVID. money calls actually higher chance winning. People? Expendable. Profits? Chart says shut save it. articles I‚Äôve read, guests interviewed mention visiting park weekly/monthly basis, I‚Äôm guessing annual passholders live close enough daytrip. 
My sis lives Orlando she‚Äôs even big Disney fan - annual pass. husband go evening drinks watch one evening shows, wander around Animal Kingdom night. also see lot kids go school hang out. us Disney big annual trip, want cram much stuff possible short time course we‚Äôre going upset things closed. regulars, it‚Äôs overall atmosphere familiar settings. 

The ambiance night crowds die things start quiet hard describe, it‚Äôs absolutely favorite time parks. magic still without crowds nonstop action, it‚Äôs subdued intimate. feel like Pandemic Disney might somewhat similar that. lived close annual pass, I‚Äôd tempted check out. ass. invariably enter via ass. seeing ads wfh Bahamas days ago problem hearing makes people feel inevitable even less likely wear masks social distance.  Japan going no-test = no-cases strategy since beginning, got lucky strain deal deadly 614G strain, now. paperwork students staff. swipe ID cards get results online.  Based R0 covid won‚Äôt hard. gonna get archivred oof population density factor confirmed case numbers similar, would venture guess density New York created larger viral load within came contact. Could also different dominant strains--- maybe NYC got Italian one. Yeah well it‚Äôs assertion. It‚Äôs hypothesis widely accepted mental healthcare region. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much stretch assume population dealing loss life, loss income, loss housing, loss daily routine, massive air uncertainty concrete goalposts return normalcy would deal elevated level social problems line. I‚Äôm dude lived experienced it. I‚Äôve empirical evidence own, ever state did. mean days people minded business resolved things within family friends instead sneak filming people clout?

I wish. idea said, mind , No. üòï dated someone worked watched fireworks gallery balcony once, that‚Äôs extent coolness. appear bullshitting get funding

oh man described whole scientific career weren‚Äôt moron, you‚Äôre confused it‚Äôs embarrassing. can‚Äôt source claim nothing complete utter dogshit made head. Get help. many people area say there's reason go back school.  Makes nervous Japan lucky first wave non-G strain, China found early enough prevent significant export Japan.

Now they're dealing deadly 614G strain, seed building long time thanks lack transparency foreign military institution brought there. Since stress levels quantifiable? 

Why sustainable long run? sustainable people leave house 8 hours day useless job get money pay house food. 

The military greatest jobs program country - people literally employed bunch nothing (unless think working maintaining equipment never used useful) b/c weird protestant obsession work. 

Improving people's material existence *is* good thing. fact think shows feel humanity suffering whether UBI success not. 

## Abstract

With recent spread SARS-CoV-2 infecting 16 million people worldwide July 28th, 2020, causing 650,000 deaths, desperate need therapeutic agents vaccines. Building knowledge previous outbreaks SARS-CoV-1 MERS, development therapeutic antibodies vaccines COVID-19 taking place unprecedented speed. review, current efforts made toward developing neutralizing antibodies COVID-19 summarized. also highlight importance fruitful antibody development pipeline helpful combatting potential escape plans SARS-CoV-2 including somatic mutations antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). shouldn‚Äôt laughed this, maybe dark humor behind made me. needed that, thanks. Here‚Äôs hoping things don‚Äôt get worse, I‚Äôm holding breath Unfortunately doctors willing straight infect people, continue mask wearing. I‚Äôm starting think may began developing COVID-like symptoms earlier today, persisted. kind hope haven‚Äôt much past days, would love donate antibodies later! high-kicks? high-kicks face throat region? plan. Llnl bang job paper estimating r0 ifr came early outbreak. mostly backed subsequent studies. Also anecdotal, almost every anti-vax Facebook group essential oil pusher made almost entirely women. 

I agree masks though, almost men experience. Like literally everything. California reopening closing, Arkansas reopening probably soon closing again. 

It really makes people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù too. I‚Äôm visiting Arkansas home state right now, people got they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù except nothing closed, really, couple weeks. 

Now everyone making sound like it‚Äôs getting better it‚Äôs worse Arkansas California (or 2 weeks ago.) 
It‚Äôs like per every 1k, x amount sick, Arkansas worse open California closed. 

Like make bad decisions go back them?? 
Thanks listening rant. anyone else send link life long complications. I‚Äôve searching studies can‚Äôt find statistics wanted see anyone knew New York also count probable cause. take account make good point. way testing basically pointless. could take rapid test every morning work everyone else, could end this. put Covid hotel couple weeks you‚Äôre positive, likely back old self weeks. People read article. long extremely detailed. author continually hits nail head throughout piece outlining failures American response pandemic, time highlighting underlying issues led systematic failures crippled nation's response outbreak. Probably best summary seen issues yet. feel better read it. Soooo, good time start high school contact sports then, say? August: hold beer shit show article translation lol Yeeeeeeee harrrrrrrr ü§† Personally, think borderline criminal governments, healthcare experts said children infected, infectious adults. 

We enough sample size make kind judgment. Governments healthcare professionals erred side caution, indisputable evidence, open schools, daycare, etc. so. fiber 1gb connections. we‚Äôre coming along bystander would knocked fucking karen out. Im tired entitlement bullshit. Seriously spanked kid little cunt. truly feels like someone needs knock fucking place.

You‚Äôre alone feeling like person high temperature, person medical issue, might infection. 

Absence temperature imply absence medical issue.  Presence medical issue imply presence temperature.  medical issues infectious diseases.  But, presence temperature one indicator possible medical issue, may enough cause avoid contact issue identified. 

Screeners cannot prevent exposure. reduce probability. every reduction probability, help prevent new infections. 

It game sums. one method guaranteed win. adding together available methods, get pretty good sum. called aerosol transmission new studies say could cause 50% cases. safety gear work 100% sealed hazmat oxygen supply. That's people continue get virus following rules. 

This new flu folks much worship everything Lord Fauchi says, little piece fibre isnt much you. 

In saying that, people elderly, respiratory problems low immune systems take every precaution including wearing masks, isolate. society needs learn live livelihoods ruined, downvote me. 

From CDC website:
""Recommendations wear masks protect wearer droplet infections based assumption droplets travel short distances only, generally 1‚Äì2 m. However, 10 studies horizontal droplet distance, 8 showed droplets travel m, instances ‚âà8 (22). recent study also showed SARS-CoV-2 may transmitted 4 (18).

Take instance policy this, policy, position, etc., reduce instance cherry picking among multiple possibilities/facts (alternative facts!). case kind reopening, various moments cherry picked. they?

\-- open school

\-- idea quelling virus enough open

\-- idea ""it's time, enough time""

\-- idea ""it work, somehow""

\-- idea sacrifice necessary live (but *not level ensue reopening. Note ensuing level accepted school close mass quarantining.*) 

\-- etc.

All ""moments"" picked among range. first one could include, example, ""closed school"", ""the partially opened school"", ""distance learning"", etc. one picked *picked* (cherry picked) *within range*. item similarly cherry picked within range. 

It essential grasp operation happening. Then, dialogue/interaction, one go various moments get precisely cherry picking took place, range was, moments range are, can't glossed ignored, sort like ACA simply allow junk insurance gloss various general categories health financial situations.

People get work actual moments cherry picking. two main features work:

1) laying open moments cherry picking going back ranges ""cherries"" picked

2) making independent, basic theme/issue *cherry picking itself*. means bringing topic cherry picking, plain simple. Saying is, giving examples works, etc. One example use lot say example cherry picking would say know guy 95 years old smoked whole life *never got cancer!* case cherry picking datum used stand data support idea smoking cause cancer, leaving full range circumstances, people make 75 due cancer smoking. obvious one virtually one assail it. 

Anyhow. That's disease. cure. will. seriously doubt anything gets problem better, certainly leave range possibilities open. dude expert Googling. default option open *IF* safely. gets translated people, hear *OPEN SCHOOLS* overlook guidelines data. like experts said *cautiously* open economy *when* good testing capacity Donald Trump translated America ready open. 

Also regardless government direction, accountability us parents ask say without shadow doubt kids dont unknown predisposing factor could lead death.

The answer cannot. There's way know they're hooking 7 year old ventilator. That's late figuring shit out. willfully adding children data collection biosafety level 4 pandemic. 6 months we've found blow straight thru summer, infect multiple organ systems via ACE2 binding.

I dont care. Pre covid always accepted risk acquiring flu, pneumonia, anything else. Life involves risk. start comparing rnaughts death rates.. know deadly, point ita deadly accepting risks acquiring sickness part life. problem nation facing COVID-19 thoroughly summed tweet soundbite, that's 60% population capable thinking in.

You it! see, ""my guns MAGA hat good science"" influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring 2019-2020 season reported CDC week 30. death associated influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus occurred week 9 (the week ending February 29, 2020)
A total 186 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring 2019-2020 season reported CDC.

186? mean, guess might less USA (because Covid seem affect children much, whereas flu opposite) seriously doubt death toll 160k wish kind talk would stop though. don‚Äôt want kids going school kids die, want go school parents will. They‚Äôre making way here. someone said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre dumb NYC, ugly LA, poor Miami.‚Äù curious: write ""Hapsburg""? certain saw this: That's fault scientists though it. fault scientists people believe demon sperm either. mean issue isnt information isnt there, people also need learn effective way. cant give 14 year old book advanced mathematics expect actually able use information it. also people. need lock Swedes. always try state asks us return state force us what's right.

 Currently, schools open here. school wants apply exception, that's reviewed local health officers, consider, among things, available scientific evidence regarding COVID-related risks schools serving elementary-age students; whether in-person instruction provided small, stable cohorts; local epidemiological data; local conditions data contributing inclusion watchlist; availability testing resources, CDPH said. Here's small list potential vaccines indicate either. Actually nothing changed. Still feel like before. simply reason even suspect infected.

Every school district nation massive shortage substitutes right now, feel free sign fill they‚Äôre hospital, attending funerals, etc. think lot people complain taught anything HS pay attention give shit. saying won‚Äôt problems? pandemic first hit, listened scientists cancelled school knocked virus transmission. 

And stable geniuses like Trump Devos looked data showed sick kids. Instead concluding thanks shutting schools, like someone half brain would - stable geniuses determined due fact kids actually 'stoppers disease'. ""post COVID-19""? mean yeah, schools shut pretty much spring break kids didn‚Äôt chance spread it. 

Kids gonna die two months schools reopen. Sure, teaches children effective manner? Parents? think teachers go 4 years college training literally reason whatsoever? think teachers' skills easily mastered literally moron capable reproduction effective teaching child? perhaps think plopping kid front educational YouTube videos effective accredited educator interacting daily basis? get rid teachers anyways give kids tablets teach them?

I'm sick sub diminishing role teachers education process acting like untrained parents magically acquire skills trained teacher. trade off. Instead they'll dumb die things like murder, child abuse etc. already know. links handy quick google show they've released scientific studies show kids great spreaders covid-19. since, said, pulled school. lady work explain me, statement said wasn‚Äôt crazy, lol claim would've outbreak either way. Great logic. 

I‚Äôm sorry misinterpreted me. know pandemic is. country‚Äôs leadership handled one particularly poorly, almost 5 million people gotten sick died covid-19 (so far) result. Unequivocally demonstrably.

What primary complaints modern life people have? complain time make healthy food even time prepare meals all. complain free time time work need things home liesure activities--homelife becomes second job (and poorly done one that). complain level civic activities life decreased since children--that feels like fewer people community helping keeping things running. 

All things side effect two income households. nobody home manage household available outside labor pool things like local civic organizations charity work, individual country suffers. Except kids dying so, fear mongering üò¥ Fall 7 weeks. realize many children single parent works fulfill basic necessities, right? LBH, numbers cannot trusted anymore long time.

1. People need book days advance get test.

2. People need wait 5/10/15 days get results

3. Demand supply test issue now.

4. Closing federal testing centers.

5. WH potentially massaging numbers also. many school age kids died covid last 6 months ? I'll grant president would probably 50,000 deaths now, think we'd MUCH better Trump taken seriously, never called hoax got behind wearing masks became clear helped. lost argument bud. Name-calling doesn‚Äôt change That's fair. again, doctors scientists change minds based new evidence provided. like said, measures open based caveat social distancing possible. can't speak scientists, doctors absolutely change mind matter, atleast case case basis clear school able follow safe measures. Simple, separating under-performing areas one school moving over-performing different school. requires one dose, which, far I'm aware, ChAdOx-1 expected need. see likely would receive vaccine first would vulnerable populations medical workers, essential workers, immunocompromised people, elderly folks. Assuming need booster shot weeks afterwards group would get around 2 doses per person rest population begin vaccinated. 

During time hopefully remaining doses, needles, materials produced they're ready need them. think 100 million enough UK, incredible start. going months rollout reasonable anyone vaccinated, months characterized populations gradually becoming safer :) Smart man, unlike DJokUh. Catch shit lose even 1% lung functioning career over. He's almost done anyway, risk chronic illness rest life (if avoid death). Leaders US trying ignore COVID19. Horrible idiots. Look comment believe components critical thinking. Also, said ‚Äúwill able do‚Äù, ‚Äúwill so‚Äù. However, experience people devoid critical thought, also taught think critically. say even critical thinking taught, person still fall ‚Äúabsolutist‚Äù thought patterns flexibility thought also needs (encouraging curiosity creativity go ways nurture that).

Or, ignore everything said. all, person Bachlor‚Äôs degree Fine Arts, kind academic educational expert (just strong interest logic, science education). end January... went lived hills total isolation 2-1/2 months watched every minute unfold... Fauci ORDERED tell Americans wear masks fucking idiots charge PPE ready discouraged everyday citizens buying masks POLITICAL reasons... Fauci dealt every virus 50 years, think know value masks avoiding infection practically virus... Tell me, long Surgeons, Doctors, Dentists wearing masks do?... I'll tell you, WELL 100 YEARS, yet think leading viral expert country know wearing masks worthwhile... Fauci next time Podium Whitehouse would, front cameras, explain FAT FUCKING MANGO MORON enough supplies emergency actually BURNED previous administrations COHERENT PLAN case Pandemic... ... Unfortunately, leaST 40% AmericaNS, ""Alligator part brain"" speak fucking default setting... pretty common knowledge FDA even screen majority tests high error rate. Accounted what?

You‚Äôre getting right now?? Doesn‚Äôt seem like huge issue, expect big numbers later week cases get reported. Unclear whether big counties affected. doesn‚Äôt affect SoCal counties doesn‚Äôt matter much. positive cases reported, hence 'decline,' bs. last two weeks million new cases. coming weeks people infected new million highest amount far. time schools across country plan opening make transfer rates absolutely skyrocket. honestly understand anyone could think things getting better. Yeah I'm tired financial burden educating kids too. sucks always plan future. current elementary school kids graduate 19 20 instead 18. batch kids staying peer group, think economy society manage. I'd say easier plan long term try cobble things together right uncertainty. There's nothing written stone says every kid door 18 regardless cost/circumstances. raised beds. much easier control soil content moisture, actually pretty good soil growing. prayed better god damn it!! Absolutely. vote indirectly agree care wins. vote ffs. America worst voter turnout earth. Imagine thinking deserved cookie figuring places knew (and done) Or, know, apply one. shame seem inclined push ideological agenda items nothing education then. Probably bigoted.

Ideally, medical offices one place trust taking stuff super seriously. think real. Hospitalization numbers falling time now. doomers hard time believing masks restrictions weeks ago paying off... eventually runs easy fuel (though happens next anyone's guess) read article? Odd see cases skyrocketing despite heavy mask use Ah yes, insults, favorite form conversational debate. Well played. defeated.

It‚Äôs like deliberately trying make kids sick! Bury head sand. Testing appeared hit limit. hotspots smaller states smaller populations getting hit worse big ones per capita :( said once, I'll say again. death rates gonna go roof schools open up.  7000 test? That‚Äôs incredibly pathetic.  Apparently cares little teachers public housing Peak testing maybe 5 whole people? look larger numbers. virus 5 months old US. might know long lasting effects years.

So far identified that, kidney lung damage. untill start large scale testing going know. becomes hard, check internet, find good advice deal difficult situations...


(But always ask ""is reliable source?""  ;-)   ) Well, that's partly true. never going elect scientist doctor president. Difference previous presidents humble willing enough ask listen experts really mattered..most time. 

It's culture entitlement arrogance among right led us mess. paraphrase Asimov, feeling ones ignorance good another person's knowledge. solution? point choice. Good luck antagonizing someone else. Peace. perception check see see virus coming him. Over-exaggeration finest. one hand, right happened far. there's mitigating circumstances:

1. US
2. go flu season kind transmission willful rejection safety measures.

I still think expect milder flu season. starting flu season apathy ignorance, well completely unacceptable failure handling covid outbreaks, leads think flu season still magnitudes worse SK Australia's flu season. one means NoVA MDC say ""the South"". People present data would peaking. I‚Äôd like see ever stopped before? never going away, going keep nursing homes? Ok [Here  think finally forced pass fund, regarding that, remember Jon Stewert vocal issue. one thing:

Anyone isn‚Äôt taking covid seriously Republican fucking reason Republicans think it‚Äôs OK start beating us.

#Vote Want infection rates skyrocket counties better? Open schools there. Nobody teaches core subjects arts, music, etc. feels way do. Average 50-60+ hour workweeks (none get OT pay) across full calendar year. work hours less pay Americans. Hands-down. Again, links prove lieing math there

e: never questioned whether you‚Äôre teacher. you‚Äôve said, you‚Äôre also teaching math English. 4 sided die? ""stronger ever"" numbers steadily declining. One things like other. everyone wearing masks? social distancing? rooms well ventilated? none happened, course cases would rise. Hospitalizations also trending downward FL, AZ, TX. think lesson second ‚Äúwave‚Äù closing bars restaurants asking people wear masks makes big difference. places 50% though. watched Trump's interview Jonathan Swan. Americans feel sorry you. man literally said took president testing kit virus. Also US cases lower world.

Edit - find bleach based disinfectant everywhere, ammonia. annoying, I've used ammonia cutting board switching bleach might make chlorine gas. Gonna spray downs area good ventilation think. would say much anti-intellectualism propaganda. Especially propaganda. People focused political beliefs correct, candidate correct, matter 300 page thesis scientifically true. think much cancer social media (I know reddit form social media. Trust me, know place cancerous too). Shit like facebook people's primary source info. add independent minded, we'll whatever want regard people. I'm saying education system need work. I'm science teacher know fucking needs work. effectively masks depends type mask. far superior others. Well, judging last time peak plateau next peak. understand. posting got deleted right away way Strongly questioning correlation going school educated country... week school already switching every day. give another week switch online. tough. sucks. basically war except stats known far risk pretty much. I'm engineer statistics comfort I'm probably weird compared most. 

I'd think start consoling child explaining works fault. 

Teachers paid much more, too. vague, one wear masks CDC said ago surface transmission common, least comparison method(s). probably happens, washing hands always good hygiene fair precaution take.

The vast majority cases someone infected breathing/coughing/talking/etc... shared space others. Indoor transmission seems far common. Airborne transmission likely part this, driving cases contact minimal none. many? We're unsure. Presymptomatic symptomatic transmission seem driving cases, asymptomatic transmission definitely occurs well.

So yeah, washing hands good practice, comparison mask wearing/social distancing effect overall spread COVID much lower. Sveriges radio (SR) Sveriges television (SVT) state media, rather public service. Big difference. love bug boat. Korea completely truncated flu season basically killed January eradicated Covid first time. course SK great success story early on, point flu easier avoid feeling see really capable year.  kills tens thousands people per year US people even know. Yes maybe mostly kills elderly, occasionally kills healthy young people pregnant women harms babies. hope see (at least areas country taking Covid seriously) continue good habits years future. Maybe cut flu deaths half wash hands, stay home we're sick, wear mask hardcore flu months. Coughing day desk without mask probably acceptable like was. Hoping save lives the

So future social distancing mask wearing flu season possibility limit normal flu? US could use technocrats like her. doctorate essay childhood education, masters child psychology, fifteen years experience teaching elementary  makes around $25k/year spends good chunk right back keeping classroom equipped. 

As teacher myself, gotta call bullshit. Nowhere country school district pay little much time classroom degrees.  


What state referring to? Obviously giving specific school district would go.  much believe idea flu go year, one potential counterpoint... fewer people get flu vaccine year due combination supply shortages, avoiding health care environments due fear covid. Huh? Someone woke angry. You‚Äôre right everyone else wrong, apologize.

When running President? 1% higher death rate younger teachers OK?

 spending 3-4 weeks hospital many others? Essentially. county says 89% event 100 people (for instance day school starts soon.) incredible issue Bill Gates? someone explain?? couple states large numbers simply reporting.  hear May? faith, national measures keep down? Notice said ""most"". tell average American like that. Look many stay US entire lives. Look covid destroying now. Anti Vaxxers around LONG that.

Yeah I'm sure, think many distinctions made terms vaccination critiques... try reddit. almost computers workbooks exist. dont support schools opening up. also feel virtual learning complete waste time teacher. incredibly crappy options, fact opening schools even work anyway might well close them. Anti-masker thinks accurately assessing risk doom porn. Let pick jaw floor put eyes back head. successful, wil great move UK. peak though? downsized testing significant amount? Well Trump would rather everyone dead educated. Educated people vote overwhelming democratic. said peaked would want nothing done see evidence peaking Great stuff, I'm sure /r/HobbyDrama would interested it! remember something ozone treatment coming Russia couple months ago, definitely *rectal* administration. count it. Schools open 3.. 2.. 1.. similar voucher program Betsy DeVos pushing pandemic. serious, fundamental issues works terms equal access education. Per usual, waaaay detrimental poorer students.

Offer services school students able use them. ones money No. Ulrich Beck going save world Coronavirus learned COVID-19 pandemic, one main functions face mask remind oneself invisible dangers signal others one taking risks seriously.

Who reads stuff? believes it? need ideologies, ambivalence, emancipation, skepticism, dogmas, disillusion, claims, standpoints, enlightenment. fancy words ""people cooperate chaos"".

What need leadership. main Dem cosponsor war Iraq enough.

That fair argument. excuse that. least admitted mistake. pretty huge obvious one. admit it. imagine Trump ever admitting mistake? Also, Biden hawk career. actually opposed first Iraq war. even younger Biden opposed Vietnam war. seems like moderate politician tries find consensus go political winds. That's exactly political hero material, orders magnitude better Trump's white-supremacist dog whistling, EPA-gutting, science-denying, I'm-never-at-fault shit. see anyone could think even close. war acting like can't adjust curriculum lmao.

Its delayed, get it.  Yes, lots lines getting longer longer people start coming back parks, well crowded chokepoints retail stores indoor dining areas. false.

*Hospitals* directly reporting data HHS (of CDC part, way).

Case data, test data, fatality data, etc. come directly state health departments. CDC never primary source data. pity voted worst ever President ever ... Nixon must laughing grave. cases hospitalizations falling while, hospitalization data less solid. ""Get rid masks"" ~~tips bigger~~ shut indoor dining FTFY mentioned later reply slight grey area comes self employed, independent contractors. Hence likes Ubers refusal honour law. 

However work agency, zero low hours contract work singular employer absolutely case. 

I expect loophole regarding self employed contractors end closed anyway recent judgement Uber v Aslam case. going well thought would. guess didn‚Äôt read people‚Äôs comments thread then... Testing sites closed Texas, florida places. incorrect. Please stop spreading fake news. invalid comparison. Cable government provide services. Government, however, opt-out. cable company corrupt wasteful, *can* switch (in many places) withdraw support. local bureaucracy inefficient corrupt, there's nothing opt out. They're even insulated democracy. need mess trial, doctors already use ventilated patient since patient low survival rate point. see adults can't act responsibly yet think children going perfectly adhere rules? Smh. You‚Äôll wailing ketchup wipes, HAWTHORNE WIPES! You‚Äôll wiping mustard wipes, PICNIC!! think going kill kids average age people die virus higher average age people die. Ironically another symptom myopia inward-thinking facing nature American culture politics.  Hard say. Everyone make choice go. Surprisingly everyone great wearing masks, even passed family face shields masks. hand sanitizers everywhere clean rides every rounds. Temperatures taken well. vulnerable populations there, although seen people newborns downright dumb. people want sense normalcy taking advantage pass holder/vacation club discounts low wait times. world open point Disney chose now. Oh yeah I'm definitely going keep even pandemic. reasons listed people NASTY. never know someone took big shit, wash hands, started picking things putting back. coughed sneezed blew nose right hands. possibilities endless. Or, hypothetically, massive amounts wage theft.

But that‚Äôd crazy right? Whew. Maybe add spaces break single gigantic paragraph? Would make much easier read comment same? could differently? saying ""every state yourself!"" maybe stepping aside saying ""these scientists know they're talking about, please listen them"" easing lockdown weeks.

There's lot blame pass around sides, think one second things done differently make sure lose many lives. Yes, teach school district whose parent survey 6 weeks. Email, social media platforms, links grading apps, links school fund apps, links signature line every email coming every school employee... got responses 35% families. 60% wanted in-person school. people passionate ones sure voice opinions. families spoke bother complete survey (it put last week May entire month June) said far early decide anything. things would change anyway. government would decide without parent voices.

It's going interesting Fall. I‚Äôve got good news her... students aren‚Äôt fatal risk due caronavirus! (It‚Äôs parents grandparents worried.) Clorox wipes stupid, wasteful expensive. Buy bottle bleach, make mix, use paper towels, literally exact shit except less pollution way less money. Douche move makes News? I'm probably forgetting something

Yes, facts statistics back claims. said, is, factually correct misleading biased without scientific data back up.

* Young people fight virus better, survive. small percentage still sick weeks months vast majority not.
* Young people still catch virus much older people, show less symptoms work force, infect people, unaware sick. extremely rare case get virus first place, is, all, 0.001% world population gotten virus.
* still unsure long term effects seems like even mild cases might get neurological damage. also might not. That's thing using words like might could. indicates possibility certainty. might also become cancer-proof long term. again, might not.
* Finally, put 'value' life span, young people's life valuable older ones, means losing 1 young person, might worst let say, loosing five 70+ year old. according statistics, 1 young person die every 10000 70+ years old. know...this actually kind dope. Bipartisan leadership effort help constituents. That‚Äôs think politician about.

No national policy? Let‚Äôs create regional policy expand others want join. time military would often see leadership incompetent unwilling knew mission needed done. Oh interesting. check out. Thank recommendations. !remindme 1 day think that's accurate fair comparison.

Exactly. **Because handled things responsibly.** Unlike response diseases became established anywhere world beyond originated.

**False.** SARS disappeared due strict lockdowns **various countries**. Ebola controlled **in country** went \*to great lengths properly quarantine people it. Africa still fighting control Ebola flair-ups. Swine Flu **literal** pandemic.

**Look up.**

[In Ultra-Wealthy Greenwich, Teen Parties Lead Jump Virus Cases | New York warm summer weekday middle July Greenwich, Conn., one wealthiest communities country, group teenagers gathered house party. Many seniors finished final year two elite private college-preparatory schools, Greenwich Academy Brunswick School, well local public high school, Greenwich High School, according accounts students school officials.

A single national plan used single cataloging system tests could logged tracking date taken, symptoms, contact tracing data etc allowing mush better modeling people got exposed deduce likely infected.

Without though, right. nuts trying accomplish anything. wish could somehow deport low IQ, selfish, narcissistic, pathological contrarian, anti-education, anti-science Americans replace law-abiding, agreeable, conscientious people Japan similar cultures.

Yes, virus sucks. think anyone enjoying this, guys like Bezos? sooner get shit control, sooner get lives. Assholes making selfish decisions, even small ones, making whole fucking bullshit situation last longer. College students also follow directions usually live parents. freedumb great response exactly going say people arguing schools need open. Thank you.

Also, really wisest course action call entire regions people stupid. offends likely disregard people may right information condescending discussing it. read lots news sources.

The list could go on. makes covid special? 

Governments around world seizing control populations (long covid). deny this?

Again, makes covid special? Machiavellian point view, perfect covid-19 gives way covid-20, covid-21, etc., provides nice/neat depersonalized scapegoat power hungry.

I add, way conspiracy theorist. legitimate reason wary happening right now. Legitimate sense NOBODY degree understanding history politics could reasonably disagree. even left vs right right vs wrong you‚Äôre wrong side history appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* target educated alive? Ok really think cops, shot at, thought ""oh guy's white let's shoot legs""? That's huge stretch. I've never heard police ever trained shoot wound. 

More likely get good shot got lucky hit anything important. 

I'd suggest donut operator's video incident. agree believe would long haul across many programs divisions government. think there's recognition people getting fed status quo.

I think question ""when"" ""how,"" ""if."" ""I'd sooner trust random YouTube video Facebook user actual scientist medical professional""

Yeah that's par course people. Death family members completely normal, natural course events. Wasting whole year home years body desperatedly needs stimuli not.

I'm saying virus dangerous, im critical sacrificing wellbeing youth order save mostly elders. Omfg I'm 31 already three kids welcome move Massachusetts come fourth child want. actual fuck. orphaned... Record lows?

**Deaths**: we‚Äôre currently rolling average 1125 deaths/day. highest it‚Äôs since late May, low 521 early July. indication even reached peak yet (much less passed it).

He's already used year, maybe days' worth saved horizon get sick. send people home symptoms, I'll bet many employees still come work sick desperately need money. know... kinda weird mostly active specific hours too. still hoping sign obsessed (self-diagnosed, said recent post) person, malicious one. yet proven right. forgot China. need reliable way test t-cell responses/immunity. me, seems clear something well understood going virus everyone actually develops antibodies. 

I starting suspect large piece general population pre-existing level resistance infection based t-cell responses past coronaviruses, prevents COVID antibodies ever developing response needed. reopening considered!

How *you* know ""trustworthy"" makes ""good"" vaccine? probably don't.

Unless scientist develops vaccines, likely know makes vaccine ""trustworthy"" listening *scientists* say vaccines, developed makes function properly. trust saying truth.

But scientists say new vaccine ""trustworthy"" choose believe saying truth something else said.

So people lost cause. trust already fits chosen narrative.

Most people (self included) accept way depths **a lot** dumber think are. I‚Äôm retail. can‚Äôt leave floor every five minutes wash hands needed use lots sanitizer. number people cough hands hand things, argh.

They worse compared neighbors stricter policies. Even cigarettes BUGS them? (See post.)

Well that‚Äôs credit card disputes for. Merchants cannot charge damaged inoperative goods (per Credit Card &amp; merchant contract) I‚Äôm workin it! data probably exist emergency use. fact people coming ventilators alone huge. NY showed 10% patients came ventilators. I'd guess that's reason anything else. Ireland, we've several clusters slaughterhouses (usually Romanian Brazilian workers) past week uptick cases largely caused big cluster pet food factory staffed refugee workers live cramped overcrowded accommodation likely bussed work every day. perseverance foresight

I u want yell someone. know want yell entire state daily like he's trying kill many people possible. you. never explicitly stated ""biggest blind spot"" although seems implying danger adults. Must protect alcohol consumption. Yea everything deaths continuing climb climb spike Texas, California, Florida, Arizona. interesting see years estimate total deaths USA. expect it‚Äôs much higher people still wiping stuff? totally unnecessary..... learnt touch face without freshly washed hands now. gloves also worthless wasteful.

i see people wearing gloves adjusting masks/touching faces lol. entire existence waste. 

The gloves highlight point. jobs focusing US hard make clorox? could least opening mask making factories like 2008. know cause worked one. actually specifically says pro-vaccine Plandemic video. particular vaccines believes research fraudulent. specifically calls yearly flu vaccines effective.

IMO saying vaccines good like saying drugs good. really can't make accurate blanket statement huge field.

Not say adds validity claims think important critique actually said. No, right. isn‚Äôt useful all. sure you‚Äôre trying defend overview study hasn‚Äôt happened yet, aggressively. Yes freedumbs hard say though, guy assault rifle shooting identified police officers, shot lower extremities, hail bullets.

Then there's cases several unarmed black non-violent criminals shot fatally. Tamir Rice one comes mind, park toy gun (unknown time toy) cops basically ambushed patrol car shot down, killing him. 

I get every case different really bad optics. single approach. Public health safety shouldn‚Äôt states‚Äô rights issue.

And despite that, people shitting Florida's state government taking recommended precautions. irony strong here. ignorant comment WTH!? Crazy people. Spaceballs: Tombstone! o7 Holy crap... never thought that! o7 successful USA

Sweden still higher deaths per million US though. Please do! Missing full year socialization peers devastating mental health though. I‚Äôm commenting content one article. article source. I‚Äôm saying overall numbers correct. They‚Äôre not. article makes sound like there‚Äôs cover isn‚Äôt, one situation article outlines. 

Again....I agree overall. bad reporting, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm talking about. mistaken Texas. Texas update systems Sunday. updated numbers Monday. ""Class health issue, people charge care. Tom weather."" Lets get back testing that's way Anti maskers don‚Äôt deserve participate society. US drastically underreporting deaths, certain states anyways. doubled five year average ""pneumonia"" deaths half 2020. Cardiac arrests respiratory failure deaths home 20-50% southern states. Excess deaths extremely high compared nations. Even including missed COVID deaths (including Feb/March testing together) 4% worlds population almost quarter deaths pretty.

On top positivity rate good, that's important statistic determining testing going bad spread is. higher positivity rate, cases missing. We're Brazil, Peru, Mexico's level, we're well compared Euro Asian nations. 

The high death rate Europe also great part got hit first, early days know properly treat virus. intubating patients way early. effected NY Tristate breakout, high death rate states. time spread rest US learned better treat new options like Remdesivir.

Now next thing, catching cases good... early contact tracing. none this. people waiting weeks results, that's worthless test right there. contact tracing virtually non-existent.

Cases drastically going vast amounts virus circulating within borders, we're testing more. fact states like Florida others south testing capacity, massive backlogs. along high positivity rate states shows us lot virus circulating tests accounting for.

Edit: sentence  nice burn. dont find odd seminar ETCHING exactly happening now?

No, spent entire education early career hearing virologists rant exact scenario would happen eventually one prepared. question whether would influenza coronavirus. recall 911 dispatcher claimed Florida saying much third cases/deaths reported state. sisterfuckers fought human rights half hard fight assumed entitlements, would living utopia right now. also see negative average mortality (compared 5-year baseline) since July 11th (average around -25/day July 26th, think data complete yet). avoid large autumn mortality, year might end within normal excess mortality others.

Surgical masks may prevent two people directly infecting one another it‚Äôs airborne flow air around mask infect space stagnant air. risk infection enter room room person even everyone wearing mask.

You're wrong, incredibly wrong, ability public school kids learn remote settings. kids yes, kids no. combined availability support home, results vastly different outcomes different children. 

Kind like class does, ignore pretend best system everyone.

Every single one kids better spring. Kid High School never higher 70% average semester pulled 85%. Middle kid grade 5 well basically became teachers assistant. 

Youngest getting needs met school already. already putting HUGE time effort getting speech reading. teacher basically incompetent came teaching remotely.

Despite that, able help redirect, guide, keep task allowed make progress months learning home we'd ever seen before.

There single system learning. We've known decades intents purposes done fuck information. Learning remote learning well possible, I'd argue absolutely necessary develop add tool school systems.  councilman New Orleans said he'd rather kids dumb alive educated dead.  This.

My teens believe nonsense they're told parents, anti-maskers. high religious population school, believe prayer solution. Teens also sometimes dicks. like push boundaries obviously wearing mask going easiest way ""stick man"" harass classmate. Kids also malicious. might cough teacher like spite, thinking joke think they're clean- meanwhile kid asymptomatic killed teacher. Kids/teens understand gravity actions they're 25-ish certainly brand-new disease sweeping world. hit end game yet, know they're contributing towards.

Or let's say kid overwhelming responsible they're uncomfortable take second scratch nose, that's takes. Look idiots TV screaming right wear mask- anticipating children act better adults they're seeing around them?

I think people say ""the kids wear masks!"" control room 25+ children 7 hours day. 

In NYC, kids going eating classrooms instead cafeterias help social distancing. kids take masks eat classroom sit day, what's point masks first place? supervising eat chat, masks off? Plus there's plans right test students en masse, starting day 1 mostly likely positive student.

None even taking consideration students special needs struggle regulate normal circumstances. 

I think office-type folks realize teachers already pay cleaning materials classroom. channels buy ""more"" sanitizer wipes simply there, getting purchased school first place. NYC, usually get reimbursed $250 DOE classroom expenses, already took away year.

When see major outbreaks coronavirus slaughterhouses, due‚Ä¶

Yes, one really knows sure.

‚ÄúIt system failure slaughterhouses worldwide. seen pattern US, England, Ireland, Germany elsewhere. strange, ¬´says Hans J√∏rn Kolmos, professor clinical microbiology University Southern Denmark expert hygiene infection humans animals.

In Denmark, question highly topical 62 900 employees Danish Crown's slaughterhouse Ringsted tested positive. scientific literature field limited.

""None articles describe infectious events result major outbreaks SARS-CoV-2 meat processing similar food processing plants,"" states German research team new study outbreak Germany's largest slaughterhouse.

But plenty theories. Roughly speaking, fall three categories: migrant worker theory, work environment theory animal theory. Information tries give overview here.

Eastern Europeans
In Germany, relatively high proportion Poles migrant workers employed country's slaughterhouses mentioned possible explanation.

""It fact come Eastern Europe problem. cramped living conditions, walk close other, course something contributes virus spreading easily, ""says Allan Randrup Thomsen, professor virology University Copenhagen.

Also Danish Crown's slaughterhouse Ringsted, many employees Eastern Europe, company's press manager, Jens Hansen, told TV 2. According press manager, majority live together small apartments, share toilet drive together work.

But explanation, question see similar outbreaks industries also make use foreign labor large scale, says Hans J√∏rn Kolmos.

""For example, seen metro construction,"" says.

Nor German research team investigated outbreak coronavirus Germany's largest slaughterhouse found evidence primary explanation. Sharing Apartments, Bedrooms, Cars ‚Äúdoes appear played major role original outbreak described study,‚Äù states article, yet peer review. However, researchers add 'very well' may factor relation second larger outbreak came month first.

Cold air poor ventilation
Another widespread theory working environment indoor climate slaughterhouses.

""We dealing relatively dense environment cool air, virus likes spread,"" says Allan Randrup Thomsen.

""At time, probably speak loudly communicate, course means drops sent longer journey otherwise.""

Through analyzes samples infected employees, German research team investigated outbreak German slaughterhouse believes trace majority infection back one employee. results suggest infection occurred workplace, infected colleagues worked way eight meters away. possible, researchers explain, among things, low temperatures poor indoor climate. air slaughterhouse recycled unfiltered air conditioners fans.

""Our results indicate physical distance two meters enough prevent spread environments like this,"" researchers conclude.

Infected animals
Finally, ""the elephant room"", Hans J√∏rn Kolmos puts it.

""It could animals bring virus infect employees slaughtered,"" says.

It theory currently relatively alone with.

'Nor saying pigs carriers. think investigate it, ""says Hans J√∏rn Kolmos.

""It caught thin air, pigs receptor airways similar humans.""

He also refers fact outbreak corona infection mink farms Hj√∏rring, time outbreak epidemic area. Preliminary results genetic studies Statens Serum Institut shown infected animals humans one mink farms ""infected other"", infection also involved several sick residents nursing home city. However, whether humans infected animals, whether infection gone way, study could determine.

Mink fed, among things, slaughterhouse waste pig slaughterhouses could potentially infected way, Hans J√∏rn Kolmos explains. hand, attempts far made infect pigs coronavirus able prove animals became infected sick, explains.

‚ÄòBut small attempts, it‚Äôs flimsy foundation. also rule pigs carriers virus without getting sick, ""he says.

Allan Randrup Thomsen immediately skeptical theory.

""Of course never say never,"" says.

‚ÄúBut think theoretical consideration rather practical one. come across anything literature supports pigs could support replication particular coronavirus. "" wearing masks 'progressive' entitled, selfish stupid exactly?

Not stupid enough compare wearing mask protect virus 99% death rate fighting world wars killed almost 100 million people...

I would definitely fight person self defense find good lawyer afterwards. FIGHT life someone tries kill disgusting things like TRYING infect virus kill slowly painfully word trying kill people. say nothing, since article states went earlier health violations, felt anything break up. had, shooting might happened. name wealthy country distrustful US (or western world broadly) china? Well, rest assured, rest year he's contrarian masks basic science. lot folks locally got pissed tried claim suicides worse possible death toll. Several suicides accidental overdoses that's whole issue. Absence evidence odd evidence absence. Herd immunity may achievable. There‚Äôs enough data make definitive statement either way. lot posts break rules, experience. one one example, although understand intentional.

Do mods tell many times content reported? I've never gotten treatment... enough you? talked doctors fill death certificates, think confusion cause death, it‚Äôs probably due error crush patients deaths attempt intentionally inflate death numbers COVID. think likely see exaggerated hospitalization numbers US federal payment structure, people would hospital anyway, like asymptomatic person recovering unrelated surgery. Bunch racist comments showed notifications magically disappeared. Thank Reddit? Doctors RMC said encountered two patients infected first surge virus spring returned hospital confirmed coronavirus cases.

Magadia said, it‚Äôs possible tests right people catch virus once. think they're related since study France Trump fucked Americans can‚Äôt come ate countries can. Brilliant everyone perfectly work. threshold estimates vary, far 100% perfect compliance. There's also study know demonstrated laypeople wearing masks imperfectly puts greater risk disease other. 

I agree many wear imperfectly, faith Swedish people matter Swedish authorities do. think Swedes pefectly capable wearing masks. They'll probably better populations even. makes Tegnell's statements implying hard silly. Good cancelling - tough call responsible thing :) Yes, ask comparisons beyond bullshit anyway, since systems work differently, systems different states begin (Sweden long queues even pandemic) etc one leaving job? affording that? 1/3 country climate, dead educated backed school. Yeah would lmao, can't teach shit online. right side pain.  comes quickly 10-20mins subsides hour so. vomiting, throw til everythings gone, soon theres something, comes. Tried hot cocoa mostly water thought heat would help soothe sore throat.......very big mistake, sour thing come back up. No. We're country earth. Look Israel. low Covid-19 transmission rates reopened schools early May. Cabinet currently debating full lockdown mid-August. reason?

Yeah checking bit seem accurate  You‚Äôre right, experts science wrong, you, right. Go wide open, let go, doesn‚Äôt matter me, I‚Äôm happy hell working home enjoying house.got kids hell teachers, let get sick. Good luck you! Disney world actually interesting case analyze. unnecessary risk taken, happening anyway, might well learn something.

It seems like fairly well *so far*. Why? First obvious reason, time spent outdoors moving attractions lots air exchange.

Second, everyone 2 wearing masks, types mask strictly enforced, bullshit attempts circumvent rules tolerated all.

Third, strict social distancing enforced.

Fourth, everything constantly sanitized.

In words, exactly china get Wuhan control first place, exactly U.S. willing do. wrong laughable. guess protests ok mass gathering live event's, fuck outta Yeah education useless alive use it. 159K people dead, THAT'S SAY IT!!! People please remember vote monster out. Thank don‚Äôt see articles ICU nurses writing wills. Lol fuck american schools ever education? like expressing genuine surprise statistic downvoted I'm sure lot people thought. disagree all. underlying issue thought process.

What money spent on?

Capital spend operational spend accounted for. operational spend going right bucket here. teachers still lowest paid professionals world. ""supervisors"" administrator getting lion's share money, way ""school board"".

If put cap spending rest money could funneled correct bucket, namely teacher salaries classroom equipment teachers, differences would shocking.

We would funding rebuild classrooms properly protect teachers crazy time. Wear face shield top mask. Trust gut, admin. Stay safe. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. give October latest. We‚Äôll lockdown even worse second wave much worse peak!

2021 also write off! I'd say reopening quickly precautions. see measures northeast worked, they've kept relatively suppressed afterward. southern states low numbers much exposure, took mean safe go back normal; problem small numbers cases quickly become big ones controlled well. 

It really ending shutdowns early killer, rather shutdowns strict enough. fucking horrifying Focusing everything power reopen 100% soon possible. disagree classroom likely far better younger kids, education-wise. think distance learning fully replace that. finding better balance safety learning Covid Year.

That said, many quarters/semesters/years schools spent teaching youngsters remotely? We're absolutely going get effective teaching way practice. Again, think ever going fully replace classroom learning, comparing decades practice something tried first time, rush, past spring really fair comparison either.

I'm responding parent comment, also general atmosphere thread (to degree ""adding even zeroes"" end bail). atmosphere that, opinion, precipitated dog-eat-dog nature political arena post-Trump; shifted Overton window away traditional understanding law order, toward law order motivated animosity vengeance. I'm sure seen yourself. I'm disgusted assaulter separate beliefs adhere laws ideals. They're mutually exclusive.  Gofundme funding criminal activity defenses. understand someone would think screaming employee want help you. like know make complaint return without total asshole.  

I spend couple years Costco merchandise return people freaking nuts.

It's hard one cares. I'm 21 I'm one taking seriously since DECEMBER. see hope Let's honest: people like terrible every imaginable way. hope right There's ""bail amount"", amount court wants pay order get jail (or ""held over""), there's ""bond amount"" amount pay contract bond agent agrees foot bill run away show court trial. bond amount typically 10% bail amount.

Many news stories use two terms interchangeably, thing. bad reporting. surprised turns nearly 100%. 

 COVID-19 super-spreader events happen? Based list I‚Äôve assembled, short answer is: Wherever whenever people other‚Äôs faces, laughing, shouting, cheering, sobbing, singing, greeting, praying. don‚Äôt 19th-century German bacteriologist MIT expert mucosalivary ballistics understand tells us likely mode transmission.

It‚Äôs worth scanning myriad forms common human activity aren‚Äôt represented among listed SSEs: watching movies theater, train bus, attending theater, opera, symphony (these latter activities may seem like rarified examples, important take stock wealthy infectees got sick March, consider New York City major COVID-19 hot spot). activities people often find surrounded strangers densely packed rooms‚Äîas above-described SSEs‚Äîbut, crucially, attendees also expected sit still talk hushed tones."" reservations week Disney. Cancelled plans May knowing wasn‚Äôt going go away. 

What don‚Äôt understand someone would pay full price watered experience. Correct wrong, restaurants closed, can‚Äôt park hop, services unavailable. going pay full price? think confused. Maybe wrote poorly. tried warn friends dangerous covid was. One best friends back March disagreed CDC friend telling wasnt dangerous. thought watching event unfolding seeing dangerous China ignorant best friend CDC telling nothing. example text sent me. CDC sending people home back March everyghing ""under control"". (CDC dispatched employee directly handling Covid cases March) influenced friend nothing media blowing porportion. BARLEY covering news. restraunts closed. Hence dont trust CDC.  Lol, hypocrisy coming incredible. 

Hint: I'm scientist, primary concern. Reinfections almost certainly happening, they've observed literally every existing coronavirus. questions are, what's average duration immunity what's extent reinfection, particularly regards said above. asking reason keep bonds, gave one. words, make list pros cons. I'm saying cons. Finally someone realizes fucked ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù really is. Okay said attacking you. Buy toilet paper deserve shot coughing someone

During pandemic? That's bioterrorism.

Idk law's take would be, imo responding bioterrorism deadly force 100% justified. large majority world hasnt? fact new cases still climbing?

Edit: literally math here. 1 person spreads 18, say spread happens day, exceed 11 billion people 11 days...

I'm career works public too, I've situation lot. see new person bad attitude, seem angry, whatever, know probably they're overwhelmed. tolerate abuse there's bad mood, staying positive feeding potential argument helped much. usually end telling whatever stressing they're whole different person. someone hear out! Obviously every public-facing worker obligated anyone bad mood, I'm sharing that's part job specifically I'm always amazed difference.

I'd hypocrite expected everyone openly cheerful time, anyway. always try polite least, days social anxiety makes eye contact conversation really hard, people might see unfriendly one days. try worry much though, strangers think none business! think read something r/econmonitor day said money FED injecting via QE isn‚Äôt even ‚Äòin market‚Äô. #üßÉüßÉüßÉüßÉüßÉüßÉüßÉüßÉüßÉ happened several times recorded posted thinking they‚Äôre right. 155k dead people wear masks millions infected.  nonsensical trying claim act trying spread covid19 others done malice intent harm.

We people running around masks public yelling ""All Lives Matter"".

It's painfully obvious people really mean ""no lives matter"", would wearing mask. Multi generational living one roof might become popular means end nursing homes stuff. Lmao please tell wearing reusable cloth mask microns 3 (coronavirus transmits 0.1 microns) helps.

It‚Äôs another way divide nation

I send sources too. I‚Äôd ask same. care think. friends Asia think fine that, I'm going go around HIV positive friend I'm going protect wearing mask on. Provided asshole running around without mask kill us Covid breath first. true though? 

How else would explain US one lowest CASE fatality rates world? Trump currently championing hard. 

South Korea 2.31%, Norway 2.79%, US 3.3%, Germany 4.3%, Sweden 7.1%, Canada 7.64%, Italy 14%, France 16.1%.

Clearly Trump point US low case fatality rates, also seems champion US top tests per population. two facts explain other, seems eluded him. 

Catching cases good thing, 14% people who's coronavirus Italy probably die, likely missed lot cases. keep amount testing constant growth cases increasing, still means bad though. work purchasing agent college. I've orders Clorox wipes (through various vendors) since early March. seen single canister come in. goes Purell brand hand sanitizer. 

We seeing companies pick start producing mass quantities. Clean Cut primary one seen disinfecting wipes. local distillery that's begun producing hand sanitizer, chemistry department even while. According several (very frustrated defeated sounding) vendors I've spoken to, Clorox even giving estimates able fulfill orders point.  Huh almost like idea weak central government stupid idea.. Probably wearing mask often associated wearer illed. Especially Asian cultures.

Unless ongoing smog/haze, air pollution problem, wearing niche purposes (breath training, celebrities etc) time gives signal feeling well. People bitching stock market doesn‚Äôt take away fact millions jobless struggling. gonna happen unfortunately. many weird anti-mask conspiracy types. Target - Method Antibac spray, Walmart - Lysol purpose cleaner. Oregon. Dont find interesting called Covid 19? existing experience Covid like viruses, people work understand process threat.

That would include modeling discussing possibilities experience learned previous viruses.

They complex biological processes fully understood, especially affects human body.

This tool release control. profit center game. biology happening human history.

Please, cant act like adult help solve issues, dont get way real work silly games. BIG difference saying...

a) article, 80% people infected Denmark hit typical Danish strain, 
b) 20% cases come abroad opening borders. 

You simply don‚Äôt know. clue. enough information make claim. 

The way potentially make claim like actually traced cases abroad *after* opening borders. maybe SSI have...? hope so, hope thought government-run services suposed near-perfect? That‚Äôs people keep telling (make healthcare government-run).

So why‚Äôs failing hard government schools?

(ponder) six year old, tell teacher. Teaching child read actually difficult I'm finding. children always receptive parents teaching.

And time? work too. School telling expect 5 hours day schoolwork first grader. can't put first grader front bunch work walk away. work like 

And one child. Imagine actually go work (we work remote now) 2 3 kids elementary age?

These early stages learning important. developmental windows children learn certain things (like reading) certain ages seriously struggle catch up. lots lots studies this.

This going end disastrous manslaughter conspiracy time. First ‚Äútouched‚Äù doctors. they‚Äôve ‚Äútouched‚Äù Fox news. deliver PSA Texas?! Specifically laws?! 

I'm trying keep husband kids alive. feels like Texas cares haircuts manicures earth anyone think x 1000 send kids back?

Uneducated idiots listen politicians instead scientists. Even though still 20 000 test per day regular basis ü§£ highest form intelligence, something clearly lack. Hold beer. That‚Äôs pathetic. son 25 taught basic things started kindergarten, gifted classes also spend lot time projects etc. parents busy (and I‚Äôm saying work obviously) watching Netflix posting Facebook? Hold beer watch this! go listen trumps pet birx then.. see gets you. car accidents spreading now? get car accident, pass car accident multiple people, pass even further? Big news true. RIP Indiana's kids teachers children live bubble, completely divorced rest society?

Or live homes families other, vulnerable people? Kicking cases gave kids teacher last year cold season. would disagree semantics. look definition lockdown, fulfilled. Nothing enforced really, people could still go please. bit lockdown. shutting nonessential businesses recommending people shelter place. states even that. 

Certain states Northeast region probably closest actually locking down. Maybe could refer ""semi-lockdowns"", lot also cooperation public. nation really come close. Many people chose self isolate, still do, never effort government enforce it, help people stay home providing aid outside temporary unemployment benefits laid due COVID $1200 check. really lockdown. initiated Stafford Act brought National Guard uniform enforce that, providing essential aid need, would lockdown. 1984 Orwell. 2+2=3. that's time works said nothing political. That‚Äôs projection. 

Studies flawed can‚Äôt account real world, people use incorrectly. see day long live. 

Faucci said people touch face even mask. it‚Äôs half-assed BS. Yes 15 15? 15 45? enough data get excited anything here, agree need data Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Regression fixable. many kids high school take gap years. Losing 1 year education might set kids back some, they'll still life life family members. I'll take bunch kids need 2-3 months remedial education bunch dead kids anyday.  I've got simple idea..

Instead spending trillions year protect brown people overseas..

Maybe reinvest lot cash into.. dunno.. Americans. Lol, like whole opening school argument education. No, it‚Äôs not, administration care education, many dumb ass data show children ‚Äúsuper-spreaders‚Äù jury wether even spread rate normal adults. make decisions based bad data pseudoscience terrible horrible good idea shouted every opportunity. lmao doubt shortages toilet paper, masks hand sanitizer. industry gone overdrive.

I desire kids participate that. Kids could literally learn nothing whole year fall far behind. They'd 5-7 months waiting vaccine. Daycares dangerous schools. need keep kids home. parents work, find childcare solutions involve mass gatherings germ spreaders. Again, 7 months tops situation. Patience focus saving lives need, panicking anecdotes less important things. I'm commenting reaction would federal government set something like this.

Anyone fraction brain power knows ""people"" claim kids immune spreaders lying, greedy, selfish, psychopath narcissists. thanks. makes sense considerably older. 1970's. interesting behavior pops sorts evo-bio-anthro-ology disciplines. Vice signalling equally interesting counterpoint.

But yeah five years right started becoming commonly used insult online, ""SJW"" peaked starting fall off, plenty overlap. find interesting (and lesser extent ""slacktivist"") don't, inherently anyway, deride perceived virtue, justice activism - they're accusation inadequacy, hypocrisy, inflated sense self. practice they're probably mostly used attack people virtuous oversignal smaller cache virtue, fraudulently style warriors justice history makes claims reasonable, etc... wording really addresses falseness. reliable counter coronavirus cases/deaths USA? 

 number seemed free fall past days, something impossible exponential growth virus ESPECIALLY deaths, seems ""peak"" massive case rises past month. 

Seems like deaths started go exponentially, could take suddenly dropped. lackluster/broken school system. Look much poor districts state spend per student. probably shocked. want point title may accurate. confirmed whether COVID-19 killed boy not. COVID died, causal relationship confirmed.

In case clear I'm saying COVID serious.  see sarcasm subtle simple mind like decipher. Carry on. Thank you! hate people compare rates ignoring positive impacts Sweden made. still f'd much every Scandinavian country (more deaths economic impact), everyone better US.

Go back Fox News leave science scientists. Fuk day. Karma coming can't wait. hear Covid19 pretty wide spread jail. districts spend much per student horrible outcomes.

[No, don't.] amount money spend per student correlates success.

Urban school districts often problems. Due white flight, many left expensive facilities can't properly maintain reduced income, leading deterioration debt. Even well known confounding factor trend obvious consistent.  Thank isn‚Äôt exactly right. Wealthy parents also spend lot money resources outside school enhance student‚Äôs learning (e.g., summer camp, tutoring, trips museums, computers, healthcare, higher quality food) whereas poorer families may able make difference therefore rely heavily school. Look education production function work Stanford professor Sean Reardon. Another qualitative example: guidance counselors lower-income schools may spend time focusing student mental health supports, whereas higher income schools, spend time supporting college placement.

that‚Äôs previous commenter said - you‚Äôre attacking [straw infection deaths continue increase. best ‚Äúrip bandaid off‚Äù push slow burn? I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm one making decision. Hopefully make right one. think understanding trying tell you. 

I read Barley Grass one treatment, ... Wow! There‚Äôs headline never thought I‚Äôd see. world come to? shut Chyyyyna travel kind guy basement probably done maybe. else could ask for? even debate this? would probably effective. Teachers also this-boycott schools. risks around however. Ok school aged children. You‚Äôre better assuming everyone around ill, making choice conduct place point.

We‚Äôd lot safer assumed us sick. assumed sick, would wear mask protect others. I'm sure school district attended, assure going absolutely impossible lot schools set socially distanced classrooms, especially schools low income areas. went Detroit public schools many classes 50ish us crammed one regular sized classroom. Unless things changed since 90s (doubt it), simply enough rooms, teachers, money budget spread further. like teach outside MI winter, either. 

This wish one hand, shit situation. course everyone wants schools open, reality. Instead, going force schools open unsafe manner (because let's honest, following CDC guidelines even properly funded school district pipe dream), bunch people going get sick/die, close again. people needlessly suffer outcome already predicting, say ""we tried."" hard believe, true. Look going 2 vs going extra point, look rate punts short distances first down. mathematically proven coaches refuse it. coaches also ones win time.

Basically anti intellectual stigma football runs rampant, especially among coaches. continually preach 'you can't Moneyball football!' can. want sport different isn't. know mean Moneyball, great book great movie. Written guy Big Short, another great book great movie.

I doubt teams capable using analysis, choose to.

As replacing kickers, true. extremely hard replace. Physically dozens hundreds guys country kick well them. problem mental game hard guys handle it. reason 70,000 people boo chant 'you suck' miss field goal breaks can't make kicks anymore. guys handle fine pressure, top average aim, tend league 10-20 years since hard replace. literally stay leg strength gives struggle make high 40's anymore. Yes already happening states public schools. unable locate wipes, bought lysol disinfectant spray surfaces use reusable cloth, rags made old tshirts, paper towels. groceries, spray onto cloth wipe down. would jammed  even decrease r value 50% would enough ""Some may die, sacrifice willing make."" tool wall street probably. he's blowing hot air asses. 150k people haven‚Äôt died car accidents last 5 months. number going yo grow exponentially. Sweat much?? ever drink before? Karens complaining loudest elearning first threaten lawsuits kids start getting infected.

You're right misinformation becoming norm; sadly, creating false sense security some. Rona TB....the dynamic duo. Well done! Plus cops love angry white guys shoot people. Angry white guys shooting people things *supposed* be; always want imminent threat mass shooter keep people frightened wanting cops around.

Hence, letting run around making sure ended nice dramatic arrest. probably hoping he'd kill someone overnight make really impressive, do. Imagine dying go Applebee's ""I good authority people right head armed stressed still behave like reasonable people firearms"" 

Well would hope so. email? call BS one Glad admit it. Acceptance first step... unclear? Really? They're severely underreporting right since trump took releasing testing info. Tbf, ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù also means ‚Äúthe ability every american job pays enough live.‚Äù 

We‚Äôre point America last legs can‚Äôt afford another shutdown, fucked first one big time didn‚Äôt right. thought kids got mild cases covid-19, would die? accustomed able personalize kid‚Äôs education

So, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain would options. one(s) choosing? Every website I‚Äôve says 14 Drinks week 4 day. don‚Äôt enjoy drinking doesn‚Äôt mean spread false bullshit everyone else. RIP. Sad hope family okay. school open? Speaking vaccines. I‚Äôve read less 50% get flu shot year. many going get COVID vaccine. tell I‚Äôm definitely going front line. 

Also since 7 solid months this, shouldn‚Äôt start sort scientific evidence long term complications? hear people issues nothing widespread. Alright man, asking sources trolling, guess trolling? anyone know contracted virus? couldn‚Äôt find details article. Yeah thanks don‚Äôt watch news. traveled work different countries 25-year period. Luckily travel work home. end hated airplane traveling much, spend vacations car. also says something pandemic hit someone posts 1000 comments Reddit mentions Sweden 800 times... Teachers, multigenerational families. Support staff. them? hell, governor could make laws slow spread schools open safely Fellow redditors, software developer myself, help dealing covid-19? 

For example people develop covid contact tracing app. medical frontliners sacrificing life face-to-face virus, home, part too.

Do suggestions? literally can‚Äôt refute without admitting assumed risk without COVID. guess problem title then, three fifths fuck treatments discussed. parents can‚Äôt that?  say that, employers schools require vaccine attendance majority people get vaccinated think OP's comment something sick days. ran 50k tests, 31.6k new individuals. 17% positive latter, suggesting heavy hospital tests. Something closed, either lab testing intake. Fuck representatives. Unionize workplace. you‚Äôre speculating. know article 10 20 thousand probable covid cases weren‚Äôt recorded? Why? Cover up? Probably. Can't even imagine news order see positive reaction. 

It could like ""Russia fell apart 50 states"". wholly agree. One day dip cause alarm, some. 

Time tell, helping either verify paranoia, show reasonable justification lower numbers. Sell CNN news organization. assure dissertations throughly checked multiple faculty members

Remote learning address fact school treated de facto daycare system, allowing parents go work.

For remote learning widely acceptable first need get people working home, else way kids supervised remote learning. think giving options great, long teachers/staff options without penalty. parents child young go school, think older i'd consider drop version last option needed work. Seeing articles makes proud work company do. Work property management company 25 apartment complexes. entire time we've kinds programs take care residents employees.

Alexa, Germany? There‚Äôs always big drop weekend. Whenever see numbers line (example yesterday Worlometers) look individual States - yesterday didn‚Äôt report all. look counties reported not, even go county websites. Sometimes data gets adjusted later. delays WorldoMeters pretty good noting adjustments. find, example provides good numbers  individual counties Texas. use similar sites track infections Toronto mum lives, Lexington MIL lives.

It‚Äôs PITA research feel better tracking data directly vs aggregate sites. Omg never learn Unfortunately, lot people US worried laid contract virus awaiting results tests. protections sick workers. Kinda saving life kid time. Can't raise kid dead. meets friend went neighbours two days ago gets sick anyway. near inevitability current climate think much time resources wasted right prepare schools opening inevitably close. could using time money prepare virtual learning. painful watch poorly executed. Even non-draconian public health measures easily get R 2. Currently US even Florida Georgia 1.5. that's need vaccine eradication relatively easy. still concerts indoor BUA long long time. like LMFA, right? Everyone gets coronavirus going die end. politician able change mind. hope gets well enough fight says wants. happens want.

Unemployment checks come 600$ federal stipends top it. incorrect though. 1200 every two weeks. 2400 month. Well, coronaviruses generally end. 

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, absolutely will. point children‚Äôs susceptibility COVID-19 likely less flu, one talks shutting schools flu outbreaks, wonder is...  Hope property. gonna easy selling lunatics next door. Gosh, wish felt sorry them. 1. say that. said that's default position, places high local spread (which 1/3 U.S. point) show caution. idiots interpret comments broad recommendation open everywhere.

2. alot people dying deaths still going up. I‚Äôm sure would way easier control dumb That‚Äôs odd, since insurance tends cover anything that‚Äôs preventative, since it‚Äôs cheaper dealing actually get sick. would rather students missed 2 years classroom education alive parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, neighbors otherwise. classroom place convert dumb people educated people. good thing Florida state try batshit crazy (opening schools) states see happen. states already know turn out. Sweden still higher deaths per million US though.

The US seems significantly reporting deaths though, I'm entirely sure. (US excess mortality year much higher reported COVID deaths, whereas Sweden's excess mortality COVID death values extremely close one another.) highly doubt richest among us lost anything significance. economy explain us sham. might shitty parents, ""I fucking idea"" selectable response? true. work mental health clinic therapists masters degrees counseling licenses. Yet, one thought good idea go vacationing Las Vegas last week even though COVID last month contracting graduation party. childish mocking BoMbS!! single day outlier. continues 1000 next days I'd start presume something fishy going on. also sale time Clorox Wipes, enough last awhile üôè could asymptomatic. test gain data ‚Äúhidden spread‚Äù ‚Äúhidden figures‚Äù bad idea. thing is, count healed active cases. It‚Äôs pretty crazy camp everything could based rules.  still can‚Äôt believe July 10th, summer camps would allowed operate conditions.  It‚Äôs fucking crazy.  hell country doing? think testing centers closed, idea many tested? Hey wait... promised vaccine coming October! 

/s able buy container wipes last week. First time since beginning March.

Our Aldi recently removed space shelf. getting enough stock use internally cleaning. makes sense. /u/HeyImMeLOL upvoted rightly so, share unease. 

It's bit odd WaPo numbers show deaths halving today weekend, despite clear reason deaths slow like drastically Sun Belt. 

More point, wholly lack faith *why* White House worked hard bypass CDC. effect, it? suspect shady motivation. Whether works time tell. reasoning, observation. one, months since pandemic began.

It @ 7 months, maybe 10 months, depending consider start. Re-infections China, Italy, etc. would numerous re-infection likely.

At latest count find roughly 15 people appear re-infected, half within 3 months (which likely single infection person felt better, virus fully defeated flared back up). even assume 15 re-infections, still conclude re-infection rate effectively 0%. Second, possible people confirmed case covid much likely careful comes wearing masks social distancing, cutting probability reexposure. 

Highly unlikely. First foremost, overwhelming majority persons (95%+) symptomatic COVID19 mild symptoms, recover within days. keep before, fact polls found recovered persons going more, returning normal life longer concerned getting spreading COVID19. moment wait time get testing site, many people choosing pay $200-$300 dollars pocket rapid testing site rather sitting work 2 weeks, rapid tests included official State count. local numbers include rapid tests though. think 97% accurate test positive 80% accurate u test negative actually it. yeah tests far spot way 'low rate deaths' reported misleading makes people think kids almost immune danger send consequences.

I specifically talking you, general media message. actually agree believe previous record 581 sadly ""most"" small margin see logic that, spreading much worse right Florida Texas back March case? Yes, let's talk illness *far* less contagious, less likely hospitalize adult, vaccinated against. I'm sure kids died it, what's point? entire point.

This article prove men likely fall Covid-19 conspiracy theories (which OP &amp; article incorrectly claim), rather proves already fallen them.

Many thread jumping rash conclusions therefore directly related either:

A. direct biological differences

B. toxic masculinity

When infact complicated variables considered - men came across theories, whether pedallers targeting men first place, on. - kind scrutiny rightly applied link. Many parents can't afford take time work supervise kids help day schoolwork. comes jobs offering livable wages allow one parent provide childcare works, employers offering little paid leave. forces parents can't afford childcare choose job child's safety. also lack public infrastructure allowing widespread cheap Internet access. Ok, flu? 5000 cases. 245 dead today sucks though prevent students getting sick spreading it?

Is supposed to? parents prioritize getting kids house kids getting sick, so, get wish. mean, someone upload video loved one actively dying ventilator? Even loved one gave consent somehow, would want see loved one dying splashed news? would not. 

Also, people - point - still virus deniers going swayed watching someone know die. now, going take someone deeply love getting getting sick it. incredible we're going let states sacrifice families this.

How fucking dystopian.

Although considering fact they're inheriting climate change extinction, perhaps teaching age hold value beyond much money make Bezos correct lesson.

And we, society, determine good lesson teach kids aware schools start November. cannot vote problem away. Ohhhh yeah. One best friends married one highly qualified teachers state - doctorate essay childhood education, masters child psychology, fifteen years experience teaching elementary, generally beloved students, peers, faculty (and also absolutely lovely person.) 

She makes around $25k/year spends good chunk right back keeping classroom equipped. sad thing could making twice expensive private school, loves help kids advantages wealth brings. Fun fact, everyone district *knows* they're almost certainly going shut move distance learning sooner later, county commissioner back going ahead publicly stated schools going open time couple months ago want look bad, virus spread damned. I‚Äôll try keep dirty mouth then. you‚Äôre saying schools never go back season child dies flu? going chaotic teachers whether school opens not, kids, parents teachers start getting sick covid imagine chaotic try switch virtual learning teaching everyone homes running fevers short breath. dont understand anyone- parents especially- think okay send kids back school person. lunch coworker talking face face 30minutes

Over decade ago Chomsky wrote book called Failed States explicitly showcased US shared commonalities ‚Äúfailed states‚Äù militarily intervened in, US becoming increasingly danger citizens. sudden fall grace - people cataloguing decades.
The US lagging behind quite important metrics Trump, many politicians across board placing little importance systemic failings. course, diversity approaches (with Trump/ modern GOP genuinely terrifying), resistance really address issues implement strong change needed widespread. getting Trump office isn‚Äôt enough tackle false American exceptionalism need change.
Here metrics US lagging behind (per capita):
Following blueprint 2016 report Organization Economic Cooperation Development (OECD)
The US second-highest rate poverty among rich countries (This includes standardized poverty measure, adjusted country)
According 2012 UNICEF study, 23.1% US kids live poverty. studies place number little lower, 20%, numbers much higher advanced countries. black Hispanic American children, poverty rate even higher, 36% 31%.
Obesity primary indicator poor diet, although US isn‚Äôt fattest country world (several Pacific island countries, well Qatar Egypt, precede it), leads OECD countries obesity.
Americans spend nearly 17% GDP health care, yearly per capita cost $9,400. That‚Äôs $1,600 second-highest spender, Luxembourg, double OECD average.
The US fewer physicians, hospital beds, psychiatric care beds economically advanced countries, ranking towards bottom parameters.¬†¬†The US also advanced economy world full health coverage population.
Child mortality higher US advanced economy (even adjusted reporting differences), adult Americans also live shorter lives: Average US life expectancy 78.8 years, nearly two years less OECD average. comparison, Japan longest life expectancy OECD, 83.7 years.
The US also stands one countries world maternal mortality increased, rather decreasing, past 15 years.
In US, early childhood education attended fewer children (55% versus OECD average 84% attendance), older age (four years old, versus three years old), administered untrained professionals.
US women‚Äôs political representation also leaves much desired, less 20% congressional seats occupied women. Sweden, OECD leader, nearly 45% national parliament, global average nearly 27%. Female representation boards publicly traded US companies also OECD average. top off, gender wage gap also bigger US.
The US also, Lesotho, one two countries world mandate paid maternity leave.
Only 12% US energy output renewable, far European, world OECD average.
Current US investment infrastructure 75% average OECD nation.
The US highest income inequality rich countries. Income inequality calculated OECD combining several indexes, including ratio income highest 10% lowest 10%.
Deaths assault almost five times high US OECD average
When comes democratic institution, US one lowest turnouts among high-income countries. (The US one countries eligible citizens aren‚Äôt automatically registered vote.) [edit: countries like Belgium, Sweden, Denmark regularly get 80+% voting age population voting, US gets around 50%, plus 6+ million felony disenfranchised 2016, addition many means voter average American worker works 400 hours per year (10 40 hour weeks) average workers Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, etc. Americans mandated vacation time. Denmark, Netherlands ~30+ days paid vacation + paid public holiday.
The United States currently require employees access paid sick days address short-term illnesses short-term illness family member. 24% civilian workers United States, roughly 33.6 million people, access paid sick leave. addition, overall economic mobility low.
These metrics show US can, should, improve. Additional metrics would include: racial wealth/income gaps, Deaths Despair (worrying trend showing massive increases suicides, drug OD, alcohol deaths, etc, last 20 years), collective bargaining (see OECD rankings US ranking near dead last), student debt, etc. It‚Äôs hard spend lot money economy sucks nearly impossible find name brand cleaners Chicago brand disinfectants still easily found.

Except, Coronavirus dangerous students? kind education getting place? worry huge amount fish around me. love sharks. ignorant. teachers whether want take risks. virus targets elderly mostly. healthy parents 20s, 30s, even 40s much worry about. kids much risk unless preexisting conditions, case option send them. Simple. teachers younger they're much risk either. teachers support staff families. spent last week emailing conservative father (pretty intelligent, medical doctor extra masters degree unrelated field), basically came conclusion: point, developed worldview (for instance, government inherently evil can't trust it) point cherry picked information support worldview use intelligence excuse that. rest us dumb see liberals lies. could have. unknown would states asserting states rights.

They immediately fined jailed 8 hours 5 days well. pandemic. work utterly predictably, like literally every single aspect pandemic played failed state call America. arent requiring students quarantine exposure Unless side believes reporting lies, daily numbers dropping steadily fairly rapidly lot states past two weeks. heard medical opinions waves.

The first question among pros first wave pass? 

*Then* try prepare second wave. Sharks chill. dont swim areas people intentional feed them. mean education system already failed multiple generations Americans. either way call educated actually understand numbers still low.

Competent national leadership? made mention mortality rate either disease children. use soap &amp; water? Handwashing soap effective sanitizer &amp; suspect true cleaning counter. Like someone posted another sub, really reason govt continues push towards education even though heavily try defund ignore actually educated people (i.e. scientists)? 

I'm sure many teachers mind recording lectures uploading (or livestreaming) youtube unlisted students watch home rather sit school close others major pandemic. anyone actually believe Florida 5000 day now? Yeah, last year really shaken belief common sense common. media half problem, yes. 24/7 ""if bleeds, leads"" news cycle poor arbiter information public health crisis. going get lot distortion.

The half problem (and huge contributor media issue), least US Brazil, government seems interested propagandizing informing. agree - virus isnt deadly enough world wide movement vaccinate every person.

Unfortunately, means areas least able deal outbreaks dealing them. First world countries vaccinate see small outbreaks dumb ass anti-vaxx crowd. I‚Äôm starting think people peaked right learned first words. Lol many people barely understand viruses, diseases, anything directly related minimum need get by. literally war crime. Gauging shape curve, nothing suggests otherwise yet. TN one Fauci Birx‚Äôs watch list recently. Heads others like KY, OH, things seem moving northward. know infected? murder dare use links them. Would define child dying flu preventable? Ok ignoring 60 something thousand deaths, (Even people still die matter what) gives us 100000 deaths 4 months still way higher flu. They're also inaccurate they're likely give false positive results. That's big reason they're (and not) counted state's positive case tally. 

I agree useful screening tool though. Rapid test, PCR test confirm. Man Florida alone many daily cases summer... certainly deep South vibe like get Atlanta Charleston, shades there. hard describe, compared Philly, Chicago, New York, different culture, feel Southern influences. Part neighborhood spend time around. 

And course, there's joke Northern hospitality, southern efficiency. ;) said ""deaducated""  Republicans: both? Good thing local schools opening next week! spending time parents would make kill themselves? r/selfawarewolves step change productivity due computers economists largely puzzled productivity really risen sharply It‚Äôs crazy political whole thing gone. state literally cancelled school till day election. can‚Äôt make shit up. 

They said going revisit reopening Wednesday November 3rd estimated restart November 9th. 

Not even trying hide it... pretty wild honestly  lot truth this. social distancing, flu vaccine, masks, able handle flu.

ALSO, flu AWFUL last flu season. daughter, vaccinated managed get mild case flu virtually every kid school got it. feel like January feel like every person talked stuck home flu kid it.

Hopefully previous bad season makes people little less susceptible getting fall. Simple answer, claim false shame. done good job beginning. Soap works better, read directions Clorox wipes, need left contact surface prolonged periods. people use product wrong. teach children? *&lt;...insert Goodfellas laughing lot countries really making unsafe decisions beholden human invention market. thing actual power. sort like religious gods.

A state like Connecticut reasonably debate now, Georgia? still crest first wave? god damn minds. political leaders basically saying they'll never get control? said virus killed basic soap water soap mechanically breaks apart membrane? can't people use soap water wash things down? Youd almost say idiots exist every where. Thankfully German one's tiny minority. nailed it.  You‚Äôd spend day enforcing safety measures tiny fraction teaching. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm expecting happen anyway. 

The government wants schools open parents go back work, specifically kids learn. Yes, support single, national strategy. Ultimately question support national strategy, whatever may be, much support single national strategy, whatever may be. One must read survey/polls healthy dose skepticism. Dissatisfaction current response mean unity response. Congress something like 20% approval rating, yet keep getting elected... People need chill disinfectants.

Ill see out. I'm young teacher glad school online time numbers go down. ask get numbers. overall death rate whole population estimated 0.5 - 0.75%. death rate young people far less 0.1% look data. Amongst deaths occurred last week reported CDC, less 1% reported deaths occurred ages 0 - 34.

Generally, random sampling purpose given antibody tests way estimate IFR. Trying suss positive tests fool's errand really need done anymore. COVID IFR location dependent, somewhere 0.6% 0.8% western countries elderly populations. India/Africa lower due age distributions countries. Herman Cain tell that?

## Abstract

Recent outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) led pandemic COVID-19. absence therapeutic drug vaccine causing severe loss life economy worldwide. SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 employ host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 spike (S) protein priming viral entry host cells. potential way reduce initial site SARS-CoV-2 infection may inhibit activity TMPRSS2. current study, three-dimensional structure TMPRSS2 generated homology modelling subsequently validated number parameters. structure-based virtual screening Selleckchem database performed ‚ÄòVirtual Work Flow‚Äô (VSW) find potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat bromhexine known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence used control molecules throughout study. Based better dock score, binding-free energy binding interactions compared control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, Ambroxol) found promising TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed number significant binding interactions binding site amino residues TMPRSS2. all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated proposed molecules retain inside receptor dynamic states. binding energy calculated MD simulation trajectories also favour strong affinity molecules towards TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong bioflavonoid class phytochemicals reported possess antiviral activity, study indicates possible potential application COVID-19. ‚ÄúMask wars‚Äù sounds like something horror movie... Jesus. guess entire pandemic feels like time US though. Fuck asshole, come teach school shut fuck up. see tension building Iowa (Republican Gov Reynolds want's in-person learning). One county already indicated writing going run schools see fit. Unfortunately party charge floundering pandemic, nationally polls dropping. Feels president desperation mode, see recent interview:

How handle mass casualty events pandemic? also heard people hot spot states buying negative covid tests don‚Äôt quarantine. sure it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs major issue true.

Given average length WDW visit expect many actual outbreaks parks themselves- real danger always Disney's role national superspreader virus, especially parks become crowded again. Considering still really know much covid antibodies, terms length immunity, nah slightest. We're still even sure antibodies still contagious whilst asymptomatic (as case measles, chickenpox etc).

Age majority Michigan 18. Can't blame parents everything. Wholeheartedly agree 100%. US really country per se - landmass made constituent countries.

So...

Also, fine criminal penalty I'm exactly sure going this. Reckless driving (and DUI/OWI/etc.) range penalties depending multiple factors. simple charge reckless driving speaking to. person responded say anything comparing DUI personal injuries kept apples apples. waited till Tuesday, update.

It's much know necessary laws, necessary lawmakers. likely steroid worked though. dexamethasone? 47.5k cases day good news?

I get lower 60k US seeing 2 weeks ago schools opening back up, fear trend again.

Compared almost everywhere world, 40k+ per day shockingly high. parents, lower/middle income families certainly are. wife lucky work jobs recognize are. But, also worked asses get here.

As kids? freaking blessed awesome kiddos get it. also 3 stunted bit, built socialization one.

Poor, mentally ill, POC BB gun? Gunned street questions asked. I'm going respond assuming genuinely curious hear counter argument. vein respectful debate. 

While certainly technically accurate assumed risk regardless COVID, ignores fact risks associated COVID additive pre-existing base risks transportation accidents, school shootings, regular disease transmission, etc. top risk students due COVID (probably low short term, still know possible long term complications) much serious risk posed adults interact millions children everyday. Children almost certainly act vector transmission adult population teachers, parents, live-in grandparents, administration, janitors, maintenance staff, dining workers. population significantly susceptible serious complications due COVID. 

Ignoring additive risk someone would probably take issue false equivalence

What schools probably complicated problem solve society, opinion. None simple straight forward.

Have nice day! fair, Clemson time alive. mean based tell reddit. pretty good chance dead dumb. livelihoods killing people? kind question that? heard Mississippi Georgia opened schools already. school start early? dont think start PA till last week August.   Texas including antibody tests positive results, back MAY nothing current article says RECENT change CASE reporting. Who's saying completely cancel school? Remote learning option kids. main issue happens elementary Wearing proper PPE practicing proper hygeine akin condom wearing.

Which simply possible schools. There's way socially distance PPE hand washing going get around virus spreading people close contact daily basis. still think reasonable vaccinate high-risk groups basic safety tested ADE unlikely. rampant epidemic, society ignoring distancing, 1:10 death rate pretty much guarantee serious damage, stage 3 vaccine reasonable choice them.

Also, many 80+ people immunosuppressed phase 3 trials? them, remain pretty much untested. interesting observations. think animal model found settle question. Seriously, thought would good idea sit front camera let talk supervision 37 minutes? politicians speak language. really disagree transmissible. actually nothing measles terms transmission rate- disease able mostly get control. fact, measles considered childhood disease adults least already exposed time reached adulthood.

And many viruses circulate animals. number make jump. That's nothing new. need better prepared next pandemic.   really need stop posting daily totals go moving weekly average instead.  Well tbf remote learning doesn‚Äôt work Sweden approach never nothing. poster showed Sweden put lot measures control spread. 

What Sweden impose hard lockdown. argument marathon sprint. Hard lockdowns wear population inevitably pandemic fatigue counter productive fighting pandemic.

Consider following lockdown BC lifted told keep social contacts 60 precent normal less prevent reemergence virus. Sweden 60, soon reopened jumped 75 percent. seems doubt filter droplets aerosol used correctly. crazy people disputing that. much effective preventing spread C-19 applied community settings huge question mark simply don‚Äôt quality data trials required get unethical perform.

Where things get murky weather result less community spread C-19 practice consider individuals governments using masks way make things possible aren‚Äôt otherwise good idea. see time, people government leaders saying ‚Äúif wore masks, could X‚Äù depending we‚Äôll masks work, consider fact many people don‚Äôt use correctly, may find practice may lead spread, due people things otherwise wouldn‚Äôt do. post article Osterholm putting eloquently detail. üò∑

 recent photo wearing mythological mask doubt TSA risks sometimes wonder people caring Virus anymore socializing like pre-covid times, people get work free time? think countries tend better behaved children schools, TBH. mouse demands blood sacrifice. You‚Äôre making completely different point now. dead CTE diagnosis. literally look brain. means diagnosing CTE happens difficult. correlation football that's know far. Canada getting ready ship kids back school well province increasing rates new cases month go school returns. time sports also opening again. Online clear split Parents desperate get distance/online education parents desperate kids go back school. Viral damage organs somewhat common lot different viruses. isn‚Äôt exclusive particular virus people wanna act like reason. ever mono? also causes lasting damage yet it‚Äôs common almost right passage kid! 

Viral damage tends resolve time im inclined think permanent. True. mostly going case case basis one size fits solution. School administrators earn salaries figure out. guys peaking?? ""know local area"" respond appropriately pandemic. fallacy used crutch current administration pass buck state local agencies.

That Tim hardware Becky Alpha Sigma Tau leading COVID response city. 'Winter coming' suddenly sounds frightening would antithetical Republican strategy. never happen scrap power. lies throughout video? patents vaccines? way government works vaccines? realize still know exactly covid came from. appears know taking about. I'm shocked.  concerned this, also SUPER concerned long term damage virus could children. causes mass infertility (which read something long ago think might)? kids get infected, end infertile...aren't doomed species point?

Could asteroid?  jesus dont even care say anymore hes said enough already make realize kind person is....which sadly reflection America general.....:/ sponge tipped bottle, like old shoe polish/carpet cleaner bottles. approximately 42% Americans totally noodles. course. Florida closed state-run sites projected path. seems mostly complaining sake Select state-supported testing sites impacted Hurricane Isaias closed July 30 reopen August Testing sites Charlotte, Escambia, Hillsborough, Lake, Lee, Leon, Manatee, Okaloosa, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk Sarasota remain open. going go party practice going go party events. don‚Äôt respect teammates stay safe going respect strangers. far 2nd round they? symptoms worse better first time? I've heard anecdotal reports people getting virus twice before. seem follow timeline months least. uncomfortable interview... feel like father son squabbling who's best quarterback. CTE real deadly, still know exactly CTE developed. example, possible CTE developed child teenager playing football, someone starts college can't get CTE. also understand sports get lot CTE sports similar hitting. 

The point CTE real strongly linked football, enough data say exactly happens. You‚Äôre wrong failing us, it‚Äôs pretty privileged view. Schools also function safe childcare extremely necessary source food lot families. Particularly minority families get serious legal trouble kids taken away poverty truancy. totally clear, schools open, it‚Äôs sometimes easy keeping kid home iPad months. soap doesnt kill virus. can't really disinfect things it. Unless alchohol based soap.

You idiots downvoting really believe regular soap disinfects deactivates virus lmao? Holy shit dumb, wonder spreading, regular soap washes away, doesnt deactivate it. point it‚Äôs easier list doesn‚Äôt need quarantine 2 weeks. never liked anyway.

Now excuse.

No stranger presumed right touch me, ever again. People cooped months looking things argue social media TV. thing people twitter telling sports media members rooting sports fail tweeting facts improbability completing season face COVID-19. 

The thing pisses people high risk areas subjecting policies communities high risk. country 330 million people everyone right different situation. Opening schools dumb, closing even dumber. need handle county bu county basis, never hear moronic media members prefer spit talking points facts Exactly.

**But anyone also realize ""Back School"" corporate term business among government, $$$ like always is?**

They ""care"", alright. dollar signs need love. either open schools, almost certainly lead COVID-19 heartbreak. close schools, keep people safer COVID-19 certainly lead significant amount consequences

This false dichotomy.

The sensible option open schools if/when cases, close temporarily many COVID cases. done every year seasonal flu - schools close week flu cases get control. 

The thing we're really lacking US rapid, cheap COVID testing every kid could tested every day school. would help prevent situation COVID cases begin spread rapidly given school. people die limited attend wedding. live Georgia Cherokee county. rumor ‚Äúleaked‚Äù intel stating school board knows schools go full digital September, want kids meet teachers face face. virus happy attitude. That's entire classroom kids dead. Kids dying preventable disease. number kids dying already outpacing amount die flu.

Also, schools closed since country exposed virus. Kids can't really travel freely, literally home time. know extent risks exposing hundreds thousands kids virus. 

This even considering likely children spread virus home members family. Well, look around adults... Lol pretty good associate selfish, ignorant cnts either dumb care others both. late May, Texas trying set stage reopening. removed antibody tests make look like cases gone down, could reopen eventually kill lot people. Republican governors fucking rot hell.  Man wonder pretend believe god. sad true really specified it‚Äôs well SOUTHERN states. I.e. compared worst hit states they‚Äôre bad!

Absolutely ridiculous take. not, unfortunate wanted reference often. Exactly. Vaccines take weeks kick fully... Unless double-shot vaccine...

Then weeks first shot second shot, weeks second shot full immunity kick in.

So... Months. better I. hobby sound fun thats 26.4 million americans. Dont downer.

&amp;#x200B;

s/ New Orleans dumb alive best they're gonna get. Especially since [Covid found highest concentration Please tell still this. Aren‚Äôt made plastic? Use fucking rag.  I‚Äôd like weigh this. mother school district business manager, might biased, still.  (limited) experience jobs often require support staff, higher hours. mother instance often worked 50-60 hour weeks. also work year around (at least district management does), good group really boost school.  school district used attend faired better corona shut early. already ability distribute chrome books students could attend online classes, offer free lunches. Granted know school exceptional upper management, people devoted school. Also pay really wouldn‚Äôt go far toward paying teachers. Though get payed much teachers there‚Äôs one many teachers. Personally think fault lack respect education America. respect towards teachers, emphasis learning itself. Death concern coronavirus. still use slowpoke meme? saying smart idea go, lot overcrowding stuff everyone wanting ""first"". Everything see posted shows resorts lot less busy. think good idea go? No, especially local, also jam packed full people 24/7.  No, may either less dumb answer, maybe actually still passing interest field completely unrelated own. Could smalltalk question too, like ""How Nicks?"" doctor gave equivalent response ""I follow hockey, sorry."" I'm confused, change talking happen? mistake back May fixed, nothing current drop/plateau cases. 

I see anything Newsweek article says recently changed reporting method. trying smug, fucking moron Depressed upvote. understand flu. 

We still don‚Äôt fully understand long term effects Covid.

I sure fuck putting sons school foreseeable future. good slowing down, past 7 days Florida new cases per capita every state. still good situation That‚Äôs exactly true given constitution came articles confederation, document gave states much freedom! So, even founding father recognized limits...modern America? much. Bruh get tribals regions limited access education common sense many truther Americans... Theres difference letting kids go letting go large event. recently ex-teenager, kids telling parents they're seeing friends saying they're going massive party.
Thats something kids even without pandemic going lmao.

I agree though, parent knowingly letting kid attend massive parties holds blame. point equally kids fault going, well everyone else attends allows friends/family to.  Well, attempting deceive people... tell me.

Lol. Indeed. honestly think can‚Äôt accept reality  make point without comparing something racist. virus infects organism, targets cells sends instructions making copies virus protein factories inside cells. Someone gets infected immediately shedding enough viral particles transmit disease. 

It takes time (like 2-5 days) virus begin replicating large enough numbers person actually infectious transmit disease others. ‚Äúshow‚Äù schools taking temps every morning. desegregation forced south people means took children public schools instead giving black kids decent educations gave anyone couldn‚Äôt afford private school shit education. There's definitely valid issues sides plus many even mention. win. also intentionally transferred bodily fluids child. Get sex offender registry. Even it‚Äôs stretch. Yeah I‚Äôm going objectively say fever isn‚Äôt side effect rules vaccine candidate Agreed, SNL really upping game lately! /r/FloridaMan No... Lemon Pledge. Whether we're dumb point comment. point reaction would different way around. story short, seems children transfer virus others nearly easily one would expect, article recommends teachers use PPE distancing protect students - really need much protection other. totally agree. low population density. saying population density doesn‚Äôt matter much urbanization rates. could stuff everybody Texas city limits Texas Texas would still population density gave everyone equal-sized plot land, would mean different things discussing spread viruses. Urbanization important, population density.

Yes, USA Canada similar urbanization rates, don‚Äôt take word it. Correction Canada 1.1 percent lower America, one ranking away rank countries urbanization agree, simply enough info. course bulk replies parents distressed distance learning felt need share immediately. people wanting ""wait see"" info hesitant participate.

The downside, course, districts needing make decisions resources. teachers need time plan adapt. also understand, myself, wanting make decisions feel prepared.

I think us playing numbers games best can. describe, figuring cut exposure much possible without way might bring dangerous consequences. Everyone's lines going map that, we're going best.   Plot twist employer nothing happen Exactly. hate people sides argument completely dismiss other. is.

I‚Äôm Canada, seem managing somewhat better. small business, wife‚Äôs work unaffected. Business actually great me; I‚Äôve tried put something back can, consider fortunate. 

You probably ignore comment; you‚Äôve clarified bit made redundant. :) Give another week til near 6-6.5 mill cases... meaning 1 every 50 people pass by/know they‚Äôre educated dead life they‚Äôre alive dumb could president United States ass ""virtue signalling"" 

People keep using term, dont think means think means. Could contained virus. Instead, state chose prolonged increased death sustained economic damage. Congrats. Make bad things happen them. worry this. think Millenials Gen Z - group - largely hopeless. 

Meaning lack hope, hope them. think lack sense optimism what's handed them. boomers Gen Xers giving huge steaming pile problems, top complaining stupid entitled are. 

I wish God every day young people today able fix shithole country that's left them. terrible burden, hate way. worry much what's left behind kids.

I blame anyone Gen Z saying ""fuck this, clean mess, let burn"". Good thing wasn‚Äôt point then. Florida man vs Jersey Drivers man = competition, I'd rather idiot can't drive idiot infecting people. fear losing jobs, they'll make kids same. Kids middle &amp; high school age could stay home fine. many parents force kids school KNOW sick. OB office hospital, despite ""protocols"" still came across 3 nurses masks dangling ears tucked chin. (And last week, medical office filled pregnant women, within hospital.) trust single damn person planet. pull stats ass. deaths nationally 23rd.

288k recorded infections Proof? virus airborne

Airborne transmission respiratory droplet transmission. matter scale, transmission droplets means there's limit far spread. Gravity pulls droplets ground. airborne transmission stay suspended air spread stay air longer time. would also mean masks limited use, air would slip open gap mask user. Similarly air would also leave mask gap user coughing breathing.

There evidence (and much) pointed direction could airborne transmission well, moved further. airborne (which would incredibly strange since similar disease is) spread Covid-19 would way different seen ...people long hair touch hair...

Yes, one reasons important actually 100% know works. Socially distance wash hands. go around touch everything, cover mouth cough. stay home **any** symptom connected Corona.

This might Sweden deviates American ""strategy"". robust welfare system allows us stay home without risking jobs symptoms. Maybe we're trying put band-aid pandemic hope enough, ability social distancing nazis

Maybe discussion Covid-19 without bringing Nazis it? idea trying say link Holocaust. see connection. Today Tuesday tested last Monday 8 days ago. made appointment project baseline testing appointment available day. Although everything I‚Äôm supposed to, fatigue GI issues figured test could get appointment. Anyway, I‚Äôm still waiting results. severely naive flat stupid think people going want keep social distancing vaccines available. We‚Äôre hard enough time virus rampaging across country. Semi permanent tattoos mark medical treatment? Inside left wrist maybe? Yep. husband got test done last Tuesday Sac Co, still results. Truly, highest I've ever heard here! handy, pretty sure Carnival Cruise lines, said majority people went cruises 2019 28-34 (ish).

I imagine varies greatly cruise line cruise line. Depends volume ventilation. Something huge like Costco different ballgame little 7-11  lot people assumed worst, unfortunately people charge anything virus, ones assume best. They've reluctant err side caution ever since start, causing whole country always steps behind.

Close borders? Naahhh...And hey there's evidence community transmission...until was, reason wear masks, was, evidence could airborne, still debated, policy brought around that? yet. kids die flu? allowed schools continue run knowing risk exists?? kids died car way school? Another risk MUCH higher covid death. stopped kids riding cars?? Come on! Death part life. learn live risk living life fullest fucking worth it! part understand people even bothering squabble it. open schools, kids even teachers, school staff, family members home die. don't, many kids completely lose year education, die abuse, hunger, parents lose jobs, etc. win.  options shit. ""Public health experts say problem compounded confusing inconsistent guidance politicians patchwork quilt approaches containing scourge county, state federal governments.""


And here's numbers different US... selfish people everywhere, US behaviour ruling class encourages them... We've even seen news sheriffs saying apply law (when any...) bc believe pandemic...


So... are... read one third nation estimated either currently it. Really hard find source wish took note. either way reason virus thrives. one cares mean, last week weekly update reported deaths included 20 reports May June someone √ñsterg√∂tland obviously went holiday region reported deaths since right midsummer. #Sweden :D Depends are. Hold on, surprisedpikachuface.jpg around somewhere. possible recover kinds brain lung damage seen studies? likely virus, I'm young fairly healthy. studies always seem mention even mild asymptomatic cases show evidence long term damage.

First all, confirm actually virus. Secondly, even virus, vast majority cases relatively mild. evidence effects covid even asymptomatic people, likely recover better since say young person.  We‚Äôve careful since shit hit fan March. anti-maskers/social distancing fatigued morons get spotlight, part people wearing masks inside stores, street crowded areas Brooklyn. We‚Äôve normalized wearing masks (for part) we‚Äôre sick fucking virus don‚Äôt want see spike. What‚Äôs agenda lol think point still stands. principal reason changing mind Trump Coronavirus, think processing do. billed another $39.00 cancelling membership today! entire premise article Sweden better neighbors comparable countries. 

Which argument already lied, norm science deniers. 

What lie position rooted evidence, ever attempt intellectually consistent.

Lol, neat way dismiss opinion already hold. amusing think arbiter science fail intro environmental chemistry class without doubt. mind sharing live? see mention specific strain. link seems gone article. Why!?

Georgia's death reporting worst country. bigger delay states days basically nobody dies. Last Monday 3 deaths too. point I'm sure incompetence data manipulation. Florida closed test sites storm, that's cases low. Arizona appalling day testing, ~9k Ducemaster wanted 35k August 1. AZ's testing downward trend weeks. fact country testing less since 24th July. I'm facebook use it, thanks info. stand corrected. 1st all, 1% awful lot. worse responders catastophically bad (USA, Brasil)...

I'm thinking find way make decoration, maybe scratching completely looks purposeful I've already caught lying repeatedly. one believes you. feel sorry children I'm sure they'll hate too. Can't believe send babysitter. course 99% schools closed rn. literally said babysitting important function government. Trolls can't ever keep gaslighting Looking daily counts day exercise futility. Weekends mondays always slow days. Watch 7-day rolling average instead. Notice even though ""prior arrests prohibit owning firearm"" mentioned couple times stress custody battle covid lockdown, mentions previously arrested for.

Strange know entire criminal background every black man killed officers, matter small may be, never family background account ""stressers"".

Just saying.  dem Lauriers. Wow, holy shit massive difference 

I sorry reacting way, mean hit nerve you. never said study ""positive"". said wrong saying ""negative"". stand that. best botched study enough sample set conclude either way, failed statistics look numbers draw ""negative"" conclusion.

I really understand thought ""handout"". pay taxes part *because* government provide aid event crisis. I've paying life. refusing job. editorialize headline? Yeah, me. didn‚Äôt blame China hard enough. Trump getting though worries think means bail 8,000 paid 10% bond agency? Seems fair enough deemed threat judge.

She's good person high b4il also messed up. friend mine charged intent d1stribute (one 0unce w3ed car) spent time hold waiting tri4l would accepted guilt. Since medical DD wanted fight charge. gave $250,000 bail charge would give bond company 25k. stayed (the place) since one family could get kind money loan it. beaten, nearly r*ped, lasting ptsd experience.

You also get bond percent back matter happens guilty innocent.

I agree woman probably higher bond overall I'm favor ref0rm doubt she'll skip bail this.

Last attempt post this. know p0st others left alone. poorly? great student. kids. They‚Äôre back school you‚Äôll shocked I‚Äôm sure learn remain among living teachers grandparents. Limited education?

That's said per capita. population much smaller 1968. everyone callous irresponsible closing schools then? course not. We're driven sheer hysteria right now. virus real dangerous (most) normal flu strains, still fatality rate 0.5%, deaths highly concentrated among already old sick. reasonable debate whether risk groups worth destroying many people's livelihoods, causing knows many mental physical health problems consequence lockdown, stunting childrens' education. course one wants see anyone die, cared would stay bedrooms day every day.  thought enough ventilators states?

Don‚Äôt buy school supplies stuff regardless? Maybe he's fan low budget caltrops? one thing, false positive rate many antibody tests huge problem. 

The PCR test, knowledge, give false positive results, does, exceedingly rare. 

Let's say antibody test 99% specificity rate. means 1% false positive (this due fact people antibodies coronaviruses whatever crossreact antigen used testing). 

It sounds good paper, say entire country gets tested (we'll say ~330 million tests). Right there, going get 3.3 MILLION positive test results, idea ones legit ones false. use test people, still get useful information population level, individual level, can't use diagnostic. 

But we're using ONE antibody test. We're using different tests different specificities/sensitivities. can't pool data assume positives true. 

But anyway, plenty antibody studies done, good ones include confirmatory tests following initial screening tests. agree data tracked pooled point time studied, currently antibody tests useful tracking active infections PCR test. wealthy upstate new york woman gives coronavirus target employee, target employee dies ant-infested covid overflow tent wealthy woman receives premium care Check /r/COVID19positive 3ft+ away people outdoor means chances getting slim none.

Really frustrating incredibly insightful. countries pay students attend college. Cuba, Denmark, Germany varying degrees. several countries, too, three particular serve great examples.

 Denmark, Cuba Germany low cost tuition pay tax dollars certainly pay student attend university. even know could make shit think would pass truth. 

Again basing argument system exist work US. would pay professors one paid tuition, would able run schools would need exist educate students america? really think economically feasible idea pay every student, janitor, professor, administrator etc. thousands college across country zero value created? reason could make free college work covering paying teachers staff, paying students well absolutely ludicrous frankly stupid. 

 **You actively saying prefer live society dumber doctors, dumber citizens, insurmountable student debt. Buddy, I'm one sounding like idiot.**

This makes sense, paying people go school would make smarter doctors? think epidemic thousands brain surgeon-caliber citizens running around low wage hourly jobs afford college, thousands undeserving people positions? beyond college costs certainly issue, PAYING everyone go college ridiculous. 

Explain think would economically, explain would decide gets paid what-do go community college make much Harvard students? medical school make much communication students? Exactly. say exactly consequences practically every viral infection known man. referencing article read believe rhino horn TCM is, many outdated destructive practices also offer helpful effects person's health.

Not say wisdom TCM.

That said article bereft specifics. going take lot longer distribute it. Implying bad decision someone live life definitely blaming them. That's like asking wheelchair-bound person got hit car crossing street outside trying cross street compromised mobility. greater risk them? Sure, asking questions implications definitely victim-blaming impressive Sweden get away practically nothing still far successful USA. guess takes actual functional healthcare, social system education. 

it's still hard way out, way out. never going end. Feels like we‚Äôre quarantining nothing Precovid, company unlimited sick leave policy illness lasts 5 days apply short term disability, provided company.

It's rarely, ever abused. Treat people right people productive. Fomsgaard Statens Serum Institut among who, together researchers Aalborg University, developed viral genetic tool still shows 80 percent infected Danish variation body. last 20 percent affected various European species one sitting queue while. 

So nothing. illustrate: 20% chance dying left house today, ppl would stay home! majority. UNLESS 'Danish strain' also found Southern Sweden, border areas Germany. mean former Danish territories all. 

I personally think *quite* coincidence cases started spiking exactly two weeks borders reopened Kronoberg Bleckinge. People border regions come day trips, often go drinking, shopping, restaurants, etc.

Public health advise ""health advise"". good society necessarily good you. 

I think opening schools vein saying masks help preserve PPE healthcare workers. believe day care function school serves United States worth cost infection society large.

I disagree hope reason prevail. People think forgetting social distancing comes first else. 

‚ÄúIf wear mask chin sometimes put holes face protected virus‚Äù 

A cloth mask doesn‚Äôt mean shit inches person extended periods time. show YouTube videos. two want actually come here. Especially rn. Jr grandma. describing skilled nursing facilities. share facilities nursing homes, patients usually separate wards.

Acting state local level virus spreads aggressively going cause outbreaks bounce around endlessly country. control borders states like nation, state control get outbreak state time. may worked early handful cases moved fast enough, rates infection climbing rapidly. death rate New York New Jersey 5x anti-intellectual southern states?

Can't government print money money stay inside? whole trust people, general, far less American response whole mess. wash hands put away groceries.

You summed Mississippi perfectly 5 words. Well done. I'm sure even one shared surface incident reported contact clean surface easily, sure, go it. washing hands cheap easy. someone feels like wiping packages, well, can't prove ever help.

But distracting attention away improving ventilation, much. Urban areas South fine imo. know lots very, smart people Atlanta. even that's painting broad elitist strokes.

One famous anti-mask/anti-shutdown rallies Michigan ffs. ""The South"" makes sexier headline people want pat born here. us fortunate enough get decent education best improve things around here. certainly hope are. Sounds like rougher part South am.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs problem face public health over: things right, everything looks normal. lack illness death tells us bother compliance, it‚Äôs it‚Äôs biting us ass see things differently retrospect. 

I don‚Äôt believe schools reopen, isn‚Äôt possible open safely, would require schools remain 100% compliant low infection rates stay low. change topple tower cards. That‚Äôs big bet money lives line. taste like real stuff though Doh, right gave props mask mandate ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol. reddit on?! CDC lot great data sets.

Covid increases chance death last 2 months 4%.

Look, conspiracy theorist. working make money requires money. need go far. head rural Oregon. Actually, unless white. Here's shit gets real slippery slope, can't think single reasonable solution anti-masker problem, think least dozen solutions find unreasonable distasteful concept anti-maskers themselves.

But, could never stand let happen them. yet perfectly willing stand watch die.

If said loud ""group anti-maskers together let them... infect other"" people would call monster. yet, effect that's exactly rest us without batting eyelash.

Slavery forcing inmates work little pay. agree problem, nonviolent crimes makes sense offer bail released early. still committed crime community thus pay community back privilege leave early.

Edit: could list page symptoms problems I‚Äôve experienced. I‚Äôll take people know they‚Äôre talking you. Even researchers scientists saying pace vaccine end year. don‚Äôt need Phase III trials complete know enough start distributing it. enough data, happen early October-ish, they‚Äôll release data governments able start distributing it. 


Now widespread availability? That‚Äôs reason unknown. Already made mind then, see. First, can't believe family grifters propping shell ""man"" grift American taxpayer, know it, Congress nothing. 

Second, can't believe American Corporate Media treat Mad King Orange like king dementia-suffering mob boss. risks could possibly greater dying, bringing virus home parents? Even nickname simply dumb. Luckily, Catholic schools cheap enough option most.

Oh wait, absolutely nothing, trying change subject clearly wrong. Go away let grown ups talk. Hot take- Socioeconomic issue combined slightly cramped work environment allow virus thrive

Fixed title-
No one really knows coronavirus thrives well poverty stricken areas. three theories

Just spoke one friends works similar situation can't stop working simply can't afford to. 

Dog eat dog world. many people like this? live Bumfuck Kentucky doesn‚Äôt mean do. sure site fact ‚ÄúThis number likely increase due 16 DAY REPORTING DELAY due incomplete data.‚Äù Emphasis mine. grew CA moved 30s. It‚Äôs amazing different is, although differences good. one isn‚Äôt course it‚Äôs going get people killed. almost like even social distance kids still KIDS respect rules

I'm saying wrong (because obviously right) wanted add: let's pretend kids can't social distance shit like following rules. Millennials? wasn‚Äôt taken list. Moderate severe asthma still CDC website high risk factor. 
The aftermath virus honestly scary know little it. brother young, healthy, risk anyway shape form- tested positive April sick weeks. said never felt worse life honestly believed going die nights. thankfully testing negative diagnosed post covid syndrome. listed myriad symptoms honestly can‚Äôt remember said hernia, inflammation lungs, inflammation heart, pseudo asthmatic condition (again can‚Äôt remember everything else said). 
Did get similar diagnosis since mild asthma acting up? Coronafreude! really, think deriving joy sickness enemy still counts good old fashioned Schadenfreude. Here‚Äôs crazy idea.. take children families cages detention centers replace anti maskers. Leave pandemic conditions kids families well. Problem solved. letting employees show up, already giving false information safe show up. Catching positives makes information slightly less false.

Giving people false information bad thing change behavior worse, they're already showing work. get worse that, get better. Put diluted bleach bottle. infuriating well could pull together back everything's clusterfuck. almost like leadership top bunch self-righteous, troglodyte assholes care lobbyists. 9-year-old Kimora Lynum (Florida) 's parents said underlying conditions :(

Edited add although looks overweight pictures face, look overweight photos posted obituary saw recent Trump HBO interview explained US deaths proportion cases actually bad, US deaths proportion population really bad. curious discrepancy statistics? understand many cases younger people large number asymptomatic people survive, also reflected population statistic? younger people getting tested thus younger cases? USA fucked No, evidences pointing originate Wuhan, evidence virus already spreading December places like Italy Spain. mean weather came part China. fact evidence pointing away assumption ""it started wet market Wuhan"" exactly research required, here.

Are opposed research then? kind agree complaint. like rest us players medical info given everyone unless completely unavoidable (like explaining player game). NFL long history leaking things like reporters.

But exactly elicit shared Instagram post experienced hostility grocery store, kids ‚Äúharassed kicked playground,‚Äù forced wait car pick food, people close take tests go back work. 

The kids playground positive test back, even trying go grocery store asked wait car totally reasonable, yes, anyone contact someone that's received positive test quarantining given information public reasonable places want come back negative test long quarantine. imagine someone going hospital think COVID, actually flu, pick COVID hospital plus infecting COVID patients flu? need wait till end year really review excess deatgs. instance UK huge number excess deatgs, past month two excess deaths negative. 

Likely due harvesting effect COVID predominantly kills elderly underlying conditions, whike tragic would surprising learn alot people would likely passed year anyway.

All focus minimising cases now, plenty time next year review true count vaccine rolled pandemic halted entitled brat. someone tests positive, isolate. kids playground. store. People test positive trigger others around get tested. None lasting issues, covid kill.

If ploy get sympathy, sadly mistaken play out. Right live Boston (we like 8 universities) convince college educated friends still thing. Dumb southerners stereotype classist gives white supremacist politicians room say ""see elite think dumb"" Alright, know popular question honest feeling I'd like discuss it:

When start holding teachers accountable going schools reopened global pandemic? teachers there, students anyone educate there's school open. 

The buck stop somewhere. stop President, Governor, School Board, School students. means teachers last line defense keeping students community safe. horrible come we're now. know, feel current administration much mindset move without plan vaccine gets OK'd FDA, not, oh well. clear national plan right reopen get semblance functioning economy; right thing do, real thing Trump going covid, good economy (or good least). see change policy, one sheer selfishness one national unity combat highly transmittable disease ruining life know, I'm ears.

EDIT: remember, administration like living memory...never would thought I'd live country president administration would hold national testing plan feel Democrat states gonna bear brunt pandemic therefore would switch states governors seat blue red. mean holy shit, let sink in! Like going doctors told ""no, Democrat, test Republicans, sorry."" can't believe it. yeah, I'm confident administration unlikely national plan even vaccine. grow here, maybe it‚Äôs surprising me. smart friends college degrees.

Baptist cracked first heard conspiracy. Like ""Bill Gates want put micro-chip you"" come from? feels like late 90's conspiracy theory. Don‚Äôt jinx it... yes

Fixing education requires first fix larger societal issues. Looks like rooster pecked chick. Soap water mostly wash virus, disinfectant kills it. guess depends much soap water going use, exactly doing. 

For disinfecting grocery cart something, soapy rag going wash much. I'd rather nuke spray generous rubdown sanitizer. 

For something physically wash like dish household object, yeah, soap water would way go. 

For hands, soap water absolutely better sanitizer, still need sanitizer access sink. lot families need 2 paychecks coming survive. Lots employees fortunate enough able work home. Take sanctimonious parenting open eyes reality around you. Right He's definitely Republicans huge favour then.  virus wasn‚Äôt controlled.
sending kids back school death sentence. im teacher assistant working special needs students found meeting teacher child school contracted virus.

i‚Äôd rather see kids behind bit studies dead super spreaders. Terrible analysis there. I'm following guidelines set scientists, politicians are. What‚Äôs obsession turning every promising development negative? What‚Äôs point? every single development make treating Covid there‚Äôs going way it‚Äôs totally perfect. That‚Äôs reality medicine. 

You could least make actual scientific rebuttal instead casually dismissing substantial amount work may save many lives. opposed vaguely referencing ‚Äòstudies there‚Äô clearly don‚Äôt understand level detail whatsoever. need shut No. much money goes third party companies designed soak tax payer money frame argument around death sentence students. Wait what's big deal? though masks needed? case /s Complaining others reporting you? live glass houses throw stones There's certainly waste that's it. big problem money salary, mean, that's part generally none people mentioned overpaid, rather probably little much support staff necessary.

But bigger issue education spending things like haviing buy things approved vendors, jack price (necessary many people funneled money friends kickbacks), ""new"" initiatives ineffective, unrealistic, lame, promise silver bullet ""fix"" education. Yes Kagan, Kilgo, data driven learning, etc, I'm taking fuckers. 

These programs cost millions promise dog pony show public something teachers incompetent actually teach content meaningful way say look though trying. 

Couple 'silver bullet' strategies never work change year year things schools little directly education. following things district provides community:

1.	Free breakfast students 
2.	free lunch qualifying students 
3.	free school dinner anyone community 
4.	free/reduced clinical medical care registered child family including dental, dietary, mental health care (BAO) Family Nurse Practitioner.
5.	free daycare school hours students staff.
6.	Wellness checks families 
7.	housing assistance homeless poor families 
8.	counseling assistance help put students families touch professional therapist throughout city reduced zero cost.
9.	theres laundry room students access machine leave uniforms get cleaned overnovernight.
10. free use laptops free hotspots families without reliable internet access.
11. district shut summer meal program due covid, last week sent call reimburse families 500 dollars free meals missed summer.
12. reminds me, free summer meal program 


I know there's things directly involved education I'm forgetting right now. point is, schools tasked providing food security, housing assistance, free childcare, internet access, basic medical care etc community. forced state failed build adequate safety net. really want fix education system going take lot money people willing spend, unless understand big picture connected even realize programs support education. 

To clear, taking food security, schools even tasked feeding students, kids walking hungry begin with. That's say get rid school cafeterias, eliminate need schools institute keeps people going hungry first place.

Cheap/Free Universal Health Care. school clinic, even FNP substitute real ongoing medical care doctor. Including mental health drug addiction healthcare. free drug care available parents/students addicted drugs go long way improving school performance.

Adequate housing. I'have students get evicted, living shelters escape abuse, living park mother's paranoid schizophrenia danger children. None kids learned showed school despite best efforts every person school (That's exactly true, girl living park accomplished student ever had, still struggled obvious reasons, rare person overcome struggles).

Job training parents kids. really simple, want kids better school, raise socio-economic status family. statistics sources I'm going go digging right night. point is, Fixing structural problems within society prerequisite fixing education. two inextricably linked point asking school system fix social problems. schools, teachers try best minimize effects larger societal problems, evidenced list gave, drives price education, putting responsibility onto school system giving impossible task. fair blame education system manifestation larger societal problems. messy pain ass

I raised using Comet powder clean everything. 30 seconds scrub sink clean, 5 minutes rinse it, another minutes wipe water splashed onto walls, floors nearby counters. Soap water great flat surfaces. even worse things like light switches, door knobs, drawer cabinet handles high touch surfaces.

My preference spray cleaner microfiber wipes. really scrub need to, everything wipes away dry without grit. toss wipes small basket laundry room run machine supply clean ones gets low. Ok activities associated going beach see distinction matters. Honestly, known nothing changed Sandy Hook. ""They didn't"". Ya man totally I'm sure agree here. vast majority country business opening schools right now, lower end case numbers right now. Maybe hold back Boston surrounding counties bit higher case levels state average, really think counties lower level exactly try reopen schools.  Maybe we... ""Make America Great Again."" blaming problems foreign countries (still understand one blames capitalists system digress), investing resources citizens. Let's spend tax dollars help make us stronger nation opposed wasting inflated military budget. school system given 100 millions years back, took online education properly, oh dear. welcome read comment history. post lot countries. I've conversation several days Danes better university structure, example, Cuba's health care model incredibly effective preventative care. 

Me posting US constitute narrow minded thinking. that's hacked research data future vaccines! Well media controlled corporations controls government... Even virus somehow eliminated human population, could keep circulating animals‚Äîand spread humans again. 

Fuck man. COVID something we‚Äôre deal rest lives. Wow heard that, look up. feet new CDC guideline issued week ago schools. Sounds like prayed [Direct link Oh please tell us properly handle global pandemic wise one. I'm sure tons knowledge experience share us. Serious question. test people returning after? disagree: everyone takes care themselves, everyone taken care of.

Disagree. pandemic make decisions everyone come proximity. 

If let get sick die. see point education, healthcare. terms housing food think it‚Äôs pretty clear markets usually better modes organization. I‚Äôm sure system want compare markets too, even quasi socialist countries like Norway, Denmark something, housing still provided market. Also market room government intervention behalf people need it. say never failures, people societies well functioning markets tend wealthier board. wealth != happiness, without wealth much harder time happy. alive matter. reasoning? 

No, state ~~because~~ millions cases ~~few~~ ***zero near zero*** reported cases reinfection, ~~it's highly unlikely reinfections factor.~~ There's premise conclusion, sounds like reasoning me. 

It observation. millions cases COVID19 ranging November 2019 (maybe even sooner), thus far @ 15 cases potential re-infection, half within 3 months. 

It factor. Yep So, summation, people's opinions assumptions really matter..... Unless course, like Americans, important decisions made based opinions assumptions goes ways. thinking 1st degree connections. 2nd degree connections certainly part social network. might recognize public, introduced friend's house instantly know ""connect"" them. quoted definition also include ""interaction"" requirement cited previously. ""connected interpersonal relationships"". that, definitely connected 2nd degree contacts. relationship friend, relationship family. 

At point, however, referring ""English"" issue much pedantic. Worries. good die young. normalcy bias anyone? observations conspiracy theories spread like wildfire lot workplaces like warehouses, construction, trucking. Believing crazy ideas seems necessary part brotherhood workplace. man respectful women tries use reason man eyes coworkers. Well that's indeed positive view hope developed countries bring helpful innovations. Indeed, countries precarious research, impossible own. hope situation control New Year :)

By way, intention make feel bad, maybe gave much rant :S Indeed people developed countries better position, within unequal latin american societies, there's also disparity. example circle privileged able work home, afford attention private clinics. Wealthier people affected too, friends tragically, situation people go work, travel crowded buses terrible state medical attention option (even pandemic hospitals full) dramatic.

To end, want emphasize although situation bad, really like apocalypse (at least yet). One usually feel like dog drinking coffee surrounded flames meme, since heard stories dead, personally met tragedy. life go like usual (quarantined, course), fact months ago celebrated birthday mother, happy all, also video meetings play online games friends, fun, despite friends mourning. bizarre indeed. That's emphasize ""and yet life goes on"" end.

Anyway take care stay whatever keep virus bay, swede friend :) Thanks heads up, know made both. Mine is:

Here's rub: parents work impossible work play teacher time. situation need send kids somewhere (spring almost disaster). mingling kids becomes conversation centered around risk management rather 'stay home' vs 'go back school'. case, they're either going school daycare help remote learning (have decide Friday) - staying home simply option. 

Shitty choice, sure. Wow...because it‚Äôs possible cancel taxes....comparing apples oranges (as pears), highly successful argumentative tactic/s worth life....No job worth dying for. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Goodbye Georgia, wallow ilk. totally understand that. know social interactions critical young people like you.

She's first last. pretty high number, thought declining Texas? forget: company's rmr monopoly destroyed physician morale destroyed possibility efficient technology use modern healthcare. tried walmart.com? say flu kills people. literally said ""Coronavirus kills people"". death rate children however higher flu coronavirus. controversial. well documented. See example \- estimated death rate US 2017-2018 flu 1% children aged 5-17. pointed here: ""children adolescents 18 years old account 7 percent COVID-19 cases less 0.1 percent COVID-19-related deaths"". quote used article nurse. literally thing.

No, don't. ~30M people still uninsured country, gotten even worse Trump. See: surveys indicate number uninsured fell 2013-2016 due expanded Medicaid eligibility health insurance exchanges established due Patient Protection Affordable Care Act, also known ""ACA"" ""Obamacare"". According United States Census Bureau, 2012 45.6 million people US (14.8% under-65 population) without health insurance. Following implementation major ACA provisions 2013, figure fell 18.3 million 40%, 27.3 million 2016 8.6% under-65 improvement coverage began reverse President Trump. Census Bureau reported number uninsured persons rose 27.3 million 2016 28.0 million 2017 28.6 million 2018.

And recent economic downturn due COVID, even people likely currently uninsured. Fyi I‚Äôm one downvoted you. case care sort thing.

So think modeling surrounding covid-19 disastrous. they‚Äôve wrong also they‚Äôve driven public policy media coverage. IHME model one point 76,000 deaths Aug 1 high end Sweden (vs ~5,500 actual). triggered lots idiotic hysteria non-expert press. Yay, irrational shrieking made smarter covid-19 policy. Thanks

I don‚Äôt think confidently predict relationship various measures you‚Äôve spelled rate spread. Correlation isn‚Äôt causation, countries widely different approaches ended place.

I‚Äôd also suggest lockdowns (truly policy hate fire ten thousand suns) aren‚Äôt cost-free. also never said nothing protect vulnerable. 

I simply don‚Äôt think destroy lives literally countless numbers people ages countless ways order *maybe* extend lives 85 year olds comorbidities matter months. quality life adjusted years concept reason. Also note even vast majority elderly people survive dreaded airborne plague known covid-19.

Preventing kids continuing school, condemning millions famine developing world, wrecking lives people 60 points careers delaying ‚Äúnon-elective‚Äù cancer treatments beds remain empty covid patients never come (a consequence üóë modeling) costs. question stupidity, moral virtue.

Once collective mental illness finally passes, academic papers intended unintended consequences lockdown SCATHING imo. They‚Äôll probably conclude temporarily lost fucking minds. Economists social psychologists probably much say epidemiologists. Unemployment thing Quit course. new job *College Cruisin‚Äô* reality tv star. Come on, keep plan!

Ok kidding aside, yeah, that‚Äôs real issue figure out. would regular cruise ship jobs fill though. mean there‚Äôs laundromat someone manage laundry right? kitchens bars shops that? Sure stuff would repurposed classrooms, need leisure entertainment everyone stuck board whole semester.

It‚Äôs ideal everyone course, I‚Äôm also imagining actual cruise ship college that‚Äôs planned students work cruise ship jobs extra curricular clubs run entertainment (like comedy shows whatever you‚Äôd normally find cruises), lead fitness classes plan meals etc etc etc, like real cruise ship, also take normal college classes.

I fun little vision. It‚Äôs means well thought out. investor cruise ship maybe I‚Äôd think little harder. amazing Souths outbreak result anti intellectualism larger outbreaks NYC California somehow caused something completely different. 

We dont really great idea outbreaks big, best correlation far outdoor inhibiting weather, like freezing cold springs East Coast Midwest, well brutally hot southern summers. find unlikely caused anti intellectualism NYC California outliers. remember reading article MBA professor manufacturing/distribution talked key execs cleaners/disinfectant sector, said cost prohibitive ramp production catastrophic event may last 2 years. Additional factories huge investment capital, companies would never able recoup demand dropped back pre-covid levels years. think professor suggested entity like federal government could subsidize build-out facilities meet return investment. saves even one life, useless. point testing create 100% accurate database who's positive isn't, catch many positive people possible get quarantine. Right now, Disney's catching 0 they're making employees show work. can't get worse 0. Find new jobs, u know many people forced work this? Unemployment available months months assist finding new work, given 1200$ going given again!! Stop fucking excuses. wear mask btw, think it‚Äôs stupid too. Swap pro-athlete NFL player specifically, sure, agree you. Average NFL player socioeconomic bracket average teacher.

I see majority teachers declaring bankruptcy 20's 30's (78% NFL players).

I see average teacher fizzling careers 3 years less (avg career NFL lasts 3.3 years).

I **do** see median NFL player makes $3 mil entire career, effectively going effectively taxed twice high teacher making $3 mil 30+ years count jock taxes unavoidable expenses like \~3% agent fees.

I **do** see vast majority players league rookie-scale contract even can't better minimum-wage tier jobs support rest lives.

The disconnect people think guys like OBJ superstars hundreds millions rake career. AVERAGE guy plays NFL may well entirely different profession comes comparing compensation, guess what? assume exact risks peers league make money.

If want mention semantics, address silly we're trying draw class divide average athlete (emphasis average) teachers two overlapping blips spectrum plotted owners/GMs/investors NFL ultimately valuing profit human lives. Make fun OBJ personally one make statement want, make said wrong majority league. Sounds like Dave going haunt fuck people That‚Äôs terrifying. Like NY NJ Good see case numbers continuing decline. second ‚Äúwave‚Äù coming going like first. Still health systems overrun. Still shortage ventilators (remember that?). Still vast majority deaths nursing homes people already verge death. Well look illnesses, otger smallpox, disease eradicated? Even something like polio huge effort put eradicating yet still persists areas.

But big difference virus like covid running wild small pockets virus managed Woah, sell Brazil?! want kids go back school even listen highly educated people. least absolutely correct Republican NJ. know huge outbreak care.  Oh it‚Äôs north too. Texas, stay inside Summer go outside much not-summer  think antibacterial antibacterial? choice. teachers we‚Äôd interactive stuff. That's bad example, seen ""normal"" media report that. covid case Chinese Media quite often. um... darwinish? Nope, logic flawed. stupid see though. guys understand disproportionately effecting blacks, right? countries aren‚Äôt? heard masks mandatory Europe. friend went Amsterdam went bars said everything normal there...

Tions Haha, family probably NA longer his! Traceable history back 1620s, came France. 

Not matters least. I'm you. wearing masks 6 feet away makes zero sense. Say zip gas station pay (without mask) customer. throw cash counter zip out. two people there. People school day multiple people. Whatever class size is, student middle class virus? did. Wtf even arguing? 60% responding parents school district mom teaches opted person schooling. catch **40,000** parents even bother responding **mandatory** survey. fucking clue many kids going show schools day one. assume parents shitty lazy even respond planning home school. mom sent paperwork opt medical reasons idea whether they'll respect choice make retire. meeting school board last night (they voted last week go virtual) parent came make comment saying forcing kids stay home going cause spike teenage suicides blamed school board potentially killing kids. teaching classes since May, Korea kids wear masks day every room windows open keep well ventilated. also daily temp checks sanitizer everywhere kids wash hands lesson. much possible try enforce social distancing, partially successful.

It work everyone including management, students staff take regs seriously mask wearing must 100% compliance.

Even worked hagwons private schools, public schools still operating limited basis. also 3 locally transmitted cases nationally.

For US re-open stage outbreak without tough regs backing teachers dangerous extreme. US different trajectory Sweden right though. Sweden adding 1 2 deaths day, US 500 1000. would awesome, we'd also find way help parents afford stay home. risk students probably working parents can't stay home due nature work (factory, retail, etc.).  odd interview. doc came early said kids great transmitters diseases general largely asymptomatic Covid stealth carriers, don‚Äôt wash hands, don‚Äôt respect social distancing etc. 

But concluded saying he‚Äôs gonna allow daughter go back school generally favor schools opened. 

So, go B.? moment.. 'Murica always want No1 ü•¥ Keep mind that's schools closed.  IIRC, countries show dip weekend, since testing crews need rest, exactly sign stupidity. hand, 'Go To' campaign...that's another level. us introverts starting go little insane too, though, without even littlest dribble social interaction.

Anything contradicts narrative heavily downvoted. everybody disagrees loser peaked high school? hurt you? too, voted admit made mistake. Two flaws logic:

1.	You presume something either *good* *bad*, in-between. reality, possible something neither good bad. [false argument based premise original commenter thinks disparities necessarily *good* thing, cannot assume based information have. possible point example situation leads disparities without framing necessarily good bad. Exactly, starting year virtual makes sense exact reason. School systems turn offer far better virtual learning experience don't. Yes can, it'll get bad 10k daily look like miracle. People still want black Friday, thanksgiving Christmas, going church celebrating new year millions people die.

The rest world also terrible they'll want open Christmas sales best time year retail. Causing mass infections world wide people travelling home visit family. Okay? even mention Ducey. saying order believe AZ cooking numbers, would mean health care officials, workers, executives, hospitals part conspiracy, believable. hospital data truly trending down, someone would blowing whistle accusing state health department fraud. 

You give Ducey credit anything, that's fine. seems city/county mask mandates coupled targeted business closures yielding intended results, people skeptical? things begging implemented implemented expected results seen implementations. get 50% bill go order food eat in.

Everything helps. agree, that‚Äôs actually happened.

Original going Stanford, Harvard, MIT also create disparities kids go community colleges.

Your thinking it‚Äôs actually quite good born poverty creates lifelong obstacles.

These two completely different diametrically opposing views. didn‚Äôt merely ‚Äúrephrase‚Äù original argument, changed something entirely different, grossly misrepresenting it. definition straw man. numbers per capita *still* high... think places studied showed significant surface contact transmission hospitals. Mainly whole bunch coronavirus patients concentrated lots aerosolizing procedures. Everyone sprung balcony cabin probably thankful so. Everyone trapped one small windowless interior rooms probably regrets ever deciding come cruise. issue tend remove humidity air. humidity causes droplets aerosols precipitate air faster. cold winter people tend run humidifier indoors. isn‚Äôt annual flu dunce. education probably fuck more. Also brain damage serious issue seeing mass reporting brain damage coronavirus victims Brazil, Sweden, Belarus country high proportion population [relatively] it? Surely serious common side effect would observed now. Maybe testing limits reached

Just reaching testing limit would convert upward curve downward one. (I think anyone claimed number tests actually still hard time believing change daily cases time 

OTOH, CA started declining seems unlikely CA would fudge numbers Trumps orders. That‚Äôs kinda I‚Äôm at. Or, case town, many people begrudgingly oblige mask mandates work, proudly disregard CDC advice personal lives. know quite healthcare workers dental assistants nursing home aides still believe it‚Äôs hoax, overblown, etc. 

Apparently case spreader, town family staying home. benefits advocating approach? Businesses states lose money working spending.

Who works businesses? aunt thinks there‚Äôs bleach wipes, Clorox brand. didn‚Äôt energy tell wasn‚Äôt show disclaimer container says, ‚ÄúContains bleach.‚Äù

The wipes, like lot disinfectants, promise germ killing surface kept wet four minutes. I‚Äôm sure users don‚Äôt that.

It matter going one crowded parks country state infections plane multiple times year....

They alone hours hiking trail, means socially distances. prostrate imbecile ten-second brain fart Critical thinking taught respect specific domains, general critical thinking proven impossible teach. Oh making decisions would even _attempt_ discuss rationality.

Instead we're counter absurd 'think children' bullshit arguments (Can't school, they'll wither die, can't school they'll kill everyone) barely find room breath around rational points. family member scheduled cruise Christmas week. numbers started dropping dramatically, mid-shutdown, cruise company called told giving $1,000 bar credit, two free massages, room upgrade would *waive cancellation policy cruise*. did. numbers looking good, current administration wasn‚Äôt totally bored yet still looked like might give up. cruise lines literally took opportunity manipulate customers going cruise middle pandemic. blame definitely goes agreeing, apparently ton people. US cruise lines reopen September, going packed full people spent thousands dollars literally can‚Äôt cancel now. thing is...the economic disaster already begun.

Does anyone really think sending kids viral incubator going ***help*** economy? wont, bring virus home cause parents get sick, miss work, able pay bills, get evicted, potentially die.

What worse economy? Kids staying home learning workforce decimated virus already know mitigate staying home? free choice ideally 50% kids stay home, would ease much. Teachers would double shifts, would benefit small classrooms, doubles anyways Adults can't even correctly. grocery store lately? nightmare keeping distance. expect children adhere this? Something tells founders would still comfortable loss life truly centralized federal power. turn tables scientist frequently use ad hominem arguments hardly good scientist. I'm engaging ""who quote Tegnell better"" competition, see nothing substantiates point FHM keeping scientific progress.

If science settled established, eye raising two different agents reach different conclusions based available scientific literature. I'm personally date current reputable scientific knowledge matter, position point major weaknesses publications listed (and address), illustrates point science established try give impression of. would need leader step address nation real problem. source use? 

According WaPo, numbers people dying 1000 last week, weekend fell, normal, Monday also 'only' around 500. 

It's little shady. OP said, still exponentially growing.The White House pushed hard bypass CDC. nations bypassing true numbers. similar event? However, one day outlier. time tell. used subway college decent value proposition keep fed I'm hurry bring lunch day guise ""healthy"" food. course, saying people use it. reminder choice there.  I'm sure there's good repository national antibody/antigen test results. someone link one, let know!

It's difficult sensitivity/specificity different tests varies wildly depending antibody/antigen used, throw results pot data, meaningful. 

And we're clear, antibody/antigen tests tell us different things, need keep separate well. 

A positive antibody test means COVID-19 long enough (and ""bad"" enough) generate immune response. 

A positive antigen test means viral product system CURRENTLY. closer PCR test, susceptible false positives. Agreed problem America needs get real so. hear? couple people got Ebola back then, total sad failure. We're better ever China Virus, super control, nothing ever beautifully strongly controlled, except maybe blood pressure year. find weird people keep insisting Sweden's health authority (and Tegnell particular) say conclusive scientific evidence efficiency benefits using masks public situations coronavirus. Netherlands's RIVM said almost word word :
‚ÄúThere yet sufficient scientific evidence encourage use face masks public spaces. exceptional situations, consideration could given using non-medical masks possible follow general measures, public transport.‚Äù

Andreas Voss, member World Health Organisation expert team head microbiology hospital Nijmegen, said didn‚Äôt personally believe masks made mandatory, stating many countries face mask rule implemented, several measures also place, impossible determine impact masks specifically. 

it almost I've heard exact things said weekly briefings Sweden... European schools reopened didnt ser thousands dead kids teachers It‚Äôs confusing assume opposite whatever official political spin is. know means, instead of... This. even DREAM I'm public wash hands wake up. Keeping safe subconscious level fucking hard morons. Wear damn mask many kids ok dying flu? Americans tolerate this? Well surprised that, one, wasn‚Äôt staff worked patients. 

Still, raises huge concerns considering even said staff wear masks socially distance, even breaks. mask mask transmission possible 6‚Äô away, claim mask open mouth transmission unlikely mere inches they‚Äôre hovering patients? party even power US government got every country world enemy ally alike make one massive conspiracy could win election doctor could make millions companies stake in....? I've staring 5 minutes can't make heads tails saying.

Many afraid ask ""silly questions"" take attitude drunk take attitude toward it? reinstate prohibition. Ban alcohol everyone. drinking protects drinking protects end day, personal risk tolerance. Im wearing mask, afraid drunks either. get it, hit called life.

Me drinking *and driving* protects you. wearing mask protects us well. Either us drinking really effect unless one us decides personal risk tolerance means right get car drunk risk people's lives. right take whatever risks like life.

Take note, redditor use deception exaggeration promote thier agenda.  even die unnecessarily ""The victim mother 10""

Stop fucking breeding!

News report: ""The woman mother 10 adopted children""

Oh... fucking saint. fair peak due increased testing June went (people waiting opportunity tested ""queue"" say) confirmed cases went pre-June levels. Except severe cases medical staff also mild cases (or Stockholm people without symptoms). Look top right figure - yes, summer period, outdoors activity, much travel, people still distancing also holidays. 8 106 recipients required hospitalization? doesn‚Äôt sound promising...

Edit: CNBC reported earlier, Stat News confirmed reported error. Notice retreated playing semantic games. one cares technical difference mortality fatality rates except you. failed make point, resorting this. Try again.

I used phrase ""population fatality rates"" distinguish ""case fatality rates"" ""infection fatality rates."" right actually death rate (which said) morality rate (which say). think jumped wrong conclusion. u/mdhardeman obviously meant case: wedding organizers going responsible lot dead people. 

Thus really innocent, selfish. Every guest goes along madness also cannot considered innocent. 

The distinction: None people need survive. completely voluntary selfish. $2400 taxed federal state. It‚Äôs rent need pay. forgot private healthcare plans, utilities groceries. would thought human knowledge would make people dumb? Www.azdhs.com

From see Arizona‚Äôs Cases, hospitalizations, deaths, etc think people understand much support schools give risk kids. One could argue school place kids receiving services pretty much works right now. food school care therapy tutoring mention special ed kids get education trained professionals also get things like speech therapy, OT, PT. Everyone trying best figure provide risk kids difficult. really wonder many actually honest opinions imminent death many see circle jerking hobby since they're bored. daily numbers US now? Havent seen really easy answers debate. either open schools, almost certainly lead COVID-19 heartbreak. close schools, keep people safer COVID-19 certainly lead significant amount consequences (parents able work cases taking care kid, kids falling behind school, etc).

I personally think schools using zoom possible high risk communities, realize way complex debate topic solved simple yes answer  asked 158,000 dead people screamed back ""who cares?""

yikes shit. easy long, became selfish &amp; tantrum throwing slightest inconvenience... Yeah, better ever interact someone share worldview lest forced see perspective already science-denying lockdown ‚Äúskeptic,‚Äù I‚Äôm going waste time arguing you. can‚Äôt even read article without lying contents.

Lol, doctorate chemistry, I've published research papers read, read papers least factor 50. kids really think skim read something experts. testing capacity underwhelming.

As China‚Äôs, January February.  fun games actually need something done July, realise impossible everyone vacation whole country hold except essential parts reminiscent hydroxychloroquine data came months ago suggesting promise. reality ""data"" barely anecdote concerning handful patients. No. starters, people going want keep social distancing booster shot, least. people also develop robust immune response. people vulnerable even get sick herd immunity achieved- achieved. may enough people willing take vaccine achieve immunity. means elderly immunocompromised may need keep social distancing. 'fairly well' comparing US states.... fucking unmitigated disaster compare anywhere else planet. Chunk population actively rejecting truth due propaganda GOP. pandemic much bigger deal anything else happenned (affected basically every American). 1) ""no one lives there,"" that's definition LOW POPULATION DENSITY. dictionary might help -- recommend Merriam-Webster. 

2) That's even wrong. Canada urbanization United States. mathematically impossible Canada 30 million people entire country (which geographically larger US), whereas USA 330 million. largest city Toronto, population 7-8 million (metro). New York 15-18 million LA 13 million. 

Math friend. Jag √§r s√• rysk man kan bli. J√§tterysk faktiskt. D√§r jag kommer fr√•n s√§ger man Wysk. Ser lite ut kyrilliska.   Yup. people brought US verge another civil war. Well, like dumb alive gone great far. Bit lose lose that. open, feel safe. poor reasoning, state governments best educate public virtually anything outside home puts risk exposure.

Car accidents extremely relevant analogy. We're talking risk/cost analysis. 
 What's risk death typical kid? less 1 100k, that's counting kids comorbidities. Covid less dangerous kids tons things already let do. said ""no children cars traveling 15 miles per hour unless emergency"" we'd save hundreds lives year. risk death, real, incredibly small. Little Skylar got bad roll dice. Like kid could backyard pool riding bicycle. What‚Äôs wrong Florida? hear awful stories everyday. organizer party probably knows lot more. 1k people actually showed rather giving false promise, happens lot kind scenarios. live FLA, different idea America looks like. assure every American Florida man every country version Florida man. There's also ""hopefully soon"", ""no idea, holding up?"" host others would less dumb. That's false dichotomy. thought guys left EU?  I'll add two:

-Elevators feel really messed up. Even they're empty first, got off? stops let others on? Stairs healthier anyway.

-Beards; shaved mine get mask seal properly. They're bug traps now.

Edit add #3: 

-No shoes house. Japanese something there. Nah, south really dumb. guys got cheap houses least. Masks worn millions, large cities (which really counts) achieved high levels mask compliance. We've issued 53 million tests U.S. caught 5 million positive cases.

Could done more? course. could always more. look entire cost do. doctorate Harry Potter World doctorate Star Wars Universe valid Christian theology ... also parents CARE. I'm teacher pre-Covid, plenty unemployed parents bother pick kids ""liked quiet time.""

I used always blame systemic problems, people also kids. Yeah making sense haha virus suddenly become likely kill children?

(If I'm supposed say this, moderators please DM me) words stupid? sitting back popcorn waiting ‚ÄúI told so‚Äù happen. Australia tried failure. private schools Atlanta saying ‚Äúmasks optional‚Äù imagine kid..yeah mom got mask on..5 seconds entering school it‚Äôs around neck. Poor Matt, imagine quarantined someone would publicly complain shit like this. Smh  amount money people spend weddings absolutely staggering, real waste money ask me.

So judging weddings general, weddings pandemic, statement. 

Big, official gatherings like seen throughout history fundamental human thing. Personally, wedding best day entire life friends family come together make wonderful day. Wedding happen, people gather, matter basement-dwelling neck beard wants. 

All said, big weddings totally inappropriate pandemic. happening NOW. maybe lets focus instead ""The amount money people spend weddings absolutely staggering, real waste money ask me"" nobody asking you. It'll disappear summer, say year! maybe shouldn‚Äôt fucking playground Wow wouldn‚Äôt nice God save them!

Let‚Äôs see clarify since people don‚Äôt seem understand inherent bias data:

One day peaks represent abundance data tangible consequences.

One day troughs represent lack data unknown consequences. 

I handle time series data professionally.

Edit: explaining wife became apparent need point bias data result testing bottleneck‚Äî prolific testing quick turnaround, bias would less prominent. think citing obvious ideological rag media organization met immediate laughter 26th they'll 200 teachers least short term immunity, obviously.

A high (5-10%) percentage cases low-population density area might devastating small community still big enough make non-local news, reporting complicated fact rural hospitals tend operate 'stabilize transfer"" manner serious medical issues. 

Case point, area, local hospital legally classified ""Critical Access Hospital"" - whopping 25 acute care beds, ICU beds, ad-hoc isolation facilities (at best).

So, came COVID needed hospital, Emergency Department would stabilize me, get o2, call ambulance transfer regional hospital either 30 60 miles away (depending availability beds staff facilities). beds available either 2 facilities, minimum 3 hour ride big city, weather conditions permitting.

From reporting perspective, positive COVID test result (and death, appropriate) would counted home zip code / county, stats would aggregated hospital admitted to.

Once average numbers? People rural areas fade background, statistically speaking. I'm bewildered exhausted ever changing unrealistic plans kids school district keeps sending genuinely wish would let people take fucking gap year. hell maybe gap winter.

The wedding takes place New York State, world. active infection rate 0.005% there, *at least*: 

5K active cases detected last 14 days/20M population = 0.025%. Probably twice that, let's ignore now. guest thus 99.975% chance healthy.

Most importantly, small numbers accumulate. chances 0 guests infected 200-person wedding product probabilities one healthy: (0.99975)^200, 95%. 

The remaining 5% *low estimate* cumulative risk least someone infected within 200 guests. Changing NYS overall US statistics guests may come country (120K recently detected cases/330M) makes number slightly worse (6% rather 5%).

It negligible all. half cases detected (total estimated NYS cases = 10,000 estimated US cases = 240,000), cumulative risk goes 10% [NYS] 14% [overall US]. 

Odds transmission similarly high, 200 guests. Chances infect least one substantial enough indoors exposure. can't stay home watch netflix months? rest south (i.e. Georgia) that, ""Thank God Mississippi""/""At least Mississippi"" taste now???

Its toxic suggest he's holocaust denier. That's kind thing person without empathy would say, justify wretched anti-social behavior. testing, relying communication positive tests communication parents (take will). However, upon communication, contact tracing aggressively (89 students quarantined 5 positive results).

Tomorrow might hear automotive industry (funnily enough BYD biggest global manufacturer mask, make mask start year, might count automotive more), day theme parks.

It clear going eradication strategy paying off. What's going happen China keeps recovering US losing 5 years worth GDP growth every quarter? It‚Äôs budget thing. won‚Äôt get federal dollars person, they‚Äôre making sure state doesn‚Äôt make shortfall. really insane handled. That‚Äôs like movie two. one made specific claim. 

Haw federal government manipulating data stream fingers in?

Defend claim without resorting name calling making shit up. what? Sounds like threat, come bro. Lives stake here. many documented tragic cases school in-person openings world, officials still pushing in-person school openings? held accountable inevitable covid cases occur, especially students teachers died? mention communities spread well. Insane illogical. understand conservatives Whatabouting viruses defend Dear Traitor. asking, ""in opinion"" thought tests counted. asking ""their opinion""

I think so! saying PCR reliable one made think agreed one counted.

People trying tell stating something someone else's opinion indicate agree them. 

It seems like know they're saying there's two ""their""s me, asked ""their opinion"", ""their opinion"" weird thing say.

But comments addressed ""their""s (the second ""their"" *your* ""their"" ) 

I think agreeable thing said Maybe misunderstood original comment (AP) ‚Äî Texas board licenses doctors warned physicians could take action anyone falsely advertises cure Texas Medical Board issued warning Houston-area pastor doctor, Dr. Stella Immanuel, publicly touted hydroxychloroquine cure disease caused coronavirus, the¬†Houston Chronicle¬†reported.

/s Try living somewhere else? yet, ya. looks like track keep growing. knows sure. kids old enough stay online schooling.

But governor state threatening arrest/penalize parents refuse sending kids back.

Guess I'm fucking going jail.

I hate state. subreddit turned propaganda real quick. I'm California worse every southern state. worse everybody NY NJ. Neither previous commenter seem actually read article. lose hope, us still social distancing. can't tell we're inside! Last week 19% county signed distance learning. Tomorrow deadline hopefully chose it. least shows us making right choices. enough, some. Unpopular opinion bit aside, seems many people kids next step adulthood, without considering whether something really want.

That said, feel sympathy parents there. can't imagine stress must feel top stress exist healthy adults whose jobs unaffected. layperson could seen type meltdown coming. Jesus fucking Christ. Holy fuck. There‚Äôs question south red longest time. never fault scientists, still makes look bad. ok coronavirus south lol Except Houston, urban hospitals filled we're detouring patients outside city. friend nurse. traveling country every week. husband‚Äôs family got back Alaska multiple members contracted virus. friend group trying talk her, understand justify traveling like many healthcare workers aren‚Äôt even seeing spouses children months. 

Her answer hospital overrun understaffed, undersupplied, nothing properly take care patients even right now. says colleagues complained situation superiors, written local leaders could think of, tried get stories news. nothing. 

So reasoning sacrificing vacations entertainment when, mind, wouldn‚Äôt even make difference. mindset tens millions Americans have. fucked every conceivable way. Depends go/ county in, far slowing results concerned. two friends submit testing days month ago; one got results 3 days (LA county) took like 2 weeks (San Bernardino County). tested hospital work results day. People walking test testing site getting within week. think testing really matters (of course matters, humor me) people like nothing going on. Bars restaurants still full sit people outside? People walking street without mask like people dying. Underground parties still thrown. ridiculous. course, prevention individual level high risk situations individuals, n95 comparable mask true high efficacy preventative measure wearer. public health/social level, widespread mask-wearing (even loose) helps squash infection rates. So, no, people lull thinking 100% protected right thing themselves, point article reply post. socioethical issue individual autonomy vs public safety. evidence masks working way [is kids. everyone kids come contact with. Parents, grandparents, etc. encouraging spread contagion data already indicates in-person learning bad idea hospitals already capacity. "
