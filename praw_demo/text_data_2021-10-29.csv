0,2021-10-29,"  rabies. Yikes. vaccination rate pretty high they’ve recently locked cities cases pop up. take things pretty seriously. Four family got sick covid. test negative. Two hospitalized one severe case. stayed covid ward 40 days covid patients.  wore face mask face shield entire stay room. know didm't get sick. Yea given density India official count shockingly low. Ah, nice. That's surprising! That's draft.

You can't conscientious objector sign up. many would’ve thought beginning pandemic. yea basically one would clue happening 3 4 months doctors would start catch patients random sampling, point late - everyone - enough drugs produced fast enough. within year like 10-20% world population dead. point drugs circulated widely enough avoid total disaster 90%+ die off. religions get exemptions? sacred texts specify masks global pandemic?

Which religions?  exemptions anything want? 

And infect others without penalty beliefs?    That's unvaccinated refuse get shot.   Ad blocker ftw called sounds like they’re waiting till CDC approval. Hopefully next week!  I’m sorry. hope spared pandemic. Yet ""[nationwide non-working set personal decree. Picture loading. fit agenda can't prove came lab. study pretty clearly designed look serious disease. Mild breakthrough cases already well studied means occurs frequently enough natural infection vaccines, winner dependent exact study.

As individuals probably care serious disease good reason previously infected individuals still get vaccine. Probably not, court pretty consistently upheld government’s authority vaccination policies far.

This Mike Liddell level crap. Iowa collect unemployment. WTF? right thing.  get it, I'm really saying you. seem reasonable. (I'm downvoting either)

It pretty serious lab, least safety controls place (yes know, China, like US). markets etc safety controls. going happen lab, going happen outside lab too. asking bad faith questions know answer try clever make point think have.   play devil's advocate second, India like 20 years younger European countries pediatrician told yesterday she’s worried even 3 year old next spring :/. say “just after” there’s never timeline. worry approval they’ll feel even less pressure 2-5 2 intent. 

I think we'll ever know certainty. 

It occurs routine higher-biosafety level labs routinely take freeze researcher blood samples, might aid future forensic analysis possible lab leaks. Eg, November December 2019 samples authorized handle bat samples anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies, would go long way towards clearing Institute. I'm sure every virology lab pretty intense scrutiny moment, sort measure would require lot buy-in many people present overworked usually underpaid skill sets. sure that. know folks work got first 2 shots balk boosters. Almost like buy propaganda initial shots. husband died August find hospital bed. died pancreatitis, hospitals full unvaccinated CoVid patients. Sure, complete govt control exist. interesting theoretical, realistic. There's country earth every citizen honestly believes god-like retribution breaking law. Pope said get it, rules Catholics even relatives jabbed. 

My job offered 50k roubles (about median monthly salary) showed certificate, also vaccinated. 

However, recently told burned bridge someone still anti vaccines stage pandemic  agreeing referring technologies behind vaccine development...  I'm positive late December 2019 right. patronizing. almost certainly know history Cuba me. apologize that. familiar Batista, obviously recognize could never remained power without support US. also believe another ruler capitulated US interests would much better peasants working plantations much worse mobsters running Havana. recognize revolution good thing, least time, ask think went wrong.  lot data showing take different booster vaccine. significant JNJ, case every vaccine. know topic, exactly st louis Missouri gets ranked murder capitol United States meme month two ago: *I trust immune system too! That's gave extremely detailed picture virus, immune system beat moment virus appears.* wouldn’t nearly many obese people smokers things put back line medical treatment. Would probably greatly increase health nation, let’s it! many friends/relatives vaccinated? 

Among circle, people 50-s older vaccinated, rest quite stubborn taking jab. younger generation, vaccinated, however, even among colleagues 20s, people ""won't get vaccinated unless made to"". Ess Eee Ex convinced poll results highly predictive people's actions? lot data shows true.  look? 2 recent agreed. Loosing 3.6% employees within short time frame 

I doubt come that. places reached mandate's deadlines reported less 1% left. military also [has AF may decide bring bear well. That's even biggest caveat. conclusion drawn grand total 413 cases, multiple exclusions candidates present sensitivity analysis exclusions. terrible study. main data this: 
 
“RS-CoV-2 infection identified among 324 (5.1%) 6,328 fully vaccinated persons among 89 1,020 (8.7%) unvaccinated, previously infected persons.” So, unadjusted, unvaccinated 70% likely COVID positive within 2 weeks prior admission. then, “adjusted” this, determined 3% difference saw (over grand total 413 cases, really 5x difference. Adjusting numbers makes sense, already dealing really small numbers, used inflate headline. 
 
The people included study “included received testing least twice: associated COVID-19–like illness hospitalization January–September 2021 least earlier (since February 1, 2020, ≥14 days hospitalization).” seems sensible, explain means “once associated”. provide criteria “COVID-19–Like Illness”. Further, saying candidates needed two positive tests, implies positive test hospital required counted “COVID-19–Like Illness”. 
 
None fatal. However, failure provide data sensitivity analysis surrounding assumptions, swing 50 people would completely flip study, is. Well. federal funds.  totally agree! 👍 fLu. polls terrible accurate

Well one way you’re right.

When poll 6 months ago, parents 12-17 year-old kids, 1/3 said would get kid vaccinated immediately approved. actuality took 2 months get *first* doses done 33% kids age group. think still misunderstanding statistics work. think Sao Paulo also lying? nadvertently one researchers became asymptomatically infected SARS CoV-2, exhaled Wuhan population.

If infectious enough lab, infectious enough market wild.

Edit: also, fuck chinese government. think I'm protecting whatever, beyond gone. blames flu vaccine 12 years ago serious bout landed hospital asthma.

No, works. flu vaccine can't cause flu. got flu immediately got vaccination, means already infected.    Yeah person talked like “oh kids getting vaccines, now?”. 🤦🏻‍♀️. Really didn’t inspire confidence    country dealt best.    also agree jail needed - dishonorable isn’t question mind  influential politicians pushed US intelligence community towards finding would justify sides' rhetoric. They're pretty indifferent geopolitical fallout.

By February 2020, already detailed examinations viral genome pointing tell-tale signs genetic manipulation, genome appeared consistent wild-type bat coronaviruses. key piece missing wild bat coronavirus receptor binding domain similar SARS CoV-2's, [last three wild bat coronaviruses found Laos similar RBDs.

I think still range possibility Wuhan Instutute Virology, surveys bat coronaviruses prevent repeat 2003 SARS, collected inadvertently distributed SARS CoV-2. viral isolate researching manipulating, one first steps research sequencing genome, posting international databases scientific priority.

So, wild bat virus, evidence genetic manipulation.

Antivaxxer propaganda chickens coming home roost. Sad though ordinary citizens end paying lives.  understand, risk benefit ratio.  Among elderly benefit enormous risk tiny. Among little kids benefit (to kid, society whole) nearly big worried possible fertility issues DNA changes heart problems would much bigger problem kids old people.  

Note: know vaccine change DNA evidence causes fertility issues. I'm explaining might vaccinate kids even vaccinated themselves. got booster day asked staff software upgrade tracking chip replacing batteries. said software upgrade ;-)   study comes several caveats, however. researchers cautioned findings may translate non-hospitalized people different levels access medical care, patients vaccinated group may unknowingly also previous Still, patterns emerged. Two doses mRNA vaccine produce antibodies, reliably so, coronavirus infection does. antibodies prior infection diverse, potentially helping people fend variants.

Another study data comes different conclusion study demonstrated natural immunity confers longer lasting stronger protection infection, symptomatic disease hospitalization caused Delta variant SARS-CoV-2, compared BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals previously infected SARS-CoV-2 given single dose vaccine gained additional protection Delta variant.

Still, agree CDC Whatever effect, doctors warned acquiring natural immunity perilous uncertain. everyone survives Covid first place, may able count vigorous immune response.

Long covid, asthma conditions even mild infection joke. think family never get COVID since beginning pandemic really is, horrible stomach issues years missed much school. relieved get vaxed Covid thought bleeding disease clotting disease kid would bad news. signed early vax age group even though issues weren’t technically list.  Seriously, I've got 4 yo torture. Gravity theory, research know someone came Chronic Fatigue Syndrome making thru E. coli. E. coli bad stuff. Actually, polio vaccination causes cases polio every year.  2nd dose knocked flat 4 days, booster well. (Pfizer 3.)

Still 100% worth it. need 4th dose point, I’ll again.

That said, coworkers got Moderna boosters didn’t feel much anything 3 doses. One got flu symptoms 12 hours dose 2 3. felt fine. reference, tend outlier since even flu shot knocks ass day. :P would like stop Yup. expected antibodies infection protection wane again. many traditional diets world high fat without seeing increase obesity see Western Diet Western lack exercise countries. information recently, (FDA review)will getting delivered weekend. information received thousands pages explaining enormous amount data points.

The parents complaining 4 days long ones complain rushed negative incidents turn gets approved. Klassy. allow people roll dice that?

Because hospitals fill unvaccinated people, someone normal medical emergency may get care. already happening. entire point ""flattening curve"" solely delay space infections, hospitals turn away patients easily treatable ailments, die searching bed. Last November girlfriend sick 10-12 days, working home, live together. Literally 0 precautions order get infected. bed, bedroom etc. made tests month later, antibodies, didn't. However, never got sick.
 Later spring came (March), went fishing cousin one weekend. days later one friends got positive (and sadly, died 20 days that). cousin light cought fishing. tested next day positive, later - sick 10-12 days. 2.5 hours traveling car direction lake back. get sick.

I fully vaxed (7 months ago) looking towards booster.  lot vaccines multi-shot series none shots boosters.

This exactly. always thought bit odd call second shot covid vaccines ""booster"". Instead, would say vaccine ""2-piece-product"".

I sometimes used shoe analogue this. first put left shoe place, put right shoe place, surely call right shoe ""booster""? simply another one shoes.

However, get third shot, scope original product, *would* booster. remember watching videos weeping. almost forgot attention span attacked times. become? Luckily need evaluation credentials. See above. Oh, made-up? desisive is!
Hmm, crapolia. Gravity strong nuclear force full support. speaking weak nuclear force, though, we're good terms. third booster doesn’t restore antibody levels shot #2, end 3x many, it’s going take awhile batch wane, especially since broader set antibodies, standard falloff slow higher baseline. baseline high enough prevent infection, severe disease, hospitalization, death? We’ll find out. Probably need check back 8 months see.

But numbers study good (and expect are) boosted vaccine actually upper 90s-percent vaccine efficacy Delta, it’s quite possible won’t need another booster new variant comes impacts neutralizing I’m Canada vaccinated everything else. It’s mandatory schools here. I’m arguing vaccines work, I’m vaccinated. think risk kids low even symptomatic covid. It’s equivalent flu shot kid. Im saying never, rushing subscribe. I'm it.
Got enough fu**in subscriptions is! “.005” here?       Yup!

Would vaccinating 5-11 year olds improve odds immunocompromised infected? vaccinated improves odds immunocompromised comes contact get infected; there's still possibility infect negate benefit vaccine. yet people still claim like damn flu study compared people received third shot people gotten original two- shot series. unvaccinated people study. 90% reductions serious illness death 3 shots versus 2 shots - 3 shots versus shots - obviously, numbers reported second shot versus 0 shots/the unvaccinated. even waning immunity time, definitely getting us back were. it’s actually pretty impressive.

One minor nitpick: summarise result ""more 19m"" think misreading graphic little. graphic shows best-guess estimate 16.6m based numbers 95% confidence interval ranging 10.2m 19.3m. 16.6m frighteningly large number already… massive spike preventable deaths.

Denmark administering third shot 80+ now. everyone else expects third shot around january on. anyone source fact Moderna booster lower dose? seen Israel  I'm confused. regard risk populations evidence toward booster recommendation currently approved age groups (18+) regardless risk status? NOBODY teach pinch nosepiece down, Magen? sucking blowing unfiltered air past eyeballs. I'm ok weak nuclear force, Van der Waals force sticking point. Spread spread. pandemic doesn’t end spread does. I’m kinda fence whether take Pfizer booster, 1st 2nd dose Sinopharm, almost 6 months ago. 🤔  people afraid needles need overcome phobia getting shot. people believe need vaccines anti-vaxxers regardless personal choices. Got 3rd Moderna earlier today. Hopefully tomorrow won’t rough 🥴  Fair enough, opinions opinion empathy always good thing. don’t know you’re apathetic. decade people required get vaccinated lose job? Denied schooling? reason never asked never absolutely mandated before. Doctors could write exemptions natural immunity accepted. know families never vaccinated children never denied jobs/school/travel etc. never asked never needed before.

Of course leaves open small loop hole that, say, ship Europe *could* sail supply country size NYC. could trade US instead. docking policy means every ship choose trading US trading got booster last Friday NYU told qualify come get due rare immune compromised disease have. came electronically sign form I'm immune compromised. showed checked chart proof make sure immune compromised giving booster.

Omg one got hard! Luckily BF taking good care me. worth though, sure. Hopefully something us immune compromised folks. slip vaccinated spread vaccines don’t benefits symptom reduction? vaccines reduce spread, significantly reducing risk infection first place (an uninfected person’s risk spread another literally infinitely lower infected person’s, vaccinated not) reducing severity infection average thus reducing contagious period. get boosters, starting get meaningful real world data seems coming back even better optimistic expectations. guys lucky. parents stayed inside like year, got first dose, got sick 2 weeks later. got 2nd dose 3 months later (they're AZ), signs getting booster due Asia. best thing long term effects. many countries people even gotten first dose, rich countries move booster plan.  fair, 2nd shot around 60% effective unvaxxed waning, 90% greater efficacy brings around 96% efficacy unvaxxed, ballpark original numbers. stuff that's like 90% effective something, there's much room left that. person anxiety, 0 problem someone exaggerating status get booster shot. help mental health getting booster, it. got mine yesterday (as catjuggler said, depression list qualify) ask anything me. prepared say depression pre-diabetes (a stretch) questioned. Get mental health want it.

Got day started looking one, supply issue.  Good riddance anyone wrapped theories willing compromise safety children co workers. Let find job working home. dont even talks boosters here... already time get one, damn frustrating. Nailed it. lengths people go lie themselves. Realistically, long term side effects haven’t gotten long term yet. Sequelae appear many years post infection. truly hope nothing, don’t victory lap yet. soon drug addicts fat people overwhelm healthcare system bring knees, rationing care every year, turned away too. never will, poor choices unvaxd filling hospitals right now. got EUA like 10 days ago people qualified they're far enough dose 2. Think meant ethical.  booster criteria loose probably 90% adults qualify soon. Like, even obese qualify weight- overweight enough that's 75% Americans. also added depression mental health qualifiers, unfortunately anxiety definitely needs lol. *is* Supreme Court case dissents three conservative justices, high court rejected group workers one employer said religious views put risk losing jobs health-care practice. challengers said object three available vaccines links cell lines derived aborted fetuses. wtf exact experience here. Anyway, here’s Van der Waals think bigger time gap half dose make probably less bad second. That's experience booster week least. That's right along lines reported second shot.

No! numbers relative people two shots waiting immunity. *much* better relative unvaccinated 2 dose numbers reported!

The booster shot gives much higher antibody levels 2 dose vaccines ever did. Must good gold insurance plan way person would ever think statement sane. I'd much rather cuba paying nothing brain surgeries throughout life worrying lose job something happens ill tens thousands debt here. achy day quite bad second shot. true religious people. Probably even most. think find many people think religious feel need flaunt publicly. typically sane ones. feel like science communicators could better phrasing these. assume means chances hospitalized covid double vaxed person (say, 10%- know), third booster reduces 10% risk 93%, would make 1% chance 99% effective presenting hospitalization. people paying less attention, less good math, intentionally picking worse #s, going assume means 3 shots, there's still 19% chance die 3 shots, good chance anything. Thank you!! found hard way I'm allergic something vaccine. Due almost dieing one let get booster. means world see know people really right thing. helping protect us need it. Likely 6 months immunity wanes there's different variants. expected anyone brain beginning shit show. understanding right suggests people may even stronger protection third shot kicks people immediately 2nd shot?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Why? guess reason know long term side effects yet. hey everyone gets what's issue. Would unfair participate.  basically NYT reaction shocking 40% CDC statistic ""Nah! What? can't be, here's why. kids fine..!"" don’t even realize would dump pretty much everything medicine cabinet don’t want use product tested cell lines. Basically shun modern medicine entirely. wife got 3rd Moderna shots Thursday night. Yesterday little rough we're back 100% morning besides lingering arm soreness. quite bad 2nd shot, least me. hate every week get direct opposite study results pumped news feeds.  That’s bingo! also one appointment part test. really bad analogy.

For record I've never heard anyone refer shots singular like that. guess research medications used cell line development. Spoiler alert Tylenol, Advil, Benadryl, albuterol, Robitussin few! F “killing child” BS. would sooner let real children die using life saving vaccines medications use vaccine tested old cell line 1970s? moral compass might broken that’s case.   believe tested stem cell lines originated abortions something. really sincerely hold belief, I’m ok long apply belief everything take. means, generally take prescription counter medications all, majority tested cell lines question. includes things like antacid ibuprofens etc. want see sincere beliefs get sick. No, vaccines waning - general.

With Moderna Pfizer, least, two kinds people get seriously ill Covid: Unvaccinated old ill (often both).

If 65, vaccinated otherwise healthy, unlikely get seriously ill. Much less getting seriously ill viruses like flu.

Conversely, third shot boosting seems like waste currently. Send vaccines countries still trouble rolling first wave vaccines instead.

(I got info Danish media numbers ) FWIW religion made crap. made stuff followed larger groups, doesn’t make less true. Botched neutering leading long, slow painful death Hobbes Calvin bravely stayed side… sad story around. Apparently, stench dying flesh tiger almost unbearable, but, again, Calvin stood best friend literally rotted alive location former testicles mid way body death finally took him.

If Hobbes hadn’t started spraying mark territory, could avoided. many childhood vaccinations, get 2-5 doses vax sufficient immunity life. expect get global handle covid, less mutate vaccinations give longer immunity doses. stays current levels, continue mutate may need dose every year like flu.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Discharge goodbye.  You’re own.  Ha ha.  Simpson’s laugh. Go fuck corn. shame. Yup, that's large column right: 74 unvaccinated, 3 starting vaccination, 137 vaccinated. 28 (from groups) ICU. 

Among vaccinated, mostly 65+ age group. risk going hospital vaccinated 65 currently small. Also, stated numbers, average length time hospitalization gone vaccinated patients.

While 74 unvaccinated mostly age 16-64. 

We'll certainly see rising number infections winter, perhaps even large surge. Certainly lot kids many unvaccinated adults infected. 

The great open question affects hospitalization: health care cope? efficiacy decline rapidly? 

I'm guessing we'll see reintroduction measures point. based number infections alone. we're still far numbers last winter. misinformation good-faith speculation potential outcomes based available knowledge. Scott Gottlieb thinks every 6 12 months. See 30s mark video below. booster falls 6 month range Fire them.  hunch comes me, virologist. necessarily mean true lol fearmongering state simple facts.   Yeah, definitely hoping hear.  Ahhhh don’t fur. 🐭   Oh, ok stats skewed.

Is graph shows 200ish people hospitals moment covid absolute numbers? 

So far, understand unvaccinated ones creating surge cases. expert said apply restrictions spring achieved full immunity (artificial + natural immunity).

I feel things clearly stated public, really depressing 1 month ago Denmark cradle post-covid life high vaccination rate fast forward now, reached almost 2k cases waiting new restrictions. hoping could get free four months Kindle Unlimited software update remembered Bill Gates putting chip vaccine Bezos.  found amazing earlier study clearly data comparison previous infection vaccination, decided to. becomes possible 90 days. becomes statistically likely around 12 16 months.    go get it. Say essential worker. Evey job essential ;) would could true original double vaccination efficacy rates done strains. can't remember dealing data Delta age, think were, since got later studies assured us vaccines still quite effective Delta, need look sure either way. So, odds adverse event happening right 20% (100% - 80%). get Pfizer, odds adverse event happening 10% 20%, 0.1 * 0.2 0.02, so, terms people reporting things, 98% efficacy. Good luck. get mine next week, I'm hoping going hit like #2 did. Thankfully one day mostly slept through.  terrible study. CDC releases study summary reads:

""A study hospitalized patients symptoms similar Covid-19 found unvaccinated people previous infection 5x likely positive Covid-19 test compared unvaccinated people. Get vaccinated ASAP""

Everything summary infographic completely solid grounded data. However, time CNN makes headline, becomes:

""Vaccination protects Covid-19 strongly previous infection does, CDC study finds""

This nearly airtight, could even argue misleading.

In terms statistical adjustment, would submit criminal adjust. unvaccinated mostly 18-49 years old, whereas vaccinated 75-84. number cases reported (hundreds) smaller observational studies also larger clinical trial data, anyway errors observe probably going sampling biases sampling statistics. failing fit tests N95s last resort, type even yet tried scores went near perfect pinched nose. also find safety goggles good indicator depending whether fog not. Saturday reported **40,251 new COVID-19 infections** last 24 hours, highest single-day case tally since start pandemic. 
The government’s coronavirus taskforce reported **1,160 deaths** related virus, three short daily record 1,163 set day before. 
Russia go nationwide workplace shutdown first week November capital Moscow reimposed partial lockdown Thursday, essential shops like pharmacies supermarkets allowed remain open.

Government numbers. math adding percentages?

So Moderna I'm still 80% protected get pfizer, gives maybe another 90%, percent protected I?  Asthma Hives I’m allergic something. took vaccine covid effects lungs/breathing. Knowing crappy Asthma is, I’m gonna try experience Covid end ventilator. Take damn shot fools! People excuses truly show afraid vaccine actual Covid threat. “Logic”.    Yeah military tear gas something little different. high concentrations burns every pore   1/3 adolescent/adult dose. ‘vaccines aren’t enough’ brigade pretty loud past couple days. What’s going on?  get 6G upgrade? Russia awful handling since start pandemic significantly bad waves past, current one worst. China done great far though, opinion. 

In county US, gave mask mandate months, likely foreseeable future, maintaining number cases couple days China last week. 

My friend moved back China sometime mid 2020 due different handling COVID, they've complained everything country except COVID situation basically. able tour densely populated areas worry getting infected. 

China squashed larger outbreaks current one, faith deal one too. Millions people die COVID spreads China, right? stakes high, that's understood. finally! lets beat plague Seems like people mild reactions 3rd dose. got 3rd Pfizer days ago bad 2nd dose. Ended 101 fever, body aches, chills, etc. However pregnant could factor since doesn’t seem like norm booster. Still worth it. odds data manipulation PRC? mean media always say they're delta covid outbreak data available online seem show opposite. Actually no. study numbers, comparing “Vaccinated 2-doses” “Vaccinated 3-doses” individuals. 

The improvements groups, unvaccinated. 

I trouble understanding % effectiveness, dive study’s data, found 2x dosers compared 3x were: 

* 5.4x likely positive COVID test
* 6.5x likely symptomatic COVID infection
* 7.97x likely admitted hospital
* 9.2x likely severe COVID
* 6.3x likely die COVID

And remember study didn’t contain “unvaccinated” control group, double dosers already *significantly* protected COVID unvaccinated.  long? That's info want see Oh got third dose. First two came CVS -- third, found little hole-in-the-wall pharmacy best service I've ever limited experience pharmacies.  2nd Pfizer dose destroyed me. ~72 hours. I'm hoping Moderna booster affect badly... reminded look variants circulating, turns out, one.

All future variants descendants Delta. sad came great greek letter naming system, we're going ruin Delta.v2.ay.61.3d3d3 instead ""Nu"". here!! got sore arm, nearly sore first two shots. Air travel US requires proof vaccination foreign nationals starting November believe. Given J&amp;J 7 months ago I'd personally get booster. yet know much Novavax particularly Delta (and modest Alpha) terms longevity, I'd stick official recommendations get J&amp;K boost. Novavax probably good, know good, know booster schedules. guys can’t even figure created mandate (it mayor State). Really making case best brightest irreplaceable. 2nd Moderna knocked ass 24 hours. booster Tuesday sore arm fatigue next day. Took nap fine. Definitely bad #2 was! true then, treatment basically effect lifespan. Treatment even reduce viral load point undetectable non- transmittable opposed JandJ? society exerts power citizens every day. forced cover genitals, wear seatbelt, can't leave country without showing papers (passport); list long. accept power us limitations freewill cost security living amongst community. honestly elementary level stuff, anti-vaxers aware social contract live limited everyday?

Gross Jungle sequel, talk making America great again. antivaxxer, needlephobic mice too?/s

Anyway patching technology could break think places antivax movement would loose traction. surprised many people afraid needle even vulnerable group. Personally knew 3, - phobia needles - started antivax journey, 'religion '. saving life. cell line referring feutus long gone 50 years ago. vaccinated people killing people actually alive (mostly themselves/yourselves). taking vaccine dieing change outcome long ago feutus, aborted someone thought vaccines medical testing. decision save anyone. useless action actually harms people alive still saved. anything taking life saving vaccines resulted cells gives greater purpose feutus' brief existence. know must able understand this, gain refusing acknowledge it?    Dissenters as?  large-scale Israeli study published Friday showed third booster shot 92% effective preventing serious illness compared received two doses Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine

The title misinformation. 92% compared already pretty good two shots! Yes, get third full dose immunocompromised. family member immunocompromised told specifically request third dose booster. CVS‘s vaccine scheduling page gives option choose “third dose” “booster” scheduling Moderna. Mine getting second it’s available. prepped flu shot many discussions means she’s beyond ready. Let’s get done. Thanks yeah. practically begging someone give booster teach 600 unvaccinated kids week. Hoping come something protect meantime leave house without n95 I'm thankful getting boosters helping protect people like me. vaccine slow spread.   potential benefit reduced symptoms infected

&amp;#x200B;

yeah no. flat wrong fly face reality. Bloomberg article doesn’t say think does. Stop spreading misinformation, need take step back consider idea you’re completely mistaken. Pretty much me. caught covid days second shot. Felt bit crappy days lost smell month so. long-term effects. cop many years ago, put us old school bus, opened CS gas us sit prove mostly mind matter.

Interesting concept, think labeled essentially tool block worker rights every industry? think took point backwards intended it.

A 0.002% chance big deal governments, big deal you, individual.

A medical policy setter come terms fact decision affect bunch people. Assuming country 100 million people two clotting events per 100,000 doses, going get something like 4,000 clotting events. That's risk policy setters need balance whatever disease they're combating.

As individual, 0.002% absolutely nothing. put perspective, could take shot every single day, nintey years (32850 doses), still better 50:50 chance never experiencing clotting.

Or put another way, could take vaccine every day year, chance ok would 99.3%.

In words, risk (as someone take couple doses) so, tiny really warrant much concern. Wow, realize HIV/AIDS worse Spanish Flu. still remember kid fear instilled us HIV every health class. use condom could die basically. doctor every allergist office called within 2 hour drive. Due various allergies allow get additional shots. I'm thankful least got two moderna. Second shot went anaphylaxis 2 min. 
But good news got flu shot year incidents! keep delta forever. They'll controlled burn like NZ, Australia Singapore point. want exemption based reason, going need grow food stop using basically every medicine, healthcare product, cosmetic tons things.

I think actually work way. Like let's say religion specifies pork, believe would better eat pork, nonetheless give eat pork sometimes due self control issues. still could compelled eat pork eg company lunch long clear religious beliefs sincere religion says pork. matter there's video eating pork facebook dated day company lunch; ready abstain pork protected civil rights laws.

One obvious difference vaccination impacts people's health/safety global emergency. Generally, religious beliefs accommodated work they're putting people's safety risk. thought might justice's reasoning. Turns court whole gave explanation. concurring opinion, Justices Amy Coney Barrett Brett Kavanaugh indicated didn’t see case good candidate considered merits novelty issues.

Uh, okay. Thanks supreme court. nice supreme court used explain decisions guess time gone. might well be. Denmark, though, Pfizer dominates used vaccine. us offered third shot, beginning oldest age groups.     experience wondering need booster.

M/31. got J&amp;J March. mild-ish side effects. 101 fever, chills, horrible fatigue 2 days. pleasant, horrible. mostly thankful suck bad.

Am better getting J&amp;J shot #2 mix match? smart enough sift data. Stop. sound dumb. explore medium enough see J&amp;J AZ would safe? whigs pretty short lived party collapsed ages ago... certainly realistic party collapse due power they've accumulated. even reasonable, they'd replaced one one. It'd remain two party system. hardly matters anyway parties important matters. serve elites. Count towards anecdotal data. Arm soreness fatigue day after. Nothing like second dose Moderna.  1 year - ""Studies show bi-monthly shots reduce covid rates 95%!"" Reinfection recovering covid rare. Reinfection vaccination even rare. Reinfection recovery full vaccination rare even data it.
 
Is possible? Yes. sense anything possible. Extremely unlikely. That’s false. Literally hundreds! concern vulnerable vaccinated first totally valid. doesn’t mean boosters aren’t needed effective general population. China claims 8,000 cases 0 deaths since January.

That tell trustworthy data is. Put “papers” phone. Super easy convenient.  Seems like outdoors would fine. However, I'd still wear mask indoor game, yelling. stadiums/teams also require vaccine test.

Asking quick clarification. say mortality reduced 81% mean say "" experience severe illness mortality reduced 81%"" understand reduce hospitalizations severe illness 90% reduce mortality 80%.  Findings

1 158 269 individuals eligible included third dose group. Following matching, third dose control groups included 728 321 individuals. Participants median age 52 years (IQR 37–68) 51% female. median follow-up time 13 days (IQR 6–21) groups. Vaccine effectiveness evaluated least 7 days receipt third dose, compared receiving two doses least 5 months ago, estimated 93% (231 events two doses vs 29 events three doses; 95% CI 88–97) admission hospital, 92% (157 vs 17 events; 82–97) severe disease, 81% (44 vs seven events; 59–97) COVID-19-related death.
Interpretation

Our findings suggest third dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine effective protecting individuals severe COVID-19-related outcomes, compared receiving two doses least 5 months ago.  7 day hospitalization statistic compelling: shows 65 fully vaccinated, currently almost certain end hospital get breakthrough infection.

A lockdown would indeed help, many people possible working home harm pro-vaccine lots harm anti-vaccine. Ooh, pro-plague shills force today. Think terms population. US population 106 million 1920, century later, 335 ish million. So, 700k 1920 would hit lot harder 700k today. 

Also, HIV slow killer. 37million died, far, another 37.7 million living HIV today.

The CDC good reason recommendations.  mention, claim “99%” tends use total deaths versus total population world.

Which survival rates work diseases. anything, really. Smoking killed 8,000,000 people last year. (1,200,000 non smokers)

The government pretends something, really want spend money. Neither people businesses money afford even short lockdowns. measures mostly affect school university students, schools completely closed, universities online. think posted times already. remember reading numbers least twice. :) HIV stigma makes seem way, modern drugs basically makes life normal essentially risk spreading meds. Undetectable = Untransmittable Caveat “While antibodies specific SARS-CoV-2 variant able generate strong response infection variant, results showed antibodies less effective fighting different variants.”

I hope get people vaccinated strain develops immunity system cannot easily fight even enhanced vaccines. Well, 2 things. 

HIV virus causes AIDS condition. AIDS determined T-cell count. hits certain threshold, developed AIDS. HIV kills cells.

However, still get T-Cells count zone regain health. (almost) never get rid virus HIV. (Only two cases far)

This people die “HIV related illnesses” instead AIDS. AIDS simply body T-cells due HIV virus. 

Luckily, point preventative medication really take HIV out. Based figure 1, 2 vaccinations chances hospitalisation (~0.3%) death (~0.03%) reduced 0.00-something booster. I'm booster statistics seem misrepresent wider picture way people may think 2 vaccinations giving far less protection actually are. Also survival rate varies great deal according age/ comorbidities etc. I'd love detailed breakdown survival rate different categories might freak people enough get vaccinated! You’re absolutely right! bad. remember seeing third dose vs booster page setting CVS appointment. May ask get data? checked Chinese new app phone. death number Sep.02 5685, today 5696. sample size two three shots

the virus literally affects everyone differently, may asymptomatic

people run around even knowing shit you’re talking study “it reduces hospitalization”

how would know shit it’s asymptomatic? people randomly get tested feel fine? top you’re extrapolating something like hospitalization rates mortality that

gimme break Luckily much 'if' anymore, least US. enough programs easily accessible point makes HIV meds even PrEP basically free. Gilead even coupon card covers deductible/co-pay you. That’s horrible thing say. Good news! Pfizer Ceo has. Per google. Didn’t bother look j j yet. True. I'm math people like percents well whole figures. days modern medicine, masks quarantines best could do. generally helpful.  said 'any little bit' in, little bit top already win. blame R U P directly large percentage deaths. people shouldn’t teaching children begin with. observed sample size 730,000 people received third shot compared equivalent sample size people received two shots. recorded results came percentages. understand research works?

Colorado instance there's email address contact resolves issues (I go since vaccinations correctly digitally recorded), doctors offices also.

You probably call ask doctor. 100%? even bother! /s probably asked already.. got boosters, mix? stick one? problem seems unvaccinated, look likely become less dangerous flu, ever. workplace regulations require assume coworkers unvaccinated act accordingly. genuinely understand get place stuff like travel, work person, go playground, visit museums, on. People simply vaccinated transmission going continue forever unvaccinated people still going greatly risk. Heck, even vaccinated people dying COVID-19 (at drastically reduced rate, ofc!!!).

So many people area aren’t getting vaccinated. want it, go get I’m telling everyone.

In contrast, Spain sitting past 80% full vaccination rate need mandates thing.

It sure isn’t 50/50 thing, it’s still huge nonetheless sorry struggles. hope get back pre pandemic mental health. hope go back treating respect every human deserves. December probably lower age country.  cold! don’t respect freedom giving s… let kill others? probably combination things. Better ventilation (cheap leaky shelters, time outdoors instead conditioned indoor spaces), lower average population age (and poor healthcare already killed many vulnerable population), poor reporting systems least factors. raw ratios tend overstate effectiveness especially results get rare. 

For example, booster reduces mortality 81%. Another common method reporting changes chance percentage points. Assume going 25% something happening 50% chance something happening. report either 100% increase chance 25 percentage point increase. 

For study hand, .006% people 2 shots died .001% people booster died. .005 percentage point reduction, i.e. booster saves 5 lives every 100,000. percentage point angle import things like prioritizing health care spending prioritizing vaccine distribution. case redirecting shot someone unvaccinated would result much higher percentage point reduction, i.e. much likely save life. Like others saying, boosters currently open much wider group immunocompromised. know, however, dosage Moderna vaccine changes depending whether immunocompromised, might checking intensely. Also, think last Friday first day booster group expanded, least close. might went process. hope feel better!  incredible ""let wash over"" fringe idea solid political support US accepted policy countries failed spectacularly. still de facto policy states. disappointing. cant ""99.9 eradicate"" something. binary. not.

That’s like optional, non Covid flu didn’t shut whole world. risk flu, Covid. Probably cuz I’m couch w covid right issue ....so far. Hard enough time convincing everyone get 2 shots, would get 3?

I know TBE Europe 3 shots, seems past rules apply covid shots someone similar position: changed formula pertussis vaccine mid 90s using whole pertussis virus using specific antigens (that's ""a"" TDaP) many people bad reactions that. got DTP kid, may allergic Tdap. got DTaP, that's new version probably get booster. question come 2nd Circuit Court Appeals covers NY, previous SCOTUS decisions dicta suggested same: right religious exemptions vaccine requirements.

That's ridiculous judge put hold vaccine mandates... openly defying binding precedent cockamamie legal theory differentiated mandates. vaccine mandates good business rather desire right thing. upvotes people see bigger picture. saving lives, money greed. 

It started ""just vaccine"". went 2 shots, 3. want us believe natural immunity exist. That's set us shots. Lol. 

I'm vaccine. means, take many shots desire! keep mind accomplishing making rich richer. amount vaccine eradicate Covid. hey, ""feel"" safer though 😏

To add insult injury, we're paying ""free"" vaccines. believe me? Take look next pay stub. called taxes! 

While government print money, real money taxes pay. politicians trying figure pay all, means taxes! Seeing chaos happening american vaccine quite terrifying point i’m feeling anti-vax isnt anti-vax, rather pent frustration able control another human beings.

Everyone missing point isnt we. takes one anti-vax buddy ruin everything.  figure that?   mix-and-match Walgreens last Wed. problem. J&amp;J originally -- got Pfizer booster. definition overweight BMI threshold pretty low, especially taller. suspect right obesity issue US certainly factor, 75% number bit misleading.  /u/smaller_god good response, I'd like add couple things.

As others pointed thread, booster actually results *more* recovery antibodies- antibody counts higher post-2 weeks second shot. memory B cells also broader profile antibodies create eradicate virus (because experience) thus generally better ability handle variants. 

The body evolved time handle threats, immune system done same. body want invest, say- bunch energy produce memory B cells broad profiles also maintain massive antibodies pathogen sees (first shot). invader appears, immune system learns bind destroy it, takes note how, lets antibodies fade goes back BAU.

Once invaders come back (second shot)- still relatively shortly afterwards (3-4 weeks)- immune system produces antibodies knowing knows. invader seen again, immune system going take seriously- going drop antibodies dedicate resources understanding pathogen see again. Many antibodies made, broad profile antibodies stored B cells, etc.

Now invader shows *again*, time 6 months later. immune system gets practice, gets build even breadth antibodies, etc. Beyond that, immune system conditioned effective, efficient (not panic bomb entire areas cells [cytokine storm]), able quickly adapt variants (since already many tricks built memory, see works doesn't, etc).

When get *actual* SARS-COV2- lets say hypothetically mutated spike protein makes antibodies ineffective- immune system still knows damn well move forward. already knows work, experience broadening attack strategy. knows threat recurrent (or least similar one was), prepared invest resources clearly threat going away.

The immune system needs practice, unlike brain say ""man need practice X need good Y"" immune system needs pathogens munch on, etc.

I layman fwiw.. CVS Walgreens.

Got booster last Wednesday Walgreens. eligible, ticked generic box online reservation form, questions person. web site also show vaccine they're serving various locations, preference.

Yes, rammed entirely elective booster shot throats. anyone thinking getting vaccine first time make sure rush interval first second shot. whole point boost response wait long enough really that. would argue actually better wait longer 3 weeks initially suggested, believe data following suggestion well. discovered lack initial vaccines makes sense immunological standpoint. covid overwhelmingly killed people long life anyway that's big difference. 

Just lie, whether comorbidities accounted not:

The average life expectancy COVID victim 10 years Italy accounting finds morbidities calculated expectancy co-morbidities baked also fell study also calculates morbidities (though pre Delta) finds even higher average years life lost (16) though includes poorer countries inferior compared HIV average years life lost 11.92:

""the number years lost life HIV-stricken individuals estimated 11.92 Deaths infections months ago. wave deaths much longer tail wave infections, least available hospital care.

Excess deaths Florida (which may still change, likely increasing, death certificates handed out) ~3750 peak week, highest weekly total counted state ~2700. always happened everywhere capacities strained,  May 2021, 83% blood donors Covid antibodies. pretty certain it’s higher now, considering vaccinations infections since then. coworker blamed death vaccinated neighbor unvaccinated, three weeks ago. said “the vaccinated milder symptoms, likely public sick unvaccinated, far fewer them”. looked like flat earther, unwilling believe vaccinated person could infected neighbor. vaccinated still convinced wear masks believe they’re unable spread Covid? think it’s pretty clear us Covid comes waves. Currently seems like Florida waves. Hopefully population immune enough make sure next wave less deadly. pure bullshit. ranks Florida 7th highest COVID cases per capita. No, technically need six months *and* qualifying medical work condition. Tbf, conditions super broad though. said anyone isn’t vaccinated probably caught it. said vaccinated people also get it. say that’s factually incorrect there?

Because people get vaccinated less likely everyone catch letter Sun-Sentinel, Yahoo News, agency responsible keeping official covid data. You’re one saying specific numbers fake zero evidence. Agreed? not, please show specific numbers showing Florida lowest covid positivity rate found fake.

At least patient test positive last month half cases way city. Hopefully new wave come anytime soon. Yeah there's lot perfectly normal comments votes. petty be? Booster now. knows long specific boosters come would even much effective. Remember, we're begin winter. 

As booster, somebody top posted chart shows effective combination boosters (search username thread) . shows Moderna booster slightly effective originally took Pfizer. difference huge enough FYI. One thing though, get side effects Pfizer, probably wont get Pfizer booster. There's chance Moderna. live Tonga yeah, good run. 
However there’s good chance they’ll able contain virus island Tongatapu gets quarantine.  still support trial doctors? think one cases quantitative antibody test would helpful, although expert interpret context live Tonga. 

There’s really good chance it’ll stay isolated Tongatapu make ‘most’ islands. They’ve already cut flights ferries islands waiting results remaining tests. yeah, there’s good chance Tongatapu fucked. huge ethnic correlation. Mostly IQ level. There's dimwits colors refuse. Dear COVID: please spare shirtless Olympic flag bearer Tonga. Thank behalf women gay men everywhere.  sigh relief former coworkers. bet they're glad listen whiny, misinformational bullshit anymore. Home tests reliable low viral loads, gold standard PCR test sensitive it'd likely return positive lingering virus even dead. Masks effective extended personal contact. whether probable outcome - infection risk -is worth risking. friend I'd risk fully vaccinated healthy. baby... think evidence suggests fine, although I'm damned I'd it. course BS. nearly zero religions prohibit (just couple obscure ones people probably never heard of). amusing part I've seen people state religion, informed religion prohibit it, come BS ""well, entitled practice religion however interpret it"". Yeah, interpret religion God telling shit middle grocery store aisle, get free pass that? think not.  course expect expedite actual process. expect start process immediately, though.

Like, oh no, might work weekend!? horror!  Wow shit vaccine lmao  vast majority world's population immunity - via vaccine infection - COVID less threat. look like something eradicate like small pox polio, hopefully we'll soon past ""hospitals overwhelmed"" portion epidemic. almost certainly become endemic, booster shots needed sort schedule, like plenty diseases. lockdown Moscow bring numbers down

Moscow responsible \~100 1000+ daily corona deaths. official data. Can't see Moscow Moscow region lockdowns could fix situation rest Russia. Well tbh America, there's probably nothing do/say since believe covid. Reason being, die, overwhelmingly likely unvaccinated... correlation unvaccinated believing covid pretty high. No. reduces transmission eliminate it. BRUH think 5 million lives nothing compared 7 billion. S/ crazy see international community cares lives Russian people Russians themselves. hate ! 19 million 7.9 billion isn’t bad, like .024%

Correction: 0.24% 100% possibly true. cannot go government communist country they'll make life hard unlike US thing even considered foolish standard. Ok eligible population then. That's still ridiculous. telling even one single person amongst eligible population anti vax? point still stands. matter segment population looking at. never 100 percent agreement. statistically impossible. Even asked 10000 people poll sky blue still segment people say otherwise. people wonder workers are. 

Narrator. : they’re dead. \*Russia Suffers Deadliest September Since World War II Non-Stalin Related Deaths. really though. imagine FDA needs prepare paperwork based decision CDC review making decision. We're talking making decision impacts 20 million children. ok they're thorough. CDC meeting 2 day process. expecting squeeze 2 days meetings post-5pm Friday afternoon? I've got 2 kids 11 under. Meeting Nov 2&amp;3 fine me.  add onto that, never possible (to knowledge) die virus without kind follow-on causes. Pneumonia, organ failure, toxicity, heart failure, whatever want call it, there's always proximal anatomical cause.

I really understand people say ""it virus, XYZ"" thinking. minds would virus cause death causing kind body failure could describe. true things like cancer too. want get it, every single death caused sort organ failure.     liquefied Kiwis would also fit roughly 5 million washing machines, put perspective Missouri-dwellers. look back month half see why.

The FDA VRBPAC meeting Pfizer booster adults September 17th.  corresponding CDC ACIP meeting scheduled September 22nd September 23rd. VRBPAC produced mixed recommendation approve everything Pfizer asked for.

FDA action approve Pfizer booster adults occur late September 22nd.  end first day, ACIP still sure would anything vote next day.

If VRBPAC voted for, say, one dose kids instead two, FDA would needed time chew proposal.  Thanos would proud guess  home state, Pennsylvania, appears bit uptick people getting first doses. Per covidactnow, 77% population least one dose, appears going 70 80% taking less time going 60 70% PA’s population getting one dose. 

I happy see this, wonder driving increase.  UK us actually seeing decrease cases again.

Most UK cases under-20s, schools half-term. decrease good news, give weeks opening champagne.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Okay thanks prefer look positive….. Covid could killed 1-3 billion people.

We’re lucky wasn’t horrible (just 0.005 billion). could far worse-off saw many sick kids class every kid actually gets tested, they'd horrified. ""one case"" six kids symptoms. ""allergies"". really scale anymore they're unemployed. They're sending money circles point. Ditto 3 factors. technical reasons, incompetence, malice say. 

Like earlier comment I’ve said throughout pandemic. 

I feel like situation example, aren’t counting cause death(COVID!)

A bus hits you. stop bleeding. die month later damage dealt accident. bus fucking killed you. reasons state, feel like must extremely common proverbial bus listed cause death. Could vaccines waning? I'd like see boosters EU. many incremental people born couples staying home more? teacher small kids, unless required, pandemic ending time soon. resigned school. parents, vaxxed, vehemently refusing littles. Numbers definitely line stat. people natural immunity vs. vaccinated people, immunity vs vaccinated people.

Seems crazy could confounder people likely actually get reinfection got immune response poor health, hence significantly likely get hospitalised, vs vaccination, general population. little reason worry COVID then.

Avoid bars/restaurants mountain nothing worry about. hospital ask receive Third dose (Booster)...

Someone received Third dose? Side effect? Pain? Strange effects? I’m vaccinated aren’t immune unvaccinated people? Imagine started count 5 million, saying 1 number every second. would take 55 days straight nothing counting. Great. Time life return normal: I'm sure hell going inconvenience life longer primarily protect anti-vaxxers. Apparently don’t care 20-40% dead previous pandemics either  fuck spy agencies finding origin? question scientists answer, spies. 

If can't find evidence came lab, say came nature? market? done 40 years ago. Set dedicated scalable treatment centers respiratory viruses expand winter surges, contract summer lulls available sudden disease outbreaks. relieve burden general hospitals protect rest patient population contagions allowing surgeries elective procedures continue. public funding predictable nature winter cold flu surges easily timeshare buildings targeting small subset treatments reduce overall cost care well. Every death sad. Every year 60 million people die (before pandemic hit).

0.005 divided 8 billion == 0.06% excess previous deaths.

At least wasn’t 20-40% world population dead like previous pandemics hit Roman era, Byzantine era, middle ages Skiing mostly, no. Duh. like regular seasonal flu shots, still catch &amp;/or spread flu. Getting shots minimizes severe illness &amp; vastly lowers mortality rates. true flu shot types.  plan kids 5? feel like US absolutely rampant this, “accident,” COVID deaths measured quantified categorized, purposeful depending region state. 

I’ve said while, haven’t looked it, I’d naive believe US counting people COVID, die month later testing negative damage dealt COVID deaths appropriate rate. 

Like, I’ve saying pandemic, bus hits you, stop bleeding, die month later; bus fucking killed still. risk virus kids 5-11 incredibly low, like commenter said, idea could potentially long term side effects vaccine, feel necessary. know (someone please correct wrong), unvaccinated kid significantly less risk vaccinated adult. Getting vaccinated also decreases risk transmission. oneself harmed antivax. kind doubt recover punitive damages workers comp claim 13.4% population (the unvaccinated) make 44% hospitalizations. Also consider children 13.4% far smaller chance hospitalized. I'd guess unvaccinated adults make well 50% hospitalized. Yeah exactly (even though ""personal"" estimate around 15 million, 0.19%) Yeah right, cares 5 million dead people! /s I've got superpowers bro!  Exactly. response much smarter kneejerk ""Duh."" lot Christian’s believe absent body present lord. feel saved going heaven don’t care die. Bet guess dissented. Plus takes time shots effective. someone gets vaccinated third it’s like max protection evening. Every day lost results needless Covid cases. drank wine bottle every day. US vaccination rate 58% fully vaccinated 67% least dose, like US dramatically different Cuba's 62% fully vaccinated rate. AP story since register read Bloomberg Supreme Court rejected emergency appeal health care workers Maine block vaccine mandate went effect Three conservative justices noted dissents. state offering religious exemption hospital nursing home workers risk losing jobs New York Rhode Island also vaccine mandates health care workers lack religious exemptions. subject court fights court allowed workers New York seek religious exemptions lawsuit plays high court previously turned away students Indiana University teachers New York City objected vaccinated. university city allow people seek religious Ya. Jesus died sins go heaven die. Immorality immunity disease wasn’t part deal. Wow, single comment story obliterates 5 million worldwide number accurate    understand get consequences would disobeying lawful order. That's basically they're doing.

We really need stop going easy people make horrible, dangerous (to others) decisions. highly doubt that’s decision make. Whether Moscow gets locked going Putin. Even US DC mayor wanted lock city could overridden moment federal government. saying left mexico search better life? remember seeing somewhere (can’t seem find source it) covid died 14 days, rule non-covid death. realized average person died covid around 18 days, decreased cap 24 (21?) days 14. 2/3’s cases disappeared change implemented.

Hard know positive face this, except use good old-fashioned denial. There's \~400 word paragraph end study disclosing limitations used findings report subject least seven limitations. First, although analysis designed compare two groups different sources immunity, patients might misclassified. SARS-CoV-2 testing occurred outside network partners’ medical facilities vaccinated persons less likely seek testing, positive SARS-CoV-2 test results might missed thus patients classified vaccinated previously uninfected might also infected. addition, despite high specificity COVID-19 vaccination status data sources, misclassification possible. Second, aOR could stratified time since infection vaccination sparse data limited ability control residual confounding could magnified within shorter intervals. aOR adjust time might also subject residual confounding, particularly related waning types immunity. Third, selection bias might possible vaccination status influences likelihood testing previous infection influences likelihood vaccination. Previous work VISION network identify systematic bias testing vaccination status, based data May 2021 (1). Fourth, residual confounding might exist study measure adjust behavioral differences comparison groups could modify risk outcome. Fifth, results might generalizable nonhospitalized patients different access medical care different health care–seeking behaviors, particularly outside nine states covered.

Nope, Federal fair, modern tech behind rampant proliferation virus too. haven’t heard eligibility varies state. Plenty doses assume they’re following CDC guidelines. even don’t think pharmacies really checking 7 million people die smoking tobacco year. Let sink in. Nah got sick, WASN’T COVID!! Sure dad died COVID SOMETHING ELSE cowards giving false information vaccines. Kinda funny say ""six kids symptoms"" one particular study found infection rates among students six times recall stories NPR height Delta variant India mentioning lots people sick dying home counted official data. afraid vocal minority reason. know covid short medium term -, long Covid good - know nothing long term. know vaccines safe short medium term, want everyone get especially since would slow spread overall, reduce community transmission make fewer orphans.

Strictly speaking, make accommodation superiors. tardy absent simply kept scheduled noon.

This quite different infectious disease. Good know! never laxative. avoid forever lol. Good news I'm lactose could ice cream lol.  know I'd say \*very\* risky. Data country 2 per 100,000 doses. means got 99.998% chance OK time.

It's nothing, given many doses rolled out, there's pretty large number people who've killed, disabled otherwise harmed AZ vaccine. something downplay.

But think makes sense stress much individual. Risks rare sort thing matter medical advisor deciding whether give million doses. almost meaningless person who's going two doses done it.  think scientists interests data spy agencies collected. example, agencies obtain large bio database viruses WIV agency report address this, either hiding info CNN got wrong.

Also agencies conclude Chinese government knowledge virus pandemics. think difference isn’t big left wants think is. Bought get booster week Moderna. bad history vaccinations though. queen allergies :(  vaccine? concerned bad reaction immune response previous vaccines. allergist try Miralax PEG components vaccine preview see could handle vaccine. did, sounds like may want avoid laxative aisle! Five million people globally died respiratory infection - dying every day. vaccine dramatically reduces likelihood death. isn’t difficult calculus. getting vaccine could result getting sick &amp; dying getting sick spreading virus someone else subsequently dies. getting vaccine could result death now. 

The fetal cell lines fetus aborted decades ago. Nearly every modern medicine tested cells. testing saved countless lives. It’s unlike post-mortem organ donation saves lives. 

So one hand, save lives now. hand, people die now. think know one support.  Damage already done. vaccination rate age bracket abysmal. rely people vaccinated prevent getting measels, mumps potentially deadly viruses. fact someone good health refuses puts others like risk. selfishness speaks volumes. almost feel bad getting laid masses... Almost. Newsflash: never god. somethingsomething5g I’m thinking reason half dose moderna protection 6 months two shots still pretty good. Maybe data found protection level half dose full dose boosters didn’t yield massive difference they’ll go lower dosage hopes negate nasty side effects. remember reading months back moderna recipients experienced worse side effects frequently Pfizer/J&amp;j recipients.

Edit: yes I’m pretty sure CDC approved half dose booster everyone receive that. lot city jobs used hire waiting lists. I'd imagine quite waiting take jobs problem mandate. womp womp? Wish include chip provide paper's enter places require it. Would much easier people getting boosters *can*, recommended get booster? went checklist weeks ago see get booster said need one I'm exposed large groups people regularly, I'm long-term care center work long term care center.

And, I'm also happy carry spread message ""Stop bitches antivaxxers"". I'm licking doorknobs. I'm vaccinated live area requires masks indoors follow rules.

I think know like care small children, especially sick. nothing ""brief"" interaction. Covid basically time gotten sick get it. decidedly good news west buy 50% doses. means low-income countries A. Lose lot vulnerable people B. spawn new variants potentially mess everyone's vaccine coverage globally.

Well turns incorrect, read article wrong.

Plenty people getting boosters, including myself. Fire, jail, ban state jobs. That’s works. agree, severe cases, US medicine overly expensive. Right kind inbetween ""can"" ""should"". booster provides far less benefit, since protection death held well protection hospitalization held decently. hand, booster still provide benefit, since protection infection waned quite bit booster really seems help well touch protection hospitalization.

If someone shares mindset FDA CDC thing care hospitalization death, hard choice benefits risks small. hand, someone worried long COVID, getting sick almost need go hospital, vulnerable way likely breakthrough case, want protection get try avoid spreading someone vulnerable live with, easy choice benefits significant.

The FDA CDC tried capture difference two groups eligibility list, IMO done poor job really eligible everyone recommended certain age severe health conditions (instead health conditions 80% people have). $180,000 think we’re point many people refuse get vaccinated they’ve decided rest us best protect plague bearing lions

What weak snake. doubtful ever reach herd immunity. many people need vaccinated, effectiveness vaccines wain time variants. Eventually, get booster year.

No, hospitals overflowing places. locations low vaccination rates problems, part hospitals fine. unvaccinated also develop immunity infected recovering, ones recover less likely get again.

I really believe people ruining society continue think covidf dangerous. not. Get vaccinated safe stop worrying live completely normal life. probably likely killed auto accident covid. choose vaccinated, you.

For me, really think covid except getting sucked reddit conversation. vaccinated, over. never wear mask temporarily moved location almost one wears masks. wonderful. need try same. guarantee feel better. Got mine. different 😐   everything I'm looking researching right now, highest figure HIV AIDS deaths since beginning pandemic 36 million. thought Spanish Flu killed 50 million people. also talking span 40 years hiv-aids span 3 years Spanish flu. Either way, comfortable numbers.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

One deadly diseases modern history half people get vaccinated mUh RiGhTs - stupid fucks. get vaxxed 95% 6 months one 92 47 get booster 92%. don’t get Quality Healthcare human righ---- hahahahaha, capitalism says fuck no. lmao aka arbitrary ass numbers

i don’t get it’s hard say “we recommend shot” instead pulling random figure ass include indirect Covid deaths? Like, best friend decided getting chemo treatments beginning pandemic afraid going hospital exposed Covid low white blood cell count. tumor grew result, ultimately died cancer. It’s 3 comes 4 5 followed 6…..  Got booster 3 weeks ago, sore arm day. Get boosters can! major religion said vaccines, even ones somehow used fetal cells, religious beliefs grant right/ability harm others.

Actually, incorrect too. beliefs need part organized religion. need sincere religious nature.

From previous protections apply whether religious beliefs practices question common non-traditional, regardless whether recognized organized religion.

So even personal religion invented, protected as, say, Catholicism.

The likely reason said first post- accommodations compromise workplace's safety need accepted. Since pandemic, getting vaccinated puts employees risk hospital also puts patients risk. 

This kind exception pretty standard civil rights laws. refuse hire someone disability want bus driver seizure disorder - kinds exceptions world would bonkers. fourth? read latest study...they said booster brings efficacy back 93 94% hospitalization severe disease know long last many times say *hope* enough. *Hope* something see, measure.

**Less hope actions people**. gotten vaccine, everyone's sake.

I'm sick hope.  wife working Hungary several months lockdowns started happening, access US vaccines. foreign worker country, also last line vaccines available there. gotten two Asta shots back US. way convert Hungarian vaccination card CDC accepted format? would need restart vaccinations CDC approved brands US? Yes, although hospitalisation rate fatality rate closely related. Anything brings one likely bring down.

Additionally, better therapies mean even people *do* go hospital, stay long.  Moderna said getting half dose.

I immune compromised overweight work public close Agreed. went thinking mind matter um...it wasn't. Thanks delta, assured everyone going get immunity sooner later, probably sooner.

People anti-vax get immunity hard way, first infection (which, cases, happen within next months), they'll similar protection vaccinated people. Why’s everyone making big deal 99% people keep jobs? /s Arkansas. ask require proof. think they’re happy somebody wants vaccinated  lol Yes, Brasil professionals pretty much excited positive future too, really hoping new complicated variants surge fuck everything again. crazy different process Belgium.

Well, thoughts antivaxxers even want 1st jab ?  Could worse. Nice assumption. I'm American.

However, someone knows 8,000 people get virus, going die. Unless China invented miracle cure told anyone. I’m curious think take decades years. respiratory virus pandemics ended couple years max. 

Prior infection provide protection reinfection. It’s much dangerous health getting vaccinated, resulting immunity similar.  end hospital

what count hospital? like actually admitted? wife covid pregnant went hospital twice extra caution cuz breathing got little harder didnt stay night tests monitoring  ask ID case, vaxx card NO!!!?? BOOSTER INCLUDES BIOS UPDATE BILL GATES CHIP. Vaccines + Outdoor environment. Leeeets go, super ready COVID thing teach kids class. 

This pandemic fucked mental health deep, damaging ways. getting therapist first time 35 years life deal anxiety getting common cold. sick all. Sick us other's throats. Curious see data NhL games well. Indoor, cold environment distancing. works well, it’s basically proof events fine vaccination. wouldn’t even say stop significant health threat. flu significant health threat elderly every year, it’s constant pandemic. pandemic end, uncontrolled, global spread end, rapidly approaching. Vaccines make process less deadly it’s happening one way another. got vaccine (Moderna) wait longer 15 minutes observation everyone else got allergic penicillin. observed 30 minutes visit. First breeze. Second dose weather couple days. allergy reaction problems though.    Yes, saying people need personal responsibility get vaccinated. don't, take risk. let people choose smoke die allow companies make cigarettes profit people's death. certainly allow people take covid risk. really affect make bad decision. hospital operations return normal state.

That would indicator, yes. country (Austria), that's going happen many years many anti-vaxxers - essentially die away get vaccination rate high enough hospitals operate normal level again. might take decades. country special. many countries well.   Yeah that's messed up. work food plant Canada strict covid protocols 2020 including screener temp checks every morning entering Employees also faded discipline caught lying screeners coming sick I'm susceptible blood clots think j j point time worth risk moderna decent coverage 2 doses risk it. pops do. system separates hot/new/controversial.

Consult doctor get shots people like go grocery store, OK!  spent tons money resources come vaccine. also pledged donate half billion doses countries, country. also countries vaccines donating more.

I understand saying, reality balance world diverse.

Good know! Thanks. lie. straight said I'm healthy high risk criteria; wanted booster. places willing give boosters anyone meets vaccination criteria. totally understand respect desire things right way; wanted make clear there's sketchiness necessary.

Wait find way politicize used America, Covid-19 welcomed open arms half government half people much spread totally fine 100's even 1000s people dying every day they're old overweight people they're contributing GDP enough anyway.

Freedom means death suffering! Hooray!

/S I've heard get higher dose immunocompromised. would make sense would confirm that.

They confirm occupational eligibility however (Oregon).  headline bit puzzling. ""nationwide paid holiday"" hardly something government ""imposes"" (as something negative). would correct say ""granted"". 

But aside, learned anything pandemic, hope learned paying people stay home good strategy. Circuit breaker lockdowns work wonders, long people comply, they're much likely comply still pay rent keep food table, think people enjoy pandemic want hang it.  What’s amazed last year live industry I’m (construction engineering) would literally know Covid exists anymore. Nobody mentions cares. wife RN largest hospital live longer considered major issue. Staffing biggest problem currently. 

I turn TV, login Reddit, travel NY CA it’s entirely different world reality.

Disclaimer context, got vaccine DAY eligible.  need certain percentage population vaccinated pandemic stop ravaging country, enough people getting vaccinated. Misinformation vaccines rampant many people don’t want get it, they’re crazy, exposed tons misinformation it, don’t feel like getting don’t understand pandemic fully, reason. states level vaccinations low there’s clear present danger pandemic would last years years many people dying. 

How suppose fix issue without mandating vaccines? We’re already seeing mantle working weeding antivaxxers public places, thus saving many others them.

What you’re essentially saying you’d rather hundreds thousands unnecessary deaths rather mandate vaccine. I’m sure you’d think differently pay price. think comment saying?

I'm saying Catholics agree Pope. mean exactly don’t know claim religious exemption pope himself, appointed successor Saint Peter, says get vaccinated.

How many sects there? Even Catholicism? 

How many religions identify Christians?

 Either undermine challenge legitimacy Papacy, get fucking vaccinated.

Why would stop anyone?

There Catholics believe Pious XII last legitimate Pope, like Americans think true [Leader* avoiding automod] since 1860s.

You follow leader buy they're selling.

This likely legitimate source many Catholics right choosing get vaccinated. going snowball bunch fundamentalist buy Mark Beast business.

I say person faith myself: faithful known reasonableness. It’s amazing people seem hate people enjoying lives again.  Got right. Plus NASCAR summer.   confirm. Literally walked in, told pharmacy want shot gave one. Came back two weeks later thing second one. patent factor. SSRIs old news. Doctors even know work psychiatric illness, guessing. fact covid-19 kills people mental illness much higher clip people extremely fascinating must studied. must genetic vulnerability people likely medications already.  good reason universal health care. nonprofits help get affordable access drugs.  Well 93% number gave hospitalizations.

And said 1% people screened positive. 

I know actually means immunity side, sound stellar.   Getting booster soon! Woohoo. needed good news don’t care New York. know guy whose mother came Columbia visit weeks got double vaccinated here. one cared foreign passport. keep mask run grocery store way home work. look like idiot driving alone car n95? Yes. spend extra 5 minutes tweaking fit get grocery store five minutes away? Nope!  want disagree want say.
Just post badly worded hard understand mean. Georgia, went Flu shot noticed lot pretty healthy people age getting boosters. went CVS next day got booster. 
NOW, happened next sucked ass booster got ~6 months 2nd shot.. really kicked ass. in, ""I think may COVID"" bad, nasty fever, watch said went AFIB 2 days (who knows if's accurate super dizzy) feel 100% again. think prob b/c got flu shot, pneumonia vaccine covid booster 2 days.  Still glad got though. Literally got booster waiting 15 minutes. pharmacy accepting walk ins. 

They care need third dose booster since different doses. checkbox form saying one need. ""Allows"" may bit misleading may mistake Supreme Court ruling mandates constitutional.  live Northern Virginia able walk pop vaccination clinic last Friday get Moderna booster shot problem. husband got yesterday. line, waiting. Little bit? Honestly life almost completely back normal large swaths country months now. Religion increasingly becoming excuse antisocial. Thanks, appreciate it. Sometimes feel like thread upvoting sometimes disagreeing little stuff. actually delta+ ravaged Southern states earlier, lowest infection rates country currently.

I got booster SC yesterday... ID required, questions asked besides DOB confirm identity. Plenty doses got day sought out, empty appts filled  welcome. wish good luck good health. :) see there. : ) I'd like hear anyone who's original two shots Pfizer serious prolonged reaction second shot, got Pfizer booster. eligible booster late November (six months since second shot) want get significant reaction first shot horrible prolonged reaction second. sidelined day fever (102.3), chills fatigue basically expected, week-long reaction included severe kidney liver pain, constant intense shooting pains legs, brain fog cognitive impairment bad would often type sentence look realize made sense all. 

I ultimately recover fully believe third shot probably ""worth it"" I'd really like hear people experienced similar situations.   pharmacy. Seriously.

I got J&amp;J March, Walgreens gave Pfizers summer. Bless them. Got moderna January / Feb (am healthcare worker, California). J&amp;J last week. didn’t verify almost anything except moderna 6 months ago. 

Definitely kicked butt next day (chills aches) glad gotten it. I'd rather option available needed, needed available. Yes, would upsetting not. nothing suggest otherwise.

Their media goes wild 100 cases day everything goes strict lockdown way less.

They rigourous testing place. region active outbreaks get flagged yellow PCR test within 3 days allowed anywhere.

If outbreak gets big, pool tests entire cities single day. Like quick freeze, one allowed till get test result.

China absolutely control COVID, that's sure.

The question controling disease worth living authoritarian nightmare. information coming out, difficult take individual doctor's recommendation vaccine. may true several years ago necessarily true now. I'm glad see outdoor events appear major sources spread. little bit getting back normal win. feel pain. I'll cross fingers ya. definitely anti vaxxer. booster, you? sad attitude seems buy whole program must everything. thought sincere, clearly wrong.

My attitude needed get past this. listen experts, hard keep change opinions ever days. People return normal life. cost lives? know, say certainty way places like bay area handling pandemic causing harm benefiting community. wonder guy days. He’d like 80 I’m sure he’s enjoying retirement! Yea think free everyone been!

/s anyone thinks necessary significantly 5 million, obviously changes survival north 19 million covid deaths worldwide. I’m hopefully eventually Xi’s policies bite back, fact China enough domestic production demand step outside global sphere bit still fine. 

And Xi starting put next Mao, knows whether anyone question him, rain shine. pregnant, covid previously, parents strong reactions vaccines, deciding whether worth get vaccinated pregnant? Guess what, two billion double protection one billion, saying better necessarily mean trade worth it.    certainly many variables play. That’s used large sample size. compared large sample size another sample population equal size similar demographics. went this. Try keep CDC says can’t get yet I’m high risk. true, old info? Southern states much less densely populated insinuation isn’t correct Yeah, that's still huge. 1 5. Think that. standing line store. Someone line (or cashier) probably antivaxxer. kid sitting school. 4 5 kids class come antivaxxer families.

In reality, that's entirely accurate though. There's lot clustering antivaxxers. places, probably like 9 10 antivaxxers, other's like 1 20. still, matter go, probably got least 1 somewhere around you. used think fringe people run often. anymore. nice supreme court used explain decisions

Uh... pretty much never rejecting emergency appeal. like decision merits explain. quick look SCOTUS website shows take 100-150 cases 7000+ appeals year -- explaining refused take every single one would incredibly infeasible. I'm curious y'all spin gotta say lawsuits teeth it. arm pain shots. side effects whatsoever. even headache. wonder second shot Moderna fuck even though pharmacist literally said likely give fever. thinking imbalanced world richer countries rolling sleeves 3rd dose others around would can’t get first. 

We seen variants emerge densely populated unvaccinated countries. It’s therefore world’s best interest ensure vaccinate across globe. It’s race need stay ahead Covid. 200 million donated doses impressive. Thank USA. hope reach 1 + billion doses needed.  I'm sure come Roe goes.before court months. Wake Tolbs. Read study, headlines. I'm saying vaccines bad, I'm saying 100% certainty CDC misleading public headline. Publix awesome, wait better got J &amp; J clinic March got flu shot 2 weeks ago. line, super clean, quick give shot, really nice around positive experience. interrogation. first guy cured HIV also died recently. think last year cancer related causes. You’re child. Don’t act like one. long Covid exists something hearing months/years come. sayin  and/or contact tracing isn’t working Bone marrow transfusions resulted ""cures"" some--is refering Phe mi nal. social stigma risk behaviours spread hiv far outweighs stigma behaviours spread covid seems little weird sign anything. emailed county health, said husband work ag six months since last shot, live work high risk settings, eligible? emailed back quickly said eligible included link make appointment. 

At drive clinic check anything, consent forms vaccine cards.  pediatricians allocated doses first (especially limited cold storage capacity), rate, EUA give pediatricians ability give vaccine -- okayed CDC. ACIP meets Tuesday discuss it, Director Walensky make recommendation Wednesday so, point vaccine administered. means Covid, even Delta , indoors poor ventilation I've banana test half face full face respirator. stuff handy, make sure I'm fully shaved, mask flat skin way around, ""puff test"" break seal.

Huh. get Isoamyl Acetate ampules Amazon. Imagine that. Well lost reflective covid, don’t think I’ll pretend like doesn’t exist. want live alternate reality that’s you, hopefully won’t kill many people terrible attitude. 

And don’t believe claim you’re anti vaxxer. someone claims take seriously sure spout lot dangerous misinformation covid vaccines. hey, listen experts childish nonsense already believe in, right? safeway store... fill on-line form, say job category check vax card counter go vaccine area get shot. actually work health. really checked on-line form ID...nothing else. lol, article doesn’t negate fact many variables play anyone come accurate percentage No, think misread OP's post, talking regular vaccine. think it, might misread whole thread lol.  explain article you’re commenting even bother read. explain research works. You’ll excuse holding intelligence low regard. That's thinking. Especially since court martialing anyone. people really want easy way it. could get general discharge go home get vaccinated uncle Sam would none wiser. feeling including BMI 25 mental health issues like depression anxiety also way dramatically expanding access without directly calling everyone get boosters, given government's continued hesitancy explicitly.  Early 2022! But, Gospel Fake History demands stand tall!!! It’s stupid short sighted. kind attitude alienate Dems voters need. Thanks jdorje! California. know sent vaccine info doctor CA, I'm sure anything file state. looks like state office vaccination records weekend hours, may try call today get clarity. Aaaand lose even chance widening Democratic tent. 

Let’s see plays black voters Latino voters Jewish voters. 

But least lose knowing brain biggest. like religious people also phenomenal scientists. Like flu? Gasp! Another anti vax excuse blown water  also forgetting baseball thousands games happening since May opened full capacity.  Respectfully, disagree due misleading. skew numbers many misleading ways. one, talk total numbers go straight odds ratio. methods test... 100,000 people went hospital vaccinated prior infection, 10,000 people tested positive, that's 10%. TWO people went hospital unvaccinated prior infection, one test came back positive, that's 50%. Therefore comes conclusion: ""A study hospitalized patients symptoms similar Covid-19 found unvaccinated people previous infection 5x likely positive Covid-19 test compared unvaccinated people. Get vaccinated ASAP""

If read study(which find hard believe have), several ways skew results, wrote easiest explain. 

I truly shocked CDC.  Natural immunity lasts mere months infection. Vaccines needed ongoing resistance. mother TRIPLE vaccinated won’t go outdoor Halloween party tomorrow. bet ptsd attitude. 

Disclosure: I’m fully Pfizer’d getting booster next week want behind us.  Replying earlier, removed post debunking. there’s slight truth behind this, lot hurt feelings credit given. I’m inclined give anyone appears Bannon’s podcast benefit doubt. 

Yes, vaccines aren’t quite perfect, like say measles drive r-0 18 virus near zero transmission. they’re damn good. create positive pressure, supply limited absolutely go vulnerable populations. Unfortunately doesn’t seem likely meaningfully redirected (and unfortunately anti vax propaganda sprouting worldwide, including Africa) really doesn’t need addition supply issues oversupply 1st world countries.

As is, unvaccinated* far likely spread catch delta, they’re ones they’re generally worst offenders helping Covid mutate providing opportunity (*excluding can’t yet get vaccinated, like kids). 

Then it’s highly risk population, can’t mount strong response even 2-3 doses, good Petri dishes evolution weakened ‘training’ environment. 

Then there’s rest us. I’ve seen immunity approximately 95% resistant getting base Covid extended exposure. 7+ months I’m probably 60-80% extended exposure delta, still highly likely get asymptomatic mild case clear quickly get delta. 

A booster brings back 95% again. strictly needed? No. Would get one thought way stealing someone first 2 categories anywhere world? No, I’d wait least 12 months guidance studies. I’ve read we’ve got doses going waste around country, it’s arm expired bin, I’ll choose arm. lmao @ automoderator removing “b l c k e r” sure think asymptomatic cases (typically unobserved) relevant  John Paul II future Benedict XVI signed use vaccines used embryonic stem cells production given alternatives. Same. IL covid even slightly worse is, even able debate. Every western society would mandate citizens law, offenders punished jailed. made think ‘long covid’. Found months declaration COVID-19 pandemic, new symptom patterns syndromes ‘long COVID’ emerging. patterns may explained autonomic instability may result deconditioning, hypovolaemia immune- virus-mediated neuropathy. anticipate syndromes represent large proportion primary secondary care consultations coming months. Clinicians must aware prompt correct diagnosis careful management essential recovery.” York's mandate forces abominable choice New York healthcare workers: abandon faith lose careers,""

What religion abandoning here? Patriot Church, established September 2020? Funny people got vaccinated kids, got kids vaccinated, many get flu shot every year, suddenly developed religious objection vaccination last six months.  “The participants matched demographic, geographic health characteristics related serious illness, well health status behavioral issues.”

Read article. 

Yes, covid affects everyone differently. That’s researchers use large sample size. Say, 730,000 people example.

I’m sure think asymptomatic cases relevant. numbers reflect percentage hospitalization death due covid (an observable outcome), rate infection. Though article mention decrease positive tests result third shot. would know actually read article.

To put simply, you’re idiot. immunization seems last long enough. far looks need better vaccines (which would effectively sterilize individual). Keep mind long lasting effects, related Long Covid, removing lot manpower economy. need second technology boost. Many great things work, thankfully - countries become unable use next generation vaccines antiviral treatments economies initial phase pandemic? I'm afraid economy crisis, could lead devastating consequences. remember early pandemic got called science denier sorts awful names saying wearing mask outside stupid. said closing hiking stupider got told didn’t GeT ScIeNcE!

I admit petty part feels vindicated, it’s obnoxious much policy driven irrational desires assuage worry rather logical risk calculus. Thanks bud. Everyday breath little easier. girls still 5, bit long anxiety me. otherwise, signed boosters wife I. thing every time get ""regular"" sick, anxiety, fear, panic sets 110%. mental problem developed ... call PTSD, certainly triggering panic / hypochondria disorder. We'll get there. Aren’t also working mRNA shot HIV? LOL got booster yesterday. don’t unvaccinated think Jake Tapper Neil Cavuto trash. Everytime we've moved new stage Ontario last months met posts complaints we'll lockdown end next month. literally never happened since got high vaccination rate cases even dropping despite full capacity stadiums . volunteer vaccinator winter. Seriously, people know theM

Thank that, thank much  I'm going get 4th booster next week hopes sharpen spidey sense.  Vaccination rocket science. actually lot harder rocket science. ;) kinda think people engage public anymore pandemic fear somewhat desire see gathering result major outbreak semblance jealousy. Everyone celebrating fact vaccinated, outdoor events safe. Crazy it? Florida actually, compared rest US, pretty good shape. Well mean, I'm right. amount people jailed, disappeared, silenced would tell much. else would massive firewall? However, would believe say something wrong. probably learned lesson. much mixed messaging. I've seen official reports saying people antibodies short time also heard anecdotal reports same.

 quite small cohort probably reasonably high viral load. worry people who've prior infections get vaccinated they're protected think. Got Pfizer booster yesterday afternoon. It’s kicking ass like second one asked ID appointment. highly doubt would turn away anyone booster point. appointment tied existing pharmacy account, I'm sure type information provide detailed would one. *did* know, based records, however, condition would qualified receive booster. exception being, possibly, per year two course oral corticosteroid.  Curious severe second third go arounds average. getting less severe kick can, blood clots....

The long term data virus going be......interesting morbid kind way.  I'm sure everyone internet saying lots nice stuff too. Must feel good. Lack 3rd doses means partially vaccinated people getting infected selecting mutants escape vaccine immunity spreading virus others. fully vaccinating people short-sided lead variants evolving rich countries spreading partially vaccinated people poorer countries making boosters work one. 

You engage variant speculation either way. talking cutting people's antibiotics short give partial dose others well, think would contentious leads variants. need silly excuses variants justify giving people part vaccination help save lives. Thank man, takes load least it’s something it’s like balls nailed wall Wait, talking good AIDS bad AIDS?     Lol, guy posting garbage reddit. brave! vaccinations, probably work healthcare sector, religion nothing it.  definitely something, possibly even effect. 

Inhaling nose carries air filter. may catch particulates droplets though, aerosols.

But exhaling mouth way worse nose. Simple breathing many times less viral load delivered (per least one study) talking, less singing coughing. mouth-only mask blocks that. 

If six months, get third dose today.  100% qualify occupation clause.  So? exactly comparable. learned years ago someone adequately treated HIV newer drugs, normal life expectancy viral load undetectable pass along sex giving birth anymore, amazed. death sentence within lifetime incredible.  starters, vaccinated individuals catch covid too. Please

Only small minority has. Hell put group vaccinated people room together without face masks, catching covid pretty much guaranteed. Please don’t allude COVID disinfo can’t

You spreading misinformation, Florida caught multiple time covering actual currently safest state country terms covid positivity rate.

[A quick google search shows Florida number 10. Connecticut currently number plus New York behind Florida Califorina number 3 much like Florida states pretty much filter weak unsurprising 3rd populated state 3rd COVID deaths. surprising you?

Considering average person Florida fucking dumbass can't shit right, surprised made top 3.  many people terrorists killed US compared covid? 

and jump many hoops travel that, yet people get shot wear mask covid, much deadlier?
 
-----------

Hint: 1000 people died COVID **a single day** US (4327) total died terrorist attacks since 1995 ---COMBINED (3393)   live rural New York Moderna booster pharmacy grocery store today. Made appointment online week ago, showed up, filled form gave without questions.     I'm happy pandemic happened. demonstrated governments act swiftly strongly deal issue - start dealing issue climate change without excuse ""*no, cannot take strong measures, bad economy*"".       Yes. even so, think stadiums open fans. big spikes traced back them. Anti-boosters wrecked  Exactly.  Yeah. know this. difference is, vaccinated rarely end hospital, rarely die. unvaccinated end hospital taking valuable resources. 9 10 patients hospital Covid unvaccinated. It’s facts.  Taking ""fact"" without context bad misinformation.

... Florida 37th deaths per capita, avg 126 daily deaths per official covid data. **It good**     Hey teacher sad question asking but, mouth covered mask good reducing transmission? 

Obviously ask 5 times per 48 min instructional time worn covering mouth nose all.

The problem battle lost diligent mask wearing, essentially zero high schoolers exercise day-long proper mask wearing.

100% fail avoid close proximity students wearing masks incorrectly.

Our administrators don’t want put jobs line bringing consistent serious consequences serial non compliance way stir radicalized school board.

A kid won’t keep mouth covered removed room can’t much majority noses even though think it’s important be

I’m talking pediatrician getting classified high-exposure see go get Moderna dose 3. 

400 mask kids Halloween assembly taking half gym’s bleachers 30 mins category horse paste eaters?
A) People reading headlines taking word.
B) People read study, look numbers, easily conclude CDC purposefully misleading public. 1A require employer accommodate. statutory thing (eg ADA) I'm sure missed it, place see cause death year year? I'm curious stacks sugar-related deaths alcohol-related deaths. clear, get double triple vaxxed get yearly boosters wear masks; I'm curious lines causes death statistics perspective.  appointment two penicillin allergy people getting doses. wait 30 minutes. 


When made appointment kinda weird made appointment husband time given different locations (CVS). Mine hometown next town (5 minutes away). Apparently CVS hometown taking special watch patients CVS taking people preconditions. husband wait 15 minutes. think got hit little harder second dose did. 


...and yes, science awesome ;) Interestingly, deaths stopped going Florida. Sounds like cases can't trusted.  seems vary. suppose take several tries.  Whoosh  Moderna is. somehow make antibody levels high enough kill virus get toehold T-cells.

That won’t easy. 100% IS


just like Abbott Texas


because florida stupid Texas (i live TX)

they'll get re-elected.  Husband got boosters today! We’re 6 months Pfizer shots work travel media, we’re set lots people regularly, traveling heavily, take tons covid tests.

Made choice get testing positive would fuck work life, even we’re zero percent worried personal health level (youngish, healthy, strong immune systems constant travel).

Every time take covid test there’s always slight worry of, “could test positive?” Glad reduce chances significantly. Depends talking about. Reduction efficacy preventing transmission probably wane first, protection infection. course clue Protection hospitalization death probably wane much all. 3 months since started boosting Israel, may able get data waning effectiveness preventing transmission couple months (does mean get data). Infection rate data probably months could potentially get data. I've seen before, great refresher. Especially see retrospect:

March 2, 2020. 92 US Cases

Trump: ""They're going vaccines relatively soon""

His crowd cheers

Oh times changed. recall correctly, Florida also highest aggregate cases per capita since Aug 1.

There several ways get community immunity. letting wave go unimpeded high vaccination rates widespread masking costly deaths long-term disability. vaccines staying time being. reason target S-protein virus binds human ACE2 receptor. receptor like lock door. try improve key much fits perfectly. would delta variant. virus would appear, m-rna production process could adapted within weeks.

In conclusion, headline raising unnecessary fears. Click-bait. ""Nearly 75% people age 20 overweight, according CDC.""

The thin 25% probably thinking keep dieting exercising? wait booster probably end getting drafted case WW3 breaks unlike 75%. solid chance anyone vaccinated either dead caught it.   Friday, 10/29: 8,078 new cases last two days 122 deaths. average 4,039 new cases Thurs. Fri. (MI reports M, W, F now.)

I started keeping track every Friday starting Oct. 1st.

Here's trend:

10/1: 2,597 new cases/42 deaths

10/8: 4,205/82

10/15: 8,297/104 (about 4,149 avg.)

10/22: 7,505/118 (about 3,752 avg.)

This Friday's avg 4,039 new cases two days.

The case average well 100,000 per million many urban rural counties Michigan yesterday. see here:  map scroll around over.

I uncertain MI made articles cases trending last two weeks. bit, situation, IMO, still pretty volatile right one thinking ""Oh, over."" 93% reduction relative 2-doses (5+ months 2nd dose). IIRC 2nd doses effectiveness hospitalization wane much, still 80-90% even 5 months. 93% reduction remaining risk means 99% reduction hospitalization 3 doses compared \~90% 2 doses. bring efficacy back up... makes much better.   Moderna loses effectiveness lot slower Pfizer keep protected better longer  tobacco industry sued decades ago misinformation kill people. People choosing kill tobacco, heroin, cocaine, fast-food diet high red meat leading heart disease; yes personal choices. Arguably people get pleasure self-destructive choices. difference people actively trying get covid even benefiting getting Covid. beyond anyone's personal choice even benefit anyone all. So, society makes sense eradicate something net value.  Agreed   not. That's frustrating watching US. doesn’t mean contact tracing actually working.

I’ve seen plenty instances notifications happen days contact. Folks aren’t exactly inclined self report either , especially amateur events Last year NFL apparently gave lot access experts contact trace among players, recall poor ventilated indoor areas worst, especially people bunched together them. That’s  wrong, worldwide new doses dropped 1/3, we're making doses ever - 1.6 billion month now. First doses absolutely valuable, letting doses go unused good all.   N95 block that. relevant much better respirator uses organic vapor  Well, understand saying correctly not?    boosters available day CDC approved it.

Violence default response. That's interesting, people say got flu vaccine, got vaccine within week got flu. UK yet hit 1,100 hospital admissions entire wave. Back January, hit 4,000.

Also, even unvaccinated affected this, people willingly choosing let get virus end overflowing hospitals, taking beds could gone people need (for issues, covid). unvaccinated people=more preventable deaths prevented. They’re also overworking healthcare workers exposing covid higher rates, also hurts sick people. basically destroying healthcare system feel like it. 

This matter personal choice, everyone danger here. nothing like cigarettes (although I’d argue second hand smoking smokers also hurting people themselves, whatever), movement people actively destroying society killing millions reason. *only* way prevent unnecessary death suffering vaccine mandates. people don’t like it, though shit. important.  never thought airborne virus would deadlier STD. I'm going best answer without getting automodded:

Vaccination natural immunity may able stop virus spreading, make lethal flu (and maybe even less, people repeated exposures), stops pandemic.

I would add another consideration - hospital operations return normal state. means COVID patients longer spilling doorways.

Edit: Let's hope get sometime near future, sake needing health care sake sanity providing it. Gotcha. Yeah that’s basically websites say. haven’t heard anyone wants one getting turned away. long you’re 6 months last shot. 

I’m right six months now, haven’t scheduled yet.   Awesome thank niece allergic almost everything double vaccinated. family joke cannot use pogo stick allergic it. we’re relaxing precautions holidays. Case rate 25% past 14 days. Positivity rate rising too. It’s sad. CDC guidelines got mine wanted know qualifications signed notice said met special qualifications. 

It literally never come due HIPAA regulations, guidelines here: links see reasons would want consider booster. 

I basically back Feb qualified medical exemption back too. ID? show foreign ID I'd tourist there. I'd love visit NY again... Last time 15 years ago. seems petty unprofessional extreme light many deaths importance keeping people well. meanwhile large amounts unused vaccines trashed. Booster gets 5G+ 33% higher speeds. Im either categories, able get shot relatively quickly; due fact happen one lovely communities hoax anyways one gets 🙃. 

Ill check, thank *Florida entered chat Thank you, I'll try find information local subreddits. last dose 3.5 months ago guess we'll see December.  Perfect summary situation 👍  That’s great. gained COVID-19lbs back track. don’t want anyone think vaccine replacement healthy lifestyle come NY! We’ve got plenty spare slightly overweight? mild depression? sorts things let qualify 3rd shot like 90% Americans qualify. google city name Covid booster

It’s basically recommended highest risk groups age/comorbidities first lower age groups jobs put risk high access public get it. Fauci helped HIV effort I’m 20s healthy don’t want lie? would rather wait til I’m allowed get it.  shortage hopefully vulnerable also getting theirs. qualified. hope it’s open general public soon.  would prefer lie get immediately approved. I’m healthy young don’t want get I’m supposed to. Well sounds like doomed shit decades. Vaccines failing natural immunity means nothing.   I’m working friend. easy everyone CICO, unfortunately working it.

I’m 15lbs since 2019 that’s lot me.  I. Talked friend who's PA, talked boss PhD human biology. I'm getting booster.  said asthma smoker pavilions gave booster yesterday. don’t smoke used 2 years ago. didn’t really ask. Also got flu shot arm. bed dying watching majoras mask playthrough youtube could, going Southern state carries risk infection. Maybe try Northern state low infection rate high vaccination rate? know ID. Go schedule appointment near specific vaccine already had: Average age Africa = 19.7 years

Average age India = 28.4 years

Average age US = 38.1 years. 

Average age UK = 40.4 years

This is, likely, largest contributor deaths US UK countries mentioned.  says 94% compared 2 doses, 94% Delta. Pfizer RCT showed 90-99% range symptomatic infection. efficacy 88% ever measured delta 2 doses substantial improvement regardless 2- dose symptomatic efficacy waned to.

Get third dose six months.  Ehh..they similar thing SB nothing eventful took place. super spreader event microscopic world can't intuited, surprising lot misconceptions masks work. One thing that's hard people understand masks successfully filter nanometer size particles. Scroll Figure 1. Diffusion effects take little thinking through.  redditor r/dallas would say would happen anytime new death stats came out.

and totally right.   admittance defined hospitalized 12 hours. Mostly think let patients stay one night even monitoring Denmark.  true

dallas lowered covid threat notch first time since remember.  Aight story time, I’m healthcare worker got vaccine twice around late January early February. went trip Philippines last month, stayed 3 weeks, met lot family/friends/random periods vaxxed unvaxxed *vaccine kinda hard get there* anyways, stayed covid free whole trip. I’m glad I’m vaxxed lol.  large chain , they’ll definitely getting it. thought would plan place shots go immediately, yet. there’s nothing keep up, i’m curious doc martens taste

the study notes original two shots waning immunity

which compared booster shot came out, meaning didn’t time see numbers dwindle

i’m gonna sit point million variables didn’t even touch on

you keep believing every single thing read though got moderna booster monday texas. 
im 32. made appt. CVS. 

gave vaxx card got shot. checked ID. form. nothin Best wishes him, truly.    http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid19-data/covid19_data_latest.pdf   headline does. data might not. study, 6 times people hospitalized covid like illness vaccinated group, vs unvaccinated prior infection. Further, include results Jan 1 year include vaccinated 90 days. Well, hardly anyone vaccinated 90 days May year, hospitalizations window even include category. Yet still, 6 times people hospitalized vaxxed vs natural immunity. Therefore think study's numbers actually strengthens Israeli study. 

It's truly insane present headline, looking study's numbers. logic; 100,000 people hospitalized covid like symptoms vaxxed group, two hospitalized natural immunity group, 10,000 people tested positive 1 person tested positive group respectfully, conclusion would same...10% vs 50% ie 5x likely covid natural immunity.   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I add kids egg allergies since flu MMR grown chicken egg embryos- worried getting vaccines. fully vaccinated without anything typical side effects (mild fever, sleepy couple days, etc) - vaccines overall safe almost everyone! Science wonderful :)

Only one ever kicked ass Rabies Pre-exposure series (3 vaccine series). Second vaccine basically gave flu symptoms 3 days knocked out. amazing titers Rabies so...definitely worth (in field work animals required job). 

Anyways...went rant there. know places observed longer penicillin allergy history. But, like - problem mRNA vaccines!  Serious question: got Moderna two dose back April pregnant (April 4 weeks later second dose) -- question is...can get third dose PFIZER instead Moderna?

My husband, opposite question, got two Pfizer's back Feb/Mar - get MODERNA time?

Over quarter covid deaths 85+ range, nearly quarter 50-64, really old. Unless 18, playing covid playing fire, that's taking account death, crippling side effects. wish employers would require essay workers justify position reject vaccines.

Nothing like wearing half face HEPA respirator walking room they're using good aromatic solvent. Head rush! Walk out, change dual organic chemical / HEPA filters.  Considering nearly 100% elderly vaccinated, seem like big issue. 

What % people unable vaxxed immunocompromised? 

My big issue whole ""the kids key FINALLY slowing spread"". completely disagree. key would getting everyone 18+ fully vaccinated (which course going happen), would key. kids barely drop bucket.
