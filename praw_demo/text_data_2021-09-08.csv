I responded different comment looks like United putting employees approved exemptions leave COVID better handled (for non person-facing jobs) better testing sanitization.

I think they're trying respect peoples wishes also balancing safety. Shell lot gas station workers. publication regards immunology menstrual cycles- Ever heard Long-Covid? affects kids too. It‚Äôs deaths. Sleep tight.  Jehovah's witnesses, Christian scientists, probably Scientology. basic Baptists claiming nothing stand on. Texan here. Everything you‚Äôve written bullshit. vocal it? Biden held press conference day CDC made announcement, telling Americans could ""take masks smile.""  fuck granted religious exemptions first place? article: 

""Pilots, flight attendants, gate agents airport customer service agents interact customers granted exemptions return work ‚Äúonce pandemic meaningfully recedes,‚Äù United said, without specifying timeframe.

Other employees like mechanics dispatchers granted exemptions return work airline puts new testing measures, carrier said staff note. still determining safety measures office workers exemptions whether need come all.""

I'm taking mean employees dont get vaccinated approved exemption put leave safer work again. interesting approach balances safety personal choices. denied exemption though they'll fired get vaccine within certain timeframe.  Makes happier choosing J&amp;J April. Covid fall 2020 1 done looking booster.  That‚Äôs great unvaccinated people continue drag rest guys down, hospitals still overwhelmed, events get canceled, etc. don‚Äôt think things normal quite while. bet IL's numbers garbage record keeping. signed health records website first shot there. know couple people experience. Yeah, worked make sure day come.

Hope one hand shit see fills first.  Yep...they wear masks, wash hands / use disinfectant, attend large indoor gatherings. true... saccharine stabby   Im happy one disagreeing that. criticize Biden, even he's better Trump. Apologies reposting link did. see post putting mine together. Whats chances happening South? Good see logic common sense getting band back together. Due current outbreak India, I've reading Nipah virus. Pretty sure gets loose oughta it. üò¨ in: despite rules murdering people, people still murder people. Hutterites. least like this. Child protection step take custody ensure child receives care require.  get stated warning, experts discussing potential happened one month in. None epidemiologist virologist warned anyone this; discussed.

If someone asked patients die others month pandemic, would tell know respiratory infection, deduce comorbidities may be. mean would warned everyone comorbidities covid everyone; speculating time.

More couple comments seem almost annoyed simply recalling virologists explained back seem take stance ""this preventable."" No. Even Fauci said expected every American get back first wave vaccines then.

Even Delta variant eluding vaccines some, much worse 1st wave now. think people realize shitty feeling needing intubate, getting consent, etc realizing hospital another vent spare.  claiming science found individuals vaccinated COVID longer spread virus could link source? far I'm aware vaccine ever worked way. work reduce spread I'm aware prevent it. city (Seattle) 750,000 people today 106 positive tests ZERO new hospitalizations, state middle surge cases. tells much difference 70+ percent fully vaccinated rate makes compared 39.6. Actively encouraging it. need keep people proselytizing sure aren‚Äôt encouraging big families. probably pinned comment something mentioning article published reputable paper one ever replicated confirmed it. wanna fall sort behavior taking horse paste engaged believing whatever come across supports beliefs.      Damn good idea got there.  generally super regular skip period swine flu. think it‚Äôs body‚Äôs way saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get pregnant month, fight infection first‚Äù   Nope. Even Jehova's Witnesses supporting vaccination. Christian Science example.

Not even them. Meh, late, disinformation leads people correct action refuse accept true information works point. second dose usually better. It‚Äôs best wait 8-12 weeks though. know countries recommending 4 weeks tends end nasty side effects.  thank you! rough time sleeping last night arm. felt like got punched WWE wrestler haha. tooth aches gone already cant wait second dose. period 2 weeks late COVID vaccines. amount cramping/bleeding 3 times longer/more usual. irony... Well supreme court ruled aren‚Äôt actually obligated protect citizens.

Guess can‚Äôt surprised Portland cops won‚Äôt protect others getting vaccine. Still less two weeks‚Äô worth cases single elementary school district! I‚Äôm science show vaccinated still transmitted. science changed virus changed. misinformation. Beast breast completely right, admit confusing geography. someone never lived easy see would baffled. tell take Long Island Rail Road Jamaica Manhattan blow minds. Well go... getting hopes up.

My work, wave2.0, said could go maskless hit 70% vax rate. even brought nurse group administer site.

Never.even.hit.50%

So disappointing feel 14 million Americans still waiting guidance one. don‚Äôt see booster isn‚Äôt obvious though point, mixing mRNA many countries AZ first dose.

Here Canada AZ first, Pfizer second, booster Pfizer Friday, 3 months last one, due immunosuppressed (and bonus travel sometime future places still don‚Äôt recognize mixed vaccines knows things settle out). Expecting feel terrible third first two, hoping pleasantly surprised! Biden responsible maniacs won‚Äôt take vaccine? realize distrust masks, vaccine current president comes Trump, repeatedly said president unduly elected. I‚Äôm NYC infection rate falling steadily past week, hospitalization rates almost halved past couple weeks. bit sensationalist article. Second universal double-pneumonectomies.  Yep, CDC needs overhaul, don‚Äôt disagree. It‚Äôs still better without former maniac president meddling it. first reaction well. Perhaps helpful misinformation, misinformation nonetheless.

As others pointed out, perfect mirror (now invalidated) concerns raised around vaccines. also fits dissemination template see things like Operation Infektion. So, well administered misinfo, although direct mirroring sterility concern little nose, IMO. NY hit massive wave beginning pandemic learned treat it. Since time - last 1.5 years - NYC faired much better might work, tested petri dish -- worked great (but note many things work great petri dish), tested observational studies -- worked great (most people got better, note people get better matter what). tested tiny RCTs, seemed work ok. increased size RCTs, effect mostly disappears. tiny positive studies turned likely publication bias. one fairly large study outlier positive result, retracted fraud. thing is, compared placebo, strong signal ivermectin helps current standard care. There's cover-up, need it. going make get better. silver bullet. Take standard medicines Covid want get better.

Why craziness? probably Bolsonaro government Brazil decided basically turn ivermectin state religion. seeded picked contrarians countries. 4.2 million cases though children 17 under. isn‚Äôt considered emergency children.  Mirena worked great me, second one hopefully final one get everything stopped permanently. I'm sure something immune response could caused act up, especially track record 9 years working great me. Australian Prime Minister called pandemic WHO. plan already time announced it. relieved since watching since news broke Jan 22. immediately started taking temperatures airport. daughter school friends went China summer holidays. told self isolate 2 weeks. kids missed school. begged daughter go school since travel public transport. figured kids would stay home parents mortgages pay might think feel ok. asked science teacher said ""That virus China worry."" pharmacist knew would come here. 

The USA doubly disadvantaged. 1) looks arrived USA even declared China. well Washington scientist thought go back check tests flu back December/January. 2) seem anyone knowledgeable White House prepared give power health authorities. third thing number Americans trying get home planes stopped flying lots people crammed together.

Opportunities lost saddest thing conspiracy theorists became political instead health issue. 2021 is, nothing else, lacking hilarious irony.  warning!  Psh, people bleed eyes time, hospitals probably saying it‚Äôs Ebola/style virus bn00000.156 get money gubment ivermectin regular use humans while? one noticed yet? Don‚Äôt tell them!!!!! school gets therapies one. wearing mask big thing ask. Look IDEA act US see important. Shhh, lets keep quiet. religious exemptions. People allowed put others risk rag virus imaginary god says getting jab religion. Oh, mean 'idiots'

FTFY ;)

Thanks TLDR summary. appreciate ability chew marrow bone. also think seal little bit better. wife middle school teacher. Every time contract came up, shifted healthcare costs teachers reduced retirement benefits.
I recall conversation reducing benefits changing annual COLA increases troopers.   Hey, must voice back head, telling go back hide quarantine. bothersome weeks back, another round research make sure inadvertently killing children -- least, participation society killed back 2019. really, really hard get firm picture threat posed children right now, struggling sure. found [this finally put rest. kids alright. COVID us forever now, isn‚Äôt it? Thank goodness! I'm usually regular (28-29 days nose). four times I'd late, pregnant! Well, 2 weeks late first Pfizer dose, 3 weeks late second. :/  that‚Äôs going happen soon enough. COVID already spreading high schools. I‚Äôm sorry coming aggressive like that. Thank you‚Äôre doing, agree. I‚Äôm ready people stop taking folks like granted irresponsible health. went looking medrxiv, could find recent study reported results. interesting keep eye out.     ""This gives us best chance staying open, we've opened,"" said Dr. Robert Strang, province's chief medical officer health.    ""We want shut province again.""

East Idaho 60 percent Mormon. Yeah, I‚Äôm pretty sensitive chemical odor, leave Aura air hour first use. problem that. Remarkably comfortable, much cup shaped n95 models.

No ocular symptoms stay confined nose; lost smell taste, cough loss O2 saturation.  They‚Äôre fired, aren‚Äôt scheduled. 

I‚Äôm surprised airlines taking precautions. Come Upstate New York. prove theory wrong.it well month ago. That's erased now. control. Upstate New York well all. counties red category high transmission CDC standards. go anywhere here, different south west.  Yes. do. It‚Äôs going forever stop conflating two. Don‚Äôt forget people called Lollapalooza Chicago super spreader since brought 400k people, except‚Ä¶..that wasn‚Äôt super spreader either. 

Outside lot people vaccinated safe get it. you, care anymore - I'm going protect family , even start conversation I‚Äôm similar situation. last one March well. I‚Äôm leaving country delayed honeymoon Nov 1. think may go it. Thanks Fam! I'm achy, runny nose tired , plus headache.

Anti-vax theory based nonsense. Don‚Äôt waste time trying wrap mind around it.  lot people saying get science ivermectin. plausible reason think might effective so, how? **What's proposed mechanism?** mean there's proposed mechanism hell let's try high doses acyclovir least something involves virus. 

I'm salty people like ""well science settled"" -- ok, drug? would investigate anti-parasitic's effects virus? seem nothing other. can't imagine anyone would fund studies begin with. think realize big difference is. 2.2 -3.1 times less likely get Covid-19 vaccinated means 220%-310% likely get unvaccinated. Diabetic. susceptible eye infections (apparently uncommon among diabetics).

It almost uncommon eye infection. 
 I've learned wink either eye, laf!

I never ever touch eyes face without first washing hands. 

I'm doomed :cries:  fair, 301k case count yesterday hyper inflated. states don‚Äôt report cases weekend, dates didn‚Äôt report Labor Day either. you‚Äôre looking 3 day days cases yesterday. Question clinical trials - companies publish efficacy statistics, numbers simply reflect portion vaccinated people got infected versus portion unvaccinated people got infected. doesn‚Äôt account fact trials, subjects may home trials, subjects may going increases exposure. example, Pfizer reports 95% efficacy, could vaccinated people never got exposed Covid first place, right? isn‚Äôt standard measuring much exposure groups studies? know intentionally exposing people diseases unethical, can‚Äôt rats? feel like loose standard major reason contributing recent reports show contradictory numbers vaccine efficacy. fair, lot terrible consequences years actually. Law requires reasonable accommodation. reasonable accommodation choose endanger lives coworkers customers Zero complaints. Essure. Zero complaints,14 years later. like daughter getting hpv vax. Zero complaints, 7 years later. look problems correlate issues. Confirmation bias. Look up.  Regan proved one essential air travel fired air traffic controllers. kind interesting 3rd shot wasn‚Äôt bad. would thought antibodies, body would react bit more. I‚Äôm also scientist there‚Äôs that. Cut life they‚Äôre bad people.  lot smaller hospitals even pediatric ICU. Also, multi-symptom inflammatory disease often show weeks kid Covid-19. got vaccination numbers up...

It's getting harder harder care minimal thing needed avoid situation. much scientific data supports claim unvaccinated children go back daily in-person school safely? fully vaccinated Americans, risk hospitalized dying Covid-19 low -- much lower risk unvaccinated people. rare cases fully vaccinated person gets infected, data suggests older adults multiple underlying medical conditions risk serious illness.  August 30, US Centers Disease Control Prevention received reports 12,908 severe breakthrough cases Covid-19 among fully vaccinated people resulted hospitalization death. 173 million people fully vaccinated date, represents less 1 13,000 chance experiencing severe breakthrough case Covid-19.  70% breakthrough cases resulting hospitalization among adults 65 older 87% breakthrough cases resulting death among adults 65 older, CDC data suggests.  Unvaccinated adults United States 17 times likely hospitalized Covid-19 fully vaccinated adults, patients hospitalized breakthrough case tend older likely least three underlying medical conditions, according preprint study CDC posted last week.

Getting vaccination still safest way continue live earth. said wanted help community? 3m aura n95s pretty comfortable. Don‚Äôt dummy buy small pack larger one bucks more. 

Also, don‚Äôt get caught reviews. Yes, smells little strange right open it. let sit minutes won‚Äôt notice thing. know someone asked work home option üôÉ plenty vaccines, enough people getting vaccinated. along anti mask crowd isn‚Äôt helping things. stares get stores wearing mask absurd‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt like enough.  places School starting. Wait month. Thanks ! also good luck Office Depot. big shoulders, think nurse felt like really push there, lol. would driving crowd street fair. Serious question. Anti-vaxers say want vaccine untested could unsafe time willing take horse dewormer covid? make sense me. thought happens universal healthcare?   Moderna second dose period early. one ended another began week half, stopped four days third began four full days. Three full bleeding weeks month. 
Next one three weeks one seems getting back normal. 100% portland cops especially egregious wouldn‚Äôt sweat it. nervous 2nd one too. Got it, felt little sweaty went bed. Woke up. Felt fine.

Edit: like another poster said- make sure hydrate eat well day day of. think helps. felt bad first Pfizer shot likely working outside 2 days straight dehydrated.   Same, I‚Äôm electrician even county ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù never missed beat. 40+ hours end sight building hospitals since everyone wanting renovate everyone office. Probably reason want everyone go back see money put place! I've hard day many people kind me. least pass good feelings. Best wishes little fellow. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care do‚Äù funny

yea, know - I'm super stressed covid first, doctor scientist, professor/researcher reads scientific publications living. 

From perspective, 2 important aspects piece:

1) miniature literature review. actually new data presented here, (unusually) brief limited review literature surrounding Ivermectin.

2) authors argue inclusion Ivermectin combination therapies, including vaccinations, stand alone treatment prophalatic use. 

Basically, saying ""It years safety data \*might\* help, use it. combined corporate affiliations may help us put piece context. Remember, usually people write review issue

You‚Äôre hearing issues issues, everyone. Especially majority fine Yes, I‚Äôm aware do. original comment replied appeared assume article colleges, LAUSD. That‚Äôs replying to. find 98% figure hard believe. small community referencing? Someone needs alert Florida‚Ä¶. Regular nurses change travel though. Don‚Äôt see get 4x pay. Um, ok? say that. said son can't wear mask that, home since began. indoor public space since March 2020. understand comment. yes, correct. daughters school allowed parents year, reason amount medical exemptions seems heavily skewed religious politically conservative effected. Pfizer choice country get via COVAX? hope something domestic air travel. Negative tests needed international arrivals, fine, like virus already US require same.for domestic flights? Christian scientists? think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs called. get past then? whats plan going forward? lockdowns every winter???? Good Canadian think completely nuts government shut everything offered almost support anyone staying home. 

I'm sorry 2 choices leader giant douche turd sandwich. really get even framed exemption. outcome getting vaccine can't work, ""exempted"" all...that's treatment someone would get refused take vaccine even normally. 

Would direct say exemptions. Women receive vast majority lifetime vaccinations well start menstruating. Hopefully still tithe 10% well. Cuz know religion require international flights? lot people travel domestically. Makes sense require vaccination/negative tests domestic flights. exact experience first dose, strangely second. think real issue ivermectin advocate use anti-vaxers believe suitable substitute getting actual vaccine. wrong. However, ivermectin works, certainly could potentially useful treatment breakthrough cases. Although makes perfect sense, neither side seems want discussion pretty dumb. Thank Good grief astounding number.

I 9 month old son. terrified. Every adult wanted get vaccinated done months ago.

Right 12-15 yrs old kids still get 1st-2nd doses.

Israel giving booster shots anyone 18+ 2nd dose five months ago longer. Seriously checked fed employees know agency done jack shit it. hope mandate would gotten ppl know vaccinated protect family nope...

Seems like toothless policy far. holdout?!?  Pfizer doses (June/July) haven‚Äôt period since May 22, (am pregnant). Jadelle implant contraception since Feb year may coincidence‚Ä¶ periods regular, although lighter since sure what‚Äôs going on.
Hopefully someone else similar experience. Im surprised donating Mongolia Mongolia higher vaccination rate US. vaccines used effective enough need booster shot pfizer? love Israel go argument people want vax prove work, oblivious fact Israel dealing wave reintroducing mask mandates, social distancing and, course, vaccines  NZ mainland China managed controll it.

Seeing local people‚Äôs behavior really cements decision keep son virtual learning.  older higher vaccination rate generally death rate goes get older obviously. 90% 80+ year olds vaccinated that's case many areas deaths 80+ range might vaccinated. death rate within group much worse unvaccinated 80+ group they're numbered may raw deaths.

The huge crowd unvaccinated age 18-45 year olds move needle mostly age 65+ dying. 18-45's worse outcomes death still rare compared say 85 year old vaccinated person gets breakthrough case. 20% 12.

Among adults vaccination rate 80%.

For 60+ yrs old roughly 90%. here, got period day first sputnik shot (which like 14 days earlier) . wondered could vaccine side effect, guess was! 

Got 2nd shot yesterday issues far.  Eh? person asked, yup, clots.  Everything wide open Illinois too. since we're idiots (well... Chicago area) bubble fire.

The nutters almost it. Imagine got paid leave get vaccine wear masks. fucking pay people stay home work like every developed nation done? He's better Trump point; cases higher time last year. Exposure work school what's driving cases part, know kids school parents ""have work"".

Biden 8 months now. 8.

45 entire year get shit done failed miserably, costing thousands lives process.

At least president listens science, crying inject hydroxychloroquine disinfectant stop virus.

We least president encourages Americans wear masks social distance possible.

Of course cases worse now. virus never stagnant. plenty time evolve (hence mu variant now) variant gets stronger. supposed powerful fucking country world, yet succumbed .08 Oz fabric covering faces entire time. *yeaahh* .... definitely *joke* .... we'll go that.

I particularly anything Moderna, retrospect latest data seems indicate offers higher level protection (at least shot #2). likely due higher dose Moderna uses (100ug shot#1, 50ug shot#2) compared Pfizer( 30ug all/any shots). 

I seen initial data Pfizer released late July clinical trial benefits 3rd shot, numbers looking quite good (estimated 500%-2000% increase antibodies/titers 3rd dose). delta variant starting really take creep numbers back up, breakthrough infections starting become common, wife also starting back teaching school (and I'm one states cannot require masks schools), expecting exposed. Decided waiting recommended get booster went it.

For reference:

In case, gave real name gotten 1st 2nd shot adjacent state state took forever open general population, believe state records. extra careful though, transposed day month date birth since day mine &lt;= 12. example born Feb 11, 1989: people would write 02/11/1989; ""mistakenly"" wrote 11/02/1989.

I located South Carolina, however provided official White House press statement mean ""No ID required, insurance required"" statement apply federally, i.e. state. time virus changes becomes infectious. time immunity rarely stays high forever wanes. 

Put two together get observed trend based context numbers. forget holidays. Many travel last year definitely visit family year, especially vaccines available.

Cases peaked January 2021. Today US around number cases saw early November 2020. Yeah, try patient since kinda advantage asking media coverage. don‚Äôt want ‚Äúthat person‚Äù, aren‚Äôt forthright parents needs reported on. rAmen! well, fellow pastatarian! May noodley appendages grant peace savory sauces! power police unions vs. fluid city government. take court argue it. That's system designed for. 

I'm going tell crazy, I'm going tell go see arguments fly. 

At end day, united granted religious exemption, united acknowledging religious reason follow policy, turn, put unpaid leave singling religious minority, illegal. 

They made mandatory allowed exemptions goal. Wow vague confusing    wonder mis-c situation look like month üò¨   suddenly started apostrophes might need use one‚Ä¶ could whole new interpretation Cafeteria Catholicism ü§î spread virus children taken longer thought would happen. 

I guessing schools would closed already. course still opening month. Louisiana city we're paying testing. $100k taken various funds testing employees.  this!

My child's school returned early Aug. Local media schools patting back successful reopening.  

Except school send one classes home day #2 child tested +, tried cover up.  tipped local newspaper TV station. TV crew went next ask principal low behold sending home half 7th grade another + case.  Perfect timing interview principal parents... Really rained 'success, reopened' messaging.

Since numerous kids leaving sick every day.. testing encouraged  

Today school emails bought Abbott rapid tests want permission test needed. course means off-label... 1 2 per student 36hrs apart.  odd... they.are clear Abbott tests reported anybody , reason take them.



D ask name? (And so, give fake name?) state in? may gotten person know legally required. could always press issue, easier try another location. 

I confirm Walmart issue ""forgot ID"" ""uninsured"".  don‚Äôt think read paper read different meta analysis. Nearly studies included meta-analysis randomized control trials comparing IVM placebos. healthy enough, maybe thinking another meta analysis, would assume 2 dozen studies included used crappy methodology. Sure issues them, mentioned earlier post (did read part?) assessed quality study weighted totals favor stronger studies. 

Anyhow back assertion use healthier patients, description range health conditions 15 studies looked use IVM treatment hospitalized patients. you‚Äôll notice, range health conditions. 

‚ÄúThe effect reducing deaths consistent across mild moderate severe disease subgroups.‚Äù There's large amount individuals received J&amp;J first shot decided keep waiting additional protection get one two mRNA shots own. also subset people guidance primary care doctor get one two mRNA boosters immunocompromised recommended get booster FDA yet options since people got J&amp;J mostly ignored respect boosters.

Ultimately best judge risk tolerance protection delta/new variants, health wellbeing hands. welcome wait guidance govt next, also welcome wait get ""first"" shot clinic doses Pfizer/Moderna. Relying question seems like may rhetorical. 

Religious exemptions (COVID vaccine otherwise) usually contain language belief sincerely held. works ok people sincerely hold religious belief medical treatment (Christian Scientists 7th Day Adventists well known examples). 

For seek abuse exemption policy becomes bit game chicken enforcer making judgment risks allowing exemption vs risks getting tagged religious discrimination Pastafarian.   Proof religious beliefs mix. absolutely claim whatever want, course. However, much like freedom speech, idea freedom religion equate freedom consequences. That‚Äôs helluva thing call Sam Houston, guess you‚Äôve got point. üòâ surprised news!....... politicians unwilling use political power force change. cannot compromise someone doesn‚Äôt believe basic medical theory.

Many thanks! I'm still wondering kind religion supposed be?? thing comes mind would JW, even I'm sure. pretty obvious time someone criticizes ""unvaccinated"" comes COVID, mean people willingly unvaccinated under-12's immunocompromised. \[sips bigly\] already multiple staff school open month docked daily rate next time sick need personal day. gonna rough second semester. believe many humans, Mongolia probably right place start complaining about.  social behavioral factors behind ebb flow waves complex - things like whether 20-somethings live alone parents make big difference too, could add variety items list. 

The backbone still vaccines - given news Israel, good note Denmark 73% fully vaccinated Israel's 63%. Israel started early leader vaccinations more, since summer. sounds like combination greatest common divisor least common multiple. compute them, need second number indicated ""common"".

However, 188,370 divide evenly 6, appears 31,395 vials. remember correctly 50 vials/300 doses box. appears like indeed shipping partially open box. Unless also distributing larger quantities, probably right albeit boring answer. Okay, that's Nose taken care of... Mouth? Covid-19 gargle mouthwash coming soon?

Last time checked, Covid-19 Respiratory Virus, I'm pretty sure mouth connected lungs (not stomach).

Also, lot people breathe mouth. thing people (mainly place power) like - make measures wearing masks, social distancing, vaccines quarantines permanent fixtures society fear need control. honestly think pandemic last forever medical/ scientific sense? No, afraid called temporary measures made permanent across society.  unfortunate people medical issues make vulnerable virus, means take extra personal precautions include forcing actions mandates upon people. feeling years many people going regret much personal choice power willingly gave away realize get back. Well, mean, kerosene heater great thing gets cold live, necessarily waste money that.


Also, IMO good idea keep gallons fresh water trunk times. Always possible get stuck somewhere long period time away source potable water. Would also helpful come across someone who's stranded dehydrated, homeless dehydrated, etc. Sorry people life  I'd rather take infected vaccinated person non vaccinated person day week since going carry smaller viral load. Vaccinated reduces risk less likely pick experiences covid around.

Now running event like concert I'd both. read article vaccinations Mongolia rememer correctly basically accepted vaccines many different countries, hoped gain political influence. remember correctly, Russia, China, India US. Apparently Mongolia geostrategically interesting many countries. are, how‚Äôs proven? Like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take vaccine religion‚Äù? Yes, religion protected class, no? ability speak not. sure hope so! Fingers crossed ü§û going consider case case basis approve deny them. denied, employee 5 weeks get vaccinated. I‚Äôm pretty sure good lawyers found precedent this, may see SCOTUS case couple years. 

I‚Äôd imagine reason contains aborted fetal tissue, would denied, that‚Äôs true. Also, pope said it‚Äôs ok get vaccinated even though used cells development. appreciate approach, also don‚Äôt want see rights violated. believe religion protected class. refuse vaccinated religion, matter argument, put FMLA. OTOH, weed false religious exemptions. don‚Äôt know, interesting see plays out.  Australia starting get really controlling.  new religion requires universal Healthcare housing. talk making happen?

The results:

Nope. It'll repeat.  Might able get tested CVS Walgreens.

Side note: one biggest fears long term health impact kids. Right lot parents kids school dealing clusters/quarantine on. kids health road? would parents feel ailment(s) caused infection? 
What could done differently? Well obvious masks, think schools enough. Example kids school everyone packed cafeteria extremely limited outdoor eating. case. Crowded hallways, parents sending sick kids school. list goes on. 
Ultimately respond kids question (x years) want know covid related illness? Blame school? Nope us 30% population subscribes ideology contrarianism, destruction toddler-level rebellion.   Would much easier implement policies industrial facilities across US severely short-staffed right now. Welp.

That's 0.1% likely good vaccinated people catching COVID per week right now, essentially 1% ten weeks, **5%** per year. sure there's better data breakthroughs right (since one seems interested long COVID, CDC stopped tracking cases altogether back May) seems okay news. 5% still pretty high, remember, there's still 50% original chance getting long COVID, course adjust lower chance infection.

They also mention hospitalizations reduced 75% vaccination, *very* different CDC's (IIRC?) 99% reported earlier.

this smart, ORGANIZED RELIGION bans vaccines... believe lol, pro-vaccine? I'm literally double jabbed (and soon available age), I've discussed vaccine efficacy etc quite lot here, [for real I'm unclear people mad Biden announcement, alternative vaccinated weekly testing incredibly reasonable? still even ""vaccine mandate"" there's weekly testing alternative. reckon amount actual violence caused type person dramatically America. crazies fervent numerous access tools violence hugely so.

My point, admittedly blunt emotionally difficult process, seasonal flu similar worse mortality rate children. lived certain norms amongst flu, prepared amongst COVID? It‚Äôs going eradicated. can‚Äôt calculate vaccine effectiveness comparing % vaccinated unvaccinated like that. changes based population vaccinated. everyone vaccinated, serious cases would among vaccinated. 

You would need compare number unvaccinated became infected went serious disease number fully vaccinated became infected went serious disease. 

In various population studies calculation shown unvaccinated 29 times risk serious disease.

Here quick google result showing risk. Exactly. odd example use. Getting vaccine covid strictly *just* personal choice.

I sorry sister epilepsy, far proof vaccine bad. already well-known vaccine could lead allergic reaction small number people.

In fact, many medicine foods cause allergic reaction too. standard, literally foods medicine bad. standard simply couldn‚Äôt vaccine lead exactly zero issues everyone. never standard medicine throughout human history, shouldn‚Äôt apply covid vaccine either. really depends. example, Muslim women need exemption wear hijab passport photos (since headgear typically prohibited). issues that. Thankfully, Muslims pro-vaccine pro-science... believe Pfizer vaccine actually created Muslim Turkish couple. large chunk medical doctors Muslim. Good.   yeah ""your body choice"" valid long &lt;insert authorized reason  Qualified immunity nothing prosecution shooting people. Agreed! Well, prescribing harmless drug nothing people would probably spend lot less dealing looking own.

But that's really based media saying. There's actual numbers much harm horse ivermectin doing.   son told today received messages school positive cases found among classmates. Oddly, parents informed.

It feels really wrong - sentimental here? Yep, schools seem pretending like flu. me, logical vaccine efficacy gradually reduced country unvaccinated people get immunity natural infection? 

Also case Israel, unvaccinated generally younger people normally less impact Corona. risk groups uptake much higher, actually vaccine much better job might think reading headline. article mentions 60+ groups, vaccinated offers 10 times protection. I‚Äôm giving morning send media ask informing parents. Knowing school district they‚Äôre hiding political reasons. no. confusing 3 different people responding you..

Let simplify repeatedly stated true even article touches confirms.

Replication errors random.
Mutations formed replication errors. 
Mutations become prevalent one mutations allows compete variants.

The mutation extinction event reference sited march 2020 pre vaccines pre natual immunity.

I care believe me.  also dont care dont agree article linked clearly backs i'm saying. 

You keep saying base everything primary source yet clearly comprehend article link says. 

""""The initial period rapid diversification region-specific phylogenies ended February 2020 followed major extinction event global homogenization concomitant spread D614G spike protein, ending March 2020. ... extinction earliest partitions, 1 2, corresponds advent S|D614G, became fixed partitions globally ubiquitous June 2020 """" 

You stated ""There diversification mutations followed emergence D614G structure spike protein extinction event due vaccine."" true vaccines early stage trials. 

""The results show ongoing evolution SARS-CoV-2 pandemic characterized primarily purifying selection, small set sites appear evolve positive selection.""

This means majority mutations random, lateral changes rather adaptions. Certain adaptions however seem advantageous selected new environment.

If you‚Äôre area reasonable people mask social distance + high vaccination rates, chances catching covid much less mine area covid raging. Wtf? love Capitalism now!  There‚Äôs nothing keeping kids getting both.

Not saying still viral load

Not saying still similar study Israel, published day journal Nature Medicine, found vaccinated people got infected lower viral load -- fourfold lower unvaccinated people.

Not saying still reduced viral loads hint potentially lower infectiousness, contributing vaccine effect virus spread.""

Not saying still transmitted.

Also fails take account 70% still unvaccinated time. Vaccines work entirety society 30% people them. basic 7th grade science.

So misinformation claiming science show vaccinated still transmitted article provided disagrees statement made go along it. year's RSV steroids. respecting normal seasonality, hitting older kids even adults really hard also abnormal. RSV put youngest hospital 4 months old.

This combination non-uniform vaccinations (old ages far vaccinated) risk (old ages much higher risk) results vaccinated people *overrepresented* case stats and, especially, hospitalization stats.. makes vaccines *seem* less effective actually are.

Almost everyone know got Pfizer side effects people mild side effects compared everyone know got moderna. testing facilities legally required report positive tests Department Health. think United find ton evidence religions ban vaccines they're basically saying ""sure exempt religious reasons working getting paid.""

Pretty badass them. think they're right. gotta start calling bs religious excuses.  JNJ one uses production.

The mRNA vaccines used different cell line testing.

Either way, religious leaders say vaccines still moral.

Good, I'll flying UA Capitalism ability buy way consequences actions. Guess lock children flu season every year never put car either COVID-19 vaccines contain fetus cells.

But, like lies, based kernel truth. 

Basically, fifty years ago, scientists took samples cells two aborted fetuses. cell lines descended used testing mRNA vaccine production J&amp;J vaccine.

According Pope, still morally acceptable take vaccines long reliable alternative treatments exist.

I'm Catholic, family is. told that, said hydroxychloriquine effective treatment religious exemption honored.

Maybe people deserve religious exemption, don't. exemption work review. Supposedly, employees using reasoning discussion HR. I'm hoping odd discussions sussed joined church day mandatory policy went lot hope.

Vaccinated unvaccinated persons get tested symptomatic close contact someone suspected confirmed COVID-19. **Continued adherence non-pharmaceutical interventions** periods high community transmission mitigate spread COVID-19 remain important vaccinated unvaccinated individuals.  
 
Non-pharmaceutical interventions = masks, isolation necessary (contact infected), distancing. 
 
The public health advisory comittees countries lag adapting newest science, throughout entire pandemic. 
 
People going flights fucking air tight cylinder, concerts, etc., going vaccinated people, they‚Äôre going foremost spreaders variant generators domestically. people virtually all, actually vaccinated.

I‚Äôd stake fair bit this. Last year time:

* Israel coronavirus surge (peaked sept 26)
* denmark basically covid early sept 2020

This year, Israel surge, Denmark‚Äòs cases also comparatively low. However, compare last year, every metric worse countries. Denmark:

* Cases 3x worse
* Deaths 2 per day vs. 0 per day. Can‚Äôt multiplier cause none last year lol
* Test positivity rate 1.2% vs. 0.5%
* Hospitalizations 6.5x worse
* ICU 6.5x worse

Respiratory viruses seasonal. reasonable expect Denmark‚Äôs waves follow annual pattern, like Israel Florida‚Äôs waves followed annual pattern.  


In northern country like Denmark, summer time declare victory! make winter, \*then\* brag. right I‚Äôm seeing stats worse year year, obvious decrease hospitalizations per case. $1.6 million cover photocopies clinical study. Lol, good catch. right, is. Covid stay costs par kidney transplants? heart attack like third that? 

I mean, looks like somebody accidentaly opened worms exposed highly inflated prices ""it's global pandemic, expense spared! might well capitalise that"" Sounds good, ONE person Delta lead 800 infections. can't let single case slip we're screwed again. medical infrastructure able cope mass infection. Well, Christian Scientists believe using medicine, would say Christian Science would exempt vaccine. definitely evengelical Christian sects based faith healing avoid medication.

That‚Äôs really thing. Viruses don‚Äôt inevitably mutate become less harmful. Delta twice likely lead hospitalization according broad studies.

Smartest move play. (See Wargames move conclusion) Vaccination forbidden Islam though. Like people believe private business (like social media companies) allowed discriminate censor.  There's episode Call Midwife newborn 60s brittle bone disease CS parents even allow pain relief. prayers, come around end. pretty rough episode. guys make sound like waiting eggs hatch aren‚Äôt vaccinated, death rate hasn‚Äôt changed. It‚Äôs January 2020. get vaccinated, won‚Äôt need worry.  Israel never 20k cases day. maximum 11,328 cases single day last week. last couple days 5k, except yesterday. Tuesday Israel \~6,800 cases, Monday \~10,800. measures indeed somewhat problematic depend number tests, varies day day. However percentage positive tests also decreasing recent days.

An even reliable measure reduction number new critically ill patients, depend number tests all. steadily decreasing since end August, 20% peak.

The overall reduction R 1 particularly surprising anomalous ‚Äî continuation trend began soon start booster campaign, ongoing month.  need say somewhere... Finally got first üíâ today! country waiting starting go full general population. Gotta admit, bit anticlimactic wait quick prick done, I'm glad finally group (semi) safe people :) Empathy unfortunately started run dry. We‚Äôre burnt shit searching horizon. There‚Äôs always chance aliens show up, friendly, decide help us mess we‚Äôve created. feel like that‚Äôs best hope, honestly.   medical officers military realize.

Abstinence effective preventing HIV (and STDs) condoms. tad unrealistic impractical, concern Catholic Church. real question is: drop R due changes behaviours NPIs? due sufficeint levels immunity?

If latter, we're good. former, rise behaviours revert baseline.  OK, let's say 1000 people. 800 vaccinated 200 unvaccinated. unvaccinated get Covid 10% chance end hospital. So... 1000 people get Covid, 20 unvaccinated, 20 vaccinated go hospital (half-half). means vaccinated 2.5% risk hospitalized compared 10% unvaccinated. course, simplified example.   Period (39F, hormonal contraception) first Moderna shot came right time literally worst life - painful, heavy, many clots almost fainted times never happened before. 

At time even connect vaccine already 2 weeks on; actually worried might early menopausal symptom, quite relieved read me. 

Fortunately, least, things pretty much normal second dose ever since...    Honest question: irregardless stance Pro v. Anti-vaccine, isn‚Äôt religious discrimination illegal? So, wouldn‚Äôt putting someone unpaid leave based solely thier religion violate federal law? would love hear attorney says, someone experience field. I'm literally talking yesterday's numbers compared day last week.

What article calls spike simply day day increase, happens time. Words like their, like basics English language. insane native speaking person write use properly. elementary school stuff.

Anyway, I'm upset, I'm saying abbreviations labels getting hand, experience (like example person replied originally) people easily get offended use properly (but also use all). That's ashame. deserve much worse. Best luck! union would never release information complaints. Lock em forever. There's reason treat major organized religion valid small denomination even personal religious conviction. Batton work, really antivax people minority, hesitant due FUD misinformation. 

If can't see benefits vaccine vs catching covid, easily see benefits getting vaccine vs getting banned everywhere. somebody tell effective supposedly is? immediately see glanced article paper **Spoiler alert** Sadly everybody won‚Äôt part. going come back bite Biden CDC ass. CDC guidelines encouraging full classrooms little restrictions social distancing bullshit. I'm pro-vaccine - extremely relieved elderly relatives board them. hoping given long COVID young people worry risks unique either.

I've reading G20 Rome pact many health ministers agreed with. changed goals donate jabs poorest countries year year, 2 bi 1,45 bi doses (enough 40% population). number based matter richer countries donating enough COVAX facility. Anyhow seems rather realistic goal, also say COVAX speeding up, even though jabs enough (for now). truly hoping unquestionable need vaccinated year's end. Enough ""recommendations"". want see action.

Well ok. I‚Äôm aware religions ban vaccination werk, you. hear ridiculous policy blah blah blah Covid test. 

And eternally grateful way hell woman going able visit hospital stay. national vaccine mandate instituted yet (for eligible)? even national mask mandate? Work home easily solves traffic jams emissions. One good things come covid bosses force implement it, technology existed years use.

Who earth wants sit traffic jam hour even way every monday friday? sure agency, mum word Defense Dept. think delay probably coming negotiations AFGE can't say sure. would imagine we'll see something soon.

On another note, I'm kind wondering Biden actually mandate vaccine federal employees today. Probably crap storm could create. consider like United Airlines placing unvaccinated people unpaid leave current surge starts dying down.  like somebody accidentaly opened worms exposed highly inflated prices ""it's global pandemic, expense spared! might well capitalise that""

ICU cost 1600$/day Canada. end-up usually couple weeks. Data shown false. soon FDA approved bullshit needs stop. friends always try tell abput science regarding covid pcr tests variants cytokine storms.. say ""I undergraduate degree human biology 100% unqualified judge merits science medical papers. virologist molecular biologist specialist. absolutely way verifying high level technical information going pretend simple common sense especially conclusions meant draw differ radically global consensus actual experts world."" School openings midst pandemic never safe, especially huge chunk students vaccinated.

It's unfortunate truth think officials honest that. Much better chance dying unvaccinated. say. Right. ""controversial""? take vaccines go college, travel. get pets vaccinated. literally understand. people can't make right decision public health, government step them. there's anything I've learned throughout pandemic people, including media political leaders, can't understand communicate statistics data. draw conclusion 100% black white. simple, elegant *had* work months summer. submitted proof vaccination, got special sticker security badge need follow masking/SD rules.

Then along came delta. Vaccine 25$ per dose. 50$

Covid Test 100$

Hospitalized patient 23K$. 920 expensive vaccine risks lifetime reduced lung capacity. can‚Äôt sacrifice virgins volcano god, people shouldn‚Äôt get exemption vaccines. Many trust government, includes FDA, trust sources information Facebook, think provide ""real deal"". weird, since want increase number pirates lower global warming. decrease sunny days lower amounts holy days get? guess care others happiness something. weird see religion. mean Texans wanted completely independent first, didn‚Äôt join US right away shared border US‚Ä¶ Could agree more. know thing yet. even think way stringent it, I'm tired hearing ""negative tests unvaccinated"". require vaccinations fly domestically we'd getting somewhere. lie, active ingredient used livestock medication, widely available, people inadvisably buying using that. doses much higher much larger animal publication poison control center showing spike cases ivermectin poisoning.  climate change people fought adaptation mitigation efforts personal corp/govt levels. Yes, manufacturing agriculture much larger exporters greenhouse gases pollutants, get away people govts allow, govts regulate people demand regulated. slowly happening vaccine uptake, people, healthcare/education systems, markets demand vaccine uptake protect capital, employees, customers leaders forced public opinion change stances one wins popularity contest vocal minority one actually serves public need. Vaccines work period what? employee angry particular policy much leg stand on. IANAL supposedly make reasonable accommodations given exception.

AFAIK airline could state unable provide such, recourse let go.

Take grain salt tho. Oh look, it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve saying (and heard read immunologists, etc.) since start back March 2020! Better safe sorry. I'm looking forward see happens election politicians coddle idiots votes . know, really hope this. 14 days asked before, must involve something people want discuss answers *really* unsatisfying. lmao, confirm strange stories changes smell/food taste months afterwards.

Am vaccinated since months, mild corona december 2020, food changed taste since week now. Attributing past corona evangelical Protestants Catholic population close behind. Got it. Glad able reference people like comment. Absolutely useless society rigorous study finds surgical masks highly protective, cloth masks fall short. Let think want. think need glasses reason. anyone asks, tell later glasses help better without them. Always put health safety everything else. US almost certainly. labor protections, particularly relates health threats anothers health accomodation offered. would get flight? idiot, smart. 

Link great, read shows correcting age imbalance, effectiveness still age group. vaccine require, negative covid test within 24 hours travel. Even vaccinated spread Covid. read statement America woman (fully vaccinated) tested negative 3 days prior entering US, tested home, tested positive. can't believe nobody gave real example, Pfizer reports 95% efficacy, could vaccinated people never got exposed Covid first place, right? isn‚Äôt standard measuring much exposure groups studies? know intentionally exposing people diseases unethical, can‚Äôt rats?

Okay, first, standard trial *nobody knew got actual vaccine got placebo*. ""double blind"" study. people giving shots know administering placebo vaccine. people getting shots know either.

So waited bunch cases ""unblind"" find got vaccine got placebo.

Second, challenge studies rhesus macaques results better real world studies humans. trying contrarian, want argument sound, say ""According Pope"". Catholics obligated follow everything Pope says without discernment, accurately point toe line. 

The [Congregation Doctrine said two vaccines permissible one grave necessity. CDF exists ""spread sound Catholic doctrine defend points Christian tradition seem danger new unacceptable doctrines."" put leave religious view. put leave protected COVID. Per article, COVID level control, customer facing roles able return work. Non-customer facing roles able return improved testing sanitation ability. medical exemptions.

Also many labor laws around accomodations public health/imminent health threat section advising imminent threat health employees others required provide intervention. would well within right (imo) fire anyone get vaccine given pandemic. basically find medical treatment tested embryonic cells point. point stands pretty much everything drive hour get second Pfizer shot later hear Moderna might protective. Sigh. Horse paste? bizarre world live teenager mature person room full adults. They'll prove they've never vaccinated. Wait start using catma instead... possible get covid realize vaccinated?  requires whatever self-serving bullshit imagine

Show vaccine card, take mask off, enjoy pre-pandemic. gotten sick yet, friends - infected pre-vax. know see ton breakthrough infections news etc, reality they're still pretty damn rare. Get vaccine, dipshits. difference big enough even someone tested confirmed infected probably better even bad outcome covid blood clots. no-brainer know covid causes kinds problems, including death.

For people speculating might infected, difference even larger. Please know alone frustration.

I would like encourage post /r/SuicideWatch.

If crisis, please contact local emergency services local hotline: Hotline Directory can't believe I'm saying this, anyone else think vaccinating kinda needs stop. mean maybe giving dampen effects infection one thing. either vaccinated EVERYONE all. half assing vaccines reason supposed new mutations popping pandemic never end. get we're going live virus, shit show. Hell, given everyone claiming got ""delta* variant even vaxxing kinda weird. know got Delta? someone actually sequence strain? assuming got Delta bc media even researchers claim delta variant popular variant...even though every sample sequenced prove it. 

I got vaxxed months ago, idk I'm gonna go get booster id going available soon. Feels like we're going selecting something even dangerous occur sooner later. 

Either get booster fuck it.  fucking guy. start?  Colorado, saw article took look dashboard. may interested King County, WA (Seattle) dashboard, thing, adjusts Hahaha   record numbers pediatrics cases right far RSV, least according two pediatricians I've talked recently. 

COVID concern, number childrens deaths due covid smaller die swimming pools year. think need vaccine point - countries evaluated data voted vaccinating young children. 

At least delta, latest data Israel shows, vaccine almost nothing prevent infection transmission, good keeping hospital dying. 

Schools would need taking extended safety precautions safely reopen point even 100% school kid vaccination. safety precautions would probably help RSV too. reposted information. posted prior post caught automod. Stick time. fuckers held forced this. Vaccine mandates seem increasing vax rates % get shot going down. times carrots, times sticks. Following things working countries like providing cheap rapid tests really good policy. vaccine mandate probably come scrutiny, even SC likely back Biden particular issue.  Le sigh.

Thanks. concern seems rising antibodies dropping infection rates among boosted-populations deceptive ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù occur don‚Äôt end improving outcomes medium long term end waste.

Is really something that‚Äôs top pile possibilities though? metrics pointing towards boosters something positive least immediate term, positive outcomes unfolding way that‚Äôs consistent understanding vaccines work. yea it‚Äôs always possibility advantage suddenly vanish, proactive reason worry actually case?

If don‚Äôt think preventing infection worthwhile goal vs preventing hospitalization death that‚Äôs different topic, far looks like boosters provide extra protection infection, believe worthy aspiration. See, root misconception right here. 

Those breakthrough cases really preventable additional shots moment, delta *somewhat* antibody resistant current vaccines. People pick new symptomatic infections, even quite quickly vaccination, booster not. rate cases, breakthrough infections, driven presence boosters; driven fact 50% population countries still unvaccinated. Heck, US passed 50% recently climbing especially fast. really know narrative boosters answer came from, clear nothing change base vaccination rate climbs least 80%.

Fascinating Twitter thread James Ward (mathematician rather epidemiologist, prior models arguably accurate government scientists.

He's found programme rapid boosters (for vulnerable) followed quite slow programme boosters everyone else (running next Spring) would optimal outcome.

The criticism think may over-estimated waning protection hospitalisation, constant decline 2% per month, yet real-world data (including studies showed rapid fall protection infection) shown really quite sticky protection hospitalisation (e.g. recent study Bahrain showed efficacy infection falling zero, still efficacy hospitalisation 90%). flaw one acknowledged here: so, bit luck central projections slightly pessimistic side, nothing tweak assumptions fix (if proven required). haven‚Äôt even reached stage painful blisters form mouth.

I live MT. Super curious see plays given state government right now. [Montana's Greg, No, companies stingy. definitely going find ways pay unvaccinated little possible testing time.  lazy jokers even ride 5 minutes car get free vaccine ... ain't gonna take streets protests. They've played noble patriots long could, paycheck threatened see many quietly submitting. Especially states like Texas vaccine mandates outlawed business state contract. know company chomping bit enact mandate want lose state contract. say allow time get tested? entirely company suspect not. Another problem US , place go kind care 5/6 pm ER. There's calling family doctor anything like that. Even useless urgent care open since urgent really means cant wait weeks takes get PCP.  Tough appear court ya ded reason believe you. Why? They're quoting doctor, doctor using booking system shows wait-times minutes minutes - nobody ever thought wait time get hospital would ... thousands minutes.  Larry Cosme, president Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, called mandate federal workers ‚Äúill conceived,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúVaccination promoted education encouragement ‚Äì coercion.‚Äù

What fuck think education encouragement look like then? Sure shit seems like we‚Äôve tried whole lot already. favorite cops? let assholes win. 100% support this. Enough enough. know, speech best could imagined. Broad vaccine mandates, easy cheap testing access, business shutdowns/mask mandates derail life otherwise. Seems good me.    got note Twitter today hospitals overrun vaccinated patients. Un fucking believable.

Take example school classroom may outbreak students positive symptomatic. 5 students positive test entire classroom odds something like 1/2^5 5 false negatives &lt;4% likelihood false negatives. quarantine whole classroom exposure probably best possible person class risk management.

I'm sure specifically studied Covid, observed diseases post-vaccine asymptomatic breakthrough infections boost antibody titers. /r/COVID19/comments/p7tyki/individuals_cannot_rely_on_covid19_herd_immunity/ ""Similarly, even natural respiratory infections measles variola (smallpox) viruses, famous inducing life-long immunity disease, prevent respiratory reinfection, though asymptomatic nontransmissible, detected increased antiviral antibody titers.""

And someone fully vaccinated never get exposed, nessecarily bad thing. antibody levels wane time, supposed to, otherwise whole body weight would nothing antibodies. vaccine also induce robust memory cell response, means quickly manufacture antibodies upon re-exposure. type immunity expected last years lifetime, may able prevent mild infections like high levels antibodies, expected prevent disease progression, severe symptoms, hospitalization etc.  There's another stat may misleading well. watching Florida round table heads State's largest health care providers. One said half fully vaccinated covid positive patients admitted non-covid related procedures/reasons. patients completely asymptomatic required get tested procedurally upon admission. Anybody knows anything logical knows LGBT isn‚Äôt tied HIV/AIDS epidemic. fear campaign Christian Protestant fanatics.

Being unvaccinated choice.

Its simple choice get vaccinated not. blame society safety measures protect people them.

Personally, don‚Äôt care anymore. Whether Covid vaccine infection America reach herd immunity. I‚Äôm also one paying ten thousands dollars hospital stay aren‚Äôt vaccinated.  Please don‚Äôt forget future problems strokes, etc. caused Covid. course. always outliers. antivax tends go hand-in-hand lower levels education. various hospital techs, EMTs, nurses BSN equivalent tend show higher proportions antivax personnel than, say, BSN, MSN, Practitioners, PAs MDs. I‚Äôm vaxxed support mandate Trump anti vax stuff come from? guy could expedite development, publicly vaccinated spoken publicly vaccines many times? antivax morons existed long Trump Biden announced Walmart, Kroger Amazon sell at-home test kits COST. tremendous.  like weekly testing option. public workers, tests subsidized tax dollars. ok taxes funding job prospects science deniers.

But good start. tide turning... Maybe create popcorn emporium compliment pitchfork one. Shit could watch day. Hopefully applies state local governments (with 100 employees) too. Police one lowest vaccination rates there. Yessssssss. Thanks response. one rights‚Äô favorite memes says: ""quarantine restricting movement sick people.""

Yep, sounds right. That's alright, can't stand themselves, either, otherwise they'd acknowledge wrong, actions hurt killed people, could move society vaccines *and* mandatory masking public.

Oh hey, Wisconsin game mentioned article. Ended wearing mask, regrets. Saw plenty others around also masked, though student section pretty much maskless.

If fully vaccinated masked, see reason go. odds catching Covid masked, vaccinated, outside low.

That said, fear going games unmasked unvaccinated - especially SEC territory. Would surprised see spikes southern college towns fall. Yes would seem

I cant see forcing shot result neutral positive outcome suspect court challenges social backlash increase counter productive everyone. 

FYI also shot.  thought r/nottheonion sec  denied?  I've saying years. even trying really green making everyone drive one building another work could done remotely. It‚Äôs matter accommodation. can‚Äôt accommodate choice receive vaccine. health mandates many professions. won‚Äôt get job don‚Äôt comply. think CDC trying push ‚Äúboosters aren‚Äôt really necessary‚Äù narrative way get vaccine hesitant people vaccinated. CDC probably feels public availability booster shots would feed anti-vaxx narrative. 

I don‚Äôt agree stance btw, probably CDC thinking. necessarily, could argue vaccination prior taking particular religion CURRENTLY practicing.

If mom/dad atheist took get vaccinated infant even school, could still argue could refuse time though.

That said, think employer treats religions allow vaccination equally fires anyone practices religion allow vaccination based work function (vaccination required since he/she come contact potentially many people including people vaccinated may considered liability company), PROBABLY pass muster equal treatment. mean, suddenly take religion allow flying, think grounds lawsuit fired company refusing fly?  idiot nurse that. I've seen dozens nurses refusing wear masks medical offices Florida, cases charts hospitals overflowing COVID patients. Anyone fool. Patriotism limits. Anyone still quarantining post-vax point delusional.

You're getting downvoted use heavily negative terms like ""delusional"".

For example, I'm almost 60 years old, asthma, though I'm doubly vaxxed. Usually go time. Now... no.

There's music festival town starting today, want see it, won't, one wears masks.

We still get food delivered, honestly, get better results supermarket, also one wears masks.

I making decisions otherwise make, consider chances catching COVID small, zero. musician played twice, great guy perfect shape doubly vaccinated, died breakthrough COVID recently nursing mother years older I.

I call ""quarantine"" even though strict I'm cowering home.

That's said UK 2-3 months ago. ""They're past 40,000 cases day peak cases falling rapidly - remove lasted 2 weeks, never fell far, cases back 37,000 day climbing.

We currently evidence COVID ""burning through"" anything, hitting wall 80-90% whole population vaccinated. ""They also mention hospitalizations reduced 75% vaccination, different CDC's (IIRC?) 99% reported earlier.""

This comparison unvaccinated individuals. making assumption unvaccinated individuals 100% chance hospitalized case.

Let's \*assume\* 10% unvaxxed hospitalized getting COVID. would mean 2.5% vaccinated would hospitalized.

However, also catching COVID. know vaccines make even less likely. all, back napkin math says vaccinated individuals less 1% likely hospitalized due COVID. Mexican states settled American immigrants. Also, totally agree slavery played role; I'm saying biggest concern.  True. remember substitute teacher teaching Pre-K kids. One day subbing told one kids headache.

These bipeds brain dead even know it.

Also cares take boosters every 6-8 months? Like oh no, I‚Äôll run day two twice year effects order fucking die choking lungs, awful! don‚Äôt even know lol Chile booster shots already administered (and get them). study published days ago third shot increases antibodies lot (14x), it‚Äôs consistent Israeli study data.

My parents got AZ booster shots today. booster shot (which going Pfizer) administered late November-early December. Go antibodies! Try donating blood. They'll tell got antibodies.   What? I'm masks, ridiculous claim. 

So say span days go work times grocery store gym couple times. week later covid. telling say, ""that one person grocery store Tuesday gave covid""? 

You remembered pitch fork, left common sense home. happened town.

I want think means real terms. That's average starting pay. That's average pay professionals 25+ years working job (there promotions teaching career, keep title rest life - teacher.). 

And that's average pay career workers job usually requires least masters degree, certainly one bachelor's degrees, six figures student debt even audition for.  

That average pay includes teachers trying live indoors cities like New York, LA San Francisco average cost home north million dollars. 

While may possibly lower paying jobs require masters degree professional certifications practice, I'm hard pressed think offhand. 

Most teachers know work evenings weekends planning preparing, work summers training preparing, put hours are, averaged year, different salaried professional makes whole lot do. 

Stop shitting teachers.  imagining cushy high paying, give try.  Put student teaching hours see long last.  nothing like imagining. Excuse ü¶Ü Perfect.

Thanks link. match Worldometers 6530 delta peak, honestly looking [graph near daily cases, really early call over. 20% normal fluctuation, no? quick rant‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand far people still think negative test day two exposure means they‚Äôre clear. assumption probably largely responsible spread. amount patients encounter daily want test exposed yesterday need cleared work next day far many. 
 
Within family, sister covid fall 2020 mom got tested right away. Tested negative assumed fine symptoms started developing 5 days later. Retest positive. Thankfully stayed away caution, could‚Äôve easily spread us went initial negative test. many outs too, many chances save face.

For example, got FDA approval, could go ""Oh, alright, guess I'll get now"", literally one would bat eye, really. 

Like, I've got coworker apprehensive coming quickly - even FDA approval, she'd reasoned chance something bad happening due vaccine better getting virus leaving kids jam. 

And FDA approval made feel little better decision too, think.

That's takes, really. 

You even say ""I wrong"", much could say ""I reading/thinking, think right time get it.""  think UC system already required  vaccinated adult. made political reason exactly isn‚Äôt going work. deaths drop 100%? dead reanimating? make take information actually re-read primary source linked. listen you. That's get. misunderstood sure happens, going primary source brain always better someone reddit brain.

I give fuck much since linked source see actually read primary source. Neither jumped started arguing every comment thread like stalker. must angered small portion viewers. thinking realized doses likely people getting 3rd boosters. I‚Äôm hesitant think 100% doses new people getting vaccinated, although hope case. We've giving benefit doubt huge way entire pandemic. ok admit woefully incompetent. Scary, ok. No. triage. doctor best save patients one better chance survival get ICU one bed available. unless bed opens patients better chance survival. Man jealous. I‚Äôm NYC native moved San Diego years ago. maybe 3 bars entire city requiring vaccination, I‚Äôm eating indoors cases lower here. miss NYC much. Agreed  useless, data says specific thing can't necessarily used extrapolate inferences support.

It says exactly breakdown hospitalizations nothing really beyond that. would hope clear cut, general, yes! hospitals within rights refuse care want to. Freedom business serve want right?  replied farther basically they‚Äôre hard time don‚Äôt think anyone else happy they‚Äôre suffering. millions people haven‚Äôt horrific things happen last 18 months. Makes wonder kind person finds sad people ‚Äúannoying‚Äù happen feeling happy. got Pfizer shot able switch setup could knockout single shot I'd happy Biden directed Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services develop new regulation August 18, apparently still developing it. would bet money internal pushback agency hard vaccine mandate going cause massive staffing shortages kill people mandate would save. orphaned‚Ä¶ Small correction: 60% figure entire population, eligible population. eligible population (ages 12+) Israel 72% fully vaccinated, 83% least one dose. factors included well though.   believe means America, they, independent contractors, pay 100% premiums, pay much Americans Canada. incorrect way explain it, too?

920% higher chance death unvaccinated? 

600% higher chance hospitalization unvaccinated? Check chapter facebook groups nearby counties. signs print themselves. go counties school districts live brigade real life, organize brigades online, usually facebook, sometimes evites such.

Also check groups moms liberty. Whereas nationally moms liberty primary protagonist, every area group(s) like well. ""Let Play"" one.

Preventing sickness certainly kindness here. summer fantastic! Thanks clarifying, makes sense. 99% number seems little deceiving me... looking post now, people already complaining bad statistics then. point beating dead However, also catching COVID. know vaccines make even less likely.

I've heard efficacy numbers (of infection) dropping 50%, would make napkin math bit generous, point definitely stands. Thanks spelling out. frank, really care Howard Stern says God gives immune system protect illness including covid. still catch covid dying, that's God wants die. Follow God's die. clog hospitals seek treatments, God's will. doctors nurses evils save dying god's will. Thanks link, amazing see.

Yes, bioethics considerations, big deal sudden? cared international healthcare, we'd apply piddling billion two year provide sanitation nutrition aid developing countries. 

2,437 people died breakthrough infections August 30th. Admittedly worse affected kids (life-years impacted), worst year post-WWII polio deaths US 3,145. 2,437 people 9 months - 3500 year - matter, bother vaccinate polio? Chickenpox? diseases kill cripple fewer per year COVID killed vaccinated populations. totally makes sense. think problem I‚Äôm exactly you‚Äôre describing. everything uncertain gradual two steps forward one step back progression, it‚Äôs hard keep things perspective.

1. eligible people need vaccinated. Requiring vaccines certain activities employment going help make happen people.

2. Kids 12 need vaccine approved them, vaccine needs distributed.

3. People areas taking precautions need take precautions -- mask wearing, social distancing, washing hands, etc. little while.

4. need finalize booster plan. breakthrough cases severe enough require hospitalization rare, current thought seems able better distributing boosters.

Obviously, four happening overnight happen varying degrees. However let give scenario -- say COVID cases drop background noise area like summer fully vaccinated April. feel free go unmasked park eat restaurant? hospitals full, cases breaking records, breakthrough cases happening some, might feel comfortable things moment. least me, binary thing either everything 2019-normal 2020-COVID World. shifting, gradual thing. imagine light tunnel like daylight gradually bleeds view early morning time see more. means may different people. kids mostly act like still 2020-COVID World they're sitting ducks FDA approves vaccine them. single fully vaccinated, free ""normal"" things. studies done underfunded well controlled (or actively/unethically uncontrolled), show results right boundary significance. entirely possible, even likely, ivermectin slightly beneficial. could easily reduce risk 1-1.5 fold given early progression, comparable steroids (dex) late progression. IVM also excellent safety profile (in correct dosage), expensive. fairly damaging we're refusing prescribe crazy people OD horse dose, really drug criminalization.

Of course, 1.5-fold risk ratio quite marginal, nothing compared 15+ fold decrease risk vaccination. pushing ivm alternative vaccination actively causing death. We're going need Ebola-style, bleeding eyes, high mortality rate virus get everyone's attention.

Or.... terrorist releasing poison air. tend find money anti terrorism changes. passive vis-a-vis blatant lies COVID misinformation

One academic paper also enough provide consensus. threshold papers information become undeniable fact? 2? 5? 10? Information fluid thing, nothing ever 100% certainty. censor everything, free speech questioning important society.

Things like Bill Gates putting chips vaccines sure remove that, everything labelled 'disinformation' always I've noticed. Maybe that's jaded 45th's years made clear day governmental institutions like CDC political tool wielded time president pleases. Fauci yes man, he's able keep job like 5 presidents whatever now.

I knew four years face relentlessly, something I'll getting time soon.

It mistake one based science. maybe reason account idiots making worse, moment guidance changed, idiots made worse. like month ago CDC reversed course?

Anyway changed guidance misguided suggestions states mandates still effect buckled removed updated fall line CDC guidance. state R governor said got 70% vaccination we'd remove mandates. Well even close CDC announced updated guidelines. sure, local state CDC health departments every state get direction CDC really irresponsible move.

Also, Trump years teach CDC, like governmental institution, political tool wielded I'm sure wake that. say pee toilet seat anymore would anyone know me?

Unless misunderstood something study, think gets people *really* interested in: vaccinated people get COVID-19 infect others rate unvaccinated people get COVID-19?

It looks like study shows member household vaccinated, members household less likely get COVID-19. That's great, already well-established getting vaccinated significantly reduces odds getting COVID-19 first place. effect authors found study could simply vaccinated individuals getting COVID-19 therefore able transmit members household.

Thank you. yes, depressing thing people regret decisions many die it. It‚Äôs baffles mask wearing getting shot become political, things political wearing seatbelt. words, shouldn‚Äôt fucking political all. referring myself. I'm willing wait recommended 8 months, especially I'm young without high risk conditions, got Moderna seems holding better Pfizer Delta. concern Dad. He's 71 high risk conditions vaccinated Pfizer, going Isreal data Pfizer, wish could get booster now. going say immunocompromised get one, also always listens Doctor, told wait end November (he's around 6 months now, would 8 months) able get one. So... getting one unless CDC changes stance (they really allowing 65+ Pfizer get 5-6 months going data, Imo), seem like will, worrying. :( Damn! face like that, fat woman nothing smile about! OK, agree vaccine creation roll out, R0 number higher therefore death rate.

I suppose saying conspiracy theories continue anti vaxxers still prevalent, point view moved on, views add 30% + final death toll comment witty. 
I‚Äôm serious. 
At first misunderstood it, laughed. Yeah DC one worst summers years (hit average number 90+ degree days quite early year) cases didn‚Äôt explode. think weather definitely plays factor spread based impacts behavior probably overstated bit. There's wide disparities different nations UK. Looking ""UK total"" [their hospitalizations see whole UK slight upward trend right now. select ""By nation"" view toggle nations, England basically flat, Wales steadily rising, Scotland N. Ireland almost bad peaks.

This explained vaccinations, click [vaccinations look ""Vaccination uptake, report date"" nation, they're 86-90% uptake.

The thing makes sense England maybe Wales also higher levels natural immunity infections. can‚Äôt lift needle someone‚Äôs arm. 

But since care much, go volunteer hospital help men women risking lives save deliberate imbeciles. This, general, happened last year. think big thing wrestling teams neck woods MI. Unvaccinated different anti-vax, subset unvaccinated population happens particularly vile obnoxious. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd distinguish two you‚Äôre point admitted bravado gone you‚Äôre scared weak begging help. Maybe check social media see memes Fauci trying murder children vaccine something Saying lot w/o actually saying anything.... issue? someone ability get vaccine would've kept ICU, choose to, ethics issue denying ICU? Care go actually value life. Idaho became 50th state hit 45% population one dose. embarrassing, eastern European levels. Anyone Idaho explain hell going there?  point society agree switch Walking Dead rules engagement? Plenty people much needed surgeries postponed others ""opted out"" getting vaccinated. Instead hitting hospital making wrong choice, perhaps could drink pool water (for chloroquine?) spa converted budget Covid hospice. Jimmy Kimmel- ‚ÄúThat choice doesn‚Äôt seem tough me. Vaccinated person heart attack? Yes, come right in, we‚Äôll take care you. Unvaccinated guy gobbled horse goo? Rest peace, wheezy.‚Äù¬†  read around paywall?

Well mom still works (RN hospital). Dad retired, go week dinner go stores stuff. 


Yep housing delays killer, supposed done July sold old house (before knew delay) kinda stuck end month lol. agree parents laughed assholes, also going beyond science suggesting direct causal link person wearing mask person becoming infected. Though wearing mask properly makes transmission less likely, great valuable, infections still happen people wear masks, guaranteed person become infected person wearing mask (if fact source infection).

Please, wear mask, get vaccine, asshole, also please oversimplify causal relationships - cause problems road Jayden Kayden fill Aiden. Keep killing running teachers, who‚Äôs going teach new unaborted babies?  Masks don‚Äôt work? what? Something don‚Äôt believe exists? what‚Äôs problem? wear mask others don‚Äôt smell bad breath Hey need everyone get fully vaccinated, take boosters, social distance, wear K/N95 masks. We'll good go!

Yes, everyone get right that. bad ethical. 

Howard Stern speaking crazies earlier. big part audience. I've read lot places care want 3rd shot. make appointment go CVS something.  think, like countries, vaccinated elderly first group decreased antibodies, much time passed. elderly also risk death covid. Besides that, death rate still lower previous wave.

Taking mind I'm expert. way ends one part society lifts can‚Äôt hate anger way this. She‚Äôs invalid spreads negative energy wherever goes.  guarantee husband can‚Äôt stand her. Totally agree edit. Cheers to, hope get it.

I think lot younger redditors, w/o kids etc forget lot us parents zero reprieve covid issues last year half. somewhat carefree time summer people vaccinated delta rolled around, never came us still high alert keep kids safe. Except vaccination per-week numbers would say otherwise. We're vaccinating something like 1 million people per week. Obviously vax-hesitant. deny care?  offered health care already. declined it. people taking covid kids doctors offices? Get test. positive, call doctor. negative, call go doctor. Thank hard work, much respect. good hear many regret choice becoming sick. We've saying year. Half population part give damn. It‚Äôs spectrum. plenty kind, caring, soft spoken people mind business get tricked wind paying it. loudest obnoxious get attention assume they‚Äôre freak conspiracy weirdos. agree take 100%. seems almost criminal FDA Pfizer redo clinical trials based we're facing now, easily predicted back late July. I'm aware. That's wish Dad could get (71 several high risk conditions). He'll wait end November current recommendation. probably even less that, given 3.2% known test positive, subset cases. agree all. think CDC concerned anti-vax narrative goes next, think they'd make blatantly political decision. 

There simply evidence booster shots provide real long term benefits yet. studies seem cover first weeks vaccination, yeah expect infection rates drop sharply antibodies peaking. Mandate work home virtual learning, masks, well.


The old oppressive exploitation tolerable ""normal"" 

No stealing workers productivity obscenely manipulative controlling. taking precautions. meant people's logic. Antivaxers. claim vaccines offer protection catching COVID-19 vaccinated walking around without masks spreading everyone. entire debate really frustrating seems like debate somehow whether vaccines reduce transmission all, comment addresses.

Isn't real issue whether vaccinated still *significant spreaders*, however define that, even though obviously less transmissible unvaccinated? answer yes, vaccinated also need mask tested. Similar things VA recent week. Unvaccinated 13 times infection rate vs fully vaccinated (564 cases per 100K VS 43 cases per 100K think You‚Äôre overestimating human‚Äôs ability care. people pretty ‚Äúdone‚Äù covid. strong feeling next months year max, everyone going pretty much accept covid part life new flu. People get it, die, one really give much shit shutting limits more. Yeah I'm PA, girlfriend lives there, want representatives like him.

Except Lee Carter, like as-is.     Poor kid.  hope uses motivation kick ass school get away backwoods shithole. still responsibility take least reasonable precautions avoid getting infected also transmitting virus. Vaccination release us responsibility. Remember also people cannot vaccinated.

That said, people say probably careful that's point    extend state emergency lawmakers still pretend covid hoax.  girlfriend tested positive covid today, negative test yesterday. Last time saw 2 days ago, negative lateral flow today wondering leaving house see friends? said back May look now...NO one expected Delta. believe see it.

... yeah, anti-vaxx/anti-mask people seem reeeeeeeeally healthy head.

Disgusting. they‚Äôll right putting unvaccinated people ‚Äúfema camps.‚Äù  pigs could fly

... look up. Come internet. need find woman laughing background  Yes start calling smart people ""nerds"" ""geeks"" derogatory terms. 

The whole attitude towards intellectualism America created disaster said, going get worse. ""11% protection"" bit misleading there. individual protection.

If read actual paper:

**42.3% people wearing surgical masks** reduced number cases 11% percent. surgical masks 11% effective mean, vaccination lead people relaxed indirectly may cause uptick infection numbers way love Brian Sims. He‚Äôs like model politicians be. Railing injustice clear, understandable language. damn good sense humor too! Remember everyone shitting data Israel? What's difference now? transparent, corrected Simpsons Paradox whatever, positive? Serious question. Thank kind person!  nursing program school damn hard get (only know cause went someone nursing student) holy hell morons getting nursing programs. 

You cannot tell people lack basic critical thinking skills pass courses.. can't... how???  Surprisingly, economy *literally* run human sacrifice.

Probably covered difference ""literal"" ""figurative"" better school. Whoops. would evidence all? even question? one fun one, since Pfizer contain weakened virus even allow potential happen. need live-attenuated vaccine even create potential viral shedding occur. happen, often feces pretty low risk  Yep. 6 months Pfizer 10/9. I'll approved then. grandmother got 5-month mark, immunocompromised sure shit fine. So..

The vaccines going waste anyway. Islam doesn‚Äôt allow vaccines. Pfizer vaccine created Muslim Turkish-German couple.  Bigger concern infected kids contagious. delta really good breakthrough infections prolonged exposure. kids get school, take home give mom dad grandma grandpa, we're dealing much serious problem, potentially, especially give anyone vaccinated.

Imagine entire country size Netherlands died 1.5 year exactly it, drives crazy people try point masks don‚Äôt work ‚Äúliberal‚Äù areas get bad. doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs never given chance tested somewhere 30-60% people basically given state won‚Äôt participate. would great could get booster built delta strain School nurses near estimated working 15 hours day assisting contact tracing covid related measures. Ah yes, classic ""don't poor"" approach. Never fails. you‚Äôre US Europe, Muslim doctors over-represented medical field. Immigrant parents, especially Muslim parents, push kids healthcare. research. pushback vaccination schedule currently recommended doctors CDC emerged primarily upper middle class well-educated communities. rooted distrust government relationship pharmaceutical companies, well recent trend pursuing supposedly natural lifestyles. Doctors point entitled mentality prevalent among patients Internet era; begin feel though complete freedom control medical lives online research empowers enables debate medical theory physicians.

This.   really bad 2nd wave people took precautions. looks like pre covid times.... looks like thr 3rd wave coming soon .  following CDC guidelines know kid close contact unmasked unvaccinated student, sat close lunch 15 minutes more. Contact tracing little lax many places, still can't keep up. seasonal? gets cold northeast everyone inside starts tick up? smirking poop bag behind him.  hatred eyes kid lose grandmother.  self-righteousness displaying disgusting. bet goes church too.  Well, could possible totally right?! little shitcunts fully grown adults. University Antelope Valley. got trouble students take government grants pay classes owners college pocketing money. still accredited, refer fake school. Essentially, makes body respond virus like kid's, people stealth vectors transmission.

So yes, hat's probably happening ‚Äî extent, certainly, less restrictions (which affecting vaccinated, notice symptoms, unvaccinated, care risk others.)

He's also ignoring fact unvaccinated likely spread virus unmasked, coughing, higher viral load longer mild case.

All point elephant room: there's really, really easy fix ""problem."" Many parents may think burned tele learning, see constantly flipping distance learning quarantine coming back class better all.    ‚ÄúAdults‚Äù joke? Can't fire them?    Could reason I‚Äôm bigger person? Kinda chubby kinda muscular broad shoulders. 

I should‚Äôve asked dunno thinking mean, even believe absolute nonsense, get vaccine avoid getting contaminated us vaccinated people?

It's like claim COVID-19 bio-weapon released China. Well, okay, believe bio-weapon get vaccine stops killing you?

I starting see people manage accidentally kill guns allegedly bought protect others. grand scheme things, younger generation key herd immunity. generation worry coronaviruses everyone young. Like chickenpox. reason masks stupid nobody actually uses correctly, restaurants stupid. Like wear table immediately take off? Also bars even comply, beer hand good. Shits dumb af. interesting finding. Hardly surprising, unfortunately effect small.

With said, kind suspect smaller effect getting partial ""buy in"" masking. Masks work like shield wall, shields locked together, fewer weaknesses attackers get behind lines. found increasing ""mask wall"" reduced infections, real question whether linear increase exponential - could get 42% people wear surgical grade better masks, would see greater 1/3 ratio reduced infection percentage increased mask percentage?

Vaccination still better, either/or proposition. Defense depth. numerous symptoms, altered sense smell taste one them. even runny nose. 


Does automatically rule COVID virus out, confirmed cases smell taste affected?  heard term weeks ago, ‚Äòsocial murder‚Äô using this. Though originally used economic classes creating situations kill other, less privileged classes, term starting gain traction describe people writing disabled/chronically ill/elderly etc. convenient. number times told ‚Äòjust learn live with‚Äô virus produce immunity fault thinking moving country becoming hermit.  It‚Äôs still great metric though. vaccinated portion population grows, breakthrough infections make increasingly large fraction total infections. population 90% vaccinated, even half infections among vaccinated would fantastic. We‚Äôre treating P(vaccinated|infected) proxy P(infected|vaccinated), Bayes‚Äô Theorem shows estimate factor P(infected)/P(vaccinated). usual measure efficacy works clinical trials experiment designed accommodate sorts unknowns. It‚Äôs great measure wild. say ""fairly certain"" already got COVID. Perhaps that's case, perhaps - there've number people studies also pretty sure never antibodies. So, gotten antibody test? readily available least last year; could verify whether it. (Yes, antibody titers might low even still B- T-cell immunity, means checked last fall.)

If COVID, yes, likely get side effects vaccine. But, framing ""adverse effects"" best way look it. likely get *short-term* side effects go away quickly; far know, significantly likely get *long-term* side effects vaccine.  need locked up. get rekt anti-vaxxers 1000 minutes 16 hours 40 minutes  Depends long Boy Scouts troop woods Yeah except fact selfish idiots never part  Depends, what's limit? fired anything general category ""covid"" longer protected MA. say, fired testing positive, can't collect got it. always living indiana problem me.

The difference behavior something choose race/ sexual orientation/gender not.   County School Board members called emergency meetings mask issue, deliberately include public comments agenda special meetings require unless requested board member approved majority. Then, meeting starts one make motion add public comments meeting agenda, conveniently group antimaskers speak. essentially staying way make seem like antimaskers majority anywhere near advertising meeting including public comments keep support mask wearing home watching live stream cable access. Obviously, like said, normal people also want room unmasked unvaccinated people anyway.   WTF talking about? voted Biden lol. worse outbreak hospitalizations time last year. least thousand people dying everyday. country, presidency, etc, handled terribly. administration guilty optimistic declaring soon. CDC steps behind every point. one can't get political blinders off. Face it, things going well.

EDIT: BTW, question CDC different before? Oh that‚Äôs hilarious. Yea mans b locked lmao  Someone analysis last time released delta data accounting age percentages vaccinated, efficacy vaccine still pretty high. Okay, Chief. one month Olympics ended many athletes died Covid? worry child, adults one sent hospice treated kids. one visit decided cut form empathy understanding. die alone still blame everyone else unwilling take hard look themselves. I'm immunosuppressant psoriasis I'm getting third shot pfizer today. 5G me.  that's pretty shitty pay teachers do. good teachers working lot 9 months working longer hours professions.

and getting expensive college degree.  even see two marks blood  I‚Äôd assume immune compromised, can‚Äôt generate strong memory cell response, we‚Äôre seeing cases extreme elderly. don‚Äôt see someone asthma wouldn‚Äôt able generate strong immune response.    Ok, let's assume grandma home two weeks zero contact anyone. visitor came without mask. visitor later tested positive covid grandma also got sick. Well, could pretty positive got from, STILL say sure, visitor wearing mask, caught it.

My point simply say ""my grandma died someone wearing mask"" emotional argument really hold up. Probably depends contract. University near mandated students staff due union contract. world peace would achieved people stopped people. actionable advice, expert?  also wonder many kids mind wearing mask, really embarrassed parents acting.  Well context compared terrible mask usage horrendous mask usage. 9% reduction going treatment areas (42% usage) vs non treatment areas (13% usage). scientist also speculated treatment area would've also asymptomatic cases tested, would improve number.  Hey, man, get front room full rabid Tennesseans take ‚Äúcon‚Äù argument face. It‚Äôs easier said done. folks straight unpredictable. Honestly standard track women's menstrual hormonal cycles drug research. definitely people can't handle working home. rest us, it'd nice could treated like adults left alone get work done without hour commuting every day.  shit infuriates experiences, local government meetings crazier Parks Rec depicted (used work tech school board meetings). seemed like different needle, trying look away believe pulled another package Man struck home. true idiots breeding. It‚Äôs becoming apparent vaccinated individuals transmit much lower rate- surprise hardly immunologists.

1) viral loads bunch deactivated virus them. confirmed via studies cultured viral loads (Netherlands study comes mind). 

2) viral loads decrease much faster vaccinated individuals. clear virus faster infectious shorter duration.

Anyone telling vaxxed individuals spread virus well unvaxxed individual lying convince they‚Äôre selfish blow hards getting vaccinated. I‚Äôm ‚Äúquarantining‚Äù I‚Äôm going go show room full shouting people opposed vaccines masks.

If vaccinated E. coli still wouldn‚Äôt go swimming cess pit.   That's sure sign he's something right.  would deny control freak bosses existence Yea smallpox covid similar adults adults.    So, we'll never return level normalcy. almost seem.... deplorable. There‚Äôs going entire generation kids whos mental health destroyed dealing this. fucking mental health crisis Ride like you‚Äôve never experienced. difference telling someone dont need social distance coughing oh wait isn‚Äôt one

remember respect choices people NEED social distance even mask on

if dont know thats quite sad    I'd say guys going went LA. high vaccination rates high natural immunity, peaked weeks ago already. sure school openings bring. feel like trend denser urban areas. Which, laymen knowledge, feels promising.   cover idea vaccinating religious reasons. brother dad doctors (we Jewish), save life Yom Kippur, holiest day year, would peace services even day like that. Saving life and/or others paramount.  Fuck cuntholes. haven‚Äôt heard vaccines contain aborted fetal cells, know certain Regeneron every conservative covid chugging right absolutely derived aborted fetal cells.  wonder many even kids local schools. 

I know Tennessee meetings, loudest protester weren‚Äôt local didn‚Äôt even kids. earth would person prove get vaccine? Sure, there's plenty. first couple Google jabbed separate times needle? almost schoolboard town/county meeting attracts craziest people. beyond paid shills infest things, think many public meetings free time go to, actually wanted attend. consider mentality someone says ""you know I'm going innane debate strong feelings this"".

parks rec tried exaggerate meetings, reality, often nearly crazy. actually dire topics normal people attending getting see madness. friend mine went one friend parent his, nearly PTSD it.   think 99% us endure misery forever protect ones can't wear mask. 

Here's thing people like - get talking part dealing pandemic like (wearing masks, distancing, vaccines, quarantine, etc) people use words like ""endure misery forever"" makes everything sound dramatic. 

I'm curious many people actually think go forever. certainly don't. I'm trying survive roll happening things develop. know everything covid. end date pandemic. Yes, people tired. x,y,z things correctly mean pandemic ends anyone else. people throwing around words like forever makes dramatic help. using ""forever"" excuse throw one's hands say whatever convenient - ""I'm anymore"" ""I care kid disability"". conversation loved ones.

According data UK, fully vaccinated 90-year-old faces roughly similar risk profile unvaccinated 60-year-old (0.12%). thing 80-year-old, whose vaccinated risk profile close unvaccinated 50-year-old. calculate vaccine effectiveness different age groups, find different picture. ages, rate severe cases 3.1x higher unvaccinated individuals fully vaccinated individuals, becomes much higher break finer groups: 

* age group 50-59, vaccine 94.2% effective severe disease, chances hospitalized 5.4x greater unvaccinated
* age group 60-69, vaccine 93.2% effective severe disease, chances hospitalized 12.5x greater unvaccinated
* age group 70-79, vaccine 95.6.6% effective severe disease, chances hospitalized 20.3x greater unvaccinated
* age group 80-89, vaccine 90.7% effective severe disease, chances hospitalized 18.3x greater unvaccinated
* age group 90+, vaccine 93.5% effective severe disease, chances hospitalized 30.4x greater unvaccinated

Make religion say requires whatever self-serving bullshit imagine. like religion proven true get religious exemptions. Eh, personally know antivaxxers look reasonably healthy somewhat in-shape.

Never mind US several states higher vaccination rates Israel. 

Never hear peep crowd place like Portugal, much higher vaccination rates, surprise surprise, cases/deaths declining ""peak"" summer much lower previous spike. Even numbers mind way higher thought makes feel like idiot getting vaccine early. Even number 3x higher without vaccine

I idea argument trying make. There‚Äôs study needs happen check antibodies, they‚Äôve able time. seem push rapid test. Also another cash cow.

Mocked morons That's 1:20 reverse split. suppose flu like symptoms describe it. rash identifying features. kinda are‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sad come this.

It months later saw surge. Yet came across regions time.

Does anyone actually good record predicting surges occur? paraphrase favourite Bob Newhart joke:

""I like science-deniers, mean denigrate are. people science-deniers, ""denigrate"" means ""put down"". They're using Sinovac, trials done around 3k kids believe, voting divided, 5 favor, 2 favor 12-17, 1 vote expanding eligibility.

Plus, there's tons people stuck abusive homes (domestic abuse rising hidden side effect pandemic) may able leave easily need out. think hybrid would probably good middle ground, people able option completely remote reach certain tenure career. There's data support putting boosters, inevitable infections result would preventable breakthrough cases. may many hospitalizations group, little data seems indicate somewhat limited protection long covid breakthrough cases. rolling boosters general population, essentially conducting experiment find breakthrough cases really mean peoples overall health. mention impact hospitals already overworked understaffed. Imagine small hospital loses key staff critical subspecialty due breakthrough case, even COVID ""just cold"" impact peoples health could huge. Yeah, I've seen. sure even started trials 1-5 group, they? I‚Äôm afraid always case. can‚Äôt move society continue require vaccinated people test isolate 10+ days even they‚Äôre asymptomatic incredibly mild symptoms. Life can‚Äôt function way. 

The way approach testing likely unsustainable. balance number days post exposure‚Äî necessarily developing symptoms‚Äî problematic. Additionally, amount community spread, people likely getting exposed time (and cases, vaccine working!) Article says homegrown vaccines. think biggest key able to. families still refusing‚Ä¶. Well it‚Äôs harsh it‚Äôs they‚Äôre problem. can‚Äôt keep wearing masks limiting lives much longer, time move on. People get left behind get sick die end day‚Ä¶ would happen matter it‚Äôs problem. sucks comes kids, much they‚Äôre able get vaxxed. Hell no. Hands public healthcare.

It's **very** slippery slope start this. easy go next risky behavior, 'Oh, speeding got car accident? owe half medical bills.' 'Oh broke arm ice fishing ice slippery? Half medical bill please.'

Eroding medical system way tackle this. No, no, no! candy. Ohio's [vaccine breakthrough updated track week week. I've screenshotting keeping track past weeks:

**Hospitalizations**

In past week 1079 hospitalizations, 104 vaccinated. means 90% hospitalizations among unvaccinated.

**Deaths**

There also 146 deaths, 7 vaccinated. means 4.79% vaccinated died. 


**Week week breakdown**

Ugh worked music venue Florida Tuesday exact requirements, demanded artist. personally administered 70 rapid tests patrons vaccine card, negative test. venue able comply artist's requests. one cares think either still comment opinion. want make ignorant sarcastic comment probably goes misinformation policies, even though it'd obvious satire most.

Going leave clearly disagree opinion upsetting   Yup! toddler leave car mask on. Yet adults told put one one they‚Äôre already inside store. issue turning away take time resources people less selfish they, *also* grave danger, could benefit survive. major religion forbids vaccination. undoubtedly splinters do. pandemic may well cause significant tightening loophole, evangelical pastors selling exemption letters 'minimal donation'. heavily GOP SC perhaps not.  Put land mine. think case many people quarantining/isolating 'normal' deaths like cars accidents reduced side effect covid measures. Or, well, that's guess. knows, culture might ""if can't overcome hoax virus, qualified team"". nothing alarming end day That's excuse. consume information via algorithm. go look actual information. see CDC saying, directly. see scientific data, directly. 

If unwilling that, purposefully ignoring truth. degrees bad, they're bad point. Well is, brought replied it. it‚Äôs okay, can‚Äôt answer question actual sound reason, nbd. 100% false. Doctors don‚Äôt creed much anymore. lot doctors don‚Äôt even take oath days. Hippocratic oath ethics standard isn‚Äôt even relevant healthcare anymore generally refer various healthcare laws like malpractice. 

Doctors every right deny patient medical care. Employment law reinforces this. one _forced_ work. Maybe countries are, cause pressure? really seem taking time. Yes, completely understandable.

What saying, enough space, doctors still dent treatment individual unvaccinated infected COVID-19?

The reason ask idea accepted reading, asking thoughts.  vaccine getting? curious, maybe missed article. may looked up. get care urgent care clinic, dr know unless tell them. reduced 75% vaccination, different CDC's (IIRC?) 99% reported earlier.

Our data Canada closer CDC number. Around 95% Ontario last week. (Note numbers high enough tiny confidence intervals)

I believe study may grouped single vaccinated individuals double vaccinated individuals.

I believe included flaccidly ineffective(against Delta) J&amp;J vaccine well. Ok, feel like disparaging goatees feel you. (A large) part wants COVID wean assholes (especially lady laughing viral video kid speaking grandmother died COVID) rest us get back lives. Like I'm sorry longer want suffer anxiety depression related isolation pandemic (19 months going strong) people want something takes 2 days life (this even including waiting side effects subside). know people give damn isolate socially distance long gone back pretending COVID exist.

Just lucky, guess? We've come together society determine things harm people around you. getting vaccine different?

Because examples, passed laws require specific behavior, e.g. cocaine consumption. things done democratic country rule law. way come together society determine things passing laws. 

So far, laws require vaccines? laws forbid freedom encourage people **not** get vaccinated? long laws, people free act according beliefs. mom may immune. individuals get even high levels exposure.

This full nationwide vaccine mandate, may somewhat uncharted territory. question enforcement. Otherwise, see lot shitty places try bypass this. read article. much mandate sense federal government literally forcing people get shot. 

The first part creating policy federal workers must get vaccinated terminated. Since head executive branch, authority set guidelines like that.

The second part instructing contractor business federal government make policy within companies. companies want business federal government, need comply policy. already tons policies contactors must agree to.

The third part instructing OSHA implement policy requires employer 100 employees require vaccinations testing. penalty fine. policy may may constitutional, depending whether type regulation within scope Congress given agency. Time get vaccinated..def going get time weekly testing. basically, get ton inconveniences vaxxed vs. small perks do. Yet another odd response reveals complete lack interest good-faith discussion. first part paper details history use Ivm. sources refer section. I‚Äôm guessing know that, don‚Äôt care.

So, yes, significant drop breakthrough infections time Delta dominant. would reducing breakthrough infections not, uhh, reduce breakthrough infections? Breakthrough infections normal expected, preventing large percentage could impactful, care things like long covid, staffing hospitals critical industries.

I'd much rather live country people vaccinated lined get shots, would safer everyone, live place, live US. course, unvaccinated driving infections, even marginal improvement people vaccinated better nothing, especially comes protecting people already 2 doses 6+ months ago. perfect, realistically, least domestically, we've got.

It's long past time Americans start taking pubic health seriously. mean, given they're talking study performed *rural Bangladesh*, would take $100 bet vaccination numbers pretty low nonexistent. looks like 2 3 months 6 months study, mass vaccination happening yet country, period. study began Nov 2020, mass vaccination began Feb 2021. [They individual compliance, general mask wearing compliance social distancing major public gathering areas (mosques, markets, village entrances, tea stalls, etc.) whatever spread reduction they're getting little observed besides change behavior public risk scenarios.

No show worth creating new cluster. Americans raised believe ""freedom"" means ""I whatever hell want without regard anyone else."" inconvenience oppression. social responsibility communism. brave champions liberty refuse common-sense public safety measures pandemic. 

In short, lots ""exceptionalism"" propaganda lack critical thinking skills taught public school. employers federal contracts? No, kids get exposed, get sick, become immune, grow generation immune covid, pass along kids, it'll over.

But, aiming administer booster shots eight months second dose two-dose vaccines. 

I suppose they've answered secret data that's leading defy public data timeframe? Pointy stick life-saving vaccine it. Also way employers screen lack logical thinking skills much plot twist slow (weeks months) convergence outcomes. risk group receive it, absolutely so. case seems nothing lose. 

If not, *probably* much difference. Whether get breakthrough infection now, year now, 2 shots, 3 shots, typically mild infection, require clinical treatment, recover. 

But getting track; original comment point think CDC worrying anti-vaxxers authorized boosters yet. Likely they're waiting data. Well, 100 million people got ticking clock getting vaccinated already. There's also nothing says vaccinated people ones creating variants. miserable person talk to. portion opting weekly testing instead. Vaccine mandates settled law literal centuries. accepted constitutional back smallpox inoculation 2% fatality rate, they‚Äôre certainly constitutional vaccine safe. welcome at-will employment. first time? Beyond vaccines helping prevent spread, also reduce severity infection/chance hospitalization. many hospitals over-encumbered due COVID vaccines help reduce hospital utilization COVID patients allows need non-COVID care access services (see articles gunshot victims waiting long time treatment due COVID surges hospitals). fuck going about? original L strain seen since October 2020, means 99.9999% chance extinct.

No isn't. peak Israel's September-October 2020 surge, number deaths, hospitalizations, severely ill patients, higher peak current surge, despite: 
1. Much restrictions last year, including prolonged lockdown (today Israel practically fully open). 
2. much less infectious variant (no Delta). 


The difference almost entirely due vaccines + natural immunity, allowed Israel remain almost entirely open go another lockdown, still keeping hospitalizations max capacity.   though still catch Covid double vaccinated?

If BMI 40, *can* still run mile (or train without losing half bodyweight). much, much less likely someone BMI 20.

Banning unvaccinated mean suddenly zero risk COVID; vaccinated catch COVID less frequently, milder symptoms less time, even similar viral loads.

That means:

1. Vaccinated travellers feel safer likely buy tickets;
2. airline taking unnecessary risk allowing unvaccinated travellers (who chance infected, remaining infected, spreading disease others);
3. airline less likely sued passengers get sick, taken precautions - passengers get sick also less likely suffer serious consequences, meaning less inclined bother suing, payout would less airline found liable).

So case, banning unvaccinated, airline gets happier customers spending money, less likely see flights cancelled due super-spreader events, less likely get sued fact. 

Why seem think either risk, isn't: eliminated risk, anything worthless? That‚Äôs matter interpretation suppose. take comment way all. took referencing single event original post about.  Come Chicago. great.  Sounds like Biden announce speech later today US Federal workers contractors required get vaccinated Per dude hit ""Those get three shots attend survey said never caught covid-19.""

/s can't wait reckoning coming way. I've people.  SMH.

fucking internet raised Christian Science. Generally people don‚Äôt vaccinate children. Mother Church stated follow government recommendations don‚Äôt ask people either way (in words, still remote services). Hell yeah.

For antivax covid enthusiasts, HIPAA apply   Wow thought vaccines weren‚Äôt working Israel. telling people making claims without actual evidence proof data back up??? also huge summer surge traditionally fall/winter virus - RSV. Maybe that‚Äôs contributing ‚Äúnormal winter busyness‚Äù. Muslims pro-vaccine pro-science... believe Pfizer vaccine actually created Muslim Turkish couple. large chunk medical doctors Muslim.

Bullshit. yes muslim country large chunk medical doctors muslim, like large chunk medical doctors country country *shock* *gasp* really encouraging see high vaccination rates finally make difference plateaued sharp increase.  Yea, that‚Äôs OP presented it. said stay home can‚Äôt spread covid.

Also, even one 10, 16. said hours, novel headline, happen ER. Maybe said average wait times multiply fourfold something like that. issue ""vaccinated spread same."" true. vaccinated spread it, far far less. Further, time COVID spends active infected, vaccinated person also going less, therefore less chance mutate.

Also, there's overwhelming issue unvaccinated people flooding ICUs, therefore preventing people otherwise treatable conditions getting treatment. People dying due lack healthcare. 

We're planet together, affects other.  ""Jesus, imagine thinking Thanksgiving February!""  things equal, relative risk 4:1 unvacinated:

  (50/20)/(50/80)  = 4
  50% cases 20% people vs 50% cases 80% people.
Or, looked another way 20% unvacinated many cases 80%, group 4 times larger.

Of course, unvacinated likely younger, healthier, less vulnerable real relative risk likely much higher. insane, really think that, police qualified immunity military doesn't? saying military should, police *definitely* *not.* Good That's choir boys for! school cafeterias open. mask mandates world mean shit 40-minute maskless free all. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Totally agree need keep studying getting long covid, long often, caveat know 'long' lasts vaccinated individuals. lot scientists follow hunch even \*do\* get long covid vaccination likely *as long* severely unvaccinated. course dealing large numbers people there's always going exceptions something keep mind weighing risks. say personally still masking taking precautions foreseeable future - it'll really interesting see plays especially people start getting boosters. tell lot someone enemies are. bibliography lacking though  little taught kids obnoxious shitcunts adults level-headed, wise people. exchange showed otherwise.

I'd include shadow-immunity people unvaccinated group list. think may even important reason. would say checklist indicators death. heart still going breathing enabled way oxygen still getting brain, ready vulture food yet. know Pants Fire, minor critique headline containing phrase ""No evidence"".

""No evidence"" evokes something ranging ""We guessing could true, can't prove yet"" ""we idea either way"".

Yeah, talking context going rowdy school board meetings. hanging vaxxed friends now.

Everyone get vaccinated try go hospital w COVID illness bottom priority list. bed go dumbass decided vaccinate. chose get deal w illness. Tired restrictions. Meanwhile governor running around fighting anyone wants make harder teachers die... ok.  That's poor pay relative education level. 

Also, teachers regularly asked work past salaried work hours, also getting significant pay raises past two decades so. source shows this. Average salary 0.2% higher adjust inflation.  America doesn‚Äôt want thoughtful, empathetic citizens. 

America wants mouth-foaming entitled white women screaming color sky wrong media whips frothy frenzy. weeks, bill arrives. gone digital begin with. whole thing mess.  increase mask usage 29% (from 13 42) resulted 11% drop risk translates 1% drop risk every 2.9% increase mask usage. would make 33% percent effective. 

I doubt effectiveness masks way explain findings particular study room improvement. important approve US people get end year holidays.  going write 'so fail see issue here', decided not. üòÇ tired hearing ""negative tests unvaccinated"".

Still better ""masks unvaccinated"" indoor policy without verifying vaccination status one wears masks. mean also case like March April.

One day mandate take effect, school removed physician's signature part. Suddenly mommy daddy saying child medical condition enough.

What studies? studies like correct methodologies, post them?

The link posted contains assertion things equal, younger ages, see 100-fold differences risk depending presence absence preexisting conditions.

But, obesity example, [a report CDC's Morbidity Mortality Weekly says patients 65 BMI 45 2.01 adjusted risk ratio death. lot studies show that, certainly nowhere near 100 times. 

I certainly seen studies putting presence preexisting condition 100 fold risk young people.  reflection Rutherford County.

I'm rural area, there's still 3,000 students local K-12 school. school board year decided masks optional. They've since seen huge uptick COVID cases, students optioned wear masks...obviously. Parents sending symptomatic kids school, even confirmed tested positive. decided make masks optional significant portion school district's population comprised anti-mask, anti-vax parents. say that, course, that's exactly that's school board tends work. Whatever decision going piss least amount people, regardless repercussions. Last year mask requirements, full remote learning, hybrid learning. year...""Let's pretend like COVID went away thing anymore! Delta variant? What's that?""

Last year large group parents create Facebook group, organize street-side demonstrations protest students potentially wear masks went back school. felt parents decision whether child wears mask day long. Yet previously, made sure kids vaccination requirements public school first place, fine past school making whatever decisions needed child there.

Idk keep acting like people access internet they're source information. know boosters lmao think something there. want go backwards? ""normal"" seem miss collection circumstances made pandemic absolute horrorshow be.

""Normal"" inadequate financial aid people put work. ""Normal"" understaffing hospitals underpaying staff. ""Normal"" dependence fragile global supply chains. 

Fuck that, want go *back* normal; want society learn fucking lessons whole experience develop new, better normal. plausible vaccinated people living life like it‚Äôs prepandemic, could ultimately better protected future infection since likely exposed virus overtime. so, increases antibodies still benefit likely protected vaccine. 

Whereas, got vaccinated didn‚Äôt contact virus since then, wouldn‚Äôt antibodies weaker? 

I‚Äôm saying true, I‚Äôm simply asking plausible scenario. already know everyone part. Karens along male non binary entitled counterparts continue scream masks, social distancing vaccines like entire time. Firing someone job comes mind. That's typical; may something else going on.

This opinion, think probably biggest part one choose getting third dose either ~three months first two done seems trigger another good immune response help ensure longer lasting/stronger protection. equate reason pretty much childhood immunizations 3-4 total shots, last dose usually months previous ones.  I'm sure lot testing went childhood ones determine schedule, unfortunately due dire urgency COVID ones rushed without luxury, probably assume logic both.

Personally think giving protection going Pfizer third dose though. take semi-quantitative antibody test Labcorp offers right three weeks third Pfizer dose see antibody levels high, numbers prove certain level protection, count highest threshold test felt confident seeing that. good bit recent studies done correlated persons higher antibody levels much less likely end severe symptoms/being hospitalized, cases totally asymptomatic antibodies/immune system able neutralize virus replicate much cause severe issues.

USA obesity yet don‚Äôt want socialized healthcare bc think wait Canada?? What's worse spike hospitalizations among kids. 5-10x since mid June. Basically percentage kids get Delta Variant go hospital die previous variants, since Delta spreads much easier lot kids getting cumulative pediatric hospitalization rate much higher. personally believe fact protected kids much last year plays role too. 'Vaccination status' something else lost protection too. in, like got 5g shot, fired  shit sherlock Given recent exponential rises cases we've seen highly-vaccinated countries, I'm convinced vaccines particularly effective limiting infections/transmissions (whilst **are** clearly effective reducing risk hospitalisation/death vulnerable people). 

That's separate discussion though, I'd prefer derail question asked it. powerful message.   Taking perhaps disqualifies one career disinformation. Yep. would reinfect burning through, virus would mutate become less deadly problem. Oklahoma's [weekly dropped morning.

I don‚Äôt want overwork immune system. current, time kids get final outcomes. relationship testing scores adult outcomes like cholesterol levels heart attacks. One often predicts other, always. actually need wait couple years things get back normal order see whether kids catch up. 

My original statement stands: absolutely zero evidence kids catch delay. Eh idk. Everyone old enough get vaccine household fully vaxxed still worry it. friends whose breakthrough infections still made pretty sick miserable.   That's correct. That's we're insisting masks, even vaccinated. could contagious vaccinated person, never show symptoms. vaccine like seat belt. protects accident, greatly reduces chances severe injury death considerably, can't save 100% time. seriousness, disagree. masks effective, particular, N95s, lesser extent, KN95s. Even surgical masks likely still impact transmissibility. point, vaccines effective, asking everyone mask speaks concerns delta's high R0 vaccines effective. Even cloth mask 20% effective, that's still better mask. lessened still possible risk infection transmission breakthroughs, duty mask protect others.

Unless people masking properly, got both, see plenty that. bananas. kids' district mask mandate following recommended mitigations averaging 8-10 cases per week total, district 5000. 

One interesting thing I've noticed literally every single case one son's highschool (where kids old enough vaccinated). one case I'm aware far daughter's elementary. Well , ill share experience. started body ache soon low grade fever. moment decided isolate wear face mask wildcraft w95 ( N95 mask like). drove testing center mom also , also exposed infected person. dint show signs symptoms us mask kept car windows door. tested positive mom negative PCR test .

I'm 50 years old believed life people generally good, outside outliers. opinion steadily trending downward though past 2 years reached ATL.  sound like you‚Äôre fun parties. This. People need realize you‚Äôre looking yearly boosters.  That‚Äôs fine feel way. change things Congress.

Living life interacting people also help immune system fight *every pathogen* exists outside covid. know many people got colds allergies second let un-lock down? Sitting indoors constantly sanitizing everything makes weak susceptible everything.  Yes! saw someone posting blatant misinformation claimed correct nurse, even showed proof misinformation. Watch worldometer stats, way many countries. Israel hasn‚Äôt hit anywhere near 20k day. first second shot Moderna dosage, pointing anyone reads later. Moderna booster dosage submitting approval second shot dosage, 50ug, first shot dosage 100ug. likely going issues end getting 100ug dose booster, providing context. Covid vaccine messed cycle. shot made pmdd pretty bad.     household, we've gone couple ""colds"" presented one secondary symptoms Covid. Sneezing, runny nose, etc. fevers, coughing. result, got covid test one kids croup. 

It's entirely possible we've covid infections know covid. also mask indoors outside home, wife vaccinated. There's still scary amount time contagious show symptoms. Regardless vaccine status. you‚Äôre home day, pod 2-3 local sensible families? Nextdoor, community bulletin boards, parent groups - must follow reasonably safe practices kid swaps meetups. hours day 2-3 kids times week (outside good weather, somewhere suitable house not) better classrooms every day full risky kids.

My local art museum grounds tiny neighborhood pocket parks popular places that, I‚Äôve seen posts community looking compatible kids. Thanks, I'd rather base decision careful risk analysis, rather ""Bro, get vaccine"". ""really simple"", clear data support it, somebody able share me. GIT GIT GIT IT! yay! meds working well psoriasis? irony kids last 2 decades told parents shouldn‚Äôt trust everything read internet, kids applied advice/warning‚Ä¶.but parents went trust every crazy thing read internet. good enough. needs action state boards nursing. Bro, get vaccine.

In short, you‚Äôre young healthy, neither covid vaccine presents real risk you, odds you‚Äôll fine. even minuscule odds, you‚Äôre much likely complications covid vaccine - selfish reason. Also, places situations requiring vaccine proof participate.

And overall moral reason it‚Äôll help protect others help us get fuck mess. You‚Äôre currently selfishly relying everyone else got vaccine ability go bars, travel, whatever else enjoy. 

It‚Äôs really simple.  rated pants fire. Headlines summaries abstracts. using summaries that's reading comprehension issue part. RN here. hope well. one considers Mormonism major religion, started Jenner first inoculated people smallpox, around 30-40 years. (inoculations around 1796, Joseph Smith ""finding"" golden tablets 1820s) Mormons support vaccination, sort international immunization program part missions, think. fuckssake, dude.

I've seen stories countries dropping restrictions thanks high vaccination good compliance: Denmark, Finland, Portugal. It‚Äôs going regional. decent vaccine rates massive numbers prior infections, places like NYC fine. high number adults immune here, delta basically nothing even though bars restaurants packed every night like college town. FYI, Melbourne Australia:

I knew someone avoided paying penalty health insurance claiming Pastafarianism stating health insurance religion. never got trouble it. 


It's glorified honor system. Christian Scientists, Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses come mind Plenty vaccines required kids attending school. reason one well. Holy appropriate Rick Morty moment:

&amp;#x200B;

That one awesome amazing kid.  pharmacist gave one shot ‚Äúpuncture‚Äù arm vaccine, normal? got second shot Pfizer morning remember that, also came back week. Bruh I‚Äôm pro vax mask, still quarantining?!?! pretty much given outset. It'll worse, covid used justification dramatic draconian past ""Look, covid even bad"" ""Remember said covid going make hospitals collapse"" ""Yeah well covid told going die immune system/vitamin c/god protected get even once, did, totally fine."" Conclusions:

We provide empirical evidence suggesting vaccination may reduce transmission showing vaccination health care workers associated decrease documented cases Covid-19 among members households. finding reassuring health care workers families. *N95 masks. surgical masks.

Edit: thought different study. article compares surgical masks (pink/blue/yellow) cloth masks. 11% vs 5% protection‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt call 11% ‚Äúhighly effective,‚Äù thought study N95s‚Ä¶ idea is: one knows many people exposed covid. know many people test positive. Therefore makes sense calculate relative likelihood (vaccinated VS unvaccinated) instead absolute likelihood (we know true exposure numbers).

So end result something like: every 5 people test positive 4 unvaccinated 1 vaccinated. Assuming people exposure odds average means measuring efficacy vaccine. half effective, numbers study linked surgical masks 11% drop risk, compared 5% drop cloth. finding reinforced laboratory experiments whose results summarized preprint. data show even 10 washes, surgical masks filter 76% small particles capable airborne transmission SARS-CoV-2, says Mushfiq Mobarak, economist Yale University New Haven, Connecticut, co-author study. contrast, team found 3-layered cloth masks filtration efficiency 37% washing use. Lol die results we've seen vaccination greatly reduces rate catch Delta variant (even reduced rate versus original strains) also reduces number days fully contagious (you hit levels virus uninfected person, drops much faster unvaccinated person).

Between two, relatively low cost measures society, we'd done. close 85% vaccine compliancy we'd good.  Well yeah, mature adults home can't spread covid. Fuck fearne, fucking piece shit, hope dies covid himself.
I‚Äôm paying thousands rent piece shit country can‚Äôt even come back negative cpr test.

Either way still constructive dismissal would need prove action based solely religion. not, action based safety employee customer. Yes. Although situation seems bad now, especially compared could‚Äôve weren‚Äôt Delta, really better position year ago beat back virus 12 vaccines coming month

However, I‚Äôm sure heard they‚Äôre coming month. Everything I‚Äôve heard far says it‚Äôll probably end year vaccine 12s available. I‚Äôd love come sooner though. Granted, looks like Pfizer submitting data FDA month, timeline clear. It‚Äôs admitting it‚Äôs virtually statistically impossible see potential one ten million side effect testing population 40,000 (the vaccine trial sizes)

That doesn‚Äôt justify legal protection.
If vaccines safe cost low.

If vaccines unsafe cost would high.

If vaccines manufacturer refused go ahead without legal protection, gigantic red flag..

The legal system keep every participant honest. Yes, unmarried sister travel nurse soon. easy option married kids life one city.  It‚Äôs hard trace someone infected. One big Autumn wave probably 90+% immunity. cost thousands lives overstretched hospitals. Pandemics end, one way another. Then, need manage endemicity. Adults terrible  couldn‚Äôt get link work, anyone else? didn‚Äôt downvote you, guess ton uncertainty covid forecasting, including many experts badly wrong forecasts (they tend biased toward downside, ie negative), New Jersey doesn‚Äôt seem like great candidate near term spike given fairly good vaccination rates, added natural immunity last two months, good weather fall keep people outdoors. illegal grounds forced termination allows employee get unemployment. Doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs works. go best option yourself, people. doubt it. show help Egyptian slaves, American slaves, native Americans, people bubonic plague, dinosaurs. 

If get lucky we'll figure open portal another dimension toss trash clean planet. haven‚Äôt known anyone experienced vaccine side effects two weeks. Well, yes, we're seeing whole lot people hear *first instinctive response* (for good reason): cAn'T tElL dO!!

So. Problem white house also paying unvaccinated people stay home. sister inlaw strongly vaccine. Quit job (A hospital requires vaccines) collects 3 children gigantic tax return. found way work $12,000 tax return $750 month kids.  Vaccines masks would greatly suppress pandemic, convinced would enough crush pandemic entirely. would probably need lockdowns well.

Interestingly, China able get excellent hold pandemic early even without vaccine. used aggressive on-the-spot lockdowns, rigorous monitoring, mass testing masks. sure... could sunny days without global warming... would ask pirate... mocked him, say ""my grandmother died someone wearing mask"" kind ridiculous. hell know that? need move narrative. hand wringing point. part continue part. point enough, pandemic persist even 70% people part. 

Additionally happened likely happen others. got COVID despite double vaccination. first tested negative. spread bunch people - vaccinated. time tested positive quarantined late infected people knew probably many others know - symptoms tested negative.  vaccines work mild symptoms symptoms, ability vaccinated spread disease, we're beyond slogan ""if everyone would get vaccinated"". 


The real solution worldwide complete total lockdown 1 month. Well Jersey pretty much everyone treats things like back normal anyway cause many us vaccinated. Sure gotta wear mask sometime whatever least go club That's right. Israel started strong halted, likely lot heavily religious people elect take vaccine. stopped around 60%. millions getting third shot, many new people getting first shot? Arguably important no-dose people become double-dosed. allowing kids take it. Yep, Pfizer lot schools opened. varies region. Like South school open 6 weeks. friend northeast whose child attending school 2 weeks tomorrow. Keeping kids school stopped spread which, turn, helped stopped development variants. But, many people aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet (including children), virus allowed spread variants gaining traction. Delta variant developed stronger, spreadable, deadlier variant. are‚Ä¶. happened mentioned GP think could link vaccine laughed ignored it! happened way back April. Last heard, 10 percent co workers got vaccinated. needs mandate coming big retail companies requiring vaccination employees vendors. Thousands people come here, I'm sure spread store. air stagnant crowded.  four times less likely? seems weird math. baby tell can‚Äôt see vaccinated. Worked mom nephew. 

That one thing see work multiple friends kids last year. Otherwise pretty dug point.  financial interest so. Wow, Visa card! Winter 2021 like Winter 2020. Delta going peak soon start falling. Cases burning population eventually run out. 12 vaccines coming month, boosters end month. It‚Äôs going get point unvaccinated won‚Äôt ability damage now. may variant upcoming years, lot going us year ago. Despite catches GOP local governments, better place eventually.

Sad exemplary adults room.  risk infection single game low relative benefit person getting vaccinated, greatly reduces risk.

Its good idea. work federal agency ask attest. level regulations executive branch actually enact?

Isn't power create policies hands states? utterly disgraceful! works cases don‚Äôt go substantially high. hospitals full, comfort know fraction cases ending hospital improved. absolute number matters. Likewise, absolute number dead matters. 

Vaccines great! every absolute metric worse. numbers quote like people focus carbon intensity, cheering emissions per GDP go total emissions go up. 

See winter does. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. cases don‚Äôt spike higher relative rate translate lower absolute rate too. 

But year year absolute stats worse, bad summer. Archive? That's here. except course hospital staff. overwhelmed. ... need work people. I'm sorry. Delta observed shorter incubation period previous variants? bizarre statement. large chunk medical doctors scientist working vaccine various religions? mean weirdo use religion reason get vaccinated.  Tbf, fits perfectly antivaxxer behavior. They're grown children throwing tantrum. Even though still catch Covid double vaccinated?

Like myself, caught Covid months double vaccinated. understand logic.

This thing really understand. Anyone pushing ""greener"" anything pushing *hard* WFH reason. add commute to?

I'd go far say company *could* employees work home ""green"" company all.  That's simply true. included clinical trials research relate Ivermectin treating COVID-19.. first source clinical trial Dexamethasone. 2nd source looks Zika virus. 3rd source looks study treating Ascaris, intestinal parasite. believe scroll bottom ""meta analysis"" click links.

No isn‚Äôt. 80% questions press conferences leading trying evoke good sound bite response. often clear bias one political party too, either softballs ridiculously base questions.  'Knox said reflection Rutherford County.' 


Yes, is. considered expatriation, apparently hate moving hate COVID. Last year, pre-vaccine, Idaho doctors Kootenai County begged elected officials put mask mandate place.

They didn't, got insane quotes:

Personal reasons. guess one way admit dick actually akin fired. clear cut constructive dismissal. Tons employees going file unemployment. states passed laws explicitly saying can't get unemployment refusing vaccine. know go states tho  Statistics generally required graduating high school So? info kids 6months 5 years able get vaccinated? Well first 2 groups randomly selected. bunch unvaccinated 10 year olds bunch vaccinated 80 year olds expected risk hospitalization begin with. perfectly possible 80 year old 10x greater chance hospitalization begin 90% effective vaccine reduced chance 10 year olds. safe, Israel giving old people booster get back 90% short term protection shown comparing vaccinated 80 year olds unvaccinated 80 year olds. thought weird too, pharmacist silly told don‚Äôt like needles.

Well kids adults children own. We‚Äôre reaping sow country it‚Äôs going continue get worse. Right. analyzing total numbers probably undersells vaccine's effectiveness, since vaccinated people likely older (and thus susceptible virus, ceteris paribus) shorter supply, find buy home test kits can. anyone home exhibiting symptoms, test without going out. accurate form testing infinitely better nothing.  Yea alternatively ‚Äúif people weren‚Äôt selfish assholes everything would better‚Äù People call Christians quite far actual Christians. I‚Äôm pretty sure means 10 people would gotten infected 9 would. seems makes case mask wearing worthwhile it‚Äôs enough needs part layered mitigation strategy.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong tend think COVID spread kind like compound interest. One extra case week turns 3 extra cases next week, turns 10 extra cases week than, on.   one, 500,000 Americans aren‚Äôt dead. think know incredibly ignorant. nice day. Sorry boy lost :( Self care something happens end. 9/11 responders dug rubble buckets put tiny pieces human bodies that's could find, single survivor, took breaks get massages massage tents, talked people tents talking, said felt better people. okay perform self care middle horror. survival technique helps recoup get back fight.  I‚Äôm thought. Predictable ‚ÄúOutbreak‚Äù type movies, think political mess wasn‚Äôt predictable. honestly never thought getting shot would political game many. 

I‚Äôm done worrying others, can, realize others make decisions. worried vaccine-triggered myocarditis, recommending avoid strenuous exercise one week 2nd shot. Pfffft. Granted Canadian dollars spent month US hospital (3 weeks ICU) following accident. final bill came $250k. Insurance Medicare paid everything except $1,000. think bad schools open, wait kids mingling together hours poorly ventilated buildings buses every week day. jehovas witnesses decent sized religion think offhand, apparently rescinded ban vaccination 50 years ago.

there few, religions actually ban vaccination, since religions much older practice vaccination. would require new scripture and/or prophets, explicitly forbid. bans modern practices usually involves pretty extreme interpretation vaguely related scripture. Yeah. people get medicine science, learning, progressing actually wanting help people. Various reasons exist well. Girls neck woods money. power usually abuse comes that. sorts reasons. met really cool smart doctors side spectrum. fucked.  interesting question line - businesses choose serve? Last time checked, OK ban blacks visiting store US - something universally accepted even looked 100 years (it's 4 generations). 


Even funnier, unvaccinated person half year ago able thing nowadays unvaccinated can. vaccinated person always carry ID show left right - something month ago. no, still mask places vaccinated people allowed into. overall we're worse social situation now. Australia pretty far behind vaccinations. think fully vaccinated around 30-40% population Yep. Big tech companies like Google already deactivated employee badges building access shown proof vaccination. Canada, bill. get discharged that's end it. Employce mustwashhands  Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. said another post, saw coming thousand miles away. soon UK‚Äôs cases started going June despite higher vaccination rate, knew trouble; matter time.

Then protesting front schools. Let kids go school without losers harassing them, much ask? agree. Anyone still quarantining post-vax point delusional. course saying get downvoted moral grandstand effort though Jesus take bills I'm sure shit going room packed vaxxholes. different? lot America's problems could solved Americans like Americans. 0 years. happening now. US federal gov't requiring vaccines (announcing later today). L.A. county voting kids required get (12+) - likely pass. think talking inverse multiplication. N times less likely equal multiplying 1/N. get true measure effectiveness go age brackets. first seeing accounts effectiveness serious disease dropping 60%- data wasn‚Äôt accounting age disparity. adjusted age- vaccine showed incredibly effective severe COVID.  2 weeks post 2nd shot standard. Insurance companies increase premiums unvaccinated stop covering hospitalization unvaxxed case covid. Employers charge every month fire completely. nothing reason them, make life miserable, one holding us back pandemic. Unvaxers complain freedom taken away them, taking freedom actually. real solution worldwide complete total lockdown 1 month.

Which would much cheaper life-saving ended with. experience catholic US, alot Catholics (laypeople priests) like current pope. consider liberal often disregard says openly argue wrong several topics. southeast dealing while, waves outbreaks. Highly vaccinated places normalcy fine. Me: Sorry, religion prohibits using indoor bathrooms. need accommodation shut woods. 

HR: Best ficus handicap stall. ""Let kids smile""? start masks stop smiling. Secondly, send kids school visually pleasing?  mom said ""blessed"" work granted religious exemption vaccine. asked Southern Baptism say vaccines forbidden? got annoyed. many years vaccines mandatory school/work etc? people sick seems wrong, heathcare professional. shots done way every injection, one poke. This. Kids could always ‚Äúget‚Äù covid. What‚Äôs observed function delta‚Äôs much higher transmission rate. Way transmission, way cases, way (still very, relatively rare) illness/severe illness. Agreed. wouldn‚Äôt go saying feel better death happening. That‚Äôs like saying great mood sifting rubble. even peak yet. Projected deaths going up. down. hospital spends, bill is, tbf.

Still, get vaccinated. 11% drop risk good finding? Isnt value kinda small? mean, Andrew Wakefield published falsified study back 1998 really kicked things off, there's always *some* opposition vaccines. people suffering mean can't appreciate situation thing Chile also, yeah, another stranger internet saying there's hope summer hope relied majority Americans getting vaccinated. guess hindsight known antimask people going antivax certain extent. think would majority though. 

But I'm going first concert nearly two years next week. They're requiring proof vaccine door. I'm totally fine with. vaccine gives freedom semi-normal.  It‚Äôs worrisome unvaccinated families.  Delta already peaked states. NJ we've acted like corona totally we're already flatlining That's true all. contact trace figure place someone infected. can't say certainty that's actually contracted though. could get asymptomatic passerby street. 

Even could say sure got specific place, can't say certain because/from someone wearing mask. agree, that's prefaced saying: ""to degree becomes feasible"". However, underestimate tracing isolation tactics, definitely worked several countries. Even CDC still common sense practice, question is, government become part solution problem?

I think mandates solution, although going go way willing sacrifice population sake (those would die covid) certainly China Australia attempted working towards way go: absolute lockdown letting people starve death houses die covid trapped.  Da Bi-Bull expressly requires quarantining face-coverings. It‚Äôs clearly spelled Exodus.  probably biggest ""why can't nice things"" I've seen lifetime. Delta hit rural Arkansas, I‚Äôm willing bet made way crowded part country. 

The northeast good vaccine rates LOTS natural immunity. natural immunity amongst communities vaccine hesitant, wouldn‚Äôt surprise 90%+ adults immune point, least NYC.     mean, much felt late last spring, made biggest u-turn I‚Äôve ever seen fucking life. There‚Äôs mask mandates school two jobs now, campus events rapidly moved online. Things may get better see reason believe won‚Äôt rapidly return it‚Äôs been. 

I realize everyone it, I‚Äôm it, doesn‚Äôt stop restrictions reinstated. lack education translates guaranteed vote gop future. Gotta preserve future party y‚Äôknow? 4x less likely means every 4 unvaccinated people contract COVID 1 vaccinated person will. Phrasing differently, saying vaccinated one quarter likely infected unvaccinated, awkward harder understand don‚Äôt understand argument. People vaccine still spread disease. (I‚Äôve vaxed)

The Pfizer six month study showed vax unvaxed similar viral loads - either way could spread customers other. 

There much reduced risk hospitalization death vax‚Ä¶.. reduce insurance costs? someone religious exemption, wouldn‚Äôt think insurance costs would reason could fire them‚Ä¶ example religious group X costs much cover health plan‚Ä¶ fire them! 

I don‚Äôt think would work.

Again- get vaccinated doctor think it‚Äôs good idea!!!! helps keep alive. don‚Äôt understand justification mandates given science doesn‚Äôt support vaccines reduce viral load‚Ä¶.  They're trying get information ultra-rare, almost always mild side effect. Covid causes effect (and much serious ones) orders magnitude often.

Even American Academy Pediatrics opposed delaying approval 4-5 months conduct expanded trials that. cases extremely low serious cases kids extraordinarily rare, reasonable. delta kids now, kids heading back school, irresponsibility bordering malice. done APA suggested issue EUA based original cohort (which established new dosing perfectly acceptable safety levels), followed expanded cohort post market analysis.

It's going help antivaxxers either. care 1:50,000 1:200,000. They'll saying exact thing anyway. Nobody ever: ""Well I'm sure glad let little kids get hospitalized covid could make sure ultra-rare, mild side effect rare instead rare."" wonder results would schools students vote masks. *adult mocked children* fixed headline understand cruelty people sometimes especially woman, nurse, practice compassion. Life become surreal. Like trust this. I'm pro vaxx. sick government lying us screwing things (re removing masks solely bc reward).  Aaaaand crossing yet another place list. bad way it. jealous know thing. 

I informed, repeatedly, Delta variant caused vaccines well vaccinated people responsible community spread vaccine shedding. Yes, people really believe ""facts""

People stupid. 'adults' even kids school, book it. Examples like made start following policy ‚Äútreat others treat others‚Äù terrible people. really never thought would reach point vaccines here, 90 year old grandmother - distanced family part, always masks, fully vaccinated - get wheeled hospital parking lot non Covid issue middle night hours end I‚Äôm gonna go ahead completely co-sign message. 

Seriously. middle fingers air. Fuck em. Okay, understand. FullFact article specifically talking UK AstraZeneca vaccine, higher risk profile younger people. (I bad American thing assumed America, vaccine used.) access one mRNA vaccines choose that, elevated risk apply you. UK, access, use AstraZeneca safer alternatives.

In US, we've used Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J. J&amp;J linked blood clots. Three deaths: article older, since appropriate treatment protocol distributed.

""Myocarditis reporting rates 40.6 cases per million second doses mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered males aged 12‚àí29 years."" school district information online tells us many cases school. update daily. I‚Äôm district 54,000 students. Less 1% tested positive since school started, less 1% positive one time. Numbers closer 500 students last week, week closer 400 currently positive. 

I.e. 15 cases sons school 3500, 16 daughter‚Äôs-1300 students. 

Maybe school districts online haven‚Äôt informed link. don‚Äôt recall informed, found it. ;-) look infections per 100k population? Yep people live there?

A reasons--Wyoming ton public (Federal) land. Much state really harsh (but beautiful) topography conducive lots human development. Wyomingites biggest fear they'll turn Front Range Colorado lots openly hostile population growth. makes sense. believe medicine, would go hospital first place? seek help people hate institution believe fake? anti-vaxxers refuse answer questions? Everyone knew coming. People focused getting kids refused care health.

Covid virus causes Covid disease. two part thing. sure do. Yeah article totally off. Statewide hospitalizations levelled cases pretty flat. NYC particular, positivity rate decreasing 2.3% per state‚Äôs dashboard.  parent three school age kids honestly don‚Äôt get it. Wear mask help everyone. kids part don‚Äôt mind wearing mask. It‚Äôs crazy parents.  first line stanza truly fits around world stupid people breeding Physician Assistant Paramedic here: we're exhausted. said, giving hope, biggest problem we're facing pandemic misinformation. I've admitted 25-30 patients hospital bilateral COVID pneumonia hypoxic respiratory failure recent surge, every one individuals unvaccinated, almost unvaccinated stuff false information received news social media. Every unvaccinated patient comes hospital severe COVID dug hole confirmation bias accrued data supports want believe, works well get ER come face face wearing CAPR respirator. 75% patients I've admitted regretted decision getting vaccinated.   parents school board meeting said ""Choice"" mean Mask.

It's like want teach kids think others.   Love energy, hate concept. cannot morality tests healthcare. already substandard care exorbitant prices based politics. Adding political tests harm us. Employers ask vaccine card. 50k base salary hard work. think misspelled ""arrogoant spiteful sociopaths"" now, neither wisdom. does, opposite traditionally assumed way.  country rules for? Running ground, catching COVID patients, dying.  God created universe hence vaccine? I've said it. I'm notorious infamous. watch latest viral clip anti-mask/anti-vaxxers school board meeting, taunting laughing teenage boy speaking grandmother dying Covid really think opinion ""too far"". 

At point game, people kind, caring vaccine-hesitant folks want make be.  laugh delight suffering others. 

We coddling great expense healthcare workers vulnerable children young vaccinated.  Continuing give people benefit doubt nothing less foolish. Less carrots, sticks. Florida? I'd like stay far away medical offices default now, imo.  days can‚Äôt even work energy respond anti-vax/mask dumb dumbs via anonymous Reddit account. willingness flood zone effective way.

That kid family majorly proud.   1. enough supply able donate vaccines give boosters. Logistically still practical thing do.
2. ""poor"" countries like Chile already administering booster shots, think that?
3. would benefit public health want boosters able get 6 months getting second shot. Less people getting symptoms means less spread. careful. Sound logic like could blocked lol surely another hard pill &amp; parents, retired pediatricians, swallow üíä teenagers need show up.

Lots them!

If got together maybe might help even odds bit. someone try insult saying ""You one kids paid attention school, huh?"" 

I literally know respond comment like that. really thought saying one looked bad. worst-behaved 1% us get attention. people everywhere; accept COVID real, want get past worst this. I‚Äôm posting vent don‚Äôt know right place this. Grandpap died COVID February. Two coworkers gotten it, one mid thirties ended hospitalized pneumonia (he recovered). unvaccinated. wife‚Äôs family members Republican called tell mom potentially exposed doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated ‚Äúvaccinated people shed virus‚Äù. heard husband, father law. claims heard news. 

Is really people saying news? vaccinated people ""shed"" virus onto others? completely fucking insane? know much handle. go another fucking funeral year might explode. I'm tired worrying loved ones falling ill, especially ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE. 

I know expect gain posting this. last time mentioned Grandpap Reddit somebody told living borrowed time anyway. I'm fucking tired, heart breaks wife who's going worried sick mom. literally told weeks ago point resigned fact mother probably die covid. really fucking miss 2019. Sure, way there's bill walking sidewalk. live rural area means, I've city council meetings city, lot people remarkably dense. people going meetings often people be. Yep seems like lot careful might wrong, least one city find, [it looks like new cases among younger who're [less (&lt;87%) likely theory's right, would mean UK whole herd immunity, subpopulation younger people who're likely associate thus spread among other.

Really hope gets fired South Park isn‚Äôt parody telling me? Seems like covid stay we'd best figuring treat better. countries saying anyway is. NYC time series sequenced variants Delta 97% cases.  problem school get less money absences, affect ability meet budget bills. 

Schools get paid students attend. schools aggressive missing many kids go school sick one thing another spread whatever germs have, causing absences. 

It‚Äôs vicious cycle, think lessons Covid, schools need something place students miss still school home keep germs away without anyone penalized, schools still get money. It‚Äôs federal state political issue funds. 

I.e. - record classes like college watch one able complete work. 

This would work middle school high school, maybe older elementary grades, would forgiveness youngest ones. don‚Äôt know answer, something better current system encourages kids go school sick. Sorry one thing clear whole thing, look competent info. Maybe done jobs first place saved us nightmare? wait undetermined amount time certain percentage Ethiopians (sorry using example) get vaccinated put health jeopardy meanwhile? Get lost. Seriously? think opinion (and stupidly laughing child‚Äôs story loss) enough lose job? would like someone said opinion (no matter asinine) grounds lose livelihood, turn causes lose home (due non-payment mortgage since you‚Äôre unemployed) causes children go hungry since isn‚Äôt money food? 

I personally feel POV idiotic top that, laughing child‚Äôs story pain loss reprehensible, don‚Äôt think lose job. Gal Gadot   Yup.

Hopefully go way coronaviruses become equivalent common cold. 100% required make social media post admit wrong friends / family wake hell get vaccinated. Idaho rationing care, sickest (i.e., unvaccinated) could denied ICUs.  Sounds like fired lol  Delta already peaked NYC, terms case growth hospital admissions. Looks like pulled incivility.

Maybe learn communicate civilly.  Thanks, comment replying removed now. Cheers know say one full crap

Praise Lord true! don‚Äôt need idiots procreating Indeed -- 1 5000 per day amounts 7% year, consistent 5% present.

The ability vaccine reduce hospitalization chances tied effective preventing infection/transmission, seems waned various reasons (waning immunity, Delta, etc.). **Once testing positive** vaxxed person 3.2% chance going hospital, versus 7.6% chance unvaxxed, according Aug 24 report CDC [see ]. rest efficacy see quotes like 75% 99% coming benefits vaccine, like reduced infections/etc. numbers also fluctuate around local case counts, example.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  think chance pushes isolation tracking governmental level. Even NSW Australia basically given around 1,000 cases day. practical fast Covid spreads, even Delta. Heard something early Oct 18th think sure US could've enjoying normalcy long time everyone done part. give us update vaccine kids. keep giving different dates different opinions nobody FDA, CDC, etc. seem focused that. want least hear, ""we met Pfizer Moderna gave us exact dates they'll wrap current round clinical trials."" nonsense of, ""Well, maybe we'll vaccines kids 12 maybe winter..."" sufficient. Pfizer least approved back July instead FDA dragging heels telling Pfizer conduct new clinical trials. apology necessary, I'm scientist (I make AAV) can't keep data straight.  People estimating practical impact mask mandates based implemented US. Washington DC, liberal, masks required indoor settings. However, required bars/dance clubs drinking eating drinking restaurants. go inclusive section Washington Nationals games even staff always wear masks. gym, trainer showed get mask filters remove filters make easier breath working (which apparently still meets legal definition mask). 

It's masks impact, however, impact tiny compared vaccination. people high risk, taught wear high quality masks fitted properly (will interesting see mentioned today Biden's release). Yes. Vaccines small stuff. religions forbid walking hospitals. Incidentally, also support child marriages. Girls young 14 die pregnancy complications allowed go hospitals. every metric worse. left fairly crucial metric determining progress pandemic.

Last summer's outcome cases: \~4.5% deaths 
This summer's outcome cases: \~0.85% deaths (and dropping)

The vaccines work. nurses work (I'm LMSW) spent. I'm maybe half I'm toast. 

Props people sign military. know years. Anti vaxxers racists coming together, going fun teaching sort marginal job start with. much pay, lots headaches. add risk death maskless crazies, teacher issue spread 50 states soon. Family culture different outside US Western Europe. People successfully convinced anti-vax loved one get jab, it? refused see mom gets shows signs budging.  several, linked CDC post study agreeing statement, however study Israel says infection better Delta resistance. I'd spend time I'm willing get better answer. fair point. clear implication there. suppose could focused say anti-vaxxers know consider ""reasonably healthy somewhat in-shape"" much not. clarify, vaccinations fall description ""healthcare received"" protected HIPAA. Dr. Scarlet go around telling people Colonel Mustard vaccinated covid late tetanus booster post internet list unvaccinated patients. 

What people usually fail understand HIPAA apply people medical providers, people allowed ask proof vaccination waiver allowing access certain medical information employment, education, access public areas. I‚Äôm sure serious not, COVID hasn‚Äôt created policing shortage. wish officers would responsible get vaccinated, let‚Äôs overstate details sake making point. COVID killed lots cops.  (in 2 diff school systems). feels like settling herd immunity point. really states publish individual breakthrough data decide then, guess. Delta seems ripping city NY.

Right city, cases less half last peak, deaths low‚Ä¶ less 20 per day (as opposed hundreds per day last peak).

While we‚Äôre perfect, downstate NY pretty good example vaccines masks work people what‚Äôs right.

FYI: nervous school starting, cold weather coming. first reaction Comment ‚ÄúGTFO.‚Äù comment designed outrage, it‚Äôs anecdote used example religious people, specifically group evangelical Christians laws in, United States come conclusion Covid vaccine religion. included part Tylenol illustrate slightly hypocritical position. 


Instead, think I‚Äôm going try explain much like met in-laws you‚Äôre probably ignorant. United States I‚Äôm guessing countries probably work way, definitely United States it‚Äôs like religion point view handed one person. Christians, specifically evangelical Christians go church Sunday listen sermon, go Bible studies throughout week. Bible studies led by, sometimes pastors, often fellow churchgoers. talk Bible current events try decide worldview based interpretations certain Bible verses think applicable. bunch people sitting around decide use board fetus cells despite fact don‚Äôt really understand worked, religion they‚Äôre abortion, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs decided vaccine religion.


Are wrong? Objectively yes. understanding works. zero understanding science, willfully ignorant it‚Äôs working. try explain shut get angry tell something along lines ‚Äúwe‚Äôre what‚Äôs right eyes God‚Äú.

In conclusion, mostly don‚Äôt really know I‚Äôm going us, GTF oh‚Ä¶ Sorry study question published credible journal, hosted accredited, reputable institution. decade since study‚Äôs supposed 2011 publication, little ‚Äî ‚Äî related research confirm findings. Furthermore, spokesperson U.S. Food Drug Administration told Snopes infertility men known side effect ivermectin and, such, included U.S. labeling requirements.

Come on, people. better pedalling ivermectin Covid quoting dubious study? Y'all really care evidence-based medicine want people side political divide? Prayer warriors unite!! ""basic flu"" different thing every year, Covid strain thus far slight variations thing. Even ""worse"" Delta variant exact virus last year spike proteins it, booster shots ""more vaccine"" adjust all.

Tuberculosis used kill millions, too. eventually got shit handled large extent. countries diligent data breakthrough cases. USA one them.

That mean need speculate it. Breakthrough cases uncommon. Breakthrough hospitalizations amongst elderly rare. Vaccines still useful, silver bullet. old vaccinated, might risks now, low vaccinated low compliance areas, simply one else mitigating environment.

Go look variants concern reports UK. there. irony.  Watching shitshow safety Australia, cannot wrap head around last 7 years happening US. 2 years election cycle, 4 years Trump overlap 2 years covid. Hugely negatively impacting non-life sustaining treatments well. dying, seen, cases. I'm thinking could number things, since work vulnerable population (kids profoundly disabled teenager) need rule out. 

Damn. need. I'm traveling well over. Good call! hope -- implication vaxxed, infected, untested people likely pretty mild symptoms...unless think cold/allergies misunderstand vaccine efficacy Delta. Still, also mild symptoms.

Hopefully schools orgs require weekly/bi-weekly student/employee testing might able give us nice data future. I'm really trying downplay COVID, said practice seeing COVID related hospitalizations.  RSV hand....  

Either way bad part system really designed handle both.  Atlanta Children's Healthcare Atlanta crazy wait times right now. age 99.9% information spread like 5 companies, none real incentive prioritize legitimate information views potential advertisement.

We're going libraries find select information, little slot machines attention pockets.   California, CDPH database quickly pull vaccination information. unfortunately know well you‚Äôre describing Let's apply logic then:

So individual get influenza vaccine every year, individual hospitalized influenza, would say doctors deny treatment? person responded didn‚Äôt say this. comment gaining access ICU resources didn‚Äôt get vaccine. 

Obviously things become different actually ICU beds, understaffed, need begin ration care. However, simply choosing vaccine would maybe part decision making process, would small rare. car accident victim unvaccinated guy contending spot ICU, car accident guy 10% chance making it, unvaccinated guy estimated 50-75% chance, they‚Äôll get treatment. 

Now sure, vaxxed person unvaxxed person contending spot, vaxxed person get it, that‚Äôs also higher odds beating it. need specify write opinion? sorry clear you.. 

again, believe becomes ethical issue already refused care related medical issue Wait sec, flu causes Alzheimer's? No. doctor made decision based availability resources likelihood survival. Can't pull ventilator additional staff thin air. Triage. least he‚Äôs stopping spread likely never left keyboard 5 years  things free even democracy. free kill harm others, free drive street without license, free cocaine. We've come together society determine things harm people around you. getting vaccine different? People okay laws preventing stuff want fight back getting vaccine could prevent loved ones even people vicinity contracting COVID.   Yes, know age plays huge role COVID risk. That's objected to. objected specific claim ""Towards Data Science"" article things equal, younger ages, see 100-fold differences risk depending presence absence preexisting conditions.

The cdc link posted all. He‚Äôs outspoken ‚Äúthe crazies‚Äù since March 2020. point entire hours show dedicated ranting anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers. 

Im actually surprised story picked feels like old news anyone listens regularly. Nice!      blue cross insurance membership offered 50 proof vaccination. Happily taking money prove something already lol Hawkeye (Pierce young'uns) deny treatment enemy soldiers.  answered ""comparison"" question, I? people declined vaccine be. Poor country European standards, still rich worldwide scale. wish they'd written ""kilominutes""

American ER system breaking already covid. ER cant refuse treatment based ability pay heavily used people non emergency care didnt think could get anywhere else 

Our entire healthcare system needs overhaul. total mess.  Precisely. going deny someone care could provided scruples finish job cut throats. Denial medical service form internationally recognized torture, idea people calling done countrymen monstrous. Medical care gold star making good decisions, otherwise we'd dumping drunk drivers dumpsters hundreds. true! No, no, nothing like people experience Canada!The longest I've waited doctor's appointment (family doctor) 2 weeks. longest I've waiting ER less 15 minutes seen.

There's lot misinformation there. :( system country wide *perfect* I'd take US system day! temperature somewhere 99.0 99.7 (stupid thermometer). I'm going rapid test tomorrow. navy civilian, heard anything office. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è know ROM waivers fully vaccinated traveling though. Sort same. got mine pharmacy. still took personal details form sent registration. 

I heard people vaccinations handled bit less attention detail, never happened. fuck going mind assholes? patients beds patients due medical problems fault? Yes. situation we're right now, post scarcity fantasy. Literal sticks full Taliban. put signs either side bollard large heavy object like landscaping boulder. Come hit this, dumdums. ( hydrant, though)  Read article understand what's happening: figured would norm eventually. Interesting see coming fast. DeSantis noticed crowd response Brooks Trump - going back ‚Äòthat‚Äô base Yes almost certain every hospital procedure implement it.  means going 20% week whole week dropped 20%? Vaccinated people breakthrough COVID infections typically become less sick unvaccinated.

Stop thing moment: immune system trained deal COVID, body better prepared fight would otherwise. pans along similarly ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù coronavirus vaccine

It certainly seems within realm possibility.

[SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies maximize breadth resistance Shit, doesn‚Äôt change minds experiencing actual death.  That's ethically vacuous slippery slope on. What's stop caregivers rationing care ""self-inflicted"" reasons then?

Best bet triage last end line. headline could written 16 months ago. Apparently learned anything people still willing make minor sacrifices comments fascinating. idea issue. I'm intrigued see research shows!  I'm using method calculate number (6.0 times // 9.2 times) original data does. translate 600%/920% 

This comment explains someone knows ""vaccine efficiency"" calculated based numbers (ie. ""vaccine 95% effective X"") would love know! No, that's anyone saying.  


But things equal, two people get COVID - one vaccinated one not, data shows chances monumentally higher unvaccinated one much harder go vaccinated person. Data also show vaccinated people general much less severe course takes less time resources. 

Are outliers? Sure. build policy around outliers. one staffed bed remaining two people otherwise similar health coming equally sick COVID one vaccinated not, data overall pretty clear two people get it.   25%? propaganda keeping uneducated getting vaccine accomplishes how? people country think tell women fault got pregnant thereby deny care, think could extend ""logic"" welcomed covid bodies open arms. really. bigger picture, athlete entertains bring $ mean yeah sure educated folk like doctors,teachers scientific type kinda boring. needs entertainment types keep us know....Entertained  Weird, seen anything like UK.  HARD AGREE really, already applied Hippocratic Oath vaccine, patient denied use.  Yup ER trip 6 month old 2 weeks ago pediatrician told us getting insane levels RSV ER doctors said same. ER doctor also said worst part RSV really comfort care doctor sucks there‚Äôs much ‚Äúfix‚Äù Another anecdote! Pregnant 4 months second dose :) Maybe, lot us get vaccines primary care clinic. went vaccination fair. Anti-Vaxxers seek care certified Prayer Warriors give ok let fans stay home don‚Äôt want comply?

Because venues planning use barred state law checking customer‚Äôs vaccination status. isn‚Äôt slippery slope argument, it‚Äôs comparison. Also, slippery slope argument isn‚Äôt always fallacious. 

If x, z? deny didn‚Äôt get vaccine, don‚Äôt deny others behaved recklessly. 

If can‚Äôt contend question, that‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt start spouting fallacy obviously don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre talking about. Wrong choice words original post believe testing early assuming you‚Äôre negative contributing spread. Obviously anti-vaxxers anti-maskers hold responsibility. prevents becoming infected approximately 9,999 times 10,000.

It not. Efficacy infection 80-95% range, risk reduction 44.7% cases vaccinated

5.08% cases coming 44.7% vaccinated implies (94.92 / 55.3) / (5.08 / 44.7) = 15x risk ratio. think point no, deny care anyone needs treatment, things ""normal."" But, dealing overcrowded hospitals, limited staffing supplies, yes one point going deny care someone. someone person responsible thing begin with.  Kick antivaxxers beds too. damn consequences. Yes, did. meaning caused false sense security USA removed mandates. un-vaxed spreading it. Howard Stern psychopath anyone attitude needs evaluate themselves. Let‚Äôs get better instead giving problem information overload. access real info. also access bullshit. there's way sift it. time, energy, resources, intelligence personally go it.

So people find others trust trust blindly info there. 

That's there's legit people minding biz turn anti-vaxxers  triage.

Saying vaccinated people receive priority different saying unvaccinated cannot receive medical care all. local paper article bad RSV children right local clinics hispitals. straining system COVID. usually see much RSV November started circulating July year. know. Also takes account resources needed survive. I‚Äôm RN disaster triaged before. literally take people alive could normally survive takes many resources. one hundred people injured surgeon doesn‚Äôt time 6 hour surgery amputate. people die die. It‚Äôs depressing do, feel like grim reaper. seeing drop. mask wearers would spreaders wearing mask. agree apples apples ""no masks vs properly worn masks."" masks vs less masks. Everytime good uptick mask use mandates, see reduction spread. consistent correlation despite naysayers (or 'ivermectin' dosing NEIGH-sayers) would us believe. 

It always reducing spread point emission; filtering, great powered air-purifying respirator options cost less monocolonial antibody treatment, systems best left first responders medical professionals high risk environments. Um, way different standard care Canada.

I see doctor day. go one numerous, free, walk-in clinics. see family doctor need appointment, go walk-in something like strep throat, ear infection, funny mole.

Hell, family doctor, call ahead delay lunch see day emergency. swear doesn‚Äôt least change restrictions, contact tracing quarantining, masking kids, don‚Äôt know do. SOCO messaging Anti vaxxers incredibly stupid want everyone else suffer

It‚Äôs bad enough wasting hospital resources, try attack hospital workers. 

This can‚Äôt nice things God love books.  addition, can't find something better time? UK voted expanding eligibilty vaccinating kids, either AZ also care children, value human life machine profit dominance?

Brazil also rejected use Sinovac kids (this one Chile vaccinating children Brazil care children, value human life machine profit dominance?

It's pretty easy talk shit without informed reddit dude. Yawn.. Terrorists agree authorized, voluntary, believe that's happen countries going next year current booster trial studies wrap up.

Point is; general population, may difference clinical outcomes, is, amount new infections cause hospitalization, turn deaths, either case. breakthrough infection deaths almost exclusively among elderly otherwise compromised, best prognosis length time. we'll likely continue see numbers, 3rd shot not, long delta variant circulating freely vaccination rates still low curb spread.

Polio really good comparison; polio virus eradicated 30 years developed world. vaccinate children precaution, polio vaccine something like 99% lifetime effective one shot. polio live spreading covid rates, vaccine waning efficacy time see different picture. Damn. Just.... jeez. ""just flu"" narrative referring type symptoms.  

This talking point pushed heavily early days pandemic (Bakersfield docs, Barrington docs, etc) Covid similar health impact flu taking precautionary measures bad flu season.

This turned completely utterly wrong. video attacker since bank lobby? victim/manager able point out. problem fill hospitals, everyone's. They're downvoted lot people Reddit think downvote express unhappiness dissatisfaction thought somebody has, matter factual truthful is. Lock prison go maskless much likes.

He also wonderful time, enjoys violent degenerate racist 1 guy, imagine poc try prison. 

He'll blast right shanks pierce putrid flesh... interesting study, rather irrelevant somebody already caught recovered virus? choice first vaccination vs first infection, like go back time avoid getting infected. abortions contagious. Kids always like that, extremely adaptable much intelligent people give credit for.  Yes time son tested positive pediatrician said coming back 70/30 RSV covid week school starting stats might different now. However know 4 babies around sons age multi day hospital stays RSV since July. It‚Äôs hitting hard. Also 3 hospitals within 30 minutes one PICU rise making things extra hard pediatric patients vaccine? Chile vaccinating kids Sinovac, 5 votes favor 3 against.

UK voted expanding eligibility kids, comorbidities 12-15, AZ Pfizer. exact Sinovac trial results submitted Brazil voted expanding eligibility kids.

The media obviously never talk maybe reason need aggresive vaccinating children. Biden announce businesses 100+ employees must require vaccinations weekly testing. game changer. LinkedIn Facebook 2.0. amount likes anti-vaxxer spouting nonsense get absolutely insane. can't imagine many acquaintances people know life share beliefs, probably able look way knew. numbers article conditional probability. already done multiplication.

But didn‚Äôt normalize age, vaccine better article states. forget owns stock company makes one treatment drugs use people severe covid  Still carrot employees least.

""The rule would also require large companies provide paid time vaccination."" feel like testing giving money pharmaceutical industry getting vaccinated once. mention get sick much money moved big pharma.

If really want stick them, get vaccinated get sick first place.  interesting see plays out. test subset use statistical analysis determine there. Yes, sequencing confirm % every single case.

Do think every country world mass conspiracy pretending delta? Cause showing thing right now.  also gives businesses ""Hey to"" fault see bad government. Anyways vaccines good  Lucky people employer fires refuse get vaccinated, keep mind bill get hospitalized without insurance. 

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  35 million additional lawsuits   made own. blockade means gotta innovate DIY lot stuff. believe I'm saying this, anyone else think vaccinating kinda needs stop.

No, antivaxxers 

 half assing vaccines reason supposed new mutations popping pandemic never know got Delta? someone actually sequence strain?

Simple statistics, think anyone 100% certain likely got vaxxed months ago, idk I'm gonna go get booster id going available soon.

If America would likely get approved keep pushing people got vaxxed maybe booster going get tired carrying load everyone avoid injections well.

Nowadays, takes longer due influx patients checking in. article state those.  You‚Äôre thinking federal employee mandate. mandate *all* companies employ least 100 people. bible actually says wear mask social distance sick. 

Leviticus 13:45-56


Wish email included that. piece trash human being. Supreme Court already. TONS mandated vaccines already, federal workers children too. ruled constitutional. George Washington enacted vaccine mandate. yet Emergency Care minutes used instead hours, nowhere near precise enough. 

Fair wrong using metric used expert.

No, nothing ""wrong"", cbsnews medical journal. average reader ""the expert"" work emergency care. guess dubbed audience.

It's dumbing down. knowing audience translating information common language. talk emphasize importance minutes emergency care article still writing headline content way average reader easily understand. Excess deaths refer die mean deaths previous years. different crude death rate, deaths recorded year. time, sum crude death rates, instance 1990-2019 get mean many people die yearly, make predictions many people expected die given dynamics trends specific population study. exceptional circumstances (a global pandemic, instance) excess deaths rates come play, people die average previous years, counted atypical data average, thus excess. 

New Zealand exemplary early response pandemic citizens took path following guidelines taking care themselves. this, many deaths would attributed contagious diseases social behaviours (car accidents, injuries, murders, etc) actually happen less people died overall. Note drop excess deaths, crude death rates, course people still died. It‚Äôs already addressed [Supreme Supreme Court affirmed mandatory vaccinations perfectly constitutional. Yup, confirm. Engineering position interview last week Zoom got straight asked fully vaccinated could prove it. sure legally make effective state local level?

I fan this, though lot people going hate it. clearly best thing population country. looks like 64% adults currently vaccinated fully, policy applies 100 million people assume lead somewhere around 35 million additional people getting vaccinated. know Delta that's peaking? seeing numbers indicate strains popular ones? legit question. vaccines way effective expected be, expected people get them, didn't.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

However, tests always accurate delay get infected, get tested, get test results. Essentially, far less reliable vaccination prevent spread illness. guys actually worse conservatives.

lol Insurance companies don‚Äôt like pay anything. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs coming!  12 vaccines coming may variant upcoming years, lot going us year ago. Despite catches GOP local governments, better place eventually.

You speak optimism can't find yet...   insanity 

Right? mandated vaccines 3 months ago supply finally exceeded demand.  could saved 10s thousands lives way, gotten schools, hospitals, businesses economy fully back track.  

This got rid smallpox polio - government vaccine mandates. LFG minuscule don‚Äôt get myocarditus. getting enough attention? whole situation made realize fucking absurd we've basically allowed people frivolously decline modern medicine, still participate society, therefore prolong existence several diseases could've eradicated now. I'm favor health assurance part modern social contract.    know quarantine rules here, certainly work this. One clients almost died two years ago getting cold turned pneumonia.

I'm getting pretty sick - runny nose cough.   criticism think may over-estimated waning protection hospitalisation

This exactly takeaway. Upon basing that? shown waning immunity. indication waning continue, get worse. probably need 24 tweets show effectiveness vaccine starts decline precipitously 6 months we're trouble.

There theories effectiveness vaccine declines 6 months stabilizes, another theory [it actually seems like another case jumping conclusions. got second Moderna dose way back February, I've looking way get third hit fun (my 5G reception sooo good ever since first two shots). I'd rather wait two months try get booster demand high.

I'd wait longer coming soon sounds like [they yet started trials mRNA-1073, combo hope see next flu season earliest.

A lot flu seasons gone catch anything, would awesome never get more'n sniffle again. Supreme Court says vaccine mandates legal constitutional.     remote workers? wonder play Yeah looking worldometers India's 7 day average 6% past week, sure qualifies 'sharp surge' Delta plus 125 million unvaccinated Americans. Thousands minutes weirdest descriptor time ever heard. Yeah must know polio vaccine then. hope. combination Delta everyone open/relaxing mask requirements/generally pretending everything fine without actually achieving vaccination numbers need control spread. already   Insert chorus singing 'Hallelujah' That's beautiful. really bc delta variant. vaccines maybe effective thought.

my first response = Cool primary sources?

You supplied link confirmed saying disproves said.. admitted even read primary source.

Then said beleive primary sources, clear actually read primary sources.

I started arguing every comment thread? no... reading comment sections like reddit post replied crap posted replied inbox replies...

And no.. like source see reads it.. posted thinking proved point based abstract read proves know talking continue try squirm making many excuses along way making look even worse. Now, get insurance companies make unvaccinated people pay test‚Ä¶ makes sense. admit probably got little overconfident getting vaccinated quit wearing mask part.

It‚Äôs win-win-win. people asking legal, I'm reposting top level comment:

* first part creating policy federal workers must get vaccinated terminated. Since head executive branch, authority set guidelines like that.

* second part instructing contractor business federal government healthcare agency receives Medicare/Medicaid dollars make policy within companies. companies want continue business federal government, need comply policy.

* third part instructing OSHA implement policy requires employer 100 employees require vaccinations testing. penalty fine. policy may may constitutional, depending whether type regulation within scope Congress given agency. tried eat Capitol, makes difference would amazing.

Can see tantrums, though?? Hospitalizations &amp; death matter point cases. Countries like Iceland high vaccination seem okay. UK(Also high vax rate) even high case counts seeing nearly many deaths previous waves.  can't stand people.   Russia well million excess deaths covid  
Literally came read ahem ""controversial"" comments, disappointed lol. good decision. sure it'll hold - interesting approach use OSHA though. see protests happening lot push back companies required keep track employee vaccination status. agree slippery slope.

you claim anti-lockdown, yet subreddit quarantined.
curious.  think reasonable since anti vaxxers still choice get weekly tests instead. people crying ""overreach"" expect do? sit watch health care system collapse thanks anti vaxxers filling hospitals? can't build hospitals train health care workers fast enough. I'm wrong - means show single clinical trial showed Ivermectin effective treating COVID-19.  OSHA it.

And let‚Äôs get carried away. 3/4 American adults already vaccinated, number growing daily. 

Anti-vaxxers tiny minority people sick of.  get vaccinated mask indoors live life normal otherwise. Seriously know ton people age borderline suicidal stay home.  seen text reforms? Googling - found yet. boss already freaking lose people shut fully vaccinated, gross overreach.  fear: people allowed work home due Covid? still adhere testing home/mandatory vax? people continue inconvenience going getting test every week instead getting vaxxed? Vaccine mandates new legal. expansive rules mandate employers 100 workers require vaccinated test virus weekly

Ugh, pro-vaccine go, no. Let employers set vaccine policy. Effectively requiring people show ID proof medical procedure pretty much *all* work it. Damn, I'm kind grateful I've ever lived/worked oldish buildings bad thought economy recovering small businesses starting get back groove. place 5 employees 3 stomp feet quit effectively closes business. Small businesses size generally can't afford pay top dollar provide good benefits harder hire for. 100 employees 30 leave would suck minute, also line applicants door next day due generally higher wages better benefits/availability/flexibility. Um, kids can't get vaccinated. Babies still immature immune systems, work youngest kids.

Yea thing ""Schools underwhelmed spring tide autumn absences."" assonance makes pop say myself. Legally hard enforce. federal government can't enforce states localities. States theoretically enforce will, won't, many even try endless debates lawsuits ensue. School districts employers legally bit gray area may give people ""out"" offer weekly testing.

So patchwork. Today Biden announced Federal employees must get vaccinated without kind testing opt-out option. company, school district, etc. probably make decisions.  Historically shameful. good look future history books. Cruel ignorant. Cult-like bullying. accurate. BoE meetings district get real crazies public comment time comes up. Especially recently continuation mask mandates.   Source? Clinical trials typically include menstruating women studies. would introduce variables controlled. Like woman starts period trial, gets pregnant, would throw results. COVID vaccine trials different. either take menopausal women, women pill.

This leaves lot unanswered questions. Careful, falling high chair dangerous babies. Except FB  There's firm third country absolutely touch vaccine even mandated, find ways around including illegitimate religious exemptions, etc.

I really know point completely curtail individual rights extreme level.

In eyes, way cover bases full scale lockdown know they'll never economy.  suggest lump Christians (or *any* religion matter) together like that. 


I've met paranoid Athiest libertarian types want vaccine masks. saying, article said literally nothing religion brought it. Publicizing loud biggoted Christians reason makes news headlines low hanging fruit, quiet, careless people secular (not even necessarily anti-mask) literally dangerous pandemic. know self-proclaimed pagans wear masks outings. Oh GOP plan working perfectly. Keep pumping babies replace covidiots, keep said babies uneducated, turn mid aged fat dudes bounty hunters strip women rights. produces cash flow stimulates economy don‚Äôt see?! hate here.  Also deaths stayed super low, even cases rose like 10x   Isn‚Äôt unresponsive equal dead?  God fucking hate people respond like 8 year E4 barracks lawyer demands everyone thanks service. Bad troll bad. Talk insensitive pricks Predicting virus gone poorly beginning. think number contrarianism lot smaller actually. people resisting vaccinations mix populations - young people think invincible checked out, urban based under-represented populations skeptical vaccines lacking access, political libertarians reflectively resist anything perceived government over-reach probably subsets people thought about. tempting lump everyone together complex problem never solved lumping everyone un-caring rebels.  good authority another Reddit user since 515 deaths children 5 million cases COVID still ‚Äúemergency‚Äù children. Therefore children shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated EUA‚Ä¶. 

I guess record hospitalizations, higher numbers Urgent Care/ED/pediatrician visits don‚Äôt count either.

Nothing see here‚Ä¶. Move along. 

/s Must nice. Capitalism Land ankle surgery, typical Post Surgery care, etc.. Total surgery cost around $50,000. didn‚Äôt obviously pay that, Co-Pay thankfully nothing more. I‚Äôm curious know much passion behind anti-vaccine people Christian faith US. article someone else posted helpful one explanation.  Beliefs funny thing ignorant leaders manipulate science based evidence attack faith itself. Faith science coexist fine many people. School board meetings general insane. wifes old school, meeting, multiple moms go *demand* school shut block parties within 5 blocks school, want kids exposed people drink play loud music (usually latino/caribbean music) them. Nevermind school cannot shut block parties, also block parties mostly pretty tame. sounded life death issue, would accept answer, shut down, kids would become drug dealers prostitutes. 

That really scratches surface terms shit used go school board meetings there.  would vaccines cause infection?   normal circumstances, sure. Normally, enough ICU beds enough hospital staff accommodate everybody. Normally hospitals cancelling every single elective surgery order dedicate resources treating emergency patients. 

Normally doctors judge person providing medical care. Normally parking garages repurposed sick wards. Well vaccine efficacy lowering chance severe illness hospitalization proven opinion. That's probably conclusion reached, least decidedly convinced right thing individuals. ... hence, got vaccinated. 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
There huge misunderstanding many people spending time interrogating though. whole ""can't go concert (or go flight) vaccinated"" makes limited sense given information available people. media spends absolutely zero time effort distinction vaccinating people reduce spread directly, vaccinating people reduce spread indirectly reduce mortality. 
&amp;nbsp; 
I imagine person conference, wedding, concert flight. telling vaccinated metaphorically ""spouts extreme nuclear radiation"", vaccinated people *arent*? difference trabsmissibility Delta (and probably Mu too) vaccinated unvaccinated people small. 
 
So unvaccinated people uniquely subject nuclear meltdown infecting hundreds people whereas vaccinated aren't... mandating people get vaccinated spontaneously become symptomatic decline condition ""feeling good"", ""put deathbed"" course 3-5 hours? quite obvious status unvaccinated people anything higher risk position choose, real consequence depending age comorbidities, they're manipulating chances severe illness. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
The big glaring externality here, since COVID infection Delta variant infection, person chooses vaccinated severe illness, ends hospital one person infect healthcare workers cohabitators. honest average person's rate hospitalization too. Last checked (it could different now) hospitalization rate averaged across risk categories, 0.5 percent. 1 200. 
ie. mandate vaccine 200 person sample size, reduce exposure COVID infected patient healthcare worker housemates 1. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
Is good ROI? situation change moving forward since putting selection pressure replication variants spread well among vaccinated people? 
 
The NHS interesting study nurses measured transmission vaccinated nurses vaccinated housemates. wait symptoms, blanket testing set intervals. think like per week housemates much often nurses themselves. 
The study pre-Delta variant, vaccinated-to-vaccinated transmission 35%. vaccine seemed help lot. 
 
Post-Delta appearance, seeing study (the one linked) peer review telling us vaccine reducing spread vaccinated people others. least, little reduce spread, results could considered within margin error. 
 
I data mind thay informs impression well vaccine reducing spread, overly impressed. I'm vaccinated benefit still. advise others get vaccinated. misinformation hype train ending spread curbing new variants increasing pressure people vaccinated via mandates advisable opinion. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 

I foresee variants arising plenty unfettered unappreciated spread (spread replication go hand hand) coming vaccinated people running around acting though part system. 
 
Then bureaucrat updates people MSM starts pounding masses ""new information"", they'll find something else blame fact COVID still exists.

Correct. organize Facebook private groups, brigade IRL - real life. number moms hate masks surrounding counties come school district children in, yell pro maskers, monopolize time speaking misinformation masks.  Per source, 16-24 year olds marginally suggested rate herd immunity (at 85.4% antibodies, compared 87% herd immunity). think we'd seeing level cases - 2/3 peak almost-entirely unvaccinated population, growing day - purely attributable &lt;15% 16-24 year olds without antibodies. Far likely efficacy vaccines preventing reinfection waned considerably, particularly new delta variant. serious? lol  almost schoolboard town/county meeting attracts craziest people.

It's organic. numerous private facebook groups dedicated crashing school boards anti-mask propaganda. missing point. *unvaccinated* tend *sickest* (that's fact). could denied service hospital decides clear ICU bed another sick person better chance survival. **This rationing care works - waste resources limited chance survival, will, general, unvaccinated**.

The last 4 years questionable. insistence seems like millions adults LITERALLY acting like toddlers concept things others community... non invasive wearing masks... shakes belief good people core. sure respect people future...

I know. need respond... guess reinforcing said kind putting something writing thinking while.

Thanks opportunity honest myself. I'm kinda tempted fist fight schoolboard meeting right now, NGL.  CDC, scientific community. functioning understanding efficacy infection important right now. long hospitalization/death par original numbers, feel vaccines provided unvaccinated.

This probably right thing big picture assume doses indeed transferred elsewhere. course something said duty others. That's moral debate. Auckland is. Flights restricted amount miq spots available.  Maybe there's news English Israel? news articles English Portugal, people would care Portugal. Portugal overall well. deaths per million, US #21 world, Portugal, #31, Israel, #79. Portugal Israel nearly comparable population amounts. folks still talk unvaccinated already COVID refuse vaccinated say immunity. 

I‚Äôm really curious, many folks admitted already recovered COVID getting infected again?

I get want still vaccinated. Sterilized Immunity etc. reserve percentage beds vaccinated. Adjust % accordingly data collect. beds never given unvaccinated patients. also reserve beds non covid related issues well. 

Unvaccinated first come first serve remaining beds. I'm surprised low that. phrase can't without monster. typical strategy: tie cause phrase really reflect cause impossible against. 

Masks save Oh, like children smile? guy hates children!   Sad Max Verstappen noises. would Mercedes this?!   struck record, one going hear ;(  People created priors heads Israel months ago kept thoughts concrete time gone on. biggest somehow ""Israel vaccinated country"" started fast, fact quite low compared countries, take total population account. Honestly seems pretty safe. assume mom/dad vaccinated worst case would happen state level databases. went one registered electronic version card. probably don‚Äôt push medical records automatically, easier ask, far know something could query. might vary state, unfortunately. 

There absolutely national database, though. That's point, point *unvaccinated* tend *sickest*, least chance recovery, therefore could denied service people better chance survival. point self correcting, implemented full, unvaccinated clearly receive lower priority given choices made (all else equal). baseless speculation protection popular/dangerous strains Covid included annual flu shot. small government conservatives attacking pleas wear masks take vaccines government tyranny happy see government spending comes time admitted. adults ashamed Get FDA approved surgical mask ASTM level 3 pretty damn good. flimsy thing Amazon. accurate title is, ""Student mocked adults preposterously claiming died COVID-19 *because one person wear mask.*  People dying needlessly considered emergency, wearing piece paper is. would make many people's work environments pleasant, let's hope bozos put money mouth is. need vaccines arms, open job listings.

My guess get jab rather quit. course is, would otherwise able track you! (/s) think denied care outright available, believe things happen cases continue climb:

1. Vaccinated individuals get priority due (likely) greater survival rate everything else equal. include long waits non-vaxx'd ER outright.
2. Extremely sick people stressed hospitals may get palliative care pain management- ventilator. still care based resources available.
3. Insurance start denying claims making people pay pocket.

More less, here's morphine $250,000 bill.  gimme   interesting see numbers coming UK. one hand, amazing see well vaccines preventing death. hand, crazy cases insanely high two months straight sign stopping. death rate slowly creeping too. craziest thing else world insane case numbers. wonder using AstraZeneca vaccine?

Hahaha really making good public health vaccine mandatory tyranny. adult. getting vaccine. God decide time up.‚Äù

I sincerely hope every asshole honestly believes crap everyone favor stays home prays it‚Äôs time go hospital Covid complications chose vaccinated, everyone else got critical car accident heart attack deserves bed selfish ass taking up. mom works nurse lives you, precautions seems sort pointless. you‚Äôre asking advice, I‚Äôd say go live life. That's problem people....literally *nothing* change views behavior literally face face possible death. simply nothing else allow people face consequences (in)actions. Well many folks talking media nowadays aren‚Äôt ethicists medical professionals all. least applaud Stern looking science data, listened medical professionals agree experts vaccination works. standard EN 14683:2019 Type II (R) people outside US. standard mask used healthcare setting.

(the R splash resistance, type II filtration efficiency)  completely meaningless compare date metrics metrics exact date year before, even truly believe fairly unsubstantiated hypothesis COVID strong non-behavioral seasonal component. becomes even meaningless ignore vastly different restrictions place time period. really feel like data shows should. feels like whole 8 months thing either want exact timeline everyone get boosters, think saying need booster 6 months makes vaccine looks bad something. 8 months seem real basis data, problem it. Read comment context. predictions. I'm pointing additional predictions made ignorant course pandemic. ...and people want sympathy money get sick either die horribly sick point hospitalization. Screw y'all. comments us sane people wanting die true, I'll damned cry tears see obituaries.  dude, worry. known vaccination paradox.

Think - almost everyone vaccinated, almost hospitalizations would vaccinated group, even tiny number way less would otherwise.

It normalised per 1000 something avoid this. its* employees work home, apostrophe needed   pompous comment like obligatory preface going go characterize debate theologically based restriction rights citizens ""giving latitude issue.""  far policy goes probably vaccinated people, showing proof vaccination, get admitted ahead patients extreme circumstances. 
 
Otherwise verify anti-vax person vs vaxxed person? can't admit them. 
 
So emergency rooms, checking everyone in, proof vax get admitted ahead someone unvaxxed. 
 
This sounds extreme think people understand bad things going get. case loads already overloading hospitals going keep getting worse, like last year, end January 2022. slowly get less worse several months hospitals back par care provide many people need it. 
 
That likely situation imo. Areas hit hardest today could get lot restrictive gathering, masks, vaccines, etc could change trajectory assumption going see areas US go happened India see significant change. 
 
It also seems possible fast delta spreads could see worst effects much sooner january 2022 covid infected everyone, killing knows many, things might ~~be better~~ less worse sooner expected increased resistance future infections....? seems like wishful thinking. happening year virus come back before, expect keep coming back differently every year least 5 years trying like hell prevent spread every reasonable way possible. 
 
Reasonable currently standing farther apart, wearing mask getting vaccine. Probably need stop large door events sports arena's stadiums well unless everyone vaccinated. know vaccines Chile using, seem good job comes vaccinations. 
My point want school re-openings, need aggressive vaccinating children.  Wow, powerful quote! haven‚Äôt come across before. can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs animated series. Good idea. Misinformation tax‚Ä¶.hmmm.  No, COVID last December headache fatigue.  It‚Äôs awesome do, time it‚Äôs infuriating folks survive regret getting shot, needlessly puts you, colleagues families risk breakthrough infection risk new variant developing. It‚Äôs kind like folks ones saw someone burn hand hot stove didn‚Äôt learn experience also touch hot stove cry afterwards bc didn‚Äôt think would burned them. whole thing sucks, way, real tragedy.

Yep true... also reason unvaccinated ones moved - reason anyone needs moved ICU first place. stopping everyone getting booster right now? pretty easy go place say immunocompromised want get first shot Gosh never ever thought cost helicopter ride US hospital..  100% agree. eligible (sans mitigating health issue) gotten now, get fucked. Maybe local veterinarian see you. twisted concept "" Standing values"" even risk profit . outright insanity partial vaccination going give protection? supposed get second dose soon, appears I‚Äôm getting sick now. Sore throat nowhere. I‚Äôm getting tested hours hope get results back couple days. covid, first dose primed immune system enough keep mild? I‚Äôm 27 good health part (little sedentary bad. Skinny.) point believe rights begin end. right go without mask, get vaccinated greater right get sick. essence ok die due stupidity. Sorry buying it. Rights come responsibility, people plain ass selfish. real sense understanding responsibilities freedom. hope so, Israel stuff still worried, since high risk before. really go many places tho, does, still wears actual N95 masks. That's better! [Now here's actual study blood clot risk vaccination much higher virus, 10 times higher types clot.  think basically saying decided require vaccines new employees convincing current employees get vaccinated definitely awkward clunky writing. That's first thing came mind well. Sure, booster increase antibodies immediately provide long term benefit 2 doses month 2 wasted dose could utilized much better. 

Unfortunately knowing take time studies already done understand hesitancy approve boosters everyone. makes sense risk though given spread delta variant is, even short term benefit would crucial people. I‚Äôm aware this. Though say every patient comes sick unvaccinated.  Goes show age always make wiser myself‚Ä¶   course anti vaxxers let littles take vaccine. means we'll even bigger mess. works large insurance corporation fb page absolutely flooded comments warms cold, dead heart.

We already do, organ transplants, donor organs short supply it'd immorally wasteful dole first-come-first-serve basis.

Oh hey would look that: ICU beds also short supply now! Nurses' time short supply! booster 

Do you? giving boosters yet unless meet specific conditions. They're focusing getting everyone primary dose. Millions milliseconds! Actually, matters. personal outlook. half country gets destroyed virus, family able make through, happy situation. 
I feel bad people getting sick dying, I'm going waste energy shedding tear people stupid selfish basic painless things protect around them. upsets core. really hate people right now. refusal even LISTEN proof major breakdown society. poor kid. school board meeting. 

I‚Äôm sure size it‚Ä¶? Los Angeles County ten million people, doesn‚Äôt mean everyone school board meeting local. You‚Äôre right, wish would take vaccine. types people currently vaccinated anger something respond fuels fire. wish answer wake help heart around think they‚Äôve hardened hearts much there‚Äôs almost way get suffer consequences. work childcare tipped de escalation use children totally works adults, haha

""I see upset. I'll ready talk hear calm voice.""

""I can't help people shouting me. Please give room ready help calm.""  CDC guidelines, US. Yeah, quite get happened. Maybe employees chokepoint disease, since see people average? Coronavirus float. Seeing people act station surprise me. thought Delta gonna mandate seeing middle seat block longest time. Guess we'll see one saying Christians anti maskers. I‚Äôm Christian. Venn diagram pretty close circle antimaskers are. 

The states worst covid full born agains. think is? 85% white evangelical born Christians voted Abbott TX. Apologies, right, misread. risk serious blood clots occurring 1 92,000, risk death due blood clots 1 470,000 say. I'll edit post correct mistake. 

They follow saying ""the clots appear common younger people"" think still reasonable suggest risks vaccine would outweigh benefits, unfortunately provide risk profiles age. **I think data misleading**. 

I looking data one interesting thing stood me. look shows latest data point many people hospitalized vaccinated, vs many hospitalized vaccinated.

Those total numbers add entire population Colorado, including 0yo+ data. Looking census data, 18.1% people Colorado &lt;12 years old (so eligible get vaccinated yet). likely 0% &lt;12yo people vaccinated. Also, secret &lt;12yo MUCH less likely hospitalized first place.

So propose much fair comparison would remove children altogether:

* Colorado population (according data): 5,763,976
* Colorado pop excluding &lt;12yo (by removing 18.1%): 4,720,695
* Number vaccinated people 3,079,652
* Number unvacc'd people 1,641,043
* New hospitalized case rate Vaccd: 109 cases / 3,079,652 people (per 100,000) = **3.53** (Same before)
* New hospitalized case rate non-vac: 355 cases / 1,641,043 people (per 100,000) = **21.63**!!

I think normalized data provides fair comparison since children (&lt;12yo) represented vaccinated group, children represented unvaccinated group. comparing apples apples, since kids skew numbers.

Before 3.5 rate vs 13.2 rate hospitalization vaccination status = ""3.7 times less likely hospitalized"". 
Normalized data removing uneligible children 3.53 vs 21.63 = **""6.1 times less likely hospitalized""**

I would imagine would find something similar total deaths.

Feedback appreciated.

-----

__TL:DR - unfair include non-eligible children statistics since skews data favor non-vaccd. normalize data removing people &lt;12 years old, numbers likely 6.1 times less likely hospitalized (almost twice much!). That's good point, thanks. even definitive CDC recommendation yet. allegedly happening 9/20 knows anymore.

I've heard pharmacies give boosters doses throw away. walk anywhere say immunocompromised get booster right now. That's gets me: several religious people know believe rights deny service people like, people want deny service, get upset. tried explaining double standard ignored changed topic. planes, boats, cars, scooters, people find hard wear mask lick doorknobs... yes.   California done fairly good job vaccinating everyone else, especially 65+. Correct, unfortunately article poor job summarizing this. Though study ([page appears estimate 100% mask usage result 32% reduction cases diagnosed symptoms.

My reading study cost vs benefit mask wearing general population specifically test effectiveness different types masks. study focused heavily methods promoting mask usage costs benefit ratio.   One reasons glad moved DC couple years ago opposed certain places. DC schools actually give shit arent actively trying kill kid.

I still can't wait till kids get vaccinated.... I'm sorry. I've caring elderly years. understand precious time is, especially know likely lose soon. last birthday, family meal evening spent reminiscing - precious memories. remaining time stolen you. There's nothing say take pain away, I'm sending warm thoughts.

I mixed feelings study. really help case (by ""our"", mean people like strongly advocate masking.)

The absolute risk reduction 1%. (The relative risk reduction 9.3%).

For vaccines, absolute risk reduction 1.2% Moderna 0.84% Pfizer. However relative risk reduction Mrna vaccines 95%. 

I think important encourage vaccination masking. Probably still important promote both, vaccination makes profound difference study suggests promoting masking make difference, anywhere near large difference vaccination.

The Food Drug Administration‚Äôs decision last month grant full approval Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine already prompted Pentagon require members military vaccinated. Mr. Biden said time approval sweep away lingering doubts vaccination spur mandates.

When asked Mr. Biden would adding detail existing policies would outline measures would immediate broad effect Americans, Ms. Psaki replied: ‚ÄúIt depends you‚Äôre vaccinated not.‚Äù

Administration officials see signs people United States open receiving shots ‚Äî 14 million got first shots August, four million July, Ms. Psaki said. 27 percent eligible U.S. population age 12 older received Covid vaccinations, according data Centers Disease Control Prevention. hardest-hit states, unvaccinated percentage higher: 42 percent Texas, instance, 38 percent Florida.

About 1.3 million fully vaccinated people received third shot federal officials approved people compromised immune systems. Mr. Biden publicly supported idea broadening availability third shots boosters much population, health experts advised White House hold promoting now.
On Wednesday, Ms. Psaki said White House working toward plan boosters, give time frame. told reporters Mr. Biden chosen Thursday deliver extensive speech virus understood ‚Äútop mind Americans‚Äù return schools offices.

Sad days they're starting feel necessity, becoming necessity, triage like this. Well maybe antivaxxers since love gobble shit. one died plane crash, blunt force trauma plane crash.... Nope. people making excuses. overweight eating much. completely possible lose weight thus become healthier even eating nothing McDonalds. Sorry, buddy, ""food desert"" anywhere ever forced anyone stuff face. let put fucking masks on, holy fuck. scary legal slope though. people cause accidents get denied care also one day? swerved wrong lane fell ladder? someone take medication prescribed? person got cancer ""voluntary"" exposure, live?

Age group swim meets dynamic. weekend events mostly hanging races. fail terms audience able conceptualize time. typical person probably conceptualize time minutes beyond 90 minutes. say ""I wait 2 hours, 3 hours, 16 hours!"" say ""OMG, Jenny, wait 1020 minutes seen!"" say ""I wait 17 hours seen!""

Let's get accurate title:

Student mocked childish people 18 sharing grandmother died Covid-19  acknowledging religious preference something simultaneously suspending religious preference. believe that's protected right. However, think people need provide proof actually part religion get vaccines, none far say that. vaccine reference number saved database. went vacation, island required proof vaccination take picture card write ID/reference number vaccines got.  think it‚Äôs triage situation. They‚Äôre giving care actually make difference, regardless vaccination status. called daughter's respiratory illness (which thought COVID she'd sick ears hurt), specifically told us bring office. 

But, set arrive, go in, call specific number, someone gowns comes get you, go specific rooms. signs them, sick visits only, marker indicate cleaned yet.

Also, might Dr place get COVID test done kid.

HOWEVER:

I think woman background smirking found fact grandma died directly funny instead notion reason died due anti maskers I've seen many saying. 

Personally think kind smirk give someone says something totally disagree roll eyes smirk ridiculous statement, see someone talent show using dead relative sob story garner affection (not doing). 

She said grandma died ""because people wearing masks"". stupid compute. context, worse anti maskers we've seen many of, i.e. willfully stupid utterly deserving scorn ridicule. quite much someone would laugh face notion someone love died. (really small) difference. felt important point out. there‚Äôs whole sugar addiction / soda lobby factor there.

So get pass manipulated making unhealthy choice? think something else falls category‚Ä¶ Florida Man strikes  people shouldn‚Äôt play telephone news.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Wait kids able get vaccinated things go back normal? don‚Äôt see point continuing masking/ distancing everyone wants get vaccinated (once kids can). threshold herd immunity seems unattainable atleast US. Exactly! people raise hell every time Muslims breathe there.  would wager outspoken ones would love take sticks wanting force vaccinated, I'm afraid brutal enforcement would entrench further. 

I agree: deny services chose get, people forcefully vaccinating would fulfill doomsday fantasies. Let people lie beds make keep harming everyone else, denying rights. (note: rights luxuries)

edit: know someone expects FEMA pull unmarked van cart away. willing happen rather get vaccine. watched whole video..

I understand anti-mask parents. always existed, wonder school sucked. lol.


This one balanced anti pro masks. affordability alone stark contrast.

This uncommon finding dedicated family doctor / GP hard. However said walk ins take people every day wait (here least) bad (on average, pre-pandemic).


I'm sure anecdotal stories exemplars either side (care Canada awesome/sucks spectrum), whole good system saves thousands lives every day, result life-altering financial burden.

I expect took *actual* experiences Americans Canadians, across spectrum, time, find average level care comparable individual cost significantly lower. lower end economic spectrum difference would stark (especially account seek receive care due prohibitive costs). feel like delta wave covid‚Äôs big death rattle, it‚Äôs downhill here. recently hold 16 minutes able leave voicemail. end result got send picture MyChart doctor.
