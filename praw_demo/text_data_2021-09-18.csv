0,2021-09-18,"   Still sucks quite much lol. Thanks info. Still ""too young"" get Shingrex even though know people age it.

I ended getting chicken pox like one two years vaccine. luck lol. guess least remember least, that's rough. So, avoided vaccine I'm scared needles (they give Ativan hospital blood work). Tried pick first dose first, clinic out. Started showing symptoms 6th, diagnosed 10th. really wish gotten vaccine, I'm gonna get I'm well.  expected to? People guess husband rapist moved avoid prison doxxed victim. trying move attention away him. Pointing someone’s stupidity also spreading misinformation public forum attacking correcting. disgusting they’re hogging limited supply monoclonal antibodies now. probably shorten “Nicki’s Swollen Balls”. posterity. got diagnosed COVID last Friday, packet gave said could donate plasma antibody therapies. thing? That's learned it, back 2004. thankfully thus level confirmation unnecessary private Quaker school attended kid mostly outdoor classes indoor mask mandate. 

Private schools large spectrum. There’s religious schools, preparatory schools, alternative schools, etc. educate people beliefs educate into? Hopefully vaxxed get bonuses death another human never good thing, unless they're genocidal maniac. price come down, think Costco Shingrex $160 something like two shots. got right came even wait six months two doses available.

I chickenpox age 2 weeks - way vaccines childhood diseases invented. piss unfair disgusting. Personally care masks. Sure it'll great they're gone huge issue it.
I huge issue people still realize way vaccination.. Shame state Idaho Govenor .    ""There far fall last year."" 

**We compare disease disease season season**; that’s absolutely appropriate. Viruses mutate; it’s do. every dang year flu, example. 

Point being, 

There literally ***are*** far cases last year. know transmissible Delta is. 

And kids still unvaccinated. 

And mitigation measures still work better nothing. Covid? all! Makes sense vaccine. I’m still relying immune response!! peak Minaj trend music swollen balls. Well deserved. cvs said allowed give one vaccine other. fda approved whatever. dangerous ignore that? think it’s bit Streisand effect. fact even subject discussion makes lose faith humanity. Valid point.  Oregon. That's one helluva headline. headline absolutely 100% /r/nottheonion material.

It ranks pretty highly list headlines think I'd ever read.   Thanks makes sense, realized parents aren’t even 65 yet. Lol oops.  infuriating time effort wasted bullshit. always firmly believe distract rapist/murderer husbands court cases. Everyone talking covid statements, talking husband. guess series events retrospect already started. push equality, quality education, higher news standards (lower tolerance sensationalism), possibly demonstrations bring attention issue people working slow changes snowball better future.

The current wealthy people owning news sources buying politicians thing makes less likely still possible.  It’s like crazies would ever stop boarder. gotta fix won’t anywhere world.  Even chance dying infected same, chance dying *in general* multiplied chance getting infected begin with.

But watched meeting, advisory board's reasoning. Instead concerned higher chance spreading around.   beat climate change? That's pretty strong statement going need back sounds awfully antivaxx. FDA doctors never said damn thing along lines. repeatedly call vaccines safe. Hell damn vaccine fully approved FDA. telling fully approved vaccine actually believe may destroy immune systems? Dear lord. think world deserves know mere debate booster. Yes would subject confidentiality. Well that's big issue. Younger generations remember things. remember queuing Polio vaccine four years old excited getting it. measles, german measles chicken pox. people recover scary. asked teenagers knew stop spitting years ago explain TB understand shouldn't. problem complacency really.  people vote too. stop treating them? unvaccinated person shows COVID, issue standard horse paste send back home. Everyone's happy! poor dude. Probably made stupid lie get married he’s hiding somewhere hoping die down. agree, fired.


Out cannon, sun. got interested mRNA vaccine made.  It’s really vitro trnascription dna purification.  It’s clean process could imagine. experience back day working rna extremely fragile required sorts cleaning RNAse prevention due propensity broken down. actually surprised scalable durable is.  airlines mandate domestically. They're afraid losing revenue. needs federal mandate. Anyone refuses vaccine, submits religious medical exemption, required undergo weekly testing, using self-testing kits provided city. adhere testing requirement face “adverse employment action,” per mayor’s order.

Surprised give option test. sense triggering immune system fight virus effectively?   dumb Weird would require vaccine mandates businesses. Say again, y'all! cardi   five? Seems like big issue week ago. “ ohhh people really LIE?” “ can’t believe it!!” lawyer claimed vaccination cards arbitrarily rejected Black restaurant racist. long wait post second shot? kind feel bad cousin. Unless got std someone right going married. That’s cool. cool all, Nicki’s big-balled cousin. Yeah look [this deaths versus births Alabama trend already happening. COVID-19 accelerated it.  evil brother exactly large data sets useful anncedotal stories not. 

When comes individual cases anything possible. 

Data used differentiate possible probable. 

Hope makes sense you. Sadly, true  long wait post second shot?   Nicki Minaj

only known big butt Australia, likely walked owing cent  long wait second dose? got second April 15 j wanna go October 1st prepare wedding two weeks later. 

Not sure 5.5 months early nah I'm thinking New Zealand now?    Thank Idgaf swollen balls more. Brazil highest amount cases today since pandemic began last 24 hours (125,053 exact). reason huge number however, two states large population (such São Paulo Rio de Janeiro) included backlog data managed register way back beginning pandemic now.

I'm still optimistic though, country vaccinated 66% population least one dose, along 37% fully vaccinated  sudden tv show ""Zoo"" starting make lot sense. Hah, seen studies defining long covid 2 (yes, ""TWO"") weeks...  article freaking ""nature"" signs, abnormal clinical parameters persisting two weeks COVID-19 onset return healthy baseline potentially considered long-term effects disease""""

Of course crap gets widely quoted everywhere. Sigh. ""science"" like needs tabloids?

But, yes, agree, anything shorter 1 month meaningless, 2-3 months probably even reasonable... doctor prescribed? Article like details Replied poster people experienced myocarditis first dose, appear previously COVID-19 infection, Kim noted. suggests myocarditis following mRNA vaccination requires initial exposure, either COVID-19 infection first dose mRNA vaccine, added. possible people received different technology first dose, switched mRNA vaccine second dose, people could also experience heart inflammation issues, though data needed, de Lemos noted.

And rare present, risk experiencing heart inflammation younger men 16.1 per one million doses. don’t however right specific job. made choice, company made choice. Everyone happy.   people experienced myocarditis first dose, appear previously COVID-19 infection, Kim noted. suggests myocarditis following mRNA vaccination requires initial exposure, either COVID-19 infection first dose mRNA vaccine, added. possible people received different technology first dose, switched mRNA vaccine second dose, people could also experience heart inflammation issues, though data needed, de Lemos noted.

One correction, putting perceived needs society. truth society individual benefit vaccine. thinking well. Though, finally got whatever available. got Moderna, despite wanted, fluke. Yes mortally acceptable.   remember reading article recommended twitter women complaining periods getting jab made realise periods abnormally painful month vs time women complained cycle messed up. article also stated effect vaccines menstrual cycles studied still think that's good enough reason vaccinate. Big business back charge America. Well, one negative effect drain laboratory plastics used perform experiments, also impacts researchers biological disciplines. vanity unnecessary testing done, longer continues kid, spent 15hrs surgery 1.5 weeks induced coma another 3.5 weeks rehabilitation severe car accident another couple months follow ups.

So America probably like 6 10 million. think thought would grow obviously don’t. r/nottheonion Vaxxed people aren’t dying anywhere near rate unvaccinated, I’d argue ones countless co-morbidities. going listen tsk tsk’ing fuck feelings crowd.  I've seen Reddit reject articles Scientific American.

But theadvertiser okay? This. Vote Brawndo2021

It electrolytes. hope aren’t birthing anymore anti vaxxers people always insane can’t hide anymore. also certain orange buffoon show act like repercussions let crazy asshole flag fly. We've reached point sympathy willful unvaccinated patients gone need focus need urgent care may related Covid all.

It choice roll dice assume they'd get fine despite warnings. matter if, when. even protesting about? Sorry misunderstood said making claims. part clear.

So posts video instead publishing findings peer reviewed journal? That's pretty fishy. He's quoted calling vaccines ""needle rape"". Per knowledge, mRNA vaccines train body create spike protein immune system learns builds response. That's natural response immune system limited knowledge biology cannot explain mechanism would cause immune system ""weaken"" it. You’re better off. Brawndo plants crave. Brawndo electrolytes.  Republicans calling queen red pilled kekw Wow. crazy think about. Please provide evidence obesity infects others two friends mine breakthrough cases Delta last month. fully vaccinated May (Pfizer), still kicked ass 3 days (felt like super bad cold), anywhere near bad OG COVID last January/February lasted 2 weeks.

Uh, think mean extra *horse*power!  Facebook bullshit. rounds social media. agree. I’ve heard family taking hospitals sick family, giving food without dr. consent, clearly following dosage rules.   I'm quoting someone else's text. probably right, care. Ride Never Stops! live place Covid free. I’m sorry misunderstood empathy dealing situations far worse live. Tis silly planet.  Yes everyone get vaccine could still end hospital it. Vaccines haven’t ended pandemic. college seems think longer offering tests symptomatic you’ll need car $150 get test rural area. matter refusers. They've already determined nothing going happen them.  Obviously Alabama address limiting abortion services even more. went Hawaii recently required proof negative test proof vaccination fly. Masks obviously still required felt much comfortable flight knowing could remove mask bite eat sip water without much risk. got second dose Moderna 15th zero symptoms times. Well, tender arm. Weird. ""Immunity"" previously infected neither 100% permanent. great opportunity find real time risk assessments. Along opportunity costs. one heck test. Sammme! Yes thank you, edit personally can't hold someone else low risk, choose get vaccine carries risk. I'm saying bad side effects likely anything like that, risk putting anything body can't demand stranger take risk benefit.

I may wish everyone get vaccinated does, personally know everyone's reasoning experience, especially low risk low risk ending hospitals, can't call murderers, shame them, harbor animosity toward group.

One example. friend whose dad received vaccine within last year (I think shingles vax I'm totally sure), horrible allergic reaction it. ended hospital almost died. nervous getting Covid vaccine. know whatever reaction might hereditary, clear vaccine reacted to. decided get Covid vax that, even though doctor says would likely fine, would never hold taking risk someone else's benefit. I'm sure decided get it, ended hospital, would said wished got (she fact get vaccinated without issue). Even friend stranger's story, think deserve die feel bad them. know everyone's story since majority know vaccinated reasons like originally posted, agree vitriol aimed choose get vaccinated.

I want thank civil response.🙂 always hesitant post anything like posted see lot name calling shouting down. company didn’t actually damn thing. Influenza mutates fast eradicate it.  
The Flu vaccine got last week inoculates three strains. might 10 20 circulation - fast answer really, scientists pick **a few** variants think make people dangerously ill, say 'let's vaccinate these'. Say make appointment maybe first available date. also might little nervous vaccine, still willing take it. Another possibility wanted time vaccination going work afterwards. I’m Pfizer gang glad vaccinated! offered offered I’m happy either way lol! Mildly troubling trends. COVID another nail coffin. 

I expect world perfect predictable generation seen 2 market crashes, pandemic, 20 year war minimal efforts address environmental problems. Well lot us children can't blame Avocado toast. test shove q-tip nose like to, take weekly vaccinations :P Yay good know! worrying due MS.  Wow, I'm sorry know many people outside neighborhood. Yeah doctor prescribed dose followed directions, still ended Hosptial, would say isn’t entirely fault  grew next canada. really radically different US: stupid universal.   got tested happened. Negative, gone visit parents wanted know. I've gotten Moderna jabs.

The first jab, got really sleepy arm sore 12 hrs later.

The 2nd jab, fine 12 hrs later arm started hurting felt little weird. still able work next day.

No issues since. honestly care get this. That's it. much better gotten vaccine whole population complies gets ""naturally"" immunized storm COVID, Moderna bombed virus every side. 

Having approved/authorized vaccine fault. We're alive 1.5 years pandemic, possibly also without long Covid. go on. perfectly possibile COVID live forever, endemic become.

Delta variant estinguishing variants, also peaks *fast* waves tend shorter anti-vaxxers tend hit hardest. immunized population bigger before, closer herd immunity. shit is. care getting alive hopefully mentally sane 100 new part time jobs available Indiana, yay! Seems reasonable grim sort way. vaccine, could take insurance company spend much money. take it, probably believe pay difference.

&amp;#x200B;

""But year, insurers reinstated co-pays deductibles covid patients, many cases even vaccines became widely available.""

Oh well, nevermind then. Nothing noble reason that. Lady grapes? Thanks new favorite term. Source patient, dropped balls Bye Felicia keep wrong people getting help?? Surely way. shit. distract husband rapist currently facing 10 years prison failing register sex offender California. Oh hear quarantine from? Maybe CDC? Yeah dude clear logic screwed. left conversation called early on. want dont voice uniformed postion unless want encorage people die go hospital next time get it. people want live need them. knocked ass bad 18 hours 2nd moderna shot along bunch buddies. low mid 40’s, guess worth  Moderna win 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

While line first moderna shot woman front me. worst. complained wait long (I waited maybe 25 minutes). said happy getting phizer. said everyone knows got moderna soooo sick. said didn’t trust Moderna, blah blah blah. came pregnant asked shot getting. told Moderna. stopped talking that. could possibly say? 

I think time time. wonder knows news?   ""It's never lupus"". also new varients emerge unvacinated population. pangolin spikes higher affinity hACE2. furin cleavage site improved delta's P681R mutation, there's reason believe paper could better. later 1918 H1N1 waves killed many people 20s could read historical warning things certainly get worse.

I've got vaccine though got B-cells T-cells I'm particularly worried, rest unvaccinated world could still get hammered something worse. keep giving lottery tickets virus. still vaccine under-12s. People definitely dying Florida, new admissions hospitals also way down. Thursday huge hospital group AdventHealth announced 48% peak going back ""green"" status aka going back normal operations. said across nose, it! Aka: Come here, naughty. :) also spaced doses 2-3 months may help durability.
 
""May."" seems likely 5-6 month expiration countdown starts second dose, whenever happened. point right , vaccines effective

Yes, ""right now"". 

Of course antibodies effectiveness wane. challenge find expert says anything contrary. Israelis somehow different Canadians. 

Maybe Canadian government approve boosters general public. maybe not. least time comes, benefits risks clearer. family friend fell anti-vaccine propaganda long time finally went got first dose pfizer two half weeks ago, suppose get second dose today. Today, COVID 19. Shes 80, also minimal underlying health conditions keeps shape worked outside daily got it.

What exactly chances pulling through? Swollen balls make infertile though, it’s called orchitis it’s caused mumps virus coincidentally vaccine preventable illness much like covid. friend tell that's iffy vaccine friends told affected periods. told either lying actually closely paying attention periods time paranoia exaggerating symptoms. 

Told vaccine April, J&amp;J, nothing normal annoying periods since then. irregularities worse cramps. mean ya, also wanna leave. nyc resident exactly call nice place :/ wait confirmed Covid Feb 2020, got vaccinated Pfizer (when mind asking?) got Covid again???? fearing Mu /Lambda/The ""unnamed"" variant South Africa... fit right now, point variants either become extinct negligible. Covid likely continue Delta lineage. fine me, courage  fine right?

Depending live might get ICU bed something COVID-19 maybe not.     Private school parent here. could say ours. 100% masking, high vaccination rates staff snd eligible students, outdoor lunch talking, many layers. covid transmission, families urged follow guidelines socializing campus. title read, “We many irresponsibly stupid healthcare employees we’d far many actually right thing.” imagine task request

Antibodies circulate Blood Lymph (even tissue/mucosa) several ways interacting foreign stuff make harmless / neutralize it. Antibodies prevent Infection first place, overwhelmed sheer numbers inoculum (the pathogen load receive upon first infection)

T- B-cells produce Antibodies first place. B cells produce known soluable antibodies cells carry antibodies around surface interact e.g infected cells kill (they provide intracellular security antibodies provide extracellular security).

So Antibodies prevent infection (or, extent, prevent infection spreading), B- T-cells a) produce Antibodies (from memory cells vaccinated previously infected, else takes 7-8 days B- T-cell reaction kick in) b) seek destroy infected cells, leading clearing infection cases.

In ideal scenario, Antibodies ""more important"" (but keep mind, antibodies without B-cells) prevent infection. since Delta dramatically increased viral load, antibody counts overwhelmed thats B- T-cells come play.

No, definitely doctors medication choices. /s 

I seen multiple complaints social media this. denied ivermectin vitamins desire treat Covid home, instead it’s wait see certain symptoms come hospital that’s people die Covid, don’t want go there. 

I don’t want go hospital either. That’s accepted solutions highest likeliehood keeping going - masks vaccines. don’t even know want anymore. think want covid mild flu promised, doesn’t happen it’s ravaging body, realize SOL options promising. blame options, fact due severely entrenched disease. can’t covid “that bad.” Somehow make fault medical community, begging get vaccinated approaching year now. cost would vary program.

Dude look basic statistics  DEATH. CULT. died yet. patient question checked out. ran local elections far right (incl anti vax) platform.

Fauci said CNN interview couple hours ago Friday recommendation ""is end story"" expects booster recommendation expanded broad swath population couple weeks. also said ""we recommend people wait get point fall category recommended"" guess piss FDA much, pretty clear interview agree recommendation. Unlikely unless they've got unusually weak immune systems. 

CDC's guidance vast majority infected people longer infectious within 10 days first symptoms; may continue test positive several months (shedding virus parts shredded immune system?), positive test indication capable infecting someone else.

Let’s take mid number both. 10 *million* human fucking lives (wives, husbands, sons daughters) ONE SINGLE LIFE could change needed better worse.

You cannot win mindset since knowing something, them, extremely uncomfortable opposed learning opportunity us. Exactly. Chris Rock much better position vaccinated. chances ending hospital significantly lower. know plenty people got vaccinated still caught covid yet they've ended fine yet high risk covid. Like coworker early 40s severe asthma(hospitalised twice past years) epilepsy yet caught covid ended fine. doubt vaccine job saved life  Well, would imported variant point.  much research specific thing asking for. Best estimates, roughly give take 150 cases per 100,000 hospitalized (based CDC data). That's still significantly higher myocarditis numbers reported getting vaccine. Considering we've still seen hospitalizations COVID despite fully vaccinated, odds favor get booster.

Last checked, numbers myocarditis Israel something like 275 5 million. There's almost zero chance number higher breakthrough infection results myocarditis (which require hospitalization all). Especially consider studies citing 450 per million young males.

If myocarditis issue huge deal, there's way panel would carved exception health care workers high occupational hazards (teachers predominant ones). miniscule risk best.

Or

“This movie terrible, liked 6. 5⭐️” saying people need hide experiences idiots misinterpret lives? new variant comes vaccine effective previous infection protective. Likely yes. many people delta, really can’t another large wave winter. It’ll become endemic, don’t think we’ll see hospital overruns 100,000’s dying.

Next variant likely going derivative delta, everyone infected atleast partial immunity despite genetic drift.  clarify bit comment case. 


Not long ago government started PAYING people get vaccine shots order boost vaccination rates. However people like got double vaxxed already eligible receive hundred dollars. got summer lottery it. 


The fact guys waited long get hundred buckaroos makes plain sad. Guess next pandemic wait long get paid vaccination./s far one.      vaccination 100% effective?  Sure.
You say anything. People aren’t breathlessly following around Chris Rock every move. Every vaccinated celebrity announces Covid excuse idiots say don’t need get vaccinated  Yeah get many ""follow science, idiots"" ""I care (or even know antibody levels) want booster yesterday!""

While vaccinated better unvaccinated, viewpoints different sides coin.    much press coverage uses headlines mention backlog? haven’t yet seen winter restrictions schools reopening. Combine waning immunity vaccines it’s highly likely cases spike coming months. Probably much though considering many people already form protection now.

If get next spring without massive casualties finally begin assuming things control.  problem many us think Facebook YouTube constitute research. wish current passport. hope this. better yet, stay hospital  Well think vaccines really slowing Delta far transmission goes, severe outcomes great want. 

I've seen viral load data vaccines seems feed reducing severe outcomes antibodies reduced viral load data coming seems point vaccines effective reducing transmission Delta, although worked great reducing transmission original strain alpha.

Only problem don’t kill wearing one, like vaccinating, I’d advise everybody wear seatbelt. know that's legal even helpful make unvaccinated patients pay service. Vaccinated people still hospitalized COVID. think makes sense premiums go precedent (e.g. smokers often pay higher rates).      viruses never stop trying doesn’t mean always successful. variant able spread 99% tested samples delta. Must exhausting mindset “some bad new variant always round corner”. Yep, political logic going get them. identity pride.


I think need give people ramp meet us, offer face-saving rationale change position involve admitting wrong even changed position. 


Having get vaxxed keep job might work (I want to, to). Sadly, think point need see someone care suffer first. happens need cancer meds heart surgery? think lot people going unnecessarily die coming years. ask self time bad thing. Obviously family members terrible, terrible society. article clickbait bullshit. polled 1000 ""very online"" truckdrivers.  

like rest america whole, half truck drivers vaccinated.  much geographical too. live, even truck drivers skew liberal/democrat, know already vaccinated. obviously always going small group willing fired this.  mandates finally kick in, we'll see shakes out. 

the major concern coming mega carriers industry perpetually short drivers, sort extreme shortage going right due demand rebounds. 

carriers less 100 drivers (not required mandate) licking lips hoping megacarriers fire bunch drivers. 

will interesting see plays out. Mu really cirumvents vaccine, might another wave delta since current protections probably helping Mu variant spread around vaccinated people. everyone starts relax, could bump numbers again.   anti-vaxxers responsible thousands deaths point. need realize qualified research. research contradicts scientific community's results, almost certainly something wrong. got relevant PhD, probably try sway scientific community. university neurology department go sent message MS patients advising get third dose certain MS medications - Ocrevus one them.

We’ve got plenty opposite result happening. felt nothing second round, first round *rough*, indicates probably prior, despite every test coming back negative. gf tested positive last december symptoms, quarantined 2 weeks. Tested 3 times negative across board. again, ""adversary"" foreign countries turned Irish man idiot.

No one said was, victims misinformation propaganda campaigns pushed adversaries.

You said simply adversaries, that's plainly untrue. context situation Denmark:

- country gradually opening throughout summer. lead moderate increase July (when Delta hit), since numbers stable despite re-opening. past month numbers dropped significantly despite restrictions dropped. may seen final effect last restrictions getting removed (on September 10th), restrictions lifted earlier.

- Denmark one highest vaccination rates world (~75% entire population fully vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna). country initially vaccinate quick countries like Israel, US UK still fastest vaccination pace EU.

- Denmark one thorough testing regimes world. Tests free available immediately (both PCR quick-tests). Results PCR almost always available within 24 hours. Variant tracking thorough. Like countries Delta variant dominant past couple months.

- Compliance government guidelines quite good compared many countries. certainly share crazy antivaxxers, remained fairly insular tied broader political ideology.

- Full reopening includes nightlife [big now. far numbers kept going down.

Obviously herd immunity claim interpretation/opinion single scientist. clear quotes, believe claiming complete 100% herd *immunity*, 'herd immunity'-effect keeping spread virus check.

**Edit:** mean come self-congratulatory. We've made plenty mistakes there's lot polices think wrong and/or shortsighted. turns actually herd immunity effect think caught lot people surprise.   would start getting vaccinated,  asked similar question days ago. current prediction based responses wave over. same, little fever felt gross next day fine.

Welp Duh  You’re still getting it. (big if) vaccinated person gets infected yes spread viral load. likelihood getting infected significantly lower , infected recover quickly. Therefore vaccinated people much less likely spread virus. illusions Canada possible refugee country flee crumbling fast rest illusions. worries, L.A. resident I'm always check (and always use periods avoid confusion!). Tobagao = ahegao tobago   I'm talking production

You can't vaccinate 35M+ people 3 months straight without 35M+ production understanding would even come close ~16 billion doses 

Please refer already pointed topic: ""Remove children eligible vaccine dose anti-vaxxers"".

Even magically made 16 billion doses appear along billion workers administer them, administer anywhere close 16 billion doses. Nearly every country trickles vaccination doses reach ~70% total population, low production rate able sustain rate that.

So that's roughly 11 billion doses need ASAP entire world, there's roughly 5.85 billions already administered, face logistical issues countries financially procure doses: able produce enough vaccinate everyone willing able within 5 months. 

But sure, there's issue booster shots. However, Western countries already pretty significant supply doses. example, [the US 60M doses hand right [Canada 

Anyway, like said, production sufficient finish vaccinating everyone give booster shot within year. state wasn’t yet endemic wild population actually introduced illegally imported deer states escaped breeding operation Pfizer needs studies.

Could test increased dosage Reading highly reputed peer-reviewed papers like coming Nature hold accurate picture, long skilled enough decent understanding statistics.

Anti-vaxxer logic typically goes something like 25 vaccinated infections 2500 worse 20 unvaxxed infections 500 there’s vaccinated getting infected period, hopefully see obvious flaws logic one. point make conclusions fit data, don’t make data fit conclusions want get to.

The problems adults one thing. thing viruses insidious invisible complications leave strike later date. Think Zika virus women gave birth children with, it, craniomegaly? Microcephaly? Skull atresias? forget actual diagnosis malformed brains skulls fetuses fatal instances. women pregnant became infected Zika.

That's worrisome threatened fertility. Threat current life trumps threat theoretical life book. that's worms open. Good thing governor actively tried help virus. 2022 better shit together want beat this. sure serious... FDA following science vaccines; mean imply aren't. Vaccines hold charge severe infections hospitalizations, according every study. That's issue -- I'm concerned want version Covid, including ""mild"" version, FDA prioritizing prevention non-severe cases.

But FDA recommending boosters certain subset population. might want talk doctor getting one. Best luck.   probably should. say though third shot kicked ass. got shot Thursday night still running fever afternoon arm red sore. get maybe give two days recover rest. Highly transmissible variants like delta can't remain endemic given population, spread fast get chance ""circle around"". That's even true there's large portion population that's vaccinated: herd immunity reached even faster.

The potential problem constant flow mutations make previous immunity ineffective. experienced yet, since countries reached sort herd immunity. think Peru first, considering much population died it. [You see gradual curve new cases gets starting delta variant cause kind wave (unless winter wave related delta? That's seems impossibly early)

However, worldwide vaccinations picking pace, think there's real chance mutations get stymied. would need super-variant that's resistant vaccines easily infects people already virus. Otherwise, delta variant prepare enough unvaccinated people similar variant fought relatively easily.

edit: I've done bit math R0=6 75% population vaccinated 3 times, herd immunity reached ~44% population infected. happens nearly much UK *right now*.

If R0=7 everything else remaining same, herd immunity reached infected population reaches 52.6%.

Increase vaccination 80% population though, herd immunity attainable 44% population infected. Same, know I’ll sure spread it.

They idea experimental design works, near zero epistemological grounding. 34K staff, 125 refusing means 33,875 ~99.63% refuse. I’m following CDC FDA guidelines regarding boosters since concerns myocarditis risk vs reward valid imo. things mainly question decision longer collect proper infection data wanting focus hospitalizations deaths still putting things like year long brain fog “mild” category symptoms giving flying fuck it.

The scientists writing papers decisions made politicians related scientists. There’s tradeoffs everything. CDC FDA aren’t lying, omit things like base infection rate messaging nowadays want economy open quicker even people likely continue suffer long covid due decisions. I’m two shots masking quarantining due lack confidence probability long covid. sir, understand risk is? probability event outcome event irrelevant. head collision worse? COURSE. means nothing terms RISK.

Shocking. almost like full shit something. seems options might unvaxxed nurse nurse stretched followed anti vaxxer recently amazed faith folks outlandish sources. see usernames come threads many different conspiracy theories. mean, see something could lead otherwise reasonable person maybe believe Marilyn Monroe could murdered Joe Kennedy, Sr seem equal opportunity nut jobs believe all. bizarre. great job smart job. Although recall correctly distributed shots nursing homes first. owned two companies.  got high risk shots.  learned delta different thing. Probably reason they're Clinton Biden's asses, Trump's. experts agree covid stay getting rid anytime soon especially Delta.

All experts failed miserably making good projections [data scientists took matter 

Actually, going easier delta many people get hit quickly. lingering endlessly like first strain. quick spread part reason UK seeing drop cases now: *whooping* 5.4% population got 1st dose since July 1 (well, course helps, I'm sure get point). 

Keep mind infection also provides immunization person recovers, also: immune system response even better someone infected + vaccinated. already agree current full vaccination rate 65%, would take long time UK reach herd immunity. 

Assuming 90% protection infection vaccine, infection, current full vaccination rate 65% population: UK would need roughly 83% population infected reach 90% total population immunity. realistic all, agree. 

However, 90% immunity population corresponds R0 10 estimates delta variant range 5 8. Even take high value, say 7.5, math country reasonably high vaccination rate like Denmark (let's round 75%), share infections needed quite bit lower lower: 64% fact. Here's basic arithmetic:

* 75% * 64% = population near 100% immunity 48%
* 75% * 36% = population vaccine immunity 27% * 90% protection = 24.3%
* 25% * 64% = population infection immunity 16% * 90% protection = 14.4%

There it, 86.6% effective protection population. might point 64% population infected huge, far away. Well, assuming tally 135k deaths reliable, means there's roughly 27M infections far, give take couple millions. represents 40% population already infected SARS-Cov-2. So, yes, UK would still far away herd immunity even increased vaccination 75%.

But remember picked high R0. drop 6, still pretty high, we're looking 52.8% population infected reach herd immunity.

And provide booster shot gives [up 95% infection we're talking 43.9% population requires infection reach herd Israel vaccinated adults teens still seen rise.

And Israel reference why? vaccinated 6 months ago? Even UK higher vaccination rate right Long term yes sure need rest world vaccinated well. Till rest world vaccinated forget herd immunity. 

There would reintroduction SARS-Cov-2 country reached herd immunity, small pockets infections yes, new pocket would die relatively quickly. mean Africa still like 20% vaccinated countries.

Most 0% June, less 5% Morrocco big exception 15%. much better right 3.8% fully vaccinated, know what's much better? little international movement Africa.

But agree need get vaccinated hopefully deploy enough workers assist whole reason got Delta variant low vaccinations around rest world. low vaccinations across Africa etc=more possible variants.

Since delta started spreading, nearly 30% world got fully vaccinated. there's likely going another 30% end year India, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam Pakistan currently leading charge.

Along many people got infected already, rate mutations going slow dramatically. Dr. F tried tell you. didn’t follow lead that’s you. 200mcg sheeit that’s like 6 Pfizer shots.  smells like urban legend me. recall seeing post clever comebacks murdered words sub like cousin’s friends’ balls swelling think story broke. many cousins’ friends’ balls play here? disgusting. Vaxed people still die Covid. Imagine one family members seeing this.  That's tragic. I'd wondering that's critical care beds Florida becoming available.  
I live America, way handled CV crisis shit. read end title “big balls” Nicki Manaj thread. 🤦‍♂️ doesn’t necessarily become chain reaction. unvaxed spreader living high percent vaccinated area spread blunted “dead people” drastically reduced.

Moderna Pfizer essentially though really matter either way. Right bay bay! I’m trial, one US  ""Acute"" sense means single bout, opposed ""chronic"" exercise, meaning regular habitual exercise.

Both acute chronic exercise already known beneficial immune system: chronic exercise bats aside many effects aging T-cell response, along batting aside many markers aging really markers chronic inactivity: (nytimes paywalled article) Lol - people can't breathe, Alabama turns blue? I’m doctor lawyer, understanding refuse treat unvaccinated people (outside normal triage care rationing) would exposing facilities insane levels legal liability.

And besides that, thing see time time is: “it’s job judge people, it’s provide medical treatment”. can’t really argue level dedication.

I see you’re coming also. also exhausted this.  no, won’t anything  *edit: wrong below. someone messaged pointed out. 

For Pfizer Moderna least (didn't check others). **were** tested symptomatic infection alone. looks like e.g. Moderna stated 94.1% effective phase 3 CDC follow study HCW estimated around 90%. Pfizer similar based quick review. 


/End edit

Not terribly concerning regarding efficacy. course preventing infection (sterilizing immunity) holy Grail, tested metric touted severe disease death, they're effective at. extra win somewhat provide people - think recall something like 60-70% reduction risk infection. 30-40% still lot people number there's substantial community spread like now. groupings inevitable since e.g. families might share genetic risk factors course possible shared environmental exposure living together interacting frequently. 

Someone correct math: assuming truly random distribution infections testing half people vaccinated, 100k infections per day, 60-70% still expect think~23K-28K vaccinated infections per day. 

And there's bias internet life everyone tell someone know vaccinated breakthrough case, generally go we're vaccinated catch COVID week. case, I'll say I've vaccinated ~5 months caught COVID them. friends family, everyone (except one friend friend) vaccinated, know single breakthrough. definitely sucked week them- lost sense smell/taste/etc. - think dying knowledge fully recovered.  Sir, trolling? Would rather catch Covid get head collision drunk driver? you’re indifferent, suggest general population would also indifferent, guess agreed point.

Surprisingly, level infection realistic US since close 44% population already infected another 0.8-0.9% per week (which places US 60% total infected time next winter).

None people suffering deserve medical care either, could easily prevented suffering. Chile seems well tho Ah that's good point made. even think - kids vaxxed 
- vaccines what, 85% effective vs delta? that's 15% us get sick people scared shot 
- hospitals full plenty states 
- us actually want see fewer friends countrymen dead husbands still flies back city work police officer. Can’t walk “California” money.

But clearly walk away family days/weeks time 😂. Honestly I've lost form compassion/sympathy police shot I'd accept that. 

I'm tired holding back rest like ones inconvenienced. Never mind scatting kids top it. pregnant relative home ‘water birth thing’. ID state. would use ER needed. promote prenatal care? It’s receding, really. point I’m converting prayers. No, help paint picture. Good weekend vaccines means they’ve making effort, effort reflected good news cases. way, related. yes, think it’s good critical headlines... attentive, rather. interesting. work inpatient pharmacy asked pharmacists topic, said really seen legit studies it. One mention Moderna vaccine happened larger dose pfizer. also heard people got Moderna vaccine experienced side effects people got pfizer maybe offer longer lasting immunity. pfizer dose .3 milliliters Moderna .5, wonder truly amount. people vaxxed would choose vaccinated meant spread others. young healthy high risk demographic. understand argument getting vaccinated caring people, still spread argument basically this: contracted COVID yet far do, chances small would hospitalized (there 2% chance hospitalization contracting Covid, since that's adjusted age/co-morbidities, would even lower young healthy). Since could still spread even would vaccinated, see point getting vaccine know long term effects of, chances getting Covid severe enough even hospitalized low.

Even taking account riskier choice personally everyone around take vaccine. Vaccinated people less likely infect others get sick long term effects impossible.  Americans trust healthcare healthcare system America failed honestly broken system. Anti-Vaxxers problem. Anti-vaxx healthcare system lost trust. healthcare system's main priority cure, create patients treat symptoms profit. even created USAs heroin addicts due Oxycontin fiasco. Pretty shitty. add top that, Americans generally like told government. Small government ideally better country, get media government trying force health decisions throats seen government entity attempting flex totalitarian power shitty healthcare system. Americas root literally opposition government control, expect situation? people try say mandates work 

they fucking work 

Kudos Biden admin coming hard mandates Thin blue line that, fuck medical staff tho Oh damn, higher risk exposure too. last days preliminary results published studies fun. noticed edit, sorry initial response. hurting, bad.

I'm disabled, community online gaming. Many friends across globe.

Almost half gone, confirmed least 5 dead, 1 school Texas refused implement enforce mask policy there. One heart attack, suffered congenital disease, friend age (in 40s), room hospital.

The two cancer treatment complications. One died transport nearest hospital full, died lacking room, 20s.

This last year, humans choice, nothing could improved chances. caused antivaxxers maskless freaks. rest silent friends idea, could dead mourning losses, young live antivaxxer parents.

I foulmouthed auntie crew, many eSports hopefuls, others trying entertainers, one gave servers play connected fans. lives over, they're gone, cut short, ruined.

It's loss, world's loss, many servers Discord turning graveyards reasons. probably platforms, global communities shredded fucking scum. Make hard choices.

Ban even fully vaccinated people entering.

Close state borders.

Prevent People leaving.

Etc.  well well known showing tits. first time I've heard it.  US-- scheduling flu vaccination got long list others.i could ask (Walgreens website) stock I'll get tetanus booster least happen think hilarious. story stupid comments making laugh. weirdest fucking story arc year. Lol. shows screwed American healthcare is. love USA cancer would move immediately able PM name sub way find it? I'm doctor sounds useful. Thank advance. People still strokes, MIs, MVAs. Etc. guess lot Mexicans Alabama? Ivermectin popular vet supplies running out? SMH. Madness. think comment you’re responding may poorly worded.

There indeed exists gap way booster shots discussed public political discourse (considered essential) scientific debate (current vaccines holding well general population, lets boost vulnerable try vaccinate many possible worldwide).

I think it’s certainly useful highlight difference consider carefully. evil plan working. Soon populate Alabama Russian spies one ever know. stop believing science? 

When told us needed give fossil fuels.  Nothing uncalled reddit ew. uncalled Great, shit's get real expensive. Wish fuckheads would take vaccine.  sore arm feeling bit tired experienced shots.

Not everyone feel sick getting shot. 2020 study Australia showed ivermectin killed novel coronavirus laboratory. experiment, however, used doses large enough potentially fatal humans.

I guess could kill many things large enough doses First astrazeneca jab high temperature aching 2 days. Delta, actual virus August, like first astrazeneca jab x10 2 weeks. Absolutely. Family reunion probably less common way less occasion good old incest. Poor souls left alone dark.  need someone send masks? Wait telling enough uncle father r*ping indoor sisters daughters get pregnant inbreeding malformed child pandemic? failure leadership. 

It fault 100% beyond control. right reacting situation created people.

Do best put safety mental health risk failure people. unhealthy ultimately unproductive.  Hopefully breathing room holidays Happened neighbor, except first case way later feb 2020. got one vaccine getting covid, got second got COVID again, probably Delta. Far glean reading stuff UCSF infectious disease doctors saying is. vaccinated immune system actively trying find kill covid-19 viruses. converts long term immunity. difference two much head start new covid-19 infection get going immune system nukes it.

Delta infectious gets head start early strains.

The things keep mind PCR tests exquisitely sensitive. pick slightest infections. Ones may meaningful clinical public health perspective. Meaning infection asymptomatic non-infectious.

My take vaccinated worry. also avoid unvaccinated people. I'm seeing people say getting mild case covid vaccinated might dangerous quarantining pain ass.  Unfortunately (if all) countries socialized healthcare make extremely difficult (if impossible) get visa move health issues would expecting use healthcare.

I know Canada New Zealand pretty stringent.

You may want plan ahead bit serious. look like functioning? yesterday. Fuck yeah go Alabama GOOOO!!!! AMEN  all. think Dallas/Fort Worth exhibit 'Texas' people area belong are. Ask fight vaccinated patients care covid treat better. Lol. must few.

Suspicion shots grew mind Patricia Mandatori, Argentine immigrant Los Angeles, hardly felt needle going first dose Moderna vaccine March appointment.  
A day later, though, satisfaction says ""felt like truck hit me. started feel rotten says, 'Yay, got vaccination.' happy. felt relieved.""  
While symptoms show immune system responding vaccine way protect disease, evidence clinical trials showed people symptoms also protected. feel bad feel bad, experts say.  madness it.

Although saying that, still pay antigen tests travel certain countries. EXACTLY ones get free NHS, except company gets money sends us fit fly certificate.
At point mandatory money making scam. like watching light eyes darkening real time, fully knowing how, able damn thing worry, also note 15 hours may early get systemic post-vaccination symptoms mild moderate severity, occur within first three days vaccination, resolve within 1–3 days onset.   Honestly I've seen folks even die still refusing believe covid that's got them. whole thing far beyond disappointed/anger disbelief many would imagine something nefarious vaccine virus real. stop believing science? 

I work ICU, scary many friends quitting, wanting compassion person could avoided getting intubated. 17 people currently ICU, normally 12 bed room. double rooms many paralyzed/sedated vent. freaking insane guys. ONE VENTED PERSON VACCINATED.This 16 months ago. pretty dang good, 40ish people ill covid maybe March so(dates pretty hard can't remember exact time numbers pretty accurate).. 340. peak last big rush ill people topped believe 450+. Can't even help people way need we're inundated. guess.. I'll make paycheck point cleaning idiots refused medicine behind vaccine getting every freaking drug imagine. Paralytic, sedated, tube feed, rectal tube keep back side backing potentially causing blockage. Arterial line keep close eye heart, meds keep blood pressure well heart rate two usually give second, first lungs.

Woah now, that's unamerican. believe freedom Vaccines effective, would know. Breakthrough infections happen quite often, chance vaccinated person make another vaccinated person seriously ill, extremely low.

Including childhood immunizations (kids adults). also sent husband local mindwestern public health department get childhood vaccines late 20s, parents old school anti-vax he's not. (We're 40s now.) charge either. Well makes feel much better know I’m one.
Thank you. Problem is, get shitload really expensive tests diagnose cancer. Good pup. honest average Floridian probably got early . I’m making assumptions. pointing part article apparently missed. physicians believe infected vaccinated. 

I think it’s criminal predatory insurance companies hospital organizations are. Healthcare free heavily subsidized. 

But people part. masking social distancing part society need enough people vaccinated. 

Regardless didn’t do, one deserves Covid bankruptcy healthcare bills. 

But may come actually making financially difficult people order get everyone board. absolutely hate that. anti-vaxxers removed hospital. bring baby!! Israel first vaccinate many countries since caught up, 62% population fully vaccinated middle pack. US 55%, EU 63%, UK 66%.

At point countries basically boat. Delta spreading among unvaccinated ~30% eligible population can't get vaccinated. Moderna gang representing. sounds like bioterrorism... ""just go"" somewhere - place locked two weeks.

This punishable law. know yet do. knew exactly video article referring even read it. guy pressuring old man leave hospital unrelenting despite insistence literally EVERYONE room including doctor stay despite old man laboring hard breath, leaves younger man. 

If old man dies, hope Irish authorities charge younger guy equivalent manslaughter depraved indifference.  area drive-through walk-up testing. ask health insurance information required. free. Google around probably find something. Georgia chiropractors ?? Hard take seriously... one health insurance profiting. insurance fair would break even.  sure saying boosters needed ""everyone"". Maybe Reddit. CDC, FDA groups scientists around world pretty good consensus boosters needed everyone. Given 1 1000 NY inhabitant died COVID around year ago, say neither 500 380 high expecting.  Pfizer’s HD-DVD vaccines   Fuck healthcare system. wife insurance delivery baby cost $4k. fuck paying for?? think middle men would lose money. Cool, wonder 53% Pfizer compares states.  say guy driving around truck yesterday huge sign back window said “YOUR MASK ERODING FREEDOM” huge flag AR-15. 1/2 country wrong. multiple references article interviewees various states faced empty shelves. want?? able find weeks ago even though prices doubled tripled; need herd 11 shelves completely empty feed stores area too. I've heard Sodium Cyanide prevents COVID well. virus can't live already dead.  Israel first vaccinate many countries since caught up, 62% population fully vaccinated middle pack. US 55%, EU 63%, UK 66%.

Israel found decreasing protection *among elderly* started roll boosters age 65+. UK started roll 50+. They're currently evaluating younger population. FDA decided couple days ago needed younger population.

They basically saying thing. tracking gets sick via ""breakthrough"" cases primarily elderly ones getting booster shots. Everyone else risk. Much due bad Labor Day reporting caused 7 day average dive unnecessarily, spike, similar thing smaller scale week later. It’s still 11% peak September 1, something like 15 last 18 days seen daily decline cases week prior. It’s definitely plummeting steady decline. Thats husband at. dont want make babies want adopt. What’s stopping us? biggest factor finances. *Could* manage? Yea, could, dont want struggle it. many people around us pressuring us saying “you’ll never ready, kids!” 

And i’m like, terrible sentiment push people. would tell people clearly know cannot properly financially provide child CHILDREN? 

Really boggles brain. Yep, don’t believe state’s numbers. see New York added 12,000 deaths tally? group people largest medical bills…. ones gofundme campaigns lack medical insurance. 

Increased copays, won’t much impact people without insurance (taps head) people likely poor bad insurance think you’re overestimating much airlines care front line employees. instead going somewhere adults receive vaccines also defend themselves, stormed places kids get vaccines can't defend themselves. Definition cowardice stupidity right there. Regardless vaxx status? That’s fucked  Also state took away women’s reproductive rights. Bezos's makes $26 million daily nap. expect see 100% automated trucks yet. fully expect see hybrid system driver monitoring 2 3 trucks convoy drive autonomously intervene complex situation. Trucking takes bit intuition able predict drivers actions. I'm Melbourne proper fucked right now. Lockdowns, curfews, protests, overrun hospitals. works. ended getting readmitted dying. 

All people charged murder.  Good girl.  cloth diapered 2 babies happily brought world. tubes tied. know 10 women age thier tubes tied kids, thier right. People forced parents will, especially know financially irresponsible, infinite patience takes raise kid properly. 

The boomer view immature kids ridiculous. believe thats told birth control hit market older generations jealous. 

With coming climate catastrophe, kids responsible thing ill-equipped raise generation handle it.

The fucked landscape inheriting fault burden. someone explain me, Americans gullible research own? believe everything see social media. crazy. moderna. Spouse too. Neither us anything sore arm. That's wild. $100 test part US.

If they're stock job/whatever need require certified result, buy test kit $35 pharmacies. look data up, actually. found out. 53% Pfizer. administer vaccine critical care, targeting someone already really ill makes sense lmao. U.S. Registered Republicans = 65 million

Republican Anti-Vax @ 36% = 23.4 million

U.S. Horse population 3.8 million Umm sure heck am...no kids lyfe....  I’m New England right nobody wearing masks they’re crowded tiny restaurants. Meanwhile, even reddest part OC, they’re least making effort provide outdoor dining separate people, even refuse wear masks, chin diaper thing. 

If New England (currently CT) like this, don’t even want know bad South.   Brazil great! It’s nice see population strongly supporting vaccines. difference here, crazy gets like 7-8% vote. America it'd get 50 lol FWIW, already dropping COVID. [It peaked 2014, dropping since due incredibly shitty ROE health care spending. US obesity rate (3/4 Americans overweight, 2/5 obese). opioid epidemic. road accident fatality rate. 

A lot things basically results choices made leaders US 40s 50s seemed great time nasty long term consequences. now, change would piss huge segments America. really, people suburbanites terrified St. Louis City come year baseball game tell story like survived apocalypse serial killer hunting down. also saw tall building. live STL city we’re NYC, though lot cultural assets much larger city largely free it’s sad nearby skip them.  he’s Australia we’re lucky patients don’t pay since there’s Medicare Misinformation threat National Security. adversaries love spark flame see spread like wildfire.  odds climate change disastrous (close 100%), MUCH higher nuclear war ever kids 19 21 plan funerals pay dead parents’ medical bills.

Medical bills generally die deceased - people inherit parents' debt. will, however, eat estate mean inheritance. Awesome explanation I’m Ontario Canada, PM ordered lots vaccines I’ve vaccinated now. another wave virus due antivaxxers yet seems like willing assume worst justify predatory billing practices actually Arizona, Texas New Mexico now. Spring 2022 companies pre ordered automated trucks get orders. anyone explain 
1) ‘notice liability’
2) school shut down.
The article explain that. almost like state governments listened science better chose pray away problem. strange. they're gargling iodine.  Welp goes hope trans tasmen bubble aus anytime soon Jokes you, I'm sex repulsed asexual. I'm never sex let alone kids. Summary is
16-2 voted giving booster people 18-64 
18-0 voted give booster aged 65 
Also panel recommended giving people higher chance exposure like health care workers exactly it. mention small team techs nurses behind scenes every surgery. Right trauma 2 facility one maybe two surgical teams good day. means burst appendix emergency C-section show time, they're screwed.  That's perfectly fine adults 18 over. Let make choices.  Best = Profit$$$$$ Republicans die, thunderous...a mostly preventable death.   too, I'm burnt work, way treated employers. can't imagine must people get there. Remember begining pandemic people actually drinking bleach   took 10 days get insurance authorization appointment MRI another 10 days get follow appt. review results ortho. Granted Covid could work gave back work chit follow up. Thing is, even surge region. I'm sorry, sounds rough. Thank mentioning kids. kids 12 infuriates people community help protect them. Take care internet stranger. think people vulnerable others, cult influence. I’m surprised insurance companies covering anything Covid person isn’t vaccinated. Think 🐎 people! 

This animal cruelty.  also none, except arm little bit sore day, think it‘s needles  Nice, kid fever several days, sent back school without testing. get fined live.  ""Horse owners can't find Ivermectin *IDIOTS* flock unproven coronavirus cure."" There, fixed it. ""Although unvaccinated constitute 17 percent Israelis eligible vaccine, account around two thirds active serious cases Israel moment. contrast, fully vaccinated patients make 7.5 percent serious cases."" ain't gettin changing diapers.

But got tubes tied? Boomers gotta love em’ gay person takes it, make person gay straight? Yeah, true. find case interesting similarities people anti vax smallpox people covid vaccine. Also, dicta explaining freedom liberty spot imho Looking news sure seems way COVID. We're going run Greek letters end year. understand flu greater genetic diversity though immunity transfer well strain strain, might play COVID's herd immunity favor. Wow that’s crazy. average Canadian stays ICU 50k CDN. happy anti-natalism definition heavily selected \_against\_ darwinian standpoint.

Single generation ideology future. world belong plentiful.

Also think world horrible good reason kids, check places life actually horrible, quickly become aware also places people kids.

The real reason people kids want grow responsible adults. Instead want prolong hedonic childish playtime forever. ""If kids much fuuuun boohoo"". kind stuff. consequence luxurious first world living, people living comfortable lives want give up. N N   Wtf? Chiropractors arent even real doctors. Like even let touch neck go, fucked can't anything hurt me.    Relax. wife, daughters shots reactions. son law flu like experience. Reactions differ. I've heard anyone extended family group friends serious issues. mean fair guy couldnt get vaccine back Covid history triggering conditions making worse..   misinformation highest degree mention booster trial antibody test previously done initial administration. closest they've school while.  Well, got changing diapers kids. know imply people end kids anyway. husband successful, children, mid forties extremely happy never change diaper. friends same. 

Contrary state, keep kids.  denmark extremely good track trace system corona high testing, actually highest rate world, schools still get shut many get infected. Uk here: shift Democrats florida? antibody test  expect? hospital takes medicare/medicaid *has* this. I'm ok idiots getting COVID punishment enough selfish stupidity. want see bankrupted. imagine nuts they'll then?! 

To clear; *cost* million dollars keep someone intubated week. even close... that's *charge*. Especially Uncle Sam paying. Eh, one could argue, dicks belong vaginas, that's evolved. get point article says doctors think infected vaccinated. possibly wasn’t careful. possibly wasn’t going vaccinate felt sick thought would help. don’t know.  Dude clearly dense fuck.   Every unvaxxed and/or anti-mask conservative Orange County:

“I didn’t shit worked!”

Or 

“Told it’d go away”

Or

“My favorite businesses local sheriffs told newsom’s economy killing lockdown measures pound sand, look, we’re ahead.” Yes. one. hospital burn overworked understaffed theres many dying. Hopefully latest delta surge burns  1-Our goverment corrupt fuck people understandably wary decision make zero trust them.

2- oh boy conspiracy theories, amount insane conspiracy theories jordan produces make america shy shame, fact border israeli bad history help, seen people legitimately claim vaccinations israeli conspiracy wipe despite fact Israel first vaccinate.

3- large child population unemployment, 40% population 18, age group hardest vaccinate. government passed mandate businesses, goverment workers, teachers, college students, gyms theaters, must vaccinated, unfortunately 40 percent population 18 high unemployment rate almost 1/3, cover large chunk population. infact people age groups 18-60 5 million remove unemployment 3.5 million, number people managed vaccinate.

Our real hope fully vaccinating country go full gulf countries style implement vaccine mandate school students one want enter restaurants cafe supermarkets. Fortunately many people goverment starting realize that. True, looked 400 hospital mid July basically 7day average 42 cases.

Seems like good conservative approach low case loads, unmanageable opening Delta current vaccine efficacy. Buh bye, ignorant knuckle draggers.   whole infrastructure way outdated, every time visit Europe feel like went future. look fucking airports lol current spike Covid cases, Singapore 1/3 infected people hospitals according [this analysis hospitalisation rate always high.

They barely weeks substantial amount cases. Sort of… ur blood expected antigens present purified monoclonal antibody.

It’s actually long-standing anti viral treatment research communities (I covered time university part course content). Animal hospital may smart prescribe label human. /s  knew math major college lots statistics classes . college took different jobs. making high six figures health insurance company. Exactly! love anti vax friends saying SEE HOSPITAL BIDEN PAY !! wont able keep OPEN!!

Meanwhile sit asking percentage workers realize small 125 36,000 is, get much response. many times going see SMALL MINORITY big mouths they'll shut go away? forget effect 'bachelor villages' due Chinese cultural preference male child exist China many places female born 30+ years. Except statistics show getting changing diapers. would suggest flagging article clickbait vaccine misinformation following reasons:

1. article pushes narrative Sinovac ""does work"" antibodies generated Regina Ip's system. However, actually produce antibodies shortly administration hence issue antibody decay rather vaccine facilitating antibody production. article HK01 (local news) mentioned crucial detail conveniently omitted HKFP  Regina Ip mentioned Facebook took first Sinovac shot Feb 22, second shot May 28. time, antibody level 182.6, within acceptable limit. However, blood test week showed negative antibody, indicates antibody.  title article sensational. taking BioNtech part volunteer program getting 3rd booster shot. becoming common across world.

3. HKFP highly partisan news source. nowhere bad RT Fox, articles generally lack neutrality would easily break ""Avoid politics"" rule. OP also demonstrated thread highly partisan. may ask, what's main reason behind hesitancy there? rural hospitals near border shut down. take constant bleed across border government step help. wife works insurance usually poor citizen qualify something. Single young men though bad poor. Single moms usually get something. Older usually get help. young men bad like able to.do much though sometimes took write-offs. can't day long pay bills, staff , etc. much insurance actually pay. billed amount actually paid. One democratic states country low COVID rates? Oh GoSh gUyS, i'M sHoCkEd.  boomer anecdote real birth/death statistics, based facts reality.. know, boomers hate reject facts reality dont validate opinions worldview Fortunately live bigger metro area. going get mri day unless emergency. doctors request mri , blood work etc. Usually covid easy enough. walk everything MRI advanced testing. schedule online phone testing. actually smooth year work kinks quicker walk in. Usually get done week sometimes day building schedule mri blood work building two different offices. Doctor gets results quick usually online access everything either phone call already appointment set discuss results. learning ever system thrown using best possible. R 1   Exactly, people modicum society. media loves report crap like hence rest society exposed it. like, personally afford. Yeah want wait another 4 years Mr OJ.   agree. Many countries free college/university. enough tell US likes care citizens.   older health issues. try pick plan even higher straight deducible possible say 80/20 split plan. hoping employer variety plans chosen needs. US relying employers for.heqlth insurance sometimes screwed. Employers may offer bare minimum fault for.not better employer. /s  got condition tested positive covid condition triggered viral infections.   Yeah, seems like protection severe disease, hospitalization death remain high foreseeable future, due B- T-cells. decline antibodies allow breakthrough infections thus increased viral circulation. 

But (hypothetic) 100% vaxxed population, nobody (or people) get severely ill, acceptable. 65-80% vaxxed/immunized population, viral cirulation represent burden healthcare system might reach unacceptable levels. Thus, 3rd doses (dramatically) increase antibody levels might help.

&amp;#x200B;

But 3rd dose applied broader population, richer nations start sharing poorer ones reduce suffering death virus. Meme black guy pointing temple. schools require masks social distancing. Son high school shot. elementary street young. See playing close together outside masks. supposed official case reports weekly average like 7 cases 650 students. saying good expected higher. know lots exposed last year not. close together recess hardly masks including teachers thinking would higher least first. yeah stay home 2 years safe /s reddest part OC, they’re least making effort provide outdoor dining separate people

It’s true they’re providing door dining literally zero effort maintain 6 ft indoor dining wide open maskless months. California’s lucky someone who’s red area CA works darkest red areas, trust say we’re getting lucky west coast younger man get first place?? first time saw video thought doctor thought odd wearing mask. bought bunch last summer inlaws started preaching cure. (We horse)

Then sent us care package Kenya amongst things guess......blister packs ivermectin. told wife hide kids could find it.    Yep, that's one Real talk.

According Christians don’t faith Jesus heart, saved.

Should easy Vaccines, don’t physical condition issue preventing it, refusing faith Vaccines blood, don’t get salvation via treatment.

GTFOH - go home, shove Ivermectin bum die. 

It’s rediculous people dying due beds ,people vaccinated issues unrelated covid, simply cause bio terrorist cromagnums taking resources.

Selfish little dick terrorists! Naw, signal phone interferes microchips vaccine true Medicare. flu pneumococcal covered. course Covid vaccine free everyone. Whats nr 3? Severely immunocompromised people able get third shot months US. must opening little wide. idea healthcare works cannot believe blaming doctors, including ones family, crisis. many ignorant things comment; emotional energy explain reasons hypothetical solutions would work real world real adults trying save lives. fair, murdered arrested homeless people. live CA, family live seem think he's supposed Yeah think HIRING signs like said excuse run skeleton crew.  even Democrats.  saw video. man looked scared. waste. know someone works equestrian supply wholesaler, hard time getting fulfill orders tack shops. can't imagine needing medication real disease able get bunch bone heads think cure something completely different. could convince nutballs put stickers message drug packages. 

Get super stickers can't removed. make excellent point: human often things healthy. weigh amount satisfaction certain unhealthy choices lives decide whether pleasure outweighs possible detrimental side effects. opinion, humans never infallible invalidate right medical treatment.

The vaccine different story, though. world-wide pandemic, science proved/is proving vaccine best means getting control. can't look around, say, ""You know...I want virus keep killing vaccine, perfect, ginormous way slowing down. I'll part get it. since really big deal, I'll also wear mask around others maybe get sick.""  That's it. That's I'm arguing for. 

I'm pretty peaceful gal. teach vaccinated wear mask want students get sick want 85 year old mom get sick son congenital heart defect. forget that...it's me. US society. Let's help other. zoos vaccinating animals? vulnerable people world vaccinated already? based, context, agreement thinking they're going overboard? can't tell. local feedstore large signs advertising stock sell looking. *cries Texas* Yeah. Saving lots lives record budget surpluses. what's hate, right? really normalized wishing people die? 

Many people responsible illnesses due obesity, tobacco, alcohol unhealthy choices. Maybe let die, cheer go. (large) hospital work 10% RTs quit past MONTH. Jesus. world live in. Ha. real though, I’d hate set precedent!    agree poor countries struggle access vaccine receiving excess doses, human beings responsible animals kept zoos. Many animals susceptible COVID endangered worse part global repopulation programs. Letting potentially die crippled COVID infection counter that.

Considering sheer amount anti-maskers saw zoo refused wear mask around monkeys big cats, animals really need vaccinated. example, went zoo masks required ""unless medical exemption"" AKA ""If wearing mask press surely medical issue"". BUT, zoo signs saying masks absolutely required matter around outdoor monkey big cat exhibits. Well, nobody respected obviously. animals need vaccinated. wish deployed schools night life.   Americans, reporting normal people taking vaccine living life normal boring. Crazy anti vaxxers eatign dewormer paste horses easier sell people buying newspaper. Yeah. don’t begrudge people anger. worry folks starting believe us intelligence consequently lose sight people’s humanity. Especially think believing aren’t susceptible cults makes susceptible them.    see call actors, still partially obscured, mannequins. accuse healthcare workers giving treatment actually works. Etc etc etc etc on, forever. We're point anti-vaxxers ""rescuing"" patients hospitals (as that's they're starting do, now) might finally frees hospital beds. Biggest opportunity increase vaccinations Brilliant. Love post.   Maybe put mandatory warning them:

WARNING: PRODUCT PRODUCED HUMAN FETAL CELL EXPERIMENTATION Biviral recommend checking People desperate often take risks increase spread. 5g chemtrails makes frogs gay! 🤣🤣🤣 Thanks, appreciate would hard get data US due decentralized method reporting. However, recent [report UK give data. 

* Breakthrough deaths average age 84, slightly higher average age Covid deaths, 84
* 76.6% breakthrough deaths clinically extremely vulnerable, 63.4% limited long-term health problem disability
* 13.1% breakthrough deaths immunocompromised, much higher 5.4% Covid deaths immunocompromised   I've said replies, can't mock someone got horribly injured car accident wear seatbelt got thrown thru windshield. Would seriously hurt worn seatbelt? Probably not. risks involved wearing seatbelt well known? Absolutely. can't look person hospital mock call dumbass. would suspect someone made post said ""my 20 year old cousin riding car friends got bad accident. wearing seatbelt legs got badly injured thrown car might never walk again, might even live point. taking hospital bed someone may unpreventable illness, even feel bad dies think dumbass"", everyone would think horrible unfeeling monster. scenario risk putting seatbelt. risk getting vaccine, however small. endometriosis surgery delayed far 18 months. stage 4, it’s progressive, taking organs. began, going need bowel resection. don’t know organs attached, last month hospital twice kidney infections Yes, think it’s less people people cult’s vector attack. cult got 6 months messy break struggling deal ptsd. also joined broader online community members cult part of. cult leader promising techniques would cure ptsd, point desperate ideas.

It’s like abusive romantic partner honestly. find group, make friends, trust them, make feel really important special… far enough problems start happening. case started trying pry away friends family (to make dependent socialization), ultimately failed chose prioritize family even convinced cult wrong thing unreasonable. external social group might still cult. crucially they’re charge husband going wedding 2 weeks basically guests except 10 vaccinated. I’ve getting anxious draws closer, got J&amp;J vaccine RSVPed summer, things little better COVID! got JJ early March feel like fairly protected vast majority folks vaccinated, can’t shake jitters!  sucks, yeah. I'm glad they're removed positions put lot people risk. breaking news.

Anti-vaxxers yet another stupid thing risks someone else's life. read electric surgery Excellent plan!  Get vaccinated get Covid. hospitalized Covid live....you're broke.

I vaccinated also got Covid. Although enter hospital, I'm still recovering.  antibody tests trusted purposes? thought weren’t reliable.  2021   It’s different vaccine one used humans, made especially animals. vaccinating human vaccine stock supplies.

Even using traditional vaccine, still needs done. species virus filter through, likely mutate potent form. benefits us vaccinate animals close contact humans beings. think states well - aren’t already vaccinated you’re probably going be. Flat earthwormers! That's 1% hospital system I'm in. be. Yep, one family anything “feeling meh day two”. Despite hella environmental allergies, none us ever mildest reaction flu shots, tetanus boosters, etc., maybe there’s genetic component it, idk.  ""dat one dere Tokyo doctor said works"" - Dr. Joseph Rogan, PhD don’t kids, I’m getting older time. point changing diapers. Damn… right.  none minor shot barring slightly sore arm. One tried tell mom top emitting COVID since mom vaccinated phone would kill spoke 5 minutes. literally can’t make crazy. partner got really lucky. house 8 (including us), vaccinated Moderna Pfizer tested negative didn’t get sick even though 6 extremely ill. Yeah I’m seeing sea masks anywhere New England, nobody masked stores crowded restaurants, except store staff even they’re chin diaper thing. wish pics. CA, scene different expect see cases continue go CA, here.

You question throw stats want, upon viewing behavior here, expect see New England see cases rise. Bingo. I’m sorry, what? fail understand logic. That’s am. don’t want partner I’ll even though known high risk factors. Would rather safe sorry. hate US healthcare system much, good insurance work. I’m guessing large portion unvaccinated uninsured underinsured. going bad. Jesus Christ, they’re fucking horses health now. piss poor defense. Ugh Report state medical board. It’s enough medical degree. Doctors licensed well, medical board strip away. called pharmacy today said unless you’re immune compromised aren’t giving booster. Mind I’m PA, results may vary. Hard know people really thinking people come believe vaccines completely ineffective protection disappears 6 months see point vaccination program. instead want everyone go back lives let virus run natural course.

I think people making informed decision given all-over-the-place communication vaccines virus kind understandable people think way. They've told many different ways problems vaccine 6 months ""abundance caution"" CDC can't say something simple like, vaccine protection lasts longer 6 months. believe basically true US well. Anyone poor medicaid. Anyone poor money ""required"" (very soft penalty $2k not, honestly super worth healthy person skip) corporate insurance (which required cover child wellness) ACA, ie Obamacare, really hole safety net me.

I think real hole poor immigrants access US social net, US historically many immigrants Europe/Canada, which, view, represents conscious trade US greater economic dynamism (because immigration) exchange weaker social safety net. cases: Freedom both. 700 people city 5 million...  think also point point freeway. another truck finishes it. Maybe they’re using American English; took place Ireland, believe. think people misunderstanding me. I'm saying removed cause harm... That's also 125 fewer people already understaffed field.

I'm allowed think right course action remove them, regretting came this, worried down-line repercussions ill. get remove hospital like wished others ?

Should respect man last wishes Unexpected Error: Empathy critically low levels mean, they're antivaxxers taking extremely sick man hospital, question answers    think early that. still sure long immunity lasts vaccines. Especially going actual flu season seems like worst time thinking moving sentinel system. would think would wait got winter season given happened last year. thing clouds actual data field. much coveted bed gave up. shouldn’t admitted again. choice leave first place.  MS many years ago, good drug certainly helped. Yes, statistically risk still low.  Canada?

Because Russia fucking us too. adversaries, even though we're recognized world-wide leader peace. emergency surgery asked leave 8 hours later without even seeing doctor post surgery beds. scary. I'm area decent vax rates. Yup. west coast fared best. even covid shambles. imagine much worse coulda been. data shows, pretty obvious think it. paper suggests chance severe disease vaccinated people breakthrough infection unvaccinated people, know comorbidities increase risk unvaccinated individuals: mean, already one going burn quick Delta much transmissible.   Italian dipshit behind works infamous Irish dipshit that's managed American dipshit handler. idiots gone global too. see comments like time German Cain awards. claim vent killing them. frank, vents often associated secondary infections, thing is, know finally put lack oxygen likely kill worry another infection.

My fear one crazy antivaxers going act beliefs get violent hospital staff.

Edit: Autocorrect making sorts unintended associations l.ll let stand record internet. hate German homies. We'll moving sentinel system like flu certain people areas tested, extrapolated get idea overall transmission like variants circulation.

Eventually larger negative effect benefit society testing. think we're still bit away point here, much need track every single case since we're accepting circulate community. CVS? Yes, get attacked occasionally. do, paranoid ""adversaries"" tend help much. Iraq attacked US, full-on security state little them.

But we're talking Iraq, we're talking Ireland. country could conceivably attack UK, did, Ireland would stand chance.

So no, Ireland ""adversaries"".   Every single week millions people sit inside close quarters church sing hug shake hands eat together. Football games easy photograph spread happening churches. problem taking care itself. 99% people history worse lot children dont worry Yeah, I'd love cocid denier's would never visit hospital. mean, believe doctors terms covid, would believe diseases? Blah blah. Israeli data shows older vaccinated people hospitalized higher rate younger non-vaccinated people. boosters, started July brought total end that. Prior boosters decline effectiveness doubling month.

What waning Covid-19 vaccine immunity means people unnecessarily dying. need boat load numbers understand that. smell politics again.  n95 can. ok. even hospital without masks? security? science deniers, sure trying prove darwinism.  30% breakthrough rate. Everyone gives lottery tickets virus. There’s stopping it’s mutation.  died now, BTW. removed sooner might alive today! /s Another CDC study week showed 18% COVID cases, 14% hospitalizations, 16% deaths, occurring fully vaccinated people. substantial increase 5%-8% infection, hospitalization, death rates seen two months before. additional real-world evidence diminishing vaccine Using previous standard measuring prevention symptomatic infection, clinical observations Israel found effectiveness Pfizer vaccine declines 41% 5 6 months, even lower 16% 7 months.

The FDA's politically guided decision lead continued death suffering could prevented. Israel canary we're ignoring hubris misguided virtue.  Good bot believe they're either known other, swim similar circles.

I'm sorry still bad are. point comfortable saying insist keeping pandemic alive taking precautions murderers. could variant coming vaccine resistant. Thank spelling me. read it, felt like knew known already lol. nice breakdown, think fully understand able remember it. Without masks?! WTF, stupid? covid vaccine proven help prevent covid I've known 3 people died covid last month Georgia. know one person icu currently. unvaccinated. think stupid still sad.  I'm tired 'put notice' wack jobs. thoroughly American feel terrible Irish brethren.

It terrible 2 weeks, worst illness I've ever had, sense smell took almost another 2 weeks come back. coughing fits month after.

I got second Pfizer shot May tested positive COVID friends (they're vaccinated way) started feeling sick mid-August. assume Delta.

My one friend's co-worker apparently complaining ""having cold,"" still came work gave everyone. friend mask people vaccinated care wear one.

I self-quarantined 2 weeks safe, really seriously sick 3-4 days. still bit coughing week after.

EDIT: wanted add that, anyone vaccine, vaccine, Delta probably would killed last month. extremely transmissible Delta variant coronavirus, overtook variants United States months ago, represents 99 percent cases tracked country, according data Centers Disease Control variant caused caseloads surge Britain India spring summer, countries outbreaks resurfaced cases seemed decline. Delta variant fueling outbreaks United States throughout summer, contagiousness taking advantage number people resisted Covid-19 data Delta’s prevalence, contained C.D.C.’s latest biweekly report virus sequencing, shows climbing quarter cases mid-June near total dominance unexpected, it’s transmissible, also strong reminder need continuous vigilance,” said Dr. Saskia Popescu, epidemiologist assistant professor George Mason C.D.C.’s COVID Data Tracker, reporting results two-week period ending Sept. 11, put B.1.617.2 lineage Delta 99.4 percent among variants concern, two Delta lineages tracked 0.2 percent 0.1 percent, Mu variant — first detected January Colombia — 0.1 percent several other, unidentified variants 0.2 percent. data based thousands sequences provided every week C.D.C.’s national genomic surveillance efforts, according agency’s country recently experienced rise hospitalizations, despite availability highly protective vaccines, Delta variant cited seeing children hospital Delta variant readily transmissible among everybody, adults children,” Dr. Anthony S.

Popescu said rise Delta help Americans health officials realize coronavirus remains serious public health biggest piece is, ‘Don’t let guard down.’ need continuous surveillance, genomic sequencing, access testing public health interventions,” Dr. Popescu wearing masks help, transmission occurring limited exposure, means that, example, times without mask, around others, become much risk,” Dr. Popescu said.

Hospitals overrun everywhere. Australians fortunate comparison. no, antivax man went hospital family. left, returned hospital couldnt handle covid home. saying countries go around world attacking countries never get attacked countries do? Interesting theory, wonder holds tiniest bit scrutiny... I've heard multiple times too. priority needs getting first 2 doses unvaxed. Except happening lowering options people want something think still many words complex concepts intended people. make drawing crayon using dinosaurs WWE characters? would kidding you? That's literally data Pfizer file EUA booster. mention Israel administered 3 million well documented booster shots point. don’t understand people think trying kill keep seeking care? mean, happens time still don’t understand it. patients diagnosed HiV keep coming clinic despite refusing take meds think poison, don’t think virus real, think created government kill gay men, don’t think it’s big deal fine drinking aloe juice (or whatever) make strong enough fight off. think there’s layer rationality denial, still doesn’t make sense me. Someone need stop fuckin idiots. Real human lifes line people actually kill people stupidity. Everyone entilted opinion course free speach, line crossed humans die.

It makes really angry patience exhausted.  never understand say heart attack something they'd immediately flock hospital looking doctor moment comes doctor telling take vaccine anything involving covid suddenly think know better damn shame Ignorance, period. boomer generation viewed major reason problems US world.

Not problem...my horse worth extra $12 me. people claim can't get it....agendas. many people saying that. Literally one backed claim. tested positive (and tested positive antibodies many times that), would weird get live home. really got 2021 also tested negative many times test positive (but lost taste smell, oxygen Sat dropped 94-95, high fever many symptoms). father severe ICU case 2021 also tested negative many times. flu symptoms 2020 mom infected. I’ve NEVER understood they’re totally willing “new flu” avoid restrictions lives. flu sucks, spreading flu sucks, already flu something enables another one.

This “it’s flu” shit infuriating suggests fine getting sick don’t to. idiotic. old guy told doctors needed put medically induced coma intubated. scared texted family friends saying want that.

Israel found decreasing protection among elderly started roll boosters age 65+. UK started roll 50+. They're currently evaluating younger population. FDA decided couple days ago needed younger population.

They basically saying thing. tracking gets sick via ""breakthrough"" cases primarily elderly ones getting booster shots. Everyone else risk.

Additionally....

Israel struggling high cases Delta evidence be, gave booster doses vaccinated. Here's good discussion state data boosters data points against, mostly observational data results affected factors too..

And remember adult vaccine schedules ""if booster given soon, apply another dose"". indications data waning connected shorter gap, especially 3 week gap Pfizer, enough solid analysis, might emerge countries need early boosters, might boosters good 12 months 2nd shot everywhere, something else. data emerging now, information say wide booster programs would net positive.

Calm tits, everyone. are? lost compassion 2 months in. Why? left free will. 

Fuck them. remember Conan Brien joked this, reality:   
  -- horse worms pharmacy everything except COVID vaccines. 
  Worrying? It’s literally happening right now. Breakthrough case=being infected body fighting virus easily. It’s bad thing. vaccinated drastically lower risk you’ll spread others though. doesn’t protect like you’re saying, provides lowered chance spread disease others well (since body much higher chance clobber disease viral load gets high enough spread others). important part people vaccine, means every time virus tries jump two people get chance fail due vaccine. people mean talk herd immunity, close everyone vaccinated virus won’t get anywhere jump protection every time tries move hosts.

If medical reason, sure makes sense. friends need realize it’s binary “can can’t spread others.” It’s set possible outcomes, friend’s desire get vaccinated still increase odds spreading disease someone else.

(Practically, think US absolutely enforced trademarks mRNA vaccines instead helped nations build manufacturing capacity aggressively possible. aggressively shipped vaccines overseas vaccination rates waned here. that’s neither there, control.)

Anecdotally—I got J&amp;J shot, made decision (after talking w/my spouse &amp; several doctors, made clear weren’t giving medical advice said it’s they’d probably position) get booster Moderna w/o FDA approval it, didn’t like foot-dragging done around lack tracing breakthrough cases booster research. reasoning was—I’d probably survive COVID-19 J&amp;J alone board, getting extra shot reduces chance /vector/ others and/or developing serious breakthrough case, that’s net good community (and me). short—I decided ethical imperative “more vaccinated people” (which can’t affect getting booster, doses going unused area) outweighed theoretical reducing likelihood spread COVID-19 (and primary harm choice would likely fall primarily instead others). However, decision &amp; certainly can’t say it’s completely supported level science FDA usually uses make decisions. seen per capita numbers per week? numbers found overall pandemic. Americans! :D

Thanks. know people get vaccinated drives bonkers. guess banking idea get ""that"" sick....which crazy me. I've thought asking, I'm sure handle conversation strongly pro-vaccine find anti-vaxxers obnoxious.  0.31% state died, they’re losing 0.01% week. Canary coal mine. Community norms/ policy determines death rates. They’re pretty much bottom every metric. It’s lack leadership slaughter crucial time. unvaccinated people, particularly reasonably young unlikely (but certain not) severe enough symptoms need hospitalization urgent medical attention. range symptoms symptoms easily chalked stress/allergies/air pollution like extreme fatigue high fevers couple weeks. Absolutely. Teachers medium-high risk group we're asking huge exposure risk. teachers get booster school year starts.

Of course, prioritize last spring. see society would start caring now.

Just go get booster already. Darwin right. likelihood getting covid passing someone hotel double vaxxed plus booster plus masked nil. risk never lower—even 10 years now. There’s story here. Kind chuffed getting downvoted people sense humor.  Well, apostrophe used informally demonstrate omitted letters apart standard contractions.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Pitter patter. I’d rather get booster (like Wednesday) shot actually go someone’s arm versus thrown like we’ve doing. I’d love US sending it’s excess vaccines overseas, we’re that. changes zero qualms feel best me. Fully vaxxed probably won’t happen, unless allows medical exemptions  die

Citation please feelings care facts.  big Hawaii then? influenza killing people rate COVID is

I understand logic/ethics. death deadly viruses problem death rate COVID-19? 

Hundreds thousands hospitalized tens thousands die every year influenza ([CDC hospitals overflowing

Just 3 years ago, hospitals overflowed influenza cases would also support flu mandate.

Why CDC mandated then? Year year, somehow find way justify running pedestrians car claim freedom still horrible murderer do.

Then let's make logic clear: saying getting vaccinated murder?

Edit: Also, please mention edit comment new information. would able reply points better so.  Maybe he's Sith?  ""largest land area"" ""largest state"" two different things, fyi unless lakes become sovereign territories didnt notice can't get mastectomy, brain surgery, whatever cancer, ICU full covid patients, think absolutely reasonable count pandemic loss. mention suffering people could treated something stage 1 instead fighting stage 3... 

Then there's people suffering healthcare worker shortage/burnout. People steady non emergency labor can't get bed giving birth 43 weeks instead 40... Etc. know tell them?? like seatbelts. 100% save life chances alot better one without. tamper w ur immune systems overall ability defend countless ambient pathogens

Lolwut? This. data, country. child home. vaccine given billions times now. unlike Ivermectin somewhere around 5 million people probably boosters fine. said would blow faces. didn't. Cases never exceeded 19/07 UK. I.e. opened _lower_ cases did.

I care NL. bolster chances lower. 

I think is. Show research myocarditis fully vaccinated individuals covid. got 1 dose J&amp;J. feel little differently getting early compared someone got 2 shots Moderna pfizer first time around. I’d like get full protection mrna, specifically Moderna feel like I’m level protection majority instead stuck 1 dose crappiest one hope it’s already. danger, think it’s worth tradeoff lasting long would waited. always go 6 months worst case.  I’m amazed didn’t go far enough fight you. could easily said spewing fake data.   don’t trust Israel’s health data

Then look data coming UK differs degree points direction. 

Somewhere 5-7 months post vaccination, effectiveness drops fairly significant amount. Yes, vaccines still effective preventing infection extremely effective preventing hospitalization death. real drop categories.

If want argue hospitalization death prevention primary goal, explicit that. also explicit change direction earlier year goal much prevention infection. Decreased effectiveness preventing infection means reduced effectiveness preventing SPREAD well. also Long Covid issues mild moderate infections, solely severe infections.  Yes, helps body fight it, magical force field.
It stop entering body.

Do need instructions breath every morning, level stupid insane? people taking ivermectin, one tell tide pods actual cleaning solution got 2 Pfizer JJ. whimper. know of. rural area got hit hardest state. sucks. hope horses okay. bugs idiots even trying get docs give human version, going straight horse dosage.  hospitalized? not, shot working intended. Check paperwork. supposed prevent infection. That's ""nice have"" lasts titer high. vaccines designed proven testing prevent severe illness death. wife got Jansen got covid. nasty cold week, asymptomatic. vaccine effective mrna ones, still reduced severity recovery time gotten vaccinated first place.

Edit: know he's little now, hopefully help near future That’s immune system works theory. body sees something know fight - that’s vaccines work. virus mutate could get sick that’s long shot. early know. Everyone thought spring early summer cases dropping rapidly along came Delta point, anything happen. say stop giving unvaxxed free medical care end Corona horse paste poisoning… That's like asking put nutritional information covid vaccines fight obesity. could prevent hundreds thousands deaths heart disease social distancing course would it. 

What understand argument get nothing let vrus spread death toll would much higher loss life crowding hospitals (which leads unnecessary loss life, people without covid) significant cost well.  Well ofc, countries relax. Netherlands close again, because, well, blew faces Imagine student 100 years now, trying avoid mixing facts heard history class Monty Python sketches saw arts calls. Yeah, fuck that. give single fuck family. suck balls. I'll get booster sometime next weeks. I'll sure mail pic ""I got vaccinated"" button know suck it. influenza killing people rate COVID hospitals overflowing influenza rate COVID is. were, would also support flu mandate. living flu pandemic.

No, decisions reasonable equivalent. somehow find way justify running pedestrians car claim freedom still horrible murderer do.

Getting vaccinated supported science helps literally everyone including yourself. getting vaccinated supported science killing everyone INCLUDING yourself. stupid around. pretend two equivalent things disingenuous.


I still highly doubt vaxxed. vested interest reality denier, worse, enabler. don’t believe so. know one concerns medial friends based vaccine side effects. example current vaccine still effective preventing death hospitalization quite good preventing infection. let’s say get booster get myocarditis.

On initial vaccination benefit far ways risk. booster might case. don’t know need studies it. 

I believe benefits still outweigh risks I’m getting mine figure dosing timelines. Also shot hasn’t approved booster. 
Georgia

Of states entirely east Mississippi River, Georgia is **largest land area**.
...
Georgia (U.S. state)
Area• Total59,425 sq mi 

Land 57,906 sq mi (149,976 k) Sheer idiocy. horse dies sick PETA em. 😁 two fanatical groups going it. note, like 3 different oral antiviral drugs tested COVID patients expected apply EUA October December. could greatly impact fall surge environment shortage monoclonal antibodies. question is: people take them? think ultimately answer is: depends message comes from. seatbelt reduces chances accident severe. Rock pulls through- should- vaccine still works. Yeah like guy entertainment industry anything people relying him. lay low abdicate responsibilities days right? could people seeing data Israel, experts US, protection afforded authorized vaccines diminish time. 

Most objections booster shots rich countries moral.  totally get this. didn’t think CA good job exactly wrote. New England supposedly great job (which decided vacation here) it’s kinda crazy even less CA (except Irvine maybe parts Bay Area) don’t understand numbers, percentages, vaccine could extremely effective population yet people still get ill.  confident I'd way worse vaccinated. seven+ days symptoms shut room worst it, I'm grateful. signage stating safe approved take together (flu covid, different covid shots) got similar “not medical advice” I’ve seen threads Dr. clients mine “find way get moderna” figured I’d ready defend reasons, find another location, play dumb. still 2% mortality US, waaay 0.1% constantly spouted.

TBF, deniers better math, they'd likely different views. true, time. delta happened. say thank God hit delta get to. many people die worldwide year? know you...

In 2019 58.4 million people died worldwide. 58.4 million 8 billion. death meme? call conspiracy small percentage people allegedly succumbing year? bet old, overweight underlying health conditions too.

If 15 million figure even close true, massive excess worldwide deaths. Heard talking Wal-Mart today. masks, covering cough, repeating media making big deal isn’t bc “still able go work”. Dramatization key *all media point, one side right one wrong. Bold take chances everyone else wrong listening authorities. fine x countries already authorised boosters go ahead get authority authorised it. firmly believe following authorities country live authorities another. There's reason country approval body. FDA incompetent know they're trust authorise boosters feel need one. logic stip 3 go fourth shot fifth shot? 

Also important remember US using different vaccines Israel. IIRC Israel used pfizer. US using pfizer, moderna J&amp;J. Also neither medical experts none us advising someone getting booster shot. shall find Wednesday report back remember. I'm worried US supply. people US dont give shit, needs made available everyone else. Please tell particular supply chain works. Yeah seemed low too. 40 8 hour day means 12 minutes each. half dose Moderna still active vaccine load full dose Pfizer. Thank you, probably put list parentheses, non-clickers, I’ll fix it. honestly get R strategy here.

* Provide counter policy supporters
* lose supporters opposing party
* Win seats? White House never come pushed boosters specific date. probably needed sure when. delta last major wave see become part flu shot.

I think end day don’t know. know don’t trust Israel’s health data - it’s country back pedal initial waning vaccine claim. 

The issue even Israel - despite boosters - worst wave infection driven by, unvaccinated. Handing shots people want help sure it’s problem it’s people without choose them. also believe due heavy heavy lockdowns acquired immunities less places. 

I mindset pump every extra dose get arms around world. smaller host population less likely mutation. wear seatbelt, got car accident still got hurt? Umkay 

A seatbelt HELP save life doesn’t mean people wear survive severe accident.

No one said vaccine 100% full proof. definitely proven keep covid symptoms life threatening it’s worth getting reason alone. Ok. obviously troll asking this. I'll indulge, sunday. virus kills relatively ""small"" number victims. full hospital beds, ICUs, overloaded burned hospital staff scenarios played many times almost every area / country hit pandemic? matter small death rate is, uncontrolled spread eventually fill break healthcare systems even developed countries. want? Full ICUs / hospitals doctors / nurses unable treat anyone effectively burn / lack resources? willing finance rapid expansion health care system deal pandemic business usual manner? No? shut up, let grown ups handle it. Moderna booster may lot off, especially since initial Moderna induced immunity seems persist much longer Pfizer’s, likely part due significantly larger vaccine load dose (almost 3x much active material). arguments boosters based supply timing.

I even mind upfront basing decision prioritizing initial shots poor countries boosters wealthy countries. There's fairness argument there, even potentially epidemiological one regarding result lower spread. instead they're obfuscating trying claim ""the science shows boosters really needed"" fact data show all.

I also think would make sense stop talking ""boosters"" instead frame simply third shot series. would mean admitting two shots spaced 3-4 weeks apart never optimal (but likely best compromise could made given situation time). Good bot. Rest sub likes him, think he's okay. He's definitely ""bad"". gonna fucking chaos. already tell divided experts boosters everyone gonna say thing. Imagine happened Alzheimers drug times ten. service industry wild. Cheers bruv!  say Irvine really place see lot masks everywhere else super wide open. people wearing masks probably 30%. work south OC masking 0. 

Tbf workplace still mask mandate public much less didn’t answer defending others choosing willful ignorance, then?

Because, now, right make personal choice regarding body COVID-19 vaccine. chosen take it, chosen take it. support decisions, seems reasonable, no? I’m opinion 7 states responsible consuming 70% doses 

For people click article 7 states ""Alabama, Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana"". wish looked doses per capita, fact california new york says lot. already dealt one those, Rock's tweet this. Thought honestly asking questions vaccines &amp; breakthrus, &amp; best answer them, started raving ivermectin &amp; big pharma conspiring hide effectiveness. went 'welp, bye'.  Weird, post auto-removed incivility. Let's try again

This happen overdose Vomiting, blindness, diarrhea, hypotension, dizziness, ataxia, seizures, coma, even death. recall, essentially melts lining intestines, gives diarrhea shit out, results wicked case sepsis top damage. Dying covid ivermectin poisoning like middle two trains smashing one another. feel worse previously known possible blind throughout it, unable see loved ones say hurried goodbyes. Add things like covid also give things like hypotension, vomiting, diarrhea, bad fucking time. wrecked immune system going handle well.

I post link since making auto-mod freakout. wondering too. Yep that's combo. ever boosters I'm definitely getting Moderna third. Pfizer Moderna Moderna go south county time would said maskless nightmare there. I’ve driving around Connecticut Rhode Island (currently sitting Newport, RI) can’t believe this, it’s worse here. 

Granted usually Irvine I’m used high level masked populace. even red areas, you’ll least see one two people. New England. good thing they’re hostile mask wearers though. can’t even imagine screamed ripped face like videos.  makes sense, rub two brain cells together understand all. show vaccine card asked write third line? work? Oh please. Vaccines hesitancy rooted (extremely valid) mistrust medical establishment completely understandable black people shamed that, (clearly relatively affluent) people *BEAT* innocent person didn’t like rule person required enforce. behavior consistent others share particular set ideologies. shocking that’s case here. Don’t draw false equivalencies hesitancy *violence*. It’s incredibly offensive everyone involved. defending others choosing wilful ignorance, then? doubts vaccinated.

It ""a personal choice"" excuse. personal choice believe go school work believe sky purple, make correct. interesting. That's situation too, exactly (J&amp;J April) &amp; need go get flu shot soon. Maybe ask pharmacist booster? say vaccine, monoclonal treatment? (With exceptions want vaccine immunocompromised, etc.)  Man thankfully heart disease contagious would suck. lot dumb people don’t understand nuance deal black/white absolutes. influenza vaccine makes good person

I never said makes good/bad person. irrelevant. said was, now, personal vaccinated?

I am.  Yes, outcome likely much better J&amp;J without vaccine. Yes good sized box ""treatments"" Covid-19 used there. claim reason much better us states.

I'm worried taking needed treatments Kenya. give tens millions dollars year help many places places.

I think crazy smart well cultured still choose believe vac spike poison killer health news... Site propaganda. one arguments anti-vaxxers.

""It's like flu!""

""So you... want flu?""

""I live fear!""

""How... getting medication 'living fear'? make least bit sense?"" good read, made easily understandable Basically like high-risk infants RSV, Synagis.    German Cain? talks FDA securing emergency authorization Regen-Cov PrEP. protocol would probably entail monthly injections; cocktail’s half-life approximately long. Unvaccinated immunocompromised individuals already allowed follow protocol FDA’s PEP authorization, provided live work institutional setting, nursing home prison, ongoing coronavirus exposure plans apply authorization fall prophylactic antibody cocktail – one might provide long 12 months protection. company contingent agreements US government provide 700,000 doses. think want covid mild flu promised, doesn’t happen it’s ravaging body, realize SOL options promising

Exactly this. want COVID mild, isn't. want bow ""liberal"" science point. Cool, didn’t know breaking labor union then. I’ll check thanks things getting dangerous. Early pandemic group people stormed Mexican hospital “free” patients since believed hospital killing harvest organs blaming covid. type conspiracy theory becomes popular US it’s matter time someone shoots hospital. Amazing! We’re almost there!

Right biggest problem unvaccinated clogging hospitals effectively preventing access legitimately need care.

I hope trend anti-vaxxers removing Covid patients morphs trend avoiding hospitals altogether — rest society pretty much move on. ACIP also meet next week? read article? idea regular periodic injections keep levels high immunocompromised patients. Come kill hero sound like schools shutting down, they'll going ""lock down"". sounds pretty similar way schools US time now.  Basically they'll keeping doors locked people can't wander without appointment.

No idea notice liability though.  people labeled anti-vaxxers? Sounds like they're anti-medicalcare. Anti-vaxxers anti-medicalcare; they're anti-vax.

Safety would society value peoples' feelings lies safety.  terrible article makes common mistake interpreting efficacy, claiming 77% efficacy vs hospitalization means one-quarter infected get severe case. No. 77% fewer people compared unvaccinated (and also excluding post-infection unvaccinated, maybe?) get severe case; number far, far lower 23% vaccinated people.

Anyway, efficacy numbers look pretty great, especially moderna. me, FDA decision boosters basically okay, especially anyone wants easily claim severe condition get one anyway.  assume don’t follow climate science. future become ugly.

So far I've lucky breakthrough case though friend mine back July. Early 40s severe asthma/epilepsy fortunately pretty mild since he's fully vaccinated. asthma pretty bad imagine would much worse vaccinated. know people recently went got Pfizer vaccine J&amp;J shot March. told first vaccination. I’m pretty sure you’re supposed that, though.   Pfizer 30uG Moderna 100uG I'm Ocrevus (2nd shot Pfizer May, got infusion June), thinking may worth getting booster Oct/Nov (my next infusion Dec). doc's office took blood samples mount immune response. get titer numbers, ""yes made them"" time fine me, since think 1/5th patients Ocrevus making antibodies.   Oof, sucks. try convince people vaccinate? COVID goes around puts wife healthcare workers risk, think it’s everyone’s responsibility everything vector virus. [Next time there's proof vaccines  fair doubting said. go work sick? mean teachers go sick time. stay home kids sick. would work sick too.  would take felt good enjoy day off. course pre covid. hope changed. mindset got us mess start with. Working sick. got third Moderna shot without difficulty. went CVS Target simply asked immune compromised immune suppressed. didn’t ask prove anything. felt pretty much third shot second, although think got better faster. Anyway, that’s experience. problems all. don’t know they’d give Moderna Pfizer before, I’m sure ask. remember really wanting Pfizer. work said moderna. happy it. remember wondering big fuss moderna. I'm thrilled turns even better. mean, could believe stock prices took dip. made sense all.

Wtf going on? incidence speedy natural selection happens time time.  vaccine success story happens omit vaccination. could possibly go wrong?    think ""can"" lot work here. sure never paid dime kid vaccination ever assume pretty typical corporate insurance plan. general, preventative checkups vaccines free, driven law insurance companies' interest risk reduction.  Pfizer’s effectiveness still high, wears higher rate.

Over 5 month period test, overall effectiveness preventing hospitalization was: 93%, 88%, 71% Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J respectively.

To me, means boosters probably approved Pfizer Moderna. celebrity without consumers. need examine and/or around us pay attention celebrity nonsense. Minaj platform without them. record pedophile brother rapist husband? fuck kinda dystopia found in? Regarding balls question feel it’s important establish know know it. balls covered up! genuinely thought would walked 8 months ago. pandemic showed much shit willing take, society learned: lot.

Gross. Thanks informing me. may due amount time, staffing, room needed patient. asthmatic teen infusion, hospital 3 hours. nurse meet us outside escort us afterward ensure one else got elevator us. treatment taken pharmacy freezer patient registered vitals taken. took 30 minutes thaw wait pharmacy bring up. infusion took 20 minutes. wait 1 hour case adverse reactions. nurse stay us entire time room could leave entered. know people vaxxed would choose vaccinated meant spread others. young healthy high risk demographic. understand argument getting vaccinated caring people, still spread vaccinated.

Their argument basically this: contracted COVID yet far do, chances small would hospitalized (there 2% chance hospitalization contracting Covid, since that's adjusted age/co-morbidities, would even lower young healthy). Since could still spread even would vaccinated, see point getting vaccine know long term effects of, chances getting Covid severe enough even hospitalized low.

I great argument that. that, call traitors murderers.

I know people whose reason vaccinated government put something vaccine kill everyone gets two years. conspiracy crap. stuff pisses totally different others reasoning listed above.

And side note, medical reason getting vaccinated (my doctor advised wait get agrees study issue), parents vaccinated. family anti-vax. Alabama’s got covered. agree. Honestly comparisons really dumb emotional manipulation. Stick facts, comparisons aren’t going convince people get vaccinated. it’s causing hatred among people instead understanding working towards goal together better health everyone bad situation. reason people distrust vaccine emotional manipulation since used political piece election instead bluntly approaching pandemic, let’s work together. Covid first started saw good humanity come out. since vaccine people extremely hateful towards other.  last human: ""Muh rights"" ""cough cough"" ""AAAAck."" real world often better Onion. typed, realized shouldn’t dissuade donating. Sorry gave impression.

The reason I’m making clear distinction largely Regeneron treatment antivaxxers getting get ill, which, based objections vaccine, hypocritical.

Good kind blood donation! leading promising donate  certainly assume hope so, haha.

But remember can’t prove negative. amount confidence/assumptions satisfy people. got shot early on. got mine January warning wasn’t added June. Can't blame them. one deal things they're dealing with. 

I know several coworkers arent vaccinated there's loke 2 us af work still wearing masks. call offs becausw they're sick roller coaster next weeks  Every single person know age 65 retired last year, people plans work 70 later SSA boost. None want get Covid, since it’s shown absolutely destroys older people. don’t know people don’t see this.  Add people died, parents deal kids, people risk factors, suddenly makes sense. disease remain, sure, vaccine mandates schools travel, circulate far lower level, overwhelm hospital system. end pandemic. Think like Antarctica. Oh, ok. still think might it, get needle phobia control long enough go donate.  Fair enough, historical context. done research this, no? anyone got J&amp;J vaccine March/April/May went ahead got Pfizer Moderna vaccine booster, 65, immunocompromised, high risk?

I got J&amp;J March work public setting full time Im concerned getting Delta powers debate need boosters general population. Im 37/F. No, that’s called convalescent plasma. effective cloned antibodies. Go Team SpikeVax! checked balls swollen could even confirm existence balls? can't even imagine stress. hope things get better say, personal experience, COVID sickest ever life. never want go something like again, want anyone else go it.

Only thing mandates came cities Massachusetts, federal government. We're talking people can't get it, free everywhere USA, we're talking people choosing risk lives people denying it. I’m concerned time period study jumbled Alpha Delta together include Delta all. gotta get info behavior specifically Delta vaccines.

Also brain fog isn’t part 12 listed symptoms get around 20% self reported rate symptomatic infections that’s something well. acknowledge it’s unlikely 3% number go significantly even brain fog listed symptom. So, let get straight:

The FDA Advisory Board believes there's evidence boosters anyone immunocompromised, 65 older, high risk.

In Israel, started vaccinations early, like did, space doses much, like did. they're struggling Delta. 60% vaccinated, apparently? 50% fully vaccinated, roughly 70% one dose. So, situation pretty similar ours. even can't vaccinate 12 yet, like us.

So....how evidence boosters gonna needed everyone? experts divided this? reason, seems like bunch scientists knew shit inexplicably extremely boosters. reason they're afraid happen boosters made available everyone.

Would like get both, idk wait certain amount time vaccinations, get together etc. I’m due booster November (fall high risk category) it’s sticking 8 months. Pfizer even allowed Alabama? went kind fast couple things caught attention. says save lives nursing homes vaccination. Given 40% Covid deaths occurred nursing homes sounds pretty unbelievable me.

On average person admitted nursing home 3 serious health conditions (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia, etc) lives less year. Another way say 1-2% nursing home residents die every day. die getting vaccine coincidence i.e. correlation causation.

He said rate fatality vaccination 411 100,000 yet 40% covid fatalities nursing homes, see conclude vaccine protect people.

He also said myocarditis happen 1 1000 cases. Studies shown 100-150 per million range. myocarditis always fatal, condition treated etc.

If bringing spirit things FDA look committing booster program everyone makes sense -- drawing conclusions raising concerns. purpose FDA review etc.  necessarily. next delta-like one. surprised people think vaccines actually do. saw comment Instagram shunning covid vaccine since""it cure anyway"". 🤦 Pulling someone hospital vaccine?? think anti-vaxxers mutated deadlier strain.

Do people new england mask possible? guess think people mask (properly, nose, mouth, chin) possible, vaccinated people able dine-in, etc. (where masking possible) want over.

I also question means, nature exponential growth means cases explode back today masking/distancing stops without adequate population level immunity. get immunity vaccinations infections. ""Russian flu"" (also coronavirus) spread unchecked late 1890s, took ~3 years resulted large amount death. Today, vaccines option, people refuse them, willing accept getting immunity infection means get immunity. preferable masking, etc. forever (which would additional immunity). bring shunning upon themselves.

... long face? Logic. remember reading studies beginning much less likely get infected? goal posts definitely moved. strategies change due circumstances changing. know would wear quickly. still can't say ""it never intended prevent infection"" that's insisted us studied beginning.

It weeks ago report deaths, cases. updated original post links. Seriously, someone finish typing realize ""Whoa, went far authoritarian nightmare territory there."" It’s Americans.

The arguments boosters based supply timing. We're 50-100 days worldwide excess vaccine doses. We're several months away Americans 6-month mark since second dose. we'd really like use time get data, since research far limited (but overwhelmingly positive). course, none mentioned FDA advisory meeting saw; arguments booster mostly driven anti-vax propaganda (""lies"").

Well here’s trail anti vaxxers scream “HE GOT VACCINATED STILL GOT IT, IT’S USELESS, IT’S SHAM”. 😒 wouldn’t anything help them, think would help weed unvaccinated taking medical resources. ones beyond hope would refuse go home. I’m beyond done people.  Today mom said would cool kids relief tbh

It seems basically cruel bring child onto planet that's literally going flames Stick guns. time travel, esp den unvaccinated. feed horse properly keep healthy clean environment, get wormy. since deleted too. know many people aged 40-55 went ICU, 3 died.

Most long term issues could considered physically disabled. logic, take 10? 1000? WHOs guidance largely lead becoming pandemic. Forgive caring opinion anymore. Clearly dosing enough waiting years every human planet get vaccine winning strategy. Throw money building manufacturing regionally past global vaccination programs did. Get single shot vaccines developing nations that's fastest path logistically obvious. can't sit around act like need boosters data says do.

Edit: I've clarified meant dosing regimen, meaning number times need shot. Moderna vs Pfizer though indicates individual doses Pfizer / duration shots effecting longevity disease prevention. Given trial lengths, there's reason believe need adjustments along way. unexpected calling additional doses booster may turn simply number would hand gotten along given longer development cycle.   [He's said.... make sure wear 4 masks face shield goggles US throw away expired vaccines people would get it, lets go there, foolish. helping people overseas getting vaccine. US's best interest heart. got JnJ, believe go get two dose vaccine (Moderna Pfizer) would. Regardless whether US sending vaccines overseas, truth NOT, vaccines currently produced wasted US. someone -- government someone else -- steps billions required buy excess distribute overseas, far better use boosters. heterologous studies given good results. pfizer/moderna though they're essentially vaccine different dosages, question whether larger smaller booster better. Moderna's trialing half-dose booster much closer pfizer's shot size.

In particular, though, Canada gave around 1/4 population moderna booster regardless first dose got, since got 7M one-week shipment moderna wanted get shots arms. worked.

In short, probably matter. Pfizer's probably ""better"" younger people many side effects before. probably knew room wasnt far one entrance. rest family could caused raucous rushed room staff waiting security. tweet deleted guess unconfirmed report worst fake.  wonder whether variant may able evade vaccine-induced immunity (such Mu), also able evade immunity comes getting sick another variant. Anyone info this? Brazilian. Rio 1 203 almost happened dad, taking hydroxychloroquine cool.

Thankfully doctor saw way winds blowing upped prescription crush came. Mr Hands happy news hit save realized best choice words, honestly think anything else conveyed feelings quite well.

I talking woman tail end last year vaccines available. husband treated cancer time. telling high stress level addition covid worry about. telling often starting run unmasked people stores go to.

It got point started ordering groceries, whatever else could, delivery. told pharmacy offers free delivery. there's emergency type, pharmacists go fill prescription middle night deliver it. told going immediately change prescriptions them.

As someone who's husband terminal cancer 2018, can't imagine anxiety levels woman, others situation, going through. know high anxiety trying keep husband safe communicable ""things"" sick.

About 3 months husband died, big outbreak chicken pox area. started local private, religious school allowed parents opt vaccinations kids religious exemptions. started wearing disposable gloves rare occasions go store time. People looked like bat shit crazy. care one bit. I'd like crazy woman washing hands every 5 minutes got home. I'd take shower, change clothes ... pretty unhinged.

I think day goes think of, worry people even though vaccinated, weakened enough probably survive breakthrough infection. truly come point despise anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. I'm U.S. south pretty much surrounded area. 1 couple know vaxxed take everything seriously, often bend ears outrage want talk anymore?

Ooof ... I'm sorry long rant. Since husband died, I'm pretty much own. kids, family members left 1000 miles away. Although masked vaxxed, watch news prefer live state ""ignorance bliss"". really anyone talk , really needed get chest. read this, thank much listening. :) actually feel better getting chest. vaccines precautions taking. areas, taking lot less risks due Delta, going much, using masks on. think anyone knows answer question there's one thing I've learned pandemic matter bad things are, always find way get worse article hours old.

* Joe McCarron ventilator Letterkenny hospital showing signs recovery.   “fixed” CA since 2006? far tell, things become exponentially worse. Uncontrolled fires, near worst education country students, water shortages, homeless ever before…   like ""pro liberal democracy"" ""pro science"". fair, makes sort easier reason two parties. really nuance left. original wildtype virus alpha variant less infectious vaccines seem effective. Big smooth thought got covid pummeled friends house. We're early mid 20s vaccinated. course none dying even sent hospital nasty enough turn back live like normal immunity runs out. I've vomited puked blood I'm one here, absolutely miserable week, luckily worst past (not yet others got later). Since go hospital, guess count 'mild' cases, comparison respirators, mislead people sneezing that's it. variant detected 99% U.S. cases, according C.D.C.

And people still refuse believe evolution real. die.

He die. [This article three hours old mentions he's still Joe McCarron ventilator Letterkenny hospital showing signs recovery.

The [reddit originally stated died since deleted too.  Well that’s likely experts expect Covid endemic, it’ll never really go away. said also won’t like last two years hell Covid burning completely unprotected human population never exposed virus before. worry, they'll onto next ridiculous unproven cure long. There's already reports ""gargling iodine"" prevent COVID maybe there's oncoming iodine shortage. 

Meanwhile timeline full dead COVID victims morning. One lived next door &amp; well-known around town. mom three, otherwise young &amp; healthy. Shit's far beyond hand IDK anymore. Even vaccinated liberals masking like be. Interestingly, data one far less clear much expensive complicated treatment. comparison, Covid booster complete no-brainer.  much due US's aggressive screening regimen treatment cancers unlikely fatal though? There's chance may better wait booster different manufacturer, certainly opportunity cost associated making decision soon. Maybe it’s stupid question but: 99% Delta, mean we’d basically done COVID without Delta?   Imagine explain job interview. Imagine talk medical expertise conversation explain this. people think employer 'get it' use reason hire someone else, IMO rude awakening ahead them. it? last country attacked Ireland, Switzerland, Sweden? many people countries remember war? people allowed walk around hospital without masks? MODERNA CREW RAISE HANDS mutated “vaccine bad” “all modern medicine bad.” Anti-vaxxers? Irresponsible??? *shocked pikachu face* sad part many even stupid misguided even sad. think they're careful waiting see vaccine harmful. loud idiots pushing anti vaccine anti mask propaganda morons disdain for. Big difference taking parasite medication primarily given horses additional dose vaccine specifically made protect thing trying prevent already said additional 3rd dose okay large population older individuals high risk occupations  Thank you. 

Even everything open tomorrow, would least 6 months surgeons able coordinate calendars, cancer patients come first. Thanks correction. term trying recall narrow results. Still turn relevant results; deaths reporting worked, gotta sift bit. Plenty young healthy people ICU's. JFC that's naive useless idealism.  Lol Florida 65% infected now. recent wave, 40%. time half Florida vaccinated, estimate roughly 30% population unvaccinated caught yet. recent wave adds another 25% catching covid, almost entirely unvaccinated people. leaves 5% population left.

Obviously error bars estimates, reality Florida rapidly approaching point everyone either vaccinated caught covid.  sure bro I’m guy reddit. would prob get plan do. clearly murder attempt man died. patient ill, idiots wanted remove hospital? exec's quarterly bonus. expecting paying for? ATM real citizens America wasted life death  Can... read supply issue plain ol' vaccine denial? There's chance raised others stupid. Anecdotal but, five women family are/were teachers. Two “were” category said would go back teaching “in heartbeat” (because love it) could teach remotely. don’t feel safe going 100% unvaccinated student body grandkids/kids also unvaccinated. prioritizing families health passion. people die hospitals... coincidence? think we've found key eternal life.  mean, believe may take drastic action deal ultimately. But… I’m illusions might mean. know, right? why, even though I'm target demographic vote universal healthcare, vote candidates support every time. country much combined wealth have, average citizen worry single medical incident dooming lifetime poverty.   dumb shits.  anyone else confused: town US country. That’s good hear! agnostic lean bit toward atheist 😁. also feel - pity (maybe empathy?) caught believing fed talking heads. get side well though, humanities sake better snap things could get worse 😬. family members basically plugged religious/conservative networks it’s heartbreaking watch angry &amp; detached they’ve become years ☹️.  anti-vaxxers anti-medicine, good luck that. Oh, please. believe everything believe.

More like $50K, depending specifics. Maybe he's fully vaccinated? know animals zoo are. anti-vax, anti-mask problem sorting out.  people shot get sick dude? Someone designed cardboard hospital bed folds cheap coffin cremation burial...very efficient run compassion, fatigue.

Basically saying ready die need rather get vaccinated wear mask. reality is, he’s ready die. words tell making assumption either ever become infected, does, won’t bad. knew would become infected die, would certainly stop nearest drug store get vaccinated. 

Once people realize lazy assumption terribly wrong, suddenly see light. don’t think “this happen me” does. real evil shows don’t care happens people. wrg,idts dog risk getting Covid? knew big thing start pandemic.

Several people anecdotally told meant might've covid already pretty sure didn't. I'm pretty sure that's happening right now, extent. be.

 People believe they're going go hospital doctors going kill them, ventilators going kill them. spend another week home suffering, either die home, go hospital can't breathe, effectively way late anything. Yes no. I’m wishing death every antivaxxer, time I’m kicking willfully unvaccinated ventilators someone else needs it.

It's good vaccine rollout

[Every Breath Take: Need Learn Breathe take deep breath (rhymes “death”) need breathe (rhymes “leave”). entirely different words. couldn’t get “family” family. know every hospital different made back far considering what’s going on. say “drunk driving” implied talking risk serious injury death, risk getting DUI ticket crossing double yellow line. compare risk serious injury death drunk driving COVID IMPLYING risk serious injury death drunk driving comparable COVID. knew that.  people decide get vaccinated assessed risk low go hospital. Tough home.
They thought immune system enough, keep trusting it. can't speak happening Canada, conservatives literally became pro-covid (anti-mask, anti-anything-that-prevents-covid) moment revealed minorities getting hit harder disease. Thx 🙂  
I remember that. seemed like something science fiction. CDC says ""Increases AFM cases occurred 2014, 2016, 2018 U.S.,"" mention 2018 also Asking real questions!!! Ribs scrumptious.smoked rack beef rack pork. Vaccines take time work guess help. Particularly way COVID kills you...I hope people suffering much, know people means slowly suffocating. “America” like saying “Earth”. hundreds jurisdictions inside “America” aren’t contributing 2000 per day vaccinated high rate. Breakthrough infections Moderna recipients something order 162 per ~14,000 people 6 months vaccination. Tough get much chain reaction break 1% potential hosts. 

If chain reaction happening choice made population area. blame governments areas, suppose, reacting populations threatening throw don’t comply. Again, can’t get inside people’s heads, is. 

So back point thread, highly vaccinated area feel much safer around people inexplicably unvaccinated drunk driver. aren’t thing shouldn’t comported sake flashy headline. infuriates younger guy likely go ""see told hospitals kill people"" without realizing outlier broke camel's back Infections matter long covid. asymptomatic symptomatic infections lead it. tired experts ignoring issue. Electric knee jerk?  legit reporting source ? Cause anything coming FL suspect af. I'm getting electric knee implant Article lacks detail bet confirm covid actual test afterwards since that's pretty much illness kind around right now, works.

I curious accuracy holds mix flu cold mix. right comparing others unvaccinated wearing seatbelts. patriotism, freedom rights 9000%. Take that!!

/s can't vaccinate patients entry? Would combined immune response vaccine virus kill them? Conservative talk media infested it.

Local guys biggest blame largest share hosts dying covid tell everywhere huge bleeds stuff like Joe Rogan's podcast. help purchase it? That's premeditated means. clearly need to, may want to, look definition using again, particularly pertains legal definitions specific. follow thru it...
And flock hospital summoning prayer warriors not... Clogging bed spitting nurses &amp; doctors.

These toddlers left curb rot It’s recommended get flu shot end October. I’d get separately year. Hm, interesting. know black people, minorities, less likely white people get vaccinated. affected opinion this? Please pet horse me. haven’t seen one since 2019.    well said  always has. vote healthcare brown people might get healthcare.  Yes. someone vaccinated gets crap beaten virus, imagine aftermath without protection. personal choice endangers people flies empirical data personal choice makes good person, personal choice allowed civil society. vaccinated?

If believe medical science, go cave get sick. That's worst case. EVERYTHING medicine risk/benefit analysis. Giving someone booster dose benefit worth it. There's risks!

Yes, they're quite tiny, even tiny risk worth little benefit. things anyone making decisions weigh.

They also need weigh data see much give, far apart give maximize protection, etc.

With said, heck Fauci saying data still weeks away boosters FDA advisory board already voted boosters anyone age 65? making decision without data too? Fauci lying? I'm confused here.

EDIT: looking things, appeared FDA ruled pfizer needing booster... media really made clear. So... nevermind last paragraph. Sorry! forget chem trails. State-sponsored poisoning Earth happening eyes. one verifies anything. Hell, got first dose didn’t even verify age. I’m going recommend anything anyone I’m making informed decision based reading multiple studies Pfizer, I’m medical professional. idiot doesn’t want get Covid much time hands.  Cool, that's fine.


That answers original question. Unproven makes sound like could possible treatment needs research find out. It’s not. proved nothing help COVID. Useless. severe side effects instead. know vaccines safe effective, overwhelming majority doctors scientists support vaccination.   


Group 1) ""We getting vaccine!"" 


We also emerging data boosters needed, safe, effective. Several high level scientist NIH recommending boosters. FDA cleared third doses immunocompromised cleared doses virtually half US population, including people qualified booster job. 


Group 2) I'm category get boosters yet, want ensure I'm protected get one early. 


They same, all. stupid comparison. Given pissed FDA director looked Friday's meeting, explicitly mentioned FDA actually go along Advisory Board decided, honestly surprise something like ends happening.

Hell, divided people boosters, I'm fully expecting someone - actual FDA, CDC, maybe Biden - approve boosters everyone. imagine chaos result. Depends site go to. tech get. Chris Rock vaccine, covid19 anyways, yet urging everyone get vaccine? umkay

Shots fired.

I downvoted oblivion yesterday criticizing recommendation based factors like vaccine equity rather science. What's interesting one two dissenting votes came Dr Peter Marks head CBER FDA, group actually decides booster. choose completely ignore Friday's recommendation approve booster all. Actually surprise that, would second time FDA done far year (first Alzheimer drug). could virus spiky part, immune system detect virus attack first. S1 (non spiky) outside way disguise.   Unvaccinated people screwing people animals now, huh? Nobody taking prescription medications “just because.” Moderna first one left mild body aches chills 24 hours. second one gave fever 102°F horrible body aches 48 hours. sickest 5 years (100% worth though). similar thing happened aunt confirmed case Covid last year. parents Moderna well. mom slight fever first shot zero effects second. dad experience symptoms either dose. 

Thankfully, one thing common we've healthy since getting vaxxed, doubt showing symptoms much efficacy. worry it.   JnJ shot least effective vaccines safe **effective**.

These two statements contradictory. anything nonsequitor deceptive strawmanning. Eat alot hot wings drink alot alcohol. finally crossed paths one whackadoodles wild earlier today twitter.

Circa March 2020) also agree people ready headlines stop use talking points.

And yes, developed world needs hire effing PR management firms advertising firms get message vaccines. I'm actually amazed yet. Get celebrities going, get tik tok trends going. Whatever do, frankly far I've seen government commercials boring radio spots far best.  think that's ""unproven cure"" like ""definitely fake cure"" them, sure, them. Mine regularly refers patients doctors physical therapy gets referrals things actually helped chiropractor, like actual muscle related spine issue. know plenty chiropractors entirely minds, I've see one 3 different places I've lived back health nothing else. usual, one side dragged kicking screaming progress other.  clear real possibility

Yes, everyone paying attention knew possible! Officials never said otherwise either. (and, no-plans-for-boosters accurate enough)

However, ""possible"" ""certain"". Timeline also critical: booster every 6 months much different you-just-need-a-3rd-vaccination. officials stress things could happen? ""possible"" things: virus quickly mutating avoid vaccines or, far worse, mutating vaccines trigger ADE? virus becoming much deadlier... really end possible scenarios, must stop beyond real possibility now. 

Even now, still much uncertain. Moderna seems perform better, Pfitzer UK seems perform better Israel. Timing still air.

Even article says: """"The English study suggests immunity could waning older groups much – – among age reminds ""you need mask"" debacle beginning pandemic.

That was, indeed, unexcusable screw-up. clearly wrong guidance (and hindsight either ""wrongness"" clear time) That's question. vote scientific reasons armchair psychologists looking global supply issues neither responsibility expertise?  powerful country planet ffs... “Cure” cure

Seems like Reddit filled craziest anecdotal statistical anomalies lol. That's fair. maybe squabble fiscal meltdowns myriad issues caused overall see point. ""We States, now?"" - *op, probably* Thats exactly im talking lol Definitely possibility ""Breathe"" joined language 1200, proper English. That’s really frustrating  I’m 20s, cancer decade ago, would harder emigrate places would hadn’t cancer? “Breath” “breathe” used differently U.K. vs America. It’s same. two words different meanings never interchangeable. find interesting, Malcolm Gladwell episode last season podcast “Revisionist History” taking advantage dogs natural abilities detecting coronavirus interesting. always hear cops dangerous profession world (not true) supposedly excuses shitty violent behavior often endangers innocent people, leading anti-vaxxers marches demonstrations.. wtf? afraid thing killing bunch them.. they'll shoot anyone holding something hand might gun? Fuck people. Look what’s indisputably true: number people die hospitals year insane amount. Still trust modern medicine kill harmless illnesses like STD got Trinidad? I’m glad happy let older vaccinated people die needlessly, stick greedy drug manufacturers. 

Good you!!! don’t think he’s US. might different laws they’re from. pretty good article general, especially differentiating immunity infection immunity disease. headline is, usual, misleading. Immunity infection wanes. usual, whoever disputing appears agenda nothing individual patient's concerns, need perfectly transparent, unbiased communication.

Immunity infection wanes. disappear, indisputably wanes. Wanes perfectly accurate word it. 

People require get infected need know take appropriate measures: whether means monitor antibodies boost, avoid high-risk contacts want take chances implicit course action, controlled studies behind it, course never will. established standard care veterinarians high risk rabies.

Someday might established regular covid boosters certain intervals administered safely, point titers necessary, booster cheaper blood test, proven safe matter often given, certain intervals. established standard care elderly tetanus.

There simply enough safety information available national regulatory bodies make decision favor population-level boosters yet. remove preventive rationale behind them, is, simply, immunity wanes. way guys baseline oxygen saturation 98%.... probably taking sheer amount physical effort sustain normal reading throughout day. breathe, constantly focusing breathing out... well u start fucking die. Even low saturation cognitive function starts decline. Hard make decisions, start making mistakes, forgetting shit, people operating heavy machinery, getting cars driving around public, trying crunch important numbers job, old man make decision leave hospital can't even focus beyond breathing. Israel 80% vaccinated(Pfizer) 12 yrs over, yet still seeing high daily cases(\~8000 daily new cases)? kind side effects afraid of, exactly?  Age idiots Mess  Anecdotally, didn’t know anything said dumb shit everyone pointing diversion. Bad move that’s going for.     One dumbass understand highly suspicious afraid spike proteins generated cells post-vaccine, relieved effective treatment involve spike protein. entirely inconsistent reaction.

But refused antibody treatment since refused vaccine, IMO. Tit tat. life-saving treatments reserved vaccinated only. believe Florida's governor, unvaccinated using fully half antibody doses alotted Florida. needs consequences unvaccinated, vaccinated dying lack antibody treatments, unacceptable.  People fine told depending who's saying them. death rate 2% absurd high average. would say... nothing ordinary. market alright, call free. Yeah northeast SC here. School starts things get control. One person works 6 kids. Son brings home high school runs entire family. work 3 weeks. None vaccinated.  title lol wrong? Yeah. county ones surrounding range low 30s high 40s% fully vaccinated. zoo tiger died right beginning pandemic. may more. Canada whole yes.

Not even, [Denmark 5% higher Canada total population that's fully Yeah, guess government's new ""you need wear masks"" approve wide first vulnerable get boosters upcoming stay-inside season. still limited supply everyone fully vaccinated wanted boosters right away jsut get could see big supply problem. certain percentage group vaccinated look approve booster widely groups.

Probably popular take recent denial recommend boosters, eh much trust government point? clearly clue what’s currently happening United States. 102 fever, muscle pain, slept full day. Felt fine day of, horrible next day, generally fine day that. people die hard anti vaxxers think they're causing harm. Seriously someone know claiming vaccines arr giving people covid. Absolutely mind boggling. 

Others seem think vaccines risky covid itself. Yep that's right I've heard people tell safer covid vaccine. remember told aunt us vaccinated people drop dead soon lol. Still waiting drop desd I'm sure it'll happen day lmao.  Misinformed people seem tell lot misinformed stories... feel like can't work way, could anything fact Pfizer dose like 40 micrograms Moderna one ~~120~~ 100 micrograms?

Your second statement assumes hospital capabilities offering best care. local hospital monoclonal antibody outpatient clinic set week, poor set prescribing patients showing doors. friend went hospital low blood oxygen, told case mild qualify antibodies. thought pneumonia hospital X-ray physical exam show clear signs it. came back hospital two days later diagnosed pneumonia, asked monoclonal antibodies, said passed treatment window day before. imagine would frustrating doctor working conditions can't order x-ray prescribe antibody treatment hospital can't handle demand, would easy start blaming patients.

But there’s actually estimated 40% people got covid annually due underreporting that’s masks half country, UK study performed 16 months includes strains Delta, even article doesn’t cover Delta.

Big side eye Covid guy point.  ""they want covid mild flu promised"" - makes sense behavior believed Trump implicitly, 100%. narrative, covid like flu, masks necessary, shutdowns downright evil, lots potential treatment options, vaccine important element election campaign come soon enough serve purpose. Even get covid, fine.

People believe narrative, overrides everything thinking. real-world fact event conflicts narrative, get angry. narrative cannot challenged. respect hustle all, jesus christ Meanwhile[Montana hospitals enter crises antivaxxers would get hospital make room people actually need hospital.

Agree. original post replying said this:

""Compassion? anti vaxxers? traitors treated such. good civil liberties they’re dead experience it? want kill themselves, let them. drag madness. deserving compassion. willful murderers. Cowards.""

This attitude becoming common assume unvaccinated portrayed media, think small minority. leads mocking get sick going far hope die. helpful anyone - helpful trying urge people get vaccinated, helpful mental health. reason referring believe majority unvaccinated. fair, they're quaffing hospital disinfectant apparently (benetine something like that?)  gives wrong impression say republicans. low percentage Republicans. have, far, people total states. have, far, Democrats. have, far, independents. far Independents Republicans, even. Republicans come third numbers here, distant third.

Only handful states smaller percentage Republicans. states extremely well covid. coincidence states highest percentage party cared listen science better healthier populations. political care either party, someone asked party cared voters, would point facts. answer obvious. Republicans literally killing voters.

Trump could made national hero smart enough covid. Republican party could party saved people. Unfortunately them, people charge wise enough.  Getting covid gonna worse getting vaccinated, already problems breathing.
