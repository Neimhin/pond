There course crazy number different factors consider (hopefully) there'll studies best approaches. Masks probably help. Social distancing probably helps. Good hygiene probably helps. Licking used tissues patients probably hinders. Isolating vulnerable probably helps. follow best guidance best can. see sub Japan cases Tokyo only, Japan one city cases only? Makes sense. paid though lot money 10 n95s Feburary. can't find any. hard tell rural state data this. live Rural Utah, age, lifestyle, rural areas similar. Look Iron county Utah charts , says Critical red. rural landlocked college town , small hospital 6 ICU beds, none used. Even though 200 active cases, one hospital average age county 24. Iron County almost exactly like Madison county Idaho, small landlocked college town. places worry Idaho, Utah, Wyoming place retirement 55 communities, older population lives. 130000 people died dumbass amount determined? mathematical formula? part existing budget? amazing issue dont know long anti bodies stay shown disappear 3(?) months so, would vaccine useful case? never said driving. Wow bro epic funny Also, people stop yapping pass people. understand world works ffs?

I'm ticked well member Generation - going reflect poorly entire generation. Folks going judge us small number idiots take poorly. Elsewhere, I've seen young people good, sometimes even older citizens, one asking trouble.

Another issue bars probably closed again, safe. may remain way vaccine available bars may need require government help. see alternative. Drunk patrons going social distance, wear masks, etc.  beating virus asap cost us bigger economical price long term.  *cries Swedish* Probably. would feel ashamed tested positive acted selfish though. Locking gate horse bolted.

The real problem social media (or honest facebook) people get ""information"" people trust - friends family. trust (too many) people almost impossible persuade Person X told something wrong.   Laws compromises anarchy. literally sacrifice freedoms greater good. People won’t even wear scrap fabric face. bit much expect even though it’s logical. Don’t worry Mitch back legislation keep sick people suing. back starting virustopia.  impotence symptom, masks would mandatory Jan.

That said terrified. students ( ages 3-22) never going wear masks, require hands support, many require toileting assistance. outbreak program going spread like wildfire. Yeah isn’t works, guy doesn’t know he’s talking can't get labors work construction business. pays unemployment temp workers get normally. need push broom take trash. takers? Shitty science reporting new level. I'm sorry...you lose points wanting kids? seems ridiculous day age :/ apologize behalf government. part reason manufacturing sector literally V-shaped recovery. latest PMI figures higher pre-covid Yeah there’s muscle memory long able train it’ll come back eventually least 70 percent people Vancouver acting like virus never existed. Social distancing? planet people living on? lol, would called sheep Texas. partying value life. clearly dont care others put harms way. Half year passed people still didnt learn anything. Agree points. 300 million 8 billion... That's good ratio. instance: used infect mice lab Influenza treat various treatments. InfA grown eggs gave mice different dilutions inoculation. ones got 1/1000 dilution obviously got less virus ones got 1/100 dilution on. lot people assume, get sick, get sick. Actually, dilution affected bad mice got sick. higher dilution resulted less damage less severe symptoms. coronavirus humans. single command load module? 2020, 1999. Every business uses Linux, know use learn. say wrong (because I'm sure means)... see possible already 5-years trial disease appeared half year ago.

I don’t think it’s wise.

I seriously doubt harm kids, believe they’ll bring home vulnerable family. Horrible idea. Making mandatory scare lot people. Best thing free (or cheap) heavily endorse popular figues. Goverment also need make easy access anytime easy follow instruction. 

Cracking anti-vax also need nessary, especially online. Dont governors kids?! Dont care children might get sick die?! Shitty weather, ugly women, housing crisis, tiny island, coronavirus vaccine.

However, think go well half europe economy doomed virus.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Jesus take wheel!

Why eager kill base? Seriously (I'm here) news people taking locally provided masks burning them. I'm sick many people around us taking seriously making mockery ""barely 100 people died"". Thanks! Contact health provider. thermometer oxygen meter, use those. go symptoms speak doctor. They're basically giant sailing Petri dishes. spend 2+ weeks people visit numerous ports locations. Even post-Covid I'm going reluctant. real dicks employees. wedding planned September. put things somewhat hold, started back seemed worst over. actually sent invitations week things started spike. also mention I'm NH, total cases 6000, active cases 550, total deaths little 400. 

We tentatively going forward, though mad anyone feel comfortable coming, canceling always menu. come plan B Covid though. venue outdoors, wedding 1/3 capacity ""before times"", socially distancing tables issue, table charts grouped people already interact with. Taking cue tiny town Footloose probably dancing, subbing pub trivia games played tables (I actually prefer this) I'm still trying convince fiancee safest way bouquet toss mark grid whoever owns square lands ""wins.""

So... may still idiots, cancelling still option, area cases thinking ways minimize close interaction even then. Laws made broken. China might try invade Russia. considering US right now, country might even exist then. Escondido here, I've seen horror footage cities regarding masks. I've far national city noticed pretty well far masks concerned. going Riverside OC visit family, different story. went one anti-masks group, posted reasons wear masks, got banned trolling. misuse word ""asymptomatic"". means symptoms all.

Most instead mild symptoms. Like light cough cold. already proved Philippines. 5% asymptomatic. majority - 95% - mild symptoms least. time organize defense.

I'm going give example numbers; they're accurate way, help illustrate point. 

Imagine city needs 7 days fully organize good defense moment detects invasion. 

If get 1 invading enemy duplicates every day, day 7 128 enemies, city kicks ass rather easily. technically infection, developed antibodies fight it, even get symptoms. asymptomatic. Still, PCR test able detect enemies indeed there, 128 already enough detectable. 128 small riot. 

If start invasion 1000 enemies, duplicates every day, day 7 128000 enemies city gets rather overwhelmed even getting chance put fight. get symptoms. there's chance might make it, enemy numerous defenses might little, late. 128000 full-force invasion. 

This article explained. strains, medical workers. everybody wearing masks way launch fewer virus particles towards others absorb fewer virus particles others, making probable milder infection, even enemies invade, they're easier manage.

Ninjaedit:

The issue medical workers they've exposed people full-blown infections, they've carried procedures (for example, intubation) launched inordinate numbers virus particles directly doctors' faces. instead contact one mildly infected person 30 minutes bar, they've contact 20 severely infected people 12 hours hospital. They've exposed many, many virus particles. get invasion, get full-force invading army, one single commando guy. think rather self-serving conspiracy theory.  concern shared many times over, anecdotal cases people last catch family getting worst. However, there's still insane amount stuff know mechanisms disease, anecdotal stories scientific evidence (though keep background minds case think pattern).

In practice, routine relationship need look much different. Excellent hand surface hygiene job eliminating shed virus, even one home alone. keep dirty work clothes separate cardboard box away rest laundry. Little cleanliness things add up. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* order 100 million even knowing it’s effective? Why? usually happens? thought anti American?? wear mask?  Everybody mask expert paying attention. Yes seemed escalate quite quickly, although rest country seems fine. superapreading events caused increase cases? Determining using age evidence based practice. Look Apache II, SAPS II. mortality algorithm uses age. Learn bit talk.   fires due methane leaks melting permafrost? permafrost gone due heat, happen anymore. silver lining really bad situation, will.  Yes. SHITTY doctoring. Jumping conclusion reinfected within 3 months KNOW people suffering symptoms nearly long seems like stretch.

Likely ACTUAL situation: still virus low level previous negative false-negative.

EVEN reinfected, EVEN assume every story true reinfection, puts possibility happening something like .001%... That's fucking rounding error.  think actually correct. It’s benefiting employees themselves. Busch gardens Tampa close well. Granted it’s based self-reporting, Disney hasn’t reported cases tied parks. Busch Gardens Tampa taking Instagram twitter posts employees sick Covid.

They literally killing people. masks required Netherlands Aldis. 

But dont massive outbreaks anymore, surprised masks become mandatory second wave hits though. Washing hands low hanging fruit. Even though route transmission cases, eliminate takes little investment. cool. L W. truth, I'm glad see unlike people sub. Whenever topic mentioned, seem automatically label trumpsters, republicans, conspiracists, antimaskers, etc... discredit that. I'm none above. I'll give credit due, I'll point faults regardless political spectrum status. even convince doctor masks works back February. believed CDC blindly.

Not everything Factcheck.org true. cannot trust blindly anyone matter. Believing blindly appealing authority, huge problem mask issue beginning pandemic.

*__Ethos important, without Logos.__* Last one stay alive pay funerals without insurance. still make masks. took longer. could plausibly conclude people died result.

We could used defense production act early make large supply. Let's sacrifice Chinese/Asian American save lives!

Trump Flu! Now? YES! want thank comment well. parents loved ones starting get older spend lot time feeling really it. I’ve got moderately bad depression often wonder I’m going able cope things life already makes unbearably sad. However comment really really helped me, seems done many people 9 years since posted it. Again, thank much sharing wisdom us.

Also want say I’m glad you’re well. Stay safe. places I've ever lived would habitable without Disney cruise book least year advance choice room, like want balcony. handicapped, bookings open closer year half. US? don’t know one told Moderna vaccine recruiting Stage 3 trial already. Personally HCW would confident volunteer, although area thankfully prevalence probably low justify trialled far. yet people reddit constantly spread misinformation mask protects people way around, keep claiming protect wearer. people need see  Lmao “show proof wasn’t thousands across country protesting”

Minnesota spiking. know, place protests started...

Protests obviously help, thing worse reopening evidence states suffering worst rn.  Even CDC said wear masks, none found anywhere general public end feb. Where’s proof though? That's insane vents ever delivered. Thousands extra state. 

The multi code problem real, PPE remains issue. Staff huge issue, particularly appropriately trained staff. still nurses never ICU trained taking care ICU patients. exacerbates problem patients decompensate. vaccines needed results, strategy focus therapeutics. 

As Fauci says, ""I'm cautiously optimistic."" share sentiments. South Korea really big masks, that's line train thought Ozone depletion might stay problem polar vortexes weaken due warmer weather. Otherwise bio-domes might viable solution. Life going lot harder future, impossible.  haole lived Hawaii foe 7 years, thats surprising. Hawaiians actually care (huge) families compassion/empathy. aunty hits head slippah. Either way, best wear damn mask.

Aloha mainland hope stay healthy safe. COVID give blood clots, like call pudding blood.

Pudding blood travels around body, clogging blood vessels, boom stroke, kidney failure, liver failure, psychosis.

I remember last year cities rolling corpse trucks July. Definitely wasn’t thousands gathering! them! Nope😂 lot people say asymptomatic symptoms coincide permanent damage covid like lung issues etc. something neurological things disabling pain receptors blah blah. mask wearing asymptomatic coincide permanent damage stuff ? name stupid. Uranus problems one cares. Aldi requiring since end May Germany, mandated law. Weird took long implement States. ?? [Wtf?] temporarily bypasses immune response virus substantially cultured infected mucosa pharynx.

So would larger initial dosage matter? dosage larger get stage quickly. 

If dosage small would seem like would stay immune privileged area produced critical mass reach mucosa pharynx either way.

I would think amount exposure would extremely trivial compared amount virus generated replicating several days, seems like either way immune system becomes aware time.

For matter way explaining would make seem like wearing mask would bad user, would exhaling repeatedly inhaling essentially giving repeated megadose initial exposure.

Curious thoughts wrong right? testing find cases, there. mean need look positivity rate well number tests. it’s high and/or going that’s USA done lot tests, per 1 million population leading pack (currently number 24): seen California since beginning shit? obey type social distancing rules. still lounging beach COVID parties. 

Gotta trolling You’re rather optimistic face fuzzy data. hope you’re right, truly, wouldn’t bet house getting lives back next year, ever... also feels like common fucking sense. Barrier front mouth nose == yes, good amount people’s germs aren’t getting you. Yeah good you. current reality extended perpetuity. Chances we'll decent therapeutic stop people getting sick. I’ve read strain currently circulating (most of?) US contagious less lethal variety original strain China. majority people wearing masks? pyramid scheme. added bonus management funds get hands cookie jar. China Virus

Lol Oooh, thanks. Even nicer house a/C, room's cooled fan &amp; little water a/C. except thats exactly multiple studies confirming, initial level exposure matters severe affected Take bullshit pages like Josh Feuerstein spread misinformation propaganda large audiences. lag time viral load small initial dose vs large one may play. body time recognise virus begin mount immune response overwhelmed (particularly way novel virus tends overwhelm, cytokine storms), odds better recovery milder case.

This plasma used recovered individuals, gain time immune response sick patients. ***Seek professional mental help. issues... god complex. Determining age fuck lawsuit.*** particular concern right GO campaign promoting discounted domestic travel government upcoming long weekend (Thursday \~ Sunday). data available cariovascular event deaths yet? blood clotting would imagine there's excess deaths too. tell end whether placebo.

Imagine virus peanut butter. Shedders hands covered it, repeating events peanut butter face. 

Translate surface contamination. Elevator buttons small numerous, peanut butter boy touched 2 buttons. touch less likely become peanut butter face.

That 44% number people state wear masks time public.


You realize means 56% majority? Hazard small town rural southeast Kentucky extremely Republican (I would say conservative, Republican conservative aren’t thing anymore). I’m guessing figured COVID isn’t Democratic hoax. realisation come gave noticed capitalisation name title.  fucking piece shit. 5 hours driving sealtbelt digs neck. wear it? 

The kids lunch breaks take masks, littles snacks too. responsible, monitored times take “mask break” little ones. Again, 60% compliance better throwing hands admitting defeat uncomfortable. 

I’ll add, I’m middle school teacher. know I’m disrespect foolishness kids don’t want comply. still think it’s worth it. seems true virus longer reproductive phase. difference infected one cell vs thousands lag cycle two. long cycle could allow time body launch response, adaptive immune system since that's really dependent time.

He'll things try make better, work, eventually 4 8 years we'll start coming side. time people forgotten Trump GOP handed booming economy ruined it, elect another republican immediately cut taxes rich, give free handouts mega corps spend next 4-8 years tanking economy. See side. accurate metaphor would seatbelts masks way, they're they're involving experts knowledge. They're going political spin actual information guidance. Climate alarmism pays! think hilarious oil people would shitting bricks, apparently Big Green wrong. Yep. recommended suggestions senate committee studying pandemic response 2014 basically ramp testing, mandatory quarantine upon entry states period time, contact trace necessary cases show up. 

When travel bans from, say China, occur. usually find someone flies south Korea continue on. continue spread intermediate country spreads makes worse. go along this, even grocery workers aren’t safe silencing. go get tested COVID want to, take unpaid time work get results back. feel sick enough get tested, it’s best stay home. doesn’t even take account may want tested see we’re asymptomatic allergies taking precautions. think, could worse. Imagine protests demonstrations. Oh wait... naive all, think certain kids intelligent enough understand masks important. stated, better giving kid friends wash hands take dump. things cant really helped though. Even best virtual learning wont effective many kids, especially special needs need hands assistance. OT unable physically move students hand virtually PT unable help change walk motion student learning walk correctly. Non verbal students struggle relate difficulties non verbal environment. Also students losing social supports many positive experiences motivating (Sports clubs) never come back seniors. Add loss intimacy ability feel close others zoom replicate ability hug friend someone crying. Kids struggle feeling alone already emphasized that. Ah yes... really experience time anymore, still thought mid-July. Thank reminder. also wait lot longer test results, theory could drive number K Aw man, time hope bullshit ""it hurt children"" true.. now, god knows long term damage kids have. funny mentioned got COVID stay relevant. ""Look me"" syndrome. Yeah agree either, think since exact scenario screaming need crickets fuck it, argument entirely moot.
That definitely happen though, martial law military mobilization people? Every single person would ordered would traitor country say unlawful order. Otherwise starvation kill them, covid.

That's exactly part frustration. choice risking life risking life. exactly kind thing government could stepping help. Assuming choice working starving pandemic means assuming government, despite capable taking action, *going let people starve*. Shock Doctrine term I’ve heard. keep hearing experimental guess anyone test subject, best afford it. true?! god, that's literally degrees away actual slavery: ""Okay, pay enough afford home, we'll let live here!"" ""But want quit, move, go strike try negotiate better terms?"" Norway. Huh, several big brains telling wouldnt happen announced US buying supply drug, since paid for, would free. I'm pretty sure matter happens I'll always sacrificial lamb working grocery store never close us down.  Sad part get paid way less would got furloughed laid collected unemployment. prepare die extra money many like me.  lives never matter people want restrictions get groceries quarantined safely home.  That's America though right? I’ve America life. 21 years I’ve slowly seen nation grew thinking greatest earth decay become shit day. I’ve constantly told, fully agree with, American citizens themselves. care fellow citizens. America taught preschool kindergarten none would happening. Unfortunately large group people simply care anyone themselves. ""Testing trends'"" meaning, trends positive cases positivity rates. wonder judges require masks hearings. 

Or, judges even attend in-person.  Mama said “Covid conspiracy”  agree. I’m strong proponent reopening - even agree come strong measures prevent infections. strict penalties defy it. can’t two sets rules two different groups. Treat protests would outdoor sporting event concert - can’t one, can’t other. Duh course flattens run room. sending hundreds patients state hundreds dying shit hospital rates flatlined. mean anything getting better. making problems worse everywhere else instead. story rather depressing, mostly stemming parents using child (who falls autism spectrum) spokesperson. 

You want kid like her, parents proudly pointing 11 year old Asperger's refused eat years slowly spoon feed bite taught world implode. Wonder why... No, polite civil discussion gave up. think nice impacted anything thanked tone replies. I'd like think thought came around. Friend friend hard know. Thank reply.
I tossing random examples. Considering audience selective examples. don’t seem see irony protecting people likely work campaigns vote them. Two months later, people dead, hospitalized, incapacitated. 90% goes random ""administrative costs""... never life ever tolerate people wasting doughnuts. adding said - benefit readers may want see detailed response Dr Paul Marik regarding this.

No offense intended. Numbers still insanely high, especially per capita, encouraging cases still seem sort trending down, hospitalizations trending two-week lag case trend. 

I know positivity sky high there's lot uncertainty, correlation trends good evidence there's legitimate peak. we'd expect deaths keep rising another week give take start decline also.

But fast declines whether plateaus rises entirely dependent behavior people Arizona coming weeks. impressed handling Covid-19.

Are rich people coming realization competent government actually matters? government policies affects everybody, including rich? never understood argument ""Yeah US sucks many ways, make ton money there!!"" That's sensible. Also, think first million doses rightly considered experiment, thought given quality data produces. giving recovered could cloud understanding efficacy. sad nobody's talking long term lung damage, reports stated there's scars lungs ... sure hospitalized all, definitely something concerned  Hey hateful racist. [Look results Google search socks off. Okay, one hand astounded people thinking conservatives evil.

On other, name two positions ""not conservative"" on, one two first things comes mind you, unlike conservatives (or people ""more conservative"") ""believe wearing masks.""

Doncha kinda see illustrative point there, one hallmarks modern conservatism thought pressed wearing mask thus intentionally infecting people around you? make little understandable people would say inflammatory things like ""Conservatism place modern society.""?  Florida: hold eggnogg watch this..... moved hundred patients, hospital number would gone up. Without data point hard tell long average stay whether getting better etc calls Dr. Faucet. He’s smart enough use parenthesis. swedish middle class top upper class international standards Yeah ER numbers probably promising trying look ahead what's come. Less people feeling sick enough warrant ER visit 100% great thing ultimately leads less less inpatients covid hospitals. 

I'm wondering mask mandates local mayors Maricopa County working Oh gosh I'm sick holding in! hear America great never change I'm like... We're living timeline right? 

I really want go people done religion that's another day.  women going hate her? misandrist comment. I’m curious, don’t agree with, said? First, risk same. grocery store hour two, max-- recommendation buy go less often. grocery store involve 10+ minutes close contact one person, seems big risk factor. true standing long lines. people stay day Disney, people travel get there, people stay somewhere besides home Disney trip. orders magnitude risk.

Second, necessity same. Someone must get groceries-- taking risk, hiring shopper get groceries deliver them. Food critical humans. Theme parks not. agree. But, least fair point small population (proportional testing support), full community support serve small population nearly infinite amounts money involved miiiiight able little better locking 330,000,000 people economy never truly 100% ""pause."" literal surgeon general said something similar worse 99 Cent store. cent more, less protected? Jesus.... Yeah honestly thought outdoors saw one Disney vlogs day mentioned/showed indoor really surprised, lol. can’t good don’t want downplay factor teens young people hanging understanding gravity situation. falls parents sure issue. 

But can’t help see media keeps glossing real issue here. article says biggest Coronavirus age group MO KS 20-24 25-34. saw spike age group lot country reopened. Hotels, bars, shops, parks, restaurants called (overwhelmingly 20-something) staff back jobs, closely interacting dozens hundreds people day, 20-something’s started getting sick. *What mystery. Must damn kids hanging going parties.*

I know article teens specifically parents still say actions. mention parents sending teens work, KSC wants keep kids home. supposed instill responsibility- public health work- teenagers doesn’t apply rest workforce? keep seeing older coworkers show can’t risk losing unemployment? supposed tell teens can’t work see friends plan sending back school month? still use Facebook messenger call family get cell coverage house.

You actual telephone? Funny. cell phone. Certainly ain't best time protest either. like absolutely need within next month numbers rising back time high...

Edit: Sorry misleading, might time high. got confused USA Understatement the...I don't...some period time. #Detectable ≠ Transmissible

We detect RNA without Capsid can't enable transmission Without demand people attend parks, people working job, eventually. Opening limited capacity every measure place minimize risk seems reasonable ensuring staff maintain livelihood accept risk exchange paycheck. reddit awards like first time too, happen pay myself!

yuk yuk yuk agree healthier people better chance fighting off. that’s said. said chance getting goes unhealthy that’s accurate. contact one virus odds contracting regardless health. yes healthier better chance won’t severe symptoms. doesn’t mean healthy people don’t get really sick helps reduce chance severe symptoms. Maybe calling one ignorant need read posted. seeing this. testing trending slightly flat positive percentage trending slightly up. agree. Yes, good part blame go responsible re-openings, you’re going Disney right hanging non-essential businesses hours, ashamed endangering employees families. see concerns compliance rate similar issue statement text. say is: ""these prevent virus spreading ""detrimental"" measures adopted containment. "".

and call statement bullshit. 2-3 infected people spread virus less outweight 2-3 infected people reduced chance spreading it.

I bought 3 reusable FFP3 masks Februrary maybe 15 USD each. One used far, parents home (in case father needs good one). Two use since beginning March sure use months replace them.

I doubt could lower price using single use surgical masks sewing something own, doubt selfmade masks would secure secondary result also community. still sci-fi though, hover cars Blade Runner. like think dystopian futurism one many sub genres sci fi I'd curious see it. almost universal story drops 100s cases reinfection later updated dead viruses causing false positives. I'm sure happen, I'm thinking going rare. read, explains paper However, study reach target enrolment stringent public health measures used Wuhan led marked reductions new patient presentations mid- March, restrictions hospital bed availability resulted patients enrolled later course disease. Consequently, could adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might provided clinical benefit. 

So paper show Remdesivir doesn’t work, incorrectly claimed. different study, problems enrolling patients, showed work.

PS: testing COVID results philippines lagged 3 weeks least 1.5 Months worst SINCE LOCK 3 MONTHS AGO well ok almost 1 month since NCR eased meaning numbers getting isnt ""up date"" IE everyday missing 3 weeks valuable data

this doesnt help suddenly cant trace 20M PHP funds

and thats considering even testing ""drives"" none

and lagged test results means lot meaning people react timely manner hotspots lost cause

the likely saving grace would neighbohood chismis even isnt helpful information shit money would dipped US awhile back hold place like NZ Besides good military that's sick fight. Sunbathing includes nitric oxide, lowers blood pressure, need. also take 15,000 IUs every day. can't sunbath, take 20,000 IUs. Nooooope... vocal minority. polls put % people take vaccine around 18%.  false based fact.

There actually link posted chain disproves that. Check out. producing assumption product approved release. Words nobody even heard of! countries?

You mean vast majority?  probably also sponsored big Pharma. ensure sufficient customers. Herd immunity generally achieved 75-90% depending virus.  I’m group. use workout 5-10 hours week helped teach kids Tae Kwon Do. I’ve gotten 5,000 steps day I’m exhausted. use average, 20k+ steps day.   that's opinion entitled to. like masks, protected right. challenged many times never found violate anything court.

Not liking something make unconstitutional.  released good Phase 1 results.

That nice Phase 3 data started UK April.

They refuse release even discuss it. appear chasing hot zones trying get clinically significant results. 

Phase 3 UK probably showed minor efficacy doubt would get approval need chase infections hope get emergency approval. 20-25 percent like no, clear violation law typically pretty clear cut elderly abuse.

But reporting goes nowhere.

Again, appreciate she’s trying certainly don’t want bound folks calling names making fun her. 

However, saying goes “the road hell paved good intentions” reason. condemns modern world use carbon, offers nothing condemnation. more. Cut more. Weren’t British scientists already working vaccines SARS etc? build upon thing that’s it’s damn quick. hell people getting 10k? really sucks though can't get unemployment. apparently paying really well right now! interesting, idea. Didn’t suspect recovering SARS gave immunity least year?? swear I’ve heard multiple times. We’re gonna shoot Coronavirus face northern Wisconsin right now, that’s really dumb. I’m sorry family making decision. scenario abuse. giving additional information.  think intent state mind matter quite bit here.

But without doubt, criminal needs approached such. including bioterrorism. see posted time, neglects tested. 139 clients, 67 tested COVID-19 negative. others declined get tested, none reported developing symptoms, according report.

What 72? Who's ""we""?

Do work Gilead? think they're thinking private islands family compound one else.

Edit: Personally, I'd rather NZ.  U.K. though, right? sounds way better heard U.S. working on. r/debtfree fuck isn't. still 40+% approval rating, people actually vote, unlike people like mean fucking thing nobody turns vote.

Don't wait election day. Register vote early. might feel little swelling such. Plus obviously PCR swap surface mucosa might show positive result, you‘ll likely never get point systemic infection. 

Most stories I've read reinfections involve person ending hospital second infection. seems like stretch argue old sickness decided come roaring back 4 months initial diagnosis.

Of course could ton people encounter described, seems though possibility exists reinfection somewhat severe. 2006 ancient history, vaccines around lot longer that. think situation changed much since 2006. instance, coronaviruses may induce short-lived immunity. may reason humans subject multiple infections coronaviruses cause common cold.

This could prove problem long-standing immunity SARS-CoV2, given already problem existing coronaviruses infect humans. fully believe that, think internet would help tho.. ICU numbers since week ago. Positive cases date specimen collection looks like peaked 2 weeks ago.

But yes, total hospitalizations (again driven non-ICU cases) 1 higher previous 'record' couple days ago. Let's burn down? record set previous 'record' Friday adjusted 2.

Or could take things context whole took take trends together. thinking 2009 movie ""2012""? thing wear masks hot kitchen. like nice cool room AC. Correct, leave Denver literally free all. think something else going happen US end virus? Barring miraculous vaccine, herd immunity way thing happen country actively sabotaging coronavirus response many places, nothing prevent spread. way every major pandemic eradicated early ended past. Vaccine not, certainly way end pandemic. 

So please enlighten us amazingly intelligent solution pandemic discussing. know, stop fucking asshole, one. There's one causes fungal, necrotic growth perineum. see commercials time. That's tainted taint right there. I'd take one step call elder abuse. one deserves shut shit extent get sores mean helper cells work every time. Especially Th2's since secrete IL-4 activate B cells produce antibodies. functioning healthy immune system, cell mediated humoral response work together clear virus.  Helpers bridging gap two. Also side note, Oxford's vaccine cause cell mediated response. True.

But yeah we’ve strength conditioning camps awhile. official. Chinese vaccines.

This good test case. Sweden course never locked down, yet somehow cases went like NY's.

So could good test US see lockdown + mandatory masks necessary stop continued growth. Sounds right :-(   going ignore fact actually serious threat 60 years old? Also ignore fact 34 million Americans diabetes 42% adults obese, factors make virus significantly dangerous. World Health Organization estimates 290,000 650,000 people die flu-related causes every year worldwide, whereas 600.000 people died far. mention Covid-19 mutating rapidly absolutely immunity it, opposed influenza. anyone say two related? I’m sorry. similar fears Hugh risk older parents mean world kids see times week. live TX people really wearing masks. One kids friends invited son swim, call ask questions thinking would two boys hours. No! wanted take church event (without asking me) home swim 3 boys. It’s middle pandemic here, crazy? like well drop swim then. kid exposed whole church! People suck. son mad ☹️. R K E first developed sars vaccine severe side effects later killed mouses Horsemen? Feels like Horsemen... :( obvious too. Look Florida data compared states. They're even trying hide it. wear mask go sure stay away others Nah anyone else taking shit seriously. presumably know people sex least name phone number. know every store clerk, bus passenger, gas station attendant etc interact daily basis? doubt it. people would need contacted catching Covid 19. Look polls western powers, people overwhelmingly care far climate change 5 years ago. People also acknowledging extent threat easy solution, require cut backs changes way live lives. Climate change central issue western elections politicians constantly trying out-do one ambitious targets/commitments. I'm course saying Greta responsible doubt raising huge amounts awareness surrounding issue.


You asked proof quick searches:

The UK - - today EU announced biggest green stimulus package tune 500B - They’ll pass bill increase Coronavirus spending 10%, decide 9% go military link proves point. beyond stupid. mean. Tin foil hat on. Sell twice vaccines. United States bottom third nations car accidents per 100k people. Why? regulate hell cars, roads, drivers! Seat belts became mandatory many people died car accidents- drunk driving laws became tougher many people dying car accidents. Driving ages went graduated licensing restrictions introduced many people dying car accidents. Without regulations fatal accident rates could order magnitude higher now. really made cringe. worst part crowd wildly applauding mighty feat. re-enactment walking ramp might’ve worse, though. whole thing embarrassment. Yeah he’s totally gonna say stupid shit. Wikipedia: “Anthropomorphism attribution human traits, emotions, intentions non-human entities.”

Basically, time see animal character media portrayed person, that’s anthropomorphic. Like instance, Spongebob anthropomorphic sea sponge Goofy anthropomorphic dog.

And Pluto, also dog (who admittedly portray human-like emotions), contrasted side side Goofy, walks upright, speaks wears clothes, it’s weird!  neat, many us beyond tired using flimsy bullshit dismiss criticism. logic feels weird me. 

hey government cant tell wear mask. even help prevent others harmed/die.

but problem telling wear pants underwear public wangs vaginas gross out. 3 UK probably failed.

Any evidence back believe current new trial Brazil uses 2 doses**. Meaning would require new trials would take 4-6 months.

Any evidence back phase 3 trials double dose regiment get approval double.

There indeed using double dose Phase company exploring regimens, first readout final-stage tests almost definitely two doses, Mene Pangalos, Astra’s head biopharma research, told reporters.

And considering knew results Phase I/II going phase III, likely knew would go double dose testing capacity. I'll stop feeding troll now. anything Covid either? know posted r/coronavirus right? US spends much government allows insurance pharmaceutical companies price gouge people. Getting rid middle men alone would drop costs dramatically Jesus Christ man pet, would’ve put ages ago.

Hi, name Joe... know rest. I'm taking much time now. no. seem think underaged girl legislator. fact girl started worldwide movement directly well indirectly brought upon change awareness. actually real life effects today her. is: pass laws.

Well, 15/16 started. Give age, amazing stuff. fund education fix healthcare? problem!   totally ignore recent results published Lancet, come conclusion.  agree. recent riots caused significant spike covid. use 10% military budget stop riots, would definitely flatten curve. sound like bunch real ne'er-do-wells. half weren't. We're record hospitalizations still climbing surpassed April peak week ago. point trying make? ""Don't worry man, half people old No, hell no. There’s thing freedom speech principle allow people spread lies kill thousands. need take step back precise definitions realize you’re choosing death destruction need flexible always choosing best path forward regardless sort outdated imperfect narrowly-defined principles painted us corner. New situations call new actions. PANDEMIC.

I still believe Facebook social media companies able ban whoever want, remedy people leaving platform disagree. especially pandemic able ban disinformation could kill thousands. guess there’s considerable number reported deaths India. Don’t really enough information speculate actually number, would imagine would substantial. Read [this BBC news pay particular attention section titled ""What next steps results far promising, main purpose ensure vaccine safe enough give people.  study cannot show whether vaccine either prevent people becoming ill even lessen symptoms Covid-19.  10,000 people take part next stage trials UK.  trial also expanded countries levels coronavirus low UK, making hard know vaccine effective.  large trial involving 30,000 people US well 2,000 South Africa 5,000 Brazil. No. Yes, yes is. rising every day. Remember, NY's peak deaths hit weeks total shutdown. many hotspots, business booming. Also, hospitals full... everyone starts dying easily treatable conditions. guy really nails it. believe America told stories child. believe America unites overcomes its' problems together. looks matter came legal not, matter religion personal life choices brought land. That's America see right now, that's one i'm personally working see future. Keep perspective skew it? Seems like apples Mars bars comparison me. Might less military started Innerspace force. Considering face much greater threats outter space considering we're depending military civilian medical care might good idea. healthcare part military certain party might actually take seriously fund it. smh indeed. chances populations successfully distribute vaccine general US public receives them? cynical side says: high Guess republican states areas California locking US collection lot different cultures types people, shitty people get publicity. need judge country idiots make look bad... plenty places US decent people left. I'm west coast always preferred people / way life west parts country. However, every one preferences somewhere everyone here.

Aside said, still would like leave country live somewhere else... that's Hope test comes negative. I’m assuming you’re Germany come positive, least good healthcare there. Uhhh pandemic. ""safe"" go around people anywhere! less dangerous dangerous depending go long stay there. 

Why still asking questions?? Getting updated information lying. ok  sure facts upset people really not. can't sign rights away, even do, court give flying fuck case involves negligence, clearly would.  10 5 0? Americans don’t tend give fuck people unless dramatically impacts us personally. problem stupid nation little propaganda makes masses go crazy Wow, getting faster faster. think thirty something days 2m 3m fifty something days 1m - 2m. would doctors/medical examiners put COVID-19 cause death? one ever risk health safety paycheck. shameful little America cares workers. poor “to bad! Go back work risk getting COVID starve!” 

Right want make illegal sue employers failing protect workers COVID. listen episode -- really good. I'd say US joke, jokes funny, what's going beyond pathetic. could see tests/vaccines international arrivals.

Iceland already test arrival. said.

They still data.

I stand corrected believe trials brazil SA using 2 doses.

That appears hint failed would require totally new trials.

People prepared AZ pushing timeline back mid 2021 best now. fair title wrong many years invasions. half year ""invaded"". important thing note antibodies count indicator vaccine's efficiency. far remember, Oxford vaccine also promotes generation Killer T-Cells, also help infection. Also, body degrades antibodies time, Cells body generate response infection. simple ""you generate antibodies float around blood years either get infected disappear"".   Things change dime w/ virus. guess we'll see districts open &amp; closed school season arrives. interesting data districts open, many families actually send kids school. Yeah states even million people. Gary Johnson got 4.5 million votes 2018 no. Actually, there’s whole business cheaper tickets employees. make lot money.

Also pay $15 lowest Disney Land, doubt got paid 16 Where's u/spez need him?  need state funded elections. 

E1. I’m making wishlist: Election Day National Holiday. know I’m probably preaching choir. Per capita, they’re hitting Texas/Florida numbers.

Population 5 million. situation like someone needed ventilator access one covid patients using them. That's COVID death talking many people pandemic killing, even contribute virus's mortality information. They’ve telling us months. Three reasons - 1) hospitals getting better treat people get sick 2) people *generally* social distancing, wearing masks, initial virus load get smaller, body time get ramped fight virus blooms large lungs, 3) Older vulnerable people cautious, new cases predominantly younger people tend less cautious, get ill. athletes go get fucked die, apparently, according great state texas. right article;

"" Householder flew President Donald Trump's inauguration company's plane 2016. Householder once [released showed shooting television airing called commercial ""anti-Trump gun grabbers,"" boasting ""highest NRA rating Ohio's history."" US governmental spending healthcare, per capita, already equals exceeds countries universal healthcare.

Why think pouring another hundred billion we're already paying trillions going anything?

Do think magically increasing budget 10-25% going much system broken? state’s winning!!! track mobiles easily following knots dialed net. works without app. works even without people giving phone numbers. track mobile phone pops border mobile cells blue.

A friend mine house Prague. wanted get hours Czech border lockdown officially set place. crossed non-guarded border. got SMS telling go back lockdown enacted night. drove on, knows border area really well thought wouldnt found side-route. police car stopping nicely telling go back would stop telling nicely. did.

All takes political enact law. technology place. fair that's entire customer base. Yeah, Briefings gonna propaganda. ""The virus bad, go back work, send kids school, economy needs you, please vote end jail fucking belong."" sort thing. lied, cool Actually, they're *sensitive* required. need less sensitive, cheap test everyone. graphics hideously baffling. Spitting someone assault before. Even best non corona spin, still assaulted old woman. Gross. implying masks self interest? trying attack, trying make sure interpreted words correctly. read article states Gyms high risk. 

I know I'm avoiding gym indefinitely Tell said wrong. 

I'll wait Hahah yeah. Usually ones giving hardest also ones can’t take anything return. open schools huge percent children go, happens then? Perfect. hope right. Japan testing numbers still quite low now. wonder plan expand testing 2021? wear around neck pull see people. Easy enough. COVID would appalling CFR absent huge critical care resources thrown it.

Wouldn't countries like Venezuela Congo getting absolutely wrecked case? infection rate dropped UK. that's move hotspots like brazil s. africa talking perks, you’re changing argument Back unpopular demand, Trump Shit-Show Coronavirus Briefings. Seriously, good I'd say also free antigen tests. address root cause quickly. fair, reopening schools mess that's lot harder solve bars, gyms, hair salons. can't schools closed indefinitely, children's sake working parents. time experience Israel suggests schools best places Covid thrive.

Not sure what's solution here? Obviously brainless reopening it. Maybe children fixed groups mandatory masks could take edge Neither first infections South America North America. came european travelers tourists coming back Europe. Excellent work, Florida. Keep up. Screw masks. maybe coconut carried Texas swallow. saying title explicitly *isn't* lie. 

also, saying leftist want citizens die become homeless covid? seems like reasonable position everyone have. sheesh. wish right country politicized virus. Allegedly none, may mean obese.  Hell, could potentially around forever, virus evolution probably lead adapting better better humans point resembles siblings common cold. rate could dead then. way said China Virus briefing seemed like something immature middle schooner would do. Quite immature makes feel like looks weak. I'm sure allies/enemies feel way. recall top head, remember polls going win - necessarily get votes/etc, even remember 538 running % tracker almost wholly Clinton later evening clear Trump going win. Hopefully 'likeability' factor truly comes play, ridiculous time. Also “beautiful pandemic” somewhere. us make connection. man treasure. Keep good work Doctor!

We doomed Interestingly [seem right top curve today. increases another 3 weeks declining model correct, it’s one best performing ones since April. unlike young people rest people support Trump, people actually vote.

Turnout make difference. wait election day. Register vote early. HCQ + zinc + z pack works way better dirt cheap People started ignoring second deaths started going up. Go onto thread announcing single day less deaths cases peak state find people arguing we've finally flattened curve beaten coronavirus. Usually handful people every thread, every day. actually think testing March? I'm sure NY least 5 times number cases California documented not. people like annoying Big Cemetery lobbying cremations outlawed. fuck sovereign citizen  “What’s more, skepticism largely divided along political lines. Republicans survey (59%) believe death count inflated, 40% May. number independent doubters also rose, climbing 24% 32%. Democrats, hand, likely trust official count, 9% thinking it’s high — slight uptick 7% May.” always war Eurasia. That's exactly thinking. people eating outside instead inside (patios?). depends vaccine. vaccine work old people vaccinate herd immunity protect older people.

However, vaccine stops old people getting sick badly infected, vaccinating elderly probably enough, least short term. 24x higher true that's 96 million Americans. Almost 1 3 people Totalitarianism is. year compared entire lifetime? Cool beans! Next time go Wal-Mart I’m going go around peeing merchandise. Anyone tells stop get smacked head tire iron.

I mean, hey, didn’t want get assaulted shouldn’t told stop peeing store.

That’s you. That’s sound. think two things might hold weight discussion:

1) think virus rampant moment, sheer volume would incredibly difficult begin tracing (especially considering many people vacation, hiring people would difficult)

2) government trusts us right thing, sure, I'll first admit distancing measures sure eased gen pop, nature/culture , us Swedes social distancing decades centuries. transmission albeit slightly somewhat lower would guess due measures, believe realistic government trust people contact tracing themselves, people swedes would get close someone already know (or least close enough spread virus).

Just two cents... Two three months? Make two three years. Where’s school? Meets risk index criteria similar probably theater situation church? yeah, let’s get 20-21 year rolling like NBD.  Hospitality worker here, confirm. Thanks speaking up. I’m wondering going effect curriculum future Elementary Education majors US colleges.  Ahh, meant witnesses. figured someone got pride hurt assaulting someone wouldn’t call police help themself, guess crazier things happened. briefing. 

There 10 minutes tired talking points, back patting, actual new information. Right. Roughly 30% Americans [complete sentence] Roughly 1 3 Americans complete idiots. exactly *accused* China doing. makes sick core. gives llamas bad rap. spitters evil.  saw posts reddit. feel sorry you. wow earlier today ~~3~~ 2 13 times higher. guess get enough reaction that.    certain areas U.S. anywhere 2 13 times higher previously reported figures, according new study published Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC).     number people infected coronavirus different parts United States anywhere two 13 times higher reported rates regions, according data released Tuesday Centers Disease Control Prevention.   

Someone exaggerating story, would they??? know, travel much, and, like bet even tell city right now! People say one hardest questions test! know aced test way? many hospital covid currently compared wave 1? Let's keep maps sure! Sadly, pockets forming several provinces seen cases rise. 

Ontario 200 cases today first time since mid June. Quebec, B.C Alberta also seen rise cases. roses. fully expect briefings Trump self promote election. gloating high ratings. stopped saying stupid shit like drink bleach. expect result.  careful quoting deaths particular day. number cyclical low week half high week. really need least 7 day average you’re going quote numbers. virus is, all, new us. first heard kids weren’t affected [85 children 2 one TX county tested there’s whole aerosol issue. don’t know enough act cocky acting control. I’m early adopter technology bread recipes I’m staying one. He’s actually right lot lately. Trump administration fuckheads past two three months. one wants take ownership decisions needed made. Yeah basically study settling time. submicron aerosolized droplets could take 12 hrs settle surface stagnant environment. larger droplet, like 100 micron settles surface 2 seconds. purpose study examine transmission modes (direct contact vs airborne). sneeze cough, droplets various sizes. breathe speak, tend smaller. sneeze cough could easily immediate transmission. breathing? Breathing alone produce small number (20/min) submicron droplets (basically humidity breathe out), speaking produces 10x that. infected, shedding virus tiny droplets hang air 12 hours. even you’re six feet away person, infected person left store hours ago, could still exposed. It’s likely, happen.

Wind forced air definitely move droplets anywhere. good example cigarette smoke. smoke actually submicron particles well. get whiff cigarette twenty feet away. aerosolized droplets containing virus act way. That’s masks important.

There case studies done showed people social distanced still infected due AC circulating air building.

As understand virus doesn’t last long outside water. Also it’s surfactant, there’s reason would stay ocean surface. even dumped truckloads pure coronavirus ocean, none would survive coast coast trip. needs host survive.  title lie.

This study left wing group phrased questions try get results wanted. past four years relative time peace, America increased defense spending 20 percent. Would support oppose Congress cutting 10 percent $738 billion federal defense budget--with guarantee none cuts would affect American military personnel's pay healthcare -- pay needs like fighting coronavirus, education, healthcare, housing?

The question designed get answer wanted. create propaganda, actual surveys. Ahhh sorry reply /s lost days. much crazy. What’s good option (that buy online) reusable, effective, cloth mask? I’ve wearing surgical mask work would like switch something reusable. Thanks! Ten percent military budget sooo much money. use betterment citizens afterwards? Won’t really work without Ventura, San Berdoo, Riverside OC also going SIP. problem many states seen surge cases. Back April May mainly think NY NJ saw surge cases. headline news. Every day hit new record ""total"" since infected everyday. sort sensational headline Stokes fear. needed. thousand people died today going about? Even *generously* put one month lag funeral publication article, begs question - think happening March, April May?

Head + sand = guy. ""My one child brought home us, imagine classroom full children,"" Terina Neal told KATU News Monday. River County Health Officials currently investigating outbreak associated Hood River Valley High School boys' basketball football teams.
  said kids wore masks maintained physical distance time said young athletes wear masks inside weight room, although six feet apart.   people seven-person household tested positive virus, according Neal. saw company selling unit advertised 'U' shaped could put window sides. “95% infected asymptomatic?”
As opposed many normally? long still social distance? really hopeless now. Making Vaccine hit miss, Vaccines basically fall place, think first one made (smallpox) successful first try. 

Other Vaccines borderline impossible make, HIV one them. 

On others thing, SARS CoV1 example Vaccine caused immune system overreact infected future. run books. Paper digital. Sorry. there’s difference safe effective vaccine vs potential harmful side effect vaccine

you cant look word vaccine consider multiple factors. im saying vaccine working useless.

if date coronavirus least america reported mutations throw everything window

tldr

wait it’s actually saying don’t count chickens hatch ""The chances get sick multiplucative per occasions""

Could explain detail mean part exponential?

If modeled disease simply probability infection occasion called x, odds getting infected would based many interactions (y) would 1-(1-x)^y. (since probability event happening times trials *p*^y, probability happening 1-*p*, probability never happening (or words, happening least once) 1-(1-*p*)^y )

I'm entirely sure mean exponential growth here. look graph equation 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 (which obviously be, used x 1/50 ballpark estimate), see curve hits 0 y=0, (makes sense, exposures means 0% chance infected), approaches never reaches 1 INF. curve steeper lower number is, meaning marginal odds getting infected go much faster first exposures have. seem fit exponential growth means me, anything could say marginal odds getting virus exposures exhibits exponential *decay* model. case, isnt usually particularly meaningful talk exponential growth decay talking probabilities.

I pay enough attention college stats class idea make model viral load across multiple exposures taken account. guess would assume would take account viral load necessary infection, lifespan virus particle cause infection, time exposures, probably whole host things besides. understand enough say anything conclusive curves.

If information model using would like elaborate mean exponential growth context, would love hear it.

In case, thanks making curious enough remember stuff I'm paying way much learn. act like honor lose. people care regular citizens, stay office. yet another money flow north south.

Perhaps Italy turn *extremely* large gold reserves (second biggest reserves world) money begging 1000 euros *every single Dutch person, including babies elderly* (note: clear, *exclusively* Dutch contribution I'm talking about).

And open secret money going issues caused coronavirus, longstanding problems economies southern member states EU instead.

Did mention Italy's deaths per million 1.5 times higher Netherlands' deaths per million? hit *that* much harder, according numbers. people act like it’s fault lost jobs

I'm alarmed country's Coronavirus response similar reason.

We cannot solve SYSTEMIC FAILURE individual action. millions us Millennials (now 30s) *still* never gotten launch careers ""getting by"" decade. gotten worse.

The government response? Cut aid launch [crappy web AWFUL suggestions!

""Broadcast sound engineering technician""

SERIOUSLY????????????? fucking LEFT broadcasting industry 11 years FULL-TIME JOBS field. wages suuuuuuuuuper low. that's one *12* suggestions. 

Wow. /s Jesus Christ many mentally ill people thread. Covid hits blood. hits everything else. years decades recover, lucky enough recover. 

Wear mask. Social distancing. Wash hands. kind polite.  Hah, mentioned two herpesviruses retrovirus. like pointing people chickenpox is, fact, pox virus all, herpesvirus. explains dormant state.


But no. proof doesn’t point. But, proof either. I’m coronavirologist, iirc there’s nothing genome indicate ability. Definitely way HIV, requires special enzymes. story herpesviruses complicated, don’t yet understand latency works (to knowledge. Research obvs ongoing) hypothesized involve infection neuron herpesvirus, disables cell’s ability kill prevent viral replication time host becomes stressed, infection flares up.

Coronaviruses known large (possibly upper limit of) RNA genomes frequent recombination. makes weird things behave strangely. Take ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ John Oliver funny. get whoever pays continues so.

If ever conspiracy, would read cards saying one. 

A real investigative journalist would figure exact origins claims *that* would interesting know. 

Scientifically, difficult show 5G-towers *not* harm human health. mean do, right living near radio tower known cause cancer live ""far enough away"" risk small, *not* zero.

The 5G coronavirus conspiracy described fake conspiracy silence real discussions filling EM spectrum even more. Since nobody writes investigative journalism anymore, idea believe anymore, means disinformation agents won.

We ""freedom press"", nobody uses freedom. Actually though half east asia control virus well, think government using fear control (like revealing “oh son found gay bar patient.. hey girl next door, phone gps checked hostess bar, women happily sleep old men money).. virus real nothing. sure whether must kept inside long though follow guideline.

Published July 20, 2020 4:14 p.m. I’d rather die.... People say someone lives country masks became mandatory law stores public spaces, can't say I've noticed effect. Seeing people wearing masks reminds there's pandemic going careful. month ago, small resurgence cases motivated mask mandate, many people started drop masks go back old habits, virus completely gone.

EDIT: criticizing personnally way, held position (that masks may cause people less careful social distancing whole) while. if... test group unmitigated school openings area community spread..? watch results compare choices made schools communities. Suprise! train immune system even without vaccine you’ll likely fine catch Covid. see happening issue.

Whether reinfection infection lying dormant body many months reactivate.... many issues same. 

The question common be. reports exceptions rule first indicators widespread issue. 

Then timescale. quite possible immunity fades 2-3 months case could first many similar experiences. Quite months might needed possible confirm deny this. Netherlands virus gains stealth 95% time? Fuck 25 hour delay fetching comments.

I messaging 14 days [**2020-08-03 05:51:37 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-08-03%2005:51:37%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Ohhh boy, bet makes assload. You’re wrong. starting point absolutely makes difference exponential relationship. stronger person I. People like that, friends family, go 'do talk divisive issues with' list. Sad mask wearing pandemic considered divisive issue are. Theoretically could offset depending data collected, ie people went get tested checked found flu Wash hands. Wear mask. Follow advice health professionals. Social distance. Wash hands. kind others. continually produced vast amount antibody everything infects would big swollen lymph nodes. Lancet paper describes seroprevelance antibodies 5% asymptomatic 20% symptomatic x weeks. People retaining Spain definitely get reinfected. Replace Trump Fauci it’s still true. Fucker lied made pay insanely gouged mask costs result.

I don’t care people say. Fauci bad doctor. lied masks middle public health crisis. He’s different Trump. This. one year old. Since getting wear mask impossible (she'd tear off) iirc advice mask kids 3, kept away people. exception pediatrician visits need happen. sure that. People traveling forgetting keep social distance. Health officials also worried seems like common cold becoming common again, means people careless spring dampen among covid. funny certain idiots chose wearing mask ""asking much me"" part, hear people railing washing hands ""because gubment told to"". Mask wearing small investment, too, given alternatives, yet morons abound. agree body positivity/ Health Every Size movement quite damaging bizarre, wouldn’t say they’re level anti vaxxers. can’t spread obesity like would preventable disease, even kill people going large supermarket ... one wash products bring home? Trump needs stand trial genocide result gross neglegence towards people world. tradition passed since dawn time. answering question. get virus ahead surface contact. understand experts keep saying really happen. 

I'm along virus spread surfaces,or went hand wagging important. I'm asking experts keep saying spread via surfaces barely spread way telling us important cleaning hands surfaces are. contradictory information. Like said ""masks protect you"" ""medical professionals need masks protect themselves"". Isnt case majority infections asymptomatic anyway? 50k registered (sympomatic) cases Netherlands 1.5-3m infections total given serology results. People dont wear masks here, public transport. 

I support masks, dont get wrong, think social distancing, outside, hand washing help lot too. 

And link viral load severity still research topic. Might take long time concluded. Science slow, slow good. like, yeah, would understand vaccine case, cause well, side effects + bloated lack f trust science make it. masks, even N95 buy anyway, those. piece cotton face. wear reusable one time outside issues breathing. logical thing assume worst case scenario. Probably means stupid. see lot requirements there's way really enforce this. Clerks can't police face ding-dongs running amok. people know Venezuela claim people around take disease seriously medical system whatsoever live. think even cavalier people's confidence would reduced circumstances. can't say local nationwide feeling though. seems countries leaders great education science etc. getting much better reality tv show leaders. fucking work?!

Exactly. me, exactly picnic *before* recession (weird skill set). I'm screwed now.

When 1099 work ended, rare extension unemployment 1099ers (and $600/week) Godsend keeping afloat. ends next week, I'm highway financial ruin.

To avoid breaking sub ""rules"", let say white/educated/suburbanite male, used typically vote one political party. became extremely concerned. literally feel party **kill** (in literal sense). choice vote opposing party November who, believe, offers superior *Coronavirus* pandemic economic response. Please looking caloric burn rates high intensity exercise scale however many hrs per day joints break down. 

I need to, already know information. math works unless morbidly obese bone disease something joints handle enough exercise lose weight.

What's wrong brain? exercise way past shitty diet you’re adult job.

OK, guess whole life lives others hallucinations then.

Have fun delusional idiot, really worth talking point. Well, see, ^the ^^media ^^^is ^^^^biased ^^^^^and ^^^^^^therefore ^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^forget ^^^^^^^^^what ^^^^^^^^^^was ^^^^^^^^^^^that? BLM, Dr Fauci, China. Everyone know who, right?  Well yes amenities.

But also students normal prices person. Universities giving discounts normal tuition. colleges afraid whole bunch students defer go online

And actually, agree lot students families this. large percentage college networking...hell I’d say that’s half advantage going school like Harvard Brown. would pay full tuition getting half benefit? lived myself, read lot horror stories subs, I'm terrified friend whose live-in partner stop going see mom (whose exposure uncertain, even though friends otherwise safe). Like, gamble lives health family, even remote chance dying alone, someone needy wants see you? Jesus Christ. Yes, sucks, that's video calls for. ""But writing wall
Cried fresh cut old wound
Still bleeding, know
As done fair share reading
Like he'd never felt flames revolution
The young man's simple solution

Caligula's Horse - Inertia Weapon Wall Man want effective government.. anxiety, dude. keep saying science says otherwise. destination country may ask? dog? assume kids contagious even get virus can't give someone else. widely criticized though. we're really lucky maybe good end. Lots stimulus simultaneously screws oil/dirty tech, least US. I'd surprised EU stimulus provisions like either. 

We'll definitely prepared next pandemic, probably enforced international law that. infectious dose another term i've heard used, viral load? City Museum, Magic House, St Louis Zoo, Saint Louis Science Center, Butterfly House Botanical Gardens, Arch, Laura Ingalls Wilder Home (not exactly St. Louis, close-ish). Actually great city visit kids days aren’t middle national pandemic every teacher strikes, theres one teach, state shambles.

Just agree stop striking take away licenses retirement. balls. Like already said, it’s picking reinforcing bad habits. bad habits picks take many multiples hours later undo want label unemployed drains society. Clearly we're working cause unemployment living like kings.

I live relative's *luxury* double wide. Unemployment hella glamorous. Yes words, support democracy aligns opinion. I'm big fan Biden, think Voltaire right mindset iconic statement *""I disapprove say, defend death right say it""*. Social contract right obligation. know distributor tried selling NYC hospital 4 months ago nurse called begging N95 masks, even few. getting touch purchasing manager - “sorry, we’re buying we’ll gladly take donations.” another distributor know contract major city refused take order masks price went slightly, still 1/5th price open market. finally sold couple weeks ago went straight Florida. going go home, they’re gonna get it

I'm glad kids 6-17 live anyone else could get sick then. /s Wait minute. read history avoid repeating it? kind liberal? think would best interest nation send anti-maskers island let’s chips fall may. didn’t fiancée would list. Plus I’m 26 healthy, exactly group need most. Apparently applies people areas going Tokyo well.

But, given Tokyo hot spot country, entire campaign moronic right now. Florida, places I've lived central air without would awful.

Conversely, almost 0 places lived Montana air conditioning all. Minimal. usually get 40% battery 9pm, since installing tracing app, battery around 35% 9pm pretty sure Universities still charging normal prices. Students still meet professors, lessons, etc. Maybe: 'We invested much campus pool, lawn, student rec room, indoor Sauna, amenities want waste it'?? Please name last deadly global coronavirus pandemic. I'll wait here. Bad enough trying equate novel coronavirus influenza; brought Bubonic plague argument - bacterial infection. None pathogens act same. stated nothing personal wishful thinking means assuage subconscious visceral fear. feeling particularly acerbic I'd dismiss straw man argument mansplaining. ""It disappear. Eventually I'll right."" Maybe. Maybe not. Anti-intellectuals stay lane. precedent, outcome described purely conjecture based leaps assumption. provided material proof statements. linked unlinkable. precedent. NOVEL coronavirus. Never seen planet. could anyone know might ""tend"" happen ""generally"" happen. That's whats damn difficult wrap human mind around. That's thousands minds trying make sense unprecedented event - feel powerful control something absolutely control ability predict outcome of. Bottom line - simply know going happen. Scientists predict millions die though. Law percentages see that. 600,000. month 4 scientists HOPE run course 24 months. Focus word ""hope"" sentence. Maybe will. Maybe wont. We. Don't. Know. zero basis even begin state authority follow pattern tendency influenza pandemic bacterial pandemic. NOVEL coronavirus pandemic. come name last one yet? False. reached conclusion believing told based false studies instead applying critical thinking. Exactly point.

Lol. “Critical thinking”. 

Please looking caloric burn rates high intensity exercise scale however many hrs per day joints break down. compare hamburgers ice cream. exercise way past shitty diet you’re adult job. don’t enough hrs day don’t caloric needs growing teen. like middle school level exercise science here. Check revised, combined statement. CRITICAL qualification. Everytime I've sarcastic without /s I've downvoted lol. Personally add /s feels like telling really good joke explain afterwards sure Trump "" made covid great again"". Man like theres pandemic going something.

If could wear facemasks cut huge % cases. Like using leeches theraputically except instead leeches ants instead treatment neglect. guy can’t even do/say “right thing” without making racist Field hospitals close ICU equivalent. Sue them! That's best response. put public danger. Oh thank gods finally talked Melbourne seeing second wave worst first one finally premier decided masks necessary.
Otherwise word street infection rate low compared countries dont need wear masks doesnt help sick. America: Open schools!! neck woods Publix pretty good too. I'm sick tired hearing ""we can't US $BS"".

That's reverse white supremacy malicious. top argument progress used reactionaries. it! accordance ""*rules*"" sub, simply say:

The pandemic response communities follow depend elected officials select. happen voice democratic process 104 days. would kindly suggest dissatisfied city, state, ^*cough* country, consider exercising option.

There's doubt country's high case growth indicates room improvement. many missing newscast. True... 

Wait, ENTERING Tokyo? superintendent expect different 3 weeks? Strikes rather gutless move. Hi, I’m excited vaccine hopefully roll out.!!:) why, first, saying 18 months vaccine? relatively easier thought modify all? perfectly stupid thing say... live south, without AC get mid 90s inside. know central AC broke I've use window units bedrooms afford get replaced. ""Just use AC"" lmao, many elderly people would fucking die heat virus 
 
Also confirm poor expensive, though agree idea many people stupid know use them. That's bit ridiculous. problem ultimate goal really run less tests, goal get results less time. example could take almost twice long run 6 tests two rounds run 8 tests one round. Keep reading fake Facebook stories, sound like fool. Right-wing Twitter mainly bots trolls. amount fake/bot anti-mask accounts dwarfs amount real ones. science argues effectiveness masks? dumb science doesn’t count? They'll claim joking necessary. someone household tests positive mark everyone lives household positive. Skip testing, quarantine all, contact trace all. That's definition bubble, people generally buying houses flip like 2008, they're generally buying live in. lower interest rates make higher prices affordable. correct rental market may crash though, plus job loss recession could affect housing market eventually Florida, stupid shit hole world. indeed, millions renter evitced, millions mortgages left unpaid, millions repossessions, go again. I'll probably drown ocean something. else ya hell read this, that's funny man! keep close tab Hong Kong specific policies know bad. There's photos came yesterday showing testing capacity limit. top one imported asymptomatic carrier Fuzhou today Hong Kong, apparently entered mainland via illegal channels avoid outbreak Hong Kong. Public Security Bureau says 12 month prison Hong Kong resident illegally entering mainland 2-7 years people smugglers caught.

I hear murmurs already Hong Kong request support mainland testing capacity. Unless they're right IFR really 0.002%, everyone's mind change 2 months now. already baked in.  feel like sending wrong message. don’t understand, accepted many kids infected would pointless keep tested positive school? Seems way safe Florida kids contact anybody kids. That’s fucked up. That's literally every fucking vaccine does. fuck headline. Damn, we're still July works school starts next week. far 4 quit - including science nursing teacher. There, quoted yourself. pretty disappointing still fail see it.

Let break mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet*

Masks way making people feel *little* better, *blocks 1 droplet*. saying this, undermining effectiveness masks. kind making fun ""healthy"" people wearing it.
 it’s providing perfect protection people think is.""*

Nobody looking expecting PERFECT protection. 6 feet physical distancing perfect distance, washing hands perfect solution, still place. Heck, even N95 provide perfect protection, medical personnel still wear it. However, people looking expecting every additional measures increase protection regardless perfect one. said pretty much meant since masks provide PERFECT, 100% protection, general public bother. *""Don't Let Perfect Enemy often, unintended consequences""*

By saying this, pretty much trying scare discourage ""healthy"" people wearing masks. unintended consequence bad, doubt would ever reversed mask stance April.

In nutshell, quote pretty much saying masks much might actually backfire (increase chance infection, false), ""healthy"" people bother.

I understand shortage masks, lying undermining effectiveness masks public messed up. could told people wear sort face coverings like April. even thought wearing bandana February ""hostility"" towards mask wearers.

Don't get wrong, moment, still think Fauci good guy. F'ed big time one. boggles mind annoys end people still put pedestal worship like hero. political health authorities/figures F'ed up. U.S. pandemic response overall abysmal. * Elephant Party trying make companies immune lawsuits. What's weird dumbidees thing kind new world order plot. like wearing mask satanic ritual.

""If get us wear masks""

Yeah, ""they"" got everyone wear pants. mean... evidence covid spread via airborne transmission, meaning wiping things won’t prevent spread. close contact extended periods increase spread, mask/no mask, washed hands/unwashed, doesn’t matter turns spread airborne transmission droplet. world? play. Lol. Easier championship tough risks. Would interesting primaries started now. still doubt Yang would won, bet platform get media ""haha free money"" biased treatment right now. Hmm depends. beaches people exercising don’t. good majority even walking streets Whoops.

Literally CDC USPHS said it. New Englanders always seemed fairly civically-minded me. Seattle. Everyone wears mask they’re around others. careful half mask.

There's lot shit put silicone, namely alcohol. Use Lysol wipe. since long since gone, look ""alcohol free respirator wipes"" - they're basically mild disinfectant wipes. expensive AF 3M ones ($40/50) ton cheaper ones.

You need regularly clean outside. Like said, gloves. need thoroughly clean it, IIRC instructions call dilute bleach solution. Uhhh... anybody got tl;dr this? freedom speech integral democratic systems.

Exactly, like DeSantis, like him, one does, freedom speech integral nation's stability

Can fathom mess that'd happen shut up? think, MAGA supporters would literally riot streets saw shit-show BLM ""supporters"" started looting. want people suffer more, future voices stifled? guys first Good point. we've uneventful cool summer far I've literally left min. wage shit job sobbing can't believe life college graduate America. frank. literally said mask WORSE nothing would touch face more, ""trained"" use it, etc.

It obviously stupid obviously correct wear mask then. 

""Listen scientists"" treated like religion, science almost entirely inexact full unknowns, scientists science based organizations lie play politics constantly. 

Throwing around ""its science stupid"" treating religious gospel least undermining science anything is. ""Right think"" said. even read comment? don’t even believe opening schools, shouldn’t pretend don’t provide lot kids. It’s sad let pandemic get point deny kids critical service save lives equivalence worst.

And moments ago previous comment jumped right Godwin's Law: modern day Nazi Germany.

The lack self-awareness astounding. :v happening inmates test positive? see articles like time, never follow up. many end Critical Dying? suspect see 90% reddit stop wearing mask now. Creep history want science engineer guy. Engineer stories like. Also remember argument. said something stupid, corrected started crying trying attack personally. honestly care call peasant. intelligent enough opinion matter me. ... insurance cover Epidemiological Bingo worst prizes. big thing driving Canadian immigration choices wanting people remain Canadians got here. many people getting discouraged first couple years leaving. may skilled - maybe job short people, maybe english/French wasn’t good - didn’t really integrate make friends, might older openness younger people accept life New Canadian. 

So lot weighted towards already spending quite lot time Canada already, already language skills, skills need. DeSantis you? remember video link? i'm fascinated really dumb people love watch rant haha feel awful making near min wage, workers can’t expected get housing food, much less cobble enough together emergency fund. making mid/upper five figures low six figures, zero sympathy runs out. emergency fund built far know rapid tests less accurate? PCR nasal swabs much accurate standard countries using *laughs florida* full quote just... honestly can't say got virus basically home bound. mean thing went Orlando vacation sudden came home sick.""

So homebound. vacationing. Fucking idiots. y’all get upvote making smile heartbreaking time America. Lmao, no, insufferable human 😒 errm, 1, bit housing bubble... 23 million Americans evicted, means one paying rent millions mortgaged properties, properties mortgaged express profiteering renters, millions small 2nd 3rd mortgage owners able mortgages... funny works think it, isnt it. vaccine vaccine distributed public en masse two different things. don’t, lose advertising schools affect funding. gives fuck happens kids? never denied point. point op thread stated soon see effects opening isnt case since Universal open month. really sure difficult understand statement. Whether cases directly related opening yet confirmed soon cases related opening. Lol highly doubt publicity stunt.  Whoa, what's next? gonna mop floors? 😂

I can't argue single point made. 

I think wrong foot.

Have good evening, sir 👍 Please make reality. Umm...health insurance tied job major problem. bad US universal health coverage, would make lot simpler teachers planning quitting fall. I'd advocate tripled, agreed. hire people. Everyone expendable work company dont matter are. Gov. Mike Parson ~ They’re lowest risk possible get COVID-19 — will, go school — they’re going hospitals, they’re going sit doctors’ offices. They’re going go home, they’re gonna get it, proves way look science it.”



ScIeNcE! /s give people (not comment's author) much credit. agree, indeed good, brief description viruses work.

And longer single tweet. Again, much credit. longer comment people check out.

Idiocracy popcorn flick anymore fellas, we're living it. see social media. Wuhan horrendous place I’ve seen whole pandemic. caught guard northern Italy New York Madrid weeks unmitigated transmission lockdowns. numbers match anywhere else world that.

Edit: I’m taking anything away China’s lockdown. think tremendous job eventually took corona seriously. happened totally fucked everything supports except state numbers Small base large customers inaccurate story father fine. needs removed moderators. Sadly, KU doctor point much use getting tested. 3 weeks since exposed 2.5 weeks ago chest tightness persisted week ""symptom"" could anxiety. Even comes back positive it, passed worst simplest explanation believe literal magic. Fuck it, give prizes. Even Journalism prize research paper. Personally, kids I’d rather keep safe possible risk called “racist,” send back school chances infection. mean, pulling bootstraps literally defies laws physics. I'm sure absence boots really key :). got food poisoning last week, eating day-old 7-Eleven prepared raw tuna poke. little brown figured day old ate anyway. reviewing signs symptoms think might staph aureus. answer makes sense got sick; eaten fresh staph aureus bacteria, wouldn’t gotten sick - add day fridge bacteria multiplied 💥food poisoning claim school board officials get great pay offices remodeled almost yearly half schools county (FL) AC mold article makes sound like now. Said hospital 3 weeks ""was on"" ventilator 2 weeks. Holy hell, finally happened. 
Please wear mask. title evil. lockdown causing deaths. virus is. I’m basing article read years ago. don’t notice money spend it. effective stimulus even though weren’t politically popular people didn’t notice money like stimulus checks.  sarcasm breath fresh air. you’re California began reopening May 18, almost week half protests there. 

So no, nice try. testing trends case trends. saying hopeful also know dip cases went know lag. Yeah, I'm really sure priority assigned. Seniors highest risk, course, generally high priority - first responders younger people comorbidities I'm really sure ""should"" work. ID50, minimum infectious dose 50% population Incivility, point OP relying tool simply work? Amazing. Seriously. guy fine now. story gets posted least 3 times day last two weeks. 

Also, son went party 3 weeks showed symptoms. sure possible. 

Most importantly, happy hear John fine. Vitamin D, healthy eating, exercise. Great article. always sad note conversing Westerners (mostly US) much know way life aware mine. friends talk even believed China behind BLM anti-mask movement, reason.

They like repeat tired meme Chinese people always retort ""You understand China"" response criticism country, true. really don't.  Change DeSantis DeathSantence. Glad alone thinking immediately reading post title. drink one Bud Light barely feel thing. Shotgun 18 pack get super fucked up. 

Boom, anti-maskers understand it. Good thing even matter say.

Now know us common sense power protect ourselves, want wear masks become annoying background static natural selection deal accordingly. net hundred bucks pay probably thousands debt basically putting money bank. happened murder hornets? get murder hornets? point confusion February excuse wear mask now. agree initial response wasn’t good got things wrong. people can’t understand experts need time understand new virus, **are** dumb. It’s legitimate excuse shitty actions today. think lost brain cells looking sub dirtbag governor. Yeah sources statement. frankly seems little hard believe - infectious dose probably matters thing does. Replicating basically do. They're essentially nanobots gone wrong. driving alcohol breath good thing ever heard refugees asylum seekers? new concept. Speak anyone flee country due fucked things control over. Seeing american refugees trip may inevitable point. 

Theyre competing millions Hong Kongers fleeing too. stayed fight problem. Things far complicated. Nothing sent anywhere. clearly understand concept decentralised app is.

Everyone's device private, encrypted list IDs people they've contact last 14 days. get positive test, they're given 6 digit code. put app, send request notify everyone phone's list someone tested positive.

No personal data stored server. done decryption server side, storage.

The code available online. open source. literally look all. money coming from? haggling austerity measures years, there’s €1.8 trillion available? much nicer am. angry keep seeing neighbors people over. truly think problem people believe friend can’t possibly Covid strangers Covid. wear mask store prevent getting stranger, keep get togethers friends family.   personal experience drive testing (WA, King County) wear mask, nurse gives new mask, roll window, change mask, pull healthcare worker speak crack window. talked administering swab test.

So mask best prepared swap. Yes bear watching long stays treatable Paracetamol think people put off. Here, think talking 

From fact alot people sub, left leaning, still think China communist country, really reinforce information asymmetry gap Chinese Americans, entire West. 

I seen video Aussie came China thinking military state......After came, realized could walk beer street Shenzhen nothing would happen him.

It's good read, someone lived 10+ year U.S. China, think generally Chinese knows America American knows China.

But take article face value, mean, far know, taxi drivers Beijing know electoral votes swing states determines presidential election. Asymptomatic transmission mainstream news since late January.

Also imply masks effective healthy people March 8th 60 Minutes ""…There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.* literally needs happen us get control thing trump issue national mask mandate, refuses? Lunacy. idea mask keep second wave happening though. say true, I'm disappointed her

Like C'mon February anymore came China, not? Careful there, government could watching us right 

*flashbacks people getting arrested saying something internet* Waal parent. sayin. check camp send kids? Great job Finland.  countries universal public plan everyone ability purchase additional insurance specific specialist options. difference plan, would close already medicaid (in TONS doctors even accept it). healthcare plan universal would worry doctors accepting even supplemental insurance. heard happened Germany, tried limited reopening? reclose schools many areas virus. regions actually used legislation prohibit municipal internet.

To me, even close system law meant for. course possible, evidence it, far know still evidence viral dose affecting symptoms (no one's posted here). Maybe affect hosts immune system general health probably bigger impact disease progression. Also, ordering infected people senior care facilities. I'm still waiting help come ""essential"" workers. Oh neat got tiny ass check 5 months ago, cool. forcing us work hazardous conditions others get sent home making 2 3x make. Seems real fucking fair, would made 12 grand fired ass. I'd phone used Bluetooth proximity matching given HSE test positive people matched recently get warning

Not this, actually *have* report test positive either, report nobody knows are.

When get positive result, HSE give 6 digit code. put app, it'll send notification everyone contact saying **someone** close contacy diagnosed. use code though, want report it, to. Water wet. They've saying whole time. Stop karmawhoring. continue reclose bars restaurants probably states...  growing portion selfish pricks society continue fuck things everyone else  spouse, WTF. Disney visitor security science

[Oh people please stop perpetuating Disney God CDC lists transmission little risk, family almost always doesit anyways abundance caution. Especially place low mask compliance. could scientist tell antimaskers holding hand fire lighter burn you. Unfortunately, anti maskers still hold hands fire. Why? don’t want told do. Simple. don’t give fuck anyone else. Control freak narcissistic assholes. important reason downplayed would mandate new OSHA guidelines. would cost employers money. Reality citizens taking virus issue seriously botched quarantine implementations lead increase cases. problem. Another social shortcut use watching facial expression clue whether need respond back someone. instance, I'm third ""sorry, hear you,"" repeat see smile, smile back nod head. could tell making joke expecting reply. point give trying understand. Unfortunately, can't tell someone smiling slight smile wear mask.

They solution, requires person wearing one masks clear window front. see widely adopted anytime soon. delay immune response body starts fighting it. Unmitigated exponential growth means larger dose makes far imbedded infection time body starts fighting it. Covid particularly long one think 4 days minimum Yeeeep got banned one mentioned first time commented lol stop ""protesting"" start forcing people out. votes, strongly worded letters.. action. Immoral parties cash pot getting infected? 

Let's honest large majority Americans good people sensible enough respect laws. loved travelling there. can't screen people right now. must defend own.

What's happening south bit terrifying. Aint better trump. Im Philippines. dont even mass testing national.budget loans meant fighting thr virus magically disappearing. Right Philippine citizens silenced, currently trying kill freedom speech letting cases increase ten times. joke, came back Japan auby uncle asked ""survived"" 3 weeks. ""You mean vending machines everywhere, better public transportation, surrounded lovely school faculty awesome students blast spending time with?""

You'd thought spit face reaction.... makes feel better dont miss it, f***ings awful moment that's going on! 😅 Absolutely false. get PUA qualify UI odd people think person time nothing

A lot people want babysitting. never admit it, maybe even want perfectly sound reasons, like they're stuck hard place needing work needing babysitting.

But imo that's say society failed person, make decision, gov't pitting citizens citizens, parents vs. teachers, impossible situation. That’s really known far, definitely lot factors. others pointed out, certain scenarios infection happen lot easier, like singing loudly crowded room without fresh air long time. maybe one partner knew he/she contact infected person, takes precautions distance even tested feeling sick themselves. time infections happen supposed quite short, typically day day beginning symptoms. mean that's hardly surprising happened, beginning virus ""wear mask!"", ""no don't!"", ""don't take ibuprofen!"", ""nah that'a fine!"", ""oh shit not!"", ""oh fine."", etc.

Most people know way science works, stumble around hypotheses based common sense update data comes in. lay person saw whole Jan-Feb boogaloo, might seem ridiculous follow rules.

So prance around saying obvious everyone start. would simply defend *now*, since like couple months ago, pretty clear masks make difference. pregnant Disney world (not choice - parents booked trip kids knew pregnant) threw even done, three cast members front absorbent powder, broom, bottle water me. 

I even fucking like Disney, really feel like princess. Interesting waited Trump pro mask really since possibility another virus coming time, wore mask time, would less likely get virus ever? Classic north VS dirty old poor south narrative, move along. living 2008 anymore, kind.

Edit: classic economic fallacy promoted Dutch conservative right likes. won't, appears might get lucky Oxford may bail us situation (if vaccine indeed track produced September, claim). 

We learn thing this, people still think virus hoax, government look excuses send another stimulus check, people ignore weak social safety nets. Business usual continue. . . 

...unless Oxford runs road blocks and/or vaccine able distributed large numbers. instance, holy crap we're headed rough times. Sounds like Idaho forgot rest country exists. agree .... used dangerous manner!
Don’t open worms. still long way away. Many things go wrong still. Shame, Foucault primarily examined environment scientific discourse emerges. memory serves correctly ideas focused identity formed scientific discourse. example, prevalence ""race science"" 1600s WW2 ""empirically"" presented means forming race distinction superiority, perpetuated scholars like Arthur de Gobineau Pieter Camper (like De Caprio's character Django Unchained).


Disclaimer: mean support post-truth, wear damn mask. distinction theorists valid points others much. DeSantis like MiniTrump... Trump stopped evil Chinese bringing virus US.. saved millions lives... DeSantis stopped evil NYers bringing virus FL..

And... that’s last effective thing did.. Sounds like leveraged. Good thing assets sell need to.

No, misunderstood FB rumors. like get possibly losing parent Covid knowing gave parent Covid? Australia's also open source.

It sounds like Ireland's worked well marketing/political info rather technological ability thought common sense wear mask kind respiratory disease outbreaks. far know, Oxford vaccine mass produced British/Swedish company AstraZeneca who‘s CEO Pascal Soriot announced vaccine sold production cost AstraZeneca make profit vaccine. Asymptomatic transmission already mainstream news late January. Calling new information April another lie. Tell able attend person, ask site they'll streaming wedding on. take ""it streamed"" answer, 21st century. Liberal ideas relative truth

Cities counties running space morgues today tragically suffer terribly August even September, even shut today. every week don't, much worse.

I honestly think country may already past equivalent point NYC shut down. risk populace less healthcare capacity, may already track suffer worse did. 

I think we've actually community world bad already shut down, least one honest data. Brazil probably past point several regions, they're barely testing attempting obfuscate data besides. ah, good choice Yeah I’ve willing meet 3 people total outside far apart last 4 months. I’m less thrilled sent back work school librarian fall I’m confined space hundreds kids every day none windows open. give 3-4 weeks find parents send sick exposed kids school end back online. optimistic outline us make Halloween.

have americans got much cash available keep housing market buoyant? even without mass's renters covering mortgage costs.

so many questions... many unknowns, much strife... much opportunity banks screw everyone...so many Covid infections happen tent cities explode. Here. paywall, article posted let know think. Frankly speaking think similar situation exist US/SK, tho less informed matter.  Why'd get tagged misleading title? seems accurately summarize linked growing body evidence suggests opposite also true. **wearing mask might protect you, too**. **But get virus in, get little in**. likely get what's called asymptomatic infection symptoms - mild infection.

Well takes brain understand science know wear mask, mean without science people even believe washing hands (tbf mostly medieval Europe, dude gets credit inventing hand washing even though pretty much everyone ancient civilization would like, shit bro, digress)

[Them dawgs hell debate really almost Japan said fuck it, still want Olympics, getting outbreak. Arizona Asia, except everyone wore masks culture. Hell correlation.

I believe ""new studies"" stuff overblown. Folks lot theories COVID-19 spread much mask-wearing countries, think advice would definitive middle pandemic.

By way, I'm mask wearer beginning simple argument protection better protection. Also, masks cool. Gangsters, superheroes, surgeons wear masks. Even Texas delayed high school football. Texas. seeing upwards 45k games happen. Football life here. hell Florida doing? Rick flair like 65 wrestling like 30 years ago. looks 65 like different human being. doesn’t watch sports tho. He’s one guys pretends watch sports.  yeah, looks great mustache twirling evil monopoly men surface. soon think one goddamn second becomes obvious going work think will. 

The kids go back school within first couple weeks outbreaks, means parents can't use schools daycares anyway. 

Or get sick, can't go back work making widgets slave wages corporate overlords continue buying yachts whatnot anyway. 

The economy going boom pushing kids back school. Nobody able afford charter schools lose jobs take time deal sick kids/selves/bury Grandma, etc.

It's going unnecessary suffering economy crashes burns anyway nobody go Disney buy latest iPad whole family sick jobless drowning medical debt. Oopsies doodles.

IsItBullshit: USA cases COVID19 purely due widespread testing available?

Theur findings study make claims (because without hard data, 'science' opinion) published JAMA - Journal American Medical Association - going cited like wildfire.

Wearing mask good before, there's really excuse. Granny Clampett M.ountain D.octor 6th grade graduate brain surgeon Jethro Bodine assured Covid-19 Faux Flu conspiracy make President Jefferson Davis look bad. know think make vax, fund vax, profit vax take it, LEAD EXAMPLE. allow us wait see works. create it, able first ones test it. profit it, ones first test it.  majority US kind mask mandate now. Stop virtue signalling. There’s decent argument made cure worse disease. Estimates 35k people miss early detection cancer couldn’t get see doctor, suicides massively up, child abuse, domestic violence, addiction, overdose, drastically. lady work with, 10 years sober, relapsed lockdown. It’s heart breaking. It’s black white full lockdown goes away. epi husband says can’t. I've heard claims ambulances waiting hours hospitals drop patients article.

It would interesting people making claims could get photo video proof ambulances lined up. couple weeks ago stores terrible compliance, governor finally allowed mask order things changed. stores signs saying masks required order governor. think really helps businesses support elected officials like order enforce order. Mask compliance seems peak 5 15. lot masks near beach lot masks sticks. Good behavior between. True, easy replace workforce, especially they're skilled way. That's also unions work; easier give demands many fire everyone re-hire train new people. 

Also, sucks bad enough people get tired it, want work first place. pretty dire straits while, lost hours job completely losing others due covid, turned two offers asked supported workers like answer. Generally yes, works infectious pathogens like influenza. still affect even tiny doses higher initial dose still generally predicts worse disease outcomes. infectious dose virus causing COVID-19 determined yet likely never requires exposing people increasingly high doses pathogen see happens. However, animal tests give indication SARS MERS higher initial dose predicted worse outcomes animals.  Probably many think since looks like state turning blue. already purple look way congressional delegation split middle. Split Senate seats slim 5-4 House delegation majority GOP.

Also, Trump's approval rating Arizona 45% versus 54% disapproval. Biden beats Trump 50% 43% 7% still undecided. best friend (who master’s public health) lived NZ year facing getting sent back US visa expires it’s nearly simple accepting people essential workers Yeah, ""non-related covid deaths"" old people homes skyrocketed too. one diverse virus comes symptoms affects literally entire body, lot deaths could related would never know. Four members family got one got respiratory problems, others got different problems. I'd personally hate see future take phone times. would one step away actual microchips. company first require masks? Costco? WOOOOOOOOO!!!! virus bring Nature Boy! 1) “according CDC.” single study, marked limitations, published CDC’s journal website. site specifically says articles may representative CDC’s official position.

2) influenza, little evidence aerosol spread. It’s largely respiratory droplet spread. SARS-COV2 mounting evidence aerosol spread. 

3) conveniently left sentence wall quotes: However, hand hygiene, face masks might able reduce transmission infections therefore value influenza pandemic healthcare resources stretched. There's methods work car windshields prevent fogging, I'd imagine might help too. common one rubbing area dish soap water rubbing off. believe shaving gel/foam actually best method. unlikely. Researchers control factors like age using statistics. Feel free look study read Methods section learn more. personally took job, medical leads scientific sources counseling said go Plan A, telling likely would chosen Plan B instead would magically known?

Go home Captain Hindsight, even tell really Jennifer Love Hewitt. Yeah he's gotta speak language people get listen. (Although comments I'm sure worked well.) Economies scale fam.

I've moved probably pallets worth 3M masks Made Korea Singapore. ship one time, cheaper gets. Bring country free trade agreement US ship 3M cases. Customs give fuck. Kushner's stooges notice bringing cases *the popular* N95 models over.

It huge pain ass though. DHL FedEx raking in. Plus, eventually places I'm buying run too. I'm back square one. don’t see open precautions would bad thing. take precautions known time, continue adjust info becomes available, could easily keep things slower pace still better economy what’s happening now. 

It’s fantasy, though. many people refuse anything suggested, many refusing reason suggested. victims seem get much attention. Haha, check grammar write? stupid get something simple right first time? brag supposed intellect, yet fail basic communication. type like stroke.  even close. Deaths per capita still bottom 7 U.S. states.  122 total deaths.  numbers shot near zero long time, really direction go.  free antibody testing May numbers miniscule.  virus arrived yet.

The hospitals overrun people far healthier states.  Boise mask requirement people follow.  racist weirdos mostly California imports days.  They're pissed nobody told Boise fairly progressive.

If family member friend dies, might get bit upset 

If die, GUYS TELL THIS!!?? PROTECT SOMETHING PREVENT THIS!!??? I'M DYING FAULT!!!??? WANT DIE!!! I've trying explain people never believe dosage matters Agreed. thing tends happen ABC Australia. everyone responds differently trauma Based see recently, close damn Disney world again, they? I'm sorry loss. I've give friends attitude/politics, one hand, good purge negative influences life... other, sucks lose someone connection with. Additional I've definetly thinking things differently wondering others same. hard tell Karen videos anti-mask stuff going around represents large population gets posted internet. Meanwhile America practically disown brother refuses wear mask despite working restaurant dad -- visits weekly, severely high risk.

Can't bothered wear mask fathers sake. longer welcome father's house, I'm asshole banning him. Um, Pacific NW sure hell did.  school teacher? best ELI5 two concepts I've seen last 4 months.

Science politics separate Dr. Faucis job REQUIRES tightrope walk areas. oik, guess everything going ok then... sit back relax. youre 100% honest. selective options covid related issues. Check enough youll get check. thats worse case scenario, still believe something would get worked came that. This. would Facebook something good Good luck! hope negative! go test? Netherlands somewhere else? That's better dexamethasone! Masks political issue US... dumb. DNA. Lots funny jokes fat dumb Americans here. ashamed countrymen much amused them.

I think thing consider first time relatively short history faced existential threat like pandemic intense news cycle. Forget 1918, think post-911. different country quaint days Bill Clinton Seinfeld. past, government used considerably ephemeral threats - fear war terrorism - affect policy changes.

There political upside President institute mask requirement. Democrats hail decision good late, Republicans whine liberty made 'right'.

For me, American grew life overseas Europe, dumbfounding. ""Wear mask get sick."" need government tell this, sure would LIKE government tell people this. want enforced? Absolutely. government sends unmarked military police Portland graffiti, think spare little muscle safety security citizens. provided ""protection"" serious effects virus flu vaccine does. stop people getting it, greatly reduced risk infected person becoming seriously unwell. preventing virus able replicate. people think smart dumb realize stupid are. 🖖😷 Finally, sheeple awakened began understand wearing pants social construct, enforced us oppressive left. SHEEPLE RISE!  sure account 44% taxes to. However average higher salaries Switzerland also pay WAY less taxes U.S. 

When account healthcare &amp; social care (so compare salaries similar healthcare plan) U.S. salaries looking worse western countries. suppose assumption cases aren’t evenly distributed. Since it’s transmissible, one family member chances high rest family especially sitting car together (aka social distancing). case family tested positive, since entire family exposed whether one member positive, response would entire family self isolate. That's thing perfect reduction transmission zero effect. am

From POV sentiment exists movies. I'm understanding correctly, even someone wears mask low amounts virus body, easily explode numbers contracted - meaning get quick sick. point mask hopefully low enough viral dose fight propagates? misunderstanding? strict policy removing post say gonna die. Hospitals mask zones law. rest left people decide own. Agreed. man warmth depth twat. wife brought back furlough, things looking like they’re going close companies already made clear it’ll sucks suck... right federal benefits end Let’s face it, first time US government public said ‘we don’t give fuck kids’. Sandy Hook shooting made loud clear.  I'm confused. 

Above seem saying would use today, I'm taking form advocacy-- implying people feel comfortable same.

But seem saying someday, lot time review, trust it-- implying trust others trust audits complete.

Sorry I'm misunderstanding you, I'm getting mixed messages pretty clear: many eyes make bugs shallow, still got wait eyes finish job.

Regarding maintenance, yeah. Going take gather trust things like update cadence signing key management. again, track record I'd pretty worried gained serious traction. No. Made title slightly baseline patients COVID-19 treatment group (n=86) control group (n=86) symptoms CSS faced acute respiratory failure. Treated patients 79% higher likelihood reaching primary outcome (HR: 1.8; 95% CI 1.2 2.7) (7 days earlier), 65% less mortality (HR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.19 0.65) 71% less invasive mechanical ventilation (HR: 0.29; 95% CI 0.14 0.65). Treatment effects remained constant confounding sensitivity analyses.  strategy involving course high-dose methylprednisolone, followed tocilizumab needed, may accelerate respiratory recovery, lower hospital mortality reduce likelihood invasive mechanical ventilation COVID-19-associated CSS.

Apparently recovery around 80%? metrics? impeached! lot mask wearing allergies (particularly spring early summer). biggest investor, Fidelity, phoned Boston said WTF idiots doing?  local conversation divided expect. larger cities mostly people worried response virus, masking trying take care other. local leadership put place mask orders areas city/county level. 

Outside cities, see news. Refusal accept virus real thing, refusal wear masks sorts Q-anon conspiracy nonsense. problem line sane insane clear cut.

I'm dual US-Canadian citizen. wanted head back Canada 2016 damn sure Trump wins November.  still possible never vaccine, take years. I'd really disagree even facebook friend friend sort degree trust (enough trust seen ""friend"" theirs).

Using bar/pub example. people talk might pay attention to, might even call sort friend never invite wedding BBQ even. facebook friends like guy pub, they're real friend still degree trust. 

Then people want talk want seen talking to. people friends facebook matter what, trust. happens politicians owned campaign finance big business ultra rich. Likely Visa arrival Visa. Thanks!

Suddenly, attempt upset rioters, health officials government officials started claiming virus doesn’t spread outdoors, matter social distance not. 

So America view anything going outside thing spread virus. 

And can’t blame them. That’s told. 

Now contact tracers aren’t allowed ask riots, riots “officially” didn’t spread virus. There’s putting genie back bottle. can’t point explosion cases riots proof need social distance outdoors data purposely manipulated look like can’t spread outdoors. elected official ignorant enough go record saying this...maybe surprise me, does. He’s obviously willing sacrifice lives educators, total disregard staff takes run schools, parents children, coworkers. one blatant example one’s life mattering, economy threatened.

True. Looks like they're cashing chips in. wear condoms? seatbelts? dog shits pick bare hands bag? ignorant. Would accept seatbelt better seatbelt? seatbelt made yarn? 

Since masks supposedly big deal, let's treat like big deal. Specify mask, one wear it, one wear it, pass legislation enforce mask wearing. Except didn't. US strain European one.

You believe pandemic hoax? know pandemic real sister got real sick getting airplane. knocked two weeks coughing another week top that. spent three weeks already recovery. tested positive COVID19 hospital tells disease real.

After hearing horror stories Walmart employees getting threatened guns pretty aprehensive going work - really surprised easy went. said, ""I'm sorry, can't serve without mask""; people ran car get one. people wanted buy one gave one let pay - unfortunately free ones give out. people stretched thier shirt thier face, I'm like ""eh, sure allow started it."" 

Overall, snide comments checkout, atomic Karens. like 10-15% people wearing masks people seem pretty much board.

Also I'm doctor know lots doctors. working covid unit since march even going look numbers then?

FEWER cases today 7 days ago. Probably garbage article.  That's pathetic, though, literally takes two guys (trump pence mostly trump) saying ""I guess masks pretty OK. Whatever"" dipshits finally put I'm getting worldview critical thinking. Try sometime, like it. would need ""separate conversation"" literal article entire thread mentions exact point I'm making. even read sure, landlords need receive income rent cover expenses, cost mortgages, building maintenance property taxes.** That's advocates arguing federal assistance help renters afford bills, continuing $600 weekly unemployment benefits added varying state unemployment payouts.  wrong, despite downvotes. people were/are passively incredibly unaware economic shitstorm already baked cake next major recession hit. Federal Reserve destroyed economy manipulating markets 20+ years causing massively mispriced assets, distortions, inflation (not measured, measurements properly account things average people spend vast majority monthly expenses on, instead prioritizing every years bit technology, deflationary definition, TVs). real inflation rate average person well 10% would say, hide prioritizing TVs, depending oil market they'll promote one measurement another.

I disagree solutions. real solution immediate 75% cut military spending, bringing troops home, foreign bases abandoned, set good defensive military rather waste money aircraft carriers (and way better ones...) rest world combined, two largest air forces world (USAF US Navy). cost lot defend North America, offensive, power-projection weaponry costs much.

And wealth tax goes toward universal healthcare perhaps small UBI (not $1000 per month, something help people bit, couple $100 per person per month perhaps). Also USA's minimum wage sorely needs update.. dunno Biden's $15 / hour, definitely $10 / hour necessary. end practice corporations keep workers ""technically full time"" need provide healthcare... mean, get universal healthcare becomes way less concern. watch, immediately better workers 40 hours / week slackers lose jobs, universal healthcare instated.

Also eliminate Federal Reserve know it, stop financial engineering chirade. Central Banks monetary policy helpful, Fed clearly corrupt beyond belief ties biggest banks country way capital dispersed / stolen everyone's life savings every time print $1. 0% interest rates fucking normal, especially decade, wtf shit? distortions caused economy realized way, way late. would like say return gold standard, we'd need really massive reset could severe ramifications (revolution, supply chains permanently eliminated, famines, etc.), much I'd personally benefit gold re-valued $50,000 per ounce (where truly would debt properly accounted gold standard), money backed something ability simply print it. partial gold standard perhaps, like 25% redeemable gold, perhaps? dunno exactly would work, seems like money essentially worthless days, needs amount constant value OK, bit played still monetary policy. Remind me! 2 years read story town Georgia. Conspiracy theory sure he's late hearing it. touch whole situation articles like hurting helping. Miami resident, actions scare hell me...daily.

I'm comes smart ass usually practice civil disobedience case would include /s. Like Pneumonia death rates way higher be. 

Especially suspicious since would expect incidence e.g. flu common cold somewhat lower normal, since anti-COVID-19 precautions also anti-flu -cold precautions. experience. work restaurant strip mall people walk around parking lot time mask begrudgingly put one come get thier food. amount times politely ask people wear one pull nose astounding. 

I TIRED arguing people masks. tired asking people wear one and/or wear properly wearing mask myself. 9 hours day without complaining wear four minutes pick tacos, Karen. Karen man. Patriot app. fell Patriot act. think get past 500k? White House probably fiddling numbers lag studies show public messaging front line level.

That's true everything.

If people simple things: washed hands, avoided touching face, wore mask, kept distance...this would largely kept check. love description helps know less it’s going feel like! Thank much! That's always next best thing. control virus way. longer controls society. I’m not, didn’t specifically mention it’s concern areas time periods community transmission hell would I. got Florida tho. One word friends, reinfection. Soon word day reason don’t wanna get sick Discrimination? Arizona? way! You’re saying right everyone FL hunkered sheltering place? Obviously do. anything intelligent add? thought Cutter Incident occurred due fault manufacturing practices rather rushed approval process. in, safe working vaccine approved, required inactivating virus inactivation failed work batches.

Anywhere. DNRs. they've appropriate. I'm nurse. dealt PPE shortage, short staff, insufficient medications. I'm extraordinarily proud response medical community, support staff, administration managed get supplies had.

People given admin hospital crap. protests. people administration worked far longer hours medical. delivered, making deals internationally get us needed. talking viral load, initial exposure dose? Obviously higher viral load likely complications. That's amount virus within you. initial exposure dose though something different entirely seems rather unlikely would difference symptomatic asymptomatic initial dosage enough virus infect you. Hey man doing? S&amp;P completely erase losses earlier year. Looks like economy roaring friend. Hope sad/depressed best slow, controlled exposure one build antibodies?

Yup, that, practically segue vaccines, that's exactly vaccines do.

The CDC response early regrettable, given lot momentum anti mask wearing practices upfront start kind protection healthcare workers general population wear. hands passing air mask mask help rub eyes bite nails. (Well, guess probably help biting nails less ten minute later safely home paying nearly much attention browsing website another.)

Additionally, plenty diseases spread surface contact win prizes getting sick and/or dying something else outbreak taxing medical services.

Plus, people pointed out. generally good practice probably pushing years ago. justify Anything see whatever want see Even pass it’s still going take months mass produce distribute scale mean 4 years software engineering get Canada?

I've thought it, thing stopping salary compared US. know used think pretty selfish piece shit, Im actually pretty good guy. stayed away people, bought tons kn95 masks fiance offered many neighbors family. changed careers insured want contribute spread bar tending owner really give shit sort compliance prophets. I've lied, cheated stolen alot life I'm gonna hurt anyone stupidity good damn reason. I’ve tested twice. It’s really bad. Slight discomfort lasts seconds. Feels like jump water get water nose. eyes water that’s physiological response could bring tissue (they gave one times). might limited efficacy, still massive impact even 50% effective. new data that’s three leading candidates seems imply immune response good better convalescent. 

Some people strange desire seek worst possible outcome hold onto death grip. living black swan horrible thing right now. it. nightmare. Science going save us. Dig details perk up. retarded title    US pretty well testing now, #24 world tests per capita far. US definitely better finding cases than, say, India. overall? Look positivity rate (positive tests / total tests). get low rate raging epidemic testing. lots countries across Asia Europe much lower rates US. I'm person asked, think touching face. Thank you!! Common sense. Reddit needs r/maskskepticism want 96% pay cut lol I'm releasing inmates pose risk probably prison first place.

But question 8,000 inmates going go? going get jobs? going get money? There's recurring $2,000/month payments like Canada. one's going rent someone without job. 

This seems like ""We want pay house feed anymore, go live streets pandemic"" kind thing.  Soon Georgia next hotspot. Nope. Feel free link reputable source saying ""it would actually dangerous wear mask plane."" I'm waiting, guy tried linked people saying could helpful people needed masks more, wearing masks dangerous. Get fuck outta here.

The absolute closest find people talking idiots touch mask much reducing effectiveness, serious doctor telling people would *increase* risk, we'd better caretakers healthcare providers PPE normal people shortages.

If want fault government using resources force law ramp production pandemic shortage hit means lets that. fucking ridiculous knew coming. Lying said masks ""dangerous"" bullshit. Lmao couldn’t thousands protesters?

Edit: Lmao “show proof wasn’t thousands across country protesting” Viva la revolution think flagged misleading title makes strong claim regarding percentage actual audio / transcription makes loose claim without studies cited -- say information inaccurate even exaggerated, way ""misleading"" relation strength claim Can't believe waited mid-July Intel. wearing Lowe's Feb getting looks. Thank stupid ass partygoers people can’t live without going beach good reason believe strong certainty, virus act like Chicken Pox, Herpes, HIV, etc go dormant flare back up?

I keep reading long term cases people feeling well getting sicker ever testing positive followed negative positive questionable antibodies, etc. Honestly none make sense all. enough virus test positive replicating present large doses. matter got 1 particle 50 particles 5000 particles initial exposure.

Being exposed smaller number particles would make less likely become infected sure, infected enough test positive viral load reach whatever level reaches immune system fights it.

Viral load exposure linked severity usually health care workers, virus mutates rapidly, get exposed 5 different people, could give 5 slightly different strains sick enough hospital likely 5 strains stronger. John G. downvoted wife Bite pillow think England, old chap. And? hope manage avoid getting sick! try best. definitely difficult living people may cautious, I'm sorry. We'll make this, probably going pretty stressful while. least we're informed taking precautions! :)

I really hope end needing tents hospital parking lots here, heat would unbearable patients staff. Like said, sick heat would really awful. PPE healthcare workers wear, too. good! We've seen slight decline hospitalizations recently, I'm really hoping that's real trend continues. still big backlog unprocessed tests, though. 

Best luck you, stay safe! :) Weekend reporting. CIA Agent thank suggestion, even found one nevermind found good ones. Hardly anyone Finland uses masks either infection numbers low (currently) masks needed. CDC even said using pointless, they'll change tune if/when get hit second wave. Fair enough. However, way it’s worded makes seem like want Americans vaccinated don’t pose danger anyone else anymore, rather Americans human don’t deserve suffering nationalities. whatever, soon pandemic start traveling cares people vaccinated? what? typical american simpleton solution. Like revolution going change society, first day revolution would living country people day before. idea revolution would solve problems somehow change narcistic ignorant etc... society overnight childish.

I'm wondering larger infectious doses make respiratory system, tissue fragile, increased blood supply. even slight inflammation results tissue damage article littering. claiming masks medical waste specially disposed such, thrown away (normal) garbage.

Yeah. I'm sure they'll love getting fact got mum sick killed her. That's kind character building trauma really sets someone succeed life. That’s crazy. Nobody intentionally infecting people. think misinformation came masks help keep stock medical staff, kinda get that. fact initial falsehood caused divide population really rather concerning. 

I haven’t seen solid info come surface reasons people medically cant wear mask.

I think one big issues America used fighting force, fighting using finesse subtle responses like wearing mask distancing. Yo, came say exact thing. first four words mind-bending. Business travelers still thing. Many option. That's good info appreciate linking it. swayed good bit direction. 

Now talk anger issues? Precisely point. traumatize set back child many ways missing modified socialized environment marginal set backs yearly school curriculum discussed years needs revamped anyway. 

You’d think would’ve looked opportunity grow, expand rebuild education infrastructure United States. 

But nope. must go back we’ve always done regardless potential issues we’re dealing modern world. really necessary? middle pandemic want go camping across states? Idk. whole thing seems like people's priorities way off. Obviously children isolated individuals. Hence infect others. need keep infection raters lower are, helps close schools. OK infected, keep open.

My country Denmark closed lockdown. fewer people infected, reopened bunch meaaures minimize spread schools.

It mean N95 filters 0% smaller particles, fact probably 95% effective smaller larger particles. N95 masks like strainers small enough things pass holes, they're clever that. He’s westerner, expect? Mama Boucher right?  They’ll send Birx Fauci impersonation act like nothing happened

First, look Johns Hopkins Covidtrends testing numbers lower state positivity rate much higher.

Johns Hopkins CovidTrends get data place, covidtracking.com. data match state says also count extra multiple negatives person. reality, count once

Can explain further? data we're looking **total tests**, **total people tested**. amount virus (would) lose breathing essentially linear, rate virus reproduces exponential

In computer science quickly learn drop parts function matter much trying see long program run, that's useful analogy

Try opening graphing calculator (you find good ones google) plugging `5^x` 5 represents amount viral load got `^x` represents multiplication rate virus. 

We look linear loss viral particles breathing would help us subtracting linear amount particles per day `5^x - x` see might help little bit

But way bigger help would reduce initial viral load, compare `2^x`.

What *exactly* 1918, important literally every thing world different 1918 2020?

Well, get point, there's straightforward ""IT COVID"" checkbox. density NY remdesivir alone affect death rates. question asking percentage ends chronic conditions. still killer. really high death rate LA parts Florida health department come would see using manner compiles regulations? theoretical epidemiologist, job looking around postulating theories

You really know theoretical scientist does, you? Whatever works fellas That's unfortunate. type person double big deal. That's not. What? bad school flunk of? That's thing. think acknowledge social distance essential lockdown certain places, also acknowledge doesnt works right now. yes agree entirely those""autistic kids angels"" narrative. patient home, get absolutely tiring. Always wild read ramble again. need get made plaque something

*“Look, nuclear — uncle great professor scientist engineer, Dr. John Trump MIT; good genes, good genes, OK, smart, Wharton School Finance, good, smart — know, you’re conservative Republican, liberal, if, like, OK, ran liberal Democrat, would say I’m one smartest people anywhere world — it’s true! — you’re conservative Republican try — oh, number — that’s always start off: Went Wharton, good student, went there, went there, this, built fortune — know give like credentials time, we’re little disadvantaged — look nuclear deal, thing really bothers — would easy, it’s important lives — nuclear powerful; uncle explained many, many years ago, power 35 years ago; would explain power what’s going happen right, would thought? — look what’s going four prisoners — used three, it’s four — three even now, would said it’s messenger; fellas, fellas because, know, don’t, haven’t figured women smarter right men, so, know, it’s gonna take another 150 years — Persians great negotiators, Iranians great negotiators, so, they, killed, killed us, horrible.”* No. Next. Explain what's wrong. 

You clearly idea phase 3 UK already run data. releasing claiming conclusive. live Idaho, it’s really pathetic elected officials afraid mandate things like masks stores worried offending voter base public health. Oil freedom liquid form. God help someone pulls shit presence. Right. sobering statistics:

Taiwan's population (23.78 million) similar Florida's (21.48 million). Taiwan's area (36 193 km^2 ) much smaller Florida (170 304 km^2 ), meaning Taiwan far higher population density. yet, despite everything favoring Florida, still reports 23 times new cases (11 172 average daily cases past week) every day Taiwan since pandemic began (455 cases); meanwhile, number daily new deaths past week average Florida (114) 15 times total deaths Taiwan (7) since pandemic began. remember reading somewhere time infected infectious around 4-5 days.. okay..

Still, risks involved. Nothing ever 100% Serious questions- I'm pro mask. 

1) I'm walking around outside sidewalk city walk couple people every often stop talk anyone, wearing mask? (Not crowd standing near people stop lights)
2) I'm biking around city, wearing mask biking?

My thoughts no, I'm outside contact anyone. However I'm wondering I'm taking risk seriously enough wear regardless. Texas taking real measure stop spread? Seems like racing California Florida AZ 1st place
 Like sort crazy ass Nascar race.  I'm surprised. Right, nothing virus everything getting front cameras again. He's desperate. Read article. Learn something. Stop spewing uninformative garbage. Great guesses, based ""article"" includes 2 sentences. know. see multiple ways. way think unnecessary. was. take time walk around city without feeling sort anxiety. Healthcare need money. We're already spending money, per capita, every nation Earth. We're spending twice much ($10k USD vs 5k USD) countries universal health care. spending meant better outcomes, we'd living 120 now. not. need reform money.

Also East Asian allies directly threatened PRC incursions aggression. think happen abandon them. 

The PRC would able strong-arm toeing party line. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea might happen ""renegotiate"" trade agreements us.

Thanks, thanks. many documented outlier cases day 14.

 

My aunt one 22 days known exposure. pedantic math guy, said, pedantic mathy.

There 330,000,000 people America, 164,999,999 assholes majority could still good people.

But point, way selfish jerkfaces country us would liked consider day day still stands. pace what?

CA 2x **population** NY Donald trump ~~clinically~~ morbidly obese.

FTFY. ""dose""?
It's amount drug. 
If initial amount enough produce proper immune response, increased amount (so called ""double dose"") enough, treated failure? missing something video? interviewer said PM said ***might*** ready next year. “December/January” earliest. Dr. Gilbert didn’t even corroborate that. said hard know.

Literally *today* said release year still possible: [Yes, brain lot going around days. US rather small CoL compared many places Europe. visit Denmark see expensive shit is. charge per zone tram. point cannot say California worse NY. sure people need compare, do, trying guess measure using. unlikely LA going report 1000 deaths day point. !remindme 7 hours think herd immunity would work? smarty pants. like common cold get ever year. dumbest, lazest idea literally nothing make feel bad (it's fault right?) going work better literally rest world doing. think people Italy considering herd immunity? sure mean?

We huge unemployment benefits (which ending soon) gave people money worked average. $600/week plus state uemployment.

The ppp program made sure many people weren’t laid especially small companies. saved millions jobs. 

People get mandatory pod time getting covid (2 weeks believe), child care school closed covid (12 weeks believe) take care sick one covid.

Moratorium evictions mortgage payments time being.

So say government isn’t helping, mean haven’t yet extended help? 

To say government hasn’t extended massive help true. fact, America, bank deposits gone 2 trillion dollars people much money pandemic.

Posts like make angry makes sound like rest world American government shitting citizens. That’s true. room improvement, say that. Don’t lie upvotes covid getting weaker? get mask thing can’t least agree that. Many stores establishments it’s given now. 

But stay home orders, lol. Good luck that. sane person going sheltering place point. last name Kristensenii? CDC noted “limited number persons severe illness” may continue produce virus longer may warrant extending isolation period much 20 days. Ok, misunderstanding part.

Also, actually vacines work way (or probbaly pricise, still work given infection fast enough) Rabies Tetanus two examples know of, ""emergency vacinated"" vaccination status unknown, even slightest chance infection, even timewindow work pretty slow, 24h believe. Thank you. perfectly clear. person Walmart wearing mask. told be. said COPD ok wearing one. saw person shouting earlier. doctor know nothing COPD accept answer wished well. demeanor seemed stand offish little doubt actually COPD.

Either way thank input stay healthy. Phase 3 UK probably failed.

I believe current new trial Brazil uses 2 doses. Meaning would require new trials would take 4-6 months.

If phase 3 trials double dose regiment get approval double. unlikely events would happen physical stature. I'm sure know dont drop guard. Sometimes crazies act crazy hidden weapon. prepared stay safe. Jesus Christ. I’ve never seen less accurate collection words. research stop trolling whatever going here. tested negative beforehand, could virus possibly spread there? Yes, get infected, cells quickly generate neutralizing antibodies stop virus spreading. patient cell immunity probably going infecting someone else, although theoretically possible since know long whole process takes virus yet. Wow, money well able solve world hunger we're it.  lots people think shit real still.

entire neighborhoods blanketed warning signs people still walking around without masks licking hands touching doorknobs, etc.

LA doomed. &amp;#x200B;

CA - 400k infections.. 40 MILLION population

NY - 400k infections.. 20 MILLION population

&amp;#x200B;

CA needs ***ANOTHER*** 400k cases.. compare deaths. disagree that. Rouhani actually said 25 million ""may"" infected. estimate gave based health ministry report. official infected count much lower.  number. number resonate someone close joins number. still say news showing footage people sick scared, worked Vietnam. Showcase front lines pandemic, make real people see number. edgy stuff hope sister improves soon. What's Sweden's per capita death toll compared NYC.

Why different NYC's high?  Great point CFR modern medical care. 

On flip side, may valid questioning cost lockdowns. number people pushed poverty line, well consequences (child/spousal abuse, substance abuse, mental health, etc.) disturbing right. long think it'll 0 cases US? CDC longer receiving data, I'd say bout month. Maybe part Stable Genius’s next cognitive test. Where's outrage served $200 steak wearing SpongeBob Squarepants pajama ensemble? covid getting weaker though? many deaths now. America, fuck yeah! Um yeah ur traveling florida back ur NJ shore house dont want u actually is. See people get arrested spitting others pandemic.  Nothing, reddit people believe giving everyone's money away poor billionaires exist. ""Like Tsunami""

I recall several responses posts pandemic early months using exact phrase. disheartening see actually become fact. take 21 days. Even 14 days bit outlier - something like 95% people show symptoms day 10, with, said, average around 5 days. 

Everything else said right-on far I've read, verified cases symptoms appearing day 14, grand majority cases symptomatic present symptoms earlier that. specifically said schools open. I'm calling commentor claiming political move. much complex that. literally came best coronavirus news ever date people going seriously question expect us become worse hurts know better.

Yes! need humbled scare everyone weapons plague ppl stubborn frick things gonna go down.

Absolutely, I'm trying generalize every American. Obviously, I'm American thought one see I'd *really* fit stereotype American ego. mess Texas. Texas, corona mess you. seems kind stupid. Ive fit tested (qualitative quantitative) valved p100, use actively field work fine. significant difference 28-day patient died (0%) treatment group, died (12.8%) standard group**; P= 0.027 Among patients treatment arm patients admitted ICU (5.1%) arm, eleven patients (28.2%) ICU**. significant difference treatment standard Moreover, among patients **one patient received mechanical ventilation standard arm nine patients (23.1%) underwent mechanical ventilation**. No, needed deal radical leftist cities. Well level agree however American society complicit electing guy. health insurance work.
Most people know medi-cal sort state issued health. America sad joke. every one tested I’m you. clean masks use? Since can’t wash it, let rest 2-3 days using again, I’d interested alternatives. Also, I’ve reusing way months throw away somehow damaged. correct approach?

[This guide I’ve you. mean can't rule reason cannot release Phase 3 results UK. appear pretended exist cause major alarm.


The fact (appear) stalling start Phase 3 trials US also major red flag. I'm Canada, work cook special care home. resident drinking hand sanitizer weeks, seizures. he's hospital, management staff told anyone he's drinking hand sanitizer. 

And that's ONE THIRTY residents, issues pertaining drinking poisons, multiple problems. 

The managers told me. ""I know do"" ""I want get fired"" ""I used janitor got job"". 

The yelling mental abuse makes sick, I've literally scratched schedule can't fucking deal shit anymore. Multiple complaints made, lie way it. people complaining brain, otherwise can't describe issues. don't. They're mad, see filing complaint way getting revenge. Hence cycle. 

It's 100% owner. ""Food make happy. survive"" like fucking kidding useless cunt?  Offcourse India overtake Brazil , India 6times population Brazil. Yup... tired Florida getting attention... prove dumb really are! cannot true, according everyone Facebook November 4. 🙄 Texas updated statistics case severity? Early around 80% ""mild"", 20% needing hospitalization, vast increase cases would imagine would better numbers. Also looking updated statistics recovery times secondary effects (like damage lungs remaining recovery). Well old ones going heaven anyway. don't, deserve burn hell. /s



I still remember shock listening pastor preach glory god via story one followers made disrespectful non-believer blind. ok maim people rude believe thing you? Apparently yes, one performing said assault god-fearing Christian. Former Montanan here. state extremely red outside Missoula. Texas, no, got lucky finding urgent care available tests day. However, every place (CVS, Kroger, etc) booked least week out, fed run sites multi hour queues time needed tested. think anyone whose opinion matters ever made claim. employees' fault Florida backwards open unemployment working them. forced choose job possibly getting others sick. fault choosing work means live. GOP fault here. possible explanation pattern would something aggressively mediating spread point goes linear.

Is early partial herd immunity effect, social distancing effect, combination, none above?  feel like article said even enforced numbers complying still go up. bad rabbit hole. ended someone's Twitter awakening movement getting excited someone posted ""*** ready"" Flynn changed Twitter background. Like going apeshit means great purge.

Oh another person quoting Bible verse weak, except context chapter means something completely different. I'm Christian, way people abuse Bible offensive, use shield egos holy book grow from. Maxine waters net worth? used range 10 estimates found.

This unironically. Rick Scott destroying million lives $1000 worse Maxine Waters destroying 10 lives $1000 each. Again, understand orders magnitude? saw posted sometime last week mentioned work Home Depot heard seen anything this. Saturday, I'm still working still heard/seen anything this.

Maybe I'm overestimating people feel like least sizeable minority us would step fucking steamroll somebody this. know would. ignorance?

I'm telling people thinking.  you’d also assume reach something like 1 million new cases day there’d shutdowns etc would drag things out.

I think accept possibility we're already there. important remember tons people get never get tested. Indeed, stats suggest tons people get unaware it.

What's evidence ~1 million infections per day? started June Accurate af. Why? Primarily we're largely ignorant. state South Carolina, average high school graduate reads grade 6-7 level. They're taught mix religious bunk, distrust government authority acute dismissal science facts. generally 5-10, varies individual regions (2x rural South Dakota, 13x Chicago).

My assumption would regions likely reversed. easier 13x number infected reporting 200 cases, instance. would concerning area 100,000 infected actually 13x number cases. core capitalism encourages self interest values. 

This fine cases cynically assumes people act interests also sort locks people thinking way see larger impacts group see personally danger. Teenage wasteland, Teenage Wasteland...

Texas failed implement policies worked places like New York continued growth remains likely scenario. Texas nowhere near herd immunity. Yes, counting multiple negatives. 2 people get tested, one comes positive 3 times one gets counted. person tests negative 3 times 3 counted.

Thanks info! can't understand--what kind learning environment children really going forced 'go back?' every school district going practicing combination mask wearing, social distancing, limited interaction, constant sanitation, possible temporary closures, etc...then \*really\* effective properly setup online learning option? 

At time need adapt really adjust answers problems we're facing, feel conservative leaders want nothing simply shove square peg round hole claim 'this way.' spent time really creating effective inclusive learning environment established possible solutions issues we've heard (scheduling issues parents, connectivity / hardware inadequacies, lack technical knowledge, etc), confident value would reap would far exceed brilliant minds want call 'education.' me, like forced childcare prove point true nature pandemic. answer simple yes question? Seriously wasn’t hard can't see top thongs, I'm wearing them.  OK, who's actually enforcing this? know someone sick quarantined 7 days, seriously doubt asymptomatics going quarantine 14 days. pregnant Disney world (not choice ....

Never answer phone etc. it’s bullshit. accurate tests? knocking this, asking want get tested told they’re accurate everyday person wants fight kill everyday person. China north Korea want kill citizens don't. It’s 4th July wave infections strange attitude see. one hand people saying ""CAN BELIEVE CHINA WELDED PEOPLE INSIDE APARTMENTS"" exact people, hand, saying ""NO WAY CHINA GOT RID COVID-19!"" Like, I'm pretty sure strict lockdown measures, could easily crush virus. CCP honestly gave samples strains China us compare. 

No no, did.

Also, China mild flooding, mild famine, mild plague, mild swineflu, mild tornadoes mild freak summer snowstorms. 

Tune later Good News. Sounds like one trying cover 99% environmental activists use private planes, Di Caprio Al Gore prominent culprits. ""Do say, do"". grandparents part 'The Greatest Generation' amazing people thick major events defined generation; farmers nothing Great Depression, married young, grandpa went fight WW2...a generation defined incredibly tough work sacrifice.

The reason I'm glad died years ago ashamed would children's generation today. Entitlement, sense duty country sacrifice, compassion selfishness.  politicians literally obstacle.

If want shut need demand it. Part ""change CDC guidelines make going back school easier"" censored actually saying something contains minimum amount substance. fine. fine. /s prevented loosened protections. Syria's case, straight left threw wolves promising we'd protect them.

It doesnt work leave. Got reliable evidence that? Uhh never said Facebook remove groups. I'm sure got impression. absolutely remove false misleading information.  That's ""far left"" saying though? least progressive circles i'm in, idk neoliberals. I've seen anyone left say handled situation horribly, leading countless preventable deaths, supported workers all. know low mortality rate, many cases leads hospital overload; unchecked fully, leads MILLIONS american deaths short amount time. 

Of course get eventually (it's ""doomsday""), science shows mask wearing one effective ways prevent transmission outside social distancing, always possible, handwashing, believe mandated much possible hard hit areas. situation also shown fatal flaws economic political systems addressed, cruel for-profit private healthcare system. Please provide citation substantiates that, you’re wrong  Legally speaking punch someone face spitting face someone know? threat spitting knocking seems like viable self defense justification. Anyone know? day article linked first comment, announced 6-week old baby died Corpus Christi, Texas. deaths young people months US large increase Kawasaki disease children linked covid. infuriating leaders State ignoring facts force people harm's way.

And deaths lag cases \~21 days, people dying start recent spike. wiped coronavirus tomorrow, US already locked 1000+ deaths day well August. 

Arizona, Florida, Texas, South Carolina, California, Ohio, broke records number deaths day week, likely next week. depends really gym. Considering public gyms crowded problem lies

My university gym opened probably 5 10 people 4 story building. mask policies

The percentage people included massive. Soon world's economic thieves also stopping virus without vaccine

Plenty countries absolutely crushed virus. Greece population 10 million 197 deaths virtually eliminated within boarders. NZ also eliminated it. considering much health insurance is, pays for, much funeral is. I'd wager greater far.

However, disagree N95 masks could prevent spread like this. 

I honestly think (based personal observation reading articles) using face covering properly would greatly reduced amount cases. many people ignorant mask situation here. 

In beginning people assembly line better wearing masks, anti-mask stuff happened followed suit. started seeing cases place caused huge strain line send group people home get negative results. Recently people started better wearing masks, I'm hoping see decline cases on-site.

It seems counterproductive anti-maskers people protesting shut saying needed economy back. want simple thing ensure businesses remain open prosper. people put life jeopardy.

And, even think numbers bogus, 330 people died total. Globally 1 person per million would 7,800 total deaths 7.8 billion us infected. tenth percent 330k Americans dead everyone country infected 7,800,000 globally. That’s deaths, people who’ve sick, people who’ve hospitalized. would venture guess folks bit problem COVID-19.

Taken medicinal doses tolerance withdrawal. associated addiction withdrawal used frequently doses well exceeding prescribed amounts. taken solely night regulates brain's sleep rhythm ordered deep sleep, get 0% without it. 2 doses gets 5-8 hours somewhat normal sleep. That's for.  ones ever deal see/listen talk abolishing private property, away capitalism, ""workers owning means production"". landlord, exploiting tenants. Etc. Probably left field watched Joe Biden say going away ""shareholder capitalism"", ie, abolish/end stock market. 

Those ones people still need instructional videos tie shoelaces. landlord devil, kicked decided rent property he's also devil. People realise jobs capitalism. ambitions better future capitalism. retire capitalism. technological mod cons capitalism. people would also complete flat tax taxes going up.

They're reminiscent someone read 1st poli-sci textbook never actually point yo socialist country they'd like emulate. often Scandinavian countries mentioned, completely ignoring capitalist high rates tax. Commenting reason whatsoever! Sometimes wonder enough get even run restaurant especially rush Kings Queens! Every spring/summer people buy thevautside equipment like crazy. doctor super reluctant it

Do know why? driving crazy frustrating. can't mandate masks already Governor Mike ParStupid wanted go Jericho cruise February. Looking like that's really terrible idea even sets sail.

A long road ahead still. great though get encouraging news amidst bad news. okay, reread said, realized shouldnt come hard did. tired people acting like know everything immunity covid. they're experts. What's considered high? Currently, active case estimate Texas, example, around 0.75% population. One dream 😔 Firewall!  Sure do. go another grocery store. I’m sure comment addresses anything said. Better late never guess.

Shocked friends/Family arent making Trump masks, theyd sell many Protests lead massive spike

Hopefully least slightly undoes damage Trump anti mask every day virus now. think it’s *good* thing schools provide services enhance wellbeing children, especially complement stuff parents provide. unrealistic think two people fully fill every single need developing human needs first 18 years.

In reality, parents ever have, since used live larger extended family groups shared burden, modern parents also expected lot hands ever. honestly, think it’s good thing every parent needs learn hearing screens, disabled kid get speech therapy school building, kids benefit development classroom experienced teacher whatever.

how think ads work ? ads recommend you, were, nearby restaurants etc. /r/stopdrinking take wearing gloves anymore. tend sweat sweat like crazy them, take em absolutely disgusting sweat waterfall. think gloves biggest deal, mask glasses far important. I'm face toucher anyway.

But fucking funny mere months ago downvoted saying wear mask gloves. Massively too. glad case anymore.   comparison relative N95 though, sorry make clear.

I also read [study referring healthcare workers **and** patients wear masks. still using source control PPE.

There's also difference cloth masks, surgical masks, N95+ masks. Standards vary wildly PPE ranging 5% 65% obvious 95%.

Anyways, wear mask. Recreational purposes. sounds like withdrawling mid-dose. far know narcoleptics need dosing every four six hours reason.

The lower dose would probably allow use nightly without withdrawling mid-dose, makes sense.

Edit: Dopamine rebounds would higher well. get rush dopamine coming dose, need dose twice nightly stay asleep. happens non-narcoleptics too. would wake four hours almost dot ever fell asleep taking it. oh  safe say Gwangju cluster dead? 2 days row last like 2 weeks something officially declared ? really... going go rich first work way down. read article headline match content, reversed position Trump wore mask. Let's beat corona chads THANK YOU! Bookmarking comment dont spell numbers. Florida seen 10k+ confirmed cases day. Whats point?  either ~~the virus~~ cancer don’t. kind schizophrenic mental gymnastics fuckwits engaged in?

Disease isn’t binary. disease means possibility duplication (I.e. spread). die tiny fragment disease odds worse disease you. heard folks gyms public venues started closing meantime, though clear extent carried (they keeping mostly home well cannot say certain).

Do info chance? Yes. Japan also wear mask hay fever season, acne, get tan outdoors, want wear makeup day... people wear months time day seasonal allergies bad summer suntan. much big deal like debate wearing shirt pants public not. Seemed like valid comparison. person also said something ""valid"" anything covering face better nothing. ""ignorant"" saying so, look like asshole saying ignorant. 30,000 14,000? method still help US testing tatters. get even broad groups tested like quickly, still better 20 30 day lag individual tests.

The batch tests allow us drill specific areas test, giving us ability test directly. Throw Rona it’s possibly worse hell. called ""infectious dose"" (LOL). called viral load. wish articles put like did. calm realistic time. Ive seen people say infrared thermometer actually device conditions brain obey government lol stop this, alone. months ago sub might made sense anti-mask thing general opinion reddit. It’s low mortality rate low mortality rate. 

The amount people vents hospitals near amount people actually contracted virus. 

Hospitals probably treated what? hundred thousand best. number infected MILLIONS US. Likely higher 20million point time. Yet look take lower number 50% asymptomatic may never really know. 

As “if don’t take precautions...” didn’t take precautions. country problem hospitals. hospitals troubled temporary structures come hospital ships went back ports? haven’t redeployed one asking them... need follow story. dad ventilator posted video Facebook live explaining he’s alive people need take proper precautions. He’s still hospital though way cruise lines treat employees is, I’ve heard, reason enough want support industry. Lol saying people goddamn stupid wearing mask....You probably though wearing mask good idea three months ago? common sense, talk 2019? 1.5 million people died tuberculosis last year...  FTFY-Majority Americans mason Dixon line. anyone assume would be? Testing went 37% period positive cases went 194%. testing reason confirmed cases, virus really spreading.

Source: Chris Wallace’s recent interview Trump Hmmmmm like thousands thousands people? Reddit? volunteer substitute get sick, good luck finding one couple months remember potatoes Boise State. And... uh, that's really OP make comments symptom severity.... Checks aren’t sent everyone, taxfilers. got mere 35 dollars. Suddenly everyone mask expert. joke someone wanted shake hand say hello day moment panic someone pointed gun Limited resources limited lab testing capacity. I'm Canadian literally moment thought idaho type potato Boo Hey, times wore condom still caught chlamydia okay, case less severe.

That's type logic idiotic headline reads. Scientific authorities talking significance “viral load” (not infectious dose, infectious dose seperate factor) since pandemic began it’s seemingly impossible impart information majority public.

Infectious dose like thief gets house starts robbing it, increasing viral load like 10 thieves get house start robbing it, clearly thieves steal damage time house. Oh! Yes! exactly. You’re “engineer scientist” best source come Salon?  Look great fact article share conservative friends ignore Pretty soon saved comments gonna look like dude's body tattoos Memento. $600 get saying cant work virus. state UI different. load doesn’t correlate viral load.

Teacher, ""your child disrupting class."" 

Parent, ""how dare say perfect child."" Hospitals already capacity. talking about? Wake fantasy land. Like business zombie things adventure time there's ones spreading misleading information disguised data. while, people spreading rumor since N95 masks rated 95% 0.3 microns, can't filter 0.02 0.125 micron particles. Therefore, 0% efficient, therefore, cloth masks useless. personally expected lower %, 0%

I later found report 3M saying efficiency got tested anywhere 93%-98% particles around size, dependent manufacturer. reason Brownian Motion. particles bounce around like crazy, cases, N95 masks become efficient capturing particles provide shelter lot people society. consider value, fucking moron. fuck even knew asymptomatic cases thing  remember reading probably study. definitely gives lot merit wearing masks careful also hermit stuck house take wearer, unclear. 

Probably best washable clothes rotate.

This speculation take worth(nothing) guess mask still allows crap in, hopefully slower rate, may get stuck mask. kinda think sucking air threw hankerchief sneezed in... probably best get new mask every while. allowing travel plane coast coast still ?. Let’s keep spreading virus around never get rid it. BRB, going get in-laws. conservatives Nextdoor site posting “Why masks don’t work” articles studies done 2013. 3 months ago?

My comment (that quoted) genomic damage, damage genome potentially cause cancer later life.

Your response partial recovery lasting effects coronavirus, two different topics completely.

Coronavirus family members including nCoV2019 known cause acute damage affected organs - referring to. acute damage endothelial cells leads aggressive inflammatory response. damage taking long time recovery (and cases puts people donor lists)

My entire point, read full, damage referred to, acute physical damage affected organs - preciously concerning **not** possibility cancer damage genes - continually exposed things damage genes. viruses, sun, many things... concerning cancer point crazy.

Nobody even knew asymptomatic spread thing. 
Nobody knew airborne. 
Nobody knew fecal matter urine. 

So China act fast enuff repaid world locking 8 billion people February March slow spread. 

Americans got mostly Europe. See, that’s thing. burden present facts. not, you, exist. Giggitty! Geaux Tigers! Care elaborate? irony cloth masks still way less effective surgical masks, one even knows that.

Think competent leadership. mask story would gone.

As opposed morbid reality. go local corner store they're selling N95s counter dude cash register wearing paper thin cheetah print mask thinks looks cooler. gone beach? limiting access people distance strangers popular places. healthcare workers Covid19 deniers accuse falsifying exaggerating data nefarious means lololol! think anyone get sick die.

no, money - USA latest case/death charts San running 7-day case chart shows problem. people inherited property, monetize taking mortgage it. Everyone downvote anti-China nonsense. Reality cannot bias, reality is. ""always,"" 28% ""very often"" wear mask outside ""always"" people.



66% wear masks. may store want go makes them, social group shame them. ""Misery governor"" Saved Twitter far worse IME difficult buy masks from? That’s it’s saying all. headline masks limit viral load you’re infected small viral load symptoms less severe. infected person coughs face mask you’re getting massive viral load could result severe symptoms would sit let natural selection take course sake rest world, we're going vaccinate asses get back normal too.  nothing better system. juking stats make situation seem better is. could imagine treatment long term can't get vaccine works, healthy people volunteer given careful small dose virus gives high chance asymptomatic mild case virus. There's still real amount risk that, maybe merit behind it. There's also problem people potentially catching virus second time concerning though, especially second time might worse people asymptomatic  Right? People around world getting sick dying virus right now, virus enters mouth nose, cover damn mouth nose? sheer stupidity to. Could store relatively new, far edge territory. Store closed 2005 long gone then. mean governor California stuff Dem. Letting hair salons open outside kind moron that? gave specific example. city like San Francisco can't build additional housing.

No didn't? problem. cant open new hospital.. That's problem. Protecting workers safety regulations (that make sense) I'm taking about.

I agree problem. universal healthcare desirable councils governments authority. misunderstanding going on. I'm capitalism crony capitalism

I think many people actually capitalism. people claim capitalism bad actually want socialist policies, socialism. saying that's bad thing? things matter money. I'd argue time valuable money.. think? 

You're initial claim Americans give money country. That's saying wrong. matter people value different things, Americans give money countries. says number 2? Everything see 2019 they're top 2. 2020 yet can't data that

Sorry. top there. ‘Derp, masks still social conditioning.’

However, changes least one persons mind...that’s start. See added comment. say LARGE outbreaks. zero outbreaks. yeah, they’re deceptive. haven’t Reddit place America isn’t one big important cities called shithole. Wait ICU beds aren’t exponential? /s older women allegedly well, yet also almost every single Karen shown flipping wear mask stores. Got it. think rural areas live complete isolation nasty city folk invading them?

Food shipped somewhere, people travel healthcare reasons since anything beyond basic ER rare rural areas, people jobs populated areas, people friends family populated areas. Megachurches commuter parking lots big rural areas

All basic concepts considered saying dirty city dwellers responsible Yes preschool teacher (3-5 yr olds) mandated children area wear masks school times except sleeping eating. first heard would rule, scoffed. But- 3 weeks reopening kids fine. Even rambunctious kiddos still wear masks. even pretty good social distance washing hands. Kids better plenty adults know. Bathrooms Well, Truck then... dare drag majestic monstrosities down. wish got $275 week. That’s maximum state unemployment. Mine $125. hill ^^(literally) die on. can't even remember like March! whole situation makes want pull hair out. Obviously respect new rules, knowing ever able go another country anxiety inducing, love travel want it. soon over, want travel go back normal everyone, even us Americans. Yeah, that's *exactly* article recommends.

The fuck planet full idiots can't bothered educate literal existential crisis. Could regional thing. cashier time, turned 16 2001. area Winn Dixie poorer people went. money went Publix. money frugal went Albertsons. No, not. Keep wearing maybe get wash sometimes. IDK man, every year school, always handful kids gone Disney World.

Every.Single.Year.

All states going experience outbreaks soon schools open... Florida, Disney, kids would go Disney World.  Bruh literal Extended social isolation going cause lot students long term emotional developmental damage students, too, cavalierly dismissing effects academic setbacks irresponsible. 

If one choice harmful one choice not, answer would obvious, choices harmful. Taking high road calling bullshit given science denying idiots control country keep saying nothing drown reality lies offense, think die, hell Canada take in? does, able come back! Instead culling mink farms... understand common sense. People wear masks complete dummies every way. We're middle viral pandemic, basic hygiene point. makes sense! Goes show comprehensive understanding stage progression infection convalescence required properly treat patient needs supportive care.

Some say reduction infection fatality rate attributable virus becoming less deadly. Personally, think victory lies squarely feet medical professionals pouring everything combating virus. know today far ahead knew short months ago.   facebook friends care ""only"" 1% whatever population. later post mission trip they're going soon... least Canada get access free healthcare.

Pity Canadian Police still shoot indiscriminately Police America... Mostly things going pretty well far everyone taking virus seriously cases deaths trending protests caused virus take 3-week backseat everyone took streets completely undermined mostly concerted effort make sacrifices slow spread. 

Anyway, sound agitated. Go put mask take brisk walk. Oh...I'm hopeful vaccine found, optimistic data coming back vaccine media says.

It's still unknown point stop infection. That's really big component vaccine. Holy shit state US I'm sure they're sending tweets definitely-not-chinese-slave-wage-made cell phone. wild virus documented estimated diverged strain [50 years based known mutation rates RNA. Considering majority wild viruses documented, one close remarkable. 

It's akin getting DNA second cousin. may suspect one two genetic freaks, think many would jump conclusion genetically modified secret laboratory!

I really unsure consider specific [recombination common RNA viruses (i.e. including coronoviruses) indicate laboratory features [commonly seen coronoviruses.

Most telling lack [generic genomic sequence SARS-CoV-2. 

This interesting read origin: [Here’s scientists know coronavirus came bats wasn’t made Exactly. Hope doctors nurses post share what’s happening.  Make sure register vote still address say 1,000,000 times since February. Peak Prosperity explained back need let go correlation, causation. asymptomatic symptomatic exact viral loads, means level exposure. one thing mask would effect would level exposure. lab work shows asymptomatic people less viral sheddings. actually contagious symptomatic people.  Parents also refuse send kids back- homeschooling challenging accomplish Florida.

I know people work still solution lot people, but, laid anyways, unenroll kids sign homeschooler.

For younger grades especially, parent accomplish teaching hour public school system accomplishes whole day. That's criticism towards teachers- one-on-one works better class 20-30.

Edited add- yes, I'll homeschooling kid. husband laid frequently since March option work home.  Except ignorant assholes aldo infect people smarter 🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿  Disney closes they're forced to. [The CDC announced days ago cruises sail US ports Disney confirming complying. also tried open Disneyland get approval. Disney World open anything goes Florida. basically admitted country hates interview, im assuming ego hurt quite bit Swoosh  Inb4 NPR defunded Alright, that's good news, another endorsement methods we're already trying use, reasurring information people risk wear masks likely better mask even get virus. see grandfather good mask.

The curious question plays development immunity, real situation even is- all, large number asymptomatic people best spread infection (assuming asymptomatic status also means going suffer long-term effects, things I've heard people 'feel fine' still nasty problems going lungs hitting quite yet. another thing need better understand can.), good route toward Herd Immunity *if* people develop long-term immune defense works.

If previously asymptomatic people somehow loose immunity time, immunity general trouble developing staying around, hard say hell this. Floronavirus factually state experienced hardship due use masks, unlike anti-maskers. makes sick hear people phony excuses.

I hearing loss rely heavily lip reading. top that, social distancing, fight urge step bit closer someone understand saying. day ask person repeat five time, I'm still sure said walked away.

With said, nothing going stop wearing mask encouraging others wear mask can't stand thought getting someone else sick.  So... non american, sentiment odd considering school shootings happen much. Nobody dies school seems really insensitive? Jesus Christ. shopping clothes right now? 

“Oh yes, let try shirt maybe tried random stranger already.” 70% people trial developed either fever headache

I guess fair price pay, mean may sort thing given general population risk factor, right? Pchinan average person anti mask type person thinks America place globe rights. Eh, sounds like something Duterte would regular basis.

Better Trump, least. Yea theres huge shortage ammo hopefully first 2 work. Thanks answer, tried find data surveillance program cost per capita China seems behind US, suggests much higher spending GDP per capita. data?

I understand want answer, little personal, think defending China? Fairness? believe communism better system? ties Chinese community? asking curious person, sure I'm talking young american ideals, really liked study Gauss Legendre. 70% polio patients asymptomatic. remaining 30%, mild cases would recover 2 weeks. 0.5% patients severely weakened muscles associated polio, *of 0.5%*, 2\~5% children die, 15\~30% adults die.

COVID-19 pretty much comparable polio even believe high asymptomatic cases. COVID-19 damage neural system, course, however COVID-19 capable spreading air leaves set complications, perhaps permanent (e.g., lung damage). 

Just another disease compare to. hot, rich, American woman wants marry get in, I'm board. doubt would want marry though :( Nobody yet told cells dying.

I’m guessing regulatory cells- would help explain CRS dex helps late stage patients, also declining circulating cell counts. I'm standards required public gyms; masks gym's corridors, changing rooms, weight areas machine areas. say physical distancing enough since masks might hinder exerting themselves. thinking awful people generally sanitizing pre-pandemic so...should interesting. Imma keep working bunker decide safe. Lol Without even looking stats, would bet *anything* car sales down. Way even. Even smart folks like brains fall prey cherry-picking, confirmation bias, etc. could live area that's disproportionately affected economic downturn also. 

Or maybe true, car sales up. would surprised, that's consumer confidence works. 

On hand, someone going buy asset, vehicle pretty sturdy one. cars aside, would need lot convincing believe ""a vast majority people spending normally would."" okay.. fault people much processing power fucking rock.. got lucky... lol

Kidding aside, learned lot sub... still leaning... They're similar terms. much virus takes make person sick infectious dose. much virus sick person viral load. Ah, interesting!

I imagine number political problems need resolved first, too.

I imagine FDA-approved facilities US, right? previous administrations, think negotiations US allies would smooth. Given much effort current administration put cutting bridges allies, pandemic, though, might complicated time around.

We'll see, guess. already ordered 100 million doses vaccine

Most successful kickstarter ever people comment mask, explain might infected wear mask infect others. Maybe people keep distance shut mask. true, guarantee single elected Republican pushing one reasons. Oh, US, sorry! Wait get paid sick leave law? LET

Regardless person A's infectious load (maybe severe, maybe they're completely asymptomatic), wearing mask reduces many virus reach non-mask-wearing person B infect them. that's true. Though may realized, article satire pro wrestling publication. Great analogy. still recycle even neighbor doesn't. Wear mask. Truth, even try bring reason like get auto-banned. It’s gross sad. Oh, yeah, it’s probably impossible now, sure. Politically, anyway. Technically would still work good luck getting people listen. Translation:

""I give shit health children health people come contact with, I'm selfish care damaged children means damaged adults twenty years. I've got money think about, I'll dead time catches future workforce, problem. 

I got mine, care 'bout yours."" lol Also NHS example massive buying power thus huge leverage negotiations. 

They say they'll pay drug (cost + profit) like huge contract within wealthy nation. saying wear masks, tremendous masks, anyone. least Pfizer also seems good candidate well. Fairly anecdotal fat people happy fat. typically socially acceptable fat first place.

Body acceptance/HAES pretty small vocal minority. 

And no, agree it. That’s sets off. “Mask wearers vs. anti-mask wearers” it’s fucking social classification. 


It’s not. It’s “people care health others vs. selfish pricks” probably time supported bunker boy something. I’m Brit voted leave

fuck EU  read link everyone sharing think you’re correct. authors admit data incomplete draw conclusions. Further, article hasn’t peer reviewed. There’s reason push idea without evidence people get false sense security. 

We need continue social pressure wearing masks. people think masks protect others might ignore people public without masks. wouldn’t surprised reason latest spike due people wearing improper masks, made material doesn’t filter virus. Isn’t vaccines work??? Tbh I’m sure lol, accounting getting tested positive/negative disease. That’s good question tho, like think won’t since they’ll see cause death regardless Primarily cause virus can't move. hand peanut butter it, counter peanut butter one spot.

Now come along, someone cleans spot, virus loses shape due exposure, touch hands get enough get orifices infect you.

There logarithmic drop virus moves surface surface risk reduces.

People give people viruses. Talking Amazon driver 15 minutes risk box touched two places 2 minutes.

Doctors beginning know infection rate, spread quickly mask reduce risk people self control buy 2000 N95 masks making supply worse was.

Published 21 July 2020 03:31 guess I'm missing make difference much get beginning, matter bringing particles back numbers much greater initial dosage.  heat lamp rock. Good another excellent article yesterday asymmetry information US vs China, exactly that.

Do link? I'd interested reading it.  better remove brakes car, might fail. Yeah know I’ll alright hahahahahaha

Still yet hear solid assessment coming January
Just ‘good luck’ Hahaha God's America^^TM Ah, well, I'm doctor. likely tests know about! take cat vet today/yesterday. (Don't worry, alright, one cats scratched bit ear.) family trying take every safety precaution can, stay home much possible. cat really likes snuggling, pet, occasionally tries lick me. First off, possible get virus vet, possible transmit virus all? so, long ""self-isolate"" till pet, held, snuggled, lick freely? 15 years old diabetic. Idk ask question. 3 fiddy January/February? remember closing borders, that's symbolic anything else. Doesn’t every first year computer science student figure five different ways exact thing? It’s exactly rocket surgery. ;-) also heard it’s really small batches, can’t remember read that. It’s rational way others users grandmothers posted comment. stop posting 32 users top comments posted thing. Thanks. Imagine disease affected scientists

Whoever cured would win nobels According battery usage track phone, 0.28% battery drain caused Bluetooth 0.17% drain app itself. Essentially minimal  like read papers without Reply one President, supported long time continue so. truly understand masks work? goes right hands Deep State love Mr. President. Understand November. pointing mask narrative fake narrative like already know.

At point think they're impervious facts good advice even accidentally comes him. Maybe added page published?

Correct. No, silly. Like suspension bridge. Build bridge em. Drive articulated trucks em. Beat collapse. hammers. I'm saying enough take herd immunity realistic outcome, best hope vaccine simply provides recipients immunity, like tetanus shot, remaining anti-maskers get vaccine even want needs consequence bare minimum help society. one losing dude, can't even follow basic logic. vaccine based herd immunity possible critical mass anti-vaxxers, vaccine worth using one provides individual immunity, people refused wear masks receive it. would additional cost rest us, provided receive vaccine continue practice social distancing mask wearing, made things worse vaccine came benefit cooperation thousands scientists doctors work hard vaccine we'd practiced proper pandemic procedures jump. Macho Man Randy Savage sacrificed thwart Jesus 2012 apocalypse, he'd probably already made successful vaccine candidate scared coronavirus away. people fucking hopeless. Stay shit-hole country loves feed itself.

 

There's data fuckhead. comparison. Dumb fuck.

The reason second wave open border. includes important border pandemic, American one.

It's literally night day scenario. mask thing sounds almost good true COVID actually blood vessel disease (rather respiratory disease), transmitted like respiratory one. Vitamin important regulator endothelial (inner blood vessel) cells. might explain COVID pts low Vitamin level tend severe symptoms. According *geniuses* local news article comments sections, find new job different field. /s 

People dumb. 🙄 saw guy post something from... 2011!

I used updated study website shut up. transplant patient taking anti rejection drugs life.  means immune system. Covid kill her.  Come cousin mine nurse, got awful case virus exposed patients. ration ppe whole day guidelines said change every hours. got full pnuemonia still quite weak month diagnosis. Viral dose joke dad month ago, bragging proof hoax cause he's Florida, Georgia NC florida Georgia almost every weekend vacation. I've needlessly killed ducks before. want see live ones circle dead/dying one. fight ducks. insanity. couples supposed stay away other? one picks mild dose virus they're sure going infect person significantly larger dose. well cnn reporting trump tweeted pro mask statements soooo maybe they'll come around? Probably find way still blame us crazy liberals wacky experts though. Every place Minnesota requires masks. Target, Walmart, Gas stations, Grocery stores.

Took fucking long enough mandatory 3 months ago. Exactly.

On one hand makes intuitive sense less dose means body may time fight thus keep less sick even asymptomatic, massive dose overwhelms everything. 

But true? poor sap 100% 401 shorthaul Southern Ontario Sarnia Buffalo 

I poor sap. 

I want say everything spot on, guys home every day get hourly pay. 

Still sucks traffic SWO though. Fuck 401, GTA QEW! ‘But, like, stuff miss seeing friends’ basically response get everyone try tell don’t kill family. Although say less live something working.  Even getting vaccine, I’m sure hell going anywhere crowded good 6-12 months.. wait see well vaccine works others first. named app O'Rona Ok, we’re talking. Actually Minnesota Oregon saw increase cases directly protests began. Minnesota already hit pretty hard still saw increase afterward. Oregon like California mostly avoided large surge shortly protests.

Also many large metros states listed Dallas, Houston, Miami, Phoenix also large protests surges directly thereafter.

Why New York mostly avoided it? I’d say mostly everyone going get sick basically already did. 

Also, two things true once, heart message. Reopening isn’t helping, neither mobs people taking streets. 

The fact resistance sentiment reeks hypocrisy. sure seem to. respect that. good follow betters even see eye eye. I'll take mentor. sure car? Even further, cases artificially low Oklahoma due error actual numbers higher. Mmmm... well know they're using commercial lab that's also handling General publics testing, yes kind unethical pop group a's tests group b's, 

To date figured nba bought lab. sell kits make them, though! Truly fantastic achievement science. think, seemed hopeless end sight, though may far off. time next year we'll old lives back. Montana actually deeply red you’d think. elected Democrat Governor, running senate he’s got good shot.

We also shut everything majority country April, state-wide mask ordinance place.

Edit: said, it’s tourism pumping infections. got rid mandatory 14-day quarantine out-of-state travelers, screwing us right now. People flocking mountains summer “get away,” it’s locals paying price. taught use dictionary!? hell wrought? confused enough before! bliss bubble increase prices driven actual demand instead speculation. Prices go down, people need places live eventually buy back lower price. 2008, builders built many houses excess people needed live much speculation. Houses sitting empty years simply weren’t needed course :) love Guess buy everything amazon cause stores, cities/counties/states sure dwindling Lucky us, we're trying start way China. get one, economy fine!

/s Invisible China Virus? opposed China Viruses see naked eye? That’s kind thing viruses. They’re really, really small can’t see them.  Nah he's fucking leftist idiot Covid: IDAHO???? U DA HO!! There's simply enough room realistic solution. Or, difficult understand. Everyone wear mask public, ya know, safety well others. I’m one special inside knowledge, think wanted deter people panic-buying mass quantities N95s, initially told people wear masks. Luckily he's declined every shop. Statewide mandate businesses must require it. sounds like total bullshit unscientific. Hmm, much want hope,

plague inc says start evolving mutations infection vectors. They're also good environment. Floating cities tons waste. 'Misleading Title'? Peptide flavor cake? Lol. Idaho even borders you. Although Canadian side mostly woods think. parents genuinely believe Microchip shit real wont take vaccine Bill Gates'

I've lost fair amount faith today.  “my body, right.”

Ironically, they're probably anti-abortion anti-marijuana. wish. 

Drivers like even entitled OT pay. Thats thing though. 20 years old qualified pick apples. Certaintly big brain provided opportunities, would taken them.

By definition, youre joke. one cares think. example, work grocery stores then? can’t pay literally everyone stay home. talking general specifically Tennessee. 

And record also saying happening Tennessee people working pods hospitals health departments saying opening new cases people 3 4 times retest try get back work. 

I'm one people thinks hoax. family taking seriously family works healthcare. sharing observation seen area. 

Downvote hearts content. sharing experience. need know long lasts. lifetime immunity, rid thing part end 2021. shorter immunity, hopefully get nasal misters booster ""shots"" make appealing people. yes, making cheap, easy, pain-free important. ""9mm kills body, 45 kills soul.""

this comment brought jamteen-11 gang^TM seems like likely resurgence infection, I've read. I've read, stance social distancing effective people go much masks give false sense security. BC also low case count they've done far working now.

Theoretically, given choice 30 percent movement masks 80 percent movement masks social distancing, former would preferred exposure contact tracing standpoint.

There's also enforcement issue, argues policing challenging due resources so, make arbitrary cutoff medically exempt. making things outright illegal, fear events driven underground making contact tracing much harder.

Personally, think inevitable mandate masks indeterminate line sand, get done normalize behaviour

I think Richmond highest masked population lowest case count lower mainland fluke Well, isnt really guarantee safe return school within months. could even year sincerely safe. 

We might well start setting teleschool infrastructure now. Even Covid-19 quickly vaccinated, it'll still useful next possible pandemic. Entitled pet owners often batshit insane. 

They need hire professional security enforce masks. would cool embroider mask recent info find, masks required Hobby Lobby. didn’t think either. I’m point people don’t want wear masks good luck them, don’t feel sorry people actually taken stance anti masks. Get sick die guess. us taking actual precaution ones left sounds like pretty society lmao. seriously I’ve wearing masks since cdc told us to. OMG wonder anyone switched us like maga dude purposely wearing masks spite Fauci (and people begging refuses - you’re mr maga lmk) saying technically type bubble 2007, 23 million renters evicted going affect millions mortgage owners speculated growing jobs markets 2-3-4 loans properties specifically bought rentals evictions create housing crash?   

I hope right. know google it...but words, what’s difference confederation federation? thought like identical Whose favorite mask re-used mask getting autoclave treatment car mirror? Nothing says hygiene like re-using mask daily. brain drain happened 90s early 00s policy bringing people might brain drain also upskilling exercise NZ small country opportunities niche highly skilled industries larger country would have. teachers teach remotely kids classroom want go school. Every college student ever smoked pot dorm, done exactly that. Numbers though? Big Island Hawaii also close 100% compliance, attribute least part living isolated island. long history foreign invaders wreaked havoc. think president recently tweeted pro mask tweet perhaps still hope. bet throws mean curveball. Call “the mask.” Welp, guess grocery shop much winter! ok, deserve what's coming them. Lol 3 coworkers nurses went Florida past two weeks sponsorship? Sure it’s viral load created replicating inside you. inhaling it.

[Virus experts know viral dose affects illness severity. lab, mice receiving low dose virus clear recover, virus higher dose kills them. **Dose sensitivity observed every common acute viral infection studied lab animals, including normally quiet neighborhood seen increase small thefts, people seem utterly perplexed happening.  can't understand anti-maskers. claim useless/pointless/no disease all. Like, logic, better: take mask hox get nothing, real die, spread someone die/spread further. stupid think mean hand egg mentioned elsewhere, irrelevant point. History remember surgeon general United States gave wrong guidance beginning pandemic, resulting thousands upon thousands deaths. amount finger pointing ""he too"" ""both sides same"" absolves guilt. one charge nation's health, matter anybody else said, responsibility alone. want shoulder responsibility, taken job influential powerful physician nation. passed job someone else.

Going Fox news 5 months later pleading people put mask little, late. makes look like fool. kids literally don’t fully developed ability think complex plans consequences. That’s adults decide. don’t make good choices hypothetical risks underdeveloped prefrontal cortex. I'm much peasant science engineer. Come dude. incapable telling truth? Nobody believes sort education. question. Could skewed people tend younger wear mask would asymptomatic begin with? evenly distributed among age groups? mean cushion  Solid point. never closed fair one trying go March April  Professional sports clearly mind-numbing agent society. sooner bring back sooner people stop paying attention. anti-mask people gonna now? defeated coronavirus everybody let's go Disney World!

Thought would get comment way anybody else could. first thing pictured bukkake. look what's specifically happening Catalonia. notice. Lung damage feel like anything. get xray lungs probably would look worse chainsmokers. something feel pain receptors lung. Also low oxygen feels like nothing. Even opposite. Low oxygen higher CO2 blood levels give slight high. put someone room fill CO2 start become stupid time fall dead. 
Loads people Cancer feel thing. mean Cancer ain't dangerous. knowing got thing scary thing virus. know need seek medical attention quickly. first case Berlin jung man fell room roommates call ambulance would died without anyone knowing. idea many people died like this. 
Also no. sub. Germany lot people starting talk long-term effects. Swedens way handling virus called Desaster. reason never got bad people isolation social distancing own.
Look need die get severely damaged. Think it. think would happen news talking horrible virus really is? study shows kills testosteron production men came March immediately blocked China citizens could see it. never got real reporting Germany bet speak US even though done one renown centers fertility. I'm saying hiding I'm saying point everyone seemed far worried death. already looking might us long-term. One fields I'm interested sexuality ask migh impact it. story delightful random thoroughly enjoyed it! mean problem putting stuff NYC lot people hospitals...for brief moment...it ended gone backwards despite everyone NYC basically going back outside socially distancing wearing masks. Go walk Central Park one day. People place. Close wearing masks. Yet overflowing hospitals. someone recently watched Community, conversation «Gandhi» «Chang» interesting. Don’t hire worker. open window, place unit, close gaps. *hire patented ""WOOOOOOOO!"" mask on? World Laughs. Wait- HOTELs requiring masks common areas this? Trump virus now. [Like thankful scientists. They're ones end nightmare. Salaries way higher US, appreciating educated people lot. salary 100k + standard pretty good US.
Don't forget pay 44-48% taxes. basically first 6 months work society start earning. Pina colada time! Watching run coconut oil Amazon. live MA. seen anyone public without mask since May. single maskless person sighted two months. wait freaking long? now, already.

*looks calendar dismay*

Are kidding me?! Better news would already wealthy shareholders Gilead Pharmceuticals making over$3,000 profits drug taxpayers paid developed nd costs $10 per dose make. got downvoted.

But every conspiracy 2020 coming true. heard reports initially sbout this. find Fungus patients lungs im starting really fucking wonder dude.

When initially infected HIV. portion people get flu/pneumonia die. theres attempta im aure moniter recovered patients CD4 levels.

This screwy Hahaha. Oh serious. 

Come it’s like vaccines something buy Walmart/Costco shelf.

Price gouging illegal price vaccines much supply vs demand. insurance provider cover cost. don’t it’ll likely free 20-30$. even made families survive weekly food, without spreadingthe virus much, mean LEADER PEOPLE., say well chinese gov lied that. well say gov live state state gov told record three months ago. say well this. well also. also say country done people. pandemic. guess next education knowledge comprehend words wrote. pick choose. 

what want hear read. shows logic know. LET GUESS MAINSTREAM MEDIA CELL PHONE SHAPE MIND MAKE BECOME ZOMBIE. get believe everything say, even get hate another country witout even truly knowing another country hear another country based said MEDIA CONTROLLED BY. understand said there. come back insulting like little child. say something clearly know. told.  Hawaii we’ve low rates, part due excellent contact tracing, compliance masking social distancing, today’s news lieutenant governor (who doctor) excited new batch testing. Yet less 15% Swiss population active users app. history bullheaded wanting told 'from above' do. Surprisingly, 95% population go along mandatory masks rule public transport, guess easier see immediate benefit there... personally, I'm worried data privacy, almost always leave phone home go anywhere (just want available 24/7). anyone said date Phase 3 research set conclude? much review needed long distributed? 

I seen info detail ""hopefully October"" ... you? hadn’t thought - super important info! I've posted times, Trump mentioned Communists want Americans sick pushing anti-mask narrative. I’m apparently confused issue. need research understand better. awful time, get this. give up. Whoever are, ever are, got total stranger cheering on.  lovely, eh? Thanks, id never heard term. Im it. Oh there’s plenty blame go around. part goes Fauci lying American people. Good scientists don’t that. Hurrrr durrr nothing ""no shit"" this. researched.

So arguing ""no shit"". many people, news another evidence/reason wear masks. Less severe? Sure, knew helps \_\_\_insert reason\_\_\_. Wear mask! That's it.

Everyone's pro-mask team yet insist minute things argue nothing. Downvoting every post arguing nothing. pointless. possibility mutation, could make worse. He's also using cash, wooo.  Wear mask. Trump stroke toilet streaming game twiTtEring. Yup. grandchildren rolling eyes weird hygiene paranoia. won’t even thankful sharing precious masks! 

(“Here go, Johnny. it’s _good_ kind like doctors use. 95%.” 

“Uh huh. Okay, Grandma.” {tosses it} {insert rage} 

“Just take grandmother’s mask.” 

“Fine!” 

“Nobody understands! kids take granted get sniffles aaalll meds everything available. Well, inmy day... don’t think won’t happen again!” {rantrant}).

We’ll squirting hand sanitizer every chance giving randos wiiiide berth.

We’re going give children germ phobias. live Seattle area: Florida already insane shortage teachers.

You can't possibly fill positions.

Hopefully teachers union still save dues strike. Florida revoke teaching certificates, negotiate back. Berlin ""really"" germany tho tbh hope taboo gone future year's episode.  that's context March 8th Surgeon General's? tweet February... know live Idaho mask usage pretty universal Boise grocery stores. fishnet mask works now? compliance safety. actually safety would actual guidance masks needed. 

Any moron wearing bandana, touching face, smelling produce grocery store remasking exact wearing one all. 

It's safety fact said masks effective begin proves point. Mercola anti-vax claims Vitamin effective flu shot Vitamin C prevents measles? surprise he's spreading lies masks well finding new ways profit stupid ignorant. This. act like ""optional"" company says ""ok great back normal."" 

They need say companies *need* offer WFH possible. way many outbreaks people indoors time MASKS US schools closed parents kept kids home mere mention rumored school shooting American parents teachers guilt-tripped shamed wanting schools fully reopen. 25 per 1 million unfortunately, 100k.

So they're 250 =/ mostly limiting distance person's breathing sneezing travel *not* filtering air people breathe?

Edit: words: keeping people's breath themselves?  fucking virus administration done us expose many fucking insane pieces shit live country.

I words this. absolutely nothing brain damage way down. Exactly this. it’s 100% effective it’s zero percent effective mentality. It’s many people coming together right thing science work out. don’t think need explain why. think hard thing see isn’t much political US people make be. It’s selfishness entitlement here. Yes political it’s fuck someone going tell do. bookmarking comment fear constituents starve.

They’ve drumming boycott business enacts mask policy fit week two pretty much limited piggly wiggly bodegas. still don’t understand argument. Even try think like crazy person. masks condition people hats, pants, shirts, socks? Like perspective? Plus part point infect others rater end severe symptoms end overwhelming hospitals. Damn fucked mine Yeah locations 100% mask wearing 0% freedom so...

/s  1. Lol, probably me.

2. Smh. friend 3D print ""filter covers"" (with new Biohazard/Resident Evil themed set way!) disc filters real big brain solution disposable headphone covers lmfao. care, still gonna wear Umbrella Corp covers lol. Ofc need learn german.
We need study language country live in. owe people country 2021..?

i would hope. enjoy conspiracies whilst wearing mask. Checkmate John Balliver  totally agree you. point two months live even legally visit parents. roommate never around, legally direct social interaction weekly visit grocery store. 

The effectiveness argued, effect negatively, I'm sure people struggling even me, really sucks. great. Pets incredible! Everybody needs Beauford life. that's fucking gross. workers go strike without approval union. Ding! Ding! Ding! merit based system smart. Hating people Shit Hole countries not.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* there's still lot country percent positive low, batch testing free supplies go places percent positive high people need wear masks lake though? I'm Illinois high mask compliance especially cities everyone wears mask outside. watch usa- they're coming record, they've got *favelas*... What’s then? Meanwhile mayor city Texas live recording ridiculous videos COVID-19 prevention would maybe useful three months ago, reading little kids via zoom, something, county judge tweeting great pecan industry region... cases keep going receded since began. Mostly everything open, parks full mask-less, ""who-gives-a-shit"" teens, heard neighbors party yesterday. Things could worst, could homeless broke, somehow make feel better fact living sinkhole pure unadulterated ignorance apathy. Ugh.

edit: fixed grammatical error someone else actually read showed cherry picking. dae masks? mention cloth mask generally breathing material, instead gaps around mask. inhaling means suspended droplets aerosols pulled they're near enough face, cough sneeze ejecting sides.

Even we're stage mask policies put place, people still realize facts. I'm going sit small meeting room people hour even we're wearing masks. masks either becoming saturated risk themselves, we're spreading around enough droplets/aerosols sides mask we're creating hazardous area.

Distancing times, avoiding enclosed spaces people outside household still best thing reduce spread. said it. Thats Ebola wear m95 mask hang around virus samples like 5 minutes so. little ebola never hurt anyone, limit exposure! 😎 Like COVID-19 goal prevent spreading overwhelming nation stupidity better limit vector spread much possible isolate already infected treated later. Blah blah.. heard? 

There 00.00 chance moron going listen let die!

Sure, they'll take them.. you? go outside. wear mask keep social distancing. could world let morons kill themselves.

never meant ""Fuck you,"" world. kind want fist fight you. fucking up. US typically get paid participate medical studies. Except work Western European countries would wrong test English Germanic language.

With Latin alphabet via French c. 1000-1300?ad mean, certainly don‘t ignore Given amount people refuse wear masks, see reason expose subjects. Ethically determined expose anyway, keep track it? body, choice hear time, let's measure see happens.  There's also website archives tweets easily searchable:

http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive Bye bye. know get medication help antisocial tendencies. make smarter though. Good luck champ! like ""my state pretty damn stupid, too"" (which Missouri) never said that, yet said, locked fully care economy, even gave free food lock down. say like cannot see bigger picture, full hate. Numbers going lower Sunday Monday anyway. real numbers start getting Tuesday. every center testing Sundays institutions like jails homeless shelters forth might able get testings done least later Monday numbers get CDCs cutoff time. America sends people, sending best. sending people lots problems, bringing problems them.  know wonderful informed, sometime like “oh fuck, know shit.damn...” spread obesity advocating it. right people affects harming - ignores fact fat acceptance movement directly harms people attempting help. get wrong, governments wasteful stupid every day.

However, **most** people need police force follow law. follow law.

In case, governments police ""fucktards"". people refusing wear masks. Place blame belongs. make lot assumptions people know never met. included. speak words give examples. Please, Tell I'm wrong. Please give specifics.

By way, scientist. job analyze data.  always medcram youtube channel, quoted study showed people spent 30 minutes close proximity (I think metre) confirmed covid19 patient showed 18% chance contracting agree 100% sell mask Confederate flag. long gets idiots wear one. starts nowhere quarantine stopped forms public transpo leaving many stranded work places unable go home private vehicles. office people literally spend months office choice choice. Medical workers unable go work transpo provided issues medical workers even charged fines checkpoints even though occupations allowed go work. efforts mass testing, contact tracing ever happened PPE's, masks government purchase rather donations locals countries, even though president got special powers allowing take control private business covid purchases tap national budget covid use, never used except purchasing masks PPE's, came later on, much purchased, also program give people money, poorest poor supposedly less half supposed budget used rest magically disappeared. cases like positive case senator wife went hospital wife give birth senator never revealed hospital positive case people put danger despite fact said senator one idiots pushing strict quarantine laws, one law say obviously bull. hardly tests conducted medical workers well early mid period strict quarantine. also hardly testing done police manning checkpoints probably infected yet lot people go them. became apparent particular higher police force birthday party lot people later tried hard BS way made positive case police apparent...lots really. tip iceberg. crying unfair want testing treatment: tried better sports? Idk thought *you promoted management* “Sir Wendy’s. Please wear mask.”  'Assisting Kim money' misleading.
It bribe N.Koreans pave way Inter Korean Summit, improved relations bit.
Also, friendly China reliance trade. working lessen reliance China working closely Russia, Indonesia, India. ~3 million people die every year US, guess we're 5% increase deaths year. happened see interview local news channel. psychologist said likely help try punish non-compliers, would likely fruitful try entice people comply want to, to.  Awesome! Shut bars. also inexplicable urge tell someone steam ROXORS!!!1111 Yaa time population high also social life quite different .People isolated , self centred called globalization. compare ice age prehistoric age today's situation .. today's world survival need many things needed 200 yrs back .. start today?

Fucking 6 months shit idiots still parroting totally debunked ""just flu"" narritive. literally joke. mini market (Tesco Express) morning person wearing mask. Including staff. healthy mean get corona. 22, healthy, fit nearly died virus. altough I've recovered 4 months ago, lungs still damaged probably always murder hornets taken human form  Tokyo picked testing bit. others testing enough find significant amount cases. Gloves spread disease asshole, wife works hospital, don’t allow anybody gloves even enter building. sad. bet wore masks still somehow got sick. Yeah camp counselor high school charge 12-13 year olds, which, borrow phrase John Mulaney, like hiring horse take care dog. terrible history knowledge. Maybe world 100 years old, right, two parents working thing human history unless wealthy. Housewives luxury modern world higher classes past could've afforded. annual Karen jamboree? system works, limits spread kerbside pickup.

Only issue is, gets feel like got moral highground thinks beaten system skimming past days, negative news talking about? posts saying great everything is? 

What said Sweden poor strategy already said newsworthy unless new developments occur. unless deep analysis articles, spam too. like posts defending Sverigebilden. Everyone considers new cases (even small municipality) good. many consider news. Maybe point missing. sucks. started cool-looking shit, future would lot better us:

 

Not mention, slap LEDs we'd living Bladerunner. log off, chronically online eroded empathy  Depose tyrant. Yes point I'd try convince distant Canadian cousins marry escape route Wish Anders Tegnell would listen Multi-layer cloth masks highly effective per studies. layers bandana reach effectiveness. using online mask patterns make cloth masks hospital workers, friends family decent sewing machine. spent time testing origami folded masks see effectiveness. even t-shirts folded face works well trapping moisture cutting smells. cuts smell, cuts Covid sized particles per researchers Nothing. shame. pretend always pro mask Q.e.d.

Look every Sunday Monday see always lower trend.  That's works. recent situation US taught anything? Stop generalizing based people's beliefs affiliations, judging entire group people based actions ideals few. True, aware analogy limited every time bring viral load people medical community get confused trying simplify analogy. People least know virus replicates itself, seemed irrelevant point making. concept struggle viral load groups virus trying replicate. 

Maybe better analogy would taking high interest loan, borrow/contract chance going bankrupt interest payments becoming unmanageable. certainly kill you! strolled edge? like care child dies held responsible way though. disgusting. Obviously it’s people without vast intelligence, m’lord. happening America. Duterte dictator-for-life bullshit, mean draconian approach zero tolerance Covid stupidity. 

When sinking ship, nobody allowed drill holes lifeboats foolishly fail understand floating works. 1 million really lot... even close confirmation. Vague language giving false hope. whole day? That's long more.

Still waiting company announce revoke anti-science policy tweet. Thank goodness. Every time go Aldi someone walking around store coughing, without face mask on. Though would nice employees wore masks properly. One lady shopping curbside order day mask around neck, breathing groceries. Trying flee pandemic. safer here. Nothing see here. go away. military personnel prop hospitals totally normal. /s  Angels don’t exist.

Mike Trout would like word Anecdotal. part study per se. zero data took got better... low quality post... must say rather bungled Brexit felt quite drop pride country news made go up, proud UK universities.  Evidence remdesivir seems sparse, switched human interest pieces promote it.

Telling. true, many well following guidelines. reality there's 4 Governor's maybe dozen Republican representatives federal level asshats. hurdle creating vaccine looks over.

Where gather from? article clearly states could still problems long term effects. study run long enough understand long may last, study Lancet showed. makes skeptical virus replicates exponentially matter much particles start with, stop replicating obvious. ""Homeless Americans vote, easy""

Things going well metrics decided play doctor. personal dislike individual invalidate efficacy backed measurable data. stopped effective President stopped supporting him. Lol thought Belgian like me, Charles Michel (our previous prime minister) picture government. trending right direction. guess effect 4th July weekend. actually LA 4th things pretty good (70% mask compliance outdoors plenty space people), idiots probably went SD beaches open spread brought back there. 

Then again, 2 weeks since Newsom closed bars indoor dining 1 week since things (like hair salons) closed lot worst counties. hopefully spikes coming days aberrational holiday weekend see decline after. analogy flawed thieves also multiply one thief becomes 10 thieves time. low number initial thieves buys time respond respond - notice thief becomes 10 thieves - house wrecked eventually. one calls police person wearing mask. call police lack mask causes tension, quickly escalate something police *should* called about.

It's like seeing someone casually walking street winter wearing ski mask. Probably call police, right? ski-masked person crawling someone's fence open window, probably call police, *just safe.*

I get police called make people put masks on, called non-masked person becomes belligerent refused entry service. let's face it, kind person walks up, without mask, store requiring masks right someone *looking* fight.

Sorry, police. That's job. 10,000 people take part next stage trials UK.
However, trial also expanded countries levels coronavirus low UK, making hard know vaccine effective.
There large trial involving 30,000 people US well 2,000 South Africa 5,000 Brazil.

This actually says. Conveniently leaving expansion testing. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Yes exactly that.

I guess different definition win win....


But description accurate, actually confirms suspected.

Thank educating me. use response support initially wrote ITT KCDC different stance this. published Emerg Inf Dis. Yea. notice extroverted tends people say can't take anymore. introverted I'd like stop deaths. Staying seem high price pay. 

But realize must uncomfortable made speak public ""hang out”. lives stake forced things live. time. absolutely counted bug cases. rambling random tweets nearly 4 years now, even thought respect finally getting brain cell activated highly doubt tweet somehow brings chance thousands tweets did. used link original video (in Hebrew) see now. links video English translation well transcription narration. find original video come back post here. everyone like this. daughter barely since March. gone store twice - mask. you. went walks around neighborhood drives get house. Thankfully laws pool spending time there. Probably ever comes swimming. WTF? look graph. classic case buy rumor sell news. huge runup last week rumor get access to. Monday classic dead cat. basically news priced last week anyone buying now. usually little guy, got left holding bags usual. there's money made know looking for. gets tiring explaing difference risk prevention risk mitigation, latter really means, mask latter. 

Mitigation critical tool. ""all nothing"" approach moronic. right. hundreds people looking apps. I'll trust say safe.

We'll see fast vulnerabilities fixed they're discovered though. biggest fear government releasing app maintaining it, often happens government websites country. much less effective *do not* fact enough people trace 10k cases time. think called gaiters, can’t recommend place buy though. used link original video (in Hebrew) see now. links video English translation well transcription narration. find original video come back post here. US government hundreds thousands data management tools disposal, varying utility efficacy. systems generally good contracts awarded companies support/deliver/develop them. Oh, bureaucrats sit top them.

What likely dumb executive HHS liked certain dashboard showed instead CDC's White House meeting, able manipulate data view show angle got President one idiot staffers' attention, sudden we're using one instead old one. order ensure White House see dashboard (which public CDC's site), moved taken down... enter news cycle.

I worked Recovery Act large agency back 2009 thing happened us. great data management tool worked us, White House OMB wanted better aggregate view, combined data agencies', next thing know managing one data set vacuum handing bureaucratic master would throw bunch data tell 'different story'. big difference method collection never changed, grantees never affected. hospitals told change protocols delivery data methods capture... mean Jesus Christ dashboards matter point.

Not saying fair right, government I'm pretty used to, one many, many reasons left private sector... discover thing happens different reasons. I’m 28 year old teacher Georgia. working writing week. I’m terrified Funny. comment go read bunch studies including stuff NASA studying astronauts space. Even extreme conditions don’t support statement. 

Wearing mask hour go shopping won’t destroy immune system.  ask millions medical professionals wear masks hours time immune systems destroyed. 

No. Stop spreading false information. Facebook pandemic itself. suspect part PR campaign honest.

For worth, I'm Swede think strategy based [complete ([here's angrier post similar think paints much nicer picture country know everyone board it. I'm confused test options around. I'm Boston area hardly anyone offers rapid response nasal swab, pcr nasal swab taking least 7 days come back, there's blood test (antibody?) supposedly tests current well past infection comes back day supposedly. last one seems especially suspicious.
Also what's insurance it'll take least 7 days get results back 2?? I'd written Latin able understand it, went simple version. Also ""she"", Dr. misleading, 95% asymptomatic rate infected. Oh wow, didn’t even know option. watched someone get one done Instagram didn’t look enjoyable. yourself, guess can’t bad! late bodies warm piling already. Fucking idiot politician's. dont doctors put stuff YouTube tell people bad things are, see news lying? Trump lies every god damn day isn’t held responsible? matter reprehensible lie is. 

Fauci Surgeon General may “lied” public, sure, that’s one way look it, won’t deny it. 

Or, look strategy standpoint. knew people would try get masks PPE shortage. strategic statement order save medical workers, major players fighting disease someone it. People weren’t sick didn’t need mask tweet published, really spread country. still recommended anyone felt sick wear mask. 

So time, think fair tweet. little time information virus evolved, changed flat lie, large portion country believe you

I’ve wished true since 2015 think confusing viral load initial infectious dose. Viral load amount virus detected time test, usually swab. easily measured. Initial exposure dose amount virus person got exposed resulted infection. unknown number. lot people get two terms confused.

More virus = higher likelihood infection. case studies, exposure time used proxy amount virus inhaled, expires time correlate directly greater risk infection. 

The relationship dose disease severity less clear. ethical study Covid dangerous, done initial exposure dose studies influenza, mild correlation high doses symptoms. varies quite bit, researchers think infectious dose play role matter much immune response. aware studies examines effect additional exposures, probably make things better. 

I remember one study looks family size, relationship linear. Families three members higher rate transmission families four members. straightforward. believe spouses much likely infect non-spouse (27% vs 10%) children may less affected, see Table 3 biggest determinant whether household transmission happen whether family isolated sick individual upon appearance symptoms. likely read comment suggesting could made millions selling patriotic masks early tries squeeze cash &amp; visibility campaign. Facebook deserve recognition, refused fact check anything first place Husband works district. NJEA came said reopening. Guess they're working something. Everytime hear microchip conspiracy - picture vaccine coming cereal box. Instead two scoops raisins, microchips. could (and eg. lot European states have) state controlled quarantine, stay hotel government officials nearby control quarantine. expensive, would option anyone wanting enter country means pay it. soon man. You’re right, it’s sad. Ehhhh open source works well long enough people looking it. even Linux kernel bad bad-ish vulns every month.

I'm big fan open source, think long term much better security. still pretty new code cautious claims secure. Canadian here. reading articles various states edge flooded hospitals 3 weeks now.

Are actually flooded yet? Wow, remdesivir^^^TM sure works totally understands, one them. could seen outcome beforehand huh? /s Thank you. real supervillain shit. Even Thanos said fuck kids still gave 50% chance doubt figures unless deaths greatly under-reported.  assumption people low income spend little they've got wasteful stuff? spreading disinformation? idea -- coronavirus party, masks know place ask. full face coverings called? get them? ones wrap way around head neck, look like second shirt bring past nose. Erm ok.  Yes son likely fine he's going give I'm high risk Soft pay wall comparing Sweden Finland.

Tldr: Sweden 7700 cases per million, 560 deaths per million.

Finland 1300 cases per million, 60 deaths per million. restaurant.  younger staff curbside, owner onsite every minute we're open incase. Folks tripping! live right across street school. I'm even exaggerating literally right front mailbox - steps across street - traffic amount parents/kids outside 3 PM insane. gonna shit show keeps inside triple. 

Also I'm friends lot teachers co-workers died COVID-19 now, making concerning reopening pushing forward :-( 'Murca exceptionalism rugged individualism ""win"" y'all! mad friend feeling annoyed entire lives turned upside months? think friend one issues. Chad going save us end! interesting test. one hand, followers cult like. other, American selfishness ignorance unrivaled.

Willing bet anti-maskers keep anti-masking. Well 1 million euro prize guess least 900k Euros ha  sure need permission European country, interest? live LA. Since mid March, I've seen friends person twice; April couple sheltering home recently friend kept distance spoke 15 minutes. wear mask whenever go except I'm driving. basically bathe sanitizer whenever touch anything.

I hate damn fools taking seriously I'm gonna keep I'm doing. can't take risk.

What sucks I'm going tell friends wedding weeks wedding party parents beach, that's still 20 people altogether 19 many. couple canceling yet may still call off.

Yes, used properly (and advertised accurately) N99 (a bit) better N95. one neoprene masks holds N99 filters. trust it’s actually filtering 99% (vs 95%) Bad Stuff? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Any sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable magic. can’t see what’s filtered I’m basically trusting “N99 spell” stronger “N95 spell” — assuming I’m getting spell exactly right (good fit, trustworthy vendor/manufacturer, self-contaminating, etc. etc.). used China Italy bad. It’s US huge many states horrible job right much nonsense going on. mention, majority Reddit’s user-base American.   
I American post lot US familiar news sources here. always post interesting article country well. 
Another helpful thing use sub’s flair filter. thing, completely avoided specific examples claimed possible.

You stating want true way example. It’s Progressive Internet Fan Fiction, even remotely come close clearing bar qualifies example.

Or succinctly, going need sassy attitude back talk here. No, really shouldn't. one thing, governors really kind authority individuals begin cases would really something state legislatures probably address.  
  
Governors kings, they're state government managers.  
 
For another, *anything* guy gets portrayed negatively matter better let states handle it, they're supposed anyway. dropped /s people going send kids schools full unqualified teachers qualified ones smart enough know it’s safe?
Who would send child unqualified teacher? That’s insane. China USA fair, unlikely get any, even there's widespread long term immunity, people wonky immune systems.

Even chicken pox, known immunity, rare double infection. Add ton people getting infected odds little higher see reinfections.

That seeing shit ton healthcare workers getting reinfected pretty telling tho, imo. expecting stance agree saying. Messaging matters. study peer review atm. 200 participants 79% severe outcomes reduced hospital recovery time SNG001 patients. 3 patients died placebo none SNG001. Egg &amp; Spoon races considered even less safe basketball, fortunately NAEASRA done right thing suspended year’s fixtures. family lives DC area. outside since March. think go November.

I feel like Cassandra. dawned March going happen. one believes - withdraw world while.

I withdrew kids school shut down. couple parents tried arrange play date mid march!?!? know many people believed that.  Yes, sound uber paranoid. would worry it. Many ways possible transmission concerned with.  oh see, separation church state convenient church, got it. Shelley. English BA degree paying dividends today. Oh, we're Georgia, though. State Department Health told schools area viral loads/cases consideration! We’re Minnesota think nine month old nephew covid. dad got tested today. I’m scared them. So, basically low key purge TWICE densely populated feel like risk long term effects vaccine far lower long term effects getting covid. getting soon possibly can. sure sure that. NYC, through, estimated 25% population infected 

Quite bit shy 70% needed reach herd immunity. 

Don't forget, 70% population needed infected *survive*--the dead ones count. 

Anyways see, we? Tbh really Federal government make decisions. That's States decide. reason states Governors state legislators. Poverty, definition, state extremely poor. Someone can’t afford pay bills kicked housing, either evicted apartment rent forced house foreclosed, current state poverty. poor can’t afford keep roof head. case, impoverished. Homeless poverty need discussed together because, 99% time, homelessness caused poverty.

After reading additional comments, considering fact referred landlords “housed landlords” earlier, it’s pretty clear you’re trying say struggles landlords less significant came place privilege (being able property begin with) whereas tenants not, relatively speaking.

So, basically, think landlords “better off” happened don’t deserve kind consideration tenants had/have worse, according you. Got it. Check. Well sure congress president overwhelmingly vote working solution right away. big boy leagues going crushed terrible leaders end ruining football season. wish, current administration there’s chance happening. Even smaller scale, Atlanta mayor wanted mandate masks city governor banned I'm anti-vax, like all, fully vaccinated, even male HPV vaccine doctor said would protect partners. Buuuut I'm rushing take vaccine 30 year old shape, major health issues person.. Nah. let people risk guinea pigs rushed vaccine. I'll give 2022 likely earliest. figure saving vaccine someone either risk, fearful this, am. definitely want COVID, mask up, sanitizer car, washing hands far frequently normally would (like touching public surface basically door handles work, open shirt usually too)... But, rushed vaccine? Nah. wait version 2.0 2022 / see goes. GOP paid commision coronavirus, could spread virus effectively combined corruption, negligence, mismanagement, misinformation sheer stupidity. still issue over-qualified engineers competing entry levels jobs. Hiring managers going pick 6-figures employees 99% certain leave soon get new offer.

Friend works Amazon logistics they're surprisingly high attrition rate half latest hires left restaurants opened back up. 4 million cases rounds 15, one day it'll disappear like magic. Easier said done. Anyone else remember 2 million dead summer lie? Strongly disagree, countries international students important function universities. ways minimize spread returning campus. quarantine 14 days test let attend. They’re trying get whole state killed. Lol socialist fuck live one exemptions wearing masks go vote. logic behind politics. Yeah, idk. think it’s equal. thick padding helmets. You’re still close contact, you’re sweaty fuck outfits I’d imagine, meaning fluid transmit. don’t think COVID passes sweat, I’m still rooting safe side still don’t know 100% is. 

Basketball practically naked. mean really. don’t need protection anything, yet ton touching. 

Thing is, close contact, I’d imagine sports might hold out. much cash grab NFL is, going Trump sized hissy fit can’t anything year. ""self""-promotes thank much Hey good vent sometimes. feel saying. I'm sorry so's family inconsiderate honestly dumb. hope get sick. :( willing sacrifice teachers ... uh ... something ... really pretty undefined, it?

Yes, I'm sure interrupting schooling entire generation Americans year absolutely adverse consequences. Thanks. long talk. We've working things. I'm antidepressants took day spend birthday today.

It's progress. facts all, mad can’t fix numbers liking Grab covidfefe. tend agree this. I'm sure would happen people get tested right away, might lose opportunity completely. tough situation sound. alternative that's worldwide focused? someone please link. one's good enough want info US terrible everything else. need vote buddy, retort, simple hope future.

Edit: anyone hears ""achievements man"" thinks achievements male humans wrong. Well seeing 4 got pet shop, yeah would kinda cruel release now. That's tactic used long time US. Ignorant article- aerosol community outlines CLEARLY public react news (if correct) article fails address points. Main points- open windows! Ventilate! 6 ft enough- at-least 10 ft distance! Always mask indoors outside home group. simple things everyone adopt might save lives. Articles like *not* helping. what? randomly send checks? Masks required Illinois too...but bet ass still plenty people don’t wear company home trial diagnosed covid see treatments stops even go hospital.  “Americans fucking dumb, congress actually amend constitution give states power require masks times global pandemic” Yeah, worked well last time gave corporations bunch money layoff workers. Inhuman assholes laid employees anyways assume Americans? Life, uh uh uh uh uh, finds way. must robbed before... shocking president mad, orange buffoon?! Maybe true smart people move Ohio. husband kind regretting moving back. Especially living rural Ohio. Sounds like might extrovert type thrives social interaction. me, awesome, people like I'm sure hard. 

We need extroverts there! Go thing hide behind scenes fix things make things :D dice slice ... Staying closed would extremely stupid. Masks/distancing good. Closing entirely would lead even worse situation. Thanks Saint Louis Oh wow like care take 🤔 Ah, MS, then. 

Personally, county county mask mandate kinda pointless. virus going stop crossed county line; it'll keep going. Similar state lines. really wearing masks, even made mandatory federal level, know would plenty dumb people would flout mandate claim government stepping rights.

Sigh. Oh, 'pretending test lying results' method... happen notice article posted nothing coronavirus? election rigged sort way, concrete evidence rigging, would happy take part revolution corrupt government power government supposed derived people. people say respect constitution. ha. I’m telling NASA uses official terminology documents procedures opposed what’s argument. 

It’s fact. Sorry don’t like it. Hypocrite.. remember saying China hiding numbers .. look tables turned. Lmao, they’ll fine. know several people managed save $10k plus Agreed. took party's mission serious. Reduce role government. want? Gonna assume vaccine creators programming experience. programmers always looking one-shot method fixing problem permanently matter mutations stupidity users occur. 

I quite hopeful this. though? Everything see seems indicate need thing country. job justify hiring internationally sponsor Yeah everyone's faults maybe one side aisle near monopoly fking moron? does. could cost people retirement, license, etc. matters lot

For reference: I’m teacher  imagine first round likely go medical professionals / frontline workers rich. Didn’t mention JFK moon landing? we’re associating conspiracy theories around political ideology politics took wrong turn somewhere. yea... ain't gonna work. per Canadian labour laws every right refuse work deemed unsafe.

&amp;#x200B;

Its pretty fucking unsafe USA.  advise looking comments. brain hurt reading southern states waited longer March lockdown they'd still phase 1 lockdown from, let's say May? Surprised US students getting back in. US site volunteering vaccine trials:   Thats little condescending, university students understand threat covid-19 asked something education doubt would hesitate comply. mild symptoms asymptomatic two different things. agree larger expected number people contracted virus (and either mild symptoms asymptomatic) great. higher infection rate, lower death hospitalization rate. However, rates clearly still far higher seen flu lifetime. Florida labs busted ""cooking books"" tampering data reporting negative COVID-19 test results March July 2020.   Mostly False**   True**  least 45 COVID-19 testing laboratories Florida failed report negative test results March July 2020, thus inaccurate positive testing rates recorded facilities. However, 300 Florida labs report negative results time frame.   Undetermined**  health officials said laboratories required report positive negative test results, testing facilities Snopes spoke said among discrepancies reporting requirements, Florida Department Health previously require negative test results reported. Snopes find evidence omission negative results data minority Florida labs' reporting intentional nefarious. still relevant would likely put pressure healthcare system affect already infected coronavirus anyone wondering legit, press release NIH link. (Correct I'm wrong!) idk stupid get governor changing results election something people would revolt over. I'm physician working covid unit since march. keep assessment myself. say, though, know couple moderate, mild-mannered people believe probably accidentally escaped lab. accept suppressed prevent calls WWIII. going give 80 year olds. [it seems financial motivation...  election won’t pushed back. solution simple; mail-in ballot

So election pushed back 


And Trump cite public safety reason He's obviously saying masks work 

 **They effective preventing general public catching** Buddy mine got tested, got positive result quarantine period post-symptoms 10 days. Pretty useless you’ve cleared virus based symptoms get positive result back. far picked lot fringe news sites, yet know anyone serious endorses this.

There already good vetted studies showed virus natural . Done back parts country saying nothing value everything coming mouth going result nothing death destruction.  freedom consequences. fucking tired shit. views opinions equally valid remotely deserving platform. Already happening, hospitals COVID beds full, couple weeks. sick people come ER get stuck hallway, beds. get stressed leave, die home. mention regular ICU full well GI bleeds, overdoses DKA’s aren’t getting taken care either.  COVID deaths, kind too. left morning unit full 3 ICU beds holding ER. 4 COVID holding ER, rooms inn. live middle Boston mask wearing definitely widespread. think least 90% outdoors around Boston Common (largest park middle city). I've even seen runners wearing masks, impressive. think teachers problem education system aren’t informed enough problem comment it. Stop getting worldview Facebook I've already looked it. Unfortunately company dosent branch Canada. shame, Minnesotan feel I'm already part Canadian exactly. APA initially recommended keep open, said 'it depends' Florida blew up. Bu..bu.. borders lines drawn sand! RACISM!! That's like golden ticket. Go, go. There’s cases Denver Bartonella quintana going on. Aka trench fever. 3 cases far I’ve seen. Lmao way I’m ever gonna get another vaccine life, especially one hurriedly developed among “pandemic” questionable origins non-serious death rate. Come wake sheeple think wrote john lewis tweet either... Okay. if- legit 25% tests actually *completely fake?* That's insane let's go it.


THE NUMBERS STILL HORRIBLE

Why even excuse‽ That’s literally first 3 phases trial are. They’ve done testing, they’re currently verifying promising results.

This vaccine wasn’t whipped couple months. Oxford team working vaccine delivery platform time, shifted focus COVID using work already foundation. know they’re doing, they’re flinging shit see sticks. Yeah sorry meant, weekly episodes. didn’t start watching pandemic original comment didn’t want say he’d posting “episodes” didn’t know episodes 20-30 minutes TV show, they’re usually longer record shorter ones pandemic complications ""Trump Flu""? really offensive hurtful me. absolutely love job I’m freaking awesome teacher. supposed quit? supposed student loans? mortgage? What’s advice that? could possibly seen happening🕵️

Opening schools totally fine though 😳 Imagine medical professional saying left save lives siding DeSantis. Hypocrisy part hippocratic oath iirc.  Walking Trump? really answer question. much obvious, death still really unlikely virus; family member 1% chance death, statistically make sense many household succumb. Probably genetics play. Yup, different immigration process itself, got status, either PR citizenship, good move anywhere. mean Florida beaches, bars, theme parks full tourists?  People talk tests, hospital ICUs hit capacity, like almost 50 Florida hospitals, that's need know cases exploding. Tests tests.  get that, I'm arguing masks vs masks. I'm saying focus wrong place. put 10% much energy telling people cut way sugar get exercise outdoors, we'd beating virus back MUCH hammering away masks. effects healthy body dwarf anything mask could prevent virus, cut severity. still don’t understand “everyone touch ball” sports safe. 

~~Basketball~~ Baseball seems unsafe tho least it’s outside full contact man man defense sport. 

Golf “solo performance comparison” sports seem safest (eg competitive swimming, track field fact (you literally alone outside well distanced using balls equipment don’t share). Tennis seems in-between; one hand small groups outside, hand shared ball.

Hockey seems potentially unsafe cold + indoors + large teams + heavy breathing, people play hockey seem less...selfish? bubble system could work. Maybe it’s canada thing trust hockey players baseball basketball players maintain bubble (NBA people already caught sneaking disney “bubble” get sum fuk dicks egos important anyone’s health safety guess...) Good said time time again, done lot sooner. 

Better late never guess... Exhibit A: r/MaskSkepticism shows online account one set up. I’m sure understood said. mean test positive virus, they’ll able go back without negative test long they’re free symptoms. Parents ones making determination. 

I get it’s hard kids tested. do. It’s another reason district particular isn’t ready open person. That's way life already several Asian countries.

That’s big problem... exactly make constitutionality argument?

I'm talking practical enforcement. Let's say Dems grab filibuster proof majority Senate, control House White house, put nationwide mask mandate.

What gonna red jurisdictions across nation flip em bird? 

They dropping federal agents every 7/11 kingdom come kick people's teeth in? Obviously not, manpower that. Everybody knows children bastion cleanliness obedience. Complete speculation:

It could possible partially innoculate super low dose, still would advisable. People likely respond differently case case basis. risk people developing life threatening conditions hope inoculation. Limiting spread proper vaccine available still seems like better course action. every chance ask reasonable questions. instead chose refuse sign.

**Earlier today, Swedish Public Health Agency presented new report future forecasts coronavirus Sweden.**

**In worst case scenario, 7,000 Swedes would die coming year.**

**Now Swedish Public Health Agency backing down.**

**""We accidentally rounded everywhere"", authority tells Aftonbladet.**

Several media reported morning another 7,000 people could die corona Sweden autumn 2021. case [Public Health worst future scenario would become reality.

However, figures report, picked news agency TT quoted several media, incorrect.

When Aftonbladet asks question figures various scenarios interpreted, Public Health Agency's head analysis Lisa Brouwers first answers something gone wrong summary number expected deaths per week. returns email Aftonbladet.

""There something wrong files. accidentally rounded upwards everywhere, made wrong small numbers, 1, regions, ""writes Brouwers.

When new information published, turns margin error large. scenario zero, assumes current level spread infection continue, additional 204 people estimated die corona - instead 2,500 first forecast said.

In scenario one, assumes sharp peak autumn followed decrease peak New Year, 3,213 people expected die instead of, previously stated, 5,000 people.

## ""Nothing wrong""

And worst-case scenario, prolonged steadily increasing spread, 5,437 corona deaths expected, instead previous 7,200.

When Public Health Agency's head analysis, Brouwers, asked could wrong, says decimal numbers rounded nearest whole number.

\- fault rounding fault.

**But turned completely wrong result?**

\- sum lot small numbers 0.01 integers, so. Output presented without rounding, gives correct result summing.

**How could wrong beginning?**

\- statistician wrote rounded up, danger all, says head analysis Brouwers. ADE always possibility medications carry side effects.

Some medications, example, carry disproportionate risk measures last resort. black labels require liability waiver.

But people require extraordinary measures.

Your care team determines treatment plan based risks rewards. use medical intervention casually. article calls covaxin vaccine. missing? That's assuming everyone gets once. People would take 4 times year, etc. creates issue manufacturing it.

We need see thing plays out. Hopefully immunity lasts longer highly effective. getting downvoted this. Look graph Oregon cases. impressively low riots. control. Almost like 20,000 people shoulder shoulder yelling every night 6 hours bad pandemic. Dominican rep curfews place weekdays 7pm - 6am weekend 5pm-6am jail night still really working. Considering accuracy deliver ads, could whole lot stop organized misinformation really wanted to. enough make case trying something, without anything all.

I'm starting wonder % Facebook engagement actually wacky conspiracy shares groups, racist shares groups? enough choose rid platform it. Mexico? better yet, Cuba? apology? understand mechanism behind him? Within week seen pro-mask entire time followers. Watch. case, dont deliberately infect people tiny viral load see bodies response? think demographics probably contributing too. latest wave infections seems kicked younger people flocking together soon restrictions started lifting. people least likely end dying Covid even get hospitalized. suspect delayed uptick deaths seeing younger people inevitably spreading families, co-workers, etc unchecked community spread bets off. be, timing good true  entrenched irrational stances pro social health guidelines, would convince expensive question, easy simply dismiss, hard actually change minds. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* people refuse leave denied service wearing masks?

Edit: I'm looking you, obstinate Costco floor-grandma acronyms please. flu also attacks heart, causes heart problems. It’s news article academic report Since US care anyone else, let alone Canada? 

I think US people upset border closure reasons toddlers get mad things. can't, regardless good reasons may be. 

Canadians want US healthy policies politicians stupid. elected them. scoff you? richest country world can’t provide citizens months (if that). Fucking pathetic. Everyone UBI plus unemployment benefits everyone can’t work remotely. freeze rent bills, fucking Medicare all. Everyone able sit home fucking year need be, vaccines start getting pumped out. 

I’m tired hearing excuses can’t people whining “where get money?!?”. fucking money. slashing defense budget little? 

Just quick google much spend military compared next highest-spending countries:

United States America 732.0 billion 

People's Republic China 261.0 billion

India 71.1 billion

Russian Federation 65.1 billion

That’s money spend military, I’m even getting money spend bailouts companies don’t even need it. Point is, fucking money take care everyone don’t. Instead we’re forcing poor people risk health families health go back work rich keep getting richer. if.
Are american? holy buddy...

You know happens then? called, ""Make me."" driver gets local/in country job. MOL suck dick...just like Calfrac, like Schlumberger, like employer tries force 'me' something clearly unsafe.

About 50% truckers meet overweight, get little exercise, general arent good health compared others. exposed covid-19 suffer greatly due increased body mass, possible smoking related complications. Now...considering transmission rates CURRENTLY exploding USA coupled poorer health average doesnt take much fuckin' brain power figure safe many guys.

However, end...what decide happens far work work for. one forces work. one forcing Canadians work. 'We decide' here....not USA. even MOL. lives mean us ministry. slaves bought purchased.

Request Denied. reason joined Reddit. done news bring one sided, well research message public. read scientific part news actually bit positive. It’s good know already treatments seem help people get hospitalized. It’s good know vaccins seems work. It’s good know mortality rate seems less bad stated beginning.

The news really anxiety inducing. think overly worried surface transmission. that's opinion. extra time spend inside grocery store environment spraying things probably greater risk surface transmission. however, entitled whatever makes feel safe, course great advice, thanks I’m surprised hasn’t deleted community mentioned 3,3% first comment... purpose. continue believe incompetency foolish. know fix won't. considered malice toward citizens United States. white versus colored! people versus government use cover money grabbing agenda human cost. nothing, livestock eyes. 

Wake America! government done wage war rest world. We're next already happening quietly around you. feel athletes. Hope staying strong. right move. took time read post history still don’t understand I’m coming from, you’re utter fool. reason stopped intubating quite often easy killed people. Particularly elderly, actual intubation seem trigger cascade ended death. You, arrogant shithead, arguing distribution care increases suffering, increases pain, doesn’t save lives. would fact increase mortality decreasing likelihood survival overall. miserable nasty thing do. don’t know you’re talking about, do, please shut fuck up. I’ve given direction start reading. Pull head ass stupid piece shit.

You persist thinking don’t want intubate elderly hate something. I’m one put goddamn bag watch fester rot bed family “does right thing“ keeping husk used person ""breathing"". Two possibilities exist. Either insufferably arrogant ignorant time sadist. third option. one actually understands disagreement. That's interesting perspective never considered. thought terrible English. Hasn’t California mandatory mask policy month now? Sorry man! young. wonder implies anything regard long term exposure, re-catching it, etc. 

RIP Dr dude sounds reasonable world burning. 🤯 Also spreading Covid-19.  strange state constitution overrides federal constitution gives us freedom assembly protests.

I guess constitutionalists all. Better deal problems early rather let fester. prompted look it. Looks like STD rumor bit overstated accurate looking country STD rates. Unless evidence haven’t CNN talk Florida California?  public floggings anyone complying. keep you’ve doing. wouldn’t hurt extra cautious. trying focus fact virus actually transmitted via air droplets micro-droppets/aerosols people. masks distancing important.   character definitely relevant, idiot. say it’s straw man argument proceed repeatedly put forth conjecture. JFC Oh, another insane Republican. Got it. children unhealthy prior getting virus went state booming cases...

I just.. understand logic. Stay home people. PLEASE. disagree. People need traveling, especially hot spots, spreading thing around. Clearly people can't right thing own. dunno, growing parents slept separate rooms. didn’t get along well. Mostly civil, close. 

That isn’t case wife I, I’ve assumed one gets it, get it. intentionally, course. plan one us develops symptoms. asymptomatic phase filled cuddles, so...? hate stores step plate government people leading charge, someone lives ignorant Georgia, thankful this!!  Genuine question, see people taking getting headache fever, safe immuno-compromised people ? 

My dad kidney transplant years ago permanent medication steroids concoction immunosuppresants.

will able get vaccine like this? rely herd immunity? 

Thanks answering questions  One simply ""stroll edge"" flat earth. surrounded wall ice mountains. else would water stay in?

(Never mind ice floats). like California Florida west coast.  winning much he's tired winning  ""The New York Post’s source said Flair’s wife quite ill, probably asymptomatic showed symptoms bouts coughing""

Don't hate asymptomatic symptoms? Sunday Monday usually lower reporting days. Keep mind, test results see come day before. takes places decent bit time actually reporting.

But, weekends, likely less clerical workers working.

Lets see numbers today. That's real test.

But, messed seems, states may want test less get less cases. Unless I’m reading wrong lowers mortality 19% 65% pretty huge range. Usually give confidence interval like report sample average result study, upper bound!  Yes. called ""viral loading.""

Japan, Taiwan, Singapore Korea saying back January February, screaming whole world mask up. came repeated thing, based idea learning others, avoid mistakes, good thing.

And everyone downvoted said shit like idea applied severely immune-compromised individuals, like AIDS patients. said bullshit, can't learn Asian nations sort thing SARS-1? everyone downvoted cause mostly white Murican want wear masks, cause they're stuffy foreign-looking.

BTW, case anyone paying attention, past six months, January-July, nothing except dumb white westerners, especially dumb white Americans, burying hundreds thousands people we've arrogant, prideful, cocky, racist admit Asian nations knew right start. past six months basically nothing steady stream (white, western) researchers releasing data findings confirm Korea/Taiwan/Singapore/Japan group basically right everything.

Hundreds thousands people dead now, white people six fucking months late fucking party.

The information save people here, west refused listen it, cause like message (mask up!) resented messengers. Bmi standard right now, checking fat level would probably relevant I'm thinking PR r/WallStreetBets Ah, ""break something complain broken"". Classic. Plus old people taking money complaining pay taxes. good method sway persuade acknowledge people's concerns, might sound wild works. worth remembering people held ICE detention centers violated civil paperwork rule. illegal undocumented status criminal law. gained entry legally overstayed.

If ever jaywalked, committed crime merely status undocumented.

But we've kidnapped people, told rights, use rape sexual violence them, refuse abortions rape results pregnancy (regardless young girl is), feed rancid food.

For less jaywalking.

And international law, separation policy criteria genocide.

The detention facilities sanitation medical care often withheld. lead followers saying masks along they’ll start yelling pulling guns non-mask wearers. Trump try blame initial anti-mask rhetoric Fauci, CDC, WHO, surgeon general, etc. came say thing, without return room shut room matter air isn’t going get pulled back unit vents. There's masks laying side road right now. disgusting people care little others environment. probably ""push button, end study, we'll find ph2/ph3"". bad need move next phase broader participation. This. 1000%. I've saying months.

I work healthcare rarely see white upper middle class higher folks get really ill COVID. may partly due area/demographic work with, minorities poor definitely disproportionately affected COVID. one knows friends family batshit insane?

Seriously?

Like, thought everyone knew ""oh, that's Uncle Larry, he's got couple screws loose. ignore him"".  Rest peace realize UnHerd reputable, accurate, reliable site news information, right? news wrote like doomsday anxiety people even got worse.

Unfortunately, know several people completely stopped watching news due this. They'd prefer live blissful ignorance ""fear mongered"". means actual alert new information, even see it. Maybe repeat infractions, might find lot people cooporating remove excuse to, like mask, okay heres one, otherwise pay fine go home end may bad lessons world examining bad states done. thing happened March. running FB ads giving away free masks region started country.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Yes, they’re still barely testing - although they’re number reported Sunday, cases always lower. minor dip overall upward trend. mention Financial Times conservative ties, course it’s trying downplay virus. post right one literally says California reported record 12,000+ new cases. Nothing get excited hopeful about. Meanwhile, hospitalizations increasing reaching record highs. Even Moron onboard facemasks fucking delusional person believe wearing mask limits freedom. like girlfriend tells put condom risking getting dumb kids .. tell limiting freedom. Yeah. wonder BMI best look at. fat percentage? That's check ins far today... Spanish Flu infected third global population day. 50,000,000 people died, including 675,000 U.S. 143,000 alleged deaths (I know trust numbers anymore since they're longer reported CDC) we're 20% 1918 mortality total thus far. boss? Trump? guy tweeted pic mask today said patriotic wear one? ""Our best estimate right every case that's reported, actually 10 infections,"" Dr. Robert Redfield, director CDC

This statement equivalent ""90% infections asymptomatic"" stated. lack recorded cases. recorded cases symptomatic, not. unreported cases necessarily asymptomatic.

As said though, CDC already explicit communicating (more recently matters) believe 40%  Ants patients? Wtf? that, group suspended, fuel beliefs victims silenced conspiracy. ""persecuted"" are, right are. people truly unreachable. Maybe start site. Database mask deniers. see can't done middle ground thing.

Vitamin responsible immune system among things. 3000IU/day pretty high dosage. Typically take 1000IU/day, extreme deficiency doctor may prescribe 50,000UI tablets weekly use. 

All said, it’s middle summer Northern hemisphere, step yard.   Noob question -:if 95% asymptotic never get tested .which turn may project wrong data many people affected ? sons girlfriends whole family tested positive month ago, 5 members family including grandparents, they're fine nobody got really sick. They're negative now, son tested twice negative times. can't contagious sees girlfriend every damn day zero chance kept hands gives? Yea tf gym re-closed California. It’s dumb. People 35 years old aren’t even gym anymore. There’s high risk people gym. They’re closed reason. It’s hurting people aren’t risk all. Sir that's meant coronavirus funding. global shortage personal protection equipment underscored need carefully deploy masks would good, said argue there’s benefit anything,” said, “but given tool benefit right people risk virus frontline health workers exposed virus every second every day.”

How reading link? much ask. literally reinforces said: shortage average person efficient use limited healthcare providers can’t get care sick patients, puts communities risk! 

None links say wearing masks dangerous, say wearing shortage wasteful. Please stop spreading misinformation attempt justify ignoring health officials now.

You wrote quote: ""Was told to, would actually dangerous wear mask plane.""

This said *anyone* reputable. *lie* told. 104-year-old survived... want fucking NEAR anybody’s grandparent goddamn you. need get fucking field put padded room FAR away living. make adult film called viral load Welcome 2020 propaganda Well Canada building wall Americans pay it! 

And answer question, maybe elect people run country FEEL way MANY feel. 

Unfortunately idiots majority elected dont FEEL way many feel. God bless archaic voting system.

This one self entitled posts ever read. MANY self entitled whatever see fit gives fuck rest world. Wait sec, put mask hamster? inject course. air 


Hehe. aerosolizes. Woah hot shot. Showing fancy car I’m here. steam buggy, cranking start putting driving googles.  smart wait vaccine? memory, people get narcolepsy swine flu vaccine 2017? wear cotton mask public. results, factors exposure time spent potential infectious area, distance infectious source, hence there's 6 foot recommendation distancing, there's encouragement stick necessities shopping.

I really like two homemade ones point would prefer work latest batch surgical masks. much prefer tie behind forget kind masks. Uneducated users touch fiddle mask, basically giving reason keep touching face either infecting themselves, infecting others.

Then educate them. solution problem never ""fuck it, people never learn, let's give up"". That's dumbest fucking argument.

Also, soggy? I've never mask get soggy.

It always cut dry. Masks make difference. willing see that, that's you, hate people like willing reject masks perfect. Please, fuck off.  bike helmet analogy isn’t good won’t cause people fall crack skulls same. neglect bike helmet, you’re imposing risk yourself. is, obviously, true wearing mask. really, starters Avian flu similar one already circulating past 10 years. Two, \~1million far inferior medical climate year span; SARS-COV-2 reached less 6 months far wilder spread rate far longer effects. climate vastly superior medical technology, telling H3N2 days, mortality rate base secondary treatment would staggering hot spots even luke warm spots.

Then again, sounds pretty dumb. one said “Don’t shop stores requiring masks” favorite don’t want person store either. parents got coronavirus recovered ok. still sick 4 months since mid March. probably high viral load nyc  According CDC masks 14 randomized controlled trials measures support substantial effect transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza. similarly found limited evidence effectiveness improved hygiene environmental cleaning. identified several major knowledge gaps requiring research, fundamentally improved characterization modes person-to-person effect hand hygiene combined face masks laboratory-confirmed influenza statistically pooled analysis, found significant reduction influenza transmission use face overall reduction ILI laboratory-confirmed influenza cases face mask group significant either household studies reported significant reduction secondary laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections face mask systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed find evidence surgical-type face masks effective reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either worn infected persons RCTs hand hygiene face masks support substantial effect transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza, limited evidence available environmental measures Mourning happen we’re “out pandemic” much be. don’t much mental emotional energy grieve right guess gotta think lot bots closest pre exposure prophylactic. Basically take drug days exposure prevents infection (drug stops virus reproducing effectively exposure turn infection). Vaccinations need much less often.

Still useful risk groups. something give everyone case. think skipped murder hornets. I'm virologist I've telling people since January. people common sense. They're getting downvoted clearly know hell they're talking about. mean you’re looking fact recently Australia minimal community spread. Well intelligence true normal distribution they're thing. even debate masks gloves? country MONTHS ago zero cases (that quarantine facilities coming overseas). Get program, world. Sooner better.  virus reaching mucus membrane like nasal cavity eyes still mechanism infection?

This exactly case. COVID-19 targets ACE-2 receptors found mucous membranes eyes, nose lungs. gene codes also located X chromosome, would explain men higher risk (we one copy gene). receive data send them.

Something must sent somewhere. would (or anyone else) know contact someone later tested positive? Data must sent central server somewhere kept order actual ""tracing"". Then, ideally, would receive information might infected. Stop telling people deadlier influenza start telling deadlier measles. Approximately 3 times deadlier. People respect dangerous flu need different disease compare virus to.  Id like nominate select few:
Gates
Fauci

[Oh paper suggests long term T-cell immunity thing Covid recovery measure immunity appears present people prior exposure viruses similar proteins.

You guys naive never learn history. would literally another tsa deal, useless safety measure put place proven cause harm good. Yeah...right. efficiently. Much needed good news! returned work.. wish school bus driver..  COVID right always wear mask well. symptoms mild, chills, body ache, headache, nausea. also second week quarantine, ends Friday symptoms almost nonexistent. haven’t fever breathing/coughing problems all. 

Feeling super lucky mild it’s hoping nothing changes next days! end spectrum seeing significant increase severity people get virus intimate partner? imagine viral load intimacy someone infected would massive sort signal pretty obvious epidemiologists.

Good thing cautious! minor case manageable OCD so, I'm aware situation right now! goal right stay negative. I'm looking virus, understand could become infected. I'm taking precautions. can't necessarily lock house. really great independent living situation. I'm living people come go, try look symptoms stuff. God, mess. Hope best prepare worst!

Consistently stated evidence yet success general public dramatic global shortage poor countries. always encouraged East Asian countries continue use cultural norm. Yeah who'd want almost covid free country. Yep he’s totally snake. headline pretty much written black white (safe Covid-19 not) obviously it’s safer.

From article:
“The wealthy interested Caribbean islands self-isolate sandy beaches. They're looking Australia New Zealand, countries impressed handling Covid-19.” can’t image peaceful roll out. lottery system birthdate, age, location? going murders get first, looting try steal it, stabbings line? Hope sorting NOW. Ah, you’re right. It’s accurate positive, negative. :/

There molecular rapid test, though doubt it’s easy find. KNOW RIGHT?? drives insane! people apologized wear mask(while wearing mask) people saying thank working pandemic. Actually one thanked working pandemic. hate TN. kind business work access testing everyone easily? wish company going on. Towel door! fun fuck next 6 months. I'll ride bikes ski float rivers freinds. best part left quickly ditch people. republican, everybody would know name would bring every day pardoned. Republicans would campaigns yelling leftists locking veterans served child patriot. 

Liberals however got needed moved on. let's future liberals know left can't bothered defend fight cause long there's expectation we're good. Remember guys vote. takes win democracy. Show check box.

Liberals ultimate fuck chuck odd since one earlier hotspots back New York thing. think state learned Albany GA 2 funerals sparked all. Yes, I'd say so. Maaaaye Menards might before. Ok wasn’t point. point many people lack empathy understanding struggling right instead going demanding support sit sub say “stay FuCk HomE It’s HarD” even though actually quite hard many people.  executives safely sitting home wants busy counting cash. body count it. I'm virologists I've telling people also since common sense. something never paid attention admittedly since I'm chemical engineer. lockdown ruled unconstitutional well immediately lifted.

Just clear, lock place quite awhile ultimately got lifted couple weeks either due lifted extended again. believe would extended, Republicans took away additional restrictions could left place aid much safer ""re-opening"".

Now numbers back steady rise disproportionate increase testing. Ughhhhh can't wait November We’re kind places mask wearing prevalent economy open. live NY, that’s basically case here. still avoid places there’s crowds unavoidable close contact, would surprised we’re exposed incredibly small residual “doses” virus. Im Canadian fuck. 

You entitled opinion simply wrong. 

Quit job forced way MOL takes side unless guy working next contracts covid 19 identified employer. Considering people work corrections Florida people color, that’s racist. Right, allowed collect potential strikes it’s literally allowed constitution. constitution also stipulated penalties so. 

So unless amend state constitution, stuck *wikicoma* ? No...I didn't. understand math. 3.3 deaths per million even neighborhood 3.3% death rate. Read slower next time make sure understand talking look like this. -Mr. Mouse (ha-HA!) People straight get scientific data practices actually conducted. know enough viruses able go working knowledge make choices. Fine, ban interstate leisure travel. coworker planning ""just fun"" trip Florida soon (we're side country). need happen. Ugh I’m tired ignorant beings calling virus ‘flu’ ‘cold’. logic literally killing thousands thousands innocent lives actually read watch news stay informed. PANDEMIC cold, many times repeated hicks understand!??! Despite said sub early on, recent studies shown South Korea wasn’t actually catching cases. hardest hit city, caught 8 percent cases. 

That’s 92 percent cases contact tracing data on. can’t contact trace backwards, leaves huge percentage known infected idea became infected. Thank corrupt ""pro business"" supreme court, including guy lost retention election landslide. 18 coronas... bud lights. corona light get lesser dosage. even read original comment? specifically said think schools remain closed. **never** said, implied, risks staying closed outweigh risks staying open. seriously believe public administrations pay bills pocket money? Tbh know use term ""viral load"" heavily entertained AIDs. So, I’m understanding this, resources potential strike it’s allowed? resources collected strike, specifically?

I agree guys rock hard place. think you’d win 90% organize, scary proposition. There’s lot lose either way. :( nothing 'worse'. simple math. 

US 100x infection rate. large chunk population thinks masks useless needed. Stupid people, shows death rate.

I don’t think schools open. think people need bit understanding big picture empathy people don’t luxury sitting couch day, every day. Ok, important grade school high school.
But college? usc Columbia, kids going living dorms classrooms. Wtf??!!  Sounds like weak ass virus can’t kil two even Yes. that, also, built country foundation slavery genocide. habit oppressing different us. horribly violent country, anywhere else even looks us funny people already saying go war. violence spread community well. may best economy that's died long time ago. probably would still decent *somebody* lower 75% taxes 1%, keep getting lower lower. 

Our culture expectations toxic. We've idea ""perfect household"" ""successful life"" shoved throat fail realize longer feasible. amount ppl used babysit would visibly upset house ""mess"" reality couple toys dishes sink sad. way people used keep household constantly clean, chores done consistantly, made home cooked meal everyday mom's stayed home! That's something everyone wants do, yet still hold standards. constantly feel like fail wonder many end anxiety depression.

Speaking of, allowed insurance companies inflate price medical care astronomical amount. Even economy decent, chances someone 7+k sleep test rediculous (that numbers test btw, someone says insurance, did. insurance paid $160 month company worked for, took care part still owed $1,200. time got laid racked 2k able pay off, hundreds had. worked year. go telling insurance makes affordable.) People die every day treatable conditions can't afford go Dr.

We also allowed price schooling go roof well underfunding public schools. raised belief long go college become anything want promised job field sure thing. Today, wanted go college I'd drown debt, guaranteed job promised longer exists. want get field, even entry level position, need experience. get experience? Unpaid internships, yet, need eat really work it? supposed pay debt get minimum wage job even cover rent?

Speaking housing. price housing disgusting unreasonable. studio apartment (literally room kitchen, closet bathroom) 1k, made $4 minimum wage state make rent one paycheck. half monthly wage would go rent, also worry transportation, (I can't drive due medical reasons, pay get around), phone bill, utilities, food. people scold able save? I'd $50 name end month! 

People claim proud get violent feel disrespect flag people fought pass homeless veteran street. People claim value life everything yet willing jail women abortion ignore suffering child foster care.

What *were* *are* two different things. People need wake realize fricked years ago instead defensive pretending we're still great, start trying make thought along.

Ah, perfect world... Right here, Cleveland, people used say “I love you” go drinking. Herd word. California taken steps mitigate raging pandemic, Florida actively encouraging spread. Cool story, rules apply covid-19. 

You absolutly refuse unsafe work heights,failed equipment,not proper Ppe place etc. 

But far MOL concerned evidence covid 19 workplace cannot refuse unsafe work environment isn’t considered “unsafe” point. 


Im plumber trade. refused unsafe work past. i’m telling gov’t see things way do.

Im speaking facts. Makes perfect sense. Someone gets shot 1 bullet leg less likely die someone got shot 100 sure COVID pre-set kill limit. Republican Supreme Court neutered governor. People Wisconsin spread virus please. One also travel safely. Say drive using car go camping isolate wear masks time around people. doable.  10 people house, one brings home infects 9, 90 percent cases caught home.    Well yeah shit. That’s taking precautions first place also good thing. Like live world we’re willing take little bit risk make things happen, even Europe already resumed soccer leagues weeks ago even though technically could result bad situatio. resulted great situation there’s reason indicate otherwise ironic totally predictable thing everyone wearing masks distancing, there’s less transmission virus’

Like, I’m adult. Work work. don’t get work done, bad things happen. don’t babysit I’m building trust me, building doesn’t magical enforcement abilities: people don’t work shift office.

I’m productive feel much better energized home flexibility set schedule day (I’m capable working right number hours, taking lunch, etc). Meager profits??? You’re talking economy here.

Ive poor well different times life understand even buying pop work something couldnt/shouldnt do. cant hate someone able afraid spend extra $ something usually access via library. honestly usually fear needing extra money incase something comes hold people back.

Love Library free things offer community. Always Christian church question. passengers wearing masks day 8. Long enough virus spread everyone infected. 

So no. wearing masks. wish people would understand hazards recirculated air, man. I'm sure don't, studies bit dangerous is. office remote since March start phasing people back building. normal day, 4,000 employees. say masks required except sitting desk spacing people six feet apart. dudes, matter recirculated air. majority people work company massively unhealthy, think happens lot people work office. see panning well.  Stupid fucking cunt. Would bonus hit mask surcharge bill! article absolute dumpster fire fear mongering click bait. Absolutely zero sources cited.

There middle ground, agree, *has* include children staying home safe.

The alternative unacceptable. schools reopen full even near full capacity spread multiply exponentially. Schools shut anyway, leaving parents face issue finding childcare. 

Even businesses close leaving families wondering they're going eat afford place stay. 

The economy suffer even seen already. 

Not mention suffer die lock correctly. reminds witch scene Holy Grail. many areas,compliance really low. It’s hyper-political many counties refusing enforce order. Nothing burger. idiots deal said, would die soon anyway, mostly old sick... Move on... Go work, send 7 yo school, sniffles. science shows 95% kids staying isolated home 4 months get sick. send school... /s Well said. much comes back rich seizing government, ruining dreams founders surely King England seized power back. individual voter, power usurped two-party system sides cater moneyed interests. court system filled appointees value corporate protection little people. still important vote lesser evils every election, lesser evils becoming evil passing election. Politicians levels deaf cries healthcare, higher education, housing, retirement, even basic food security affordability. issues don’t even trip radar days,and days do, unwinding earlier protections. need systemic change lift forgotten little guy, political promises make change end folly. 100 20 million much. even cancel vacation least. I'd settle affordable healthcare.

Edit: think controversial request, okay. Fuck guess. anti-maskers know wear there? saying, bet don’t money anyways.

Do people know U.S. could manageable too? 'relaxation stations' socially distance taking masks, site. Mostly they're outdoor, indoors air conditioning. Indoor sites take masks, ooookay.  I've officially found reddit's dumbest hot take! Would fly lot tickets suddenly cost 3-5 times much? barely cheaper taking train routes Europe, usually way comfortable majority routes.

I totally understand that, however, also means many us simply fly again. Either way. Well I'm English kicked us years ago. point, they've got chance beating China. Incivility? Wtf? Yep...like know actually stop people getting covid. &lt;-- That's big thing hopefully next phase vets out. Although immune response important 1st step. Look studies successful handling Covid see things common. dictatorships, socialist, etc. One voice, one message. What's really funny, EXACTLY PREDICTED happening China. saw called Draconian. even said, spread US similar nations able take necessary measures stop virus like type society. 


I want live countries. like living mine. But, specific situation paying price it. need accept 5-10 % population weak wear mask

You're going need footnote huge numbers. seen scientific reporting little mask affects breathing? Anyone thinks can't wear mask hospital. Dont need immunity long enough virus run vectors? vaccine works say 60% population, even lasts 6 months enough almost completely squash spread. revaccinate every year 2 3 years hopefully enough smother viral spread. That’s fantasy land reddit court...no sane legal system would ever charge manslaughter *you* dislike response. poor people, tragic. 

Meanwhile, there's fat, sweaty, orange fuck telling everyone young people get Covid-19, get sniffles. Fucking travesty.  find jobs basically tell people fuck wear mask? sounds like Walmart Health Ambassadors joke. virus? Yes is, end humanity, every single death put government kill count, I've lost mostly mother family point ( 4 5), every single death avoidable little effort powered be.
My point is, buy narrative killer impossible contain impossible prevent. sell everything could, lie feed you. 
It choice greed instead people end, lost both. No, drink Corona. Immunity carry brands real world. writer didn’t phrase well fear every essential worker...and now, non-essential worker.

I really feel bad folks. virus detected people started wearing masks. GREAT NEWS! 

Remember incubation period still able transmit virus 14 days. first fever reported. many people went without fevers ASYMPTOMATIC spreading virus person said fever?

That’s like wearing condom got girlfriend pregnant. Useless. get scared go back work. alternative? aware charter schools tuition free right? suspected covid March, much fatigue everyday get bed maybe hour two day. fucking swell. That's starting change. Schools lost stomach this. North Idaho also starting show lot cases.  Gillum ended floor Miami Beach hotel, nude unconscious, drug orgy well know gay stripper Miami. people wonder DeSantis won? bigger question that’s playing subreddit every day. 

The pandemic could go another year two - possibly longer (hopefully moment end sight). Restricting travel leisure activities long untenable many people. us comfortable travel taking reasonable measures stay safe. beat submission. Governments need voluntarily downloaded app track you. live here? shit outside every day. can't throw rock without hitting someone either ice fishing (during winter), cornhole-ing, drinking, *every* season. People gather like iron filings magnet everything. related increased testing?

/s Agreed, Texan damn embarrassed Trump lackey Governor Lt. Gov. govmnt people sociopaths. get wrong, governments wasteful stupid every day.  people need police force follow law. follow law.  case, governments police ""fucktards"". people refusing wear masks. Place blame belongs.

\^\^ Upvote this. wearing masks fucking though? lol weve seen comments, many many people dont believe that. Perception issur just... go work? key takeaway. became mandatory again, well, starting Friday. supermarkets etc. Guess know one Four Horsemen really It’s going happen. Swedish cases going up. Deaths ICU cases going constantly since april. Mitch stated #1 priority several times,

 *Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell focused on* [*corporate *for weeks, warning looming lawsuits related coronavirus could crush nation’s recovery efforts going forward.* 

*"" McConnell thanked fellow \[edit\] Sen. John Cornyn Texas “thinking proactively issue legal liability.”  ""* noted Cornyn individual recently said, *“No one age 20 died coronavirus. still don’t know whether children get transmit others.”*  

Legislation prevent individual legal recourse companies negligence results becoming ill dying might ""slow economic recovery"" alternative faster recovery expense individual lives.

This one biggest issues facing American workers IMO. Yes know facing many great issues pandemic (death, illness, recession, eviction); legislation lasting impact nation ""recover"" sets tone value life vs. corporate profit. think ""bailouts"" bad enough; want jobs become death sentence. 

We know meat packing plants, working Vegas, working bars mask, etc put employees risk. would tragedy affected say made work unsafe conditions responsible conditions responsible. time local school district open! Ugggg Next week: study fines exact opposite Sure. question is, people downstate commute Cook county work? That's I'm talking about. problem downstate counties later phases. work 11 areas instead 4 retail restaurants suburbs obviously lobbied included Cook County still run businesses possible expense public health commuter cities. Specifically DuPage county, probably Oakbrook mall wants indoor dining. see carved map, obvious happened there. 

Bars indoor dining problem Cook country honestly, affects everyone cook county 8 hours per day. literally almost much home county, plus 45 minute train ride way breathe shared air commuter cars. make sense public health standpoint makes total sense several restaurants fine endangering public protect investments. 

Lol I'm rich person. could never like already millions dollars. thing would make desperate enough go public health pocketbook needed food family. world, make choices. chose close business high risk employees customers. could fought keep open decided people get sick, hey that's family, problem. lInEs sHoRt! Ofc still ignored it, wanna admit wrong doubled persisted believing delusions. That's got pet industry imagine lip service groomer. I've telling people likely vaccine till like fall 2021... pinning hopes one sooner bad mental health. Apparently makes antivaxxer somehow lmfao seems knocking dads more. Probably lot single mothers. poor women. I'm talking playing fans. I'm concerned thst. Also areas high school sports free watch know thats different South Regardless locked for, US moral legal obligation follow humane procedures. whole idea people commit atrocities human rights violations think they're bad enough needs stop. This!

WHO said evidence scientists time, true.  yet evidence it. 

Fauci one actually recommended masks - told short PPE wanted first responders. covid? rate America going, wont medical Bill's hand health care system likely collapse. states right edge already as? got mine, care 'bout yours

is pretty much US motto point... Italy is, way, already net positive contributor EU balance. One biggest ones. Always been. since southern Europe \*has\* sucking money north according ignorant idiots. 

## Abstract

## BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) associated diffuse lung damage. Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury thereby reduce progression respiratory failure death.

## METHODS

In controlled, open-label trial comparing range possible treatments patients hospitalized Covid-19, randomly assigned patients receive oral intravenous dexamethasone (at dose 6 mg daily) 10 days receive usual care alone. primary outcome 28-day mortality. Here, report preliminary results comparison.

## RESULTS

A total 2104 patients assigned receive dexamethasone 4321 receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) dexamethasone group 1110 patients (25.7%) usual care group died within 28 days randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.75 0.93; P&lt;0.001). proportional absolute between-group differences mortality varied considerably according level respiratory support patients receiving time randomization. dexamethasone group, incidence death lower usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 0.81) among receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 0.94) among receiving respiratory support randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 1.55).

## CONCLUSIONS

In patients hospitalized Covid-19, use dexamethasone resulted lower 28-day mortality among receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation oxygen alone randomization among receiving respiratory support. (Funded Medical Research Council National Institute Health Research others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.gov number, [NCT04381936. opens new tab](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04381936); ISRCTN number, [50189673. opens new tab](http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN50189673).) ah yes, let’s slow testing people aren’t capable entertaining way taken care 🙄 Particularly small business owners qualify unemployment. genuinely small business owner (so like NBA billion dollar business got millions feds), getting 0 aid. already scraping fucked. know several sole proprietors brink losing everything including homes / apartments point. close business together they'll 0 income 0 aid. they've already burned savings. 

Our government fucking people over. time, businesses staying open putting public health risk. It’s fucking common sense.

Common sense reliable indicator outcomes. fact strong compulsion accept common sense hinderance scientist benefit. protesting next thousands people okay going church allowed? Ok then. Look graph excess deaths year compared last 5 years.  Two Arizonans several advocacy groups filed federal complaint argues state's crisis standards, allowed COVID-19, discriminate older Arizonans, people color disabilities.

The crisis standards guide allocation scarce resources patients based factors as their likelihood survival. Arizona Department Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ June 29 [authorized state activate standards needed.

The protocols Arizona's [Crisis Standards standards putting Arizonans risk ""imminent harm,"" says 20-page July 17 complaint Roger Severino, director Office Civil Rights U.S. Department Health Human Services.

 
The complainant asks Office Civil Rights review Arizona ""Crisis Standards Care"" addendum, ""to ensure discriminatory decisions regarding allocation life-saving medical care occur Arizona.""

Longstanding discrimination people disabilities people communities color U.S. health care system led higher rate underlying health conditions lower life expectancy among groups, complaint says. reason, complaint says, triaging people based life expectancy inherently unfair.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey's office aware complaint, spokesperson Patrick Ptak wrote email.

""Our priority ensuring Arizonans access medical care, case,"" Ptak wrote. ""Arizona hospitals capacity triaging care — hospital point outbreak triaged care.""

## Two individuals disabilities part complaint

The crisis standards offer potential people disabilities being ""erroneously perceived shorter life expectancy,"" says complaint, filed Arizona Center Disability Law, Arc Arizona, Arizona Center Law Public Interest and Native American Disability Law Center.

 
Several disability civil rights groups signed support, including American Civil Liberties Union Arizona Bazelon Center Mental Health Law.

In addition disability civil rights groups, complaint filed two individuals, Arizona residents — Donna Jeffrey, 47, muscular dystrophy, Joseph “Joey” Zachary, 27, cerebral palsy. outlived medical providers' original estimates and worried hospitalized with COVID-19, life expectancy would similarly misjudged.

The Arizona Crisis Standards Care addendum document ""place many people disabilities, older adults, people communities color, significant risk harm, possibly death,"" says complaint, filed U.S. Department Health Human Services July 17.

""These protocols offer potential systemic systematic discrimination vulnerable populations across Arizona provision healthcare, including represented individuals organizations party complaint.""

## Arizona ranks second U.S. COVID case rate

Although original crisis standards document addendum contain general prohibitions using race age justify de-prioritizing care, complaint argues addendum contains several provisions could lead discrimination people disabilities, older Arizonans and individuals communities color.

Factors evaluation one- five-year mortality could easily lead discrimination communities color because, example, Black people statistically shorter life expectancy white people, complaint states.

""Further, accurate predictions life expectancy five years extremely difficult normal circumstances, context pandemic expedited triage decision-making occur, nearly impossible,"" complaint says.

Christ told reporters June 29 that allowing hospitals activate standards ""proactive step.""

“It gives hospitals framework allows determine get short resources, allocate those,” Christ said time. beginning experts saying 18 months? Shhh you’re disrupting narrative Church employees still pay income taxes taxes taken paychecks. program protect income individuals. individuals pay taxes, benefit? believe so, notifications contact anyone know sure.

Edit: track location all. However Android requires location access enabled use Bluetooth detection.

From apps faq:

Why app Android devices require access location?

In order SwissCovid app work access Bluetooth, Android devices activate location function. Bluetooth sharing coupled location sharing. means location function activated even SwissCovid app never access location via satellite positioning That's encouraging hear! 5 year old wears one well tried hour. (And way still breathing able live end hour masked, imagine that, Facebook moms.) Kind both. lot testing done before, US would still rank near top countries even adjusted tests per million. Like said, pay loan back since pay taxes. want people lose jobs, wrong pay taxes get free shit. one thing disabled, mentally ill welfare, receiving aid. Ya know? Sorry I’m supposed I’m educated enough argue this. 

Anti mask wearers see doctor cites several sources. correct response this?  No, first need determine immune response protective begin with... wish less media attention around phase trials vaccine candidates. Phase III learn efficacy case it’s even challenge trial. Unleash pls 😆  mentioned book/movie post. Interesting... cost benefit? masks 100% effective, there’s decision make. You’d wear one never look back. they’re 90% effective, you’d still probably wear outweighs negatives. they’re 5% effective?

And on. 

Not taking side comment, understand side well. 

Wearing bike helmet good job keeping cracking open head. aren’t likely fall walking, wearing helmet anytime you’re walking concrete pretty silly, don’t. riding bike increases chance you’ll fall, decide it’s hassle wear then. 

Remove social pressure you’re helping others wearing mask (which pretty much first time us exposed idea) you’ll maybe understand people aren’t excited wear mask time. Maybe they’d wear one situations willingly, decide risk cases isn’t worth hassle. 

I don’t understand people think way must live trailer parks neglecting children. absent, actively common sense coronavirus policies clearly understanding problem here. benefit tax money pay taxes all.  person know came contact? It’s considered polite drive thru

But Canadians wouldn’t know sort thing would eh. Oh god, virus millions coronavirus sized ducks? starting make sense... Ah, understood. thinking starting point still makes big difference growth ends up, whether eradicated quickly, suppose still limit exposure cohabitating partners. Thanks clarification!  Rotten cherries. Careful jokes flip switch microchip /s one like straight DPRK statement: ""our great patriotic leader fighting imperialist virus!"" masks wearing, outbreak occurred, 95% infected asymptomatic.

Does mean asymptomatic patients breathe less amount virus?

The study says inhaled less amount virus due wearing masks, thus said so? Would make difference second infection mutated version virus? keep hearing immunization vaccination defeated mutation. I'm getting tested tomorrow, anyone tips help discomfort? tips appreciated ( usually get really anxious anything doctor related)  rub body. Vape it. Whatever. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’d rather keep wearing mask get mild/asymptomatic case couple times (at most) vaccine available. problem restrictions interstate travel. would different. exactly said that!? pull quote thin air? Best example leading behind seen while. beginning said vaccine would take least 18 months develop. I'm sure changed.

This March: problem ""how enforce mandate"" think theres really good government solution this, cant lock thousands pandemic risky, hell probably cant even give due process law order fine them. Legalized street justice workable scalable option think would actually work Yes data indicating transmission via surfaces nearly big threat originally thought. Still take basic precautions need leave groceries box porch 3 days like people saying before.

I studies handy topic came early June want look more. Don’t forget Mexico... deniers fearmongers kind joined together ruin chance “viral load” thing people took seriously. mask filter virus. helps trap large water droplets contain virus. wear mask prevent spreading, defend it. you’re exposed lot people (I’m japan) everyone wears mask ? devil's jockstrap complete 5G LTE nose antenna

:-) got bro. shitty everyone soonish get back normal life lastly breath stated “fuck teachers” might mistake believe welcome enter Canada. simply wrong, lying. Dr. Fauci said so. knew anyhow, lying public hoard PPE. 3 minute video here.         
Editorial based 3 minute video:       
*""Anthony Fauci admitted decision downplay use masks calculated lie.""* 😅😂🤣🤣🤣😂😜😜😅 see inject bleach drink it!! difference reducing chance infection reducing intensity infection. 

He wrong. 100%! It’s what’s important want take vaccine bad. Please tell get much social distancing. needs practice preaches. I’m going argue hopping one foot hour isn’t really equivalent participating online class. You’re equating “go school” punishment life can’t wrap head around that. kid fucked made bad decisions. That’s totally okay, we’ve done that. fact judge made point order participate, whatever verbiage used, online classes wonderful. That’s step forward sending right bat white-halled “treatment” facility. It’s addressing problem. 

The judge threw kid bone didn’t keep half bargain. need lockdown reduced income, lay staff? still people jobs, PPP loan cover that, hence name paycheck protection program. Even small viral load still deadly high risk populations, especially elderly immunocompromised people. healthy people could also get moderate severe infection expose people high viral load. 

A real vaccine kinda option doesn’t expose active version virus. Arlington Cemetery highly recommend it. Graves soldiers far eye see every direction. extremely humbling.

Covid, official numbers, would fill third Arlington cemetery US deaths alone.

Go there. See graves, think that. That’s lot cherries picked, fourteen different studies say thing, masks don’t work Back old reddit didnt save. text posts (without tricking it). Here's tough question (it's actually reality): 

99% people around wear mask talks lot sometimes cough/sneeze. closed room. chance survival? piece get. Large numbers sick and/or terrified people make good shoppers, matter much hucksters shills cry come back stores restaurants bars. low iq types course so, people won't. matter many widgets make one buys them. Wall street will, course, fine.  Yet EU stronger standards data collection that's socialism. serious note though, tracing apps protect privacy least Swiss one does. 

You generate random code every 15 min save codes 2 weeks. Anyone contact gets code time. confirmed outbreak, government gives activation code app flag sick codes two weeks get flagged. everyone one codes saved notified. central database tracking movements local phone.

If there's anything else going tracking, idk. know lot effort put privacy. know, Japan low numbers weekends workers go rest fewer tests done. case, misunderstood. happens, I'm really advocate war scenarios. fact remains, however, helped countries part commonwealth. Therefore, reasonably argued duty give countries preferential treatment we're position offer something substantial. pure pragmatism, recognition responsibilities, gratitude and, ultimately, nothing whatsoever Nationalism. UwU  use coconut oil treat covid? eat straight up? Lather it? substitute regular cooking oil this? makes feel better, us listened. we're wondering information circulating, last 4 months, like brand new news.

Edit: know ""new news"" redundant. Kind like repeating ""wear mask protect others"" ""the majority transmissions asymptomatic people"" redundant, necessary vast group people listen. I'm advocating wearing masks, everyone patient, patient doctor wearing mask.

I use argument people point they're healthy want wear mask, they're putting patient (everyone themselves) risk. can't even get folks wear masks without pulling guns. think really depends church denomination. raised Catholic also went Catholic K-12. Catholic schools tied one Catholic Parish/Church. definitely number staff. local small town Woodland, CA employing 3-4 priests, couple deacons, custodian services Church Parish Halls/Community Centers. there's main office, handles administration, usually 5 folks; people come hear everything, registering Catholic Faith Formation (for kids go Catholic school need get Sacraments), registration weddings, baptisms, first communions, etc. school depending size employees lot staff teachers, many public schools. Parish rolls diocese even admin staff. 

I can't speak Christian denominations, Catholic churches pretty admin staff heavy. little late. 

I wanna break up.  LOT harder ban people leaving place ban entry destination. dont even know legal framework could used, effectively placing whole state arrest, absolutely people slipping boat via backroads. 

Banning visitors something done varying extents kind situations, varying degrees success, generally feasible least extent.

Also, first cases actually nursing home WA, random undiagnosed cases floating around country, testing ID them. Banning travelers NY might bought 2 weeks, maybe 3 feeling charitable. Spread within community needs one case lack testing/contact tracing/mask social distancing begin taking off. ♥️ Earlier, advising general mask usage, Facebook censored pro-mask messages, attempts distribute masks (as donations, free). literally stopped giving masks community start respiratory pandemic.

 issue stores open, entice trips contacts overall. Like, someone wants go spend 45 minutes Walmart buy food, socks, sparkly phone case, ""Live Laugh Love"" framed print, would go Walmart, plus Kohls Five Below, resulting three 15 minute visits? would revert old ways browse 10 stores spending 2 hours total? make sure don’t share data CDC. 
That sort thing looked upon nowadays. There's bit difference though. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) something lot people survived first SARS retained debilitating disease severely limit person's ability lead normal life. yet time figure standard post-recovery fatigue actual chronic problem people remotely give anybody moral cause flippantly assume ""less bad"" option. Honestly, I'm really concerned anyone family actually *dying* COVID-19. 

But I'm *really* fucking concerned permanent organ damage, lung scarring, heart muscle damage, even brain damage clots resulting COVID-19.

I think levels government U.S. support recall elections. provides method remove elected official office term expired. 

However, common approach elect someone different next normal democracy political hacks would dragged office much harm public health overall health country.

What would point ""normal democracy""? seen approach used?

I *think* democratic governments often associated peaceful transition power. Dragging officials offices sounds like tribal frameworks authority.

Certainly open learning examples normal democracies dragging people office. I'm expert topic. deleted post whilst middle replying, hope mind post reply here.

Of course they'd choose India, that's way programmed think government/media. truth told actually know anything either country. Never never likely to, information comes media. guarantee India powerful country China still shithole, would India would ""enemy"" right now.

China lot problems, lack free press one important mind, although wish American media them. way portrayed Western press diabolical clearly done purpose.

Source: employee refuse perform work based COVID-19 pandemic?

It possible COVID-19 pandemic may create basis legitimate work refusal. employee’s right refuse perform work result COVID-19 contingent upon factors including (but limited to) following:

the state COVID-19 situation worker’s particular city, region, province workplace time refusal work exercised;
the age health specific worker;
the type workplace worker usually performs functions;
the specific field work normal duties tasks;
the number workers workplace whether social distancing possible;
the measures adopted employer prevent transmission COVID-19, including workplace hygiene personal protective equipment (PPE), applicable;
whether employee employer diagnosed COVID-19;
whether worker circumstances fall one legislative exceptions right refuse unsafe work; and
any factually relevant considerations assessing whether hazard, risk, danger, etc. upsetting half population country freaking stupid.  type blood test antigen test, antibody test. Antigen test diagnose current infections, whereas antibody test suggest possibility past infections. know studies accuracy antigen tests. Soviet Russia vaccine makes need representative sample. inconsistent, US studies designed fail beginning. HCQ antiviral needs administered early disease. Go back look studies, giving patients 3+ days hospitalization way late antiviral matter. also using like, 5x recommended/safe dosage...so...yeah. 

You'll notice studies shown good results it, started HCQ early disease progress, precisely needs administered effective. know thus drug inconsistent.

It's safely used 60 years, well known studied. US studies largely garbage. Look stuff coming SEA, India, EU, etc. HQC studies done areas shown successful. miracle drug anything effective enough warrant giving people. feeling point going negative naught. used PTO get sick future might screwed. also see would discourage people getting tested show symptoms. OH NO! ECONOMY! addressed months ago. little late. Can't cry got venereal disease and/or girl got pregnant forgot refused wear condom. Take proper precautions mitigate risk front.

Yet people cried lockdown, places opened soon, people complain wearing mask social distancing like they're oppressed instead trying keep everyone safe. Every place locked 6 weeks, wear masks, social distance, proper hygiene, discussion.

Patients hospital need immediate person care. can't get around that. People need buy food, albeit could mitigated better curb side and/or online ordering food. I'm surprised prevalent. Kids going class miss education, crucial.

If parents rely school daycare probably need rethink priorities. I'm single / sole parent two elementary aged kids. I'm taking financial hit staying home, probably gonna work I'm 80 borrowing retirement funds, savings already dried up. I'd rather broke healthy, working risk getting teachers, myself, parents sick dead.

So many schools plan open safely. That's problem. also hoped would go away without kind plan didn't. Government stomps feet open schools, yet solution ""oh, well, many schools can't follow proper guidelines, to.""... even proper?

Bottom line, poor planning, poor leadership, general population rebelling science, people wonder millions infected, hundreds thousands complications, sinking economy, 140,000 dead, cry schools need stay open.   Mine came unmarked envelope 1 piece paper Visa debit card. truly believe wouldve thrown away didnt read article reddit. never occured wouldnt check since every single form payment get government (tax refunds etc) either direct deposit check. also think tough judge credit card companies send cards constantly get sign getting one isnt even something notice anymore.  Florida man stories sell California man stories. Except media politicians cite situation improving Imagine applied mask logic driving cars. ""You can't force wear seatbelt obey traffic laws get license drive. free drive car brakes want. Freedoms!"" going strike? USA, pinnacle capitalism dude amusing imagining going jungle briefcase full cash handing hunter gatherers like “dafuq?” realize rental agencies often cars state plates right? Guy work died March. told us within hours death, ""Wasn't COVID!""

Okay, healthy guy 30s respiratory problems, bad cough, high fever, tested negative flu strep dies heart attack telling us COVID there's enough time test come back?

I mean, maybe wasn't, can't definitely say 4 hours passed. tests took days come back then. problem. people lot subs try say positivity rate lower since state says also count extra multiple negatives person. reality, count once. look Johns Hopkins Covidtrends testing numbers lower state positivity rate much higher. matches calculations. Plus John Hopkins know positivity since everywhere. Florida likes make positivity lower. There's article talks ""Florida’s hidden data skews COVID-19 test results"" here's link count positive test once,” Alina Alonso, head Palm Beach County Department Health, told Palm Beach County commissioners July 7.“[**We count negative tests reasons people testing negative getting multiple test results. positives name captured once,” said.That means person multiple negative tests counted several times. Yeah people think sun's UV disinfect kill coronavirus wildly mistaken. UVC one powerful enough kill horribly dangerous humans. Fortunately ozone layer absorbs UVC sun claim even true. Cherry picking poor studies.

Key points remember:

\-- Studies mask wearing difficult ethically. Since ethically expose people live virus randomized controlled trial (except rare situations)

\--Studies typically use viruses rather corona, making tough really draw conclusions.

\--It's difficult get people wear masks studies. can't actually expose people live virus test masks work, need trust people use masks. example, one study frequently cited anti-mask people involved dorms University Michigan. Sounds interesting find kids wear masks classes besides dorms. went spring break study.

\--Studies often fall back medical workers. fine goes, much like environment live work in. normally exposed virus hours day. makes conclusions hard draw.

Absent actual challenge trials using SARS-Cov-2, see vaccine earliest ever, best source data based retrospective studies areas mask don't. several already confirm mask wearing appears correlated lower transmission. Considering suspect largely spread droplets, makes intuitive sense well.

There many people Twitter social media like poster. They've collected lots poor studies, better. . still true though. Surely numbers getting close. Mortality 28 days significantly lower dexamethasone group usual care group, deaths reported 482 2104 patients (22.9%) 1110 4321 patients (25.7%), respectively (rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 0.93; P&lt;0.001) (Figure 2A). prespecified analysis according level respiratory support patients receiving randomization, trend showing greatest absolute proportional benefit among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (11.5 chi-square test trend) (Figure 3). **In dexamethasone group, incidence death lower usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation** (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 0.81) receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 0.94) (Figure 2B 2C). **However, clear effect dexamethasone among patients receiving respiratory support randomization** (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 1.55) (Figure 2D). 

Seems like dexamethasone limited efficacy general treatment protocol unless patient already respiratory support (just highlighting relevant bits folks). Nothing numbers suggests improvement think key still amazes hospitals LA exploded patients.

Amazing. sounds like someone "" forgot"" add back daily briefings email distribution group...

A lot North Eastern states business requirements travel already it’s farce anyone get them. Literally need signed statement business owner matter small stating business travel needs state. 

Look I’m traveling anywhere plans catching monster putting non effective closures place accomplish nothing make headlines politicians pointless. Except neither article proves claim. Bernie Sanders democrat, national election time. DNC even changed rules 2020 still got wiped. Maybe it’s message hell bent *conspiracy*.

That's okay. they've done, anywhere hide. like leave planet. looks like testing plateau [we Floridians see cut-off points separating central Florida north south Florida? Jailed US defending it. signed up... anything help. Thanks OP posting. Means saying anything mods agree with.  Fyi folks: 

this user’s entire history slippery slope trolling. tell homemade cute cotton masks going anything.

Even faced science facts still deny.

And since medical professionals anything material science? Isint kind engineering thing? New England Republicans Democrats want lower taxes, culture war ended decades ago. Yeah, feel way. I'm social person time mentally exhausting keeping Facebook family crap.

My dad like that, dont need others ass, talk matters. value relationship much higher most. He's old fashioned, though, think got gene.

I'm never going fit totally connected world. Given level investment holding Olympics, seems like nearly expense testing/vaccines/protocols would worthwhile order able hold games.

Japan already spending $20+ billion games. Even spending $3-5 billion COVID would worthwhile ensure first $20 billion wasted.

With level investment, think perfectly reasonable think could pull off--even spectators attendance. facebook senior community LOL Anxiety real disorder people suffer from. Sounds like dont it. Good you. something people easily control diagnosed such. truly ignorant. isn’t meant. 

There’s something makes virus burn own, don’t know is. 

Several studies done papers written lately trying figure WHY. seem rather silly, like one released day saying virus similar one much mild recently spread across world, providing cross-immunity. 

Then there’s little less silly, Oxford model correct virus lot less deadly much infectious originally thought. 

We simply don’t know right now. preprints trying explain what’s going on. opinion constantly send patients another state beds, MS doing, already overrun. course, state wants come admit that. I'm hobbit likes naps? Problem folks who'll probably live shortest year look back decisions realize fucked 30-40% country is. mean don’t order shelter place hurricane, order evacuation like complete opposite. Florida atleast usually state COVID-19 Outbreak Associated Air Conditioning Restaurant, Guangzhou, China, Montana one weird states would expect super red consistently votes Democrats certain positions like Governor Senator. 

Reminds home state Massachusetts blue supermajority statehouse usually red Governor.  like Pavlova, Phar Lap Crowed House? keep Russell Crowe. may zero protections forgery, athletes vaccinated, people attending too, element herd immunity protect sneak in. people sneaking going get sneakers. dad one ""those people"". said ""more people die car accidents! going do!? abolish cars!!?!?!!??!!!34rfe34093fhjfj""

im like ""you whacked dude"" lol Fully grown adult males still hate girl Positivity rate key here. Florida testing significantly less weeks ago.

19.8% positivity 47000 tests. 

A couple weeks ago hitting 60-70000 tests daily seemed. 

So surface looks like it’s getting better. they’re dialing back Thanks everything do! Since know lot things work, could give rough estimate think vaccine ready every time see different dates coming personally I’d rather social distance wear masks long needed take vaccine developed fast choice death death. stay home much possible, go necessary, maintain social distancing, wear masks public-- especially indoors. hunger disease serious problems. US anything like competent, compassionate, intelligent leadership, we'd beaten problem coronavirus months ago, we'd sending aid countries like Peru enable lockdown necessary, sending checks help people survive lockdown.

As American, I'm embarrassed. like think leaders free world, let rest world down. failure part consequences Peru, too. Thank bringing attention. know means nothing, behalf country, want apologize people country. expect better United States. wrong get sick infect others, I'm wrong suffer minor inconvenience. dick. person Americas hard ""Gawrsh Mickey, kinda like genocide?""

""Shut next."" part Amazon tribe guess might considered important. might even consider important you. Keep kids HOME! Yeah north Korea covid shut military three months unknown reason, definitely covid. Belarus rather similar hi covid agreeing ""president"" people dying lots pneumonia covid. Also Brazil recommendable sunny warm covid hoax. Raise morons buy Harvard building get admitted? Like said, basic needs yes need done.  Who's going tell eat lol l get groceries is. one guy another subreddit swearing wife nurse Houston hospital said cases, really didn’t. starts doubling saying HR given permission look staffing records look peoples names announcing hospitalizations, people didn’t really work there. Yeah, major hospital organization going let random nurse staff husband access HR records. Way many people commenting stuff like “I knew it. It’s scam.“ guy’s story wall silly. 😆 would useful know hospital number flat decease flat artificially  believe low number based less 500 tests. Facebook probably thought hoarding price gouging trying advertise business   children's health safety always come first. Shame willing sacrifice children protect themselves. I'm disappoint Marriott this. used consultant, hundreds stays Marriotts, lots points, elite status, etc.

I went vacation late june (I covid March I'm immune), definitely lying asses. specifically called hotel asked everything open, said yes. arrive 2 3 restaurants closed, third sellling pre-heated finger food. pool - promised open - closed. rooftop cocktail bar, closed. even get food drinks 1-5pm. room service cancelled (had go downstairs get toilet paper towers...and person them).

And, going on, even reduce prices. building empty, give upgrade even though status.

Oh none guests, employees bother wear masks (this South).

I get it, Covid going things difficult, lie people try atleast give basic customer service. would've went cheaper, local hotel knew would like this.  Well common knowledge point haha government job make people stay home without worrying starving losing homes like countries instead forcing people work. countries able great USA can't seem figure out? think it’s time general strike. Yes, countries paying/have paid citizens stay home also handling COVID better general... obviously remote learning would safest option fear it’s feasible lot people. odd occasion worn mask decorating work find hot damp uncomfortable, notice effect breathing. However take first opportunity planned work reduce time needed wear them. going happen it’s product doing. pushed hard protest didn’t cause spread theme parks using studies stay open. “Outside gatherings majority wearing mask causes spread? Ok that’s parks, open stay open”

Agenda thumping finally caught us. HUH US citizen defer experience obviously live there. US redistributed state wealth two centuries kinda assumed normal so. Wealthy regions support less wealthy regions.

What wary alert regions waste money. Redistributed wealth always used make regions prosperous, since allow money made back buisenesses.

Trust this, one common ways waste money. Good guys across pond paranoid it. half mask, non-reusable respirator, completely different. yes, looks like need valve airtight, unlike half masks. may, I'm unaware it. imagine voter turnout kids age already realized years dumb old dipshits them? And... she's... nurse. literal danger patients. cannot. seen damage disease caused line work? has, continues acting like this... I'm sorry sounds like living narcissist sociopath that's pretty scary itself. Either serious denial mortality acting it. Neither option really great there. I'm sorry situation.  Linkedin used reputable, stroke fest people wanting post achievements. emperor clothes, mask. I'm already single dad... poor kids. Adults act like kids Random people quarantine year. assign events really keen doing.

The people going amusement park putting risk-- endangering employees well. employees choice either risk getting infected &amp; spreading families able pay rent, food, etc. communicable disease impacted people willing take risk, care, actions impact people really choice matter. That's literally whole point article.

Even things like grocery store workers, everyone taking steps minimize risk well. I'm lucky live somewhere drive pickup groceries I've using entire pandemic. People Florida know different governor actively suppresses data covid-19 state level (not seems stopping anyone anyway).

Don't let state or, perhaps soon, federal government continue suppress data bypass CDC.

Mark still lives home Cuz he's got job 
Because rona freaking current wave going destroy country, let's keep little perspective. early hard-hit states, took 3-5 weeks cases reach peak. currently hard-hit states 4-6 weeks exponential growth, growth slowing significantly past week. likely we've already seen peak Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia, getting close California south. 

It took little longer wave since states lock down, two factors contributing similar trend time. First, immunity plays much bigger role many want admit, second, behavioral changes function personal risk assessment government mandate. outbreak happens, people become willing make changes like mask wearing help reduce personal risk. immunity behavioral changes rapidly dropping R 1 much country right now. 

By time school starting month, we'll tail end current wave. Expect another small wave children go back school, even smaller 2nd, immunity population provide effective block. rural states probably get hit worst ""3rd wave"" since school relatively large mixing event compared normal lives (relative less-rural states).

The peak deaths comes 3-11 days peak cases early states, trend likely continue current outbreak states. number deaths currently low considering current wave started 6-7 weeks ago. probably reach anywhere near scale spring wave.  wild thought, shut gyms statewide I’m completely agree, can’t bury head sand pin hopes one thing. case doesn’t work our, what? 

Realistically vaccine may general public Jan next year high risk/medical staff need first.

Someone thread thinks getting vaccine November, lol NY enforcing this? still need mass flow first thing note Covid-19 novel virus. completely new medical community feverishly studied scientists medical groups world. know, infer, precision going change refined, rapidly, data collected experiments performed. disclaimer way, let's actually answer questions.

First, surfaces. know far, Covid-19 last long surfaces; Somewhere day four days, depending material environmental factors like temperature humidity. Scishow excellent video subject early June ( ). 

So rate transmission low compared respiratory spread. zero. Touching surface recently contaminated still poses risk you. encounter virus increases initial infectious dose. easily virus spreads often infected person asymptomatic presymptomatic, can't know sure surface contaminated contaminated is. prudent wash hands often. Especially contact public.

Now masks. Basically, hear masks, really hearing three types masks: N90 medical-grade masks, surgical masks, homemade/commercial masks. N90 medical-grade masks ones often hear medical staff talk shortages. designed high specification, filter materials used air-tight seal around edges mask. stop viruses directions. result mask greatly reduces number viruses breathe well as, importantly, number viruses breathe in. importance latter cannot overstated since medical staff constantly contaminated environments Covid-19 highly contagious (far flu, heard otherwise). N90 masks must disposable design, medical professionals need lot currently facing shortage them.

Next surgical masks. disposable great preventing wearer spreading viruses pathogens, catching significant number get environment. lack air-tight seals features stop breathing contaminated air. still offer small amount protection viruses floating around environment, even small decreases exposure add significantly time. Though important factor surgical mask greatly reduce chance medical professional spreading disease asymptomatic presymptomatic.

Commercial homemade masks similar protection surgical masks. Like surgical masks, marginally effective protecting viruses air. However, like surgical masks, still significantly reduce chance spreading Covid it. latter professionals recommend everyone wears masks. way knowing sure someone infected Covid-19 way late stop person spreading it. preemptively wearing mask, combination measures, like social distancing, rates infections plummet. Additionally, amount viruses environment decreases significantly, help eventual cases milder instead deadly. total compliance, possible get infection rate low recovery rates overtake infection rates. 

For in-depth summary, check video Okay Smart ( ). works hurricans. Requiring IDs racist act violence. many.. included agency also said people deemed immune still act carriers virus society, must therefore continue observe social distancing hygiene guidelines.

That's really significant. It’s Idaho strategically important upcoming election.  guess realize current astronomical rise infections happened early-mid July

I'm sure agree maybe lockdown eg people going treatment conditions eg Heart Attacks, going difficult tease accurate data, also suspect majority Covid related deaths everyone ID.

I spend lot time working impoverished homeless free time IDs biggest barriers. Good thing one priorities senate make people couldn’t sue employers Poor areas stores common getting hit worse COVID. Dollar Tree Family Dollar pulling back they're going make situation way worse. One Florida comments section today lists numbers, 70k 40k testing wise average Joe buys products made industries, voted politicians whose job regulate environmental impacts industries have. Dixie Cups seems fine. said, Winn-Dixie's garbage stores even worse food enough damage reputation, already. honestly know they're still business. know, last time NZ shot straight past Coromandel driving Auckland Tauranga you’re really making regret decision.

Please get shit together, US. *need* go back north island month explore more. Maybe generally 5-10, varies individual regions (2x rural South Dakota, 13x Chicago). Gaza government 100% known mislead completely fabricate events

And BB prime minister Israel lying POS point whoever's signing go convention basically joining death cult, ""don't dead"" like, opposite beliefs. Can't strike? theres teachers, hell do? big take away article. results completely skewed numbering off. people right thing tested think they’re negative..... shame is, requires change power.

For God's sake-- comment section story antisemitic filth. Clearly typifies audience site quite well. ""advises"" So, nothing changes. can't believe Florida caps unemployment payments $275 week.

That's ridiculous. actually help anyone get look unemployment? Yeah. That's right. Entire bible belt way. Goofy FTW... Agreed possible. also realm possibility Trump decides pledge allegiance Russian joins new USSR publicly killing every democrat USA. going happen though. Boycott mask stores. Donuts essential. Theft justified case. Meanwhile, Finland ended homelessness. participants tested negative enter. r going get infected? randomly going put positive person without telling anyone test idea. specify article link. many kids died US due covid, maybe like &lt;10. I'm confused. Russian hackers? another Trump scheme buddying pal Putin? be. vaccine proven work, tested extensively people volunteering medical studies. agree.  Saying going impact numbers isnt really relevant someone still tested positive. Okay. Let's traumatize children letting go school watch teachers peers parents get sick. That's fine too?  Oh, Disney, whitewashing historical figures make palatable movies, trying hide raging Nazi Walt was, must open parks deplorables love because, well, fuck everything money got banned toxic sub refuting claim cloth masks work.

Most bay areans probably outdoorsy shit, fine. definitely casinos. CA government can't shit that. antibodies people Covid appear last couple months contrast measles antibodies last decades. fear get vaccine triggers antibody response protection last months. Also there’s question vaccine mean don’t get Covid-19 get little sick (not needing hospitalization)?  Everything new don’t know. since we’re rushing, won’t likely know vaccine deployed, people getting jab test subjects basically. Usually additional phase phase II studies help figure well side effects, needs skip (pregnant women? People certain conditions?) they’re skipping need rush. said, going zero-carbon... kinda stupid


That said, nothing face climate change *really* stupid. 


This matter requires nuanced reform. Vested interests however, remain main problem climate change 'debate'. 

Activists never expected provide 100% accurate policy proposals. role gain attention push hard vested interests. Unless put disclaimer front center, really helping Yes, two lines title.  NIH clinical trials depending located. E.g. recon_19 located near Bethesda, People bare hands tend touch less wash/sanitize more. know proper way remove dispose gloves, risk contaminating hands. countries allowed citizens collect 80% pay lock furloughs.

50% people benefits making working. 

Let’s real, I’d love see people recuperating lost. make working, people frontlines bit much, no? care people dying might affect you? get everyone hyped September shit bad. getting everyone's hopes bad too. gonna really difficult, shit still gonna around Christmas LOT businesses going fail means LOT people going unemployed. realistic means start planning shit-storm act pikachu-shocked November. can't find right now, one article listed ""expected death rate be"", math, 14,000 children! thinks ok?!? Youre probably right, I'm trying stay hopefully optimistic. enough kids die theres bound public uproar. describing culture. Everyone country it. Every country history. Blaming people shit back retarded cities signaling. bars restaurants never closed Japan. believe so? people able fight off, wouldn’t mean cells would memorize fight 2nd round better? 

Sort like vaccine. Oh dang started young. Forget days week planet song let's go straight flag!

That's creepy. Like pledge first thing took like min, scheduled time singing anthem etc.? Yikes done, true patriot.

Which goes Manning well IMO.  interested confirmed test total, rather projecting many actually disease. know lot infections never get tested, going strictly official cases would inaccurate Actually, covid related everything now. Go ahead, try. section asking quit due covid, answer yes start collecting. responsible stay home, wear mask limit contact anyone. Ride leadership fellow Americans get shit together. Can't football.

stay safe. wash hands, wear mask, limit exposure. cheers people Type ""conflicts interest"" search engine.

And issue study per se spin presented lay audience, Trump sat nearby. Seems like US government want bothered constant interference reality truth. Lets let go, podium, talking facts.

You know least amount cases covid-19 right? chart custom made proving it, cut countries lower us. lol Yeah someone sue. Contact lawyer. said truck later found abandoned 500 metres hijack scene back Siqwane Street NU 11.

So took samples. year guess would big news. 

I honestly know they'd worth much point pose much danger globally widespread

 
But look next part different company accidently dropped bunch samples back truck hahaha. Certainly interesting monkeys stealing samples month ago still. said NHLS shocked latest incident happened less month [after specimens found jogger dumped N2 outside East London 29 June.   courier company involved earlier incident admitted 80 samples fell bakkie's open canvas cover. re-used development original SARs virus, understand, swap protein spike COVID-19 whatever virus called. ""Check brain gate"" popular cast member expression worked 15 years ago, literally nothing surprises me. know shit bad Russia even consider this. 

Their military industrial complex is, next oil, remaining viable competitive industry, source leadership's wealth, viable foundation aggressive foreign policy, still retains paramount role minds political caste indoctrinated existential threat invasion. seems ill advised. surprises me. Didn’t Angela Merkel take EU leadership president?? It’s weird *she* would agree w/this. don’t worry going work year,

What people want work need money? Oh, seen US government? owner logic going give 100% fatality rate wait long enough Remember everyone upset guy shooting people Wal-Mart? “terrorist attacks shopping centers kills another 1,000 Texas 10 days” lot people would trying something it. Life coach agree that, think anything dystopian future (even near future) falls sci-fi, dystopian past (ie 1984) might not. Either way dystopian future fiction kryptonite yes get teased enjoying YA films like Maze Runner adult :D I've seen lot comments link archive.vn, similar. know works.  daily briefing mentioned along lines ”lots different reports around world, haven’t seen reinfections it’s atleast 6 months could longer”. sure Bloombergs based on.

But don’t think study behind it. Many friends strict quarantine beginning covid seem completely opened now. example, they’re posting pictures large groups hanging hugging enclosed spaces without masks. might be? source information says it’s safer March? No, that's simply lockdown &amp; social distancing taking effect How's ""wonderful experiment"" going? ""akin living laugh"" yet? ‘I tried goggle’.  

Hehehehe. prefer google. Hehehe. Good. pay ur lawyer file permanent residence like 200 countries top 10 cases per capita deaths per capita. ones ahead us either micro-nations European countries brought cases deaths almost nothing numbers going rise much more.

We pass many weeks.

Have fun laughing that. wish everyone could see way. general public awful employees, government awful employees....it's like attitude ""we need there, that's matters"". good months lol signed NDAs I'm pretty sure. Oof comment hit like truck wars

This better.... EVER DECENT? memories bit vague, remember singing first thing morning. think kindergarten songs also mixed bit throughout day, 1st 3rd dedicated time. 1. Covid-19 new, coronavirus’ general not. 

2. Thousands (not hundreds) years ago yes, would think world flat chased gazelles across Serengeti. However, thousands years passed many tens thousands experiments done proving earth is, FACT, flat. what’s point? truly don’t get it. evidence points masks working. Many different independent studies. find blind ignoring studies weird. Sure studies saying masks don’t work vast minority, follow science evidence points. Strange flex, man. 

3. wear mask, science says help community. I’m truly sorry you’re selfish think yourself. I’m sure it’s fun, truly pathetic little empathy world around you. Japan spiraling control quickly? fair compare utter disasters failures US Brazil, happening Japan? people wear masks public work places close quarters? Define free. find amusing find threat. guess message powerful. Hey, leave Twitter this. bots feel bad.  Mark words: last least day.
Prove wrong.  whole paradigm US operates forcing people go work broken can't figure do.  It’s also booked year advance cancel value shit. Asking maturity compliance mask rules Disneylanders, entitled people planet, even crazier asking maturity compliance school children states, teachers legally allowed strike. can't speak states, mine, break contract (which sign spring, things bad yet), sued teaching licenses revoked. imagine many stuck--we might choosing leave profession entirely work unsafe environment. top that, nearly impossible get workman's comp proving got school somewhere else extremely difficult. would help would community members advocating specifically safety since one bothering listen teachers' ideas, see advocating schools ""open"" general without understanding intricacies. fooling think in-seat schools able function effectively, especially us districts administrators believe Covid significant problem going back ""business usual"" want back way was. Oh yeah. Also, state, school sports can't go virtual. also driving decision making. fucking anti-vaxxer president, think would happen?  parties held responsible.

Except case business held responsible all. go character costume storage areas lights off, I've seen pictures internet gets creepy looking heads couple seconds, imagine creepy would real life.

But sludge? Must malfunction vacuum garbage system. play safe move 2024, paris 2028 LA 2032.

Time flies  Viruses existed this, corona virus nothing new terms virology. know size virus, hence know effectively block either inhaled exhaled. case, masks effectively blocks virus particles (be encased spit other) need focus on. like corona virus knows evade mask unlike virus. impacted many things pinpoint specific reason. episode Black Mirror sucks definitely need fight extensive labor reform. agree, entirely. data privacy reform.

Conclusions Relevance March early May 2020, persons 10 diverse geographic sites US infected SARS-CoV-2 virus. estimated number infections, however, much greater number reported cases sites. findings may reflect number persons mild illness seek medical care undergo testing still may contributed ongoing virus transmission population. that’s horrible, still good death rate gone much. first outbreak NYC 1,000 deaths day. expect cases keep going seems biggest states stabilized, least schools reopen. I’d like think we’re worst knows flu cold season coming I’m afraid get worse won’t know trump blocking CDC. Even I’m glad aren’t 2,500 deaths day half cases still. California originally state wide order rural counties threw fit didn’t cases punished. told public going defy state orders come enjoy indoor dining. compromise state switched county county orders. Within weeks rural counties started Covid cases. people saying county county punishing rural counties exactly wanted. People going complain either way seems.  same, common usual potentially severe usual — longer-lasting, intense pain higher, longer-duration fevers. swear people spout ""freedom"" ""choice"" defense act wear masks pandemic ones strangely confuse precautionary measures fear, fear weakness. People like dangerous kind mindset. downwards spiral them. Instead participating unity overcome, fight win lose. ""Go store without mask, choice decision you.

I sent PM research. mentioned nursery homes, military bases, prisons States nothing stop outbreak; people traveling counties states different place enjoy lockdown house exposing different place; wearing masks became politicized; re-openings quick. Even gave five footnotes. obviously put lot time research opinion. holds lot weight. still see logical explanation. industrialized nations nursing homes, prisons, military installations. may differ one country next things listed specific States. mass travel could explain increase infection increased death rate.

Phase 3 run said would results Mid-June.

They also said would start Phase 3 US. stalling.


It probably failed.  settlement government, company admitted 14 felonies related fraudulent billing practices. happened Scott’s leadership called cops someone spit car? smoking pubes, heard gets high “If don’t receive meeting invite, directly impacted change,” Roslansky said 

Pity invited.

I notice LinkedIn longer opening pages non-members. boost, I'm sure, internet privacy. /r/dontdeadopeninside actually isnt true. zero studies say that. studies antibodies stay body period time isnt immunity works.

Definitely fair. believe testing twice they’re even allowed practice, basically relying players self-report exposure/ follow masks social distancing rules. Personally, huge NFL fan, I’m disappointed haven’t thought complete plan play considering they’ve 4 months so. I’m expecting worst hoping best. “Meta-science” isn’t quackery (that’s “metaphysics”). meta-scientist someone specializes study scientific methodology.

Now, probably necessary ever considering wide range spread throughout country. However, feasible. even greed anymore. simply can't afford it. I’ve wondering hard must deaf people. great solution. Yah get LOL unless you’re ready deal someone go it. knowledge. anything back up? knowledge herd immunity goal short while, quickly abondened officials. admire kindness, needs understand money wealth give away money like that.

Dude need put boundaries companies. Idk how, I'm make ppl think. hope they're suing Especially nurses, work ridiculous hours. Many late days suspended well, working every day. I'd fatigued too. I’m going hell laughing 😂 300k detected cases. Serosurveys point towards 15-20% infected London alone. 


80% nonsense. Virus burns closer 15-20%. 


You doomers getting insane week two away claiming virus gained sentience close getting nuclear codes. Disney past point shame. passed point looooong time ago. mean, long attach deadline, cases definitely trend downward. burn everyone eventually, point way down. Mine don't, sit home answer emails day long grade papers, guess I'm different school yoy sounds like they’re exact opposite hate them. 

You said phase 3 started April. Well actually phase 1. 

You said aren’t releasing results phase 3. phase 3 yet. 

You said results efficacy expected mid June. actual experts said “hoped”. 

We got initial reports phase 1 not? 

By sources I’m finding looks like 1 month. homes set temporary morgues. Crematoriums running overtime. Families must wait week bury loved ones. body couriers funeral workers, there’s letup sight.

We saw New York, learned nothing it. Yeah considering *new* concept mRNA vaccines are, I'm rather curious production go. know unique advantage make prototype extremely fast, well production works. I'm told producing mRNA vaccine faster, too, suspect requires pharmaceutical plant right biomachinery producing class mRNA vaccine first place. class pharmaceutical machinery probably widely available yet. Maybe get successful mRNA vaccines hedge mutations like covid-29. Isn’t medicine already active since 1965 primarily helpful things like “dry cough”?

I see even order country. NYC entered phase 4 excellent. know face gets unpleasantly sweaty mask wear outside. Temperatures around 30 summer, it’s often uncomfortably humid. don’t know humidity Russia compares. used live somewhere would get 40 dry heat. less unpleasant, though never wore mask there.  Yep don’t dead don’t feel like front line worker, America decided give middle finger front line workers. 

Stay remember worked harder longer toughest times. 

I know it’s hard, proud yourself. Let instill confidence certainly earned it. call cops ban man returning.
It hard hurting getting rid bad apples.  cases can't go test anyone Wish could. longer option anyway Europe banned Americans traveling there. :( no, say that. know over. let's say doubles triples vaccine readily available. still seem bad percentage-wise. That's I'm saying. viral pandemic spitting spread said virus, it’s considered terroristic threat, death results due virus, it’s murder. think reason believe this, although believe vaccine early 2021. Questions availability efficacy. really unironically say ''Facts don’t care feelings. Sorry owned hard''? citing accepted figure. blood tests, may see increase accuracy. portion false negatives nasal swabs may altogether miss anyone infected exclusively via eyes fecal oral route, blood tests may help there. Kids cruel. going wear masks social distance. Bullies run kids purposely cough them. backfire, especially middle school level. Yeah, Meck Wake Durham, descending order cases deaths. Well, going Johns Hopkins site. know what's reliable anymore ... Raw lsst night fpr unknown reasons. Perhaps NYC also little dips going back too. Maybe start quickly drop overall still bad. 100k outstanding tests, it’s huge backlog get Trump come briefing wearing masks whole time w/o disparaging it, I'll take win country. It’s amazing State Department wants us care point. Probably research kept secret... I'm defending, things could go quickly research open, like software open source. One country could discover something effective something countries discover... Nail head.

Everyone criticizes businesses recklessly reopening forgetting government piss poor job keeping afloat. guarantee business owners knew expenses covered (and maybe little extra government financial assistance pocket), wouldn’t many stories like this. Unfortunately, almost certainly right. problem general public needs like New Yorkers filmed grocery giving Karen shit wearing mask.


Sure people would rather mind business. health us, families, friends, neighbors. thought boycotting Chinese products? Ironically read article minute ago. They're going take penny military. never never will. military sacred production bumps Texas Florida, Lockheed Martin said doesn’t expect pandemic material impact finances year. company raised 2020 sales profit guidance Tuesday reporting forecast-beating quarterly Pentagon pledged cover contractors’ additional costs continuing work pandemic, seeking $10 billion funding yet authorized Congress. Pentagon’s accelerated payments helped push cash supply chain keep component makers afloat pandemic. Lockheed Martin also continued hire staff. facing reality watch videos still anti mask.

The reality need face people die. pandemic postponed contained possible.

It tragic emotional messaging convince well anymore since already three months mess. really honest would interested arguments actually convinced me.

I mean apart ""you kill people"". ""just two weeks"". ""we soon go back normal"".


Pragmatic would go? Really interested emotional plea moral shaming. 

What long term plan?

Because virus control long term thing. also normal still fined party.

How going end brutal path herd immunity?


Also watch slaughter videos feel important know meat came from. lot people avert gaze horrible stuff.

You angry never hear anything pragmatic except hoping vaccination. (That probably protect fully).

I find horrible consider socially distanced world worse thing. certain countries still keen herd immunity? Bad troll bad. There's nothing wrong opinion. 

What's wrong blatant hypocrisy implies lack sincerity behind outrage. upset 2 Ebola deaths, upset 142k deaths. upset Obama's excessive golfing, furious Trump. unhappy increasing deficit Obama, outrage huge deficit Trump? could go on. 

People live entirely within echo chamber seek confirmation bias sheeple, exist left right. Personally stick neutral media sources (AP, Reuters, NPR) get news, form opinions subjects. regard high skepticism site tells \*\*how\*\* feel news I'm reading, seek opposing views grapple cognitive dissonance make sure aware facts skewed directions sides.

After that, I'm still horrified 142k deaths, many could avoided better leadership. California twice many people. Never mind. point lost. See better: “called out” arrogant morons assumed didn’t know University Oxford located. 
This comedy, reality that, regardless vaccine developed, cost US anywhere else planet people allowed die cannot afford cost. uninsured walking away hospitals lifetimes debt (hundreds thousands dollars). Many staying away treatment late simply convinced families financially ruined seek treatment (and likely would be). People US face reality every day COVID-19. decide buying food paying rent paying medical care medications. So, don’t insult intelligence “why attitude” “you better this”. attitude comes watching people needlessly contract virus die.
Be better.
Note: last response thread intended assume know better, you. I'm convinced got scabies gym. 

This years ago, was't sexually active anyone, share bathrooms soap, towels etc. went school, went home gym. place touched human fluids using gym equipment wiped properly. America become super spreader re-spread virus rampantly throughout unaffected parts world. 

Why still allowing Americans leave country? Right now, US military personnel seem able fly military bases country without going procedures regular American passport holders.

Isn't responsible thing United States shut rest world? this? Bro, know Im NY lol. American work ethic, give pretend happen. That’s cool all... awesome experiences don’t pay bills help save invest retirement. saying Disney kind benefits. get point. everyone wear mask indoors social distance everywhere. Ban indoor gatherings. Slowly get back near-normal transmission longer exponential. 

Most people things. virus still spread. realistic expect 100% compliance. ~20% people believe Bigfoot earth flat. going dumdums everywhere.

We still learn deal it. thing isn’t going away soon can’t stay locked indefinitely. People going accept life comes risk know, like almost every OECD country already (besides vaccine part). EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, etc.

Many European countries similar rates mask usage US comparable death rates. *Ted Cruz entered chat* Depending efficacy vaccine, 18% could make break it.  sisters Boyfriend (who lives house) started showing Covid symptoms like 18 days ago continued week completely back normal sister started showing symptoms 11 days ago 4 days symptoms, need continue quarantine symptoms? so, long? Let idiots throw fit. give loud voices science says otherwise. ends end July unlikely extended. 

So isn’t really true. 

Those people get nothing without lockdown. People delusion either die recover back ""normal"". growing evidence case even ""recovered"" people suffering long-term chronic conditions. think need start reporting anti-mask comments “self-harm” Facebook.

I got idea reported someone self harm said used bleach water clean vegetables... comments like shouldn’t exist could influence idiot (that idiot could young kid...) Awww reunion sex... Worldwide? Whichever one produced fastest w/o costing much. early tell one become ""worldwide standard"". We'd need know ones work, too.

However, given large contracts produce, one would spread worldwide might Oxford one. largest production publicly known. *Time* worldwide? Depends greedy G20 are. I'd say every country's best interest immunize entire world fast possible, mutation meaningful enough new immune response. wrong. saved take son either Disney cruise Disney land year, first time I've ever able afford it, I'm working right school free time go. 

Been looking forward decade. proud finally money opportunity really give son amazing experience never got kid, fire nation attacked.... well covid anyway. 


I'd love throw caution wind take anyway, 9 tomorrow, make wear mask gloves everywhere little kid touch everything matter many times tell to. hope keep money banked up, wait till next year, anything could happen now.

 1500 put away two ps5s well, hoping get two day 1, I'd say I'll waiting month two find them. sure much theyll be, I'm hoping 1500 covers 2 accessories them. Ps4 controllers work backups too.  Well twice size. probably accurate amount cases. New York getting slammed looking enough testing. Free 7 day trial anyone genuinely interested. free full membership/access Considering ride uphill climb, it’s difficult say long is. true generic drugs. Wtf since when? public know this? 

AN INTERNSHIP PAYS $20/H!?!? work there?

The person knew ""paid"" internship freaken Google like ""yeah makes sense"" think got free lodging possibly food I'm sure. based theory people naturally immune infection, studies suggest could anywhere 40 60 percent. tests (for resistant t-cells) small sample sizes. gives pause fact we're seeing 60 percent infection rates prisons, ships, neighborhoods on. Maybe someone expertise chime in. can’t possibly enforce this? Trump turned mask political agenda. ban eating drinking walking, like Disneyworld? Meck already pretty bad? can't remember Meck Wake 'winning'. Well, go look. people still getting sick? feel sympathy people, do. grandmother, given age, absolutely do. still selfish things benefit you, others damned. Mass riots follow well. we're run people comprehend quarter's profit shows Illinois State Health Dept tracks reports data daily trump Federal govt say Smells way smaller particles virus droplets. Like WAY WAY smaller. might contact management let know. may prefer already known steady renter cost repair prep unknown renter.  think spelled ""pervert"" wrong. Interesting. Canada still file regardless. would bet telling teens “hunker down” socialize successful abstinence sex education. US tap pay would less peanut butter covered buttons push too. know screwing fucking data. yeah bet right. It’s considered act terrorism, crime, spit someone pandemic. back lie, stock barely moved since announced drug worked... Definitely priced already Wikipedia page lol I'm tired hearing ""but choice have"" first world countries already shown us Right. 

But none happening highly unlikely happen. 

It’s almost insane pretend happening operate though fantasy real. 

The reality state locks end month telling citizens income time. 

That reality. 

So demand states lockdown, you’re demanding high percentage citizens lose everything. Yeah, fkn crazy new evidence emerges surrounding novel virus people change recommendations based new data. Science weird, bro. non filtered masks keep getting infected.

Fuck, make homemade mask par n95 use multiple layers right materiaks.

Using virtually type mask, amount youll get infected miniscule youll asomptomatic.  Isn’t everybody right now? executives safe behind computer aren’t exactly busting butt protect frontline associates, measure place customers perception far less deaths! must something right? want money. government willing help, stay afloat. 50% horizon budget spent bureaucracy anyways. could reduce controlling costs solve reduced funding way :P “For every single dollar spend Disney theme park, you’re getting something worth $0.10 back.” 

You mean tell things made cheaply sold profit? 😱 news flash, that’s Disney thing

Your statement like sponge, doesn’t hold water. could point holes, don’t time right now. I’m Disney completely sucks, say essentially comes anti-capitalism. Although it’s artificial hell, it’s similar nature is. Somebody gotta lose. That’s cosmetic dlc get behind. Wait, think over? think everybody going get COVID already gotten it?

What stupid take. 

It's like car speeding towards cliff, say ""I see big problem, fallen cliff yet"". Trump happened. I'm tempted, we'll see things go. Others much good place me. moved room cut lot expenses allowed save bit. government cutting unemployment check $600 boosted realized ppl can't live 1,200 month. least area, I'd $500 rent get I'd save 2 checks change rent. Remember, live room, studio would leave $100 left paying rent. top checks delayed try detect fraud, people can't wait long little. They're forcing hands. can't shirt also say something, like understand you, please write message?

Like us something simple convey this. know sign encountered someone hear read lips mind writing messages understand other. know time consuming but... another way communicate right? Real quick, unpaid internships illegal US unless actually work internship.

All big companies pay interns, pay well.

Last intern package saw employer like $20 hour plus free rent 2 month internship (for non locals) That's exactly correct. defunding two organizations, adding additional funding round. also wrong, IMO. . . Store ban second offense convincing counter-statement. 

There many grocery stores, even large city. vague embarrassing letting know facetious attack? people, there's lockdown, stay home get assistance (unemployment pandemic assistance). 

Without lockdown, choose going work dangerous environment becoming homeless (which ALSO dangerous environment, btw). tests took days come back then

I bad news. tests still take days come back. definitely true. Met person brought back virus antibody without ever getting sick show kind symptoms accidentally spread whole family hospitalized. Reality nice sound it. trashy reality show connotation, would sound nice Justice, Diamond, Nevaeh, unusual name. combination ""Winner"" hard take seriously. Proof always find someone somewhere make bullshit every job? :) Thoretical couldn’t even get stimulus properly! I’m still waiting mine, I’m hearing don’t get year, you’ll get taxes next year. I’m hoping won’t still pandemic tax season next year, help then? I, along 30-35 million others, need stimulus NOW. needed back everyone else getting it. need help pay rent don’t get evicted moratorium over, need put food table. Yes, need stimulus checks. also need get money everyone actually qualify like 30-35 million us gotten whoopsie daisy sorry u gotta wait next year uwu forgive us gotta give biwwions biggest companies u dont neeeeeed anything find somethwing NEW!!!!! Get sick working high risk minimum wage job u deserve help!!! That’s basically I’m hearing government.


Sorry, ranted. yeah. Frustrating.  helpful. Even believed data trustworthy. I'm ignorant matter someone explain would appreciate - collaborations vaccine developments actually competition based ""I'll develop vaccine do?"" X organization? That's Trump half-assing new backtracking effort he's losing badly. people inept effectively combat virus. They've already proven that. ego large put real experts charge, even would better politically.  [Bro totally scam look shutup!! filthy anti freedomer!!! x( Family Dollar Dollar General stores common small midwest towns small support Walmart. customer base probably especially anti-mask. penalty corporate failure

This true. high school classmates’ father CEO like 5-6 different companies 7 years. keeps running ground getting nice severance packages, finding new job somewhere else. It’s bewildering Also nail head.

And know fact Texas didn’t even attempt set contact tracing system. Even cases low. I’m sure weren’t ones. Guess I'm going america while...  Well, honest, anybody dead they're going come handy.  guess public realizing little hospital administration governments care healthcare workers. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* like specificity, friend. Ok - stay locked another year getting mad online, one stop you. Yeah millions people watched them, reason wants again. views millions Americans desperate information guidance pandemic ravaging country captive audience get get good screen time. bad he'll probably cause harm good. Ibuprofen fine unless actual research showing otherwise?

And do, please tell people take naproxen aspirin... type drug ibuprofen. USA Brazil Russia, 3 countries cases common? leaders arrogant morons ignored problem. corners supposedly cutting?

""side effects"" things like sore arm, headache day low-grade fever. prefer world-paralyzing pandemic feeling weather day? sheets, towels, comforters, look clean, re-used multiple guests. Pre-covid. 

I'd hate think what's happening rooms now. [Read asymptomatic people found lung damage. feel fine, never display traditional symptoms like coughing, never feel need get tested, end hospital something unrelated like appendix lo behold tests reveal they’re Covid-positive typical Covid lung damage despite blissfully unaware. Seems like wishful thinking me.
I doubt scientific proof all, theories.

I'm betting life stem/shaft? small samples error propagation becomes big. That's range got measures took time, think would called 50x times realistic scenario. Sucks them!

&lt;Glances ""Trump 2020"" yard sign neighbor's lawn remembers live southern United it! old lady job isn’t control store policy. hope lock guy long time deter dumb people short temper. right... unless course take account: 
- Merkels statement actions driven government act faster climate change

- gotten students take interest environment, forcing governments worldwide take account bigger interest environmental policies

- made possible climate issues played significant role European Parliament election may 2019 ( got Juncker say: ""In next financial period 2021 2027, every fourth euro spent within EU budget go towards action mitigate climate change"")

- Thanks ubiquity media helped 'green' parties world, especially europe gain seats ""Green parties recorded best ever result,[118] boosting MEP seat numbers 52 72.[119] Many gains came northern European countries young people taken streets inspired Thunberg""

- again, helped younger people (as well older people) take interest environment: August 2019, publication sales children's books climate crisis reportedly doubled compared previous year. Publishers attribute ""Greta effect"".[121] 

- this: Inspired Thunberg, wealthy philanthropists investors United States donated $600,000[122] support Extinction Rebellion school strike groups establish Climate Emergency Fund.[123][124][125] Trevor Neilson, one philanthropists, said three founders would contacting friends among global mega-rich donate ""a hundred times"" weeks months ahead.[122] December 2019, New Scientist described impact made Thunberg Extinction Rebellion headline: ""The year world woke climate change"".[126]""

- spearheaded anti-flying movement, led ""Sweden reported 4% drop domestic air travel 2019 increase rail use.

So either havent read article youre plain ignorant. money both. also know Greta Thunberg become widely popular school curricula, least Germany. leads higher awareness environment, leads parties needing address issue.

So lot changed. Lots accomplishments. enough changed, right. Maybe join trying shut factories such? Instead bioterrorism, maybe someone trying destroy evidence Well put. Yup... people stockpiling guns ammo reason saying it? 

Answer: jack fuckin shit shit, we'd stayed thoroughly locked maybe another month, spent time getting proper contact tracing place we'd good position open operate fairly normally now. Great! means people take matters hands beat living hell idiots refuse wear masks! Eventually people ""journalists"" whatever newly created Trump sucking startup agency is... Fox ""liberal"" him. doctor straight told don’t need tested completely loss sense smell taste. Basically chances something COVID causing loss astronomical. Especially since exposed someone test positive. stopped saying pledge allegiance shortly high school, teachers would get trouble didn’t stand it. Detention fun stuff. threatening freedom way continue indoctrinate children (Being held hours room aren’t allowed anything, including school work, like mock jail kid). I’d argue majority equities bonds owned, percentage-wise, minority top. 

Most people middle, largest asset house, lesser extent retirement accounts. UBI robust unemployment would allow middle class people keep homes. 

On flip side, top control financial assets would much larger impact. aren’t making money. experiment see many guests employees die. U.S went 2 million new cases 3 million 28 days.

It took 14-15 days go 3 million 4 million new cases.

That's exponential growth, folks. I'm pretty sure sent threat mother. school even getting trouble homework. issues that, make good headline. Yea fever joint pain day, I’ll take Covid complications thanks edgy kid stand repeat pledge high school boy people hate that. Every full time worked gets benefits, people see parks Cali full time. seriously going leave going country like far concerned liquidity debts (like student loans), keep paying them? Although I’d rather known nothing. less people know exist, better excuses, preventable. Even covid hell NYC sero survey showed 20% residents tested antibodies.

That back April. confirmed cases doubled since sero survey. studies coming showing people may immune without showing antibodies (T B cells something). good side effects? Yes let’s create plague hotels Disney’s zombie employees great idea. You’re lowering brain cell count

Goodbye ha Okay hard disagree points. people suck, good judge? amazonians probably disagree lifestyle disagree theirs. makes better? Cause grew society ability gun 'lessers' like them? That's called colonial imperialism we've tried species end well... 10th time new species elephant snakes, technicality. Iowa City mayor nothing proud of. late party. I'll first line get widely available. stores purposely understaffed insecure. one risk exposing analogy doesn’t really make sense. Catching murderer committed murder different altering life avoid chance murder?

People don’t avoid leaving house fear murdered like said, odds murdered effectively zero.

I still think shouldn’t opening schools though since children would pass virus teachers, staff, family members would effectively zero death rate. knowledge there's widespread available testing, that's way beyond me. I'm regurgitating I've read. Even 1 10 clear. 10% hospitalized? (Which actually many.) 1 10 cases (which lot huge public health problem). Canadian, we’ll travelling east west coast homeland it’s safe so, hopefully next year. 

and hitchbot reminder made even madder lmao “Pro-life” Source? downloaded episode American Life awhile back kept waiting hear FBI interested reality show. None countries allies fear. however like US could obliterate anyone fucked them, even someone different fucked simultaneously. there’s whole single-country-that-makes-up-quarter-of-world-economy thing. I’d agree say 100 200 years ago. chasm rich poor combined top control information means window holding people accountable getting smaller everyday. reason aren’t already dead AI isn’t good enough yet wait restaurants. Every employee matter past decade getting 4 extra day passes per year MINIMUM holidays, summer winter mainly.

But you’re wrong 6 days, actually 15 days idea lying making things up. It’s 15 days multiplied 4 people 60 times base entrance pass without extras, that’s 60 entrances ANYWHERE WORLD. means 60 multiplied pass prices, $200 DL + CA $12000. 

Why everyone acting like know things don’t?

There blackout days 300 days year open, yeah it’s issue especially since blackouts change get anytime free.

Anything else want prove wrong?  ""I know diseases better anybody, I've one whole life."" Ill bet blast parties. Lots friends. Yep. MS slipping radar due low population, today's record 1600 new cases equivalent 16,000 (!!) cases Texas. Plus MS one states highest obesity lowest quality health care. 

Hospitalizations still rising, means deaths gonna keep rising further. cases still rising, means hospitalizations gonna keep rising.

Not looking good. New York, Cali, Florida Texas four corona giants. That’s comforting. like that. 165 days don’t think much more.

Six 24 times infections estimated per site** seroprevalence coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case report data. literally first paragraph lol Ah thank pointing out. There’s justifiable reason drunk driving given risks, absolutely justification “widely socializing”: humans social creatures need interaction survive, let alone thrive. that’s two examples different. assume risk/reward equal, aren’t. Drunk driving = high risk, low reward. Seeing people = low risk, high reward vaguely remember that. third 2020 sixth? much dumb shit happens daily can't keep track time anymore Trump full it, without BEANS! fucking love see give lecture university topic claims expert small taste certain person hopes achieve henchmen sent cities across country. 1st amendment, freedom expression.

Yea wrong I’m sure start. released phase 1/2 results YESTERDAY. would phase 3 failed (which obviously soon kind results for)? administered two doses participants phase 1/2 (per last comment), new strategy, would something would warrant starting trials again.


If want hear bad news go somewhere else you’re getting good news oxford vaccine right now. Good point, medical professionals could basically call shot. Nope cause already sign away fact could get injured. Covid another liability sheet favorite easily offended immediately call us snowflakes.  best way I've seen described calling US ""Undeveloping nation"". Yeah heck about? Trucks even more.

If I'm honest find funny 90% ppl actually follow rules flag. Yup appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* bias.

Yes, fact seeing bias troubling considering claimed education study presented hyped, unorthodox manner spin-prone politician seated nearby.

The data released soon knew p-value analysis complete. 3k Americans dying day country unprecedented stay home orders want talk unorthodox. again, attacking fact someone nearby, 100% fallacy insistence stick really making ask there's good faith you, troll, learning impaired study released without data review.

Do understand Emergency Use Authorization is? argument would maybe hold water Fauci came said TV accurate. accurate, data released. point dead water sticking best bad study used immediately start production drug produced company lobbyist White House.

Jesus. many times need told Ad Hominem that, fucking fallacy, study contradicted another study released day.

Stop using blown study proof anything. bad argument makes look stupid.

If accept science, I'll use quote here:

""Thanks contributing anti-literacy movement!""

Go crawl back whatever hole came luddite. fact many upvotes hilarious indicative batshit sub times. Remdesivir saving lives every day.  acknowledge women working outside home equal opportunities time

Right, one easily look labor statistics see number women workforce abhorrent. Maybe misunderstood original position described Housewives luxury rather role women faced face many barriers getting workforce. DEFINITELY need deny actual facts make point.

What fact denied? said ""women start entering workforce large numbers World War two"" true. see percentages women workforce pre-World War II postwar World War II significantly larger still low percentage. think wrong factually incorrect point women working outside home reality vast majority American women.  used work restaurant; yes, service quality took steep decline “capacity” reached open closed sections excess seating. 

Health care workers human. can’t imagine would different. gals worked 30 years, equally stressed us done 10.

I’d say illustrate people “remember got shit service restaurant busy” I’m sure they’ll respond: that’s never happened(probably live small town anything corner bar) doctors nurses different!(Yes. Medicine food . metaphor checks many ways) April US CFR something like 7-10%, pretty much line missing 90% actual infections true IFR around 1%. thinking going with. Much better wear real mask get infected. isn’t every bandaid, maxi pad, used Kleenex also medical waste? [Are possible coronavirus vaccine proven effective end year, however, widely available. (Translation Google. Let know spot faults I'll correct them!) 

**Despite reports overcrowded outdoor cafes, congestion beaches fact holiday elsewhere, curve showing number infected people Sweden drops drastically. What depend on?**

According state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, combination causes causing spread infection decrease sharply right now. He believes images congestion exceptional, Sweden still good keeping distance.

\- free moved think many businesses good making sure possible keep distance, people it. Then certainly exceptions, always do, pictures reflect total reality, says Anders Tegnell.

##No herd immunity

Another reason warmer weather least partially affects virus, fact outdoors makes difficult virus spread.

The fact infection decreased dramatically also due fact parts population Sweden achieved immunity, means expected ""push"", come meet others usually do, materialized.

\- herd immunity, may achieve either. It rare diseases disappear way. But level matters. The large, rapid decline seeing strongly suggests high level immunity.

##Tegnell: ""Swedish strategy works""

The total sum epidemic slowed way Anders Tegnell could believe weeks ago.

\- course happy, easier healthcare fewer deaths. It feels good here. It also actually another sign Swedish strategy actually works, says Anders Tegnell.

##The process countries completely closed

To date, 5,646 people reported dead covid-19 Sweden. And Sweden received lot criticism outside world shutting society completely.

Instead, strategy recommend residents stay away voluntary basis, wash hands socialize much. Many countries banned people moving freely fine go outdoors without valid reason, wear face mask.

\- rapid course, rapid declining spread infection, many countries said shut society. We succeeded much less invasive measures Sweden, says Tegnell. I'm down, already practically beginning revolution. Let's rebuild! know China done phase II testing moving phase III, right? Someone told mom bad Christian telling people wear masks protect communities God wants people die regardless prevention care. ridiculous. Also, flag house yard really weird. Seatbelts required worn either. I'm talking applies people inside outside, big part heavily applies US citizens countries radar outside news headlines. Many US really interact cultures beyond US limited foreign media plays reinforcing mentalities ""we best"" real options depending metric using.

Imagine basing views mask usage see shitty meme subreddits opposed actual scientific study.

Reddit mistake. That’s probably idea lol. Would explain lower death rate, I’d imagine death toll would still massive even average younger population. 22% would around 6 million people. SARS vaccine story much complicated. here's interesting paper it. biggest problems cited SARS vaccine development coronaviruses elicit long term immune response.

Guys what, people outside sweden totally allowed opinions sweden

&amp;#x200B;

Source: Danish. lot opinions sweden point, even greatest country nation. either get lot worse, back control. Since beginning June things upswing, perhaps large part out-of-state testing turnaround time multiple weeks making essentially useless. 

The last weeks seen in-state testing grow substantially, giving us even cases positivity dropping.

The next week critical. Jeff Bezos man leaked dick pic kompromat response Saudi Arabia trying bribe censoring Washington Post. think he's influenceable.

And mine &lt;3 thank wishes Isn’t great UPS knocks door need signature, guy isn’t wearing mask?

Indoors. building signs everywhere saying must wear mask.

I’ve sent complaint customer service. Mickey cares money shareholders. Everyone else replaceable. ""leadership"" high shit, well administration's cult-like base. us. Well.... fair *really* going coronavirus.   Yep spitting beyond nasty! would automatic ass beating kid. find shocking roughly 50% Americans want receive Coronavirus vaccine right now. true. hate admit this, look around fellow countrymen, often feel actual disgust. Rest Peace :( supposed sarcasm guess obvious enough. Interesting note median age India (not sure Delhi specifically maybe someone else weigh in) around 29 compared 38 US 43 EU. absolutely celebrating fact rapid increase number cases around country seem resulting corollary increase deaths.

Treatment improved, yes that's something celebrate. 

But celebrating uncontained spread virus. course mortality going lower larger numbers young people making lot tests. *should* concerned matter time community spread hitting ridiculous levels like 15% I~~F~~R cities.

E: Gonna add NY lowest # hospitalizations since March 18 recently. it, too. virus need spread. multiplier applies looking backwards would apply moving forward.

So it’s 75000 cases day, could 750,000 cases day. cuts things down.

I advocating herd - crazy number deaths, hospitalizations, folks permanent issues.

But think current pace puts US track partial herd January-March timeframe, coupled vaccine administration change, end nightmare early next year. Maybe this? 🤷‍♀️

KCDC director-general, Jeong Eun-kyeong, stated would investigating determine results issue testing, quoted saying thought due ""reactivation"" virus, rather saying could potentially ongoing health issues would need lifetime care? 


Sounds like health insurance corps could really get behind this. understand, getting virus sort like waging war body come top, body still ravaged conflict. Getting vaccine, like playing nerf gun war win, body much able recover much less enormously impacted. 

In short, vaccines typically produce much stronger antibody response body would naturally fighting virus.  friends quite characters, ones 5'8"" tall. :)  Poki too, 75% sure contracted recently due people refusing wear masks businesses anything protecting workers. works absolutely could work home, company refused let so, team 10, one 3 people left office. Everyone else quarantine home. supervisor's direct boss sick, chose work home anyway, let anyone else explain can, one else allowed unless actively sick. Things going get really bad here. :( Sucks personally everything supposed someone else's actions / inaction protect others causes get ill. I've wearing mask isolating since March...this worst nightmare. year without sports going go bad normal people. handle others idk tell government knows pretty exact measurement phone alone, personal advice try get rid sister law   one knows medicine me. one.

Also, say ""we can't stop ICUs overflowing,"" said can't stop virus. opinion basic distancing smart behavior, can't stop virus, keep hospitals good shape.

Yes, ""Europe."" assume mean Belgium, Italy, Spain, UK France, experienced worse deaths/mm USA (and reason we're close Northeast USA).

Yes, pandemic over, say, south/midwest still time put us top. We'll see, suppose. see reason extreme alarm point, especially state CA, LA County specifically. Also: cAsTlE gOt PaInTeD!@! *salutes* General Lee. Understandable. Even though supposed use exact titled sub, often add state parentheses it’s obvious - forgot this.  Flint, MI, top lead problem people started dying ""pneumonia"". (Saw story Frontline) Investigators go death record one one finally figured actually Legionairres disease.

Florida eating crow right they're pretending chicken. biggest expenditure could recoup money healthcare expenses. health care system broke, we're spending twice much everyone else getting worse care.

If could get healthcare line with, say, Germany, we'd much better healthcare services saving around ~$1.8 TRILLION dollars year public private spending ($10,600/capita vs $5100/capita).

The point averaging cases per day, approximately long take reach herd immunity. 200k cases per day would take 2 years. Yes grow exponential. you’d also assume reach something like 1 million new cases day there’d shutdowns etc would drag things out. don’t see full caution wind lets get exponential growth maxed 5 million infections next week 10 million week etc. hospital system would collapse. limits sustainable level spread. 


But none relevant. relevant claiming there’s 1.3 million cases day. 100k. utter bullshit.  doesn‘t prove anything. think might redefine means ‚infected‘. yeah mucosa gets overloaded millions viruses again, obviously take time immune system ramp defenses. might feel little swelling such.

So - reality - theory drug help really solid still needed prove - hence funding.

They'll legislate sue get brain. lose pockets oh deep. Fine.

This site, constantly revising estimates upward they're way conservative, Florida deaths almost 20k November 1st, still going fairly conservative estimate 4x deaths 3 months end sight. I’m tracking, - however must understand even 100% side effect(s) seen, doesn’t mean drug fall outside FDA’s necessary safety parameters. Phase 1 almost entirely evaluate safety, clearly tolerable enough even high doses (250mig, irrc), continue. study low sample indicate high rate symptoms expected - may also caused GV approach Moderna using. believe also going test breaking administration cycle two doses.

I believe Oxford-AstraZeneca’s vaccine first gain FDA clearance, however use VV approach. could potentially prove lack efficacy we’d like assume GV like Moderna’s packs heavy punch leaves protected. knows. data per Lancet, shows recent data showing 60% chance side effects, like Moderna’s, mild/moderate, required hospitalizations like Moderna’s, iirc. pause one OX/AZ’s studies including placebo group. could skew initial perception safety related efficacy. Though also less faith US government agency right - fully support U.K. ensuring vaccine develop manufactured domestically. 

Due this, see OX/AZ’s vaccine getting market first - don’t see Moderna’s vaccine wouldn’t continue productive, would interesting see two interact one another assuming approved. would likely take years, realistically - may need long time cover bases virus mutates continues spread. 

The OX/AZ vaccine aims prevent catching virus - assuming available early 2021 possibly 2020 OX-AZ, prevention virus coupled prevention virus leading disease seems like one-two punch. 

They incredibly promising, don’t know much efficacy yet although Moderna entering phase 3 trial - former trials are/will continue go gather data. mixed phase/fast-tracked candidate currently pipeline. 

Basically, wouldn’t slam one promising published vaccine candidates - far much discovered, wouldn’t surprised several candidates fall apart phase 3. many variables, need pragmatically take published data in, view results, hope best. Preliminarily, seems ChAdOx1. 

I high hopes candidates, long fall within tolerable safety parameters effective - fewer losers pharma-market multiple choices vaccinate. mighty military 100s military prevent Crimea Syria? what's point? say lightly, maybe worst-modded large sub I've ever seen. year?  population fatality rate Neshoba county MS high NYC, .28%.

Shocking!

I wonder mask wearing corresponds hoarding. incorrect. world sit around wait us anymore. internet invented 30 years ago. ruined America 20 years ago..

We could step tech arena point innovation stall.  False positives misreporting test numbers things. OP links article describes issue accuracy tests article Florida misreporting actual numbers. two different things. 0.2% margin error actually really good. Fauci's boss looks like Fauci mustache, first glance. whole world turn DT constituency, including among constituency caught it, say ""Hah! foolin' along! even got wear mask!"" America able listen Donald's gut feeling based vast medical epidemiological knowledge. Protip aspiring new species there: great flavor good thing invest genetic skill tree. [Some MS require face mask public, Neshoba Holmes among them, sadly. Thank much comment. really means lot :)

Also, wife made popcorn microwave, tell actually smell it. dude, good building pyramids. probably saw even supporters abandoning him/ dying anti-mask protesters. TMC ""projection"" great: days growth, therefore project perfectly linear *decrease* next 14 days. think right. look day day numbers test counts actually decrease. example today saw net decrease 661 tests tests performed 22+ days ago. plausible explanation would people retested recently oldest test got purged count. South Africa month winter daily new cases rose 19 fold last two months. UK get new cases 400 day won’t exceed time daily high 19 fold increase. even come close top new case curve. Expect deaths keep increasing another 30 days. number free ICU beds anywhere?

And thanks. That's good site. Well, least mask makes easier look him. math, means 14 million people infected track total deaths

Even more, active cases caused deaths yet. 2 million reported active cases unfortunately result additional deaths.

If go closed cases only, 7% case-fatality ratio. true infection-fatality ratio estimated 0.5-1%, actual cases easily under-counted factor 10. another science/reality denier? 

A 28% increase deaths irrelevant you? Especially started ramping three weeks infection rate started spiking?

You joking here... sure three weeks ago blabbering deaths increasing. 

Well guess what.

And media certainly covering it. confronted president directly two days ago crying loud. I'm glad ultimately said this. needs try way fucking harder convince supporters wear months saying dont work. quibble you. almost [140,000 testimonies crying dirt, American casualties Vietnam Korea combined... 45 times many died 9/11... 5 Maybe enough. Knowing millions long-lasting effects afterward's adds gravity situation.

How many people personally know died this? lost three, far. minimize purely theoreti-troll purposes. people much citizen human you.

There many causes death. Let assure virus leprosy, left people's faces covered scars, people vanity would trump 'freedoms', Spring Break parties would empty. disagree? Seems like national news day yesterday.  Asian cities far denser California. Many substantially larger even NYC.

The virus spread Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei Singapore much Orange County. virus spread apartment walls spreads people take seriously. essence... socialism followed fu-capitalism bet, would put money increasing death toll next weeks decreasing death toll? 100% poll #s completely unrelated compassion, logic, science, empathy. realize thanks info. think got downvoted people realize u file covid reasons. also crazy high percentage Americans live paycheck paycheck, regardless income. going unemployment reduce what, ~ 60% pay (ignoring 600 bump) think lot people can't that. see comment think that's non-starter. know lot teachers can't even make end January without using credit cards. Like every year know get paid early December winter break budget (as well budgeting gifts previous months paychecks) , something psychologically makes spend money bank go negative time next check comes around. We've watching strain potency pretty closely this. think we'd know now, you? easy find citation true.   Schools *do* shut flu. Here's high school, here's elementary school.

Yes, long term school shut large negative impacts children--but concept shutting school control flu pretty mundane public health procedure already happens. that's flu, disease vaccine helps inhibit spread.  deaths, I'm point worried staff. seeing increasing cases children hot spot areas. Biggest one day increase 42 days, actually (BNO). did! budgeted $50 wireless headphones found $150 pair $70. 

But I'm still busting ass money. debatably important wardrobe upgrade. headlines start this.

I hope get break pandemic (and US close borders things heat politically), eventually explore moving back Europe. Right seems like pipe dream. Sounds like ""paid exposure"" extra steps. China Virus.   I'm starting think ""successful"" path exist. propagated lucky shit everything goes right them. That's crazy. bring interesting point. Halloween. 
How going different year? covid19 still around, kids going going house house? optimistic way looking guess. Bars closed serve food allowed serve alcohol. new restriction stop places really bar kitchen know living wage stated higher $13.70/hr person get part time know living wage know surviving NY nursing home policy led deaths 32,000 people.

32,000!?

Last week (2 months decision reversed), [the total chance cite source claim? explanation, he's decent human being. don’t say part NY massively worse death rate.

As someone New York, death rates states never surpass New York's, I'd absolutely fine that. counterfeit anymore, made slaves. Tfw black friday 2020 remembered death people talk say everybody else needs worry. Yes, April worse now. August, it'll worse states (FL, CA, TX, etc.) getting hammered. Already today, U.S reports 1,000 deaths far likely included next hours  So, first time voting (I turned 18 right last elections registered vote time) understanding politics surrounding elections super great. reelections causing change tune? realizing likely win trying win people acting like bumbling buffoon? *months* responsible leader help US navigate crisis spent whole time head sand. Lol, fucking tough guy here. Asking people follow rules private property engage behavior could harm others ""calling someone out"" deserving spit on. Fuck you. in, bread comes slices. Shit Magazine. shelves durr. second this. always poll numbers. sure low covid deaths Florida high Pneumonia deaths.... weird right?

Fake news, according Fresh Uighur slave camps... also held 2 weeks border. press conference embarrassing.

Same talking points repeated weeks/months.  Still patting back (arguably ineffective) closures. Still reporting inaccurate/incomplete stats testing- though saying ""among lowest"" instead ""the lowest"" mortality.

And absolutely details plan going forward. details reopening. details plans schools.  

What point thing? Well never really either since we're republic. interesting types narcissism bankrupt logic. Thank summary. Consider essential expendable like rest us. Welcome new world order. said wear mask can.

Shows damned briefing without mask. I’ve noticed numbers week don’t seem skyrocketing like last week, although part assumes that’s due decreased testing delays getting testing results based facts? based Trumps alternative facts? Objectivists.  test balloon.... Minimum wage != Livable wage

How fuck bonehead obviously cannot think beyond first step equation several steps. children infect parents; teachers; bus drivers; school janitor; school support staff; everyone else come contact with. 

The sheer idiocy kind crap displays incomprehensible. forced set office large school of, say 5-600 middle school age children, stay infected. simple math.

The critical cases 10% total infections.

So take 3,000,000 / 10 * 100 get 30,000,000. False sense security fucking what?! sort large downtrend swing aware last week? Cases soaring, 1,000 people already died Texas alone week fucking Tuesday. Yes. doubt mind. people get upset wearing mask, I'm sure type people cry foul (rightly) body slammed disgusting act. bet can't even say city right now! know state test turnarounds 24 hours swab send program. According NY Times 200% testing requirements one best country. hit miss, anymore people obviously taking frustrations us. definitely suck cause admittedly baby. I'm good confrontation people yelling me. managers always pretty good backing us though understanding feel need walk away. totally 100% agree, trouble state's want can't pay unemployment feds coughing reasonable financial assistance individuals business owners really.

So closing luxury recreational nonessential businesses, shoves people unemployment poverty Titanic would also fun Yeah, poll numbers. know I'm Florida results test took yesterday probably null void next day I've possibly exposed. Honestly would bet want avoid obstinate customers. kids drop like fucking flies supposed tell teens can’t work see friends plan sending back school month? 

That's exact issue I'm struggling - except us back school 2 weeks. book pickup today high school. 

The ""big change"" corona virus control? Wear masks, water fountains, lots signs say 'social distance'.  limited group (one class level time) - school tables set lines directly next other, nothing indicate people stay spaced waiting line, etc. 

If even gently push social distancing parents building staff running tables, really expect anything try keep kids wearing masks staying apart school.

Completely convinced today school taking seriously closing 2 3 weeks opening due major outbreak. (Our state starting tick upwards I'm giving couple weeks last vacationers return FL passed around bit symptoms start showing shortly school opens.) Checked 1,054 worldometers. since maths school I'm pretty sure 1,054 higher 1,002. Worldometer cut like another hour two think. guys highly upvoted posts Doctor weeks ago. considered ""low quality"" disagree? That's pathetic, sorry... doctor Oxford University - low quality? Seems like thing dad ever make toxic person. one asked Google website Target testing sites?  respect approach--I'm way (expect consequences show respect, act accordingly). seems like people already engaging follow rules private establishment, disrespecting everyone else. pissed someone tells follow rules. minding business alone park something totally different situation. Worldometers showing 1,054. Total might closer 1,100 CA TX finish reporting. Initially, thought US may beat Brazil today, happen. big numbers AZ, SC GA, attributed delayed reporting weekend, SC GA rising steadily last week. several states like TN, NV, MS, OH LA rising trends still substantially 50 per day moment. What? New cases stable anything beginning drop. 4000 less today last Tuesday. Ignorant title.

First all, Los Angeles never ""stay-home"" order. Rather, had, ""Safer Home Order."" Moreover, subject modifications, Order remained place continuously throughout present 'emergency.' Even now, subject exceptions, 

""all persons living within City Los Angeles hereby ordered remain homes."" also seem give fuck families rush punt kids back school, vacation hot spots, guilt grandma coming 90th birthday bash adult children baby showers, etc.

It's living best life pandemic. Wanna bet?

I think testing, cheap reliable rapid tests least important develop. Maybe people meet lot clients, like cashiers tested quickly every week, could slow virus?
Or people arriving intercontinental flights? Cuz another rally attempt. Florida 5 months prepare knew would happen didn't. I'm Floridian failed miserably mention asymptomatic patients study 42 people?  early signs cases (and positivity rate) stabilizing recently, deaths definitely keep going least 2 weeks, probably 3-4 weeks. question much go cases really really stabilizing start going down.

I Siberian Husky dog. considered suspend walks ends, Husky really likes going out.

Her walks done night time street quasi empty, precisely avoid meeting people, quasi empty mean meet like 1 person corner block side street.

Should wear mask walking her? reason, Trump actually terrible economy since allowed oil war occur impact economy? 

And say blame that, need address appropriate praise economy well, appropriate blame economy poorly. really can't ways. 

People warn would pandemic would blunder it. paying attention. people familiar normal typical threats country known potential pandemic appropriate steps reduce risk years. includes Pentagon prior administrations. Yet, Trump administration cut numerous major operations designed reduce risk mitigate damage pandemic.  pledge allegiance written 1890's dude. Sweden doing! He’s totally losing it. tweet certifiable. correct. relatives straight tell I’m helping “the government” say people wear masks, despite a) fact I’m NYC, b) fact multiple members family *including me* particularly vulnerable due various health conditions.

Shoppers threaten violence anything. customer threaten shoot ASM told skip line. guy punch manager followed outside stealing. Another guy said 50%! Could’ve used better photo, vehicles 60s anything demonstrate need funding! Maybe Ebola pandemic, government actually listened US 2 deaths? He's advised 6 presidents many global health issues. Meanwhile, current administration contradicts almost every turn voila, 150k Covid deaths.

Yes, originally said people wear masks. also later said PPE short supply enough masks health workers public started panic buying masks. That's reversed public stance couple months later hard-hit states improved PPE supply.

Oh, since seem angry Fauci's ""don't wear mask"" statement already reversed several months ago, also angry Trump since Trump dissuading people wearing masks since December last year last week? THATs big unknown, people way carefree regard... *Next* Easter. make legal deliver ffs. 

Also someone tell Texas legalize pot guy doesn’t wear mask lol. Pretty great. death curve continuing decline, despite increase cases. Perhaps beautiful China Virus we've ever seen. absurd daily deaths average back April Cuomo's disastrous decision empty hospitals long-term patients send back nursing homes so, spread virus nursing homes, resulting inflated averages VS total number cases. actually happened Québec, reason.

Now, got ""true"" (assuming Florida Texas reporting data accurately) numbers, went ≈400 ≈800 day past month. Nothing's flattened here... attitude.  Friday 13th lol. 2.5yo loves wearing mask. helps made mickey mouse one. Haha. even wants wear around house.

And grown men whine worse babies, look grown. another province work last month. breakfast room service all. stayed 2 weeks filth unable vacuum get new sheets. Towels available, least.

Of course, price. Based polls, currently 10-20%. Biden largest lead point election cycle several decades. 2020 shrug. Hm wonder many people attend Inauguration Day...with masks course!! /s breaking news: “Water wet!” republic. Say pledge allegiance one time.

I mean, says something ""people dying"" actually something emotionally stirs you. think that's sort entire point dialogue, pretty clear care people dying self-control.

Well, one favorite examples medical industry popularized dieting made people believe better weight loss exercise human population got big today started needing much food.

They would studies compare people exercise effectively people diet effectively, minimize timeline studies maximize temporary effects dieting minimizing long-term effects exercise, bribe media use outlets say dieting effective, make people likely believe it, say study saw dieting effective, even though actually saw people dieting effectively perfect amount time show wide discrepancy possible barely-exercising group.

This way, wealthy people cake eat too. Obese people discouraged exercising likely stay habits overpaying food poor nutritional value per dollar. want lose weight, they'll overpay *other* food poor nutritional value per dollar, food designed make lose weight.

It's big part due scientific training. see little evidence, opinion take measures. Remember, beginning said virus passed human human. took thousand dead figure evidence human human transmission.

Then ""it's transmitted lick another persons mucus dripping nose"". Again, many tens thousands dead occurred maybe droplet transmission way happens. 

Now 500,000 dead countless infected scientists finally figured actually good idea wear masks indeed work directions (for wearer protect others).

EU leaders agree long-term budget corona package

UPDATED TODAY 08:18

PUBLISHED TODAY 05:35

After four days two nights negotiations, leaders EU countries agreed early morning long-term budget corona package.
- it! EU strong, EU united, says EU Council President Charles Michel press conference together EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, writes TT.

- good deal strong deal. importantly, right deal EU right now. shown confidence common future, adds Michel.

French President Emmanuel Macron Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès also positive deal.

- historic day EU, Macron writes Twitter.

- good deal. Never EU decided invest ambitiously future, writes Wilmès

The deal involves corona support 750 billion euros, 390 billion grants. long-term budget, turn, lands EUR 1,074 billion years 2021-27.

In case support package, grant component support package reduced EUR 390 billion, loan component EUR 360 billion. distribution means relatively large shift initial situation 500 billion grants 250 billion loans, even Sweden's four frugal countries' starting bids entire package would consist loans. weekend's negotiations, ""the frugal ones"" reached 375 billion paid grants.

Bigger discount Sweden

The agreement means Sweden receives significantly higher discount EU fee, almost SEK 11 billion year - EUR 1,069 million.

The increasing budget still means Sweden's EU fee increase pure money, approximately SEK 6 billion around SEK 45 billion year. share gross national income (GNI), however, estimated last seven years - 0.8 per cent GNI - Riksdag required order approve settlement

Sweden's negotiators accepted compromise late last night. State Secretary Paula Carvalho Olovsson explained shortly 11 pm last night Swedish press corps Sweden ready say yes.

- proposal now, see several things gone way, terms climate ambitions, discounts conditions, said.

""The question rule law has, addition grants, difficult, think go way, not, settlement,"" said Carvalho Olovsson.

OK EU committee

Late evening, Riksdag's EU committee also gave green light. committee's chairman Åsa Westlund (S) announced free Stefan Löfven approve proposal.

- would say given clear mandate say yes, says TT.

BRIEF COMPROMISE PROPOSAL

Here key points Charles Michel's latest compromise proposal:

Corona support lands 750 billion euros, 390 grants 360 loans.

Several EU funds would received extra money corona support significantly reduced, including climate change fund, make basic budget 7.5 billion euros long-term budget corona supplement 10 billion. order receive climate money, longer need promise nationally climate-neutral 2050.

An extra sentence introduced wording rule law emphasize audits carried ""impartially basis evidence"".

Countries proposed allowed keep 25 percent customs revenue collect, instead 20 percent previous proposals.

The long-term budget years 2021-27 proposed amount 1,074 billion euros, reduction 26 billion compared European Commission's proposal. Five countries proposed receive discounts membership fees: Germany receives EUR 3,671 million year (unchanged latest proposal), Netherlands receives 1,921 (+ 345 million rebate), Sweden 1,069 (+246), Austria 565 (+278 ) Denmark 322 (+ 100).

Like common knowledge healthcare workers back feb/mar. watching wuhan nurse youtube, see discussing this.

Yay loads debt grandchildren pay off! Pass caviar, geniuses. Ok, question though, would exhaling mask re-inhaling virus particles increase load? happened back 2003 2004, able dig old articles. remember reading back then. That's America ***is*** getting dumber dumber [Here I'm asshole goes Facebook debate friends posts anti-mask bullshit. slightly better chance changing minds total strangers.

Someone call bullshit. Fortunately, kind entertaining me. even reading replies? Ambulance service.

That hardly specific. situation ambulance service petioned newcomers. city mentioned. reasoning it. anything hospitals that's ridiculous. huge nation. idiot DC know what's best Jane Somecity

But think guy big chair whose goal money does? ever reddit internet, sir/madam?

Sir. yeah, tend challenge them. want things like free education, universal healthcare, government control. want destroy housing stock, rebuild homogeneously, government determine prices, loss pension earnings true. meant ""more giving"", general. Must added ""money"" habit. think matters money? I'd give weight countries time rather single, one-off year. yes, I'll agree US currently stands #1 ""most giving country

In case yes, US ranked #1 giving general. money matters me, simply refuting claim Americans give money. know meant 11 2. edit

2 makes sense 11th though. article shared literally 11th giving money. mistakenly said 2nd previous post, said ""sorry, top there"" shit done long time ago. said excuse wear one since “god” tweeted patriotic wear one. Oh yes, physical distancing called social distancing, editorial newspaper called blog ...

Greetings 1984. someone else mentioned infectious dose, another similar concept viral loading. amount virus introduced organism determine severity initial infection well rate host displays symptoms etc. sure incubation periods, virus exponential growth starts higher position population. 

Similarly Petri dish bacteria becomes confluent said completely covered bacteria- maximal amount colonies. confluence accomplished quicker increase inoculation loading. inoculate plate multiple passes overgrown plate, new plate also becomes confluent, much quicker original plate original plate came one single simple inoculation. Maybe I'm base (and hopefully Cunningham's Law lead right answer am) wear gloves strategically help least little. Like wear gloves grocery store, take handle credit card, phone, etc I'll touching bare hands anyway. always crossover, like mask could reduce initial load, using glove gives couple degrees separation even cases lessen viral load there. Like said, viral load **correlated** symptom severity hundred bucks 10 minutes install? honestly practical cheap way prevent infecting whole family. Maybe never Arizona. Tbh kinda amazing already still don’t know anyone who’s gotten symptomatic. people who’ve lucky enough avoid that, it’s easy feel like it’s distant problem distant people. would like volunteer duck experiment. THANK YOU!!! Everyone thinks it’s easy strike it’s nbd. consequences so. 

People threads also think teachers ones making final decisions, far ones making choices. It’s insane many people calling us go work think fix everything, state give “they choice” 

They do, negatively impact everyone years come go battle states via strike right now. Can't take anywhere. I'm one lousy low person crying? I'm seeing reading reply lol

I open minded somewhat progressive religion worst virus there. state chimney! drastic times require drastic change. matter. still hard time fully recovering (even perfectly fit) even ""beaten"" virus.  Reopen low level people's better judgement, shut months later much higher level pretend that's good thing? problem Says country keeping children cages, separated parents. mean “train” immune system? Yeah here. I'm even going back school now. Cannot relate ""I hate spouse"" memes. never could begin even can't relate. 6'8TALLChadOx1 well NY especially Special Ed. cant fill position. prove 1 year taking courses getting certified. Interesting! Thanks sharing.  February, nobody knew anything virus back then. cloth masks work everyone wears them, one person plane. Get fuck wear mask holy shit. Even couple months ago Fauci saying 18 months minimum vaccine. crazy people really distrustful one coming soon, lots lots people follow news science closely, course lots people hearing first time.  wish people would pay attention. even really anything know. Previous studies shown severity symptoms related viral load healthcare workers high risk getting sick(er). wearing mask reduces exposure, thus reducing severity sickness. feel like I've seen months data relatively similar points thing - wear fucking mask. almost like people dedicated whole lives shit like know fuck they're talking something. woulda thought? many people study? 🤔 talking entire loan amount forgiven, interest.  Welp can't blame anyone wanting death threats, although links workings home particular  remember kid used hang around group friends got working out. Sick fucking dog idiot still goes gym. Getting less virus exposure doesn’t mean symptoms less severe. hundreds factors determine severity illness. tried get happen Trump elected. timing somewhat coincidental, definitely felt like miss much leaving whole mess behind.

Then work out, stuck waiting find COVID 19 job hilariously labeled ""essential"". see guys video person wearing masks, think calling “Karen” makes people focus women think understand pressure Florida teachers given no-strike state. They'd risking everything. would basically need teachers board strike. They're lose-lose situation deserve vitriol. know it’s hard remain optimistic hope. Hang there. 

On cynical level there’s much money made finding administering vaccine. 

On humanitarian level, there’s enough make happen. 

Use statnews follow vaccine/therapy progress. Stay strong safe. would great time start taxing religious institutions last line vaccine (as be)

The way think it, youngish healthy people one first groups get vaccines, especially lot. Transmission risk much higher, would really important herd immunity massively reduce transmission. Great news, Houston may leveling 4-5 times higher back April May ignored everyone's advice reopening.


/$ want fucking vaccine! one horse sized duck? people passed concerned, option go trail. pandemic, taking seriously can't stay hiking trail. one NEEDS go hiking. luxury. people high risk, like said, many accept risks. okay. 5% people innoculate way get full disease, innoculate billion people, caused 50 million infections. That's good attitude - also example others.

But article suggests wearing masks may actually far - may reduce chances develop serious symptoms actually get infected. Except mainly anti mask areas. poor fools, may rest peace. agree. I’ll quit go back classroom. many won’t. don’t means without pay, finding new job right isn’t exactly easy. Agree possible may deploy type testing high positivity areas. areas lower certain rate, use this? they've counted. I'll bet Brazil Venezuela two countries Americas biggest under-count error.  mean, lot better sars 2003. know 6 months something like that. really doesn't. Seen read plenty stories fit people tough time fighting virus. muh freedoms Probably country forgot Idaho exists hmm dots comments. Ad blockers maybe filtering blocking scripts? EDIT: NM, comment high enough options bar automatically expands shows save comment option. far dots appear. Thanks though realize arguing people wear masks early data hospitalized cohorts found association viral load severity symptoms. one virion infect single cell quickly release hundreds virions plausible initial viral titer might matter much. it’s made corporation 🙃   Exactly. understand case natural immunity vaccine immunity last :( [John lost national elections *millions* votes. people?

Immediately checked history. Realized far right conspiracy theorist. people dont even believe science.

Im actual engineer scientist. degrees. watch ancient aliens. Youre season 15. still watching.

Your opinions therefore rendered laughable.

Have nice breastfeeding woman's immune system works milk absurd. Sounds funny, legit thing. little, late, asshole. bought 24 shares like 6 years ago whim, dad told silly, bought 300 shares months later. feel pretty good now, I’m guessing feels even better explain athletes getting show next 0 symptoms. also seem get repeated positives even though show 0 symptoms multiple week durations. Woah case XPCC.

Overall numbers look better, hopefully actual reflection measures taking effect rather noise. BTW, ""viral load"" somewhat different concept. amount virus blood get infected, like viral particles per mililiter similar.

OP talking viral *exposure*, infectious dose - amount virus initially gets body. Public school teachers tough spot. know students' safe place classrooms. students get fed school. However, parents use public school daycare drop kid school even clearly sick. agree saying much, feel like could written this. soooo done people acting right now. live state rapidly spiking numbers, half people know taking super seriously quarantining, working home possible, socializing. half basically acting normally. Maybe eating bit less going extended vacations (though know have), otherwise business usual. Restaurants (insanely) still open, bars closed stay open guise “we restaurant too” crap people packed them.

I trouble maintaining cool around family members. views always disagreed years, I’ve able get subject changed “agree disagree” civil fine. though, keep pressuring husband see them, passive aggressive don’t. seen ONE person grocery store workers fast food/delivery staff since early March. Worked home entertained inside home walked local wildlife trail. Always wear masks, eating restaurants, lots handwashing. We’re pretty introverted totally happy right safe thing stay inside together. missed weddings, funerals, birthdays, Mother Father’s Day celebrations, etc. one gotten pass – video call chat phone much want, nothing person, sorry. people would ones meet us park, wear mask, hug us. literally wouldn’t even asked; want congregate favorite restaurant go vacation them. people work medical field aren’t social distancing, hell would meet up??

The statement “it’s bad, young fine” thrown around bear. I’m totally afraid dying, unlikely, like possible medical bills?? Complications possible extended health issues? sick capacity sucks, like, even minor cold isn’t fun. viewed like insane people wanting risk getting sick see us hour? BEYOND understanding. friends sick 20s problems, know people died. increasingly become angry year people know, government response, etc. sorry dealing something similar. hope stay safe healthy. 


 

Edit: also enraged done everything “right”, haven’t seen anyone engaged anything risky, yet bunch friends going parties fun I’m like man wish could together, don’t feel like fair guess. **loved** spaghetti sammiches kid. Honestly can't think reason norm....

Then again, honestly can't think reason wear mask rn I'm little lost weve managed make masks political. Here's hoping people take public health seriously future There's always someone! Lol congrats I’d imagine New York got hit cases higher death rate. masks (initially) combined high population density, packed subways, etc. Probably much larger viral load people got infected. Wait. mean get different ""levels"" COVID? Wait, symptoms depend much virus take in? virus multiply body? first hear I'm curious learn more. 

I always imagined 1 virus enough cause infection. entirely true? also increased exposure. really sure nurses trusted doctors, nurses trained decide treatment plan, especially complex ICU patients. 

The one video believe referencing travel nurse typically work ICUs quickly fired crazy things like accusing doctors killing patients. got fox tell story get lot undeserved attention. She'll probably write book it. 

There's thing broad spectrum antiviral wide spread use, maybe there's getting researched. good reason believe hydroxychloroquine might help, good peer reviewed data suggest actually does. Studies still ongoing. maybe help, maybe doesn't. science still needs done. Promoting cure irresponsible that's known case. 

Finally implying COVID 19 created spread intentionally stupid. came animals, likely bats, like flu viruses do, like HIV did. developed countries got quick handle it. lack leadership, current administration's lack interest letting experts decide policy, intentionally underfunded government programs committees place deal issues like this. fuck. Fuck Americans.

These idiots trying fucking kill us. STAY OUT.  Oh yeah get sure. temporary measure I’m suggesting take. covid blows sometime next year (hopefully) go back practicing earnest again. anything, practice help maintain whatever learned.  😂😂😅😜😜😜 case, without saline placebo evidence safety, claim safety fraudulent. reactive guess so, lot medical teams(testing teams doctors) heading Urumqi. US work collectively NY sending medical teams states, lot veteran medical personnels now, people much aware situation. still Americans fail demonstrate collective social repsonsibility. Urumqi posed stay home order 4 hours every street clear. happen United States. working smaller construction company, factory expansions, installing bridge cranes, etc... could never understand people could work places, standing thing over, plus noise stink. No, would fight try get teachers cave. Thus prolonging start year, teacher pay would stop (our last paycheck last school year 8/7), wouldn’t able pay bills feed families time, potential career educators 20+ years job lose retirement scary. 

We need change law amend constitution allow educators right strike like states. one wants take task TLDR: 3 new imported cases, 8 new domestic case, 1 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 5 new domestic asymptomatic carriers

Anything go Florida. governor said schools CANNOT remain closed. things encourage spread go. Doesn’t virus multiply? would less different day 0 never knew? Cruise ship + Disney sounds like absolute hell Curious behavior changed areas resisting masks first. way track that, even anecdotally? 

I haven’t seen someone public building without mask since April.  live Japan people wear there’s high pollen count they’re worried hay fever.

Someone knew would wear lot A/C work never cleaned.

So yeah there’s reasons besides sick people wear stigma probably different.

Also they’re great acne lower face want hide 😅 Consider Canada. huge desi diaspora less racism Europe. Yes cause virus particles get caught mask, particles small even see masks catches them, microns small.  Seems legit, kids home microscope see holes cloth mask. like one prisoner acting vs entire prison riot. one prisoner starts acting much likelier he'll suppressed chance rally gather reinforcements, enough guards time gather reinforcements. (I'm starting think bad analogy...) France correct term? I'd also like know  ok? blame them.   theory I’m glad it’s true eat ton Brussels sprouts. Hope helps! surgeon start paying attention April? dominant position. wear mask, likely touch face get Covid. warned wear masks would actually incr vitamin change calculus? Anecdotally, supposed good thing enough. coronavirus news. thought head CDC said 90% infections asymptomatic anyway quite misleading three parents! Think possibilities! vaccine 2 pronged attack virus, yes really amazing. antibodies cell response.

If choice... would others due cell reaction vaccine invokes. think viral load refers amount virus system given time infection, infectious dose much virus inhale get infected. create negative pressure room outward facing box fan window put towel door. good enough keep significant airborne virus making it’s way back return (depending return located). Would also recommend surgical mask keep virus getting airborne first place. better solution inward facing window unit doesn’t support outward ventilation. economy especially stockmarket zombified. anything causes abandonment US dollar, it. There's asymptomatic version disease, different virus. 

Some people get sick, die.   ... hardly specific. situation ambulance service petioned newcomers. city mentioned. reasoning it. anything hospitals built.

Situation specific definitely lacked details. common states: law allows ambulance company executives serve councils and, installed, use preferred status protect incumbency expel rivals providers great cost taxpayers good government.

. think guy big chair whose goal money does? 

I'd point retail industry allows customers maximize buying power. Businesses find ways lower costs consumers benefit. guess vision line founding fathers. rely community, local government, state. federal government last resort step fill yeah, tend challenge them. want things like free education, universal healthcare, government control. want destroy housing stock, rebuild homogeneously, government determine prices, loss pension earnings etc.

I dont know... ones ever deal see/listen talk abolishing private property, away capitalism, ""workers owning means production"". landlord, _exploiting_ tenants. Etc. Probably left field watched Joe Biden say going away ""shareholder capitalism"", ie, abolish/end stock market. simply refuting claim Americans give money. 

Fair enough. Thank keeping honest. Abbott also overrode mask mandates issued mayors judges earlier. Poop him! someone tell lady actually listen Ben Shapiro. talking hyper sterile environments causing childhood leukemia reason wear them.

In case, retract original statement. Commenting bookmark old Reddit. best Reddit. click save. dosage matter, like drug/chemical dosage (involving LD50)?

im curious viruses &amp; bacteria reproducing doesnt dosage moment exposure don’t understand reply. sell? poor cash flow problem. Yes, window AC cheaper hospital bill, don’t $300 dollars spare it’s still unaffordable. That’s even mention lost work occurring. majority Americans live paycheck paycheck. amount bootstrapping positive thinking fix problem enforce choose to. That's real issue. actually enforce it? That's real question. Since gathering outdoors at-risk persons involved, wise prudent everyone wear mask.

Perhaps could craft mask? troubles wearing mask. Well Massachusetts pretty well we're biotech hub? Mask wearing norm quarantined HARD Oh however get potatoes didn’t take precautions, hospitals would overwhelmed death rate would soar. See: Italy. It’s low mortality rate modern medicine. apparently eyes too. Requiring glasses makes feel slightly better. much protection, least direct shots covered Think like firefighters, forests, lightning strikes.

While always possible single lightning strike grow biggest ever forest fire, sometimes put quickly. There's still partial relationship many lightning strikes come badly burning likely be. concept immunotherapy/allergy shots build immunity. also explains young Dr's taken right outta game exposed high initial inoculum.  China, day news broke nationally unknown virus outbreak, *the fucking night* Dr Zhong Nanshan (the Chinese equivalent Dr Fauci) national TV demonstrating properly wear surgical mask.

They wait around proof studies. early evidence virus spread via air somehow. used common sense covering mouth nose probably good idea dealing virus enters fucking mouth nose. soon definitive proof virus spread via droplets, early February, masks made mandatory *nationwide* public places. 

Even dumbest, poorest, uneducated Chinese person understood followed suit wearing masks *months*. whole anti-mask situation US embarrassing. Meanwhile everyone Washington state flocking Idaho lack restrictions. Read OP's sentence shit, put filter air breathe, it’s gonna ~~limit~~ ~~toxic elements~~ breathe in. Please wear mask everyone.

replace ""toxic elements"" ""virus load"". 
replace ""limit"" ""reduce"".

happy? even though proven people either catch again,

Not proven. jury still conclusion, reinfection SARS-CoV-2 seems unlikely taking consideration knowledge viral neutralizing antibody duration past respiratory illnesses, type specimen collection technical errors associated component swab testing, methods used discharging patients, presence fecal viral RNA without evidence replication-competent virus fecal swabs, finally reassurance animal study. till enough data suggest patients noninfective, must maintain vigilance convalescence period also must take consideration probability genetic mutations observed rather reinfection someone born raised FL since visited rest country lived 4 states, Floridians stupid anyone else, something... different. lol. /r/CursedCursedComments wouldn’t article written though...come on. begin taking away small group’s rights vote, expand group, minorities can’t vote, rich old white guys can

I should’ve replied person though Thanks. know that. It’s almost like way virus infects body similar virus infects population.

When there’s enough time prepare things overwhelm system, usually able recover faster develop tools limit spread. Damn... Stay strong!  true. 

The fact responsibility shifted White House, states, way teachers, disgusting. Yeah, air window unit eventually make way home's air return same. Spilling nationalism looks one best scientific achievements century makes wanna throw up. curious ""the dose makes poison"" applied viruses too. Guess do. Hmm seems like good life pro tip talking friends. I'm commenting come back case ever one. using logic, masks would required every flu season anyone info clusters r viruses like do... *B u n e s* get spend one week every april beautiful state, miss year, sure allowed back Spoken like true scientist engineer.

Don't hug face bullshit makeshift masks. sneeze go straight shit. Shapiro said wear masks every single episode since lockdowns. screw church. deserve nothing. non profit organizations pay income taxes pay payroll taxes, real estate taxes, personal property taxes etc. Many organizations play important roles community &amp; seriously hurt pandemic shutdowns. quick write non-profits undeserving federal covid funding.

Wearing mask limit amount pathogens transmitted ( estimated absolute value 8% tested japan lazy find source again)

It mostly : reduce exposure reduce amount exposition exposure.

NBA certainly better MLB's plan NHL's plan even better. held Canadian cities lower numbers addition service workers also tested frequently (something believe NBA doing). work university, got antibody test back around 7 hours PCR test within 24 hours; school trying test staff/on campus personnel month eventually train Trump logic makes sense (well, relative terms), accompanied tweet picture wearing mask, article definitely interpreted correctly  bars closed sports/events. Plenty people able fill them. Nobody going fuck 250 lb linebacker can't hit gym would reflected antibody testing currently show rides run reduced capacity, masks redundant outdoors social distancing followed.  seems like they're picking kind thing rather slowly.  noticed got message yeah.

We're going need lock again. animal study mention injected level 10 times amount seen actual infections real world. Perfect! Natural selection deal Karens, protect (most) damage.  I’ve quarantine-lite since mid-March. I’m working I’ve seen one friend since whole thing started. I’m talking someone seeing social media person, it’s hard notice someone gone.

Well lot religious people Texas might finally realize dream visiting Heaven Jesus real soon  Disaster capitalism action. Never let good crisis go waste They're lungs want cough ICU that's right. AAP disagrees you. say : “\*\*Local school leaders\*\*, public health experts, \*\*educators\*\* \*\*parents\*\* must center decisions reopen schools, taking account spread COVID-19 communities capacities school districts adapt safety protocols make in-person learning safe feasible. instance, schools areas high levels COVID-19 community spread compelled reopen judgment local experts. one-size-fits-all approach appropriate return school decisions.”  old.... frank PPE shortage much value reserving providers really shaming though?

Stop listening bad actors frame honest shortcomings crisis.

With good leadership backed experts, perfect fucking experts, would controversy mostly manufactured. Churches pay taxes. talked neighbor (who lives Florida winter), response:

It’ll never over. Vaccine won’t work. Hospitals going crumble. Society’s over. We’re going get half die.

That’s crawled back rock. Cringe Wait, wear mask, protecting around me, I’m also significantly protecting myself? That’s great news.

I know many people refuse wear mask. know I’m protecting germs, wonderful. get upset people turn masks political issue instead health issue. Someone told “my body, right.” Idiotic. 

If wear mask, shield, gloves, I’m even protected, right? That’s great. That's problem, research clear cut now. problem selfish people grasping straws mildly inconvenienced wearing mask. flimsy excuse conflicting mask information. screams entitlement. change it...some gone full conspiracy nutso anti mask. got person today. see way things, im maga,and certain things, totally blind him, understand things... personally WHOLE TIME like whole ...iffy thing masks basically hoping would finally stop stupid bullshit wear mask...and stop giving anti mask crowd cake.

and im happy!! finally today. seems administration went full 180 past day listened fauci surgeon general president said ""wear mask wear social distancing can't done!"" this.

he said ""im hardcore supporter! FUCK HIM! im supporting anymore"" im like wtf?! O.o mask!!? LOL. funny see people called ""supporters"" completely turn back encouraging masks listening fauci surgeon general LOL. Neither would I. I've lived Sonora desert SoCal, Texas even Midwest was, opinion, far oppressive summer. Hands down. whole dry vs. wet heat joke.  Cringe Owch. warn someone zombie plague coming refuse believe you? work city requires masks within 6ft someone else weeks. 10% coworkers follow rules. people took work March, ones returned weeks later wear masks. 

Their reasoning map, Tim foil hat conspiracies, believing science, believing rare random 'science' says there's nothing do. Racism hypocrisy aside I’m glad finally this. Weeks ago someone asked I’d accept trump promoting mask, he’s going racist so....I’d say yes. Pyrrhic victory guess.

I’m glad happened holy fucking shit, I’m surprised disappointed it. Reddit, free speech Democrat speech. Reddit Liberal stronghold super unbalanced. It’s pretty much Democrat echo chamber wish big issue subs like actually balanced.


All downvotes really prove point. isn’t place discussion. It’s partisan circle-jerking. Yeah, seems like irresponsible headline. People dying Covid become angels. Americans can't trusted take headline literally. 😂 99.96% infected survive. Imagine letting media control thoughts. weak individual. telling lives dispensable?

Yay scientist! lol proved smallest school can't even manage distancing, wants schools decide....schools clearly decide open Absolutely Hint morons: tracking device already embedded within life. It’s pocket.  Oh, no. They've seen polls. They're gonna claim they've pro mask wearing along. Praise be. infinite QE involved... Gold already went liquidity scare back March. pullbacks, Fed obviously hellbent destroying purchasing power USD, so... Gold important part anyone's portfolio. Usually 5% fine, days I'd say 10 - 20% apt. get caught hyper-inflation without gold... way stocks immune gravity despite crisis, I'd say we're heading kind inflationary scare / DXY (USD vs currencies) decline.

I'd say wait gold pull back though. close old highs without pullback yet, may surprise everyone blue sky breakout without pull back. There's also massive amount short interest paper gold market, gold heavily manipulated years, shorts need buy cover break out. inflationary pressures seem way high gold break eventually.

Gold even good investment great depression, greatest deflation modern history. revalued $25 $35 something Roosevelt. course, first made private ownership gold illegal re-valued it, times get tough, rules simply change. Nope. since '70s.

You point, bad boy. That’s virus works can't really answered without knowing country (or world) are. CBs receivers breathing other. get started line dlinemen.  I'm going work every day people work nuts think covid hoax talk them. really miss structured exercise poor self motivation. also said “the surgeon general &amp; Fauci said wear masks” odd doesn’t seem messaging sure mask thing comes play obviously.  Americans traveling lot car/etc remote places.  sort connection full article, ""TMC statistics show dip testing trends end June/early July, seeing current dip hospitalizations."". 

Positivity exploded dip, FYI. deserve it. 

Yes do. Nah. Hold people accountable actions. Especially among highest ranking medical professionals world. Missouri, work public institution set state. I'm unemployment reduced hours. reduced hours make social distancing possible, allowed work home anymore. Several people left retired, positions filled.

Our hypocritical governor started requiring work searches penalties businesses beginning July. lock sick kid away hope come ok weeks? fuck planet want combine thread make Jufran spaghetti. Actually no, sounds horrible kinda like Jufran. reference, Gen Z'ers here.

[Pt Right?

I deleted fb ages ago, sort neighborhood version called nextdoor. elderly neighbor posted scared go people ignoring mask guidelines (also law county). 

One couple joined conversation pridefully proclaim nay, shant sheep led slaughter! shall wear masks public! FREE everyone pointing facts wrong salty engaging hate speech!

*I delighted see whole neighborhood collectively tell get fucked.* Oh god right people arent wearing masks me. IM SORRY EVERYONE wear one time!!!!! think I've ever seen social distance. Fox News told fucking idiots wear masks bothers liberals, would. That's asinine deplorables become.  think it’s frustrating try get information stories everything one giant negative circlejerk, like don’t people get angry, demeaning, dismissive makes people want dig heels even more?

But totally agree. It’s completely disastrous fronts. sad thing Democratic standpoint seem content really anything, like bills different things push zero chance getting passed get use leverage elections. It’s big political game seemingly elected officials. get saying observation it’s dumb fucks regardless age. Granted live Florida maybe special kind stupid here. middle aged wear mask everywhere, history anxiety problems related breathing bad trapped London two weeks scared leave hotel room. wear mask reasonable friends. Way big seem recall china drones flying around making sure anyone outside mask on. also advised italy early measures insufficient noone wearing masks. That's problem. dont know 88 oxygen level phone saying 92 94 hypoxic become, less accurate is. Nah. truth seeker trying keep convo honest. Since guy asshole?!

America Democracy respects **rule law**. Simply pandemic going mean stop respecting rule law. people wear them. attempted scold terrible examples. Many people wear seatbelts risk paying fine, picking dogshit risk guarantee, choosing sex require wearing condom. jump orgy legally force everyone wear condoms. least, think would appropriate. Nowadays I'm pretty sure fills administrative role scientific work directly. What...? No. Clearly either trolling illiterate, that's exactly opposite paper I, actually read it, said. still understand bunch money paid essential workers. risk life. no, never got boost pay working it. Social distance learning worthless large number students. huge reason especially. allergy-related coughing. think freaked neighbors one day huge coughing fits. really wanted talk that, got sick

I tested negative SARS-CoV-2, I'm telling that. ever wear masks say

Omelette doh fromage

.... They'll understand I’m not, believe me. can’t stand guy. I’m saying that’s positive. It’s fair, everyone see fair increase, got rid properly stepped raises back 2008-2010ish false promise fighting get something like back Honestly whole time hard respect approach, even respect desired outcome.

Masks: They, entire medical community literally Asia, knew form masking would better nothing. Imagine telling everyone wear cloth masks ramping national program get everyone surgical masks next month. think optics vs. actually happened tell Americans wearing facemasks way.

Lockdown: pushed narrative would lockdown 2-4 weeks ""flatten curve"" medical professional knew shit unless vaccine. Nearly everyone know back March medical assuming would done August latest. Hard blame people talking ""moving goalposts"" that's pretty much exactly did. Meanwhile Australia said, ""okay, six months lockdown is."" least general public knew expect plan.

Testing: Trump blame one nearly entirely, still distrust government.

This guy lost respect long time ago. I'm honest, seems like Trump filled position saw entirely unimportant first Black man found stand way. Get diversity quota way ""unimportant"" position move hiring criminals everywhere else administration. I’m semi facetious. hope critical mask wearing protests. did, didn’t... especially early people started reminding people bad look was. 

Not mention causing police line streets shoulder shoulder corral causing increase Covid cases police departments (and similar increases fire depts responding various calls) 

I’m saying fair it. It’s probably reckless Disney World open. it’s perceived unnecessary. I’m skeptical lot we’ve decided. pile Costco’s want hilarious rules space check lines nothing throughout rest store... throw towel beach mix satan Hitler. 

For someone like me, mostly becomes comical. 

Anyway, stay healthy folks. Take care yourselves. Well, logic terminal cancer patient last days (to put extreme example) dies COVID, excess mortality since said person going die year anyways.

Obesity caused 19 year old people die heart attack. Rare (not rare COVID) happens. Correct one calls bioterrorists don’t. Poe's Law seem think opening market competition. ridiculous. I'm sure using idea losing ability shop around negative patent rules pretty much stops anyway.

I gave specific example. city like San Francisco can't build additional housing.
That's problem. cant open new hospital.. That's problem. Protecting workers safety regulations (that make sense) I'm taking made point that's issue. Unless I've misread first comment, reads like bullet points issues would faced moving away current healthcare system.

Definitely misunderstanding going on. I'm capitalism crony overall applies equal weighting giving money, volunteering, helping stranger. point gov NG money part, overall charitability, used giving money rank

Are saying that's bad thing? things matter money. I'd argue time valuable money.. think? 

And says number 11? Everything see 2019 they're top 2. 2020 yet can't data that... even try though. running Brazil? admire fortitude; even tried. They're interested anything conflicts narrative. Good thing social life. Americans dead broke.

It costs money move - lot money Americans simply have.  1 cell exponentially multiples, early phases it’s easier body identify begin clearing virus

If 100 cells multiple exponentially, see would much harder problem get control?

(This extremely simplified answer)

Say 1 person coming beat up, process get free second call help vs 10 people coming beat up. 10 people going overwhelm lot faster. immune system. exactly headline says. Cashier winn-dixie first job, 20 years ago. long since closed area, sounds like gone downhill since then. 2001 considered ""high-end"" grocery store. maybe viral load matter, place 100% masks, number cases stays low testing center ability test person symptoms, result 95% asymptomatic rate. mean, that's well good, frankly, help since immigration care one way another. better condoms, guess. Yup. tried something new? Like forced serve save white people give fuck you, paid enough meaningfully change remaining 1/3rd entire lives. Right, crime shooting still gone up. Regardless. Also /r/NoNewNormal  Assume you’re referring children pretending leaders here. Soooo distance learning little bit orrrrrr die pass virus others die? obtuse man? positive outcome people decide vote someone Trump. Someone remind 3rd parties! goodrx? doctor pharmacist recommended me, I’ve used often wonder runs maintains it? HIPAA compliant? need be? Probably both... thought masks didn’t really protect wearer stop spread infected No, not. Car accident deaths per year 1.35 million: asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/ True, year wild rollercoaster. people suppose fight this? It’s right force people work congregate decent chance causing life-long harm even death Yes, questionnaire asks many people three different age ranges live with. Positivity exploded dip

I'm glad they're happy. look amount tests conducted though. lot.

Floridas data mess overall. great news. states look Texas done, do, arrive result. agree masks everyone wearing completely ineffective 

Seems like forcing people wear really getting comply 

This really backfired spectacularly hasn’t it... Uhmmmmm we're around 1k dead day now.... think take 3 months push that. It’s weird. thought supposed wake fellow Chinese. used “shut up” mask instead ”闭嘴”, equivalent Chinese. Ikr.
I think ""Freedom Right 101"" class, think? 
People abuse words way much. 
Also grew hearing ""Your duty comes first excising right"". least needs balance. Subsidize parents kids 16. could fraction cost public school. Thanks appreciate it! Honestly test bad all, could everyday need be. went CVS nurse/pharm tech watches advises. Virus cases go brrrr people sea getting infected? someone kindly please advise? Yup, Facebook sits Oculus pushing forward opening virtual schools ways can't even begin imagine. could much better better leadership makes sense sort internal form ""flatten curve"". fast produce antibodies vs fast virus multiply. seems logical getting significant dose virus gives virus head-start.

Yaknow, got one viral cell one antibody, fair fight. got billion viral cells one antibody, he's got work cut him.

(in case obvious - claiming answer, mental picture might work) Yeah, kinda sucks reality liberal bias, eh? found brother lives AZ refuses wear mask. way letting home. following rules Disney.   blame coming US. better worse, long term, keeping 4,000 students school months months? Well, church scam, know... Live - everyone (well friends) getting rent reductions stay ignored guidelines Add time need able make antibodies response vaccine. bet slew tragic stories near future someone gets vaccinated immediately goes incredibly crowded event, get hugely exposed COVID, without meaningful antibodies immunity brought vaccine. 

It likely help person, person gets exposed infected days vaccination, full protection one would expect receive vaccine + 2 weeks (or more?) allow antibodies build up. actually do. One lady even died worked friend mine. boyfriend STILL page meme's sheep wear mask. think even know someone STILL think nothing could actively done prevent it. sister tested positive guess did? Called mom come get kid could stay awhile. course mom went right brat basically putting mom(79) risk. Covid pretty much frog boiling water kinda deal. time realize bad things are, we'll cooked. possible could 1 thing. Same, though live south.
A friends nasty colds lasting weeks, confirmed covid.
I wonder got permanent lung damage. lol like living zombie infested areas. come safe here. know can't get out, save yourselves. think governor understands exponential growth works don’t forget data normally goes down, main thing trajectory. either love it, grew it, farm kids looking opportunity shy physical labor.

Also, kind person asks help computer, cause get it. say, ever need help fixing something, building something, want great drinking friend, never go wrong. don’t remember last time said something Covid wasn’t false outdated. claims: human-to-human transmission, recommendation masks, 99% cases experience fever, asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread (way recently retracted), it’s pandemic, recognizing Covid airborne, ever end? mean clearly we're still problems should. Alameda county bad SoCal numbers trending up. isn’t quite shutting down. initial shutdown nonessential businesses. affecting inside dining, gyms, bars, salons. nonessential businesses remaining open. It’s like going phase 1 phase 2 phase 1.75 wonder americans view mask wearing countries. Sadly masks became political can’t deny that, wonder Americans see japan go “ holy shit japanese government silenced people “ suddenly care debt again. true member states really ""deserve"" financial stimulus, pandemic imo reason enough show solidarity needed suffer financial consequences.

The EU members powerful union. Big assumption military willing use tech fellow citizens. able distinguish rebels ordinary civilians. distinguish civilians supporting rebels dont.

Its silly concerned might US military, cant even win wars 3rd world countries soldiers believe right thing. Sorry ask, I'm pretty square brain.

What would happen mask wearer contracted small dose became asymptomatic, virus passed person one wearing mask? Would effect latter still reduced? cytokine cascade, damage does, lag. 

The true effects survivors (i.e. younger people children today) felt years, maybe decades. like right away? get work visa ever? caring person worry grandchildren, seem like someone who's thought everything through, also need think children now, think children? Sameziess possible couples infect other?  system, believe first came well know use MASH (close line military hospital units) Korean War. scenario walking wounded, observe, intervene, hope.

In circumstance Emergency Room/hospital system cannot treat everyine due capacity, might send home, treat some, others give oxygen bottle morphine otherwise get treatment options physician would choose normal times. lead great outcomes, choosing people best chances, live longer, best outcome set bad choices.

So, things equal younger person might get treated older one wouldn't, maybe thin person fat person, someone disability existing illness someone conditions. I've seen scorecards produced assessed.

Further reading: 7 days higher number today go ""good see deaths down. reason less people die Mondays. shows increasing numbers artefact testing"" already portable window AC unit one hose, make negative pressure room stay prevent spreading droplets rooms house. That's plan get sick. also thing cheap box fan blowing air window. put damp towel bottom door seal little close AC vents room.

Oh boy! get fever I'm hot room, might get heat stroke! Golly Gee, I'm excited! absolutely lowballed Japan (as testing general, due continuing lack availability serious cases, drive keep working matter mild symptoms).

They're going go home possibly infect members family might ""get it."" Stanford Yale studies proved much back guidance wear masks. Huge asymptomatic penetration virus. NY Times recently reported third study also confirming findings NY, something like 75% people tested neighborhoods Covid-19 antibodies without symptoms.

NYC wrecked early often, going second wave it. States hit hard first wave hit hard. coincidence. 

NPR trying report perfect community adoption masks cause 95% cases asymptomatic. scientific question instead 'are 95% cases asymotomatic regardless mask adoption?' Bungo? mean I'm joking 5G specifically I'm serious mistrust China. look way comport global stage can't help suspicious motives. Look Uighurs. nobody wants challenge experiments finally approve anthrax, plague, smallpox recombinant vaccines. Rude. 

/s

E- point being, challenges humans never acceptable. alarming yet I’ve heard little it. Since know virus started animals passed onto pets (I’ve read recently cats got owners) imagine devastating effects passing mosquitos. areas drain sewage directly ocean? Holy crap. one cared was, put mask. heard exact analogy today (or yesterday) Covid-related podcasty thing. It’s great one! tests free still pay that?🤔 Small рр Sounds like schools Canada like schools US. human immune system going weak passes. Less exposure natural irritants bacteria viruses. going lot sick people long time come. indirectly get parents grandparents killed. 

They probably get loss fair years too. Please call even censorship platform made opposite? Aaron Schwartz crying grave reading bullshit. family carbon monoxide detector go asleep. one far away bedrooms. get think, oh broken, running batteries. decided like eh better safe sorry opened windows etc. bought new detectors morning totally carbon monoxide house. scary realization we'd considered worrying it. agree decision, although think ways title misleading mainly article potentially misleading. Firstly, interview really reliable source even claim 95% asymptomatic infection factory. track peer reviewed source claim stating fact. Secondly, number even accurate prove mask use causing low rate symptoms, entirely even partly, might take another separate peer reviewed article show that. Thirdly, assume number factory would 95% everywhere else, might take third peer reviewed article looking one location show that. name studies provide persuasive evidence masks causing increase proportion asymptomatic cases. actually identify study studies talking check claim, agree stated fact like that. wildlife less developed brains. try understand. born way. changed tho, placing ads disable Instagram far majority traffic 35+ yo. Even though ad target group starts 16 ends 50. Watch get shit Herd immunity may lead herd disability still know long immunity last.

Good number critics Swedish herd immunity strategy article grown 25. Live Transcribe google help this. see ID one fastest spreads disease country. told person guy lived 2 blocks buddies parents died it.  told person talking guy november, february vent. Guy 37, healthy. lived, rough.  know numbers are, seems like everyone wants debate right now. want get things too. person heavily anti mask, says everything hoax. share known facts know, dismissed random facebook stuff - get little angry. probably asymptomatic showed symptoms bouts coughing.

...Wat? Wow, almost death rate thing matters people treat seriously beginning published ad self made masks never got approved quality control, later happy take hundreds dollars advertising masks yesterday banned account completely without information.

Fuck site 100%. Yes.

You also see common type ""radiation"" damage : sunburn.

In case best hide muh bootstraps /s

&amp;#x200B;

there enough boots, enough straps, much ask rich give scraps?  Living already painful, twist! Oh guy looks like Trump's evil brother. Yeah things help, still social distance, wear masks etc. bad stuff ""second wave"" came fall. think people would like volunteer get redemption failures managing this. think that's really - actually people know trust (in real life), they'd get information without Facebook. No, believe main issue hundreds, sometimes thousands 'friends' people add good reason (maybe show popular are), easy share (with click) something spread throughout social circles consisting thousands. articles memes could shared smaller group actual friends, misinformation spread like wildfire. trace anyone. GDPR Ireland.  Texas space, heat, sun, things supposed stem spread.

This going get much worse cooler months come. Time running out. ""first wave"" never really impacted people Idaho decided never anything worry about. wave coming one believes therefore one wears masks social distances. cases percentage fastest rising nation followed Florida. Makes sad state love. Almost like media wants get panicked stuff doesnt even care it. understand concern handing location information government bad idea. install app code secret.

But open source. Irish I'd immediately install it. Now, people understand code refuse believe experts saying safe. no, work US. Diabetes always obvious. Diabetes go undiagnosed long time friend. nice see people complain poor, horribly run countries getting bailed rich, well managed countries. Facebook account got suddenly banned yesterday, wonder connected somehow. business account zero Facebook activity, controlling 2 business pages zero interactions (just there), thing pumping $300+ dollar month ads business. made point cotton masks produce less waste.

PS: usually use Facebook anything, says checked already way get back. literally business only, imagine would used Facebook login somewhere, would promoted Facebook pages. Buy high, sell low wolf wall street you! Im self conscious get social anxiety, wearing masks great lmao.  Zuckerberg's precious freedoms? think attitude skip mourning loss much life many wonderful people bad consequences. Without mourning, hard appreciate wonderfulness, preciousness, shortness life. it, devaluing life itself, part it. personal psychological effects, painful feelings cut off, high danger cut connection yourself, feel less alive consequence. That's like recipe depression.

Imagine pet love, dies, put trash act nothing happened.

Then, mourning gives people sense community really really need it. Take away, wonder feel totally left alone. *are* left alone.

And finally, think bad collective effects well. 9/11 attack great loss American people. horrified next day, dead even named, went war. Would better hold moment reconize pain? think Norway (after Breivik attack) New Zealand (after Christchurch massacre) much better way allowed reconnect life, value cherish it, many tears, human living beings. worry, soon number drop 0 true hero  need GOP shame bell lady. complete idiot lmao. People worked home, though.  ""I know fire started. always careful, except campfire guestroom"" Religion dummies  agree this. example, internet PC growing up, used schools computer lab library work. Obviously, anyone similar position pandemic would hard pressed work. like scenario with, pay rent buy food? risk (or child's) health my/their academic future? Nice haha *coughs*

and schools He's going 1 day per week. numbers err side caution, explain weighted never underreport important disease control. 


I think raw excess deaths interesting dip negative wave, see raw figures cools way political right now. would say studies nature obscure average netizen. Even doctors felt uncertain scientific results concerning masks. problem exist America though. People tried avoid misinformation stick governments recommendation ironically forced spread government-issued misinformation.  'Assisting Kim money' misleading.

but bribe N.Koreans pave way Inter Korean Summit, improved relations bit. Let guess. area hit bad. Laughs Atheism! China 2 months ago.  like leave lol /s like antivaxxers steroids. they'll believe Facebook trying silence ""truth."" sad many think people dying OK wear freaking mask... PROTEST. life America dispensable? sad. There've studies posted sub since March showing masks, even cloth masks, obviously helpful. People want stupid research stuff thats obvious. think expectation especially high service industries one wants customers know employee sick.

As someone works restaurants. Theres good chance theres someone sick handling food matter go. usually get rest staff sick too. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah swede apparent ever. Live Boston, can’t remember last time saw someone without mask inside. people wear outside well. Take worst parts vacationing make whole vacation. That’s cruises always seemed like me. Oh definitely meant mandatory case ignorance, stupidity, defiance general population. hate selfish country is. Exponential functions form a\*b^x starting number (here 20), b growth factor (here 2) x case time variable. function describing /u/hyperfocus_ example would 20\*2^x resulting 20, 40, 80, .., 1280 x = 0, 1, 2, .., 6. people say Sweden badly, compare well Norway did.

Norway 47 deaths per million 5.3 million people.

~~Texas 3 deaths per million 29 million people.~~

Texas 140 deaths per million 29 million people. think it’s exaggerated worry even covid local ER always full. Last times hallway. admitted still stay ER room hospital rooms upstairs full agree more. child daycare option right now. lucky relative, trust, watch child wife work home. Even then, person watch kid 20 hours week, leaving wife divide remaining 20 (minimum - try 50 hours week work). simply could without help barely working. option, would quit job watch kid. options. single parent help all, would devastated. take risk losing job risk child's welfare? know answer might seem obvious us, I'm convinced that's easy decision someone already struggling pandemic. needs assistance somekind. Agree. preschooler (3.5) taken mask wearing surprising ease. decision hard enough without making masks bogeyman. source that? economically opposite true hundred years now. Masks mandatory trains weeks. I've train twice since required, times half people wearing them. passengers drunk though, could explain it. No. Americans weaponizing freedoms themselves. Nobody planet anything gain Americans continuously ruining public health economy.

Not even freakin' Chicoms rule rests premise make people wealthy, harder US demand tanking.

Btw Americans stop ascribing mistakes others. across pond narrative seems childish remain polite. rebellions based hope! /r/accidentallystarwars Thank public health officials making masks law creates tension way politicisation does, want appeal better nature.

I think argue wear masks pandemic spreads less quicker, need accept 5-10 % population weak wear mask need help them, possibly arranging shopping them.

There certain amount machismo wearing mask would like reverse it. addressed here. Even public transport bus drivers try enforce rules ignored. nurse risk girlfriend can't think long tbh. plan teach virtually. That’s acceptable option Yes also spreads people symptoms.. people stay home You’re retarded. 

Phase 2 recombinant anthrax vaccine complete 2003. You’re right! Let’s make sure spread important message around world!   Ronald DeathSentence muh freedomz. First time long time cases lower day last week. Hoping trend continue even though i'm afraid regarding viral load potential impact severity, fairly obvious epidemiology studies? people living households multiple people significant impact severity illness? live alone catch community far likely far less exposure catching family member, especially intimate partner? 2500 deaths day America, making covid deadliest thing America.

Was back sending infected seniors care homes causing huge outbreaks enclosed areas full vulnerable people? What?

In Belgium everyone wears mask store, honest wear street well.
Quite honestly wouldn’t feel safe talking anyone without atm. um...it's going magically disappear one day? actually something? feel lied to. Especially since golden. confuse weight-lifiting/ healthy exercise bodybuilding. Bodybuilding nothing health, image. result, extremely taxing heart, severely limits mobility participants typically go periods dehydration starvation ""look best"". amazing survived. Also, lots people don’t give fuck wearing masks keeping socially distant, especially SoCal. 

Where I’m Oakland it’s always mask-less covid fest lake since March.   $350,000 top another $350,000 restitution, sure.  coworker bought house last December.

Another currently going nasty divorce.

A third who’s wife lost job COVID trying keep entire household 5 afloat single teachers’ salary.

All people already entire lives turned upside even suggesting stop working gamble.

I understand sentiment agitating much feel like get away without raising many alarm bells also recognize relatively insulated survive months income even afford move stripped license. speak gambling others lives suggestion isn’t fucking thing fellow teachers. ever tried organize general strike short notice region next workers’ protection? first step organizing promoting empathy solidarity. opposite that. Fucking stop. fucking add dig referring China Virus. Fucking asshole. It’s meant reduce taxes rich. It’s dumb it’s targeting needs it. DeSantis, Kemp, Abbott murderers eyes. knew needed save lives constituents, chose opposite. Idiots thinking basketballs ain’t never bounced rim everyone knows it’s nothing net brick backboard since b-ball smaller hoop. Honestly get vaccine mid Octoberish lot public forget rotten Trump this. penis page complete transcript idk wtf guy talking about. Maybe added page published?

Anyway, two distinct claims title:

1. Masks limit exposure, limits severity symptoms
2. 95% people get infected asymptomatic areas close 100% mask usage

Claim Right. said, they're beneficial protect others shed high rates nose mouth even feel fine. kind party line while. really protective individual. sort putting together, really less virus get in, less sick likely be. masks protect - we've seen getting virus altogether. that's seen hamster studies. That's seen health care worker study published last week JAMA. get virus in, get little in. likely get what's called asymptomatic infection symptoms - mild infection. really based fact we've known many years - probably hundred - virus get system, likely get sick. masks protect you.

Claim want wearing mask get bad stuff virus cause severe illness. And, yes, we've absolutely seen countries even settings outbreaks everyone masked, there's, like, 95% rate symptoms all. actually outbreak chicken factory, outbreak seafood factory country. everyone masking. 95% asymptomatic rate infection.

So far tell, title accurate, what's said true. sure there's ""misleading title"" tag honest. Ok bit scary. think ok wore mask asymptomatic ... Y'all realize 700,000 people die year us already? would mourning day eternity payed attention time. stance genders never equal thus women trash men manly men won’t give fuck they’re men. Although say doesn’t mean women exempt trashed, care more. Rick Scott awful governor, yet he's senator.

People vote r matter what. guarantee would think differently personally affected civil wars around world today.  Vote Nicole Gallaway! God, website terrible mobile. are. resource tap turned ""unlimited"" though, happened here.  Well obviously write that. literacy great. that's saying much here, 🤷 much tell really. sub know worth noting 455 deaths reported last 24 hrs represent people got infected time ago (a week, two weeks, month ago?)... 60 - 70k new case per day trend, well I'm sure started, recently believe, cases progress toward either recovery death unfortunate prediction see many, many deaths per day seeing now. NYC surrounding counties twice number deaths per day peak NY epidemic. Granted NY's governor made decisions likely caused increase deaths, think outlook country good time.

So many areas country shut community spread, whether fear political reasons, shut early. also worth noting areas know needed shut testing. course, seems areas opened haphazard manner haste. 

Not PC anaolgy, brought blind deaf friend beach, told walk surf try get hit wave, analogy dives come get hit. Believe me, blaming you. pointing out.  Thanks! 🤣❤️   Good difference make do..? them. adults supposed responsible ones. least around here...i'm sure works florida. HATE GOVERNOR PARSON least stores taking action mask mandated states, counties cities! nice see states like Arkansas, Alabama, Texas getting mask train. Meanwhile know Iowa never -- governor never even issued stay home orders even think recommends masks worn. Except *is* way get high school season back. Make special considerations graduating seniors extraordinary, lifetime circumstances let come back fall season graduate (unless go play college year, entirely feasible anyone who's considered college ball begin likely highlights sophomore junior years scouts consider).

It much doable. takes cutting red tape says ""not high school, player"" one single year season. kids be, most, 19, hardly going make difference terms athletic ability advantage field, especially every school it. Would dangerous obese students 100 degree weather. American kids obese average countries. 

Not sure assigned positive negative value comment. That’s you. Downvoted get 69.   ""Collectively, findings support hypothesis COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive innate immunity."" Easiest way put it, hypothesize covid 19 basically airborne HIV/AIDS Wanna see??! ...owo??  Lol 6 months lockdown. guys even single month proper lockdown besides northeast states [Here Yes, 5G. /s feds States run border pot still much illegal federal level USA. would think viral load plays it. sick living space constantly adding viral load everyone else.  Gonna hit 4 million cases tomorrow. Who’s ready?! know many ways say this.

The post learned viral load correlates symptom severity - since masks limit viral load there's yet another reason wear masks.

The guy's response pretty big piece news is: ""No shit, put filter air breathe, it’s gonna limit toxic elements breathe in."" 

There's nothing ""no shit"" this. researched. There's nothing inherently intuitive viral load correlating symptom severity mention connection - connection that's TITLE POST.

It seemed like missed point, (as guy started arguing realized wrong nuked comments) pointed ""no shit"" comment capturing ACTUAL news is. SAR government still charge pandemic prevention day. long SAR government exist level independence One Country Two Systems still effect.

We've this. managing pandemic enough separate political entity, US state political upto Beijing Hong Kong would lockdown long time now. look quickly Xinjiang went war time management.

Beijing send Xinjiang ""war time management"", Xinjiang government it.

Provinces still calling shots within least extent. Idahoan here, everyone either making political statement wearing masks pretending like pandemic. Corporations loosely enforcing mask mandates. Parks public swimming areas packed noone wearing masks. 

Can't wait another mandatory stay home order. DONT WANT YOU, EH Honestly, kinda gross even publicize sub (not blaming you, hope people see get sucked cult) I'm fun him. He's definitely spectrum. read he's saying. goes beyond youth.  basically workplace testing- many workplaces Use search Twitter: *from:realdonaldtrump favorite president*

Enjoy! Please let know enjoy trip.

Edit: OH GOD, sometimes writes “your favorite president (me)” case people need clarification.  ELI...15?:

Viruses replicate fairly standard rate.

Let's say double every day.

The body takes figure response attack. Let's say week.

Let's take two scenarios. One 10 'virus particles', one 1000.

Day 1-7 (start counterattack)

10 'virus particles': 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640

1000 'virus particles': 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16,000, 32,000, 64,000

Which one looks easier beat?

The immune system also production facility. pretend know its' production scaling ramp, must exist, must finite. far know, cannot commandeer every cell body like virus can. second scenario, must counterattack minimum capability taking 64,000 virus cells per day stand still.

There tipping point immune system simply cannot produce enough get ahead virus' production rate.

The longer immune system takes figure out, behind be. 

So probably best limit initial dose.

On that, speculated vaccine remains elusive, poorer parts world might turn twist ancient smallpox prevention: variolation. might reduce damage/deaths tiny measured dose live virus deliberately given otherwise healthy people. principle immune system get ahead tiny dose much consistently random dosing present. Ethical? thought America, highest bidder wins. They’ll call bullshit today, year there’s vaccine available they’ll point study evidence support antivaxxing, “I made sure Xennia played Hadley hour get micro-dose Covid!” really believe start inoculating low-risk persons 'small viral loads.' 600 nothing. barely covers monthly groceries. Essentially yes, like premise vaccines work, uncontrolled uncontrollable setting (and given modern vaccines use live active virus). incredibly skeptical conclusion. Pathogen dose important, typically think threshold - reach threshold likely develop infection. reason probably doesn’t matter 1000 100,000 virions infect difference dose VASTLY OVERCOME within several generations exponential growth infections occur. haven’t seen rigorous science establishes mechanism — npr podcast science. buddy’s troll lmao comments sound like 12 year old would write sound smart SAD! refuse work, wouldn’t eligible unemployment see opposite well. clue many FLORIDA, Idaho, Oregon plates driving around Washington state right now...  mix slowly poisoned get accustomed misinformation telling notice anything ""off"" nothing fine. 

Quite seriously, beginning clear consistent messaging government, Republican party, Fox (and associated) news things would different. There's constant feeding reseeding misinformation that's coming people motivations. hoping strong short term economy, contentious election year, simply wishing destabilize country. America history divisiveness, makes people susceptible influence. fact ""on ground"" situation changes dramatically makes obvious. can't tell many times mutter words ""fucking idiot"" days. American, would support trade halt US gets shit control. travel ban Europe anything get people take seriously, maybe affects supply chain. Like someone said above, global embarrassment, countries every right avoid us government starts taking seriously. wonder many belonging group live Arizona Here’s thing. audience needs hear reactionary NPR. Every brand anything binary days. Thats fucking problem god dammit. 

I’m drunk sorry. underused word America. Everyone drops c bomb uk 😂 Yes sir, well lived outskirts town one grocery store gas station. Either way, closest grocery 20 miles away next 50. Yeah, think fine little selfish long also acknowledge serious COVID right thing. winter want escape sunshine I'm going place live eliminated virus (they already once) We'll see. Animals dangerous they're hungry scared. Especially human animal. make good point. Like said perfect figure provide care kids essential workers think would easier accomplish many children possible kept home. claim answers, I'm frustrated little done trying think something ...is bullshit? actually say this, fake? fair, he’s asymptomatic Claim unemployment, especially covid related payments extended. teachers refuse person learning, really think would say “oof, school”? No. would discussion, hopefully eventual result would online learning. get paid again. We'll figure eventually.... *sigh* fucking hope. stupidity? arrogance flavor stupidity? woman routinely take mask order food finally two cops came asked many times told wear mask. cited outside store husband return. odd. mask hand. Like, that's effort wanted put probably thought horse pony show. Yeah, maybe stupidity. even stupid people know better. late 90s, also exhaled cardboard paper towel tube stuffed dryer sheets. room smelled like cigarettes, pot, fresh linen. Yeah crazy lucky we'd way vaccines made future. could revolutionary types treatments I'd imagine too. (Thinking immunotherapy) age three, Miseda diagnosed sickle cell anemia.   
   daughter could get severely sick COVID-19, mom Vicky Oduk said taken safety measures seriously, leaving home food believes contracted virus work.   
   got infected came back home infected children,” Oduk said tears.
  Miseda's condition began deteriorate hospital, said agreed receive remdesivir, trial drug showing promise days first treatment, Miseda says showed rapid improvement discharged 10 days admitted. viruses work. takes time replicate anything, immune system kill then, stop getting much damage.

Just think - produces virus faster - one cell virus replicating, 10,000 cells virus replicating? I’m here. lot seemed “save N95s surgical masks frontline workers need them.” local community, lot anti-maskers share “meta study” UMN think gets you’re saying early reports coming conflicting wearing mask. I’ll always wear mask, decent amount articles reputable sources saying they’re helpful think. I’m means endorsing article, I’ve seen numerous articles contrary. putting people see conflicting information efficacy masks. [""China study: asymptomatics lower virus hired horse watch dog? also way tests administered country. population pretty high here. 

There eliminated corona bud. always gonna here. likelihood 0 corona World slim none. 

Fact life go one even lock downs statistically werent effected. 

Plus cdc, who, several researchers show us data mask effectiveness mixed. rIghTs!?

/s melt like snowflakes are. Genki Sudo! Actually hear every day states ""about overwhelmed"". I'll sending good vibes towards hospitality workers deal public freakouts coming way. Please make sure secretly record everyone entertainment. Kayfabe news outside squaredcircle? God damn brother huge fantasy. absolutely right understand what's line. guess I'm trying say could see working somehow teachers went strike time. West Virginia successful couple years ago, middle school year know pay stopped not. Texas likely see ~150 deaths per day avg week grow two weeks coming one. Yes, never know what’s going happen next!   Paycheck paycheck folks still waste money. know, there, too. can't imagine way save $300 trolling me. media always bit behind curve tend tone things bit.

Sorry. made spit milk there. Northeast investor, Fidelity, finds making stupid GOP driven decisions hurt business... call overrule Jacksonville idiots. Good, friend got suspended calling anti-maskers there's def mutual fuckery somewhere pipeline.  would drag Tequila vaginas names mud like that? unfair comparison. /s sub people seem harder time recognizing sarcasm subs. Honestly, it’s well established enough point wear mask. could tell people, god promised million dollars cover stupid fucking face, still wouldn’t it. 20000 samples. Random sampling across 11 district Delhi It’s almost like police preoccupied something Never happened yet moment see person mask store supermarket, call security guard police. see cheap free Craigslist area. watched happen like slow moving train wreck. Yeah almost like news stories telling us hospitals ""about overwhelmed"" soooo many places ...

.. never actually see articles actually happening.  shall use insult month Well said horrible part loud *he better fucking hope so* publish picture sick kid hooked machines, MO parents rightfully riot. 

Also it’s *Lord Flies*, remember lots older adults helping us school. 110k 11:24 care people dying, infected, post social media say bad, set gofundme page. Isnt right?  Kids get Covid dont problems it. merely help protect merely help protect weather
misleading title    won’t worry enough population taking vaccine successful?

I heartily pro vaccinations, flu shot last week...

But funny news (not necessarily viruses) seems come distract us things key times.

Edit.. stock market particular moment needs propped either good news multi trillion dollar US war chest . compared *seven days ago* See relativism Yes. 'Assisting Kim money' implies North Korea sympathizer treasonously gave money Kims prosper. case here. President Roh's Sunshine Policy required inter Korean summit. summit led warmer relations two Koreas, corporations Hyundai factories N.K. paid N.K. workers cheap labor. win-win situation. relations broke 2008. Life full surprises. Covid brand new virus, know hard going make vaccine tried. SARS1, scientists tried first vaccine candidates animals, suffered massive allergic reactions. Covid, animal studies vaccine candidates went smoothly. far looks like got lucky, Covid like SARS1 might even started phase 1 human trials point. Better analogy take test without paying attention class homework, thinking hour studying night work.  said OVERALL vague 'many case Covid transmission via cash?

Republicans win presidential election, democrats lost. agree misfortunate anti science agenda going country, think related right. used way, right wing conservatives fighting facts, fit agenda. see sides this.

You need revolution evolution. left America get back political centre radical left, that's way actually change thing. left continue radicalise, next republican nominee sensible trump, political centre would therefore move right, left going radical ones, end years ago. adult person, think like one. Watching shitshow Europe funny first, disturbing. track idiots keep running states. Yeah. Please msg die..please. That’s offensive.... rocks Welp.

Mostly Samsung engineers managers South Korean companies investing Vietnam. 50% Samsung phones produced Vietnam. Doubtful since people wear masks people get vaccinated. There's app now, understand. said "" CONGRATS NEW DOUBLE WIDE"" put reading glasses grandpa. Suggesting Trump isn’t evil brother? I'm curious worth! nice see someone put money mouth is. think assured. 

Literally everyone either nasty medical bill, personally know someone nasty medical bill.

I believe combined unite people changing system. People like need understand they're untouchable, things say consequences. balance power country, opinion, gone unchecked long enough. Back January?

2. forced care end hospital. don’t die immediately lol.  come funeral dressed like that! took 4 months 140 THOUSAND deaths... counting. Guaranteed morons still say masks don’t help.

When there's 3 4 million normal fucking day. Nah COVID joke Hahahahah!

I laughing keep crying. baseball, generally would touch ball team touching. team touching bat. give ump sanitizing wipes wipe bat down. OG SARS basically mutate existence? IIRC got *deadlier* stopped spreading.

Too deadly quickly = no/low spread.

Not deadly enough, quick symptoms = spread.

Delayed symptoms, deadly = let bodies hit floor (ft. Ebola).

Delayed symptoms, high proportion asymptomatic carriers, etc. = wildfire. adorable :) Extreme stories get reported often. Meanwhile, Florida... Ive stocking too. think wise choice room would to. Lol began reopening what? exactly 6 days things reopened masks social distancing place protests.

Before reopening limited. Much limited states referenced here. it’s still locked degree now. Tho it’s summer CA plenty people indoor dining bars still closed. they’ll get feelings hurt Hong Kong reported 73 cases today. total 84. live small city, thousands Highly paid renters left gone home, probably return, remote working becoming standard, home renters already suffering, prices rentals dropping fast, mortgage payments already starting affected know banks rather prone attack lender wounded... also lots office space become free many companies realizing ease workers remote working home financially profitable.... fun times head. 

&amp;#x200B;

A *housing bubble* run-up home *prices* fueled demand, speculation, exuberance, bursts demand falls supply ... seems pretty accurate description today. Viral load much virus system. Infectious dose better term much hit got infected. infected somebody six feet &amp; cough:

Neither wearing mask: got shot .44 magnum. You’re wearing mask they’re not: got shot .22. They’re wearing mask you’re not: got shot pellet rifle. 
Both wearing mask: got hit paintball. Hoax = “I don’t wrestle difficult decisions sort fact fiction.” It’s self-centered laziness. That's gonna cheap fair, make minimum wage would qualify Medicaid, far better health insurance cheapest private plans. Unless they’re state hasn’t expanded it, they’re screwed. Okay, poor wording part. know different virus, thats meant. need pedantic. Edited initial post Yeah, worrying kids asthma allergies stupid

/s alone Thanks :) Turns science backs common sense. people start wearing now? Probably 🤦‍♂️ good choices here. Houston I’m surprised feel safe going back classroom. HISD horribly mismanaged financially years probably can’t afford take appropriate steps protecting students teachers. actually going happen media reporting thing 2 weeks like they're Texas? Yeah...

My concern may go crazy long weekends coming up. help government-run domestic travel campaign GOTO encouraging cross-prefecture travel summer (exception Tokyo). must read much comment history believe that. find people like hilarious. made night. brief scan finds nothing earth shatteringly new: mostly insufficient evidence transmission risks, research urgently needed, schools must carefully weigh costs/benefits entire community re-opening, staffing shortages likely real problem. 

Haven't gotten recommended mitigation meaures yet. expecting eureka. I've heard flip held true. Idk idc anymore. truly know governments stepped bounds hell pay concern: pandemic coupled government that's rapidly spiraling control. appears perfect storm, unless settles quickly, unlikely good ending. It’s anglophobia lmao Unless violation safety regulation mandate. 

I care unemployment used relying myself. want die $11 hour boss believes radio commentators pastors instead scientists doctors.  lot PSAs shitting ICU beds. Nobody photo ever got C grade school science women flaming men always “punching up” punching always fine Ahhh, okay, Im saying folks r/nba saying, obvi wrong— thank goodness

*I edited post  Redose coming years I’m paid subscriber podcast, listen almost every show, must missed one. 

I say stance early masks evidence seems show slows transmission, recent shows says evidence showing covid airborne transmission droplet, means masks might effective originally thought, still wear mask it’s better error side caution.

Districts weigh relative health risks reopening educational risks

learning development, districts prioritize reopening emphasis providing 
full-time, in-person instruction grades K-5 students special needs would 
best served in-person instruction. 

Recommendation 2: Precautions Reopening
To reopen pandemic, schools districts provide surgical masks 
teachers staff, well supplies effective hand hygiene people enter school 
buildings. 
...

Recommendation 8: High-Priority Mitigation Strategies
Based currently known spread COVID-19, districts prioritize 
mask wearing, providing healthy hand hygiene solutions, physical distancing, limiting large 
gatherings. Cleaning, ventilation, air filtration also important, attending 
strategies alone sufficiently lower risk transmission. Creating small cohorts 
students another promising strategy.” Oh...it live. Pretty much every survey done mask usage, higher percentage women report using masks. Karen meme obfuscates bit. general, women likely wear masks adhere public hygiene measures (like hand-washing).

And anecdotally, seen videos men violently expressing displeasure wear masks... Working it. Even pandemic over, I'll bitter handle things.

It's tough situation. would hope state handle things correctly...but haven't.

It's really hard get people make correct, responsible decisions.

In sense, democracy/capitalism seem work this. But, work economics.  half Covid-19 patients showed degree rather severe heart injury scan study made recently. That's terrifying. I'd like know difference large viral load vs. small viral load terms number individual bugaboos. live RivCo. huge number people commute LA half believe COVID's hoax.

But better months.

If helps people get masks, good. know that, something already went Moon. Yes, need something Mars, article said means we’re sure going released. 

It doesn’t. 28/50 = 56%

So five months we've achieved middling F, hurray. I'm proud customer. also donated PPE start IIRC.

As tall woman, they're one places find clothing size. Gotta support stay business. already lost Long Tall Sally Covid. Yes. It’s Trump choice. tell timeline odds reality. number low testing really  really strange confused want keep conversation solely focused people impoverished *before* COVID facing homelessness.

No.

I'm saying talk homelessness, talk exclusively homelessness.

When talk unemployment, loss wealth, etc. would appropriate talk landlords perspective.

Do realize homelessness literally lack housing? need redefine word include housed people. definition already exists. Somehow continue faith current ~~society's~~ community's ability power blizzard shame next president elected.

Edit - *community* better word *society*, personal context somehow go regions UK well

Why it? UK something great think British people proud. would argue happened Scotland, though know others may not. We're British, beef Scottish, Welsh Irish brothers sisters, Tories. breakdown case is, important. test positive, 5% moderate severely affected covid. Hospital admissions continue go well.. people scared go hospital stay. want avoid go home quick possible. Especially they’re allowing family members access. Winn Dixie near closed year ago, avoid it. think Evers waiting Kelly longer supreme court. less likely another ruling like stay home order. That's guess anyway. There's financial apocalypse heading US soon. obviously affect entire globe felt generations. I’m telling happened roommate. don’t really need believe me, offering experience. 

You choose believe, respond “filthy liars filth, etc.”, lose credibility come immature. 

People can’t accept experiences contradict opinion smallest minded folks.  I’m eyeing Canada, UK , Mexico said, sucks come warning even 0.02% kids die corona, still 14,000 kids one year.

It called risk assessment.

At age, COVID 19 even top 10 things likely kill young people given year. 

Car crashes kill young people one day COVID 19 one month nobody banning cars. It’s long contract tracing work. get result 10 days, probably takes 2-3 days reach you. they’re going try get remember contacts 2-4 weeks ago. There’s way someone going remember accurately particularly sick anxiety positive test. tracers run exact problem every contact remember.

The test 2-3 day turnaround testing tracing going work. Funny, Democrats act way notion voting Republican. think Trump's really going think long term through? US?

We baseball starting 3 days. Like said, one inherently safest since players generally far apart. But, traveling around country, unlike sports like NBA NHL planning. Canada banned Canadian team (Toronto) playing games there, they’ll playing Buffalo Florida. 

The NBA (basketball) starting July 30th. They’r whole rest season “bubble” Orlando, players living playing campus food provided league. It’s strict, player walked outside boundary pick food delivery got slapped 7 day mandatory quarantine hotel room. 

I know NHL planning playoffs “hub cities”, don’t follow closely. 

NFL (football) freewheeling haven’t really demonstrated kind COVID control, banning fans preseason camps. teams banned fans upcoming regular season games, few. first regular season game still 7 weeks away. way, NFL far dangerous.. teams HUGE, staff, players, rather impossible make bubbles like attempt NBA. Plus BMI many players puts many higher risk well.
**I love NBA MLB way**

Housed landlords housed. 

People getting evicted not. 

I'm saying separate conversations classify address needs both. 

You realize housed landlord, statement quoted, category homeless person, right?

One housing. doesn't.

This really simple concept.

Do understand homelessness people lack housing? shouldn’t. US bet 1.2 billion it. seven chosen candidates got fraction that. quoted timelines election. Trump Oxford Vaccine. hunch got much money promised earlier delivery. timelines don’t add AstraZeneca execs never said September/October speaking publicly. say December/January. Dr John Ioannidis

There's bunch fascinating subs like this. r/NoNewNormal entertaining people. forget, everyone thinks they're experts coronaviruses Rubbish, vaccine research well funded governments effective. Companies also make plenty money many many decades everyone needs them.

There HIV vaccine able make one (mutates much attacks immune system). 

Most coronaviruses generate systemic immune response (localised upper respiratory system general) mechanisms long term immunity activated. one quite different respect.

For SARS terminate work vaccine people test on.  bad New York Europe. fact, USA densely packed full people reached point yet *really* bad. close areas, move patients less impacted areas sufficient surge capacity/areas might get really bad. Again, tens thousands people die, happen strange circumstances, statistically speaking.

You answer question though. someone passes covid motorcycle dies. cause death virus, crash? expect civility towards 'that'?
Thats like saying must civil Hitler.
You know right? can't count many people I've seen *take mask talk* NE Ohio. wear nose.

Stopped wearing stuffy R95 vent started wearing half mask P95 valve again. I'm safe before, comfortable, dangerous tools ""wearing"" mask. yelling ""Wintness me!!!"" bestest. Terrific numbers. mediocre ones bad honesty, like *need* go Imperial Cambridge. worked Winn-Dixie (aka Win-Dick-Me—among employees) years, I'm one bit surprised.

Ironically biggest assets young labor pool population upsides. would arguably much disastrous countries sustained shutdown due control virus US Look yellow dots. Ughhh. makes want fucking puke. Why? Outdoor gatherings protests, sports concerts perfectly fine long people wear masks. 

Protests lead massive spike (even tho social distance) therefore safe resume sports concerts. Pigglys requiring masks. Texas thought otherwise. I'm personally boat can't wear mask, going out. all, breathing issues now, covid gonna suck big time you. fuck about? No, USA threatening UK invasion wait months vaccine even came that. would likely shared regardless frontline workers risk across West, essentially every country sick depraved are, apparently. squabble gets average citizens first. Probably goes highest bidder ones made initial investments, USA would amongst likely anyways. need threaten invasion vaccines simply outbid rest world (far less pricey UK/EU vs USA war... That's sure, sides involved...)

What weird comment. Like thinking basically goes, ""Ah fuck guys helping us save old people case we're going start WW3 kill millions young poor people order save 100 thousand old people. waste trillions dollars destroy decades partnership too!"" Get grip.  turned television radio, read paper caught surprise.

Do people know 'really really infectious' means?  That’s illegal. Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords discriminating tenants based family status. Interesting end meaningless several million people need hunt starve.. I'm sure seems calculated actually. us crave sense normalcy, even hope return normalcy. Pro sports contained way project that. grand scheme things, contained group people playing sport, without spectators, pretty reasonable. risk, reasonable risk, guys agreeing to. withdrawing, far know, besides giving salary, negative reprecussions, great. I'm sure MLB's plans are, NHL example, going play playoffs two cities Canada, pretty responsible. Fauci going throwing first pitch, endorsement there's hope normalcy.

Yes flip side, I'm told he's super CCP friendly DPRK friendly.

So friendly new spy chief apparently someone previously charged corruption assisting Kim dictator money. 

And he's apparently anti refugee DPRK

Someone knowledge hopefully chime in. President temper tantrum going happy all. Point direction referring ""your favorite President!"" frequently. So, less virus exposure = asymptomatic

more viral exposure = bad things happen

I guess makes sense we've seen, know people hypothesized before.

5 days ago Oklahoma broke 1000 club, last two days 1/5th that. Hope get numbers corrected two days basically saying either a) go cities

B) things come cities

C) cities come (megachurches).

So deduce city dwellers issue rural towns? worry. CoVID leaving lot people chronic symptoms, still lots doctors/nurses needed. plead incompetant politicians implement stay home orders find way pay smaller businesses people lockdown without going broke destroying businesses. *scratches head 

And worried headlice. Please keep mind non-respirator masks (N95) meant protect you. Procedural (surgical) masks say bold letters manufacturer packaging. Surgeons surgery techs wear masks keep getting sick. 

They help keep spreading germs way way better help getting them.

Sucks nothing happens, much. Biggest one retirement many went ahead it. Scaling could countries, sadly drug prices America politics economics. Also, price main factor, viable scale process. Monoclonal antibodies since much larger complicated molecule, much harder scale up. 

Also, vaccines train body heavy lifting, monoclonal bodies really that. probably going need much larger dose monoclonal antibodies means production resources needed treat one person. Yeah, sounds like straining past boundaries control, 500 known clusters imagine quite unknown brewing. called ""force multipliers"" - keeping people alive means care sick people individual healthcare worker helps many many patients hopefully survive.

And so, allowed virus spread exponentially. Obviously hindsight 2030 knows much virus could’ve contained early das lied effectiveness masks.

Pretty reasonable. need anti-rejection medications suppress immune system rest life think time career change.  Eh way easier contact trace less populated downstate counties - tests coming back quickly, like 3 hours 2 days depending urgency. problem downstate phase 4.

I think Illinois got wrecked first wave much like New York, experience NYC tragedy - never happened Chicago. press really cover Illinois wave due going NYC. 

My county example, Kane, 500,000 people. epicurve county looks lot like epicurve New York, Sweden, UK. Basically looks like virus infected substantial number people (10-15%, perhaps 20%) trailed baseline.

Ultimately virus spread downstate counties hit nearly hard yet, happen much, much slower population density. 99.99% people ever lived well human history. Even greatest people ever lived even come close level impact curing worldwide pandemic has. isn’t true all. That’s like saying get little HIV virus won’t get AIDS. WOOOOOOOOOOO! Theoreticaly possible, like lottery win. truly contact one person quite easy guess, Apps try give least amount information could possible user. 

It's mostly designed situations like supermarkets public transport, interact strangers. 🎶L💘O💘V🎶E initially number new deaths steadily declining since mid April. Nearly half deaths elderly homes sufficient protected. Elderly homes Sweden typically people can't take care usually couple years left live even without virus, virus gets place like it'll claim many lives.

It worth noting Sweden likely one countries accurate statistics COVID-19 deaths (as match excess mortality). I'm Denmark.. keep opening stuff(essentially, everything except large crowds) infections keep going down. literally two people ICU entire country. There's need mandate strict laws/rules there's need to?

Second wave, sure. Now? really make sense - difference. spending help fix problems financially weaker countries pay later, hopefully position net-positive contributor?  No. cops work. get detctive go make people follow law. get beat cops kind thing. Telling someone wear mask would interfere ability police jobs anymore writing parking citation. Sooo nothing new Chicago.... every business uses Linux. Although right, important learn. can’t take winning. first chart (“unlikely become overloaded”) refers *all* hospital beds, regular ICU. second link needed COVID patients) *only* ICU beds.

It's subreddit screaming deaths 3 months ago, screams cases. people frequent sub interested information used cause panic. Well, there's bit truth it. virus certainly bad, means nothing terms bigger picture, 78 million births 32 million deaths far year.

Someone dies able ask questions his/her behalf, that's ask questions behalf people can't. Yeah, think applying common sense really sketchy. I've understood non-virologist virus multiplies exponentially sick person's body find pretty unlikely immune system even starts fend virus certain threshold infected cells (implied also infected people showing symptoms first days) really unclear dosage matter person get infected.

On hand understand virus fails multiply body dies instead person obviously get sick. though anything immune system scenario ever symptoms.

I'm saying article saying wrong like said think probably apply common sense here. there's new law goverment allocated resources enforce it.

Yep, that's sounds like fucktards make government. I’m glad elected leaders large parts Europe done years. comes Corona strategy. 
The goes economy, crime fighting, wars, public health, weapon policies, education, Healthcare, car manufacturing, diplomacy international politics, voting system, human rights... Well, think positive news allowed well.

Welcome America 2020 you! Thank you! family spanish speaking. Idk hitting latinx communities much. New Zealand still actively recruiting skilled labor pandemic.

New Zealand always depicted situation brain exchange. Long term effects vaccines rare, almost effects shown within first 3 months immunization, chance serious long term damage low gets lower every day passes since people getting shot ones 4 months point seen evidence long term impact Mods consistently said change rules even vast majority sub voted it.

Notice nearly every conversation political, enforce rules something personally disagree with. Selective enforcement oldest rule book. seem let slack lately though bot running amok. never signed IRL Kingdom Hearts defense, deaths per million significantly lower New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts.

... wow, real? article fear. guess thought stressed enough COVID, they'd try make us fearful illness literally handful cases every year. found one wild! [one  figure vaccine begins distribution, it'll slow, steady return business usual. 

For first months, think - masks, distancing, limited indoor capacity various venues. 

Then science data hopefully show marked decreases infections deaths, we'll see new phased rolling normal life. 50% capacity turns 75%. Things like that. 

Barring major upticks infection/death rates, it'll gradual lightening restrictions. 

Finally, masks lifted various players within private sector mask laws exist. 

Then, situation improves, mask restrictions stricter states lifted except among vulnerable populations (nursing homes, hospitals, etc).

Then, improvement, we'll pretty much see masks worn vulnerable themselves, live vulnerable individuals (like cannot receive vaccine). 

It'll slow, right - 6-12 months probably solid guideline. imagine transition gradual much like many last 4 months transitioned staying put home carefully planning trips store outdoor restaurants even though people nearby. 

I think 2021 end lot relief, come sooner that. France done things mostly right, too. ever start open up, comes back. isn’t going away vaccine. Thank you. path virus must take reach complex and/or long, likely run something else along way.  Even good masks perfect -- reduce amount virus gets through. ""reduce"" key.  exposure sufficiently reduced, catch disease. 

So, use best masks available, use correctly. Keep much distance can, keep consistently.  Run HEPA filter room, can. cannot obtain ""zero"" exposure, need to.  simple steps, easily reduce exposure beyond needed threshold. according 1point3acres aren't.

62921 last Monday vs 64788 today Pupils fully dilated, blood shows high levels trumpephetamine. Since transmission seems via larger droplets (spread mouth) opposed smaller aerosols would mean might lower chance spreading others protection getting (if breathe nose).

Clearly think much go another store, that? doctor know public policy?  Go treat somebody. Well seem trying hide fudge numbers, stats going realistic. thought places went bankrupt. use Initial Viral Load. I’m scientist logical lower Initial Viral Load, much virus enters body, slower replication better chance antibodies adapt infection progresses. 

I’m happy see might correct means disease manageable. could unite around science. worked arby's 3 years. best fucking feeling closing night Karen, drunk mother fucker comes thru drive thru demanding let order food!

Lets say never got food closed 11PM S-T, 12PM F-S working night. almost gurrentee nights(I lenient closers 3 had). see social media. Wuhan horrendous place I’ve seen whole pandemic. caught guard northern Italy New York Madrid weeks unmitigated transmission lockdowns. numbers match anywhere else world that.

Most China's cases came Hubei. impact par affected regions world similar population. What's also different outbreak drag without resolution many months unlike countries west.

And whether undercounting, would likely be. phenomenon that's happening across world especially height outbreak. Even good faith governments, simply impossible close tracking cases hospitals verge collapse test kits short supply. There's reason people saying cases also underestimated states looking excess deaths.

With said, wonder Chinese casualty statistics would satisfy you? Double make 170K? Multiply 10 makes top 10? Make 10 million willfully neglectful countries feel vindicated? Still way better nothing. Honestly lockdown depression getting lot less intense baseball starting week. long it’s safe it’s much needed escape. Turns Asian countries knew all. friends family everyone desperately trying point bad idea reopening schools PANDEMIC is. kind sad repeated again. billboards, TV commercials, radio major media outlets. reepeated leading states/nation (most important POTUS). 

This **common knowledge** now. Instead people confused mixed messages many didnt believe anything heard anymore. Pretty sure Mary Roach confirmed book Stiff.  i'm going ask spite myself.. effective? change mind? Also Honduras Costa Rica say supporters ""If support want see virus explode used politically, wear mask.""

It literally simplest thing could done beginning prevent spread help re-election chances.

Instead he's chosen hard path fueling pandemic relying probable voter suppression/intimidation along straight fascism get across finish line.

Stable genius folks. Sadly, I'm highly skeptical number deaths lowballed. Based stats average mortality specific areas vs mortality rates year. Lotta numbers skewed. Like Pneumonia death rates way higher be. coincidence Don’t trust death figures all! total baloney. Even Messiah fauci said so. know 20 years old?

The advanced mathematics world. literally courses havent taken.

And you. Lazy joke. Picking apples. Peasant. Basically slavery. pretty much black slave. Maybe thats youre MAGA racist. projection. Self hate modern slave. Politicising pandemic bad idea, would think anyone sense would see what's happening US come conclusion.

I hear BGI Group went Hong Kong setup PCR test lab help testing, HKers accusing ""stealing HK DNA"".  Viral load determined exposed it’s already replicating. person claiming mask gives less exposure (which does) thus means less severe symptoms. completely false. Viral load doesn’t correlate viral load. Thus exposure doesn’t correlate severity.

Again, see above. Well without football watch, god forbid people start educate explore world around them. binge watch latest tired reboot 80s show. surprise really, idiots UK went running Spain soon stupidly allowed back in.

All Influencers z list celebrities back spamming pictures social media great back Spain. *best* slow, controlled exposure one build antibodies? Masks sound good all-around.

Dont let cnn ( leftist news organization) play partisan career Howdy. found [this saying ""CDC estimates 40% people infected COVID-19 asymptomatic.""

Can link source info? uh huh, get Shrute Bucks Stanley Nickels? need kind simple pin ribbon thing indicates one “anti-Karen“. essential workers, thing like let know confront person wearing mask complying safety protocols, customers would back confrontation. I’m sure would work long-term, lot people would simply start wearing icons without actual convictions anything put kind situation, it’s certainly nice thought might help least fears workers might confronting patrons. Hero eu u.s. almost deaths. Getting less virus exposure doesn’t mean symptoms less severe.

See above. sorry, bootheel way closer Mississippi 484 miles Again, live Portland, Oregon. seen surge protests. According worldmeters are: 65789 last Monday vs 62879 today.  Champion reasonable things given circumstance though. people aren’t things ones denial reality. Great point. think that's valid concern next round hopefully answers. definitely work planned absolutely mistakes made responsible children.  Sure, demographic understand purpose benefit wearing mask now, baseball game going change anything? said another recent post Target Walmart things - sad also hopeful stores starting mandate masks, since US cannot get page it. state mandate masks big retailers do, think definitely helpful. wish stores would ASAP but, agree, need training handling Karens, need signage, etc. 

I feel like basically retailers going play huge role getting pandemic somewhat control. One bad things buying selling home, visit others visit. (Not entirely good pandemic.) Ok. makes sense. would agree that, apparently, 90%+ havent identified sufficiently symptomatic hospitalized? high percentage also sufficiently symptomatic hospitalized? Much like flu sufferers?  easy afford give multi billion dollar corporations billion trillions dollars bailouts couple million struggling Americans...  Test, verify trust order. go ahead. I'm rush. It’s focus it’s fucking easy do. literally takes zero effort wear one inside. Offing answer even though times might feel way. I've gone periods stuck mindset fun. Message want someone talk/vent to. least entire country baked 120 degrees daily... yet. Fuck 'em. Cloth masks effective **stopping getting it**. effective stopping **giving others.**

People running buy N95s, wear cloth masks surgical masks. 

They said could stock PPE supplies healthcare workers actually *need* N95s. time settled new evidence showed virus rode along water droplets expelled people's mouths noses. 

So, following evidence, **added** recommendation people wear type mask all. still recommend people buying N95s unless they're immunocompromised highly risk due issues people properly fitted wear incorrectly. Also N95s release valve sneezed coughed one would expel virus anyway they're meant protect wearer necessarily patient nurses/doctors wear surgical masks top both.

It's defending, following actual path time understanding *why* decisions made science surrounding variables changed. legend, anyone? Outdoor wedding south august? 🤮 seen shit US pulled continues pull it’s surprising. mean existence things like CIA operations they’ve pulled alone... U.K. view government similarly evil it’s easier trust Irish Finnish governments since they’re trying major world players. US position dodgy... probably laughing one got excited possibility solution allow schools reopen safely, others test going work knowing nobody high enough viral load contagious. said ""People could go bars"".

They giddy virologists realizing along pool testing could mean fucking return normal save thousands lives 

So yeah happy.

I recommend jump 27 minute mark get lay person breakdown. Yea I’ve got idea then, find something “virus like particle” makes sense seems like Hail Mary funding.

Ehh...In theory, sure. don’t know anything rhinovirus (common cold) it’s genome fact mutates quick us vaccine conjecture. it’s found rhinovirus mutations share length genome, part genome used antigen (because that’s important part) theory yes, would willing bet part mutation occurs section genome encodes antigen would pretty useless. Another thing keep mind, genome influenza (again, something else don’t really know anything since that’s I’m working on, I’m already working 7 different things don’t time/room something I’m working on) 14000 nt (nucleotides) long whereas rhinovirus half that. (Again, pure conjecture-) it’s possible even rhinovirus’ share length common genome, may long enough work (ie-encode anything own/without rest genome) kind like know paragraph book (but book it’s from) figure book is, know sentence can’t (in extremely layman’s terms (hopefully I’m trying say makes sense?)).  point, covid19 (if memory serves, part I’m working know article read) allowed make jump humans it’s spike protein single (maybe couple, it’s stupid few) nucleotide mutation compared closest non human serotype. genome rhinovirus mutate single nucleotide, could enough shared amongst would enough encode for, multiple mutating, shared genome might long enough. Also, would depend mutation gets made. need 10 nt common (in row) work, mutation occurs somewhere 10, well yea might one works strains, new one anything descended would need new vaccine. likely it’s worth time/money. would nice, it’s practical...again though...pure conjecture Houston Phoenix air conditioned cities planet, right? takes away right breathe infectuous air right?  COVID Bus coming Also, test groups median age 34...and significant symptoms. What’s going happen 80+ year olds get vaccine? ones really need most. soo convenient, hear want hear nothing else! problem lot conflicting information sources whether wear mask. failure leadership across board, people become sceptical experts. long ago experts shaming people wearing masks. 

Saying people dumb helps one, makes people rigid resolve almost get ass holes....  aware occurs, kid covid coughing, etc, two weeks, probably shedding significant virus. enough say school kicks kid back first sign sniffles without negative test? I'm gonna die hill think student cases pretty rare, so, whatever, demand negative tests everyone return. Come think seen huge increase paper plates lately... Free college education this. way reboot future generations. Aren’t also backing Moderna, though? Thank helping understand nice it. kind human are. alot people still take situation serious enough wear masks. Well, placebo influencing brain, brain commands whole body. really fantastic thing, actually relieve pain believing taking something relieve pain. wonderful mind works. I'd rather someone lie position power.  right bigger slight Japan little boy fat man put together… First Osama this, fucking Pakistan man. losing license retirement fund worse death? people better politicians ordering risk lives? Teachers complicit go back work. share blame increased infections deaths.  Bullying least worries assure that. people fucking insane. Landlords need assistance \*so become homeless\*.

And also said... repeatedly... poverty, unemployment, homelessness deserve equal separate conversations. I'm dismissing plight unemployed landlords. I'm saying deserve conversation. Separately. homelessness. account they're fucking homeless. 

Housed people homeless grouped homelessness. 

A distinction I've made repeatedly. I'm Queen England

Do robust post history support claim openly talk experiences housing first initiatives. I've mentioned sub multiple times. 

I've posted type homeless programs, initiatives, success rates, etc. I've posted frustrations tied homelessness programs. That's small test group. We'll see side-effects give 30,000 people. Hopefully severe.

The big thing actually stop virus. Trump already given us recipe. Bleach UV rays bum. people think “low” (see quotations) mortality rate assume doesn’t mean anything else. I’ve begun look beyond death toll. someone going recovery months now, know people certainly worse me, stuff something want feel 120+ days real easy gamble peoples' money. cdc information which, according it’s fine print, date. problem is, don’t mandate hawaii, someone going like “fuck masks, I’m going hawaii!”

It nothing deal.  best option tell go fuck themselves. Someone else said $1100. fact check this. Literally posted don’t see segments mentioned, main stories weekly episode. Make mandatory Access areas services. Enforce police army.

That's Chinese way.  Thanks posting see stories, little hopeful/encouraging know older people come side virus things dire. Please explain ... simple terms .. Man, we're biological attack? Explains virus 'mutated' hit US shores messed numbers? Yes.

Does mean nobody dying Covid-19? No.

So, mean stop trying stop deaths? explain cases really high, deaths lagging expected gives every person right

You already right, whether throws pitch not. millionaires billionaires, poor shmucks like us stuck home past 4 months would like hope we'll able go baseball game near future.

I'm conspiracy theorist (or card carrying member either party), timing seems awfully convenient would require lot people accomplish task. ever believe politician public figure ever literally lied. 

Have *you* ever lied? anyone believe anything else say going forward?

Y’all holding impossible standard pandemic really highlighted fact huge chunk country made selfish, uneducated assholes. literally care unless effects them.

Depending vax trial here, possibly started 3+ years ago. rushed, quite rushed many people assume. vaccine works young healthy people seriously good step. one, worry spreading vulnerable. That'd least worries. Covid's 14 days, hep c herpes keeps. It’s simple, although fairly accurate. Canadian here, actually experience exact thing two main parties. Conservative Party Canada always focuses debt economy(so say), yet Liberal party always seems one right things. least long following politics.


Modern Conservatism morally ideologically bankrupt. Yet somehow people still believe spending debt wrong cutting responsible. generally means reallocation funds corporate welfare right. get greencard skilled worker, depending world, take two DECADES. delusional. obviously don’t live real world people need paycheck. 

You upset parents DEMANDING children go back, don’t even want kid wear mask “rights” 

Go fight them. reason situation teachers. Stop telling teachers fucking problem. PROBLEM!! People like you, parents, government biggest problems. don't?

I try find link. need pump numbers  never started. worked get extra aside stimulus check everyone else got. make unemployment employed anyways, everything opening back get asses back work. Doesn’t sound like makes sense. choice understand many likely won’t.
But idea sending child unqualified teacher qualified one online ridiculous.
And already unqualified teachers?!? Omg. state like that?

What mean unqualified? hadn’t passed yet education degree, advanced, flat education training?

Goodness. receiving Gulbenkian Price, actions, comes Price money one million 17 btw That’s disgusting even without pandemic going on. people fail realize doesn’t matter kids don’t get sick die rate older immunocompromised people. kids bring home get sick die. Sending school ensuring become carriers homes, grocery stores, family gatherings, etc. States reopening schools see spike cases deaths, won’t kids 100% would ones spreading it. thanks!  Especially ADE possibility.  People smarter taking seriously researching it:  I’ll keep mind! Michigan I've purposely going Aldis simply they've requiring, enforcing, people wear masks inside. damn good money saving too.

It’s infuriating (and scary!), it’s pointless. literally lack intelligence perceive threat respond appropriately. 

We live Florida. wife’s co-worker believes virus fake numbers made media try discredit president. believes hospitals conspiracy lying hospital situation nurse friend got sent home lack work. She’s stupid understand difference ICU nurse nurse works elective medicine.

You can’t educate people. avoid them. Unless can’t, course. Hence wife’s work situation. 🤷‍♀️ Oh forgot mention take vita pills daily cuz parents (my mom doesn’t like still wants go outside say no) Yup, that's I'd expect too. Thank you!!! salon invested thousands safe. Masks, faceshields, disinfect galore. told need move outside? expect us water source....where plug stuff in? supposed work cover 1 wall. this? paying thousands rent supposed recreate business, invest more, less people. Salons closing.

The ministry labour even consider refusal positive test within workplace. cannot can’t act “what if”. 

essentially MOL saying. hypothesize like.  Here's today's case/death charts Florida, running 7-day needs education, maybe study curves. second pandemic going many parts world: selfishness. : ) forget mention key thing here: Netherlands wants help southern countries issue reforms economies. good. solidarity.  way people taking beginning state thought to.  literally every news report followed calls Governor’s resignation he’s worst dictator since Adolf.  Stupid idiots. Good thing early. Otherwise things could gotten control. I've know since March friend med school shared info friends. LISTEN SCIENTISTS POLITICIANS!!! news denier getting sick/losing loved ones? mocking (after uninformed/ignorant), spread awareness end stupidity mask/social distancing refusal, pervasive dangerous virus itself.

It's really sickening watch innocent, compliant people falling ill COVID stubborn idiots prance around town without masks spread virus. means? source it? grammatical errors deliberate. discount based bad grammer scammer knows uneducated easy mark. We're point trials entering phase 3, human challenge trials would likely speed timelines. point, they're reckless. fifteen pound difference average person That's probably scientists people interested science way calm people like never really dived matter COVID-19 came along. naive people started follow news. news wrote like doomsday anxiety people even got worse. RIP condolences family!! Covid 19 cold flu.

It's cardiovascular disease.

Sometimes, viral infection associated flu like symptoms time because, again, COVID-19 cold flu.

We attempting define treat virus something caught cyclically. Thanks info! guess I’m concerned touch able socially isolate well (almost never going out) shopping basically one current connection outside word. wrote details another comment reply right. Yes likely survive? Please bear mind rationed care I’m aware cannulation ECMO. Outside Covid mortality ECMO approximately 50%. Man idk, swear went straight winter summer year. “Ok, like imagine ten thousand spoons. purposes don’t actually *need* spoon. argument’s sake, let’s say *really* need knife. 

Boom. Irony.” relaxed be? reason would still contemplate literally capable never going outside besides grocery shopping that’s basically way I’m getting infected (or parents get infected somehow, they’re inside mostly too), I’m forced go outside somehow. 

Thanks study link, appears scenario may happen lasting like 1-2 hours someone sick coughed it? issue shopping usually tired need move things around put groceries fridge touch everywhere, usually Lysol everything advice? Like don’t need Lysol make sure wash hands touch face? Wouldn’t still possible something one grocery Wisconsin’s tribal communities acted quickly help mitigate risk COVID-19 among members, **instating stay-at-home orders** similar Gov. Tony Evers place state Supreme Court struck May. also **promoted social distancing use masks early on**, closely following CDC’s recommendations.

So basically able obtain PPE follow steps, [rather sent body Keep mind results patients experiencing cytokine storm syndrome

&amp;#x200B;

Aren't (as virtually all) people dying Covid-19 precisely dying complications following cytokine storm? Got Facebook page taken down, huh Dr. Karen? ask see manager Facebook it? see video logs now. British government got lot shit thing care homes. really see anyone get pass frankly. knew February elderly risk yet sent, New York, London, knows else, deaths. Thread’s gonna locked 3 2 1 Yeah every single record hospitalization means least 10 days away even more. Every single record set means worst yet come that’s infeasible draconian. Karen's: *surprised Pikachu face* tested positive one else circle gotten sick, including immediate family live with. Strange, I’m definitely complaining. air travels edges mask enters people’s lungs edges mask. analogy radiation poisoning mean repeated exposure low viral doses make infection likely (linear threshold model) body's immune response able fight low dose exposures, given bit time, therefore viral load ""resets"" zero exposure? latter, amount time exposures matter? words, receive two low dose exposures 24 hours apart, less likely contract COVID 19 receive two exposures within minutes other? studies I've seen seem indicate prolonged exposure virus (i.e. indoor setting classroom workplace) increases risk unclear chances greater time coming contact carrier shedding significant amount virus repeated exposure smaller viral doses cumulative occur short period time. make sense? nothing better protest masks really need get hobby....other protesting masks. Even vaccine determined safe ready distribute September, take time produce enough glass vials hold vaccine, enough syringes, etc. Plus sheer time take people physically go doctor/clinic, fill paperwork, receive vaccine, leave next patient come. Like many people building getting injected once. think even best case scenario still many months ahead us.

*Editing add: agree point delaying stimulus. zero faith another round stimulus checks. seem recall china drones flying around making sure anyone outside mask on. also advised italy early measures insufficient noone wearing masks.

China deploy drones enforce mask requirements brief period.

The problem sufficient.

China ultimately lock people Wuhan communities. dug roads. Welded exits shut.

Because masks sufficient. shakes think closer 10th percent 1%. Even double get .2% still insanely low rate death warrant freak out.

Edit: would also assume 42% people US infected. 100% would say 50% find out. I'm pretty sure every zombie movie starts. Worldwide rollout vaccine thought safe turns zombie apocalypse months later. 

I kid, course. story told before. meant replicate, idea typed mutate. Lol. it’s basically body vs couple dudes body vs Army. Interesting. closest anyone gotten country New York. New York, demand vents notwithstanding, never came close running vents stockpile within state thousands ventilators never utilized. fact, surge receded ventilator demand same, able give ventilators states.

Cutting older fleet ventilators even close thing running out. Ah thank clarifying, misunderstood. Every country demand it. actually many demands it. vaccine probably demand too.  ethics giving vaccine healthy people world rather risk No, wish ALL. many senseless deaths. agree you.  live country pandemic never took hold, Thailand, even though probably lot visitor contact China US does. would strange everyone wearing masks main thing made difference. 

We wearing masks January related pollution levels Bangkok, amounted continuing wear one different reason March. Maybe shut-down complete too, pre-emptive reactionary; seemed so. pandemic essentially completely 6 weeks, confirmed cases ever amounted around 3000 (3255 per one dashboard, course real number lot higher).

We still wear masks. work people take back off, walking around city using trains to, can't get one without wearing mask, grocery store without one on.  case counts rise, state allow indoor gatherings 3,000 people.

Wait, what? I'm curious, got way amazon? think mean drown freedoms. died economy.

/s

This monstrous. think?

Why don’t show us.  Gallup measuring U.S. adults' use face masks since early April found nearly nine 10 say used one in past week.

That 44% quoted breakdown sub category.

Did read link... close bars people continue partying secret. Meanwhile reddit active anti-mask subs running rampant ""valuable discussion"" young man fantastic physical condition known medical conditions killed COVID. one safe virus. yet schools can’t open. Thank God bars, restaurant, theme parks, essential businesses able open stimulate economy. School doesn’t matter good economy. It’s like kids need education parents need relived home schooling actually go work. point people wearing lace masks cheap/protest masks literally nothing. 

If wearing cloth mask, recommended 180 thread count Wake Forest Medical study concluded 180 performs well surgical mask.  which, er, people have, dude. ""i regularly experience installing removing thing, therefore makes sense extrapolate experience everyone."" yeah, that's works. lot people spent lives living homes central a/c. talking nursing forum something I’ve always aware (and take precautions lower potential high viral load) ICU Covid nurse early March. wonder family members get sicker even die. living house together sick, last one get sick gets exposed virus constantly breathing viral shredding. breathe in, get sick keep replacing fresh supply virus add illness get higher viral load. helping virus increase yourself
by masking everyone sick. I’ve telling family members ones hospitalized phone wear masks around stay apart. think people mindset sick already it’s okay. It’s not. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* That’s point..... Politicians. colds. don’t know anyone who’s cold since lockdown masks began. Virgin coconut oil claimed ""miracle food"" product decades. country advertised scammers cure could even deal cancer. pure bull. Maybe next bring back green bean coffee avocados covid cure. worldometer Florida numbers drastically different Florida arcgis website department health? (Physicians perspective) great article.

My 2 cents:

The interplay viral kinetics v immune response kinetics occurs **upper** respiratory tract important battle. start small dose much better off.

If virus allowed travel south lung, virus replication accelerated **big time** (prob due many binding receptors, easy-bind receptors, both) - hypoxia occurs immune response adapted properly fucked.

To summarise:  must get virus, want:

1. small dose possible AND...
2. **You want inoculate far away lungs possible!** San Diego experiencing this? live Carlsbad, isn’t far San Diego still apart county one wearing mask  Median*  kind masks talking about? Cloth?

That’s great all, shouldn’t Fauci trying stop Covid instead making bigger spectacle already is? wear masks Wendy... metaphorically speaking. apologize, poorly worded. contagious, meant since contagious longer, may potentially capable spreading virus people. That's said ""more contagious"" - obv inference higher viral loads. That's meant, good catch, poor word choice part. 

Let rephrase, ""Asymptomatic cases conditions may make capable spreading virus people sympomatic cases."" 2x make isn’t even close would take move SF. idea would hats guess. Every store SF Bay Area pretty much required masks since early March. Glad that, cases still spiking people can't stay away indoor malls, bars, 50+ people house parties. knows who's right wrong. virus keeps throwing knuckleballs us. whole droplet/aerosol/airborne thing really silly. Anyone ever looked spray garden hose sunny day, see different sizes droplets. big ones lots water. smallest ones still make wet.

So, staying away people much can, using P-100 masks face shields go somewhere.  filters specs HEPA filters -- far better N-95's. Hey mods, randomly flair threads ""misleading title"" explanation. guy gets it. second sentence fucked. I'll take downvotes heathens FUCKING SAY

Who would thought barrier keeps virus going mouth nose could ALSO keep entering mouth nose?

WHAT AMAZING FUCKING DISCOVERY

Their excuse masks dumb sheep, refuse wear one. long there's consequences people ignore science wear free mask. may put five minutes avoid jail, moment realize that's bare minimum need do, moment take free mask off. can’t start NOW? stop Dollar General yesterday essential item (soap). noticed behind register, employees wearing masks. live Deep South, amount people shopping wearing mask absolutely staggering.

In dear third homeland , joy injury apparently high. get strange emails Norwegians triumphantly compare number pandemic deaths Sweden Norway. email writers explain dramatic difference with, one hand, incredible Norwegian skill art handling new hitherto unknown corona virus covid-19 world's medical expertise. hand, extremely incompetent stupid Swedes.

**I tried** cautious objections alternative explanations. example, big difference Norwegian Swedish skiing. ski season's holiday periods Easter school holidays, Norwegians ski Norway. Swedes, especially Stockholmers, prefer travel Alps. Danes ski.

**During** Europe's critical infection period February-March, one million Swedes holiday trips. could explain Stockholm, Oslo Copenhagen, strong initial spread infection. Maybe, know?

However, Norwegian opponents accept explanation different number deaths Norwegian intelligence Swedish idiocy. 

**Politicians our** Scandinavian neighbors missed opportunity emphasize epidemiological superiority. Like Norway's Prime Minister [Erna (H) skilfully judged travelers Gotland could go separate ways. Denmark's Prime Minister [Mette (S) approved Västerbotten, Skåne, Blekinge Smålanders.

But sure, admit. international match counting number deaths, neighbors lead far probably pandemic's half.

This means, among things, million Swedes point, soon many more, immune. pandemic behaves like predecessors, second half get worse. Norway Denmark hit much harder Sweden. However, know little Erna Solberg Mette Frederiksen.

**Another and** pronounced joy political injury fills inbox find many deaths possible non-privatized care elderly. numerical examples, writers seem want show privatized care elderly best, ergo capitalism best.

Such reasoning proof based misunderstanding, possibly intentional one.

To claim privatization care elderly deadly effect claim public care always better profit-making privatized. best institutions elderly are, course, private for-profit. case that, example, new thousand dollar millionaires added Sweden recent years seek best expensive existence old age. capitalism and, seen right, desirable state.

**Privatization fanaticism it** comes public activities political idea ravaged Sweden thirty years. Even privatization leads poorer train traffic, pharmacies, healthcare, home care, dentistry area, desirable transformation right-wing ideological point view.

And political development, Sausages innocent either, anyone believed it.

The ""new social democracy"" emerged 80's, Sweden, invested ""businesslikeness"" fuzzy ideas ""New Public Management"", run country company, turn citizens ""customers"" thus skip obsolete ideology people's homes equality. 1980, Sweden world's equal country. Since then, development declined furious pace.

**Businesslikeness geriatric care** means cost hunting, cheaper staff, poorer employment conditions, cheaper equipment, etc. got new type Social Democrats, look sound like Mikael Damberg invest using politics springboard go business world get rich. Consider difference Tage Erlander Göran Persson.

Higher mortality geriatric care thus inexorable consequence political business idea. respect, Sweden unfortunately far ahead Norway Denmark. precisely difference hurting neighbors careful invoke.

… Ulf Lundell unfortunately point criticizes book mentioning rap artist ASAP Rocky ""rock artist"". Apologize. findings showed two 100 infected people caught virus non-household contacts, one 10 contracted disease families. 

I feel like there's enough room outside two options account 88% cases. admire optimism empathy here, misplaced. can't reason people reject objective reality. Fuck Texas Fuck Fake Religious Schools  gov wasn’t elected? bad man.... tax cuts .  symptoms vary greatly person person. wholly incorrect Exactly somebody bring home would suggest uses grandchildren test subjects test theory. Korean epidemiologists found people likely contract new coronavirus members households contacts outside home.

So first person get twits. gets worse get older. really? act closed every aspect society. bars, restaurants, shops, large events. there's risk fear virus things rapidly go back normal we've already seen original statement still exists. people like Trump get slandered. misinformation gets repeated within echo chamber.

Gotcha Luckily evidence leading vaccine groups ADE - big issue would probably signs now. anyone total piece shit wants run office, especially south?

That’s people don’t understand lesson learned hard New York - lock everything down, nothing changes weeks. infection rate deaths everything keeps increasing weeks later ‘catches up’ lockdown. lock hospitals already flowing it’s late. Every month March, every day Wednesday. don’t non mask wearing idiots understand. Oh right. don’t like read. bad. can't. people caught made examples of, vast vast majority ignore it, going entirely undetected. really expend effort resources strategies actually work. Every state laser focused reducing person person infection rate within borders introduction new cases outside state becomes manageable risk, rather trying enforce un-enforcable. leveraged, squatters taken property government allowing it. r/conspiracy that's pretty interesting well. paper post might suggest heard immunity could reasonable goal.

If show little long term consequences asymptomatic people simply focus reducing infectious dose.

Unfortunately, called question Israeli doctor contracted virus second time :(  word mild might right word choice.

1 child 19 years old died.
1 teacher died.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* - put shopping, touch wash/sanitize hands.. though biggest issue everyone wearing masks, they're constantly right next other. either they're impatient want grab something front market, plain false sense security got mask on. easily comes rude ask someone little space.

also people wearing masks incorrectly, constantly adjust mask (e.g. workers stocking things people touch literally everything grocery store)... what's recourse someone covering mouth nose, pull mask talk someone, like saw someone walking grocery store holding piece paper towel mouth? Youre coming snarky condescending. think last weekend Splash Mountain break completely right giant plunge. news video showed people exiting ride. Obese, white, paunchy boomer grandparents equally obese children grandchildren. wearing dumbass Mickey ears merch. Nothing changed. People past days completely misstating Oxford saying. 

They always said vaccine could start rolling Sept/Oct, wont put use then. already producing millions ship anytime, but... people seem think we'll getting shots October things back normal next year... aint happening. may preemptively shipped around world mean they'll put use right away. 

Also clarifying “The chance us getting vaccine Christmas actually **highly effective** are, view, low,” Whitty told Van-Tam, however, said “cautiously optimistic **some** vaccine side Christmas.”

From we've seen Phase trial Moderna Oxford vaccines, takes 1 shot really effective. clarifying here, even vaccine end year (that start given general public) may first multiple shots start positive effect get lives back normal. Yeah, fuck lowlifes buying things can't afford.

A lot people live paycheck paycheck money budget luxuries. Internet really considered utility definitely still luxury can't afford. money going right back out, lot people bank accounts run risk overdrafts fees balances low. mean could eat get chance move Mono right? 3 years ago still feel like crap.

I pick something Lowe's Meridian Overland week two ago, maybe 10% mask usage (nobody laughed wearing one though).  Home Depot East Boise couple days later 90%.  incredible difference.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

To limit SARS-CoV-2 introduction, United States restricted travel China February 2 Europe March 13, 2020. March 15, community transmission widespread New York City (NYC).

**What added report?**

The NYC Department Health Mental Hygiene conducted sentinel surveillance influenza-like symptoms (ILS) genetic sequencing characterize community transmission determine geographic origin SARS-CoV-2 infections. Among 544 specimens tested persons ILS negative influenza test results, 36 (6.6%) positive. Genetically sequenced positive specimens closely resembled sequences circulating Europe.

**What implications public health practice?**

Partnering health care facilities establishing systems sentinel surveillance capacity genetic sequencing outbreak inform timely public health response strategies. guy trying hardest make lockdown locking dreams. like never heard word ""Activist"", learn something. GF works mouse. says that, least area, protections guests terrible, least pushed past functional breaking point due low park attendance.

Additionally, extreme inconsistency quality lower level leadership. 
A colleague GFs said 'Disney great job making operation idiot proof, proceeded hire bunch idiots.'.
As such, leaders entirely top game; also many leaders telling cast members gems ""well got tested, keep coming work show symptoms, results get back"". soul board ship wearing mask

Tokyo one making English headlines most, partly highest number among regions far.

Over here, Osaka reports tend make individual news entries, that's unless there's major cluster incident. too!

RCT always better, unfortunately times get. There's lot time.

In discussion discussed usage historical control However, potential (time) period effect may affected effect inherent design study cannot adjusted for. control patients admitted least 3 weeks earlier patients treatment group. patients got sick period 1, initial phase pandemic, cannot precluded COVID-19-associated CSS severe period 1 period 2, patients received less optimal supportive care first hectic weeks pandemic infected patients first hour simply worst health. argument, however, also reversed. period 1 intensive care capacity still relatively high consensus among experts start low-threshold mechanical ventilation, patients period 2 ‘compete with’ already occupied high-care facilities staff got exhausted. patients control group treatment group already received mechanical ventilatory support baseline reflective situation. Adjustment imbalance affect treatment effect. argument COVID-19-associated CSS severe period 1 compared period 2 also lacks substantiation. start protocol coincided peak COVID-19 admissions Netherlands (2 April) preceded peak mortality 5–7 incidence density admissions mortality increased period 1 decreased period 2, mortality fraction number hospital admissions Netherlands actually higher period 2 period 1. indirect argument, argues better prognosis patients COVID-19-associated CSS period 2. Still, dealing new disease standard care rapidly evolving. Changing policies respect start mechanical ventilation, diagnosing thrombosis anticoagulation therapy occurred even within time frame study. trend finding pulmonary embolism treatment group, instance, reflection searching scrutiny thrombosis time. developments impact external validity (generalisability) study others published, may responsible treatment effects daily practice seem less dramatic contrasts found early study. 

The data drugs sub-optimal certainly less optimal dexamethasone, certainly impressive something look forward outcomes robust and, especially confirmed randomised trials later on, highly relevant medical societal perspective. 

So RCT way luckily. likely both. ""narrative"" pretty simple. know covid-19 kills people. 

It's fact narrative really.

Consider construction firm: can't pay laborers stay home work unless expect clients pay company constructing. That's obviously going happen. 

You can't magic enough money government pay everyone stay home. That's financial equivalent perpetual motion machine. Taxes percentage everyone's income. Even full refund every penny collected make much difference.

There reasonable middle ground; wear mask, take unnecessary risks, etc. hiding cave forever option. Blame article, researchers adding research body evidence. Article framed moronically. Oh I've read wrong. need answer arrogant way though. need schools running restore economy. teachers exempt expect frontline healthcare workers, police fire grocery store clerks perform essential duties?

Good, kids go school become plague rats kill countless others, themselves. matter, 'cause least kids school. similar camp weeks “new death”, it’ bad go 700k maybe 850k, go on. government failed us need move it. 

My concern lot deaths choices people make themselves. Obesity kills lot people fat neighbor won’t breathe give heart disease. I’m still amazed cigarettes allowed country cause damn death toll attached, yet stay away smokers.

What can’t working retail avoid people breathing store. That’s threat now.

Also worry still early stages could become, “year one” lose 250k, next year gets worse lose million, following year another million, on. country couldn’t handle that. Never meanin' harm! peak capitalism.

It's *up to* 65%, using N95 masks. Medical 12-16-layer cotton masks also offer protection, notably less N95. evaluate simple cloth masks any. sadly made America great adapting best practices countries instituted taking new levels. mindset disappeared Reagan man, communist health care sucks ;-) ;-)

It make hate freedom turn gay. way come here. Muhahaha waiting this! ""Faith church faith God"" usual organized religion propaganda blame them? Businesses shuttering good, people work, socialist sheeple corporations expect customers bow New World Order, cuckold devil's jockstrap complete 5G LTE nose antenna hoax flu.


/s  Special place reserved guy ilk. nice shilling. people installed, impact battery life? Darwin watching. need understand Rt instead R0, mention fact that's merely average. understanding, virus much smaller pores thar cotton masks. article takes given mask ""filter"" virus particles air breath in, really seeing accomplish this. virus suspended air likely even touch cotton material float right pores material cause high viral load.. missing here? someone ELI5? always wore mask assuming single virus entering body would cause full blown infection. mask modify virus entering? mean isnt vaccine does???? Walmart President! I'm epi thing always thing about. 


Years ago investigation carbon monoxide poisoning resulted two deaths one permanent disability (and minor illnesses). remember compiling annual data bunch causes death one bosses saying something many CO deaths year, good, could think faces people explaining happened last time saw family member alive. read article would see it’s 14 studies one, guess don’t want facts getting way agenda right... Well find something new. People subreddit research precautions NBA taking bubble. They're going fine. split time Minnesota, Florida, temporarily North Carolina, no. Agreed. good news us good times. infuriating much misinformation spreads. think states mostly virus control reopening would want shut states. ask different vaccinations. mainly wear one consider courtesy people.

Honestly, point, habit. Go store, put mask, walk inside. going take shake needing grab mask purse entering store over. one only! video posted someone facebook. One friends gave metaphor cottonseed tiny carried fluff tree. We're might stopping virus, we're stopping spit/snot carried by. 

The original poster said, quote, ""no matter much scientific proof, you’ll find way refute it.""

I can't even... impossible transmit via touch, large part transmission originally thought. Good idea still wash hands frequently wipe heavily used surfaces probably need crazy disinfectant routine people back things popped off. Deaths still trending back down. I'm sure come conclusion visiting making informed mind. Surely listen media. ever actually get tested received negative Covid19 result? No? never got KNOW of... surgical style masks metal wire wire across top good job preventing glasses fogging up. cloth mask wire, cloth masks without wire make impossible see. Note: 3 dots represent 3 lives. collect 1,000 upvotes given extra life  google ""HIV immune system"" see similarities. mean makes sense using HIV drugs like remdesivir fight covid 19 actually working way HIV. difference being, far know, covid 19 kills cells infects them. covid infection turns critical would similar like fast progression HIV/AIDS. would think one expose amount virus have. 

Like, Person viral load 100, infects Person B viral load 10 (because B wear masks), Person B expose spouse viral load 10, matter much make out.

Obviously numbers nonsense used example.

Edit: stand corrected. Helpful information below! moved LA Georgia difference night day literally every single store gas station indoor location requires mask, GA literally nowhere required it, well except stores started requiring today. definitely implied wasn’t.  Finally! I’ve trying tell people months.  People really skills cope situation like this, challenging enough even good strategies still hard. sympathize people saying ""I can't keep dealing it"" also ""can't keep dealing it"". also can't deal watching people know die needlessly. can't deal more. Read this, pretty quick: Nah dont think isnt damn thing it. 

There isnt master plan, creating fear based society I'm going live life normally. scared stay home. likely get virus without mask really dont give shit anymore. Chill out. schools reopening really important, country needs lockdown NOW. Like tomorrow. There’s way remotely safely don’t take measures advance. yep makes sense, thanks! Thanks Depends ask, basically rankings 2-3 UK universities (Oxford, Cambridge, sometimes Imperial) 7-8 US universities (HYPSM plus others, dependent ranking methodologies) top 10. generally pretty good opinion. They're race Delhaize America. assertion antifa demonstrators? worry, terrible matter view it! shitty life come downplay fuck good news? Great Facebook. 3 months late....And late help USA.

You dont tackle racism, antivaxxers, anti LGBT cyber bullying posts yes, congratulations banning one covid 19 group. take it, stand what's right advertisers withdrawing money site conscience. It’ll news cycle. It’ll occupy media days head years’ advertise “open discussion” “welcoming” mask-wearers anti-maskers, say anything wearing mask you’re downvoted hell sometimes straight banned sub. 
I commented simple, Japan many wear masks indoors outdoors, got downvoted, got DM’d dude saying spreading BS.  
Dude, live here. look outside window literally watch tens people walk wearing masks...I wasn’t sharing opinion, literal fact. 😅 
 
Edit; huh, actually looked back said comment got upvoted back 0. that’s plus guess lol. PPP Loan least 75% loan needs used cover employees paychecks.

That's said obviously agree church defying lockdown. got loan lockdown affects income pay employees. Don’t care sports. However, many do. least proceed could help many regarding mental health. Yay! fantastic news! stand corrected.  Oh that’s awful! Best luck. inject coconut oil bleach shine light it. get sue kid dies Covid? brother pharmacy Europe says masks sold 1/5 stock regular flu/cold medication. see potential positive outcome this. think cruise ship study referring asymptomatic passengers began show symptoms course study. numbers initial tests. Oh also Asian grocery stores don’t know live live ICU beds almost full. reopen schools run recourses people would otherwise lived die, 

When testing cases decrease ideally people would isolate positive. countries testing helped get control. 

The CDC wants Americans wear masks a
have case study prove helps prevent covid spreading. mask protects you. mask protects me. wearing mask disrespectful everyone around you. Especially since trouble social distancing. watched video exact concept day It’s definitely new concept immunology, fact NPR talking might broaden reach information! Fingers crossed. can’t trust humans selfless, general trust self-serving. Sounds like perfectly logical decision. people decide health own. Furthermore, people often sound &amp; come across educated intelligent, harder hide.

That part condescending hell.

And yes, fucking lie. don’t check.

You’d think “smart” guy would know that. kind schizophrenic mental gymnastics

Science? GoodRx.com website type medication name &amp; dose &amp; gives prices &amp; coupons use local/chain pharmacies. doesn’t take personal info, don’t worry HIPAA. time price cheaper I’d pay insurance. 

(Most discount med sites &amp; cards don’t actually give price med upfront— pharmacy process code checkout, might cheaper insurance price. pharmacies also stopped price checks bc it’s time consuming.) Phase 3 vaccine trial see vaccine actually works approved safe phase 1 phase 2. people participating phase 3 actually 'privileged' instead 'Guinea pig'. first humans actually safe virus without getting infected. Social distancing lock pertinent mask wearing. Mask wearing relevant reopening. area wore masks inside along 

So really Nice Masks dont merely protect wearer.

Proceeds talk wearer. evidence protects others? remember ""Great Clips"" incident. many cases expected. seems masks work, could get everyone try them. I’m way doctor expert, take reading articles:

Yes. there’s difference contracting covid (enough test positive) exposed infectious dose. former means disease, body recognized likely creating antibodies. latter would mean inhaled infectious dose contract COVID-19 disease virus. 

There’s still definitive evidence regarding antibodies, far know. Everyone treating situation they’ve never virus, even test positive antibodies (until conclusive data found). sadly case. Viruses replicate exponentially, billions even trillions times over.

That arbitrary 10 viral particles quickly becomes 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280... etc etc. 

This happens well advance someone infectious. source literally says masks arent proven effective covid 19. 

All read bit click button bring page up. 

Data shown mixed effectivity masks. still wear mine. dont deny facts dont shame like dog bullshit. 

Also logic flawed. learned 50% people tested positive asymptomatic cases- meaning lot people anticipated. Meaning tests wouldnt yield negatives. entire logic flawed- also positive rate covid tests actually pretty low amount tests administered. could fact infectious disease. 

All countries europe enforced lockdowns mask mandates similar covid situations proportionally. 

You say wear masks precaution, CDC literally said that. cant lie claim fact firm science supporting it. 

Also AAP, ya know, dozens pediatricians medical degrees say would send children back school. two observations (as european):

1. took 7 months!! news presenters, politicians, president etc... wore masks LITERALLY second day country took action. literally next day, 7 months delay kinda... guess better nothing.
2. United effort defeat Invisible China Virus, many people say Patriotic wear face mask can’t socially distance. nobody Patriotic me, favorite President!

Even Kin Jong Un would hesitate put out. reality now? even North Korean propaganda subtle US president announcement. 😁 Ok, still pay taxes. pay back loan start making money again. put lime coconut first or.. must feel nice punch downwards poor people can’t afford live San Francisco.  Look upside. 

At least virus bring light cluster b personality disorders people. 

I'm going keep posting people need aware human behavior. 

Let's beat around bush call people ""assholes."" need honest realize ""assholes"" likely malignant personality disorders. 

I'm US work academia / research ...it's pretty enlightening US mental health crisis going on. Narcissism anti-social behaviors become norm society. pretty scary witness past months. Remember teenage rebellion met smoking little dope alley behind school?

Now teenage rebellion means refusing die deadly disease. Insert ""let eat cake"" quip  100% correct know union said they've got multiple callers questioning they're gonna give final plan everybody's waiting hear whether they're gonna open gonna quit retire medical records walk back school comes September Conflicting sources reporters saying they’re tested outlets deny transmission probability mouth + nose greater transmission probability pores skin second hand exposure? sourdough bread recipe combined 'salty' video game reference. correct I’m wrong (which likely am) aren’t looking longer infection death rate? in, initially reported 14 days, closer 28, could time see death rate catch alarming infection rates? Assuming still keep distance reasonably good health, likely mild/asymptomatic case. sub continue disregard reinfection nah? coming motherfucker even speak one bit importance vitamin deficiency immune response. exactly point government want govern? Seems weird somehow less people die Monday days. People exactly choose die deaths around number every day. Dilution solution. choosing believe ignorant people influenced kind stuff, also (similar elections heavily influenced) seeing huge influx malignant misinformation drive people towards beliefs. Illegally move Canada?? guess I’m asking mechanism infection surface contact. I’m assumption virus enter lungs infect. that’s case, mechanism essentially virus becoming airborne either hand mouth/nose it’s surface? virus reaching mucus membrane like nasal cavity eyes still mechanism infection? Oklahoma's governor too, despite catching virus himself. claimed last week would mandate masks... curious see mounting pressure GOPers, state's, Trump cause cave make mandate. Nailed There's different levels wrong I'd curious hear numbers 14,000Children 1200 employees,So far 50 people retired, taking leave absence next year,I'm returning...I work home.... medical issues,and life safety others important. stop flood stupidity studies shown 1/3 Americans won’t want take first batch.

You know what....I think that's ok 2/3 Americans able take first 1/3 batches anyway. SII like 10 kms Oh, something else claims prove one thing yet really toss up. interview OP really couldn’t provided less actual evidence anything. referenced study admits could factors play, talked “other countries” times, factories... somewhere, wrapped up. 

What bothers zero consistency literally anything, yet keep hearing we’ve always known that. 

The interviewee said we’ve known 100+ years less exposure virus weaker impact. Well, weren’t encouraged wear masks day 1? did/does guidance form CDC match that. could study posted show opposite. 

I’d faith heard Dr say “you know what, we’re learning go here...” hope noted latest relief package comes caveat defunding CDC &amp; NIH Well may solution. Fix crap schools need open fall. concidering unfortunate philosophy america taken, see happening. wish, would love us handle right right way happen ungodly reason. data showing significant number asymptomatic cases places high mask usage.

Cuomo threatened lawsuit Call police report state license plate spotted.  understand get downvoted, I'm always paying cash get sounds condescending.

Both scenarios illegal happen daily basis thousands people. virus killed point.... buses anything go hold much hope. notes table one...Control group bmi two points higher, actually tested positive covid ten percent more, hypertension fifty percent more, diabetes sixty percent more. Hmm, interesting.

Then, I'll hope vulnerability discovered fixed soon enough. free software 'good eyes' looking 'bad eyes', likely they're fixed they're exploited. I've read seems like part reason. I'm also guessing virus develops, go extinct. Also many people may reject vaccine. Yeah, right rain that. dont blame Corona, blame government response Corona that. hate governments worst ""cures"" complain ineffectiveness ""cure"" general. 

A lot americans suffering government assistance time, instead government helping despite virus, say anything worse. Instead, let's let bunch people die, cause us anything worse that, apparently. People masks love taking loads face Heard interview Bloomberg (news) one Oxford doctors. 

And probably stated vaccine ""very effective"" without booster, kids screaming needed wrap quickly. bad.

Essentials buying renting home/apartment, enrolling children local school, getting proper vaccinations, obtaining right permits bring pets over, cost shipping items internationally, dealing new country's culture government system, etc. things people need consider. 

Then consider even qualify citizenship country. allow dual citizenship? offer skills would beneficial workforce, strengthens chances granted citizenship, long would need live qualify? Would degree recognized move new country, so, way? enough funds move, since countries require show proof funds obtain visa?

edited clarity Talk sociopaths psychopaths! Yes, kids get it, die others lifelong consequences. also take Covid-19 back parents, grandparents hit even harder.

GOP Death Cult. people ask questions malicious intent. really care answer, want cast nefarious shadow swear, feels like sub left actually uses logic reasoning. Plenty grocery store/food workers going it.

No, pseudo-intellectual falsehoods get propagated.

You acknowledge idiocy equal science logic.  one witty joker. guys clearly majority here.

My 3 year old daughter wears half mask valve, protection class N99. wears every walk, wears without taking off.

For younger children, also solutions based soft, non-molded respirators. put little effort took deliver wonderful joke, find information need Google, Bing, elsewhere. course, find counterarguments too, as: ""This child, cannot forced wear mask!""

But already answered above, cannot explain child he/she needs wear mask, child able understand he/she needs wear mask - hell carrying child everywhere? think others take care protection protection child, wear masks without valves, torturing lungs, ""well, child, cannot understand, cannot forced""?

You perfectly illustrate original message. "" give shit themselves, I?"" they? 

The said South Korea. 

I haven’t seen studies many cases Singapore really caught. 

The reason people thought South Korea Singapore caught cases seemingly stopped spread. 

But it’s becoming clearer there’s something substantial virus we’re missing got completely wrong.  hope one close you, also die this. Best luck yours. Yup, I’m sure like many families, 73yo high risk mom living us. actually pretty good job keeping illnesses away her, covid long incubation period. say lets go back protesting masses downtown without social distancing blame Orangemanbad again. outbreak local Aldi Virginia.

Only took 2-3 months anyone care. UK, shoot, stab. fair concerts kinda main concern right now. big issues mass protests anything like Europe, pissed youth wants party. Economy life going ""cultural"" part go too, things like help us identify &amp; eliminate biggest risk factors we've done restaurants, public transport far. can't hide that.

No, absolutely deny it, rationalize it, ignore it.

With Trump régime actively fucking reporting numbers, anyone going know *everyone* knows someone died it? think they're going discussing social media? *so* invested concept ""lIbErAl hOaX"", there's way they're going admit evidence would invalidate stupid story.

And even *did* turn began realize lot ""excess deaths"", they'll rationalize ""old age/pre-existing conditions/the flu"" etc.

There truth powerful cannot denied. young woman inspiration. world needs people like her. check-ins actually anything? think it’s important reporting Covid. Laws stiff penalties. People die otherwise. Fuck persuading them. right stupid ends threatens others. sounds like servitude willful employment. guess dont see difference. strike protest. I'm actively trying convince anyone.

This argument. discussion over. folks wear masks beyond convincing, they've ignored science, want acknowledge legitimize bullshit get attention.

Narcissism. Can't argue someone that. know places aren’t US right? may surprising actually two countries world! want tissue? really cost ton money move another country. Work visas language barriers difficult, unreasonable ""normal"" people move new country That's kinda part makes angry, think everyone least responsible respect rules. way bend fit individual view weird, others outright call sheep want follow rules lives matter, lives matter others. I'm sorry pointing much dumbass tried shit us billionth time. Americans brainwashed fools live tyrannical state lives worth much ours, please soft-skinned feel offended simple observation ;) typical American gets 2 weeks vacation year. They’re going self isolate 14 days tourist. situation described took place Nashville, TN suburb.

Also, def asshole. know know - sayin'. love side always capitalizes boldfaces “rule law” want it’s something disagree with. It’s like magical “end discussion!” think let immediately get way without argument. 216 influenza cases Australia June, 57,842 June 2019.

I’d say Covid related social distancing, mask wearing general sensible behaviour pretty much nipped seasonal flu bud!

(Winter Aus). know we're talking fictional super-villain here, least showed willing personally sacrifice achieve goals vs sacrifice others.  Plus survived using stones pretty clearly fucked well.  start eating rich? cares point deserve die wife used get Starbucks **every day.** We're working home got bunch coffee International creamers (ahh try Cinnabon sometime) we're saving *tons* money. Cocaine money. Reminds movie. Rich powerful able board escape boats we're notified via messages.

Probably use drive thru things currently employ testing administer vaccine citizens line students don’t also threat deported hanging heads. That’s long timeline, it’s probably true either. meema peepaw can’t see photos grands Facebook, migrate slow usage much, won’t matter. considering handling it, could double.

Murican way hard work boomers done quell disease. got embarrassed deleted. Everybody poops, Andy could apply sporting events too. people stands would similar movement patterns concerts. Enough could draw correlations anyway. wrong""  worst-case scenario, prolonged steadily increasing spread, 5,437 corona deaths expected, instead previous 7,200.  Public Health Agency's head analysis, Brouwers, asked could wrong, says decimal numbers rounded nearest whole number.  fault rounding fault.  turned completely wrong result?  sum lot small numbers 0.01 integers, so. Output presented without rounding, gives correct result summing.  could wrong beginning?  statistician wrote rounded up, danger all, says head analysis Brouwers.

I'm really wondering one manages this, since first thing we're taught using rounding ""how much error introducing"". hardly even work numbers. someone comes one successful asian countries (Taiwan) curbed spread covid19, laughable. 

The common sense people lack knowing spreads EVERYONE taking precautions equivalent someone debating fire hot certain situations cold freaking ice. He's got Sharpie, all. Gotta drink em mask tho true. mechanic los angeles dealership, coworkers wear masks.  mask form seal along bridge nose. Mine pipe cleaner press face, sealed well, glasses fog up. Precisely.  Absolutely. I'm hoping change starting, much wrong effecting people never realized/cared. I'm naive, know going happen anytime soon, we'll fighting least 2024 election. hope one day we'll fix system enough end choosing two evils again. want people able live love without fear death one's taking care them. know possible others done it. rich ppl want change stubborn 😜 I’ve seeing ground! hard actually put can? think get one next fall, think it’s long way off.

Scaling interesting pharma it’s hard put together, similar vaccines brought framework done correctly.

These huge companies likely correctly. think 5-8 months time range, knows?  Comments like exactly help failing point perception wrong.

Some people worried government tracking would probably read comment think supporting idea contact tracing basically government surveillance.

Irish one compatible others type due open border Northern Ireland. app also used Gibraltar compatible Spanish one. Singapore awesome tracing going on. Almost infections outside home. rushing lead end.  Fun fact: US prisoners today prison system, lies beyond UN observation jurisdiction countless allegations brutal, systemic torture murder, USSR's gulags peak inmates Nazi war criminals, even adjust stats per capita.

We test Coronavirus vaccines prisons кomrade. I've 100% gotten ac units much cheaper granted they're obviously smallest models. 

I probably able either tbh. central air live older unit hand built landlord. window units. there's 1 bedroom can't seperate unfortunately. 

Luckily I'm sicker one there's less worry gets it. bad far. think govs labs make sooner. People really want vaccine dont care aproval steps missing. Presion start influence decisions .. cases heard of?

Because would somehow think would huge flood cashiers infected, right?

But seems case. virus mysterybox still! makes sense all. think issue reporting whole lCU 100%. found quickly increase ICU capacity since they’ve canceled elective surgery. report true 100% capacity? way doesn’t feel like you’re hearing phrase again, dilutes it’s severity. What’s alternative?

Do absolutely nothing bank hope

Your comment added zilch conversation beacon ridiculousness. Kentucky Things given power places locked bit, strict. think might good idea schools repoen (at point hopefully it’s appropriate safe) batch testing students. could test entire grade time Woke virus lie mask sheep TRUMP 2020 No, never anything worthwhile. But, there's still time turnaround. Instead snide remarks people something, something yourself. feel good it. someone close died it, changes perspective priorities. quick, easy, painless death, all. [Not first Makes wonder statisticians. kind life you’re stuck inside home year? 89, option living life fullest, maybe getting disease would maybe kill - stay inside vaccine came out, I’d probably take chances too.

Also, used heart attack one example. many ways older folks die, pretty. Considering awful ways older people die (cancer, Alzheimer’s, stoke leaves brain damaged, etc), two week respiratory illness doesn’t seem bad. rich systematically fire idiots job, plus blacklist similar roles state. dont get shit USA....or maybe do.....

We cant really get away shutting shit way country run, fact cant afford lose jobs, businesses, etc, economy keep going....no matter what.

Even faced shit pandemic. Christ....
I dont know whats going happen kids get infected bring virus every parent’s home used virus free, wont anymore. Like trojan horse.....

Man fucked Anxiety trauma builds character. least that’s step-dad told surviving depression asking explanation.  New Yorker here. executive order wear masks stores. 3 days local Police Dep said wont respond non-mask wearers cause much. prepared spike fall. dead heat summer? Totally caught surprise. [Average time infection showing symptoms 5 days.]  read study see timeline, first case day 8 still getting new cases day 28

There also doubt rate infection among asymptomatic carriers. conflicting studies right regarding asymptomatic transmission. learned anything watching Chernobyl, Russia treats people like Zap Brannigan treats men fighting kill bots.

Imagine full unironically learn history watching HBO dramas. absolutely pathetic intellectual goblins like go trash nations. teen stepson doesn’t understand basic hygiene, everyone else place risk?

Incredible logic there. Old Navy branded Tasers relevant poem mask still wear gimp mask? Seriously? People habits formed whole lives. takes simple ""I'd love shake hand, social distancing all."" Yes, also read post hard you? 

We know coronaviruses come animals. know actually thousands them.

You really gigantic brain! share me, relevance covid19? really like listen tell COVID19 links posted podcast, coronaviruses like flu, mutations USUALLY influence virus. It’s something uncommon. 

He goes says: mutations come coronaviruses could likely BETTER us viruses usually become deadly infectious. It’s one two.

But keep going, please! 

You really become virologist, maybe could learn you’re stupid.

OR COULD LISTEN LEADING EXPERTS FIELD WORLDWIDE.

Your choice. you, like country filled corona. 

I prefer German approach. wait last possible moment they're forced close schools. Oh sure, that’s whole different reason Starbucks. many people get coffee every day way work, really gets expensive :)  interesting people coronavirus task force super-squad, blame Fauci least. far. social distancing,  wrong people?  Ha ha Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Here's Boston. Lol. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 100% agree.

Let's go get socially-distanced beer, friend. I’m part young people, I’m 22. holy fuck old people need stop worrying much. It’s fucking cold.

Just kidding, I’m mind blown. person choosing social distance, self isolate, go bars know. girlfriend also it, wasn’t informing her, don’t think she’d even know virus. dumb fucking kids getting people killed.  maybe consider anxiety nonsensical

/r/thanksimcured People definitely getting sick again.
And Spain found 5% 60,000 people tested previously infected antibodies.

And anti bodies aren’t staying us long.  suspected months viral load affect symptoms, mode infection.

Individuals directly inhale pathogen experience lung problems immediately short breath, mild cough, fatigue.

Folks ingest pathogen immediate diarrhea unwell/vomiting. 

I agree masks best course action. fewer get lungs better. Holy hell story everything. surprised? People prognosed otherwise, voicing wishful thinking. hypothesis early on. exactly wearing mask continue wear one. mechanism.

May 5, 1789

Now let clear: merely mention purpose historical education, indeed use ""mechanism"" end deal people who, shall say, much give damn common classes.

We go also royally screwed later process, can't say initially get job done.

Just sayin'.

Also, November 20, 1945 - October 1, 1946 damn fine example one personal favorites.

Just remember last one election. I'm hoping becomes relevant again.

They employed ""mechanism"" end several verdicts well. FYI Santa Anna killed around 200 people Alamo.

Just saying. Masks *proven* work, therefore medical community -- long history trying get rid quacks selling poison -- refused endorse them.

We got right, eventually. understand initial position.  tossing moral values name bigger profits, it’s American way!  nothing virus, fed given money security worried.

Edit since people can't bothered read article.

""The overarching concern time table,” Williams said. “The bits pieces front today something support.” Williams said department’s responsibility “what’s happening outside fence” convention, given late changes uncertainty, still signed contracts would create infrastructure necessary provide security large, high-profile event. “Any plan requires finances resources. don’t need keep community safe, “Williams said.""

I get it. Probably caught bunch flak conservative population Facebook shit realized going lose money. Stayed Hyatt work June breakfast (which fine trusted anyways). Biggest thing noticed lack staff... spoke guy front desk said majority staff laid rehired week. working front desk, cleaning towels, delivering stuff rooms. hotel industry definitely hurting. you’re science denier probably shitty person you’re upset activist  LinkedIn premium way expensive. Plus, added features great. Welcome reality planet. I've factory hundreds, wearing masks. bring virus home half people live likely die it.  'Rules thee, me' seems motto many. people could stop breathing every seconds. Sun, heat, etc none stops virus particle floating onto one's mouth, eye, etc. (even masked, easily go one's eye agree this. keep seeing parents saying kids NEED school ""mental health"" Interestingly, one seemed passionate mental health making mad see people pull card reason schools need open person learning. manipulative gross. kind situation people seriously think they're sending kids back that's going good mental health? get close, touch that, we're closing down, we're reopening, get close friends, sing, cafeteria, band, sports, masks, etc etc. feel like many people using mental health excuse ones saying manicures haircuts ""essential"" mental health. Kids adaptable, yes, needs least little consistency time adapt. Sending everyone back almost plan ""learn go"" approach consistent, part approach going mean people get sick. Certain things work effective way they'll know people start getting sick. seems like high price pay poorly made plans.

I'm also concerned something seen mentioned much that's happen schools, miracle, successful stay open strict measures proposed. Everyone remembers March/early April. Everyone full speed ahead, together. Musicians playing outside, distanced birthday parties social media, clapping healthcare workers night, name it. people got tired stuff stopped. cute trendy anymore staying home. Well, happens attitude wears school? Strict guidelines get looser. Kids, naturally, sit closer closer together. Teachers exhausted constant reminders start issuing less frequently. Everything becomes lax. we've seen US, conducive controlling spread. people got tired three weeks lockdown measures. school year nine months. treat like workplace injury. courts looks determines company cause employee negligence. He's gonna keep calling China Flu debates, goad Joe Biden calling it.

Just watch. he's gonna paint Joe Biden ""a defender China"". Neo-liberal twitter goes nutz.

If Joe Biden ignores it, he's complicit racism, woke Twitter goes nutz.

Lose lose.

That's tactic. get attitude. one forcing work disney gunpoint. thousands, maybe tens thousands companies orlando metro area.

There's enforcement besides businesses care live. really sad tbh defense, seems best work people never diagnosed first place. Don’t get news TikTok. Don’t listen apocalyptic weirdos Here's part faced bullying raising concerns denied PPE ""as punishment"" enforce mask policy RA?!? insane. former RA current RA, good luck stay healthy.

in words ben finegold ""very suspicious"" five Bloomberg articles posted doom gloom: detect agenda? Democrats opposing either. people talking it.

Unfortunately need choose want children escape abusive homes hours, want people keep dying. pleasant choice make. honoured opportunity give lives make someone else money. heroes capitalism Meant first nations people. One word... RESTURANTS Facebook pumped paid ads propaganda damaging family relationships. feels good use facebook, mean productive healthy.

Especially considering many people get news facebook, needs fixed. becoming detrimental society. feel sorry you. county full anti-mask fundamentalist Karens. It’s like epicenter MO. avoid county like plague (har har). that’s question asked, don’t problem. gets subjective interpretations “quality life,” I’m concerned read somewhere average person comes contact least 32 people given day. local school district 42,000 kids alone returning school. Multiply 42,000 32, that's least 1.3 million people interacted one day. chances covid spreading like wildfire schools open insanely high. covid one disease going spread school year, add whooping cough, flu mix get nice death cocktail. Greatest covid numbers! Back back champions infection rates! Considering BUNCH stores rural low-income areas little competition, makes lot sense. want alienate 90% clientele stores make large part overall store numbers.

Obviously bad idea covid-front least understand they're they're doing. like delayed inevitable. virus care freedoms, society care freedoms either comes collective well being. reason mask wearing political. Would surprise foreigners would look us think, selfish?

Mask fines quarantine fines coming pipeline anyways. wealthy Black Plague, too. got one out, us trying. live high rise building masks mandated would say 50% people still wear mask attempt get elevator me.. it’s infuriating. Like elevator absolute ideal place spread. wear mask 30 seconds! I’ve resorted standing directly front door move someone without mask waiting get on. It’s like dealing toddlers. North Carolina... True misread country , idea violent less stupid. least smart enough guns. exponential growth already stopped. Cases declining. know breathless articles cases start decline.. rise.

Deaths continue rise another week however density really relevant factor (or rather excuse context) majority Asian cities much worse, don't. workplace getting 77,000 cases per day bud.
The workplace USA go south.
They every right, per Canadian law say, ""Fuck that."" Well ia way useful everyone writing petty things internet im sure Canada declining birth rate main motivator immigration keep population numbers generate GDP.
If theyre kids theyre reducing population crunch problem (which developed nations) yeah theyll lose points. Hey look, pseudo-intellectual stupidity.

Wear mask, disease goes away.

Don't wear mask, people get sick.

A China corona would create world circus.

Yeah, shit rhyme! Keep mind results patients experiencing cytokine storm syndrome. Exactly, make comparison well. sideways panhandle swamp us, God awful likes cousin collegues, I'm still learning full extent ordeal today, 12 weeks getting hospitalised. Initially hospital tried downplay severity case mother became clear mild case. idea bad healthcare staff really it, can't easily put frame mind working flat 13 hours moving bed bed, keeping track patients trying desperately work semblance protocol end one poor patients yourself. boggles mind, throw back day day. people spreading conspiracy theory nonsense outside GPO.... road hospital can't. Like ignorant.... Boils blood seeing people choose ignorant face this. awful think Sorry poor grammar. meant started thinking wearing mask good idea three months ago. point wearing mask smart courteous, wearing one 2019. People die time infectious diseases. care fellow humans last year? Again, 1.5 million people world wide died tuberculosis last year... mask? think true - Russia rely FDA (US) EMA (Europe) technically release whenever feel like it. definitely needs testing observation Russia known try first everything. impact contagion, almost 10x increase death rates?

Question you. many died age 50 Sweden? parents constituents well, soon need go work buy food pay rent. That's still lower July 12. noise, rising curve. They'll yeet anti-maskers like yeet groceries cart. Russia’s Health Ministry disputed deputy defense minister’s characterization, saying the vaccine's trials yet ended.

 ⬆️ Important detail fluffy piles cash? Yep sorry kinda misleading title haha, probably quick trigger. added: ""in patients cytokine storm syndrome.""  That’s smart. keep seeing entire families internet going shop together it’s unnecessary. Like I’ve seen mums dads small kid probably choice.  Karmic retribution?  issue remains, apply knowledge? ostracize turn witch-hunt, instead take look might good, everyone's benefit. someone fence underlying reasons medical precautions effectively, reach offer information decide! Let know youre concerned, acknowledge coming from, all, reserve right change minds encounter better information! I've disturbed businesses handled enforcement masks, customers responded. Totally unnecessary. LOT room improvement here, perhaps start making store polices excessively clear, polite, offer complimentary masks! (Even stores responsibility, would probably wonders attitudes consumers employees, seeing country handled part issue embarrassing world stage. Yes, free value want, health others, know better, least, communicate reasonably issue. Conclusion: Concern well being, others concepts convenience! Yes, putting seat-belt might appear inconvenient, cost little compared cost using it! constant barrage negativity buried heads sand stonewalled position matter, rightly wrongly, way conversations gone, almost blame them. Let us find patience living 2020 after-all, lets start talking want see instead don't!   

Fix discourse. That's key making progress VS entrenching conflict.  part training get Americans devalue human life normalize death make acceptable. That's part about. Along hiding actual figures much possible, soon see people able step bodies slow stride months come. Well, maybe bad, good. Germany whole Europe well, huh? Nice. probs.

(Note say Black woman, first WOMAN we're told this) Check study details somewhat agree you, useful media source U.S. likely would covered stimulus checks looked like, expect them, track missing.

Instead remember left wing media non-stop covered delayed Trump wanted sign them, assume right wing media covered Trump god bestowing upon us.

Just one example American society suffers due poisonous partisanship seems coming climax soon. Don’t threaten good time It’ll downvoted cause it’s fucking stupid. Corporatation people I've told. let us sue negligence like everyone else. realize real timeline 5-10 years things like this? psychology term subjects behaving differently know they're watched?

As example, unfair coin lands head 55% time, need probably toss 400 times certain unfair. toss 100 times, might seem fair. comparing 7 treatment arms, enroll 500 patients, can't really say anything.

This study Italian PROTECT study, looks hydroxychloroquine vs nothing, enrolling 2300 patients. doesn’t “need” it. Billionaires like aren’t affected bad PR like average person. Amazon ton bad PR past (remember New York Times report years ago working conditions corporate office?). report couldn’t make change behavior, dont think anything can. Let alone Bezos. Yes. type people go malls 1. pandemic 2. Trump counties automatically fall certain demographic necessarily represent US whole.

In 2020 people shop online, pandemic number increased, still going shopping malls?

This study mask wearing, (inadvertently I'm sure) study mask wearing conservative counties. 

Bad study design. Stated goal met. speaking historical context, usually empires never actually paid atrocities, overtaken someone else equally bad. Power happens build cruelty, always been, statement.

*edit. many votes haha. Ok guys. alternative solutions? triggered votes? Seems like sticking Disney done zero research. idiots. I'll never shop again. Jeff Bezos much fucking money likely doesn’t care people think Lead Paragraphs:

Contact tracing, term that’s news lately, crucial tool controlling spread SARS-CoV-2, novel coronavirus causes COVID-19. depends quick, efficient identification infected individual, followed identification who’ve recently close contact person contacts self-quarantine break chain transmission.

Properly carried out, contact tracing extremely effective. also [extremely battling stealth virus like SARS-CoV-2, especially virus spreading rapidly.

But innovative ways enhance contact tracing. new study, published journal *Nature Medicine*, researchers Australia demonstrate one them: assembling genomic data virus assist contact tracing efforts. so-called genomic surveillance builds idea virus passed person person months, acquire random variations sequence genetic material. unique variations serve distinctive genomic “fingerprints.” true lol apparently quite ignorant crowd you’re saying get free bottle water throw up? [Relevant South Regarding death schools:

There's Facebook post circulating teachers want answers questions go back work. Things like ""how explain class teacher dead"". mean 100 day really isn’t bad compared state months ago right, phrasing misleading, also. say again, would've behaved like countries, exactly admitting wrong, commission review swedish response, made sound like criminal investigation, certainly not. I'll put article shut Wear mask. Ah yes job market super great I'm sure get paid enough comfortable savings leave current job time/money find another one. Covid survivor (I feel bit silly using word survivor, since mildly symptomatic). Everyone family recovered virus days ago. I’m interested volunteering studies, antibodies, plasma, something else. there’s information bloodstream help fight virus want help. filled plasma donor form Red Cross website haven’t heard back. Anywhere else volunteer? last month Utah going overrun. Never happened.


Then Arizons was. Arizona number beds free today 4 weeks ago.

Then Houston going run out. still dipped surge capacity hospitalizations flatlined weeks ago.

So long going keep living delusion hospitals overrun? Didn’t answer that? Leisure business two different things. 
People worst priorities this.  I’ve noticed mention (realistic) expectations skepticism you’re automatically categorised someone who’s fear mongering even pessimistic. funding going religious org, semantics going change that's case religious employees also exempt income taxes paychecks.

Why? Chase bank Millwaukie Good them. would too. *shrug* got voted for. long hours low pay. PPEs. would people sending soldiers battle without bullets? Won’t work. people literally can’t empathize suffering others **actually happens** them. 

Oppress others? Fine. Oppress me? Nooooo

Welfare me? Fine. Welfare others? Noooo

Say want? Fine. BLM protesters? Nooo

Statue Jesus federal property? Fine. Statue Baphomet? Noooo I'm proving point here. believe mask effective preventing spread CV19. That's separate ""hmm ... interesting"" moment, seeing something that's counterintuitive. think mean *dystopian movies*. Ironically, kids safest group coronavirus. everybody fared well coronavirus kids do, coronavirus would called ""common cold"" we'd pandemic. Coincidentally, also native birds eat sheep. myriad factors. probably working terrible hours, increased stress, poor nutrition, lack sleep, increased exposure viral load make susceptible worse case covid. California already anyway states not? ""But nobody tried make argument healed divides."" 

I wish true. Sadly, know people exactly that. people saw Obama ""be end all"" racism. course, many people paying much attention issue, begin with. 

On end, people see open hostility toward Obama part it. see views hostile; instead, saw ""valid critiques."" 

I know aware average American thinks every issue. Still, stances specific subjects easily shown collective inaction indifference, drawn conclusions. understand conclusions opinions facts. aware ""average American"" takes many forms several variations across country. average Oklahoma average Maine, understand that. But, overlying culture average American shares, I'm referring to. 

I never said one dominant majority culture. stating American culture exists. also never said foreign eye would know macro micros culture. used example indicate looking something outside perspective could help us see things might overlook live culture, might seem like ""second nature"" ""common sense"" us. French example red herring. 

I apologize read original post harsh lense, that's came me. 

You right differ views regard exposing issues American history shown us time time seems forget exposures occur decades prior. agree exposing issues make individuals aware, call action sound long. People get tired, people move on. 

Yes, Americans might feel like Trump bottom barrel leadership, still plenty thinks wrong. Exposing issues gives wider audience, whether audience sees problem important entirely different conversation. 


I never said silently pacified certain issues. know issues never understand. try least hear perspective someone within group regarding issue, know might enough fully understand something. know issues care universal expect be. 

My issue situation making known voices used, yet people truly listening. people refuse listen order keep view world intact. notice speaking previous replies. So.. fed public life went search perfect mistress? figured stop cell towers tracking yet? govt already knows even upto thanks Reddit. i'm ready, fill rocket ... $13,384,058,023 worth fuel!?! ay trump ... nonsensical I’m surprised they’re actually going day age. potential backlash worth it? boycott Disney movement gains traction? precious movie franchises could hurt. corporate perspective seems lot risk, potential sales parks extra months worth it? Especially I’m sure many hesitant go first place? You’re close! Many live Disney employee dorms Thank you!! Everyone saying “if it, can’t anything it”

Yes can. Also, it’s feasible everyone (or even majority) “stick them” entire livelihoods families stake here. Everyone wants tell teachers do, one wants understand sometimes hands tied see perspective. Parties legal US. bars currently supposed open parts CA. counting people enough sense party people live with. Clearly people sense, Spain, US. get new one work every day. They're issued, signed for, disposed end day. Hell know manufacturer. US studies designed fail beginning.


Why scientists set experiments notice studies shown good results it, started HCQ early disease progress, precisely needs administered effective.

Yeah, noticed “treatment” biggest effect symptoms mild least quantitative data.

That it’s positive effects found small underpowered, poorly designed studies also noticeable non-ideologues.  ""are"". I'm currently staying Hilton Massachusetts (we're house closings) state mandate says masks required public spaces. Signs posted hotel. think hotel staff enforcing this? That's hell no. People kids running around without masks like crazy. fair, native, used wearing mask literally everywhere outside door. people state excuse either, opinion. observed barista hotel coffee shop blow nose serve person without washing hands (she donned one glove). healthcare I'm hyper-vigilant stuff. Needless say, get coffee there. Nursing one made little coffee maker room.

Edit: cleaning occupied rooms due regulation. bring cleaning supplies. Exactly. means company says produce X number doses given time frame 1/2 X number people. Everyone seems learn glossing fact. I'm way trying sound like downer want keep expectations realistic important *accurate* view we're at. People seem think approved Monday go get Tuesday works. single dangerous place seems indoor bars restaurants. 

I think could manage safe Disneyworld trip, could make sure stay outdoors. July Florida -- that's long time go inside! Problem is, parks run huge costs mean cannot afford closed long. get people angry parks opening up. thise people need work. Otherwise starvation kill them, covid. masks also cut overall viral circulation too? Sometimes even need look. um ??? thing happened Northeast, Maine, Vermont NH shutdown. Residents hard hit states (NY, NJ, CT, MA) fleeing north. handful serious COVID cases enough overwhelm rural hospital 'bout countries world doesnt that? gonna ignore demand America same? Propaganda. Yes this, this.

Trump really us dirty, refused acknowledge it, take seriously, said one needed masks idiots follow refuse wear any. He's still rallies (indoors btw) blaming spikes protests (outdoors wearing masks) didnt suggest ppl drink bleach too?

My favorite speach making ""sacrifices"" economy (ei. Us) vivid flashback Lord Farquad's speach knights ""Some may die, that's sacrifice, I'm willing make."" campaign probably told change course virus response risk blowout come November No, EVERYTHING watch react disaster.  Ah, yes, movie character lives *exactly* long absolutely necessary. public summer 2021, considering initial deployment stages potential hurdles I’m even conservative. believe wearing masks I’m pro-choice. You’re lunatics. maybe even start cancerous process next financial victim. no, can't sort nuanced discussion complexities issue here. r/coronavirus, remember? need lock forever regardless consequences.  Certainly grabbed attention though didn’t it? obit home town recently stated elderly woman died ""natural causes, including covid 19."" get it. mean, want leave brain Bad troll bad know calculations mvps
.  look comment instant floridas numbers drop need specific study source. initial infection dose well-known absolutely new covid thing. Even bacterial infections share lot common properties matter. I’ve heard Kansas City mo schools considering opening Labor Day also. sure rest state though. daughter liberty mo open(they already open summer school).  Get absolutely dumpstered lmao.

Didn't see proof. ""pictures workspace""? seen them? anyone seen them? Thought Word advice, chat shit things know nothing nationalist boy. 

Word advice, grow learn critical thinking. think long list ""sources"" replace facts, bridge russia terrified china. 

China enemy Russia probably Russia got notified pandemic everyone else. Russia also got virus information live virus sample. Russia ask China vaccine cooperation. 

Edit: also hilarious - Russia apparently afraid US, UK Canada combined, afraid China. Geopolitics lvl 99

 sure lick clean crumbs around putins swollen asshole.

You seem fixation theme. Probably projecting again. Also think sounds tough, identifies age. Michigan sad truth is, Disney need reopen Disney World. Disney worth $130B.

In case: Good fucking job covid. problem #1 #2 different compliance rates, even mandated.

If mask compliance \~80% valved N95 mask compliance rate \~50%, normal masks still probably lower total number cases.

Additionally, N95 masks cost \~5-10x cloth masks. Pre-pandemic really issue--N95 masks 2019 cost \~0.60 USD$ each--but currently N95 masks running closer 1-7 USD$ purchased bulk. Without provided them, many families would able afford N95 masks, also lowers compliance rate.

Making matters worse, enough manufacturing capacity make N95 valved masks kind bulk required mass roll out. Unlike cloth masks, N95 mask manufacture cannot done without specialized equipment, adding capacity would take time. Cases come labs, hospitals. related testing levels. Ho ho wife asked opinion subject returning in-person classrooms?

My wife not, says teachers sphere saying thing: Nobody ask teachers.

Full disclosure: wife would return asked. bought face shields extra masks make work. still think would worth risk, nobody asking teachers' spouses. :P Jesus posts psycho. man. white. immigrant.

High risk low reward Football isn’t health-friendly game begin yet people go crazy seemingly don’t mind many concussions brain injuries players get. I’m surprised decision. mean, probably first offense not? That's probably best. overstepped bounds

What mean? goOoOooO GaToRs! Also something like really want several studies replicating it.

I'm frankly sick seeing goddamn drug getting much airtime gave trump money promote causing shit stir (and emoluments breaches boot) Eu close borders control. sure first one, two cents rest:

2. N95 surgical masks designed re-used, people it. Ideally, make rotation system every mask left alone 7 days use, approximately long takes virus die mask surfaces, see research data. Note chart use log scale amount virus decrease exponentially time. inventors N95 mask said believe 3 days passive decontamination would sufficient enough virus would survive infectious dose. Hospital staff putting paper bags de-contaminate, use plastic bags may trap moisture prolong virus lifespan, theoretical limit many times re-used long rubber bands tight. Please also note poorly fitted N95 mask actually offer less protection well fitted surgical mask, see Table 5 relevant research data. N95 masks lot harder fit properly surgical masks, Youtube videos help both.

3. Anti-bacteria wipes always work virus. Always wash fresh produce like fruits vegetables, disinfecting boxes, plastic etc likely unnecessary unless reason believe someone coughed past hour so, otherwise highly unlikely get infected surface. "" opinion, chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough sneeze (within 1–2 h). disagree erring side caution, go extremes justified data. Although periodically disinfecting surfaces use gloves reasonable precautions especially hospitals, believe fomites contact infected carrier many hours pose measurable risk transmission non-hospital settings. balanced perspective needed curb excesses become counterproductive. "" opinion piece, backed evidence review article: ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Now, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. said, still opinion meat packages riskier products, meatpacking plants see frequent outbreaks virus stable many weeks refrigerator temperatures. High risk families consider disinfect meat packages, wash hands handling. probably necessary low risk families.

4. encouraging studies possible benefits Vitamin D, Vitamin C melatonin, search r/COVID19/ subreddit relevant studies. findings may invalidated later on, supplements pretty easy purchase health benefits, consider reasonable precaution. exceed recommended dosage without medical guidance. Take care! wear mask close someone want, worry isolating get sick, mask wear, making sure much healthy immune system possibly can, keeping healthy way? wear COVID magically go away? Nothing else make difference?

You see dumb sounds? debate, debating one?  want come insensitive, trying help. serious mental health problems, too, btw. I've trying let go everything. times world limited. I'm saying anything, course God's sake everything steer mom healthy direction take care health. kind let go everything time. Man even know I'm talking quite honest. whole situation insane. little closer heaven. city asked VOLUNTEERS enforce mask ordinance. can't even get people wear mask, let alone install new AC unit! aim low. credential required. common sense, crazy. blessed day Uhhh ... ok then; always impression strive least degree better societies bit bit, try learn history; hence anyone even gives crap immoral concepts like slavery, genocide racism, todays people western countries shudder thought attrocities .... 

To break simple question: 

Do think US (or west i.g.) committed/concerned better societies compared old powers past like f.e. Assyrians, Romans Mongols not?! There's thing ethics Germany. Remember World War 2? future husband children feel way. :-) could go back work cohesive strong national response like every civilized country. no, issue became immediately politicized Trump afraid acknowledging reality would damage stock market. due ineptitude we’re going much much worse economic downturn we’re position described. I'm sorry mom. mom also works disney still furloughed. three years retiring afraid lose job covid made unneeded. R-E-A-D-I-N-G. It’s amazing learn. Yep, that’s certainly trade You’re getting downvoted comment irrelevant. Covid-19 isn’t “common cold.” It’s killing people considerably flu. People “survive” suffering ARDS, blood clotting, loss limbs, “Swiss cheese lungs,” short term effects. idea fucked patients long term.

If HIV/AIDS Ebola didn’t kill people, we’d call “common cold,” too, that’s reality. die job die Darkseid. *nice*  state government Texas complete embarrassment. count many patients sent states? people like make hope children make lives living hell, also growing realize parents aint shit expect billionaires millionaires get end year, leaving rest us suffer made. love taste boot leather. hypocritically go tyrannical government reach (like asked wear mask public) actual tyranny authoritarianism love. 
E.g.: ""Black man dead listened cops."" certain point longer cognitive bais. certain point becomes profound mental issues. Since wise please tell decision guarantee security? point that's want. sure hell college. would get information TikTok? must thin notebook. entire subreddit nothing fearmongering. seen comment sections? XD chairman company approved ChadOx1 stated vaccine likely could available September. thought caution realism first point it’s getting ridiculous. Part difference test-positivity, well differences population thus per-capita rates infection. California definitely experiencing surge cases, deaths. test-positivity rate stayed 10% consistently (as far I'm aware), sort unofficial (and sometimes official) crises-point marker. 

FL, TX, AZ, contrast, really silver lining point to. smaller population CA, exception AZ, larger increases cases times frightening test-positivity rates. AZ numbers lower absolute terms, AZ around 7 million people - versus 40 million CA. per-capita infections way higher. fine! oh wonderful day! massive long term effects mental health academic skills children. doesnt mean schools shouldnt closed kids going alright all. fiance this. gone living life like normal throughout pandemic. flying twice week literally forced stop. moment businesses started reopening, friends restaurants, ice cream parlors, gyms, etc. even got tattoo within week stay home order lifted. literally done anything everything, excess, actively prevented doing. nurse, course listens nobody COVID knows better everyone. Even now, friends.

And less stuck risk, everything personally doing, **only** source risk outside grocery shopping twice month. horrible situation. can't afford stay somewhere else still pay bills here, time, moving would irreparably damage relationship, that's acceptable outcome me. choice accept risk. really sucks. Yeah, one biggest tragedies this. Texas WAY past point return state going normal day-to-day business ignoring infectiins deaths.  *do* know safety. Phase 1 safety testing. Phase 3 efficacy. 70% participants phase 1 fever headache. severe side effects. Yes. America. 

How old you? even getting “facts” from? 5th grade history textbook rural Texas schoolhouse? 

Anyone half brain access actual academic sources knows American women employed outside home since colonial times. 

The time significant numbers women stayed home kept house post-WWII economy booming. And, even then, still mostly rich white women. POC working class, uh, *worked* living. Kids helped family business, worked jobs, sent “school”, usually local old lady taught “three R’s”.

In colonial times, infants literally swaddled tight *hung wall* close keep harms way women working. kid not. worked colonial estate/museum studied first-hand primary sources, written hand people lived time, said did. Kohls open Colorado. department stores still closed? point keeps spewed over. It’s almost August. know different. It’s going 2073 people still saying “bUt FaUcI LiEd”. Enough. Let’s talk know put goddamned mask. sheep told get lives, ""it is"". BAA! hospitalizations still lagging indicator 15 days ago infections 10 days ago tests Correction, good sir/ma'am. `pro-birth` way.  keep seeing numbers like Look closed cases compared total deaths. article post says &lt;.1% - 4%

I understand get numbers... Sun Herald's us link click, like originally mentioned, like mentioned local. Plenty local news stations cover things state due relatively near state line. never assume article covering state paper based in, like assume city based in. Reading us link verify location specific article, gives possible context. Add fact local coverage equal local exposure, even intent. 

There excuse give precise locations every article. Take example, based #197 size viewing area 210 Designated Media Markets. Amazingly, foresight put locations every article, even though they're local exposure local get. random viewing area station pulled bottom viewing area rankings. difficult. Really sounds like 2 yo tantrum. mainly kills old people, doubt people live Texas worried. fly number European countries, stay quarantine 14 days please. 

For example, UK, Croatia Micky got billz mom like -- luckily dad still sane never buy politics general. simply refuse talk politics. starts ranting I'll get walk away. could absolutely trusted. I'm 15 minutes Disney people still mask hand here. stay fck away NZ Yeah, ...?  Edit: wrong response! Well great, dying streets ongoing wars waging unless Seattle. decision free choice still make wish go wish. feels like exact situation people saying need 2A for, literal secret police kidnapping people. good news Arizona cases hospitalizations seems flattening. Large part due deaths unfortunately. number discharged patients going down. join? tl;dr: teens get infected, might get sick, infect family, someone love might die.

I understand hard article say clearly beginning, instead going blah blah blah 1700 words. Well, charge state? trying downplay going on. Covered lice trying point nit lice yet. pitiful. I've blessed able save lot larger UE checks. I'm fine right many lucky. using situation example possible future open everything going away loooong time.

I appreciate concern though &lt;3 Plus angry women considered funny nobody finds intimidating. Angry men however scary funny. Dollar general good frozen Chinese, pinch

Edit Dollar tree meant Close. The. Park. Florida already one worst places COVID I’m sure keeping Disney open helping 19.8%. testing down.. cases. right front face still dont see it. kind calls us sheep.. one wool eyes. ""And suffer post viral problems possibly rest lives, that's problem."" insane me, people obviously put enough value education, else would argue masks. people want us go back suddenly value education? I'm worried going wind students thinking big deal, would put school dangerous? Rebellion long after. need education, watered free childcare people want back right now. love attitude, thank 90,000 pounds lying around? Telling people world going end lucrative business. father somewhat retired, drives school bus county. attended ""safety meeting"" last week. First order business respectively sanitize clean buses. dad said guy came bucket Lysol wipes. gave dad *one wipe* clean inside bus. looks says, ""Really?

That's little communist liking. Places ubi extreme tax rates something realistic America. brave adults volunteer players team members die damaged longterm entertainment finances.  


Truly hardest choice. Yeah never thought weird pledge years ago. kid even think Yeah get takes long time normally. However recently I've seen Oxford team saying might vaccine September. confusing. One team take 1+ years, one done 2 months. gives? Same, even though ever went birthday cards gift wrap Exactly, sharing details people selected, cross sectional demographics are, whether front line workers, etc etc know helped change medical care 
HIV. involved knew caused AIDS.

He hasn’t wrong. don’t seem want know truth troll here. Unfortunately without better system place, it’s send kids school job least one parent. makes keeping kids home unattainable solution. needed better support citizens COVID hit. Fake News! Andorra San Marino really shit bed, would put US third worst response. /s   literally neighbor ask “who’s dying?” day, said “over 130,000 Americans” response was, “yeah, old ones die anyway.” reference, woman mid 50’s, shock one, die hard Christian. Everything said correct.

Go look up. way happened one thing actually distinguish American dream absolutely stratospheric upper bound wealth make - limits access kind wealth make pipe dream vast majority people. Unless starting wealth one handful people actually create wealth nothing lifetime, really keep people making changes would improve lives. Actually, [the average time symptom onset death 18.5 people ssstttrrreettcchhiinnggg purposes debate. junk mails include non activated credit cards. feeling card effect. I've never even heard credit card company sending junk mail without non activated card included.  think that's probably classification we're heading towards, tbh. We're fucked..... Great point. Hebrews/Jews pretty big spreading disease neighbors. rules one rules it. Jesus cultural standpoint would probably pretty viscerally skeeved general lack pandemic hygiene people displaying Exactly, people act like billionaires subject customs enforcement. not. Given Trump done, I'll take ""not making things worse."" chia-pet would acceptable (and better hair.) studies around poor underpowered, welcome novel virus early on. one showed dangerous ineffective already retracted. scientists set experiments fail?

Probably push remdesivir shown similar effectiveness (or lack thereof) costs 100x much. mean, tell would take drug use 60+ years start administering late disease progress excessive dosages? I'm legitimately curious there's medical reason I'm aware of, seems like going far beyond known safe dosages is...not logical all? recall California governor calling news fake alarmist month ago, demand apology them.

Florida getting desserts showing iota sympathy NY, sells. Damn, american chains closing re-opening closing again, going make minds? Masks make less people sick, hard. question.

So, keep hearing people say children less likely spread Covid 19 adults are, think accurate.

I've heard explanation seem affected less, means they're less likely spread it. agree logic. I'm mistaken children get infected rate less severe symptoms likely asymptomatic.

 Children generally good understanding germ theory good self control. Children infamous vector spread infectious diseases. touch *everything* many put hand pencils mouths. mention packed overcrowded schools exacerbate things.

Is something I'm getting, idea children somehow spread Covid 19 less, simply false?

Edit: grammar democratic country devolving fascist oligarchy fascists using mechanisms government kidnap people hold onto power think civil duty remove fascists power. 

We keep going crisis crisis hoping institutions deal it, senate abdicated duty protecting fascists government, keep delaying courts actively attempting sabotage election seemingly trying keep virus around long possible. 

What tries call election, put federal agents democratic districts either intimidate straight kidnap people trying vote? want hear ""that happen"" past 3.5 years ""that happen somebody stop him"" fucking nobody continue break law violate civil rights. problem murdered, god's time go. odd sentiment. Hospitalization trends continue show good news Arizona. However, think it’s important realize we’re trending insanely high levels still lot Covid there. time become lax.

I’ve lived almost decade. huge difference summer winter spent terms big gatherings. Outdoor festivals almost every weekend. People outside beaches lakes. Drinking eating outside summer. Everything inside winter like 6 months. OP's article: ""Employees said asked work getting test results virus, least one case, employee told I-Team asked work testing positive.""

We can't give immunity facilities run like this. Folks blaming visitors going Disney World. But, like Disney World open. Especially state dealing worst Covid outbreak.

A lot people lack self control. really excuse selfish actions going Disney World, precautions taken higher level help avoid Mouse temptation.

Feel like sort like drug dealer giving client powerful stuff overdose die. Except case, caught, drug dealer would punished. excuse ""*They're providing service, chose overdose.*"" really hold up. somehow Disney. people graduate college? Since when? Also like said ""look"" safe job find any.

That's time work this, talk herd immunity needs take account idea long natural immunity lasts, 3 months? 8? know.

That said, there's nothing encouraging people getting virus. You’re doomed.

"" Passengers China-bound flights must provide negative COVID-19 test results boarding, China’s aviation authority said Tuesday ""

It's good idea. rule aviation everywhere (especially international travel) Covid gone. don’t think anyone take health advice someone looks like chose poorly picking correct holy grail. I’m sure that. Look what’s happening Portland. We’re verge fascist regime. Don’t think United States immune ever happening. probably wont get virus probably wont die. Nothing brave it. live apathy towards much likely threats. Whatever get won’t fix.

These “vaccines” bandaids right now.

We won’t anything truly effective long time. companies trying first one put something shows positive results.

Moderna never anything approved. keep mind. modernas study’s aren’t thorough information available us online I’ve read.

They gonna rush fix us bad side effects. Don’t surprised make us sign waivers saying get super sick die families can’t sue them.

They already talked waivers like that. people muli millionaire parents spend penny help others. diminish selfless actions comes wealthy background. divide number deaths estimated mortality rate get range approximate infections.

Most estimates place mortality rate somewhere 0.6% 0.25%. However range dropping since pandemic began I’d say something lower end would provide better estimate. Good point. Disney plus help. makes money. Well knows many doses already currently produced big batch is. I'm going take guess number doses available September 10s millions more. Nobody works AstraZeneca, really knows. That's exactly Mitch's goal. Americans sacrificed upon altar Mammon.  no, people build homes provide shelter.

Thank you! try make best situations. figure we'll wearing awhile, might well fun it. I've also told customers make another accessory? There's many designs now, express yourself.  true places go pretty good compliance, would say bit stretch say people wearing masks.

Grocery stores home improvement stores big ones see 90%+ compliance.  really go anywhere else except work downtown, I'm ever within 50 feet anyone office.  50% people even walking around outside downtown wearing masks, anywhere go food pickup downtown 100%.

There's probably indoor places people gather worse numbers.  But, anybody places see part problem too, I'm sure people best positioned throw around moral blame.

I hear governors states literally making illegal cities even impose mask requirements. governor, Republican be, least wears mask about.  Huge parts U.S. mask requirements all.  annoys bit Boise get shit actually mask requirement, which, least, almost fully complied grocery stores home improvement stores.  (I'll exclude Winco, go there, imagine compliance may less others, certainly less staff enforce anything).  I'm 2 blocks co-op right now, I'd bet amount money compliance literally 100%. Albertson's right street State I'd bet around 90%.

Some better mask-wise, worse Boise. saddening choice work contagious environment seem care. prison first place. agree you. want see mandate. 

There’s reason selfishness can’t places like South Korea New Zealand done. guess testing causes Covid /s tourists flooding sure loving freedoms here. Even vigilant counties cities trying be. different position mine travel bans? Time means nothing I've unemployed since April lol.

With money? add ink FED'S printers? 4 1? 20 gets 80? shit thats true well personally don’t think we’ll see vaccine late 2021 earliest mid 2022 realistic target don’t think vaccine going end virus even see promising results one phase III trials. 

The original sin pandemic never implemented rapid testing capacity countries implemented. Trump unambiguous fact trying hinder effort expand testing without data, it’s hard understand exactly bad situation thus it’s hard estimate might see end. know certain take competent, coordinate federal response put dent community spread we’re seeing now— means providing fiscal aid states simply don’t budgets deal disaster mandating lockdowns businesses, mask requirements nation wide. long gradient strictness regulations set up, infection continue jump one hotspot next. 

So basically we’re fucked unless democrats manage win executive senate even then, probably take another year things become manageable approach normalcy. we’re able reduce level community spread point engage effective contact tracing, able open again. We’ve never hit point blowing March. 

So recap, we’ll probably see “effective enough” vaccine sometime 2021 2022 that’s going end virus it’s never realistic solution ending COVID-19, it’s another tool help. reality see second wave (and there’s reason believe won’t), probably seasonal occurrence appears reservoirs bats. parties held responsible. People responsible enough go giant amusement park historical pandemic, people running business responsible enough pay employees stipend remain closed.

Transportation barriers, cost barriers, time barriers common. states allow replace forms ID online. go physical location often open business hours. Many homeless people working cannot take time off. COVID impacted access government institutions.

And lot IDs mailed you. driver's license example state.

If homeless - get mail?

Lastly, [you need ID get cannot show up, insist Jane Doe. need establish identity.

This biggest challenge.

When homeless, sometimes wallet stolen, lose everything. becomes virtually impossible establish identification.

But reading lines trial direct Oxford releases, timeline expecting:

1. Results Sept Nov phase 3 registration.
2. Small roll vaccines (50 - 500 million) end year, full production end 2021. Production independent phase 3 registration unless big holdup there.
3. Early mid 2021 ramping production.

For vaccines potentially released western markets, likely 1 - 3 months behind Oxford. I'd looking late 2020 phase 3 results early mid 2021 first real production.

Full eradication could possible, said measles. Unless virus really stable vaccination wipes out, I'd expect around number years like influences nasty uncle, especially poor uptake vaccine.

I hope timeline short enough keep people focused far away make people give up.

Stay safe! anything comes this, it’s GOP delivered proof concept America’s government huge fatal flaws. Checks balances don’t always work. Trump almost entirely unchecked—almost dictator already. Oh shit, we're list. mouse requires live sacrifice Like others said, can’t time market. would never advocate pulling money hard times, fact retirement in, playing around speculations going rough bit. I'm expert meta-science term ""meta-scientist"" setting meta-bullshit-alarm  “All us got sick, county didn’t anything help us.” 

Merced County CA agreed employ 42 contact tracers part agreement reopen faster. Weeks reopening request granted, abandoned contact tracing, reasoning ""too many cases."" Absolutely horrifying. &amp;#x200B;

Always wonder would break first doors, hinges holding door frame 2x4 chain. wondering too. pass get emails. googling. think called vested interest.   Often, inventor spend time project think work. Sometimes think work long enough invested lot time, money work see way something impossible.  Faced facts continue throw money time rather move on.  Developers lot starting business. Everyone country treated valuable human life worth saving. need competent leader put clear, concise guidelines social distancing enforced. Right now, Trump administration literally blocking coronavirus aid Congress agrees give businesses zero liability coronavirus transmission. could using money pay provide mandatory grocery retail pickup would reduce spread grocery retail stores. healthcare workers, could giving money resources need obtain equipment protect (since many reuse masks create makeshift masks) instead _actively blocking_ money. top that, tweets! tweeted ""Liberate Virginia. 2nd amendment seige"" coronavirus protests Virginia, Michigan Minnesota. words leader sending consistent, clear message safe responsible. point is, bad. gotten better countries (like UK); gotten _worse_ us. valid reason knew back May. stalled 2 months. 

They still could release Phase 3 data. not. stock piled 90million it.. saw something bro, massive faith Oxford.
I truly think know phase 3 passed won’t tell us simply nation start give even less fuck.

Which fair bottle popping time considering scientist article said 95% failing phase 3..

Please feel free tag anything future fails gets pushed back whatever I’m curious thought death rates per captia low except NY Governor personally kill nursing home residents?

Ugh. yelled please leave come dude. want stranger face getting groceries even wearing mask?! well postponed due coronavirus well said. Yeah could quite dramatic change r number even 30% immunity. I'll hunker long to. matter far away is, relief know estimate long there's vaccine. One day time we'll get this. I've always thought Yersinia would beautiful name girl. Testing maxed out. Yet positivity rate increasing.

Not sure keep downplaying hopeless attempt make America look better. Amen that. stand, looks like Sweden bet vaccine taking longer develop, chose strategy accordingly. reality seems vaccine coming along record speed, though. 17, 2020 Considering house alone fluctuates $1m-$4m depending real estate market, net value least that. funny, I've never seen house fluctuate much value often... always times pressure FEC look too. Bizzare.


You realize basically excusing corruption one individual ""well bad."" mentality government shitter begin with. Stop making excuses terrible people. think understand comes corruption elected representatives dollar amounts irrelevant regardless order magnitude. out, end story. stop trying take away guns regular folks. founded genocidal, religious fanatics. much changed. thought tracing better cases falling. Except maybe work school. Shes tough time reading cue cards dad wrote behind camera. course donated money foundation 🤣🤣 certain that, especially this, 80%+ people idea Antibody 95% people idea Cell is. what? literally stated something make sense relation conversation. ""no"" that.

It way encourages behavior states facts. non expert ""beliefs"" better facts want positive. False dates help. come around people realize wrong lose trust. I'm guilty that, admit it. Covfefe words one says that. protest stupidity saying 'look corona does'. 'muscles' would disappear even stayed home time. nothing corona practically. 

i hate scaremongering media. do. world enough that. article that. i'm sorry people downvoted, ate either stupid afraid.

otherwise, sorry story bro, get it. mean? I'm also TN, website nothing. Ive also reported workplace, gf's workplace violating mask orders, R state dude. one cares Surfaces thing

From recall reading, fomites primary source transmission. real truth is, feels bad us. made comment claiming psychiatrist treating transgendered patients, months later claimed ER physician. it?

Hard explain mean. used work Disney (actually woman used picture) love Disney family anyone going right fuck right off. irresponsible selfish people Still alive? hospitals doctors need sensationalize everything? None hospitals ever collapsed. started Phase 3 UK April. 

They said would know June efficacy correct.

As June approached changed tune.

In mean time AZ getting billions governments non-profits.


June came went.

They said ""Oh well virus disappearing UK need Phase 3 again"".


So moved Brazil South Africa.

It's almsot August even discussing Phase 3 data.


AZ like 1st 2nd largest Pharma company. said would start Phase 3 US. not. Moderna company 0 product ever approved able get Phase 3 started. AZ (I stand corrected) even set date appears moving slowly.


They said ""We get September/October"".

Well getting close they've moved goal post ""Late 2020"".


It's hard tell think Phase 3 mostly failed. probably show much terms efficacy. need move hot zones get clinical significant result save face justify billions handouts. Plug two holes, three holes appear.  First - sound awesome!

Hope recover full fast. children. 

Wish best “Find something new!” - ivanka efficacy questions that. Trust me, get really frustrated people secretly call names. friends also runners, social media filled pictures getting together run groups. Yes, outside transmission risk low, zero. pictures bunched together pose, even pretending distance. masks visible photos, they're around people's necks smile big camera. see photos meal someone's house afterwards saying #sociallydistant (not) similar nonsense. infuriating.

Meanwhile run friends since early March. Every single day myself, used run groups 4+ times week. runner, *not* want get potentially deal long term reduced lung function would put real damper one favorite hobbies. importantly, want position knowing gave someone else might rougher time even die.

Many friends running club conservative, I'm terribly surprised reckless behavior anti-mask rhetoric social media. disappointing surprising. really frustrates closer friends tend much liberal, pro-mask, pro-distancing, etc. yet they're things!! ""Oh, small group, ok. I'm lonely running myself, miss friends, ok!"" SB county getting worse. Ugh. that's Serbian man Hi bb. baseball? Fauci throwing first pitch. 

Get doomed gloomed media :) believe chronic fatigue syndrome. I'm doctor, definitely contact one. claim psychiatrist one comment, less three months later claim ER physician. likely either, trying spread misinformation favorite sub gone.  feel like got challenged courts hold. that's probably vestigial belief right prevailing beforetimes.

Either professional org big fundraisers night. No, people entire South/South-Eastern US things. 

70-80% compliance enough, happening big parts US - closer 20%. 20% voluntary certain governors evil enough put politics lives actively fight cities municipalities implementing simple rules.

Masks distancing lockdowns, people keep working. &lt;1,000 deaths entire (very dense, highly populated) Japan, brief lockdown. Everyone wore mask keeps wearing it. how.

What European countries mention? low-mask early measures + tracing countries (Fenno-Scandia minus Sweden), high-mask no-tracing countries like Czechia Slovakia. Germany uses strategies, intermediate-mask heavy tracing early response (similar Canada). Italy, Spain, France went full mask tens thousands deaths taught to. ""some may die"" Sweden UK, exception.

Most importantly, comparing death rates countries epidemic already controlled US full swing shows sign slowing.

Controlling epidemic wearing masks much doable, even US already 1918 (in parallel war less). new retardation excuse. Dunno heard Flair never stroke. however hospitalised heart kidney problems recent years Explain pls Ignorant, selfish, arrogant; pure simple. guise “my rights”. virus burned densely populated cities first states. didn’t anything “turn numbers around”. stopping virus without vaccine. slow spread social distancing/masks hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. people still going die. likely though massive priorization among first recipeitns vaccies, probbaly frontlien healthworkers first

Correct I'm wrong thought herd immunity really established/effective came vaccine? (I could totally wrong, thought remember reading somewhere.) No, kinda hot accepted role camel's sub. Assuming linear infection rate...looks super-linear right heading towards exponential unless things change dramatically quick. Knowing limits knowledge understanding smart thing able do. learned quite quickly life able pronounce chemical names makes people think smart. beginning loss faith people.  Considering we've increased 50% cases past 2 weeks (at 45k now) really surprising. support another shutdown real question. suspect current administration care trying leverage ending unemployment bonuses order force people outside (just like tried ban international students schools without in-person classes).

LA Stats : get paid interns nothing? Like one they're gonna sit pay them. Edit: disregard Excited see Maine using preferential ballot. understand point able socially distance forever... seeing anti mask? seems inexcusable. masks? (Genuine question)  5,000 dead already FL real signs slowing down. Florida stubborn fuck behave comes masks social distancing. Combine idiot DeSantis charge perfect shit storm. 

Schools reopen soon September beast going rampage entire country morons charge made political thing. 

All countries put science front politics vastly better are.  embarrassed hell egos arrogance ignorance put us starting White House going way civilian population. Yeah get it. feel selfish go around corner gas station buy beer. like, really need this? No, least keeping inside playing video games. Invaded country. point second amendment? works some, all. 

I use Apollo/Safari iOS. 97% aren’t. garbage in, garbage terms confirmed cases, close New York terms actual cases based antibodies test. said pile poo would better leader WRT covid current leadership. tend agree. many cases leadership actively working medical scientific establishment recommending. making problem worse. problem actually that's ""One voice, one message""  rather leadership effectively working make problem worse. Let's clear, unified top message, ala dictatorship, things would even worse now.  

For political problems, governments like China ALSO actively embrace medicine science, great job handling types crises.

I would say root problem governmental type three things.

a) resources commitment make happen 

and

b) belief science medicine actually work.

and

c) policy position intended actively improve things. 

In US we're currently lacking three administration.

a) administration actively blocking funding testing. ?

b) administration actively promoting quack cures like bleach, light, even hydroquinone studies done. 

c) see #a. perhaps #b.

If healthy functioning democracy, autocratic dictatorship, could go either way. 

A key thing science outliers, need actively try update model/hypothese account these. Science disproving theories. Outliers super important they're often showing theory wrong. DeSantis certify results marching capital. Uh, every single case new high? Extended unemployment benefits end cases peaking red/swing states. wonder republicans trying actually destroy themselves.  Yea, pcsos hobby bobbies arent really thinking. Actual real police officers, ones know community aswell, perhaps I'm thinking bygone age! Wow think 2 weeks ago 3 million cases. Data years: 481 cases Data years: 237 cases 

Finland half population. 1/2 * 481 = 240. numbers verify report. Get head backside realize politicizing major health crisis pointless politically driven garbage. talking government controlling all. We're talking government controlling public health catastrophe. Good thing. Gooood thing. Oh sorry, bad,  politifact article referring to? Cite damned source. Things like I'm happy follow educator. 

See, can't say ""look Wikipedia man sources"" Correct I'm wrong, assuming increase remains exponential, expect total infection population couple weeks? said thing. study shows people socially distance, wear masks wash hands measures alone prevent large epidemic efficacy exceeds 50%.  agree pretty ignorant selfish assume force people wear masks. 

Have fun scared! I’ll say this. terrified get this. severe heart condition I’m 40. Turns fever twelve hours, felt like crap four days, loss sense smell taste Thursday. that, I’m perfectly fine. 

I’m going quarantine next two weeks anyway sure can’t spread it. I’m really happy come intact. don’t terrified. 150,000 preventable. Look Canada. get news, lucky forest trump leader. tl;dr: Hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing every new infection every country new high?  novel coronavirus afterall. Actually, looked up. right. They're $10-12 billion pop. bad. B-b-but muh freedom! There's graphic article states 1 10 Covid patients suffers severe long-term effects.

There's citation though, certainly see way could sure statistic given long-term yet see. could say least 1 10 experience lasting severe effects ""recovering"". There's like 1 elderly person per day dying covid entire state Kansas. 

I call outbreak, problem, anything even think about. 

Wtf wrong people? misspelled toddlers. already sucks! joke. failure. see works HIV, Corona? tired bed. Get sleep feel better think people get mentally prepared go work knowing could die thanks get people internet whining like seeing get hysterical. Gotcha. Yeah understand original rationale, consider people selfish would violate non-essential travel orders 3 days tomorrow. hear lot too. tell you’re probably right, covid deaths counted non-covid also. either way, mistakes likely account small portion reported deaths, it’s pretty insignificant reported deaths close accurate leadership dumb roomate family lives you? roomates cutting others' hair surprisingly easy. Buy haircutting kit Amazon watch one two youtube videos. Even first tries, results 95% good barber.

If anyone screws up, many people going seeing anyways. Hmm 90k amass that? kids parents end hospitals doctors offices.   don’t recall ever making assertion flu, schools open. saying said technically true purely numbers perspective. Trump says much stupid shit don’t need make stuff. Greta Thunberg brand now. hope guys realize that. Right views seem align what's right selfish capitalism, easily used manipulate large amounts people. prudent Americans totally hung ""freedom"" thing. continually obsess preserving ""freedom"", means really real freedom, worrying time. 

Just opinion. Without empathy, Americans call, ""freedom"" like, ""screw you, I'm ok......."". nice way live life. reads though confident able get results want two going run trials two get approval ASAP explore results attained one dose lower doses...rather test one lower doses risk start trials again. Thank you! much prefer data headlines. care worked : ) leading expert infectious diseases. ridiculous. 75%? USA would still largest military word 1.01 - 1.13 today. Cool, tell Florida Wow. dumb af. threaten good time. poised hate other. working fantastically well. thought too, honestly Main Street Wall Street far divided don’t think risk implosion October. I'm sorry, we've already given away Rush Limbaugh. She'll accept federal prison instead. rhe ""experts"" predicted 500,000 deaths UK start May? I'm expecting everything totally back normal Christmas, top statements (years, decades etc) like ones article help anyone children learn accountable actions. terms probation.  Mississippi’s overall per capita deaths higher spiking states like Arizona, Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, etc name few. Interesting 🤔 hope start taking seriously. It’s actually helping people, it’s keeping spin CNN completely biased fake news forefront mind. 

Very frustrating spin current events match narrative (Fox, oan, etc) unlike civil unrest (We lose city Portland! There’s much violence! See news clips piece together photoshop scare viewers) virus doesn’t really give shit continue spread kill regardless. 

As much people love point fingers one country failures one state impact others - either taking additional resources, spreading cases hotspots, maintaining high transmission cases banned international travel. 200 years? corpses catch measles antiboides? appropriate conditions Debbie Downer, know is.

One person 19 died Sweden. **One**, Uno, un, 1, eine. Yes! This! There’s kinds ways fudge data control it. places laws attending school break them, parents face jail time and/or fines. Thank proving point. article posted clearly shows, ""actions"" resulted absolutely nothing changing. 

Nothing. 

No new law, regulations, factories closing, power plants changed renewable energy, nothing. 

Absolutely nothing. one single accomplishment. local discount store, mask mandate went effect, announced require them. backlash swift, retract statement hours later, next day put commercial saying everyone's safety masks required. Hopefully happens stores. NY nursing hooooommmesss!!!!!!! /s People die time, absolutely something far dangerous like .0001% kids dying. Longterm economic social crippling would result WAY deaths. say incoming kindergarten class, double population they've held back? parents can't work put food table home kids? kids kill fall deep depression year without able see friends? virus control months vaccine, could years off. Fact can't assume control reasonable amount time, immense damage year school really can't understated. pediatric association agrees - kids need back school.  problem mind slowly numbers go (or maybe feels way). took NY like 2 months get numbers down. goes even slower going vaccine released. 8? early warnings china started Jan 9th CDC. Thats \~6 months tops. Yes, asthmatic, I’m like 👋 pick me, pick me.

E.g. get diabetes year get COVID vaccine, know COVID vaccine quarantine people ate bag oreos day home? reality never nice don’t understand... I’m Florida, experience people’s behavior may dramatically different people Colorado behave.

Usually people grieve people close them. grieved deaths time would able function human. also fresh trauma happening past 5 months stopped. people still fight flight mode. Grief usually can't fully processed state subsided. think number one factor people generally diligent social distancing particularly hand hygiene; especially true healthcare lesser extent also shops, restaurants others establishments. none late February much March, led uncontrolled exponential spread. would colossal failure spread continue decline levels.

I think number two factor shortly measures caused hospitalizations deaths decline, Summer could meet outdoors. We're traveling socialising much Spring, we're proximity many strangers often outdoors. also summer vacation Swedes, Big Deal Sweden, there's much potential spread workplace.

This good quite worried Fall/Winter. actually perfect storm new, rapid outbreaks. People meet groups almost exclusively indoors, including restaurants, bars establishments (cinemas open then, example). People already starting tire careful, 2-3 months things (hopefully) look better moment restrictions may eased? schools open (and yes, kids spread disease certainly teenagers university-aged adults also get sicker younger children).

TIL. Thanks. Googling gave top: effect aside, double-blind clinical trials medicines. case intervention studied mask. think double blind experiment / trial participant know he/she part trial respect masks? observational, - like comparing figures Asian countries USA.

The one thing mitigating Hawthorne effect people inside tested negative, would make people bit reassured interacting. 

But agree impossible get normal behaviour people trial today. Especially tell use masks.

Maybe really good actors given written assurances everyone negative could pull off. actors observe mimic part job. would introduce biases.

Needless say, LOT close quarters contact HUNDREDS people.

-Our staffing would average 80-120 employees day working 6-10 hour shifts. We'd meet multiple times day small room. EMPLOYEES would meeting. Imagine meeting 79-119 co-workers room that's designed seat 50-60 people. literally times we'd handful employees listening meeting hallway open door, even enough floorspace room stand in. goes breakrooms.

-Everybody expendable position. literally need little experience work position. extremely common employees departments applied extra hours, none available department sent shift two. trust me, anybody food department picked extra shift Parade Audience Control, they're sure bring back department whatever contracted there. also gone 100%

But nothing R-number.

Also, R-number increased too, 1.29. I'll wait say R-number.

Yes did. direct quote. Problem Americans want don’t know scenario here, here’s what’s happening state. Everyone, Governor, health department, employers, President tell people get tested. It’s free. it’s free. National Guard testing centers free, people aren’t able differentiate. everyone saying it’s free, people line up, wait hours get testing event asked insurance card. one wants provide it, it’s supposed free right? one wants give drivers license, going get billed. health department would rather fight drivers license it’s going cause drive away get tested. health department seeing people giving fake information, correct cell phone numbers, get notified test results, bill goes random address. need upfront here. Testing free federal National Guard site. Insurance cover it, don’t insurance, you’ve got problem. probably another lie though. First all, would lying masks protect supplies begin with? masks would protect already stores even wouldn’t effective. 

To really protect supplies they’d need restrict shipments far back January. Fauci lied March. doesn’t really add up.

Usually thanking God opportunity help person asking help said person struggles (may stick requested subjects there) person interested, pray. (Well maybe send good vibes way) Real Christians respectful, job judge, job aid.

But agree Religion probably stay business government. perfectly ok keep shop closed Sundays without declaring Christian company. Ppl get weird... Federal government provide funds states lockdown, that’s point. one proposing states lock say fucking deal people. saying federal government funds support total lockdown, individual states choice lockdown accept funds so, stay open reject funds. federal government choosing fund it. Many countries less money US done it. much possible Hospitals ""collapsing"" mean many patients hospital crumbles ground weight, based comments must understand term.

It means many people care hospital accommodate, absolutely happened. You’re trying put Facebook box commons publisher doesn’t work way. don’t put unrelated box like want to.

It work way. dichotomy exists host speech whether online public. absolutely right ban users tarnish brand. Extreme examples include terrorist recruiting, planning murders, etc many less extreme examples.

This really neither since I’m arguing they’re breaking law. argument freedom speech principle that’s defined law. Arguing censorship isn’t violation freedom speech incorrect whether censorship protected not. people spreading misinformation pandemic could lead many deaths economic destruction qualify? That’s decide personally believe do.

Facebook isn’t qualitied determine isn’t misinformation. Btw comment crazy people screaming shop might actually attract people ridiculous irrelevant.

I said opposite this. think something ridiculous indication may misinterpreted it. next step read carefully. example situation screaming negative, that’s it.

You took situation screaming would likely always negative tried relate situation longer case. That’s made bad comparison. explained comment didn’t really read. Seth Meyers mused would love see Trump count 100 sevens, one questions test. ([This bit talks Trump bragging test Chris Wallace - whole video pretty funny.) True although looking worldometers seems Africa testing much apart South Africa Morocco carried tests. mean without adequate testing know virus spread Vitamin deficiency California summer months definitely issue, another thing viral load higher NY spring due cramped rooms particular case, ultraviolet sunrays destroying viruses reducing total viral load, especially outside

edit: expect get upvoted high, opinion using basic logic mean 100% accurate/correct/the actual/only explanation behind drop deaths, another fact consider often viruses tend evolve less lethal version outcompeted lethal, although unsure relevant case sars-cov-2 since lethal outcompeted lesser strain  Phase trial study showed 90% people developed neutralising anti-bodies one dose. Ten people given 2 doses produced neutralising anti-bodies. 

I agree rest post completely, say 1 shot won’t work misinformation - clearly does, 2 shots better. mean.

This people persuasive.

Downvotes moral judgement.

No long term plan practical solution. 

Why convinced? think long term plan except yelling vaccination might might come.

Contact tracing? Ok really work? think open evidence. Another lockdown people fail imo.

Which fine. 

2 questions:

1: long measures wait vaccination? consider reasonable reasonable?

If indefinitely never going agree.


2: vaccinations fail?

I would say brutal herd immunity.

I convinced contact tracing silver bullet. Especially lockdowns postponed virus real solution. Everything costs U.S.A. crap-ton money matter also costs crap-ton money live. relief package like 2 trillion recall correctly. slashing 732 billion going do? Add another weeks relief?

Honestly, sure relief package ever happened. misused best putting bandaid gaping wound.

If government (which gets money working people) takes care everyone, deincentivize economy necessary government exist first place.

If almost american wants easier life (not working)... work hard bit, save money move poorer country cost living low small nest egg allow cover basic needs many years.

Point being... Large total sums money mean much everything costs large sums money.

Life risk. expect government solve problems. good experiment seriously. tell us lot indoor spaces spread. invest something actually going build better country.

But right. spend money old poor people. Better spend war. Absolutely was. 150K embarrassing. differences comes climate population make Canada little different trying compare US. However, U.S govt also terrible job american public helping prevent spread. Yeah know elephant looks like?? Sounds like seal beach aka Leisure World benefit some, let's real. everyone cut learn code. Longterm economic social crippling would result WAY deaths. 

there's zero evidence either things happen. economy fine. 100% recover time. recover faster get spread virus control. people die suffer virus, longer take economy recover. care economy, focus getting virus control. ruin children socially either. Children resilient adaptable. Even total lockdown means staying contact friends relatives point human history. worried mental health children focus getting spread virus control. Children far impacted death siblings parents sitting ass classroom morning afternoon. say incoming kindergarten class, double population they've held back? 

""Welcome students""? We're richest nation Earth. think handle adding extra teacher/classroom accommodate them. parents can't work put food table home kids?

They getting disaster relief government stay home kids. government fails them, vote office soon possible replace someone support crisis. meantime, need make sacrifices best without support. may mean take extra risks, spend money childcare. virus control months vaccine

It's already control many places vaccine. [Experts say could 2 months masks I'll trust pediatric association agrees - kids need back school. 
 
The American Academy Pediatrics disagrees you, [agree must pursue re-opening way safe students, teachers staff. Science drive decision-making safely reopening schools. Public health agencies must make recommendations based evidence, politics. leave health experts tell us time best open school buildings, listen educators administrators shape it. praising NY bashing Florida gotten ridiculous that's coming liberal CT.



New York first state get hit bus hard. fight fire without water. game plan fight virus handle infected came states hit earliest.


Florida, Arizona Texas blew virus numerous reasons. luxury seeing Northern states take beating handed game plan combat it. excuse happening states.

Yes. am. Similar situation though bad.

Mouse Florida, governor believe virus: FULL OPEN DIEEEEE one locking down? 

There’s federal money citizens, government force lock people quitting job/locking exact effect people choose lockdown. Oh ok, semantics then. worth, may misunderstanding math.

Under theory 52,000,000 infected, 100,000 infected / day also miscalculated. 13:1 ratio would imply 1,300,000 per day we're finding 100,000. Well, range. weren’t super sure 5x 50x life indoctrination. mean, children still stand every morning, hold hand heart literally pledge allegiance US flag. gross actually take step back think what's happening. expect better past, know lot then. judge right now, unfortunately also well.

Honestly nations stupid. They're big represent people living yet also small enough portion world population nations like US use slavery abroad call progress. America's biggest root problem pride. Pride military, pride history, pride economy, they're same. Blind patriotic pride always excuse atrocities. least Britain forced come terms damage empire world, Americans still wearing Confederate battle flag.

There decent people everywhere, always been, always be. evil comes power comply easier. Think assume based comment. ""good luck"" reference countries saying American travelers welcome. Here’s thing. vaccine micro chip part supposed “new world order,” entire countries gotten virus completely won’t need vaccine.
There way anything vaccine cure probably half world population need never take it.

It’s almost like opening theme parks massive pandemic terrible idea.   long antibodies typically last vaccines routinely provided people? Yeah, dude talking about? Stick going work. Simple Yeah Freedom agree. Thanks compassion.  ""They best could.""

Somehow think southern state double deaths/mm single worst country world, afford benefit doubt, regardless first experience it. nonexistent, allowed exist? circular logic lost me. free believe let believe! Oh yeah? Put politicians jail? easy?

Gee, never thought it! Yeah guys, let's throw jail. literally easy, after-all.

We know jail. stop jail. rich rule poor, different whatever country in, perhaps obvious. think hoax tho 10x factor epidemiologists gave us March. apparently knew talking about. Exactly, ""twice"" much sounds way low US healthcare system. *You realize much idiot travel abroad*

Not exact words, Mark Twain said something along lines. Still holds true today. People misunderstands this. encountered cases people infected twice people tested positive active Covid-19 developed antibodies. saying likely immune six months least case. probably modest estimate update recommendations know it. like really think immunity lasts six months.

You still follow recommendations might spread disease bad hygiene even active infection. love turned little ""ha ha"" like nervous tick. Manner death recorded section different cause.  
Manner includes- natural causes, accident, homicide.  
Things like myocardial infarction, cancer, pneumonia, multisystem organ failure, COVID-19, Ebola, ect, considered natural causes caused say, hit bus.  
So natural causes, including Covid-19 would correct. There's probably additional causes coded actual cert well, Covid-19 kill variety factors.
Let see find guide filling Covid-19 death certs I'll edit comment come across it. true regarding Baby Boomers

What's infuriating boomers even anything earn level comfort. parents' generation sacrifice dying, United States arose alone amid worldwide destruction depression World War 2 boomers born nation plenty around them. wellllllll, fuck them! Yes, sucks. No, can't stop it.

Yes, can. countries states have. Deaths likely never 0/day vaccine there's big massive fucking difference current spread, death rate, hospitalizations, etc.

Why proper madantes face coverings, wait times two weeks lines several hours test, complete lack kind contact tracing, etc.? 

The fact people programmed believe going happen accept fucking insane. Lay Faux News. Yes, ROLF indeed. You’re laughable. fact can’t see issue you’re problem  apocalypse going on, disney would ~~still open.~~ make new attraction it. absolutely right thing do.

I wonder impact athletic scholarships teams scout athletes senior year. Small schools usually scout athletes senior year. guess they'll use footage old games, any? Paris hope that's turn gift Olympic game post especially infuriating reddit headline certain COVID-19 vaccine rolled year: Oxford developer

and actual headline article COVID-19 vaccine developer cautious 2020 roll-out Right. 

But thing happen lockdown. Trump clear unemployment money lockdowns. 

I understand quit job stay home, lose everything. state locks down, also lose everything effect finances. Sadly never watched lol gotcha. That's tad disturbing, friend GF went Florida visit dad thought older whatnot it'd kinda dumb, especially positive cases going right now. Thinking avoiding said friend month sure haha Japan test much countries. They're selective get test. many asymptomatic cases free travel spread virus, simply Japanese government refuses test them. raised respect PEOPLE, general. Old, young, doesn’t matter, don’t fucking spit people. Take look Kootenai County numbers elected. lot voters say. even polled schools. literally think constituents want. social media influencers  It’s time nudists rise up. First off, thanks response. clearly know topic appreciate taking time try explain me.

I think understand explained, seems like sophisticated version already.

I wondering little though, model take account probability someone come contact virus themselves, I'm understanding correctly. seems like calculations assuming every person meet virus pass P(n) pathogens you. model change account another probability whether person meet infected? understood part P(n), average taking account majority people would pass 0 pathogens on, making number likely small?

Furthermore, think assumption made I'm unsure truth of, additional virus particle independent static chance becoming source infection. would suspect might independent immune systems response, since immune system destroying one pathogen probably means cells destroying pathogens time. would assume would cause individual pathogens increase odds pathogen successfully cause infection. (I could totally wrong though, I'm expert) 

I also curious conclusions draw models. would seem say almost guaranteed get virus come contact carrier receive large viral load, similarly come contact large number carriers receive smaller load each. conclusion would minimize viral load receive wearing mask distancing, minimize number carriers come contact with. (which already knew, model confirming already knew probably good indication veracity)

Fyi: reddit interprets putting asterisks around something instruction put something italics show asterisks. example ""\*test\*"" becomes ""*test*"". want use asterisks equations multiplication operator without putting stuff italics disappearing, need *escape* putting single backslash (\\) front asterisks (also works character [reddit thinks means something) . example, ""400\*10\^3 50\*10\^3"" became ""400*10^3 50*10^3"" (notice italicized *and*) . typed typed quote, ""400\\\*10\^3 50\\\*10\^3"". gets bit complicated want actually display backslashes like did, involves backslashing backslashes. (8 total backslashes last quote) Ok! Still that’s really good info y’all there. Great job! Someone subsidize rest world's research cheap medicine, American taxpayer? can't shift far forward. IOC already said Tokyo cancelled outright happen 2021. People whine depression usually selfish turds. used one. truth really care families communities. lose someone, excuse continue dumb, selfish behavior. 

""Oh no, spread Rona Gammy, drowned fluids... guess need go back Disneyland cheer up."" people quitting jobs staying home. 

Again, federal money people stay home. States money support citizens. 

That means state locks entire workforce unable income unless able work home. 

So you’re afraid catching virus, aren’t quitting job staying home? people, effect exactly same. difference. Yes people love “go back work”. Hmm take 100% chance providing kids safe home food, take minimal chance kids. Hard decision. 

This shows ignorance. It’s like parents magical ability make problems go away. Canada’s already basically back it.

I went 50 person wedding lot precautions everyone pitches fine. Yeah becoming challenge. Worldometer stuck 22,000 hours. Right wear mask. feeling something like happen again. Hopefully looong time. It’s exactly it, situation. hope there’s second pandemic learn mistakes suspect already stopped business travel. I'm insurance industry, CT insurance mecca U.S. company work competitors already business travel policy entire United States. Good. “Might”

lol I’m excited! Every day we’re getting closer closer. can’t wait forget 2020. right restricted here? really similar flu many regards all. surprised? No, horrified extent. wonder US population banned many countries. title misleading best; number new cases last week (987) double new cases week prior (534). double total cases (52073) week. virus that’s long term issues unknown. freaks out, it’s much dying if’s future. virus like herpes, chickenpox lays dormant decades pop you’re 30 causes multiple organ failure skin start fall ends killing later life, entire generation teens grow like this. time, people charge long gone accountability knows taken care of. *Then European countries increasing well?*

What’s excuses them?

My point - entirely ignored - moving pack. rate increase greater countries us. Aw dude! I'm happy help!! yeah man, told mate today everyone losing shit right totally get fair enough, place angst compassion push help rather drown apathy right? :) 

And yeah dude that's really good enclosed space. Tbh probably safest place right now!!! keep safe too. Rona ain't nothing fuck with.

Just remember breathe; everything ok eventually. ever need breather, beer big Mac fab combo. watch fave TV show, play ur fave game, watch Bob Ross paint happy trees! human suck least random fun stuff distractions &lt;3

And good man honestly, much love rando across world :) hope everything gets better soon!!!! people Florida stopped many hotels, restaurants, stores, sites drive? really choice requires loosing job disqualified unemployment. people can't decide they're gonna pay rent.

And 40% America work, time tell boss shove it. There's lot competition tough job market. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Couldn’t substitute “Disney theme park” name open business? I'm convinced country ever great, honestly. great for? Middle class white people, allowed purchase single family home nice suburbs (that kept minorities) janitor's salary. People were, gender roles full force, anything white hetero Christian male, could better believe gonna obstacles life. Corporate tax pretty high though, good thing.

So ask - country great? great? Fucking never was. Velocity Yeah gave HEROES act long time ago. 

I think shows shit prepared. Everything shoddily slammed together ASAP, shows.

Unemployment state state varies much slapped $600 ontop called day. Unemployment shouldn’t terrible begin with. 

To honest, I’d favor sort UBI atleast rétroactive pay *did* work.  Varies vaccine targets virus varies strongly influence immune system. 

Ideally vaccine able provide minimum, multiple years protection time, virus fades prevalence. Stay home Hospitalizations peaked AZ, least now. There's real reason believe otherwise.

I really hope sub degenerate conspiracy theories. **Mickey**: ""You fat, diabetic bear, Chinese want you, don't, either! fuck Mr. Marsh?!""

He's responsible deliberately setting policies leading hundred FL people dying *every day* absolutely reason. policies condemned advance reckless, even refuses make changes, assume happy status quo actually sees political career important mass death constituents.

We would widely condemning Pol Pot someone piling death toll. There's bias.

The study presented hyped, unorthodox manner spin-prone politician seated nearby pitched lay audience. 

The study released without data review.

This study used justify immediate production drug produced company lobbyist White House.

That study contradicted another study released day.

Those simply facts. Wake up. impression 5x-10x considered reasonable assumption, end day rule thumb specific figure.

Did hospitalization rate increase decrease affected areas study? might give us answers. Americans cool quite true.my family careful go , can't stop braindead sister law giving shite virus. 

She even says take vaccine comes since it'll probably RFID trackers. SMH Strangely, hospitalization numbers peaked day news came hosp data reported new way HHS rather CDC, move caused couple states stop reporting hospital data altogether ""try"" get handle new process.

Also, said below, hospitalizations peak 8 days average number cases peaked way soon. Especially given many test results still back. actually know average cases peaked July 6.

I'm saying can't true, I'm saying there's lot leeway numbers reporting taking face value yet. gonna take sharpie numbers say negative cases? Tell it. year two college first one hit.

It's super hard fire career fed weird comparison death rate coronavirus children like 0.001% mean that's pretty much every employer though. herd immunity far guaranteed, there's whispers antibodies last long Covid 19

As short 2 weeks 2 months

If true, means outbreaks always problem unless course local lock-downs force people wear masks outside home idea whether death rate go up, down, stay same, *guessing* go down. Given death rate US going past two weeks, guess looks like bad one. Testing capacity increased well virus spreading. worried deaths spike Technically help b cells produce antibodies mechanism really relevant discussion here.

I people facebook still deny existence Covid use social media spread misinformation likes agreement comments. brown friends family post MAGA 2020 everyday. speak sentencing exile.

During protests cops literally led protest march. Walked people around block looked like 1:1 ratio cops protestors everybody went home happy feeling like accomplished something. akin master putting leash dogs taking walk. felt sick seeing it. city spends 41% budget police found this. want leave going virus checked.

I still post support masks, protests yes I've long since exiled friends family. care though. worth it. think second merced, fresno, kings, tulare counties Trump wants to. They'll happily suck Trumps balls asks to. Tests hard get Panama City.  aren’t getting tested unless significant symptoms, exposed someone, know someone get appointment. positivity rate testing high, number recorded cases per capita lower Florida general. Still...don’t go Florida!  saying Maxine got sheltered proof, think happening sitting governor? Lol cute Don’t worry. coworkers say it’s fake. offence taken. would like government declare masks mandatory. see reason keep 20-40 new cases day masks, hygiene distancing could real chance getting rid completely. Unfortunately see many ""hoax, common cold, fear mongering"" comments local facebook pages I'm doubting people would follow mandate know kind hospitalization numbers.  double since beginning June Shanghai disneyland open since May. Uninterrupted.

But Westerners would rather die instead wrapping head around fact societies like things better society. would anyone ounce common sense go amusement park? day somebody telling nobody ever understood medicine quickly greaterly before.

They probably failed. government requires wear clothes public. Go ahead exercise right ""not wear Government commands"" run around public naked. Let know goes.

Idk mandatory PTO thing implemented offered. told take 80 hours PTO preemptively. came back I'd -80 hour balance PTO would earn back. would taken 10 months. would taken knew going downsized

Schools opening Sept-Oct

Last heard eviction thing HUD housing, good see expanded it, sadly half states longer covered.

What mean government helping, failure cracking prevention. waited long close, opening early, places finally making people wear masks late. They're opening school cutting aid, forcing us go risk lives lives ones love.

Do realize quickly 2trill going go economy? Especially states pay rent evicted?

News flash *are* shitting us. cops longer reporting hate crimes order forge numbers, Trump trying stop us sending Covid numbers CDC, Ider rediculous reason had, know pretend massive wave actually happening. government's incompetence caused get bad. Idk read handy link within thread. least 50 amusement park employees sick COVID. supplies properly clean, they're allowed talk it. start, schools open up, that's really shits going hit fan. There's possible way properly social distance them. younger ones biohazard, swipe nose sleeves, chew pencils, cough sneeze regard. can't even keep love control we've dealing year yet still blows schools every year. contain something simple lice, can't contain COVID ((Did mention schools typing death letters teachers going send???))

The government done bare minimum they're going sacrifice us money god.  think pushback really social life, efficacy workplace. businesses allow/continue WFH, come judgement (from management level) regarding cost maintaining physical office space vs. benefit(s) staff said office space. Similarly, right now, many businesses extending WFH end year social distancing requirements WFH preferences liability costs (if company insurance plans, premiums would go employees hospitalized COVID). this, like things, comes cost employees able leverage performance favor. Good talent work well home may able wfh proven effective (not mention cheaper execute) sectors. Meanwhile companies calculate people home reduces efficiency/quality work. businesses may require collaborative work environments. little employee preference; Sucks that's system we're in. 38,800 people died automobile accidents 2019 United States. Four months ago today 447 deaths here, yesterday hit 134,400 per Johns Hopkins' site.  
  
That means we're far losing many people month Covid lose car accidents every year. Trump reelected almost instantly. Wow. That's sad environment. Glad things worked tho. .........ok, anyways. 


Anti-body's start fade virus longer present body stops producing threat gone. 


Your answer also, something? bean counters insignificant. people whose healthcare outcomes determined numbers, every little bit life death someone. Whether statistical analysis saved lives made front page bolstered someone's campaign much less relevant them. 

But 5 3 relatively smaller numbers 10. agree that. think tens billions dollars means lot food lot mouths though, whatever becomes necessary.

All really ignores important question though. necessary right now? I'm sure New York going pack midwestern tourists Times Square like cattle year. Good riddance tradition, ever since stopped allowing people move around mingle crowd 9/11, everybody looked miserable. I'm certain am.

Think sec...there one thing could would help here, start sharing true useful updates offering bit leadership crisis. think chances actually that?

Rest assured, briefings go poorly Trump. deaths saw went almost 1000 last week 500 yesterday. this? I’m suspicious White House different ways quantifying covid death CDC does. Makes sense would keep rising instead slipping back down. Maybe Trump say covid deaths issues count them? thought Florida still reporting COVID-19 hospitalizations (despite governor's promise start). 

Has changed?   Correlation narcissism preventative behavior scale weak though (r = -0.09). link Dark Triad whole stronger, much (around r = -0.15). barely worth reporting ...

PS: Dark Triad scale four items. two additional scales aspects narcissism, didn‘t correlate preventative behavior scale. Doesn‘t seem like solid study  Sweden would data point supports theory. article linked appear make attempt explain death rate approaching zero discussing. military bad alone Climate fine 

We’re doomed Even pandemic would considered assault. plenty pre-pandemic cases people charged assault spitting another. 

You may already know this, letting anyone reading thread know. Already r/NoShitSherlock Alleygator really. serious problems government various institutions. fully acknowledge need individual rights freedoms recognize threats them. Mask requirements pandemic one threats. jesus mean ban testing, mean reporting #'s cases since really matter seems like reported large #. #'s really matter hospitalization deaths. give ID part getting test Colorado isn’t matter opinion. It’s objectively fact US healthcare system absolute garbage. don’t like prospect helping anyone yourself, think getting fucked ass acceptable. send 2 year old back daycare? that's true, totally agree America dirty hands, think it, *any* nation major skeletons closet? hope true.

But hard believe. Holy shit sounds bit better lol You’re thinking wrong way actually playing hands. want frame words like “arbiters truth” “free speech”. it’s false notion. 

Social media companies **right protect brand**. ban whoever want. remedy stop using them. 

If crazy person starts shouting racist offense things shop **scaring away customers**, owner right kick out. 

A lot people think free speech applies private companies. **Free speech means GOVT can’t lock saying things. nothing private company giving platform.**

I hope Facebook, Twitter, reddit continue ban hate speech, foreign propaganda, Covid disinformation, kinds deeply offensive harmful things degrade society. AZ started Phase 3 UK back April. 

They claimed would know June. June approached changed tune suddenly started wanted Phase 3 Brazil SA.


They Phase 3 data. They've refused even hint it. 

They also seriously dragging feet starting Phase 3 US. 

It's still coin flip behavior increasingly become suspicious. Again, mask works well care?

Or ready admit mask doesnt anything that's exactly sounding like. 

The toddlers people like stamping feet didnt get way stupid mask idea believe. Great career opportunity afraid confrontation. Yes. way purposefully infect people would isolate hotel weeks exposing small amounts testing shows took. 

That's ""But might end infectious"" big issue first comment. infectious, even mild case, need stay away others. One year work could help add years loved ones lives. That’s way try look things right now. Best wishes. Fuck it. Charge attempted murder. Lock assholes away safety rest us. Saves comment later. Thanks! specify Tuesday. misinformation say tested 60-70k day days last week. accurate today's number tests lower average past week bit

edit: used common side effects pretty much every existing vaccine? Sorry countries meet meet criteria vaccine comes out. best place wait would high acreage low population density area western country nowhere near large urban area You’re assuming he’s assuming positive cases 100k day. total number 100k day, regardless positive test, match checks out. 

We’ll never 100k positive tests day. current positive test rate we’d need like million tests day. It’s never gonna happen. 100k infections every day could legit number regardless positive test. math checks out. It’s interesting countries populist leaders cope badly. UK, US Brazil often mentioned one breath had/have significant, almost uncontrollable outbreaks.

Some populist leaders performed rather well, though – least Hungary, Poland others didn’t fail catastrophically, far know. Denying facts science seems greatest problem. That’s surprising it’s still remarkable. meddle title OP. clearly says ""could"". Lol first thought hating Joe Rogan joke understand. Check wikipedia article Regulatory Capture. true, USA death rate would 0.29%. significantly lower thought. Well hope know doing. day day change, day changes week week, shown minimal variability compared way.

I still use averages things, data still useful nonetheless. get started. believe tho said ICU hospital care. mom told apparently Kansas number one terms rate case increase per capita. good. surprising since still one lowest state testing per capita soccer back, foreign (teams diff countries) games start august. dont get tokyo olympics wont happen 2021, considering amount money involved. soccer teams test players 3x week, olympics. US bad this, dont understand metric system?  Well OP doctored headline one.  Starting December, everything goes perfectly then.

My family jumped ship Europe clearly saw burning glacier approaching States. 

Sitting one cabin alps. 20% positive every day  love everyone throwing numbers around without sources. once, thirty minutes lunch break. I’m scientist. blows mind people think it’s hard? Two masks face shield, half mask resp depending I’m working with. know nurses university 2 shields + face mask. There's evidence ""Oxford vaccine"" actually work, pass review. lots reasons believe never released. 

This true vaccine candidates well. asked elaborate. enough, I'd rather respond then...

Lol what? 

I won’t beliefs questioned foolish demands “elaboration” “explanation”! Look one day next good method since pretty large variability. looking averages tell need know. Also, Ireland shares land border UK. 

Ireland’s stats include Northern Ireland. God can’t even imagine choose catching Covid school catching shelter job. Wtf! nearly 1 4 testsd positive... 

I dont think understands works.  support narrative. Lmao statement/fact. one even argue still need wear mask got vaccine? see history you’re TN. report abuse (which is) Anyone ever seen read side effects every major drug market? One think heart attacks causes itchy perineum. Yes, make taint itch. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But still take choice worse. might holding chart upside Ronnieboy.  many people care unless happens THEM. exaggerate. Enough people wearing mask create extreme problems. Obviously people wear masks.  many stimulus cheques sent individual average? can’t wait forget 2020.

Don't. really forget happend year. Keep mind, lear move forward. make mistakes again. Yes, everyone wouldn’t issue, everyone doesn’t. Again, you’re entirely missing point. mask isn’t protect everyone else, it’s protect everyone else you. vent mask, doesn’t that. someone supposed smart, you’re difficult time grasping concept. 

Im glad feel confident keeping family safe, nothing perfect, I’ll say again. chance someone home gets infected, likely get infected, you’ll spread others outside household using masks vent. you’re either stupid, stubborn selfish recognize mistake here. I’ll let choose perfect time go! /s

All kidding aside, feel entirely outdoors park minimal attendance could relatively low risk managed correctly. Still myself, think low attendance digital queues rather waiting line, consistent sanitation masks required could safer many things. America countries it. America good idea. fact is, Sweden's data way worse Finland's:

[Official Data \- Cases Age Group: 
0-9 years: 481 cases 
10-19 years: 3,179 cases

[Official Data \- Cases Age Group: 
0-9 years: 237 cases 
10-19 years: 419 cases

Even limited testing, Sweden officially reporting 5 times many cases people aged 19 under.

Their report pure bullshit. infuriating boomers even anything earn level comfort.

There's Simpsoms episode Boomers run everything ground Grandpa (and fellow Greatest/Silent generation peers) clean mess ""like [they] always do."" course, Homer peers unappreciative. quickly expectations change Right now, Moderna Oxford expected available end year. smiling realized may well kids pass them. deserve that. can't even get folks wear masks? correct. Looking daily data exercise futility. Also, still states back fill data instead producing daily numbers rarely people go back look previous days data. agree Ireland bad example. look Germany fair comparison European country handled pandemic well. 

They 1/4th death rate/1M pop 1/5th cases/1M pop nationwide population density 6.6 times U.S, get ""highly dispersed"" population advantages U.S. particular comparison (a smaller, similar comparison opposite direction Ireland-U.S. comparison Ireland gets island advantage).

Here's chart G7 countries 2 aforementioned variables well heat map total cases (as something like see analysis- especially useful comparisons different slices use see countries similar total case counts fared 2 imagine U.S. pass UK's death/M pop (at least hope not), sheer numbers game perspective we'll likely pass France within next 2 weeks Italy within next 2 months continue see exponential case growth certain sectors U.S. especially European countries (seemingly) greatly reduced rate spread.

In general also feel G7 analysis better ""expected outcomes"" countries grouped similar expectations socioeconomic conditions.

The additional takeaway U.S. distinct problem among highly-economically-developed nations slowing spread virus absolutely something accepted addressed (not necessarily you, U.S. leadership Federal State level). care wellbeing, well family’s. That’s wear mask.

I don’t wear mask Government tells to. wear mask care fellow man. However, Government force citizens wear mask. Well we're going get discounting outliers without rational can't prove anything.

I disagree autocratic system effective fighting things like covid19, wrong say they're thing fight it. Situations like New Zealand proof this.

Response something like covid19 purely determined form government. want simplistic non-scientific go right ahead.  Science process defending hypothesis arbitrarily discounting outliers. Ignorance bliss. imagine everyone see without mask Trump voter see fucked are.

That exactly see it. vaccine quickly. going campiegn ""briefings"". Also ignores mutations would make herd immunity considerably difficult multiple strains. read story several years ago. Passionate individual funky name. wear mask.

Right infect others. forgot individualism costs. Rugged individualism lie sell real shit: selfishness. Make selfishness cultural value you’ve taken brakes capitalism. sounds incredibly implausible.

I'm assuming title clickbait bullshit, actually 24.4 percent people went test (so symptomatics). Correct I'm wrong, actually real random sample town. LoL......Thats affair hard hide:p Good point. Thanks. US could stupid enough open fucking Disneyworld wheb there's pandemic 150k dead.

Cash king, guess. Tell UK.. afford great healthcare, get everywhere. Sorry US trying STOCKPILE rest world's COVID vaccine, buy buy companies make it.

Then sold back profit public countries. “I literally think everything life death, black white” - everybody sub

The perceived risk society whole objectively way lower months ago, that’s answer friend’s actions, like not. know, rich long accept it. Oh please Especially since funneling results White House...  Upvoted even noticing lol nice argument. id like math me. 6377/9900000. insane scared number. ""positivity rate' phrase used, phrase used headline article.

I'm sure previous commenter asking, like lot (any?) areas US entire population tested, extrapolating positivity rate kind standard (with usual caveats symptomatic/asymptomatic 'not enough testing'). major hotspot cities seem test 20-25% level. start slowing point conjugation certain level distancing? coincidence? idea revolution would solve problems somehow change narcistic ignorant etc... society overnight childish.

You left profoundly religious. Nothing changes *except* revolution. Except evidence support that. pessimistic understand currently company thinks vaccines available then.  *Artists begging stop, let 'em!*

*Labor conditions shop? sweat 'em!*

""It extremely alarming even young people mild courses suffer long-term symptoms. keep hearing young people say: worried, even become infected Corona, probably mild symptoms made antibodies that's I'm safe side. ""

Not isolated case still early diagnose chronic diseases, Covid 19 young that. data collected American patient organization worldwide infected people indicate former corona patients sometimes suffer symptoms long time, says researcher Hannah Wei Toronto.

""We're getting news people symptoms ten weeks twelve weeks still healthy.""

Hannah Wei, Covid 19 Patient Research Team

For Miklas Spohr, worldwide investigations confirmation believed long time isolated case came across fellow sufferers Facebook.

""Then good see people exactly same. also husky voice, like clear throat time, also headache, also days it’s better also days it’s really crappy. ""

Just would rip apart yup, plus unlucky, small dose would still make sick kill you... possible predict exactly persons immune system respond even supposedly perfectly healthy. Coughs Floridian. someone likes ignore relevant information? need explain interesting people thread complaining stating facts long experts think hear demoralize people inaction, calling attention faults vaccinating highest risk individuals causing death rate go down. would undoubtedly cause huge lift restrictions people could negate work vaccinations. literally nothing back claim. He's hoping number cases go down. government enforcing property rights collapses, good property rights? Kind pointless study...I mean, country like SK shit together taking precautions public environment keep mask check. would mean likely way spread virus would home symptomatic or--even likely--asymptomatic person contact far far less cautious ways. could things everyone wore mask. Oh that’s great. Thanks. hear propaganda machine warming up. Oh that’s great know. Thanks! #1

Tldr comments.

Anyone young, healthy without previous illness easily cope corona infection. get sick, quickly healthy antibodies protect new infections. Many think so. affected people complain severe after-effects weeks infection passed negative test. Doctors puzzled.

He shadow himself, even though corona infection almost 4 months ago. Miklas Spohr sports teacher extreme athlete. Surfing, diving, mountain biking, free riding, hobbies. jogging route Benediktenwand Garmisch district, usually runs 10 kilometers mountain forest two three times week. barely walk kilometer take break every then.

""With relapse, suddenly circulatory problems, dizziness attacks. Real weakness attacks, suddenly nothing worked anymore. since I've struggled again. change two good days, one, two, three bad days again. three good days again. completely - can't count what's going on. ""

He caught infection ski camp early March, spent four weeks bed home. never hospital. tested negative April 3, since considered recovered. virus detectable body anymore. beginning looked students home, can't either.

Miklas Spohr suffers long-term complaints corona infection: ""So bad conscience every day, especially good days can't work, bad days, clears quickly. everyone feeling yes bad is, feeling taken seriously. ""

The whole Spohr family active sports. photo albums currently reminding this. Simone Spohr also fell ill Corona March, recovered better, work again, far fit before.

""Really not. anyway get B get never really sick. maybe comes flu every three years anything, oh actually never. live, eat healthy. fresh air lot. also don’t understand caught, others so. really is, hard. ""

Long-term symptoms even milder courses Medicine also looking answer question. Schönklinik Königsee renowned department lung diseases. beginning, Covid 19 patients treated mainly severe courses - mild courses coming fore.

""We actually see patients recovering quite well difficult courses, vice versa also see number patients moderate courses residuals bring colorful bouquet things remained.""

Data patient survey conducted Kings College London shows one ten patients complains symptoms general fatigue, headache, dizziness, loss smell, persistent breathing difficulties, diarrhea rash even four weeks infection.

Cardiac arrhythmias diabetes also appear long-term effects Covid19 disease, despite antibodies.

""So far, well understood, honestly say is. certainly learned past months virus clings many places. seems reason many Places problems remain body. ""

Prof. Andreas Koczulla, Schön Klinik Berchtesgadner Land

Antibodies protect Israel, too, doctors Shaare Zedek Medical Center Jerusalem registering increasing complaints patients discharged healed. Although virus longer detectable test, complained long-term symptoms first study. patients significantly worse acute phase illness. Quick question:

Are examples hairdressers working COVID symptoms wear masks? infection rate them?

I'm denying people wear masks, hardly scientific study without expected infection rate would without masks. actually FB friend said virus ""big fucking deal"" [until doubles global think infected camp government offices including governors. They'll get I'm sure, despite older possibly suffering number diseases would complicate infection. good see mix comments Sweden bashing. Everyone's going keep acting like ""Karens"" difficult, there's clear pattern physical aggression. happened England too, person spat died. wonder trustworthy data given Trump took control believe question already begun production vaccine risk? hopes starting churn millions doses September Friendly reminder vaccination causes herd immunity. clobbered virus strict lockdowns 95% economy. basically 24/7 military curfew. US cities could handle kind paralysis 2 3 weeks, 2 3 months. Italy's public health system deal hundred cases contact tracing isolating suspected individuals prevent spread. thousands tens thousands like US states, accelerates fast mitigation measures. they're boat rest us.... think proven coukd twice? disnt italian doctor catched twice? I've using Johns Hopkins map keep track virus, wondering resources way normalize data account testing? words, want get sense many newly reported cases transmission, many increased testing. spidy senses tell this? would totes cross border better life! wouldn’t..? Genuinely curious. “That teach kids life teacher worthless eyes society.”
With point view, society also views healthcare workers retail workers worthless.

Some jobs essential require risks. Teachers acting selfishly crying potential getting sick.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sure. it’s big fucking range. 

Sure could 2x would mean around 8 million infected. could 13 times 50 million infected. Bit big gap estimate yeah? fact it’s usefulness estimate shit. Upper lower bounds is.

We aren’t 13x cases per day. aren’t 1.3 million cases day. Given 150 days since started dealing would 150 million. clearly aren’t high spread. 200k cases day would 30 million. Sounds reasonable. 30 million would still estimate 8x spread confirmed. Sounds safe 2-13x range arguable accurate estimate high end. Siths deal absolutes.

&amp;#x200B;

No, seriously, way give exact estimate actual # infections. term ""likely"" intellectually honest. used work Intelligence military learned use terms like ""likely"", ""unlikely, probable, possible etc. use terms deal absolutes unless 100% undeniable evidence (which hardly ever happens). old news. story happened June 17. v them.

Greta spend money whoever chooses. However, many causes 90k would benefited people.

That Amazon tribe anything benefit humanity. experts literally said February America become super spreader re-spread virus rampantly throughout unaffected parts world. even said bring virus back countries control, far absolutely correct. That'd make vaccination quite common occurrence, that's so. earliest regular people get probably early 2021, people vaccinated middle year see making exceptions pregnant teachers? pregnant workers industries? 

Have ever seen lift finger help pregnancy way-- funding healthcare fetuses, funding additional food services fetuses? Strengthening anti-pregnancy discrimination laws?

I think actually give shit unborn either. I'm hotel worker. Even mask mandates guests still wearing forgetting them. Guests coming leisure. I'm seeing license plates many different states. also expect clean occupied rooms. 


I actively looking different line work. ^(help me) stepmother plans retiring early try force back work school fall since lupus. bad since she’ll get lower pension planned for... bad since lost jobs lose health insurance earlier expected. question would start vaccinating already produced millions doses. Maxine waters estimated met worth 0.5-3 million

The issue keeps coming back. know difference millions, billions, trillions? Accurate sickly digest According orange hair grumpy old man, russians good. chineses bad. Thank weighing-in. seems like people hugely unrealistic expectations vaccines approved process looks like. counties cities take harsher measures. NYC worse exponential spread shut became obvious. 

If counties like wait another month shut may way worse NYC, especially risk people less healthcare capacity. hospital capacity runs out, deaths explode.

There may also less help available neighbouring counties states suffering outbreaks.

The mentality worst possible past exactly make outbreaks worse. people still ""it can't happen here"" mode, half year since happened China? problem vaccines usually spend YEARS pre-clincial work, years Phase 1 2 time get Phase 3 data there.

In case pre-clincial work less 3 months.    Hey, Kemp.... Hold beer.... know fact deaths underreported. Family friend got Corona, hospitalized, caught infection killed him. Great aunt caught corona, okay sick, caused trip fall ultimately passed. Brother's GMIL stopped getting daily care due COVID risks, passed complications diabetes. None count Corona deaths certainly caused it. mention tens thousands going die poverty, homelessness, starvation caused Covid. John Trump went MIT smart man, great doctor. lot people also surprised well Trump understands medicine

he passed cognitive test together. definitely knows elephant Positivity rate means total number tests performed day coming back positive, total population positive COVID.  Yes, say everyone. see fellow Americans fighting, love it, course, ignorant loudest, thus visible. even read. much Mickey going donate campaign? cremations quick! Black Plague COVID, exactly level severity Yes, pure genius embrace study published without supporting data, right-wing con artist seated nearby pitched, used start production drug produced company lobbyist administration different study ignored.

Hilarity ensues. even read said last sentence. context we're talking about. FFP3 used AGP/ICU UK FFP2 used wards/clinics. 

Source: UK nurse. Well considering NYC went absolute hell gotten \~20% population antibodies (and experiencing herd immunity) sounds like herd immunity way go... wouldn’t say religiously follow anything see here, ultimate goal trying persuade people’s fears virus reasonably lower level

Maybe US cases everyone else almost many deaths Brazil, UK, Mexico put together. anyone confirm time alcohol selling shops normally close Colorado ? CANNOT wait listen Donald Trump talk shit 60+ mins every day. tremendous entertainment UK feel sorry Americans leader.

P.S. I'm aware we're much better annoying side Atlantic. Love see clearly exposing people took time read article full looked headline started typing foaming mouth it.

(NOTE: foaming mouth, way, COVID LEAST concerns right now! :D ) Come bomb us, literally everyone else. Perfect opportunity.  problem people going use situations like state numbers “inflated.” good Let's call 'Thot' magazine instead thought magazine non American sucked watching US decline. I'm emotionally prepaired that. I'll save case want due inside even tho Congrats gf success shutdown (even though sure gf still employed Disney work year still benefits work someone else disney id #1 priority job emphasized hiring process. however forget mention benefits come play become full time conditional full time. waitlist become full time take dependent job. health insurance free lowest tier pay high deductible main gate pass allows entry 3 people give free tickets pass non transferable. 15/HR unions fought disney could would paying state min wage 12/hr food employees wierd pay rate covered rest tips thing living wage measure passed Anaheim hospitality district living wage disney still odds for.

Embrace misery, sit butt watch tv! May well 1,000 today. Seems week deaths rising Wish could one day. Minus CNN. Maybe motortrend it’s important note there’s ethical issue here. ethical way go it, even skews results bit. 

That said, it’s still interesting study. Fascists denied platforms whenever possible. That's one worst parts awful situation. like, *no one* needs hear him. all. need educated people giving us information updates. Nothing says means anything causing even damage giant amount already done. would think nurses midwives who've practicing years would felt tired know feels different, you?  Monday’s counts always pretty low, I’m sure go back today. may right White House messing data Per capita, likely.

But FL like ""hold beer"" Friday onwards, introducing compulsory masks shops, public buildings transport, many others, 100 cases reported daily throughout country - already reduced 30 weeks ago.

The numbers USA simply incredible. total chaos. Huh? fines punishment... wrongdoing.....

Also Maxine waters found innocent Republicans... even republican congressman buy conspiracies lol mind business  way plan things happened yet! Dude, means liquor sales 10pm day. sold following day. IIRC, liquor stores sell past midnight. Watch Mississippi. bit smaller population wise deaths spiking recently. one really talks them. charities vague do.

That's blaming charity. I'm sorry WHAT?

I've never seen heard flag life I'm concerned one. We're concurring places anymore right? know that's true terrible idea censor president united states. could backfire incessant MSM fake news martyrdom. IMO, AstraZeneca seems like best bet. results tests well diplomatic approach price gouge, work US distribution network one 18/25 people got Another prison around Here's 72% semi-narcissist Easy there, can't make guy nuclear codes feel stupid. sure Trump suddenly taking pandemic seriously relief bad omen what’s come.

Is taking seriously political reasons, told private U.S. going collapse people don’t follow public health guidelines? creates crowded stores 9:45.

Wait, that's bad thing.  

So answer question, know. Prisons high infection rates, example, would seem support theory large percent population pre-existing protection. think theory necessarily implies virus detected individuals. sure addressed not. chance skim far. somebody please think guns!  ""God"" save beginning flat trend? That's reasonable margin error. Still problem extent disqualifies results. Even 10,000 false positives, many people still dying. agree bad life, COL far manageable. seems think he'll making fortune there. questions notes Congress hearing vaccines today:

Luckily it’s nearly 100% harmless little kids. fear children education going held ransom indefinitely issues little danger class school pandemic. 

For example, actual data access to, virtually danger allowing elementary school classrooms operate close normal. Instead acknowledging that, pretending data doesn’t exist. end?

If ignore data, completely shut elementary education, allow kids learn? never convince k-3 gets valid instruction virtually. Things going much different January 2021 now. schools hold goofy standard staying shut down, kids kindergarten March 2020 away peers classroom instruction year half. 2nd graders 1 semester learning social skills actual class academics. 

Then, happens next time severe flu year? shut another semester? precedent setting it’s issue lot people want admit. 

We real damage entire generation elementary students, name science, agendas, politicization, emotion. far fewer deaths! must something right? underage, wonder gets kind cash, I'm glad donating help cannot help themselves. Mass graves tell tales. Oh sure, money used buy firearm drive kids house everyday taken from,say, mortgage fund back payments wife kids leave debt whoever gave money pay mortgage, really worth scare one kid away?

Wow analogy got convoluted real quick.
Tl:dr- What's point large military defend country country longer exists time troops return deployment? 62 year old cancer survivor mother law designated one mask reminder people (not enforcer, needs report non compliance management). 

So yeah, fun. :( Stupid ass mf  wants go space stack money tower climb *cries Walmart blue*  seems like US's enemies trying hack good ol' USA vaccine yet. Anyone else super worried that?  also premise Margaret Atwood's *Oryx Crake* (MaddAddam trilogy).

Also NY likely way way cases reported. Testing wasn’t nearly available now. bet death rates aren’t far apart might think plus factors mentioned lowering death rates Soon death certificates pass White House. governor say schools county watch list remain online (including OC) ? know moronic OC school board voted open class teaching, suggestion official edict. already seem it.. itd bad got places like that. kind fucking idiot spits 69-year old; pandemic not? people seriously screws loose. Oh wow, that’s pretty big step. I’m supportive closing bars, don’t know need ban people buying certain types products.

Edit: comments make see it’s 10pm nightly. article’s wording unclear. anyone wondering context Cruz's question. trying figure drink cup masks on. Somehow surprise me. Right!? weird many people quote kid fatality stats sort protection. 

Like, takes real ballsy idiot gamble life, trashy ballsy idiot gamble others lives line, special kind ultimate-selfish trashy ballsy idiot willingly gamble children's lives.

I would hope overall, people minus antimaskers, trying best shield kids exposure. Responsible parents dealing really pissy kids mostly stuck inside. taken kids store yet year, son super angsty without access playground. Oh well, survive long get unlucky tripping tracks idiot left behind. It’s ok, really briefings. Pretty sure they’ll turn political attacks days 🤷🏻‍♂️  bizarre. respiratory viruses start throat, that's accumulate able first infect cells. virus incubates 3-5 days feel effects, people caught exercising without knowing sick. They're respirating virus deep lungs days end. Well rural CA said “most people” haha title little misleading. Alcohol sales close 10 PM EVERY NIGHT restart next day.

Colorado going dry. Comparing NYC Florida would apples oranges. worked days coworker end testing positive. since work hospital (we dont work units) required wear masks times everyone person worked tested negative. MASKS MAKE DIFFERENCE  russian ones, thats cool. NY 1676 deaths per 1 million population CA 197 deaths per 1 million population. might want get high horse dude. 8th column table linked Oh ok. misunderstood then. bad. would true, still far away herd immunity... Well, agree problem contact tracing. like easier done doctor.

Most likely get disease someone know likely spread someone live, work socialize with. former resident got fuck outta there, help landed central valley I'm stuck send help.

But real knew OC conservative think stupid  smokestack looks ominous.... win another gold medal. Yeh us. USA USA region country live in? Bruh.... 1% population. doesn’t seem right. Wonder many asymptotic presumed.  Yes mentioned Mississippi post. They’re getting hammered still calling hoax. yet persisted..... Nobody knew elephant looked like Donald Trump pointed out.  yet Texas Senator John Cornyn (up re-election November) nerve say “The good news is, look numbers, one age 20 died coronavirus. still don’t know whether children get transmit others” 

 Went faster rate 2 weeks ago due many states opening up. expected. next week, continued go up, much slower rate. See pattern yet? coming week flatten. See yet? Guess happen 2 weeks. 

We’ll see goes. Havana club? Let's send nice OG kush.  weird fixated million dollar conspiracy instead addressing billion dollar proven fraud

Again, think differentiate numbers. God thing educator! Population density minimal effect spread disease.

cf. Asia  You’re bringing absolutely nothing table silly alarmist nonsense. Nah 5 pm eastern almost everything already. Might even hit 1,000 voted home depot workers drank kool aid? Sweden say 7 days first symptoms, least 2 days without fever (measured) feeling well.

Google it. said it. 56%, 23% opposed, bothered read. 

But mean want continue funnel untold billions MIC that's prerogative. Maybe they'll even invent better tasting boot. Show math would realistically show thousands children dying. 

You can’t, it’s true. It’s hyperbolic bullshit pretend science data don’t exist , less people need simple things, like wear masks, going listen. 

Stop alarmist unless back real data. Another factor (until maybe recently parts Texas, etc) hospitals haven’t overwhelmed able give better standard care. could see things spike bit back south overwhelmed hospitalizations large scale like NY mean someone gonna data many bodies bury. estimate exponential growth. rush guys, time world. dunno man I'm rural CA starting pick around parts lately. worry cause handful stores everyone goes places.  didnt help any. boo Caring loved ones first people do. people however best uninterested well-being strangers actively wish harm lot them. Italy Spain comparing rest Europe. places hitted first hard enough time prepare properly. Plus things progress. get better treatments better protocols etc. That's mitigation method introduced. give us time prepare knowledge deal it.

It called noval virus reason. live CA? really locked hard. Sure restaurants schools closed, besides people living lives. besides numbers start getting bad reopened restaurants bars month. since caused numbers get bad, shows lockdowns help.   new US coronavirus report, GOOD. Lol. ""Data backs efficacy""? Yeah... really well except one fuck killed hundreds thousands people ruined economy. supposed pick choose eliminate negative data, efficacy superb. Adviser:  
 ""You need tell wear masks, important emphasise this."" 


Trump: 
 ""Everyone listen, old people previous health conditions dying, young people basically immune, America GREAT, we're reducing mortality rate much - way wear masks"" foreign countries bar Americans entering borders. USA, matter policy, control emigration. don’t want great anymore. Virus hits ceiling around 15-25%.

There way state like FL even catching 1 5 cases. June least 5% FL already infected. Higher certain places, lower others.

FL detecting 60-90k cases week. Even miracle catching 1 5 300-450k case per week. puts FL best 5 8% infected month. Yeah like fire. Absolutely  Um, two thoughts related? I've heard find anything peer reviewed. One month, large schools...still taking shit seriously, see. Texas Football: true religion Honestly probably healthy life choice. actually appalling people real life human beings share species. shows least Trump got elected US WINNING Covid 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Wow, said something makes sense?

That news I've telling people beginning starting finally realize right. Without vaccine, cannot go back normal. Canada trying lessen restrictions cases numbers going back It’s actually going happen? Hospitals go around CDC straight White House data? reality anymore. logic reason become hate crimes? Yea, healthcare companies care employees even covid. assure across country every nurse told ""this business first"" employer point. anyone healthcare, like business, care second organizations bottom line.  think medical spending preventative framework. spent fraction spent Covid lost due decreased GDP would better prepared next. That's IMO though.  ""coronavirus briefings"" aka ""tax payer funded reelection campaign videos"" Yeah expectation know. Still, vaccinating vulnerable frontline workers huge know poll numbers There's nothing stopping country shutting handful cases detected, that's required political will. look quick Vietnam shut things down. Yup. dumpster fire epic proportions. We're paying way much getting way little back. 

Solving healthcare issue would crowning achievement either political party generations.

The thing bigger domestic issue healthcare climate change, think. sounds nice, already funds blocked used. 

You know, feds think testing much. striking made illegal, isn’t part rights? Great job Cuomo! would know? obviously invited. hear? Trump starting back misses fucking ratings time slot. Basically means available priority basis. general public able get vaccine, people highest risk getting disease.

Health care workers, high risk individuals, essential employees probably going first get them, trickle there. appliance repairman said fairly easy visualize virus virus does. 70-80% seems like common number. 

That still means 20-30% could natural immunity? That’s massive. I'd love fly wall things really set make face.

Was poll numbers? reality setting bad situation is? cut boys’ hair time time, trim mine weeks ago. go longer normally would you’ll fine. 23 eminent public health experts Canada basically agree Sunetra Gupta. say [as July 2020](http://balancedresponse.ca/open-letter/): prevent contain every case COVID-19 simply longer sustainable stage pandemic. need accept COVID-19 us time find ways deal developed fear COVID-19. Going forward, supported understanding true level risk, learning deal disease, getting lives – back work, back school, back healthy lives vibrant, active communities across country. They're private company, airtime expensive, decide use leisure. censorship anything even approaching censorship. unbelievable many people live country even understand *the first amendment* constitution. I’m sorry. really am. goes American citizens well understand fucked we’re making things right now. hope things get better point Well 4,018,598 ""right now"". reddit? way! narcissist likely stockpile take care others pandemic?! gulf war resulted huge increase Leukaemia Iraqi civilians (who fault actions tyrant leader) well coalition troops.

(as well supporting Israel) 

All all. successful war.


Bosnia, I'm sure America really lay claim anything here. Bosnia wrote U.S February '94 asking help since war crimes committed them. U.S congress agreed war crimes fact committed, year later. peace negotiations took place Paris, treaty signed, negotiations took place Ohio. Whilst NATO provided support bombing, overwhelming majority fighting serbs, bosnians, slavs, croats.
Claiming victory US Bosnia equivalent saying get involved fight younger brothers, end, stepping in, throwing single punch, telling sit different corners, claiming victor. better stake claiming U.S WW2, almost rest allied nations would agree victory red army. anyone gets pissy something literally nothing with, try jumping barrier next NY marathon running last mile race actual runners arrive. See give medal call winner, see give guy ran whole race.

Kosovo, NATO soldiers. Americans fighting also soldiers dozen nations, alongside people Kosovo. Interestingly, NATO soldiers, casualties suffered U.S soldiers. Take whatever that, probably varies depending degree overt nationalism sense humour individual. UK would probably take piss, I'm sure Americans little bit sensitive around subject 'veterans'.

Honestly, hard call one win US. Feels like win Kosovo.

Korea, make laugh.

Lebanon, here's mess. Whilst US around Lebanon long time, involvement Lebanese civil war lasted two fifteen years. third four stages war. US's immediate entry, part multinational force, positive peace treaty signed. went shit real fast Israeli affiliated mercenaries massacred bunch people. lead formation Hezbollah bombing US embassy Beirut, 63 died. US French base bombed, 241 Americans 58 French died. US pulled region, bombings continued US targets. 25 died US fled Lebanon US invalidated passports travel Lebanon.

Nothing seems victory me.

I think fair say last war U.S honest hand winning WW2, interest fairness one name could fit trophy US's. Maybe would fairer say last war U.S U.S civil war? Yeah, nice thing sealed can/dry goods start approaching label dates give food drive resupply pretty cheap. like able give charity free countries give residency wealthy hurdles. invest certain amount money in. countries even require investment provides jobs. purchase real estate worth certain amount without mortgage in. quite countries, threshold $500,000 property. That's drop bucket wealthy. They've always reported daily new hospitalizations, reporting total currently hospitalized available beds daily basis, although vast majority hospitals providing data separately, state aggregating statewide number daily report.

The headlines subject misleading. parents die fall cracks, anyway. hell? He's literally censoring information. scary. What, may ask, neutral world?  Government small infect millions!  right keep telling people insisting we'll vaccine ready end year. Ready who? gets first? fast get delivered?

Does anyone idea hard going vaccinate even 20% country's population short time?

We're going get absolutely brutal second wave end year going run right early 2021. could 5-6 working vaccines time, distributing hundreds millions vaccinations going fast.  Yes Oh man, shit's serious little room coffee maker mysterious, unknown provenance safer bet lobby coffee shop. Trump going use Coronavirus update spread lies substitute rallies bars even open CO? assumed curfew liquor stores. ffffff...... think is? quote start Phase 3.

They already move Phase 1. Someone needs beat hell guy. That's true. past weeks number deaths increasing. think 7-day average around 800. Back late June, around 400 high. also around time lot Southern states started get hit, since hospitalizations soared. Apparently, guess booster shot needs taken months first one, gives time ramp production accordingly Yes, makes even worrisome, true. true. I’m slightly average size body language makes seem vulnerable. That’s learned long time ago go absolutely apeshit bullies. cowards often aren’t prepared victims fight back.  $70 billion year won’t really much. It’s $200 per American thought isolate two clean tests Nah think it'll run lot people. It'll minor inconvenience then.   manage kill ACA, uninsurable life covid. We've months since outbreaks Europe NYC. widespread, severe issues children contracted coronavirus, I'm certain we'd seeing now. severe children. doom gloom. Jubilee! It’s time. number people Walmart Iowa city still don’t wear masks toooooo high    Eh missing out. Nature beautiful even shitty people. generally avoid shitty people. pretty reasonable take. would assume vaccines distributed 2021 would emergency approval general population.

Most likely highest at-risk, first responders, medical professionals, etc. before, after, 'disappears soon?' great enough yet? people charge understand need add huge chunk essential workers mix completely avoided. functioned fine 3 months last year completely non-contact schooling 1:1 chromebooks students. understand families support child home need work away house shoving child place contact virus inevitable answer. assuming t-cells correct pedigree successfully hypermutation selective b-cells.

Without looking deeply immunology therefore guessing, could CD8 CD4 Th1 lineages end selected - rather combined CD4 Th2 T-cells/B-cells.

A CD8 responder could still wipe infection - could slower react, potentially period infectivity. might never have, generate need antibody response.

To assume T-cells help B-cells produce antibodies dismiss highly important role managing multiple infectious diseases - example TB. Adaptation antibodies. CA  20 days sounds better think winner. soon masks go immediate drop transmission. Positive cases hospitalizations quickly follow. used shop Dollar Tree. Never liked Family Dollar tho. problem shortage masks. hard find them. also expensive do. blame needs go federal government newsom failing act fast. thought Brits smarter  get voted. burning US South evidence back start month. 

I'll say said then: August entire US South decline. 


It's over. simplest solution wear mask presence others, tbh. ran exponential regression. correlation coefficient 0.999 pretty damn solid. 

If nothing changes, we'll hit 5 million 14 days, 11 days later hit 6 million, 7 million 10 days that. thousands examples reinfection real issue rather handful possible cases?  It’s going horrifying. Sometimes first actually. I've passed rural towns Texas dollar store nearest grocery store walmart 40 minutes away.  Yes. care people unless give things (mostly money political favors) dirt him. Nukes countries guns individual. Military might mean shit sides nukes.   There's gonna supply issues gonna cost insane amount free vaccination sites lineups 9 hours long run 2 hours. Feds close leaving 2 per metro area. .......... Pennsyltucky strikes again. Ignorant American here. overlords decided entertaining distracting yet.  know everything two everything done past 10 years lol? use home IP lol? Yes, 1st states hit hit hardest. know quite treat yet, surprise.

The states spiking remember 4 times less likely die learned trial, error, shit ton people dying.

And people get sick 3 months probably going even better chances bunch die one coronavirus test done previous administration. one!

edit: /s Hmmm. don’t remember asked.  Family issues. Visa issues. Work issues. There's plenty reasons. ID cards also anyone staying longer 6 months, could already 10 months planned 12  I'm moderately worried, sure. rest us outside cult vote him, fine, reason non-republican loyalist vote splits, could trouble. think knows that, counting it. Sadly pretty good. Dems could literally picked head cabbage Joe Biden. Biden excite base. incoherent ramblings help. Trump occult like following vote (old white boomers, people afraid change, ect). voting Trump. Imagine play JAWS lol right hate easiest way suck money government without needing provide much return. education, infrastructure, social security, medicine, etc actually need provide something value American people. kind testing, type 1 2 errors bound happen. Type 1 errors, commonly known false positives, much desirable acceptable false negatives.

In words, better safe sorry.  everyone needs vaccinated end crisis. actually strategic vaccinate, probably don’t need vaccinate many. Nobody talking ending December. returning less normal then.

And far they’ve halved development time vaccines, sure shorten production time. finishes November that’s you’ll know wins again? Zinc hydroxychloroquine known work well it. Yes, think useful know POTUS doing. bad, let record showing do. Also, gotta keep tabs dude, impact important global ignore. actually true? It’s going HHS, actually White House?

... initially thought CDC HHS wasn’t quite different. Would appreciate explanation anyone knows works Pretty much thinking. store small town lived brief period dollar store, EVERYWHERE small rural America seems. gotta ask - say that? I’d believe it.

Edit: did. actually fucking said that. Unlike you, brought useful facts ""Canada America"" ""Kids die lot school pandemic.""

Thank service. good question wish knew more. something public employee, legally protected. possibly pur unions negotiated collectively bargain us regarding unfair wages. imagine boils fact striking could cause undo harm children, that's best guess. negative repurcussions striking illegally work twofold cause teachers go it: takes advantage empaths want harm kids (a point constantly reinforced throughout society--we suppossed ""do children"" don't, selfish terrible awful teachers), puts much stake since could sued licenses lose livelihood. imagine teacher willing put hassle striking threats really love much; know do. also know strikes happened states illegal, super rare really pay. unprecedented times, however, idea would work terms something like this, employees fear safety large scale (Also, longer simply state issue). really willing cut forever lack visits 1 year? that's credible threat calling bluff, feel sorry you.  Lol. Election. Good one! We'll lucky there's civil war go pandemic November. *long enough...* They've lightly exploiting us while. let us national parks labor laws, people get petit bourgeoisie pretend rich. move out, they'll really start turning screws. Ever Bangladesh? get cancer every time read this. Even worst case gonna billions *each* day, unless Double COVID-19 starts thing. Yup definitely understand. hope don’t deal many shitty people It’s Invisible Chinese Virus. 😆 might surprise boat stunt doubled carbon footprint 2 crew members fly. 

What originally one individual flying attend conference became two individuals flying help said kid attend conference let facts get way white saviour. Remind 2 years. suppose, given expense get card like (couple thou), would want to? It’s fly in, fly kind situation, reason card they’ve provided proof they’re staying it’s resident country. government even tried sanctions virus, even trying anymore? fine Sadly terrifyingly, 50%. Easter, 2022. 1 15 somewhere near estimate Americans COVID? Yes fine numbers Canada, country completely lost control situation, America, many months schools shut down, cases much lower Nationwide. 

Is KFC open? think I'm smelling double down! new campaign manager must one foot reality. information deserves attention generally gets. Government clearly problem really true? feel like was, would happen wealth powers politics. dont listen experts, listen leaders wisdom take account experts say. keep listening experts, thinking side science. think much simpler that. military-industrial complex cares much government's cash. conquered oil, sucked trillions pocket think less half question. Exactly. impossible know certain due unable predict fast powers approve use vaccine general population. guess would shows efficacy safe fall see legislators approve fast possible. Economies struggling like we've never seen before. think serious incentive get public quickly possible. Wow.  Maybe sheeple follow lead. people it?

How believe claims, time time?  poorest people protected. want Fauci contradicting him. importantly, want anyone else getting attention him. there’s actually 40,000,000 cases instead 4,000,000 means 12% Americans currently virus. Yayyy Glad see one balls! Well least one state experimenting herd immunity!

Same Texas/Arizona. Someone gotta guinea pigs  'inflated'. perfectly reasonable accuracy test, infact fucking excellent. ~99.8% accuracy. Good work.  elephant room fact that:

The younger cohort responsible infections per age group, hence survivability.

In addition, doctors know LOT combat virus, hence less fatalities severe cases.

That among others deaths C19 high first surge. it. wrong Despite **all** evidence contrary.  Yup, living country many assholes. go spit swapping orgies? Less cases last Tuesday. Obviously deaths gonna go recent case spike. counties reported yet. says +1,039 today check worldometer. 

6/9 last higher total 1,104 deaths.  I'm sorry even 1 million deaths USA better put people Wuhan deal with... say

Even though im America want say

They're ordered to, believe already are. Trump even threatened send national guard hospitals comply. Really good!? That's freaking phenomenal. Cancer tests positive either YEARS research gone into. months accurately test specific strain coronavirus, one commonly mutated viruses around.

Fucking excellent work, know article reads like bad thing.  There's lag every Tuesday. numbers today still *up* comparatively. numbers began dip June steadily rose back July... like everyone predicted would based rising cases hospitalizations.

Go F yourself. New campaign management, too. bit trouble humpy sand horse, hey almost perfect score incredibly difficult test. mention Joe Biden totally pass it? [Here pesky data keep trying I'm concerned virus mutate, especially US NO-ONE abiding lockdowns, social distancing, gathering limits face masks.

Instead, incited rioting mass beach parties 

3.9 million cases million month ago 140,000 deaths. Um..I don't. gameplan run national debt managers ""forced"" tell people: ""hey look, gotta make sacrifices order pay debt, patriotic thing do"" try cut Medicare social security much possible. way figured touch medicare social security smallest backlash possible.

But pandemic happen accelerated that. tests, sun helps symptoms, less nursing homes infected, kids tested. lot factors could reasons lower deaths. see deaths increasing rapidly cali could well catch days/weeks  1000 now.

So much ""BUT DEATHS LOW. Take doomers!""

It ain't easy doomer. nothing lag weekend. Apparently less people die Sunday Monday, nice them. Well they're wasting old equipment guess. Must suck teen though. Especially older teens. time life become lot independent &amp; socially active. year two (or more?) taken away must suck. Imagine excited start Uni find online courses. Ouch. 140,000 dead Americans non-issue you? Cool cool cool used break 1k like 500 deaths NY. death 1000 cuts many places reporting 15 deaths. Things get really bad.

If want see failing hospital system looks like, look Rio Grande Valley Texas. Hidalgo county reporting 20+ deaths regularly population ~800,000, regularly 30, recently many 60+. feeling people Houston Dallas die outside hospital continue add crazy outlier Pneumonia deaths Texas 2020. Way provide real insights. won’t go well madhouse reddit. Man, big gripe American healthcare system based around profit margins. Hippocratic oath means nothing bunch suits broad meeting, therefore next nothing happens operating room. they're ones price hiking shit products treatments used America. Fucking assholes. It’s good testing. stop testing cases go down. day disappear. /s Right carousers, lot em. Old people vote. Medicare fine. I’ve got popcorn ready fall. There's also working memory capacity linked non-compliance social distancing guidelines early stage coronavirus outbreak

So Narcissists low-intelligence people refuse wear masks. question going get better *at all*, none less whether it'll get worse first. There's every probability point COVID 19's going become endemic United States, continue kill current rate unabated indefinite period. Think Smallpox Polio back pre-vaccine days. lo, much shit spewed, stink wild desperation. Corona say?  Heart breaking. fact copy/pasted burner phone problems. hired new campaign manager last week. imagine hospitals ""beds"" open. Thing start getting 80-90% occupancy patients stop coming in, already overwhelmed taking action. Patients diverted discharged earlier would be, treated ER new wards less equipment, ambulances wait hours get patients people die home ambulances busy queueing.

All while, may ""beds"" available, neither staff equipment ever care patient effectively exist paper.

This happened Sweden. Officials claim hospitals never overwhelmed beds available. Meanwhile, non-emergency care suspended, many patients admitted already critically ill barely thousands 70+ people died Spring ever saw inside hospital.

If elderly person elderly care got infected general assumption would die even simple treatment oxygen even IV nutrients. got morphine. sounds like conspiracy theory, (criminal?) negligence general apathy lives elderly authorities care management. There's massive blame.game now, word accountability literally exist Swedish language, government officials hardly ever personally held accountable anything resulting work. one goes people thinks covid bull shit. read people. Poll numbers somebody inner circle showing projections August. it'll ""I said wear mask got like this, ahead it"".

 previous recommendation mask couched enough double talk anti mask constituents fall right now, giving plausible deniability strength recommendation. ""Some people say..."" ... come on. [Here death graph showing flattening death curve rise insist ignoring data spreading false information?  Happened friend Texas. avid mask protestor. went visited parents. days later symptoms.

U don’t pay water, water bottles “Starve Beast” gets townspeople killed.   necessarily agree that. partially effective vaccine combined therapeutics could drastically reduce danger posed virus, even short eradication also American mentality place blame everything actually needs be. 

blaming immigrants taking jobs instead corporations exploiting immigrants cheap labor

blaming ""violent media"" video games mass shootings instead stupidly easy access guns poor mental health services

blaming millennials killing industries instead blaming stagnant poverty wages, student debt, little growth opportunities

it goes on. always someone something else's fault. seems pointed largely clarify [Boris Johnson's strong sincere hope able review outstanding restrictions allow significant return normality November earliest - possibly time Christmas literally lied. Trump February: *Looks like April, know, theory, gets little warmer, miraculously goes away.*

To fair, say year mind. I’m always confused titles. number total cases doesn’t go _down_, right? aren’t always hitting new high?

Am understanding correctly? Thanks! White House took CDC comes collecting testing data week, so, I'd suggest take numbers going forward big grain salt. Yup. Man spends whole life preparing something like he’s undermined fat, lazy, dumb reality tv show host. wonder factor recovered. Nearly half cases US recovered. 2nd highest positivity 7 days. might seeing non horrible performance let’s see Friday agree comment fully. considering this, ""fountain falsehoods""? whataboutism astounding. cough room then, charge em w/ attempted homicide. /s

Your logic joke. got brain? guess NBA,NFL,Nascar taking serious either plans play soon also. turning sad dark comedy! 

How people OK behavior? Doubleplus ungood. Oh course no, Jan March far realistic vaccines real deal I'm surprised he's again, considering hurts further. today exception. paper hoarding proves right.

I'm sure that. masks (and many people city did) fires previous summers. believed others (CDC/WHO, Surgeon General) said actually harmful ton them, since would touching dirty mask bunch. 

Without lies, would worn mask early March bus city. really appreciate lies. frankly admitted saying masks unnecessary conscious decision avoid complete collapse PPE supply front line healthcare workers. we're exact thing lockdown reopenings school reopenings point would even matter failed test? Wouldn’t matter followers. rest world already pretty maxed outrage.... next day does/says next dumb thing. serious question: failed test, would end presidency? I’m afraid answer probably no. UK, death totals include ""patients died hospitals England either tested positive COVID-19 positive test result received COVID-19, COVID-19 mentioned death certificate."" (NHS England).

Yea needs cited source. get you’re saying, seems like pretty safe assumption. Seems like common sense better change fighting inhaling 1 virus particle verses inhaling billion take extreme.

Yeah I’m denying it’s less severe, think needs accountability fact they’re testing - leaving population effectively dark almost full homie Huh? /r/technicallythemedian get flu vaccines year? new vaccine year's strain flu developed less year. process ""fast"" since new flu still many similar properties prior flu strains.

In similar vein, vaccines forms corona virus. like development vaccines flu, current Covid virus similarities prior strains allows ""fast"" development.

I think, qualified say sure, think aerosol experts still agree cloth surgical masks prevent transmission aerosols large extent. fact, Dr. Prather argues important droplet transmission alone. I’m sure science behind it- video linked explains important wearing mask properly describes plain old surgical mask. I've seen studies suggested far couple months back. 

We've always known viral load matters comes becoming infected virus, specifically covid19 we've studies showed potential lesser symptoms exposed lighter viral load. 

This one positive points masks, even crappy masks. Even protect 100%, even get unlucky end getting infected bit virus made through, still better odds wearing mask, reduced severity symptoms.

Dude r/coviddatadaily makes really good charts, one percent positive test rate time. Highly recommend. That's reason knew Idaho well. Makes sense  didn’t even fuck up. Don’t let idiots let misinformation take hold. experts said March *healthy* people didn’t need wear masks, didn’t know common infected people asymptomatic. realized asymptomatic people spreading virus recommended everyone wear masks. Anyone says Fauci Jerome said “masks don’t work” misinformed lying.

Edit - changed pronoun   shocking 900% Well I'm assuming testing people confirming covid died. possible people really going die happened covid? Sure. think huge margin, would really change figures much. Looks like they're following advice experts. weird see Americans care much 9/11 3000 dead, hand covid fucks given. funny, actually thinking earlier. Kind like get vaccinated small amount disease. Maybe that's also fatality rates shrinking even increases COVID. cases people getting lot less severe. good point. Furthermore, see log plot [daily new confirmed Covid-19 France Spain inflected upwards (indicating positive exponent growth rate). 

With said, US order magnitude countries currently, approximately 500% higher worst peaks. Furthermore, mask-wearing (sadly) become political issue US means we’re going enter fall - cold weather co-incidence respiratory illnesses likely make situation even worse spring - huge number active cases. Even Spain France spiked sudden (which seems unlikely given dedication public health measures thus far), they’re already much better place fall. Considering economic growth basically results 1. population growth 2. productivity improvements ... Yeah.. People dying definitely drag economy, buuuuut unproductive people dying far less so. West terrible issue demographics next decades. lot old dead people kind helps ease situation, fucked sounds. But, also lost consumers, longer need doctors/nurses old age, etc. really know.. probably hurts helps got feeling people really banking helping somehow.. Hey know like countries catch side eye wearing mask. Yeah imagine like backwards. Welcome Sweden! Florida labs busted ""cooking books"" tampering data reporting negative COVID-19 test results March July ~~Mostly False~~ **Absolutely least 45 COVID-19 testing laboratories Florida failed report negative test results** March July 2020, thus inaccurate positive testing rates recorded facilities. **However, 300 Florida labs report negative results time frame.** 

**so insignificant**  


FTFY Church 1000% separated government. Nothing good comes it. hope sarcasm. must be, right? really give shit people (or even self)? almost like one side cares science behind issue 140,000 American deaths.

Anyways, selfishness. Even people live (SoCal) choose wear mask claim choice ask wear it. logic pandemic hurts head

True.

Like, one could *force* everyone wear mask...then that's one thing. that's possible. Pretty noteworthy considering state third highest number cases deaths start. since completely flattened curve pretty good adherence mask wearing, social distancing restrictive measures.

Other surging states capable bringing control common sense measures responsibility. It’s decent model flattening curve. Lmao right What’s Brazil lately? seatbelt mask way comparable  know what's *really* surprising?

The fact casual Bane masks thing. Given weirdos profiteers, would think would popular summer fashion 2020.

I mean, nobody would even know put mask! Russell Wilson baby, tweeted he’s even sure it’s worth play all.  Yeah fact everyone teams touches ball thorughout game seems higher risk.

There's better things even seem unreachable :) needs get crackhead White House. TF talks like this...

Someone permanently head stuck ""the world stage"" mentality  First time? anything holds back car seat better nothing. comparison perfectly valid. Yep, totally agree.

We’re allowed play steam 80’s memes idk true. seems like might plausible, plausible necessarily true.  

We know reduces transmission people wear masks.  also know transmission reduced even masks low quality. masks leak reduce transmission, makes sense effect beneficial. makes sense that, blocking virus helpful, even mask block it.

Luckily sick 2 weeks able go back home back work. It’s fucking pandemic idiot, even bringing culture religion idiotic.

Actually it’s idiotic, it’s fucking disgrace add /u/biobio1337, Kansas also lets counties opt Governor Kelly's mask mandate. state legislature, controlled super majority particular party, made opt powers condition passing legislation deliver COVID-19 aid.

This led following hilarious Matryoshka doll mask rules:

1. Governor Kelly issues mask mandate.
2. Sedgwick County opts mask mandate.
3. Wichita, largest city Sedgwick County, county's population lives, passes mask mandate that's identical governor's. ""Its traveling cause ref didnt call it""

Yikes that's inappropriate position...why medical doctor say public health issue/pandemic? qualifies teacher speak health concerns? precisely what's bothering school opening discussions.

For holding gains, I've got counters too... 1929, took 25 years get initial investment back, bought top held. 1968 1982 (those dates memory, see chart go look) also Nasdaq 2000 2015 thereabouts. Japan still trying get back 1990 peak probably happen decades, ever (depending crises unfold...) considering far still it.

By way, printing money invented 2007, lmao, renamed something help obscure doing. pretended temporary thing obviously isn't. Fed already $1 trillion balance sheet going 2007. Classic right-w.ing talking points right Right shootings killings still crime. title misleading inaccurate. first case less month old. brother brought home kindergarten. mother sister also twice. would awkward America lot people expected go work sick. 

I think expectation especially high service industries one wants customers know employee sick. people saved often economy would obviously suffer, happens sluggish recession recoveries, would reach new equilibrium wealthy owned less working class owned more. simply wealthy save much larger percentage income, income spend often spend appreciating assets like real estate. greater spending funnels money wealthy.

Over time though, working class would acquire greater percentage buying power wealth saved more. I'm making reasonable jump, intellectually speaking, facts. Everyone entitled opinion. However, interesting everyone assumes there's possible chance hypothetical narrative. Amen! preschool teacher gets many colds year, really want become new norm: mask you’re sniffly coughing. Better yet, stay home. Happy see Boston resident  Lots lots well-trained woodchucks. Brazils gunning gaping asshole far right populist leader.

Yeah, scary honestly I'm much happier work I'm empowered something instead silently resenting assholes would put health risk sake Snickers bar.

It's risky either way tbh, I'd prefer accept risk rowdy customers instead risk COVID. main question concerning police, they've always come I've needed before. Technically still respect trespass incidents, decline respond trespass related mask policies? know, that's case embolden antimaskers become aware that.

No, quite different. akin randomly bumped standing near cliff.

I went hiking yesterday forgot mask. trail busy got dirty looks number people. mad like look face? No. mad could putting lives danger. science side.

I think risk quite small. held breath passing them. talk them. cough. I'm feeling sick. none changes fact raising risk death.

If mortally afraid, we'd stay home. that, we're trying live life. question is, right stand side trail breathing hard there's way get back car? know people dying virus?

I embarrassed. made mistake make again. keep making it? so, why?

You stopped chafing required wear seat belt. Likewise, stop chafing putting mask. I’m willing say shouldn’t happened things change there’s absolutely indication problem.

It’s states. achieve immunity say 50% hard hit places work social distancing masks, there’s chance could eradicate it. eradicate small pox, would form circle pt 0 vaccinate 100 thousand people. Yeah. It’s important note Fox interview aired today president explicitly stated since surgeon general fauci flip flopped masks, didn’t think necessary. asked lack federal mask mandate. political answer question demanded answer supported science. 

Think it: greater scientific need right trial error — whether it’s vaccine policy discourage spread. Science demands identify wrong answers order make almost certain conclusions — it’s basis scientific method. Instead, we’re force-fed anti-scientific policies post-truth / alternative-fact answers.

A Post-truth answer requires staunch opposition real facts — even deemed “political” some. Otherwise there’s always way post-truthers, like prez support him, weasel answers politicking. 

Rant over. Sorry. hope governor doesn’t come tout this, cause know happens does. hospital ship *was* used. treated non-covid emergencies regular hospitals room Brilliant, that's get fossil fuels ocean take later jobs make $$$. actually makes way sense that's overall plan, US govt actually doing.

Yeah, could states much worse?!?!?!?!?

Ok church say fuck laws Good job!!!!! Fair enough. think anger justified considering amazingly awful handling President governors, independent, call Republican tacitly supporting GOP currently stands. know fair paint everyone broad brush, Dems means amazing, proud Republican today well beyond comprehension. Sure sounds like he’s keen smearing covid around eh? data. actually intelligent people 👌 come thing people ever fucking care goddamn protests. Wah wah wah protests faaaaaaair Thailand, mandatory public transport, shops owners. Outdoors mandatory all.  
Yet practically everybody wears one anyway. True that. airlines record profits money going. Oh wait executives 10mill dollar bonus live San Diego mask wearing like 90+%. idea why- perhaps it’s biotech hub headquarters biggest innovators medicine? sure, I’ve felt super super comfortable midst pandemic Can't trust federal government right now. Remember school half class almost brain dead? people adults now. “Growing Body Evidence Suggests Masks Protect Wearing Them, Too”

As someone doesn’t really subscribe mass amount bullshit constantly spews forth society, say, COURSE FUCKING lying omission. Read response, even better read paper. states affected spikes due many tests completed Quest think Labcorp doesn’t really matter lot states independent testing capacity allowing people receive results quicker. 

For example; live WA UW 10k tests day overflow goes national labs know folks got results last week 24 hrs someone else still waiting. 

Not sure method madness test goes e.g. someone actual symptoms test sent local lab tight turn time vs roll testing site real reason believe infected. I'm leery tracing anyone. But, congrats sharing it! Crap. “Moisture retention, reuse cloth masks poor filtration may result increased risk infection.”

I reuse mask every day. getting myself/others sicker wearing one all? matter vaccine months antibodies, no? months everyone getting drop cases drastically boards.cruisecritic.com aware checks sent everyone look come back know talking about. country manage put man moon upon time? We’re obtuse science days doesn’t seem possible. Shit imagine bunch suit-wearing dudes line, snapping fingers coordination - heads virus emoji. 🦠 either barely read paper linked intentionally (and dangerously) lying omission. Firstly, section snipped specifically talking surgical masks, additional Disposable medical masks (also known surgical masks) loose-fitting devices designed worn medical personnel protect accidental contamination patient wounds, protect wearer splashes sprays bodily fluids.

So loose fitting masks designed prevent contamination patient wounds ineffective airborne pathogens. Makes sense. However, topic N95 consider use respirators community. Respirators tight-fitting masks protect wearer fine particles provide better protection influenza virus exposures properly worn higher filtration efficiency. However, respirators, N95 P2 masks, work best fit-tested, masks limited supply next pandemic.

You read fit testing Cool, fitted N95 masks theoretically help prevent transmission. people though. cloth lower-income settings, likely reusable cloth masks used rather disposable medical masks cost availability. still uncertainties practice face mask use, wear mask long used for. theory, transmission reduced infected members contacts wear masks, compliance uninfected close contacts could problem.

Oh look, paper link said cloth masks reduce transmission everyone wears mask. Kind like CDC saying now. Problem is, predicted, people complying.

Stop lying uninformed. make shit go longer. Honestly even think it’s obvious. It’s getting harder tell. team allowed 35 total members including jobs players.  Hotel staff provided Disney. team makes first round bring family Vaccine lootboxes. buy enough gems 1 1000 chance vaccine drop! get that's even phrase, right?

That straight whack. Really surprised took long, since they’ve selling masks entire time. already we’ve already Moon. 

We’ve also sending robotic missions Mars awhile also worry contamination those. 

The guidelines may updated bit, nothing really new. doesn’t “confirm” we’re sending humans Mars anytime soon. 

Also, NASA doesn’t say “manned” more. use words “human” “crewed” respect missions contain people. Yeah friend mine actually makes reusable masks laces. linked Etsy shop profile, sure link here.  sells ear loop style, also sells lace style. prefers lace style exactly reason describe, fit much better. 

Also, lot prefabricated, mass manufactured masks provide nose clips either necessary avoid sucking breathing air top mask. 

A poorly fitting mask is...better nothing, there's reason nurses wear masks tight. know Karens like show sale demanding sale price “they saw ad give price false advertising”

I bet poor store managers going dealing lot stupid people can’t deal flip flop. NeEd nEgAtIvE RatEs! (so debt burdens lessen) one you’re saying you’re prick world: ""Litterally stop completely buttfuck insane straight face"" 

Fox News: ""No."" mean anecdotally, area, large folks seem going normal.

The numbers reported actual economic sectors support this. travel aviation, retail restaurants, car buying credit debt, many, many job sectors down. tiny bump unemployment mostly came restaurants similar.

Spending right best flat, Senate allows expanded UI benefits lapse, fails offer direct stimulus masses, well shoring states... want see next month things come pass. rent/mortgage/utility reprieves expiring, student loan forbearance also going away...

Some Americans keep messing whole country. longer muck refuse truth situation, longer, protracted, lethal debacle becomes. Groups 40!. one cabin - communication positive cases.  I’d furious. Different attitude completely. watching since jan 23. Even people saying US would shitshow FREEDOM. 
We recent outbreak people paid government mandatory quarantine hotels upon return Au sex guards, took shop. cranky. 104 dead month within 2 weeks back state borders closed. Victoria shitshow. People wear masks know community transmission. wish would name shame involved. Army responsible guarding quarantine. leave. refuse. Make bring sheriff. can't arrest us all. predictable. Real curveball anti mask shit though. It'd bring economy back faster mandatory masks they'd still get properties cheap. Maybe smart people states buy lot Florida turn non laughing stock state, economy fully run ground. It’s almost like De Santis larger scale Trump trying set up. Except friends ones buy everything owned middle class. Unless rare cases really get recalled. take multiple samples person upfront There's way schools reopen. delays testing alone makes impossible. 

If takes 13 days get test results, half family dead get results. CDC says children really risk, superspreaders rest family. relatively people age 40 without single risk factor.

FAMILY, neighbourhood"" like wtf retarded fear mongering widespread race based violence streak unfold suburbia, like c'mon, THAT'S shooting definitely starts it'll end quick. Fucking Tucker Carlson man. Oh say pandemic killed 100s 1000s something concerned about, probably fear mongering eyes. fucked up. Guess I'm spending fall?

I follow government-required actions related virus get there. ugly American.  Yet another Trump Jr.

As least one many already... without even mentioning original douche. 

""Drain swamp"", ""Flush douche""? douchy.  ""I'd RaThEr FaMilY DiE vOtE dEmOcRaT"" We’re sorry, Canada Actually closer 3.5 million given USA's age distribution.

Even worse, number much higher health care system gets overwhelmed. Right medical professionals traveling states hotspots like Florida California, local people working double shifts. They're going become fatigued, human stamina limits, virus spreads areas medical staff travel ""hotspots"" entire country overwhelmed. Damn son maybe start thinking rest car windshield wipers. see jump Tuesday. thing happened Idaho. there’s lot people don’t wear masks go Dutch bro’s think it’s big deal since worker shack they’re car. It’s stupid dude.  Dwight Howard entered chat Thanos need him. method would work thst ruin planet.... replied point: poverty homelessness.

When we're talking homelessness, need keep conversation homelessness.

This difficult concept understand. long area seen 14 days cases decline preferably zero deaths 

Your kids safe anything. great, see link mobile. Apologies.

I like optimism, that. Allow copy paste said, think said, let's see match. - article "" also plans supply US 300 million doses time"".- ""The producers confirmed 300m doses available US September/October.""

Them planning something, happening different. easy that.

We even enough extra vaccine vials earth right now. 

""SiO2, signed [$143 partnership BARDA, asked ramp production 10 ml vials eightfold. BARDA contract mandated scale capacity make 40 million June, 80 million September, 120 million November... clear whether hit 40 million target yet.""

They making new substance called valor, plastic vial coated glass interior gates put billions production more, started May current production line would hundred million available jan 2021, billions available sometime end Q2 Q4.

We make distribute anything planet hundreds millions, much less billions.

And always account spoilage. stock loss issues ranging quality-control, transportation damage, storage damage, theft, transfer damage, HCP use damage. let mention theft again, black market massive - every form organized crime corrupt body going every juncture cycle (starting hacking lab work way trying physically steal supply).

Also, look testing debacle America.  


Issuing vaccinations require strict return visits, lot complicated. apples oranges. We've done around 30 million covid tests 5 months. basically cotton swabs far less perishable fragile, many free required payment processing. We're talking million vaccinations, paid for, administered far less locations testing (there's drive-through vaccines) ... going require military like operation needs set-up planned now.

Also, absolutely chance current powers organize national vaccination program, trigger every one conspiracy-insane followers, it'll left states. going smooth, fast effective.

Optimism good, remember making vaccine first step, (logistically, easiest step), much larger, time-consuming, complex operation. 


If expect anything 2021, would mean think people created ""COVID testing frontline"" capable operation exponentially larger, complicated controversial made hallmark anti-science &amp; government mandates. governor great job. heck wrote tweet. doubt did. Maybe realized certain segment followers ones wearing masks crafted tweet get comply.

If works thats fine. minority US. perfectly fine. Get hobby ""Part mandate educate nurture protect young adults,"" said Franco Taddeo, who's worked McGill's library system since 1990s. ""Honestly, father Canadian, would much rather students safety well-being present-day America."" Dealing similar issues Alberta Calgary clusters around bars, etc. spiking back (with 165 July 17, 106 July 18 97 July 19) good run getting ~40/day. Back 17 ICU weeks fairly regularly 10, 86 hospitalizations usually 50. 

I Southern Alberta surprised increase considering many see acting like all. city like 10 active cases months last week half gone 38 actives - aren’t big. Total cases since March 88....

I wish province would mandate masks - mean handed 40 million including Timmy’s - make must province wide. problem isn’t people mask, it’s people morals brains.

If government mailed masks people, much want bet people would burning Facebook videos talking “I’m going put government anthrax mask, siree!!”

They allowed. Sorry . still student loans, unless country move wage garnishment extradition bad debt agreement treaty, doubt US could anything. donate blood, get tested Nope copy pasted YouTube. think asymptomatic component makes unknown. show symptoms, get tested. lots unknowns unless test everyone regularly. Gaslighting. hot right now. That's exactly meant. guy pure failure. I'm confused, talking *equality outcome*, continue drive strawman? I’m conspiracy theorist nitwit. don’t want ^viral load mouth! Proof residence usually consists utility bill.  requirement insane. Ireland (which swamped ask labs Germany help) also require negative test stop self isolating. 

That said, Ireland still concerned open schools, despite less cases total new cases Florida 3 days. Yeah, suspect point lot Chinese pretty much throwing things wall seeing stuck. Interesting taken long anyone pick IFN though. That's terrible. /r/COVID-19 good one

Otherwise, I’ll read general news always ignore stuff that’s like “healthy 42 year old dies!!” know enough virus point know EXTREME statistical outlier

In general would suggest educating actual stats, especially IFR age, disease. It’s eye opening. Secondly, ignore sensationalist headlines. think figured out....

They want keep conversation solely focused people impoverished *before* COVID facing homelessness. So, purposes conversation, mean tenants. landlords, “housed” therefore privileged.

So, basically, gathered person thinks landlords struggling right don’t deserve kind consideration thread *were* privileged. current struggles less significant because, before, weren’t struggling much tenants were. tenants deserve help now.

Shouldnt able stay home stay safe? know thinking it, president, would make masks mandatory?

It interesting question. came conclusion, would not. think needs state like Hawaii Alaska incredibly different needs Florida New York. can't provide large blanket US, large diverse need. argument made deciding really done state level.

That said though, would probably also monitor states, look gross negligence rejection science (like Florida) probably mandate masks something like positive rate testing 10% 1 day row. example number, would something similar that. 1968 marked first teacher strike nation—it also last Florida.

Lolol :) “spreading hate fear” looks like you, you’re softer sound. can’t handle negative posts sub fucking pandemic, stick r/aww add something conversation. 97% infected COVID survived. try doom gloom kind-hearted life story elderly couple perfectly healthy post-COVID. highest estimate I’ve seen 40% asymptomatic. places mask usage seeing 95% asymptomatic, obvious cause-and-effect occurring. Small business’s shouldn’t either then, correct? yah.. instead got postcard Donald Trump nonsense. 

No supplies though. highly doubt would happen. would break legitimacy government pretty quickly. USA actually real banana republic moment. Quitting disqualify every state. Oxford vaccine got money 8 candidates chosen Operation Warp Speed. $1.2 billion $2+ billion pool money. see news Oxford vaccine other. It’s Trump’s horse race. 

My guess heard name Oxford thought prestige. 

Trump bet presidency Oxford vaccine.  Exactly. properly enforced two week quarantine simple effective way prevent infection still allowing students - benefit student school. overly optimistic Oxford Vaccine?

What know far testing produces immune response...sometimes 1 dose. Sometimes 2. &lt;--- part good.

But, point...they know prevent virus. Also, 60% people tested sort reaction like fever chills. Plus, effectiveness know. Like 50% effective? More? Less?

I definitely want vaccine, feel like way premature think thing end covid certainty. think good many companies working vaccines chances greater 1 work well. Like Daddy, like sub. Dude. One leading epidemiologists country, Dr John Ioannidis, said covid far less deadly originally thought lockdowns end. dozens experts like agree. 

Stop acting like bizarre opinion. ...I many questions Stock market still fine.

Said stock trader January, 2007. Last I've heard Phase 1 40ish participates. inject 1000 people? getting government money. turn central fan keep circulating outside air even AC isn’t running. hope that's case company definitely need money. Business still steady. definitely is, otherwise death rate closer 5% less 1% sure... seems less 1%, incredibly contagious fast moving spread makes enough people sick enough put massive strains healthcare systems (and causes people die stuff).

As stands, *diagnosed* COVID closer 5% chance dying, hospitalized obviously goes lot higher... Mask use California even close 100%. month ago would say 50% less. recently cases climbed, improved, there's still significant vocal chunk Californians refuse wear masks.

I'll also say enforcement lockdown really spotty. lot sheriff/police departments anti-mask refuse enforce lockdown rules regarding gyms, restaurants, etc. businesses stay completely open operate impunity.

The thing is, once, mean forever immune. Let's say takes 2 - 3 years reach threshold herd immunity, think people got first 1.5 years low enough anti-bodies get again?

And vaccine rushed much, there's much news (see - propaganda keep markets up, news always comes markets start selling off) good results, even aim level herd immunity instead saving lives months achieving immunity via vaccinations?

None makes sense, unless follow demographic economics... West enter several decades decline la Japan 90s today due demographics (too many old people take care of, enough young people working / paying taxes take care = long-term / secular economic decline)... COVID kind fixing problem letting run rampant definitely solving USA's problem demographics actually bad places like Canada Europe. killing million old people actually could fix demographic issues.

I'm saying that's over-arching plan / conspiracy, heartless capitalist perspective, makes economic sense wipe older generation, fucking sad/miserable is.

California slows growth = good

Texas slows growth = ""its still June 1 bad"", even though slowed much.   would mandate immediately. Id leave discretion states, like whether mandate outdoors, would absolutely government buildings businesses offering public accomodation. would give target hit could start rolling back regulations, states coming target wouldnt necessarily need implement start with. would worry places like Hawaii Alaska much already existing supply chain problems different infrastructure demands shortfalls, wouldnt take nearly much burden systems. conserve PPE healthcare workers

I believe slightest, even true really fucked up. again, believe all. 

I think decades running medical industry ""just time"" MBA administrators left us stockpiles. think also administration pushing hard masks wanted everything seem fine. dozen ways feds could secured PPE supply chain reached consumers. 

Hospitals (in normal times anyways) going fucking CVS buy PPE. blatant damaging lie, masks ineffective, also ""doing healthcare workers."" buy minute.

Nobody rational acts like this, act like risks reopening can't possibly worse risks closing equally irrational.  Opening shit good problem gets worse end closing longer it. also live Japan. Firstly, simply living somewhere qualify anyone expert topic.

I think point he's making regardless Coronavirus, testing whatever, hospitals packed. getting full, sure, nothing like we're seeing USA. 

Ok they're testing, get that, yes, concerning, but, surely virus impact countries seen, see rise ""pneumonia"" related deaths? 

I'm anxious anyone else lives here, truth whatever happening here, *lot* less severe happening elsewhere.

Blame someone else US mantra...and piss poor examples come top down. ""train"" mean? hear best, beautiful tests world America! SAD compared theirs. im texas, took 16 days testing get positive result, then, gotten second, negative test, stopped feeling sick all. didnt even feel bad first place, got tested roommate did. Hospitals overwhelmed. didnt ask goddamn thing either, yet started blathering honeymoon anyway. Pretty chatty someone isnt tolerant same. knowledge medicine stops serious symptoms. Younger people infected. Nothing else. caves size cantaloupes. Literally said unfortunately comment bud, also lying.

I actually care deaths, think people like try make seem like there's nothing worry absolutely disgusting part death cult whose sole purpose make stonks line go up. Fucking disgusting. 2nd week testing. big decrease; 1st week 30.

They're preparing enter ""bubble"". required 3 negative tests spaced 24 hours apart enter Canada. Anyone testing positive past wed thurs denied.

There also groups players isolated because, though tested negative, came contact positive case. That's believed happening Boston Calgary, though can't know sure players agreement bars NHL commenting specifics. 

The players exactly fucking around. want play (also bubble, violations range fines loss draft picks) learn disease, it’s possible non–health care workers higher risk exposure may recommended wear N95s, general public, still doesn’t seem make sense.

If N95 mask mitigate risk contracting virus even little bit...that seems make sense me. Ah, Missouri. tourist mecca. Thanks meth. Thanks. Get basement. see plenty people part wearing masks staying home away people volunteering food banks. home spreading hate fear waiting government help you.. haha.

An outdated video clip Dr. Anthony Fauci circulating social media — giving false impression currently advising public wear face masks. Fauci, like health officials, recommends wearing cloth face covering distances least six feet can’t maintained.

Full Story
On April 3, Centers Disease Control Prevention reversed earlier position use face masks COVID-19 pandemic announced recommending people wear face coverings public, citing new studies transmission virus causes COVID-19.

“We know recent studies significant portion individuals coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) even eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) transmit virus others showing symptoms,” CDC said announcement. “In light new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings public settings social distancing measures difficult maintain (e.g., grocery stores pharmacies) especially areas significant community-based transmission.”

Despite new guidance, dubious Facebook pages groups — advocate alternative medicines, conspiracy theories anti-vaccination messages — recently circulating outdated recommendation use face masks. pages sharing March 8 video clip CBS’ “60 Minutes” showing Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, saying: “There’s reason walking around mask.”

But point early March, CDC recommended conserving face masks, short supply, health care workers COVID-19 showing symptoms. So, Fauci gave answer line CDC recommendations time.

Here’s Fauci told Dr. Jon LaPook, chief medical correspondent CBS News, clip circulating social media:

LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it.

Since then, science around novel coronavirus evolved, Dr. Dean Winslow, infectious disease physician Stanford Health Care, explained interview FactCheck.org.

In early March, patients tested public health officials didn’t yet know people could spread virus without showing symptoms, said Winslow.

“That known point,” said.

Winslow noted Fauci appeared making two points interview. pushing back idea mask could protect wearer infection, emphasizing importance measures, maintaining distance least six feet people.

Both things still apply, according CDC, explains website point wearing mask “is protect people around infected symptoms.”

In appearances aired PBS NewsHour April 3 May 12, Fauci noted importance physical distancing and, line evolving public health recommendations, added cloth face coverings used public.

But Facebook pages didn’t share up-to-date interviews. Instead, shared old interview without noting date.

For example, Facebook page supports widely debunked conspiracy-theory video, “Plandemic,” shared old clip May 6 caption, “Dr. Anthony Fauci: ‘There’s reason walking around mask.'” That’s opposite advice Fauci giving time.

Editor’s note: FactCheck.org one several organizations working Facebook debunk misinformation shared social media. previous stories found here.

They’ve even told horror stories I’m going go detail order respect anonymity. people sure already dying based lack resources I’ve heard first person accounts that. It’s pretty scary. media always bit behind curve tend tone things bit. Ooohhhh gonna bad, think shortage teachers before, wait till rona starts taking out!!! Sad part lot em probably great teachers irreplaceable. I'm sorry vote requested amount. Right? wear mask wish everyone whole thing still fucking blows. I’ve canceled 2 trips looking forward to, haven’t seen friends months, sports, etc. didn’t realize selfish think sucks ass

I don’t wanna deal anymore either. top I’m nurse it’s hear about. nothing young rich employer wants pay get tested make money, thats fine. prob depends situation. open air worried respiratory droplets, anything help. poorly ventilated space people may sick aerosols build prob want N95.

it's insane.. increase prices due speculation. due combination builders cautious 2008 lower interest rates. That's bubble. 2008 bubble driven speculation. Man, bad crowd won’t go wild. dunno seems like lot active clusters. Also R 1.2 really great think? 

I could paranoid though. 20 cases city today single digit increases month decided stop leaving home except groceries.  amazing news i'm confused everyone comments saying September release date vaccine? Boris Johnson quoted article saying early next year likely, still incredible news months later September. important temper expectations since we're clearly finish line.

Ugh, can’t get single thread sub without coming across fatphobic comments mentioned another comment depends ""overwhelmed hospitals"" defined as. There's consensus far I'm aware.  didn’t. That’s literally untrue. bet felt really righteous type, cares it’s true, right? Ok, let’s go direction.

Why hasn’t cities mentioned huge surges? title post symptom severity. top level comment said “duh masks stop coronavirus” without mentioning entire topic posts title about. pointing maybe missed I’m getting downvoted lol Yep, one retarded things see weekly basis. kids gets it, get too. Considering many times virus already mutated many parts world may difficult impossible make 100% effective. even able slow local infections would enough everyone got vaccine stop mutating spreading again. appreciate concern leg work. upper middle class 86 might able talk it. dad passed away three years ago she’s recently lost several friends. wouldn’t say she’s ready go, also doesn’t want extraordinary means keep alive. put perspective, 646 children staff killed US school shootings combined, including college students since first school shooting 1746. Even 10% schools open person stay open, lose many kids school shootings, ever. president one day, make likely. aware Canada still finding bunch cases, right? Here's [nice showcasing progress. second wave happen without Americans. They're New Zealand, they're like Australia second wave now. Thanks sharing medicines list :( probably great resource somebody else though. Deaths lag, younger people average infected, treatment better US far testing months ago.  minimal restrictions virus rapidly stopped spreading way infected even 1/3 population. spend trillion year dod, dhs, intelligence agencies, “security” related departments.

Paywall Strongly disagree. state sets precedent shutdowns safety protocols well money pay unemployment. *Illinois entered chat* actually read article. simple, yet difficult some. least still constitution! /s someone younger social media, pretty much 95% people know ages 22 35 acting like everything normal. Crowded bars, parties, etc. also anecdotally, parents friends also seem trying hard avoid friends public places either. wild see much people don't/won't care. folks even deniers/hoaxers might well based living right now. think people convinced staying inside/away everyone couple weeks might well death sentence brains broke. Idk zero evidence. Got it. 🤫   friend lives told feels mask wearing widespread there. I’m sure true anecdote is, so, shows. Hopefully it'll appear 5 minute crafts. order save tests, maximum batch size needs chance eliminating entire batch, meaning needs chance everyone negative.

So, let's assume positivity rate 20%. could also call negativity rate 80%.

80%^n n number tests batch &amp; needs 3 higher (the math 2 different, honestly help much anyway), even 3 ends super helpful usually.

In case, n = 3, yielding 51.2% chance eliminating whole group.

Demonstrated: 20% positivity means 1 every 5 tests positive. 

That means group 15 people would discover 3 positives. Worst case scenario, none group, like (N = negative, P = positive):

* NPN
* PNN
* NNN
* NPN
* NNN

So, worst case scenario, run 5 tests initially, need retest everyone 3 5 groups. 

That's 5 + (3+3+3) = 14 

The reality always perfect like that, that's would average out. 14 tests 15 people. stellar, definitely better.

The nice thing conduct testing, also help drive positivity rate down, turn helps even testing.

Imagine positivity rate 10% instead 20%. Instead testing groups 3 could test groups 6. Even better: point start method ""layers"". Let's say group 6 tests positive - test 6, split 2 groups 3 test again! testing batches removing approximately half total population, negative, we've created new sub-population double positivity rate. among times discover group 6 least 1 positive it, still 20% people actually positive. saw above, groups 3 work 20% positivity rate, reduce total number tests required.

This looks like played group 30 people 10% positivity. Again, 3 people appear different groups:

* PNNNNN
* NNNNNP
* NNPNNN
* NNNNNN
* NNNNNN

So run 5 tests, eliminating last two groups. 

* PNNNNN
* NNNNNP
* NNPNNN
* ~~NNNNNN~~
* ~~NNNNNN~~

If tested every person individually positive groups, would run 18 tests, yielding result 23 tests 30 people. Definitely better. But, ""layering"" technique instead split groups groups 3 eliminated negatives again, would look something like this:

* PNN | ~~NNN~~
* ~~NNN~~ | NNP
* NNP | ~~NNN~~
* ~~NNNNNN~~
* ~~NNNNNN~~

In scenario ran 5 tests initially, ran 6 tests new, smaller groups. point could test rest individually (9 tests), yielding:

5 + 6 + 9 = 20 tests 30 people.

The best part ""layering"" technique described actually need keep track individual sample group / subgroup / etc.

In first group 30, eliminated 12 people. 18 get tested scrambled split arbitrary groups 3 still works.

I sure good programmer could come better algorithm that, crazy difficult implement. upper limit number individuals single batch point would defined probability (as mentioned before) physical limitations many different samples mix together without effectively diluting positives nothing, making much work create super-batches spending us much energy mixing would testing.

EDIT:
Muh. 50% number right, assumption makes life easier excluding edge cases. Boo.

So, let's call rate R exclude entire group ""exclusion rate"" where:

R = (1-P)^n

Technically, order save tests need 50% chance exclude, need exclude *enough* tests least ""break even"". Said another way, discovering single group eliminate must require fewer tests testing whole equations:

n(1-P)^n said, still practical requirement saving enough individual testing justify process, reality would probably end rule thumb that's developed using starting point. think one things that, prior pandemic, made sense. pandemic still may technically illegal, bet would hard find jury would unanimously agree. texted mom forgot name program. used use company  get meds super cheap free remember never paid it.

True. don’t think fair. Teachers deserve job stability. also believe schools would perform better didn’t high turn rates. much time spent learning ropes, getting relocated, learning new ones. I'm happy good news well noticed it. I'm still worried backlog tests. hospitals access quick tests ER staff, people getting tested community wait 5-10 days. could useful contact tracing, parts country still employ number daily cases getting. Triage apparently includes ability conform treatment infection control protocols. wonder AI could search someones social media history credit card reports cell phone locations try give index ability maintain isolation.

certainly organ donations much based compliance. poor underinsured list part can't take time work lack ability socially isolate transplant drugs. course would not? I'm taking single vaccine created right 'merica! shit comes US within year we'll using metric drinking tea come pastel green can!! title sounds strange idea really neat. I'm Brit I'm also envious excellent institutions posh people get attend.

Edit: know hoi polloi get money certainly makes process hell lot smoother. Kudos guys mentioned article: sustained accelerating effort government business exterminate Indigenous. ""Health workers charged federal government protecting country’s Indigenous populations"" strange phrase read branches government either active directly in, passively tolerant of, flat genocide. People prisons need profits. Whoooosh canadian, NUH HUH! Fix fucking shit coming here. Yep!! proven successful trials always end early control arm moved becoming another treatment arm well. common life threatening diseases, assume pandemic probably follow route well.

Thanks taking time explain reasoning!

I certainly appreciate title expressed asymptomatic rate definite terms discussed loosely. Quite one location discussed outbreak occured single want wearing mask get bad stuff virus cause severe illness. And, yes, we've absolutely seen countries even settings outbreaks everyone masked, there's, like, 95% rate symptoms all. actually outbreak chicken factory, outbreak seafood factory country. everyone masking. 95% asymptomatic rate infection. hope ever judge today hears case Kemp brought Mayor embarasses fuck him, like verbally. Hell, Savannah got care package PPE Cuomo yesterday Kemp say shit mask mandate Kemp said shit. vile , ignorant , petty little man. part problem. happening India. Many many many people asymptomatic awareness mask usage abundant.  Social distance tolerable? guys even socially distancing let alone trying make tolerable. me, sports wait means tests getting right place.

Americans already gotten used going deeply, deeply debt due higher education. primary secondary education? cost living already increased US Europe much staying home one's child first years become viewed privilege rather right. term ""entitlement"" become insult rather word rights. forgotten children entitled education, people entitled administration, public institutions, laws provide reasonable possibility achievement middle class lifestyle government regarding health, education, transportation, retirement, working conditions, safety, civil rights.

If angry, be. Things getting better people USA, worse. don’t agree value judgement “acceptable” safety flatly made without showing acute long term mutagenic detrimental immunological effects (for example, exposed different viruses). statement misleading suggests safety without actually evaluating many aspects safety. 

But deception amplified mass media, typical sound bite reading something like this: “The preliminary data shows safe induced strong antibody response vaccinated volunteers, suggesting effective vaccine could within reach.” experimental COVID-19 vaccine safe produced immune response early-stage clinical trials healthy volunteers, data showed Monday...” course collusion, amplified disinformation.   cool. Thank open mind. think emphasized needs masks medical personnel many times interview, may glossed downplaying masks part people. *laughs Chinese, Vietnamese, Finnish German* Contact tracing apps track you. keep log phones vicinity of. location information involved. Perhaps somewhat deliberately hyperbolic, legitimately first develop effective vaccine it’ll save millions lives large chunks global economy. People dumb. faith humanity already teetering edge.

Science: Staying home safest

Fauci: Fuck that, I'm going go baseball game.

Hahahahahaha I've seen speculation we're finding 1/5 cases tests. (I'm skeptical, WOW that's true.) seems unnecessarily uncivil based exclusively fact disagree me.

And instead asking sources, provided thread, trying bully strangers internet.

Interesting. Absolutely. millions Americans want come pay fees apply. Free money government. Oh definitely sides.

Man puts condom 6 months contracting herpes. That’s good also start taking swastikas keep reporting “do go policies” Bingo. guys shitting virus that's 95% asymptomatic? Reviewing comment history shows point reference arguments slippery slope fallacy. willful ignorance display really surprise me, certainly pathetic. Dr. Fauci devil here. individuals involved extortion PPE bad guys. 

He scientist, supply chain logistics coordinator. 

People lost lives many reasons, places going lockdown, businesses continuing operate like normal long, elderly people nursing homes getting proper care. Also, lack PPE healthcare workers. 

Fauci one job, make responsible others people's bad actions Ah, right. marketwatch quoted, ""Obama born Kenya, Antonin Scalia murdered, millions fake votes cast Hillary Clinton."" way law constitution written, work them. agree that’s be, it’s not. DeSantis isn’t going protect us, mother father law, friends 30+ years district lose retirement  ""Properly Enforced"" get used Reddit hating right leaning political parties constantly someone able change great news like Tory-bashing they're really worth time  contradicting, adding nuance.

They hate unemployment People need wise fact 100% numbers game people power. case, black family so, far DeSantis concerned, two less potential opposition votes. gives zero shits actual people lost lives.

If COVID disproportionately affecting minorities, communities color, poor, they'd falling get things locked cleaned up.

By time starts impacting wealthy powerful vaccine easy affordable (for them) priority access to. friend exhibiting multiple symptoms covid since Saturday, close contact someone middle last week tested positive.

Despite this, refusing get tested one thing, also refusing self isolate, planning going tommorow go church get food. anything living states away? hes taking advice get tested go seriously teacher steps foot schools opening soon huge part problem whatever happens them.  virus around long time know works dangerous contagious is.  inexcuseable indefensible ANYONE putting others harms way point.  Parents need keep children home teachers need stay home.  really simple that.  one cares stupid laws right addressed later follow laws want protect make stand.  saying one wearing masks stores.

Well quite say fairness. Right personal choice. see people shops wearing masks. 

Again dont know like California markedly less busy right am. really started easing things maybe 3 4 weeks ago, even there's already need local lockdown one city. Given weak testing infrastructure India -- compared U.S. -- absurd claim U.S. epidemic definitely worse India's epidemic. trying get people work stay home many cases Great. Covid partiers yet one creative idea. Idk either, it’s true amongst elderly know. sure logic connects Lol deserves lot amended fact. Proskauer's up-to-date summary. search ""increases"" (they use word raise). There's language evidently disqualifies owner taking increase. disallowed partners requesting PPPs, course, Partners get draws addition salaries. long headcount salaries remained same, owner take whatever want. can't exceed existed prior disaster. they're going name name see got what.

If find language contrary, I'd love see it, think will.

The owner could not, vacuum give raise loan, owner laid 12 people took back 10 used take salary 30k, could take salary someone 120k (reducing 99k) still get forgiveness that. There's prohibition. Wichita, Sedgwick County Health Department  turn? ""housed landlord"" ""housed"" HOUSE.

Yes. Homelessness implies housing. Landlords housing. Welcome words mean. 

When landlords longer houses, reside, become homeless. Lack housing = homeless. 

Currently, we're taking conversation homelessness. housed people. Please keep tenants pay rent, landlord can't pay mortgage, bank takes house them. previously ""housed landlord"" becomes homeless. house = homeless.

And, *again*, that's would included conversation homelessness. Homeless people included conversations homelessness.

You get included plight homeless homeless. pretty fucking simple old you? sincerely need know. I've never met adult zero idea housing works.

*Housing homelessness.*

I literally author organize housing-first programs across nation I'm telling definition homelessness lack goddam house.

Your problem, entire time, want group housed people homelessness I'm letting you.  Thank comment!
Just one note, economics GDP growth tied demographic growth, part GDP growth literally comes directly it. course that’s factor though. Asymptomatic...

Or they're experiencing *different* symptoms infected eyes much greater proportion. disease gain foothold without ever going lungs. ACE2 receptors also ton places (like corneas). Two it's. vaccine effective without booster. demand issue. It’s pandemic issue

This sort tax cut mostly goes people like wife don’t need it. Don’t forget utilize telehealth counseling! &lt;3 know cotton mask better nothing protecting myself, mainly wear one consider courtesy people.

Edit: also wear mask cashiers can’t smell alcohol breath 6 morning it’s legal buy alcohol again. Ontario starting open bars. I'm fucking livid. guess I'm hoping geopolitical separation Oxford America ensures comes American monopoly vaccine established. within People's interest licences produce vaccine sold manufacturers around world, otherwise American healthcare system citizens, rest world. hell. We’re getting results back 18 hours KS side KC. test? 3, give take million. Lmao load bullshit.

First can't quantify things comparison completely baseless. Second, we're talking generation kids raised Karens Kyles. could easily argue opposite saying alone. I'm black american trying build career get country many years. Thank lumping us rest dysfunctional shitheads rest US trying keep us out. Go hell. Someone leak soon comes ouy 1) think look US entirety, much variation states. Compare Sweden Michigan. Michigan fared much worse even strictest shutdown measures there. also compare fairly well terms climate population. Michigan seeing steady rise cases.

2) Good point!

3) sure that. UK, France, Spain, Italy got hit pretty hard. Well...for positive cases testing. doubt lot schools colleges that. Like test everyone returning, won't.

You'll probably see teachers professors get sick. one thread ever gotten flu shot? Vaccines always free private insurance America. Insurers would always rather pay small fee make immune instead paying astronomical fee hospital visit, later. might try, sure supply there. know we're supposed get 300 million doses end year, still takes time distribute it. hope November 4th, I'm trying realistic optimistic. seem ignore rate false positives. trust spurs, thats whats great team— really dont trust players. Great. mom works four year olds private religious schools daycare program said preschool 8th grade. Great kids. choose home. 57 year old mom 4 preexisting conditions fucking choice gets go contract virus die?????????? Fuck  US presidential election please, trump credit idiots fall it. Actually good signs US today. Cases last weeks numbers testing same. Could measures put place states impact (masks / gym &amp; bar closures) maybe citizens taking upon limit contact. looked numbers closely California seems stagnant, Texas dropped bit, Florida stagnant. Maybe early call trend, encouraging numbers going up. view England world pretty reductive. 

I vote Tories, oppress you, steal credit anything, I've got beef you. Yet ""English people"" enemy.

I'm saying guy's right sure coming great either. actually does. people asthma would think use protective gear must highly involved allergens cause asthma symptoms. name Renata Vasconcellos even decency say think it’s right thing wrong. No, keep double talk people saying... Yeh financial crisis pandemic different. 

They unemployment ideological reasons Yeah, probably go smoothly. Seeing Americans totally comply trying end pandemic. I'm sure everything work perfectly. It’s still low since June it’s progress Waaaaaaaah sooner later choice Numbers go White House CDC. Numbers fudged. example: Today first Monday since change. typically spike numbers weekend. We're seeing today number new deaths 537 100 Sunday. New cases actually Sunday. surprised numbers continue drop August try make Trump look good. great park! I've twice, love UP; Spent days bit NE St Ignace last summer plans spend 2 months summer, well, yah happen.

That said Rocky Mtn National Park Estes Park, CO require masked times trails, pull passing others. implement reservations timed entry park summer, needless say, lot irritated tourists rolling Estes without reservations, slots already booked weeks. Unhappy campers, lot them. one gives fuck that.  Schools reopening going add thousands already high death toll.  one going protect us us.  one destroy career protect life lives loved ones are.  People need take stand hope putting stop insanity.  government serves us way around politicians need reminded that. slaves serfs. work us. Yeah...a lot said could take 4 years ever.

That said, progress hope Oxford vaccine...but think may work progress takes several iterations get right. us working don’t need tax cut! can’t go nothing spend save it

Help unemployed small businesses customers. get point. Israel didnt open correctly social distancing etc. school *can* open safely like school small rural allowed to? case city-wide declarations inappropriate? maybe different lives. idk Great points. Love exp  Good points Kigali gorgeous modern. country 3G launched like 2013, many people cell phones even smart phones. many aspects feel similar US. 

Still, remote areas, health care infrastructure far behind. spent time typing medical records newly acquired computer, records previous years written hand notebooks. Several people met lived homes running water, electricity, glass windows. 

I hope control spread, healthcare system modern standards rural areas definitely lacks funding. Missouri swing state long time. family Missouri believe Rona happening election year. None Missouri family voted Republican.

Nobody family even bought blue car, except grandfather decades born grandmother made return red one. Antidotal know, same. Monday hospitals report weekends take numbers. Wait tomorrow data. Okay bad Japanese though. figure least sentence structure German English would pretty similar (Japan switches things around) that's bit reassuring language issues hearing it. enjoy learning Japanese though (at least writing reading). Learning languages fun stress actually earning grade it.

I loved Japan. kind made realize behind country is. know countries obviously Japan terms things public transportation, low crime rate, able afford rent skilled worker started looking jobs US traits enjoyed much lived Japan, really find cities like that. Apparently lot countries lower gun violence better public transportation universal healthcare lot even cheaper rent (at least comparing big cities big cities). Japan, absolutely loved able walk around city feel safe getting around bus sub easy do. even suburbs Japan still buses sidewalks shops. kind shock going Japan back living south there's sidewalks poorly kept sidewalks 1 every 3 shops boarded up. Like reverse culture shock. 

I live south anymore actually live state enjoy barely afford place (I'm skilled worker still classify low income cost living here). know, feels like constantly living edge. bit stressful. Get aero wipers fam easier install Personally, see sides it. contribute inequities, think need push government fund districts equitably, hand parent really allowed spend money kids education others can’t? think there's also tipping point contact tracing fails nobody say sure whether anybody exposed. point need lock built areas even heavy restrictions still hard avoid coming contact people. Masks role play last line defence. Don’t forget wear mask two is. hurt.  

The rest world terrified coming sure hell want us going there. many Russian and/or Chinese hackers would allowed put money US. They're tightly watched. don’t disagree. Theaters problem professional sports starting have. theater setting great product good. house 75” screen, top line audio, fully stocked bar access practically complete oeuvre films available demand.

The theater decent bar, nice menu, maybe includes popcorn, limited selection movies times may may convenient me. It’s easy see model struggled - real estate costs theaters, I’d shocked doesn’t nearly kill completely. working slow reporting, least month. Recently, many reports tests Florida taking longer week. stop reporting positive test results, all, new cases.

Of course, people continue dying, that's detail. hospitals continue full, that's detail. people keep getting sick, that's detail.

Details, details -- many details. Many wealthy clients hired private teachers school year . , it’s close less regular tuition . also flying kids family privately . Thank you, appreciate :) hope too. think it’s part what’s frustrating... sometimes feels like partner care everyone getting sick do. 

I’m sending good thoughts loved ones too. Stay safe &lt;3  read article years back written employee one big Vegas gambling ‘arenas’ dirty Casino’s actually are. chips literally crawling bacteria human waste die hard gamblers sometimes incontinence pants don’t need take breaks tables.

Long live truth Yes. wrong could disaster like exactly denigrating apolitical scientific institutions like CDC tangible negative effect economy. Would people afraid send kids back school strong CDC guidance credibly implemented well-funded nation wide? hell lot fewer would be.  instead, basically asking parents hope underfunded school systems going keep kids safe federal government actively attacking scientific institutions encouraging local leadership put kids firing line without kind credible standards protect them.

I honestly believe numbers messed across country. Could less cases. friend submitted 3 tests. Never actually tested anyone.  sent in.  positive.  Go figure... Good know Stop paying mortgage.

LONDON — British drug company said Monday inhaled form commonly used medicine could slash odds Covid-19 patients becoming severely ill, sliver good news race find treatments met scientists equal measures caution cheer.
The drug, based interferon beta, protein naturally produced body orchestrate response viruses, become focus intensifying efforts Britain, China United States treat Covid-19 patients.
Scientists found coronavirus attacks body part blocking natural interferon response, disarming cells would otherwise alerting neighboring cells activate genes fortify invading virus. theory, administering interferon patients could invigorate defenses early stages illness.
But giving patients interferon without eliciting serious side effects proved challenging. symptoms seasonal flu, example, largely produced mobilization body’s interferon response, scientists said.

The British drug company, Synairgen, tried circumvent problem developing inhaled form interferon directly targets cells lungs, rather injection, produce intense side effects. conducted small, double-blind trial patients hospitalized Covid-19, illness caused coronavirus, nine British hospitals.
The initial results, announced brief news release but yet peer reviewed published, promising: inhaled form interferon beta tested Synairgen shown reduce odds hospitalized patients becoming severely ill — needing ventilation, example — 79 percent compared patients received placebo.

But significance findings seriously limited — and, view scientists, undercut — small size trial. involved 101 patients, Synairgen said, making difficult know certain beneficial drug affected patients differently. study could rule drug marginally effective.

“It’s exciting,” Professor Neil said. “By basically inhaling interferon site infection, looks like you’re taking edge virus.”

florida fucked. Alberta hasn’t (368 new cases Fri-Sun) better USA least? heard, vaccine provide permanent immunity covid-19. heard provides resistance year, it’s designed make things better permanent vaccine made. Better nothing, think means outbreaks social distancing still prioritized something. Millennials blame boomers world shit. think given millennials full hysteria mode coronavirus crisis, generation blame shit go Social distancing impossible classroom. could fit maybe 6 7 students class. Last year, class 30. America emphatically EASY immigrate to. don’t trust politicians corporations issue ever huh Thanks too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! favorite president!!this guy funny chain stores, yes. Otherwise, sadly really guys BOLD. Sorry, full. Try Mexico? \[\[ text source link support claim title \]\] Yeah fucked up. also knew better should’ve taken shit seriously. 140k deaths. Far I’m concerned trump anyone didn’t take shit seriously high government positions go fuck That’s cool, told something people already told me, rudely. Thanks. nice day Fox News viewers? 😐 fix hoax fox news viewers. Sinful! I'm glad cable TV watch brainwashing channel. Hopefully interpreted way voters. Hey, much conspiracy theory hospitals classifying everyone Covid get sweet, sweet $32,000 bonus.

Because would hospitals sending patients entire states actual case. Oh, no, fever chills?!?! That's point help argument, form. That's whole point though, done long time ago. cares excuses use today, I'm worried got started. Many Americans even passport begin with. USPS hamstrung funds right covid way is, I'm sure many issued fast enough people get way they're saying want to. going rude awakening many Americans start seriously researching takes emigrate. say immigrant many countries life, USA included. immigration maze total nightmare; I'd love see average American handle it.

They expect get phone call. Instead, get letter. partner sees letter. explain.

That change fact test, result. 10x many infections confirmed cases mean 9/10 asymptomatic, means people mild symptoms getting tested. definitely case back March/April, likely case hard hit states now.  can't let Florida 15 minutes fame. major stores forcing masks many states, trying join claim made call. mean 99+% do. death tragic sad vast majority young people completely fine. photo individual also BAME obese, latter especially huge risk factor. insane thing soon someone tests positive, matter weeks days, schools close again. risk lifelong health problems maybe death weeks school.

Parents actively suppress kids’ fevers medication. studies done suggest this? Yeah, bit joke Canadians. Oh look, Americans upset looking move ""nice America"". nothing ever comes it.  kind masks talking about? people going around using scarf bandana mask, instead standard surgical mask KN95 mask. Simply saying wear mask, without specifying **what** constitute adequate mask covid pretty pointless. believe it. Trauma basically trains brain prioritize surviving present future planning.

It could also international diplomacy. China lockeded real, meant SG could lock China without diplomatic backlash. early march, Trump still talking 'US cases flu', means locking American's could get Singapore Trump hitlist... sell MAGA Trump 2020 masks fanatics would walking billboards him.

Wow long post.
basically want model pathogen individual properly, specific condition , assuming conditions unknown going multiple ways testing :

you good grasp sufficient.
I going use AIDS, since used.

We going Need Several numbers :

K(T) absolute chance pathogen mean start disease.

For instance HIV 400 50 viral copies per calculate K(T) HIV blood transfusion (1 Liter) simply getting logarithm it

Because supposed K(T)^(amount copies) = transmission rate
the problem ... know number K(t) 
to start let's put kt = 1-K(T) TR = 1-transmission rate, equation :
Logkt(Transmission rate) = Logkt(kt^amount copies)

We rewrite as
Ln(TR)/Ln(kt) = Ln(kt^amount copies)/Ln(kt)
which equals Ln(TR)/Ln(kt) = Ln(kt)*amount Ln(TR)/Ln(kt) = amount copies = Ln(Kt)
With transmission rate 92.5% 0.925

We get 1-Kt = e^(ln(0.925)/copies)
in case 400*10^3 50*10^3
So (you may see exponential btw)

1-e^(ln(1-0.925)/400000)&lt; 1-Kt &lt;1-e^(ln(1-0.925)/50000)

Which tells us Kt comprised between
6.475646946557667e-06 5.1804001435340474e-05
Which absolutely ABYSMAL

for thoses wondering (and comfortable number)
these 2 numbers :
0.00065% 0.0052%

just checking get :
1-(1-0.0000065)^400000 = 0.92572704939
And
1-(1-0.0000065)^50000 = 0.92573144268

Let's 2 sequences.
the first one amount pathogen per transmission :
Let's note Pn
the second one K(T) corresponding transmission :
let's note Kn

So encounter individual Pn*Kn
That final sequence simply result
Tn = 1-(1-Kn)^Pn

Each transmission done different conditions (for instance sun, pathogene others)
So accounted separately exposure.

the number gets huge quickly

for instance let's assume person multiple sexual intercourses :
you have
Chances sick = 1-(1-T0)*(1-T1)*(1-T2)....(1-Tfinal-1)*(1-Tfinal)
Even 1% chances, chances stack quickly assuming multiple possibilities, curves changes
the chances exponential theory, practise hard estimate due people remembering day inability remember did.

The problem even 1% chance every occasions passing someone, 95% chance sick 300 occasions.

so get even simple model :
Number occasions = ln(1-(chances sick event seek))/ln(1-Tn)
So way explain simpler :
to 50% chances sick 0.1% encounter,
you would get ln(1-0.5)/ln(1-0.001) = 692.8 encounters.

it extremely easy understand much new encounter dangerous.
but reason use 1-Kt K(T) directly.
because pathogen either make sick huge amount ways 5 particle infect you,
It's Particle #1 3 infect , particle #2 ..... evryr particles.

all combination ways sick , one chance sick , NONE pathogens works, increasingly unlikely.

If throw sufficient amount rocks one end killing you, need 1 so.
what actually calculate therefore chances least 1 pathogen functional.

It works every thing, anything kill you, exposing much much reckless may believe.

If want way extend model population using growth rate, allows us throw lifestyle away concentrate impact things. gonna vaccine, things getting better right?! know else good preventing Covid? Masks what?! He's literally handing poor minimum wage worker cash could likely contaminated Covid. He's potentially spreading around total disregard fellow human beings. Fuck ethics, it’s money. It’s like teaching morons STD again....  put mask like put condom fuck street hooker... I’ve trouble swallowing, breathing mouth, felt lightheaded. get tested? know something, think right. always admit wrong. fraudulent. claim vaccine exhibited acceptable safety profile based findings, seems like logical conclusion. acknowledge vaccine caused higher rate side effects control vaccine none serious enough OTC pain meds help. first step. surprised already working follow group participants.  mean, wrong... Sure thing snippet important stuff -

""Our best estimate right every case that's reported, actually 10 infections,"" Dr. Robert Redfield, director CDC  I'm Pocatello ""I'm sheep"" sheep refusing wear masks rest ignore it, like said. looking forward coming weeks. end spectrum seeing significant increase severity people get virus intimate partner? imagine viral load intimacy someone infected would massive sure will, stupidly simple statistics problem anyone stats minor. basically figuring many test's batch maximize number people test. ie batch 3 tests 1 3 batches statistically require retest individual samples 9 people use 6 tests. 1 4, 12 people require 8 tests. positive rates low single digits test way people tests saved number scales exponentially  Berlin armpit germany 😁 want start comment saying trust professional healthcare experts whatever recommend. uncertainty months ago? feel like healthcare experts back sort wishy washy effectiveness masks hold crust. mentioned too! Ugh!

It explains young, healthy healthcare professionals drop dead. They’re patients coughing them. hand, obese people 50s asymptotic, thanks constantly wearing mask. That's logic half people know days.

""Oh I've quarantined since March! Well except neighbors 4th July BBQ, mom's birthday party, flight took see girlfriend, going local pool three times week..."" 😑 Seriously heartbreaking, whole life ahead him. family must devastated—praying them. Yeah actually raising child hard, FOUR even so. Thank encouraging google ""kittens wearing masks."" disappoint. suggest it.   information one schools ~1300 students. sure schools district teachers/staff quit.  
I glad decided put health first - shitty position put in. thought HIV vaccine, like mostly immune something. Well wonder people believe rely ""common sense"" rather data. China also let sick people hang home infect family identified primary transmission vector. company run stupidest people ever met. I’ll never understand mask debate still ongoing. wear masks outbreak area. It’s hard wrap mind around like god people. likely. local dominoes ALWAYS hiring least going decent food sadly stupid keto diet rough one. slovakia, would consider apply ""eastern europe"" - meaning slovenia, slovakia, czechia, poland, baltics. here, way easier move west. Many people say ethical paying tests. Well many citizens would pay timely tests well, everyone else still pays tests form taxes. 

This unethical lives prioritized unnecessary. healthcare service workers cannot get timely test fuck NBA. average American worker contributes much economy more. *[Alex Jones entered chat]*  Next going tell Yukon potatoes grown Yukon PEI potatoes grown PEI! 

(Pardon go google ""russet"" place) Keep lying, maybe daddy trump retweet :( people truly selfish horrific. I’m sorry it’s getting down. You’re one. Hang there. Daily reported cases US suddenly dropped 10,000 18 July. changed? drop make sense terms virus disappearing, sudden big that.

Edit: weekend reporting seems likely, thanks.  Show us diagram facts touched you... Please quit. helping kids dead/on disability. Pandemic temporary, health forever. Remember protests nobody gets infected churches everybody gets infected, weird virus infects politically correct ways  Yes, yes. Thank you. that's warrior Good. here. I've advocate masks since 2003 SARS happened.

Don't know onboard this: Masks protect others, protect wearers well. average value. says one infected person average infects much people. virus care numbers, cares hosts. We’ve already fucking done before. Schools closed 1918. Many countries even closed schools 1957 pandemic.

This part standard response pandemic. yet seen evidence virus mutated way would evade body's natural defenses developed previous infection. literally impossible, reason believe it. swear... jut want go around slapping people hoping knock sense them. know everyone became anti-science ridiculous. know one relatives benefited lot science/medicine terms personal health, they're adamantly anti-mask ""believe in"" COVID. can't understand it. abandoning whole ""city folk retreating nature"" narrative already? ""speculation"" (i.e. random bullshit) RVs ""seen""?

Rural dwellers eat, work even get healthcare without city dwellers admission. Seems odd call ""problem"" Pretty low bar..... fucked covid management, compare USA pat back DIFFIDENTLY hit worse currently state. wish would fix mess created help ones tried containing it. wish best stay safe mate. I'm willing upgrade ""no proof happening"" ""probably worth scientific study get around it, may may happening, happening often enough relevant epidemiological policies."" 


People \*want\* mean ""immunity exist we're dooooooomed"" really means ""immunity binary, resistance reinfection overcome rare circumstances.""  makes feel bit better. mom came contact someone might COVID work today. Apparently HR/the higher ups known since last week tell workers. mom heard rumors someone might COVID know interacted (touched hand (he wearing fingerless gloves) gave keys, unlocked supply closet him, etc.). wearing mask, clean hands keys after, I've verge breakdown/panic attack day. Sweet kitten masks - want see those.

I always want see kittens...

Where Sweet kitten masks pictures? demand NOW! /r/nocontext constantly get ad stuck head. 

O'rielly's marketing dept, win.

WOAW shield, gloves

Don’t forget bring lance sword run COVID flees.!  🦠🦯🏇 🗡 Possibly worst leaders we've ever facing greatest immediate existential threat. reports peoples oxygen drops without noticing. understand Rt means? 

The fact equal greater 1.0 answers confusion originally expressed.  Mostly false = literally true, now? America. realize already explained another thread, fact repeating bullshit makes clear really looking answer instead looking spread bullshit around. case anyone else reading understand: people work weekends. Deaths reported Monday people whose deaths reported state Sunday. often times, deaths get reported state weekend show state totals Tuesday.

This look daily deaths see clear drop Sundays Mondays jump back Tuesdays. also everyone looks 7 day trends. 7 day trend deaths continues trend upwards. PPP program designed protect income individual employees. Church employees pay income taxes, withdrawn paychecks like us. they're paying taxes program benefit? mask thing another excuse emotionally fragile explode. 

Every controversy brings, generality, angry, physically aggressive men angry, emotionally abusive women woodwork. 

It happens always type people. I’m US iOS tells exposure notifications available region. not? pretending issue people making shit nobody really knows anything. actual issue people making shit others actually *do* know stuff. reason consistency owners want know they're sacrificing loved ones power, like want know last year year that, reason never consistency mainstream media US. People actually read studies analyze methodologies use critical thinking still know stuff, look like ass pretending feel better believing propaganda. got laughed today Boise wearing mask. So, you’re basically saying masks isn’t god?

There’s need wear masks! /s

P.S. hate put /s outlandishly stupid comment... So... September timeline postponed actually beginning mass rollout? “Something something tyrants, something something second amendment.”

What’s that? I’m getting word people tyrants second amendment agree goblin? Ah, well, nevertheless. Kids look teachers. happens, whole next generation learn bend big brother. I’m guy, pal You’re welcome. say mainstream news *__late__* January. global pandemic, inside infected minipandemics spreading within infected, infecting cells person.  y’all next.

I've saying weeks. days ago ([according doctors KU apparently #1 new cases per capita. looked yesterday, new reported cases board. 46 one day. 1,065 two days later. overall trend up, virtually impossible clear exactly what's happening current national leadership.

I'm predicting going slowly crawl FL, TX, Arizona wash rest country like tsunami.

Unless act advice offered qualified offer it, watch countries learn them. wrong, effective convincing anyone? I'd argue statements like actually polarize people away desired outcome want. Well government interests mind wouldn’t problem. Instead forced march death contemplate tax cut rich next relief bill. makes sense. respiratory disease cardiovascular involvement occur - cases. point article saying people get infected, become immune infection antibodies t-cells. antibodies decline, t-cells likely remain meaning subsequent infections cause mild illness. people saying article experts reputable - they're downplaying anything. Fuck government. Literally nobody wearing masks, n95 n99 supposed protect you, crowd idiots care covid all. give shit themselves, I? I'm sure mad landlord, supplies property agreed price per month.  post goes cdc says mask i.e. mask protecting wearer covid stop wearer expelling droplets spreading virus I'm Deep South state republican governor nightmare. Every bit real see portrayed media. amount people businesses wearing mask absolutely staggering. There's zero plan anywhere ones exist boneheaded max.

It's funny mention NH, wife trying move Maine. Portland area. Governor doesn’t authority issue restrictions there. why. 

Their lockdown ruled unconstitutional well immediately lifted. exist drug companies could don’t know lower prices.

Drug companies would never lower prices people still pay higher amount. Many people using GoodRx don’t insurance &amp; wouldn’t otherwise using medicine all. GoodRx doesn’t massively affect drug companies bottom line, usually accepted big chain pharmacies, insurance-contracted mail order places many insurances requiring many members use. 

Older people use largest proportion meds also less likely check use App GoodRx site every med (GoodRx makes money via ads, referral fees, subscription service selling technology). 

The physical card might give doctor’s office often date (which frustrates potential customers, esp non-tech saavy) bc BIN/code numbers constantly updated site reflect current prices it’s different code pharmacy listed. Wearing mask school whole day school different wearing mask grocery store half hour. wear mask almost 5 hours work, felt hard breathe while.   fetus lives. Interesting, appreciate story. 

Hoping things stay well children wife feels better soon(: Wow, wish kind pocket money parents. anything parenting. saying this? long boomers exist, Facebook exist unfortunately trend still pretty bad. Looking desperately one day look good kind pointless. look weeks really idea whats happening. complicated. testing keeping up, positive tests getting pushed out, etc. parent mountain debt?

I know /r/personalfinance given great advice paying parents debt navigate it, everyone dies full bank account savings. goes oval office first western world seriously needs kindergarten classes. seems lot adults failed normally learn kindergarten. Except adopted daughter  still sign It’s written constitution since 60’s 70’s, think would take new Governor. It’s possible enough backing support, doubtful what’s currently going saw video days ago, wish could find now, talked thing. paramedic NHS (I think) using Google live translate phone give hard hearing patients visual speech. Perhaps could modify holding cell phone Google live translate activated. Thereby, letting masked talker speak, read words screen. Might perfect, may less frustrating going now. 
I hope I'm explaining correctly. find video again, I'll link here.  Thats almost 7 mil people. sure going missed bodies never get tested.

How young India though also helps greatly Definitely not. spent far long trying figure name reality show won. dont believe app necessary people upvote trash idiots

Look blame app NSA spying everything every American online.

Contact tracing apps usefulThis app trash.The people upvote idiots (or least idiots so).

If actually want positively affect data privacy security US divorce position opposition reasonable measures. grassroot support help change Washington's stance, talking contact tracing purview idiots akin weed killer. 


Edit: downvote answer say want hear. really favours. people interviewed experts though reputable. agree. shows ridiculous people gotten it, logic goes window moment questions vaccine way. Thank you. wondering anything theme park workers Florida especially Universal Disney. look cool alternative could becoming homeless without food. would choose? Almost every store I've mom-and-pop brought armed security beginning masks first required, Texas spend time California.  ones interacting mouthbreathers doors. governor replaced, could overturned? Basically similar touched Flood Infection Form tentacles Halo, real microscopic. may talk asymptomatic spread, certainly mainstream proven.

It thing popped head US health authorities said February sick people wear masks, like, “If asymtomatic transmission possible, hell know who’s sick said reason change day day, unless see community spread.

CDC already Confirmed Possible Instance Community Spread COVID-19 [Feb yet nothing much done.

By way, interview never taken context. Yes, say masks reserved medical personnel sick due shortage, also lied implied masks effective “healthy” people.

EDIT:

You can’t rely factcheck.org, everything say true. think age factor greatly benefits India  teachers. ounce prevention worth pound cure. won’t many kids, we’d foolish think won’t least some. Even 1/5000 kids gets gets hospitalized dies, multiple kids school districts fall severely ill. 

I think narrative psychological perspective wrong. Anyone remember grade school learning fellow student passed away? 

That brought lot trauma shock schools. 

The wild “we got this” approach belief won’t blow face insane. It’s beneficial induce anxiety stress fear children they’re placed environment that’s conducive spreading sickness germs. 

The lack stability consistency comes flip flop hybrid approach, full school, ability learn remote means wishy washy back forth tactic hope stays stable (it’s Covid, know doesn’t work way). 

What happens sons school teacher catches Covid? feel awful teacher, ones even thinking trauma anxiety would bring school aged children. 

The lack proper infrastructure sound logistics causes many schools struggle spreading germs common cold. really believe narrative kids don’t catch Covid going work? 

We spent 4 months thumb butts hoping praying Covid would go away, dying summer, pretty ignorant belief school time things would “manageable”. 

Instead innovative adapting online learning, forced narrative kids MUST school used last spring example didn’t work. 

Well again, online learning plan, numbers far worse March, instead adapting finding way integrate online learning feasible interactive way, we’ve done practically nothing. 

Lastly, think it’s unwise say generation children don’t benefit learning online. 5 year olds work iPhone faster 60 year olds making decisions saying “online learning doesn’t work”. son look video YouTube learn something quicker people sit physically teach. 

Do think person learning multiple reasons beneficial e learning? Definitely. manageable change year order keep people safe? Definitely. live country/state 32° average glasses still fog put mask. keep glasses pockets I'm using mask. Eh, seems might heading second wave allowing Catalunya lock again?  Interesting, thanks clarification.  contrary, financial incentives patented technologies. Saw acknowledgements section Chad vaccine research article. Prior evidence, experts already saying adults could get it, young adults could get spread it. pretty good evidence accurate. young spreader. Unfortunately, people seem think ""kids can't get spread it"" includes teenagers... doesn't. Also, quote generally wrong anyway. wife right (going day 16 fever) idea I'm sick getting it. live smaller house two kids one sick. tested negative around week. Awaiting results second test idea I'm getting it. No, irrelevant data using correct verified third parties. conjecture actual experts looked credible source (DOH, CDC, etc.), also used, concluded numbers correct ones dashboard using misrepresenting data. 

And need insult people can't accept wrong, fuck off.  dont think fair teachers. But, ever better time combined effort teachers nationwide get us properly educated aware danger?

We sending children who's parents dont even believe virus real school rest kids soon. 

I'm sure teachers know hard deal misinformation parents home. Schools worst comes spreading diseases. remember kid school myself, got sick damn time school. Soon graduated, moved life? rarely get sick anymore. California mask mandate month recorded record 12,000 cases yesterday. good thing saying happened late good preventing negative consequences. Dan Patrick Greg Abbott, Texans never stood chance. med center ERs packed. Dumb dumber aka idiot fuck tard held million dollar frac due failing choke valve.
They wanted finish frac. ""Replace unit request denied.""
They looked supervisor agreed.

They hot shot another choke valve frac-T 1am got rolling again.
Pretty sure truckers grow pair make call lives families lives. Thanks. must missed then. one 2 studies back late Jan say widely acknowledged Jan late Jan time first known case outside China. trials read ranged 21 days 28 days. wipe ass train people think, whatever want body technology fix it. even less healthy behaviours No. protest. can’t strike. There’s difference Serious question?

What kind immunity governor have? follow instructions child dies left permanent condition, sued personally along suing government Missouri?  mean... 3,000 people died due airplanes crashing buildings.. cases like idiots major underlying health issues went vacationed Orlando anyways died 

I'm sorry 3,000 innocent lives billion times sad.

Stay fuck inside, wear mask, wash hands. Good bye. missed! Nothing historical, proposition common debt. Others countries agree. Here's Georgia's latest case/death quite case spike, story surprise. Deaths still lagging. imagine work like yellow fever countries, need proof vaccination border requirement enter country viruses mutate rate flu, one biggest culprits requiring different vaccines. Months ago thought read vaccines targeting spike proteins outside coronavirus, highly conserved (ie mutated) throughout pandemic. say mutate, far shown concern.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Replace Olympics people who've quarantine year. Wait think could attributed strict lockdown? would us learn scenario? taken far long information start coming out. news morning said they've banned eating drinking walking. 
And still can't understand....people entering sit-down restaurants enclosed spaces recirculated air conditioning Disney World taking masks eating drinking laughing without masks seated indoors numerous people around. insanity. 
No one telling close indoor restaurants parks. 
Man, would love see cell-phone data left parks eating restaurants took virus them.  
You're allowed remove mask! policy! Inside recirculated air. Madness. Currently train Bristol Cardiff, everyone mask on.  **yourself** Florida beautiful state, come visit! It’s little hot it’s still wonderful. know anything viruses medicine general? did, know viruses always carried particles, case snot, spit phlegm (respiratory particles) indeed stopped masks.

Of course know that, post full confidence person even know little know. make click link? even restaurant's policy, state mandate now. country serious entitlement issue. didnt even think libraries closed! Good point! ... let erase initial post.....lol dumb thing this, non valved masks spread unfiltered air also. Instead air leaving valve leaves nose sides. least valve directs airflow ground. Anyone gets fogging glasses wearing mask seeing unfiltered droplets leaving around nose area. 

I valved n95s covered valve assembly filter material. someone else mentioned, could also cover entire mask surgical mask. put people’s mind ease around me, avoid conversation. Word warning though, 3M says shouldn’t block valve don’t go lot details why.

Here study measured amount particles leaving 3 different mask types. 3M 1872V valved mask amount particles leaving mask surgical mask cloth mask, more. masks though people need conscious false sense security provide. see many people wearing gloves constantly touching faces. good tool wearing set gloves hour, never washing hands still touching face actually worse gloves washing. ""Most studies underpowered limited sample size, studies also reported suboptimal adherence face mask group."" literally says article Realizing people's true nature really sucks think best longterm.

My friend invited go hiking July 4th agreed long kept distance wore mask majority hike. hike, tells got back trip MS, TN, AZ (we CA). Uhhhh what? days later, tells tests positive. go get tested, luckily I'm negative spent like week worrying. talk waiting results angry. Finally got results told feeling, upset didnt tell traveling beforehand felt like choice accepting elevated risk. tells ""sorry feel way"" (not apology) defends actions. said still goes work, there's risk grocery store, getting take out, etc., can't avoid altogether can't live ""life bubble"". accept responsibility whatsoever understand (or care?) actions risky especially nursing school (wtf!!!!). even think would felt bad got ""could got anywhere"" (🙄).

She done questionable shit past last straw. really want friends someone selfish anymore.   Wrong country, violent guns. I'm pretty sure I'm scared I'm giving so. hope ends like you. 

So far symptoms seem bad good suppose immune system great. Hoping we.both recover without much trouble. 

The headaches killer. know sure yet I'm getting tested today. I'm praying qualify state disability almost sick time. think Jeff Bezos could take care own... would watch that. would like Total Wipeout serious. Russian, I'd like hope government learnt something Chernobyl. libraries facilities offer free internet access volunteer tax assistance closed coronavirus pandemic. Filing paper application wasn’t possible IRS offices also closed pandemic faced large backlog began reopening phases. Unfortunately, people put political party short term gratification children's lives every day, they'll angrily tell right, too. That’s democracy works. Majority rules majority chose backed DeSantis. That’s it. Democrats perhaps run centrist platform defeat republicans. least they’ve nominated joe Biden. work one big box pet store. confirm, clients shoppers ridiculous.

I asked one lady please put mask shopping, called a, ""f*&amp;#ing liberal."" fun. saw real account, instead throwaway. would probably see think Facebook *great source facts*.

As suspect beleive ""true"", likely learned memes. Mousewitz Duckau.

These actual terms used park personnel. Drive parkway, park driveway. Thank you, sent way well. Stay safe. keeping park open ok vitamin D.... sun exposure.its bit odd statement apparently high sun locations mean individual actually produced vitamin d. Shes also wealthy family no, linear would be, instance, adding 2 again. end result actual line, hence linear. Doubling time exponential, end result would steep curve upward. Someone jealous. Harry you?  link Fauci said late Jan good one. would love meetings throughout Feb see rationalization came pass. guess, combination hubris US somehow controlled spread internally, knowing US enough also lied implied masks effective “healthy” people.

Just note CDC still says primary use mask protect others yourself. claim "" everyone either making political statement wearing masks pretending like pandemic."" That's wrong.  Like said, mask requirement Boise usage grocery stores close 100%.  see masks everywhere. I'm sure every single person, claim that. actually live work downtown.  Boise largely complying mask requirement, result, Ada County actually dipped much-less populous Canyon County infection family work variety businesses They’re threatened wearing masks work, specifically family work vacation/resort industry.

Why even currently working ""vacation/resort industry"" right now?  sure they're Sun Valley?

I wish we'd cut back political rallies. Another big one tonight. Americans decided mass gatherings safe wear mask.  We're country thinks that.  nobody wants say protests unsafe. virus care sea humanity. American let’s see remember 

Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatoon? Alberta, British Columbia. 

I also work groups every province Ontario, British Columbia Alberta popular locations. Wrong, waiting lists applicants. I've fortunate I've able work remote foe majority time. we've wished virus away I've start going office more. Since confirmed case office I've chosen see family mitigate risk spreading them. 

Good vibes coming way stranger. Selling passports shameful practice. see countries can't refuse entry, works rich. Could Michael Brooks (37 male) sudden random death rumored pulmonary embolism side effect Covid-19? [I've addressed attempting define treat virus something caught cyclically.

Why ignore reality? Look pandemic similar scale: 1918, 2009, go away, virus becomes endemic. Thousands kids *not* going die. It’s extreme totally outlandish statements drive people away. Stick facts son. ??

I serve people food. They’d furious wasn’t wearing gloves lol Agreed  Crazy start talking things like getting mass downvoted isiots linking articles since (and even time) proven widely false masks ""dont protect could even harm non-infected wearer"". OMG noticed downstairs neighbor installed one window! figured A/C broken...I wonder Covid, rather protect others living unit? probably he's elderly man living two young couples across anti-masker. sell one Putin’s palaces, money problem. opponent got little extreme easy paint socialist. Plus, short time later opponent found Miami Beach hotel room, Nude unconscious floor drug orgy gay stripper...he (was?) married kids btw.. like sole reason cannot handle truth Yellow Cards could used although seem easy falsify. one Yellow Fever vaccinations listed there. zero protections forgery. Duck trump, rebmeber moron said hoax to. Make look bad entire fanvase believes still spouts nonsense said ""slow testing down"" got bag, damn Yet, one first stores social distancing markers floor plexiglass checkout. agree people refusing wear masks government issues orders expects people follow never comes answer to, ""what people follow them."" one billion people care and, oh, internacional division labor created last decades made world economy dependent China, specially third world countries like Brazil. name kids shit like Reality Winner. Tell families surviving dead wow... lot businesses, money lives. Whatever, Cold War already beginning would venture guess trade embargo similar world South Africa near future. Remember comment.

At end day human rights violation human rights violation. didn’t vote Bush don’t think anyone expected 9/11 happen. America demanded answers thats joined proxy war. republican president, that’s would happen something happened now, get it, it’s fucked core it’s Russia vs America thing extends back Mujahideen. end day human rights human rights. don’t believe Chinese bad would hope one would think Americans aren’t bad. 

Human rights human rights. taken anyone else, messed with. point needs worldwide organization create human living standard. Fuck dark governments.

I wouldn’t visited Middle East back 2000’s, wouldn’t visited Russia Vietnam 70’s, wouldn’t ever visited Cuba, visit China now; say bad places people bad, it’s highly political tense climate don’t see anyone would want to. German leaders calling China recent weeks. China aggressive India reclaiming territory hasn’t disputed since 60’s. someone anything say, I’m open hearing it. 

Just stop acting like it’s USA vs China, it’s world vs China. fuck wants go America 😂 What’s 75%?  took people changing narrative make face masks patriotic make finally 180°? Let's take notes everyone, 140,000+ dead, word ""patriotic"". fucking disgrace. wearing mask means living fear you, cut world.  It’s like small towns way think basically buying time. Let’s say takes 6 hours virus double 72 hours meaningful adaptive immune response occur. would mean virus doubles 12 times 72 hours 4096-fold. Let’s say situation one would need 50,000 viral copies show symptoms. initial exposure 100 viruses, you’d meaningful response 409600 copies would show symptoms. exposed 10 virus particles, you’d get 40960 threshold showing symptoms. variables situation unfortunately dependent individual. Older people may take 96 hours. That’s enough actually make initial dose 10 peak 655,360. Older people worse cardiac output disrupting oxygenation vasculature going cause end organ failure lower doses. Maybe show symptoms 30,000. people might particularly good niche viral growth making doubling time 4 hours. can’t control variables it’s largely based long term health underlying genetics. control initial dose wearing appropriate PPE including masks public. also able manipulate adaptive immune response time using vaccine. also explains vaccine don’t prevent spread make cases less severe infected. Pretty much experts saying least year though. following subreddit anyway, decided check first time months. I'm paying close attention covid related news lockdown pretty comfortable me. Like teen stepson, even doesn’t wash hands poops. expect? Well clearly didn't, EU handled pandemic pretty well considering population densities helping support members struggling cope lack tourism trade. could desperate money afford lock provide cash poorer parts community aren't. US situation, still reached peak government screwing people even talking ignoring election results. way it’s mid-2021 best case scenario. question still stands. don’t think I’m rushing get dosage. think explanation, bc number new virions single cycle great. difference low viral load high viral load probably cycle two. lot time.

I think needing higher viral load infect lower respiratory tract. differences infection mucosal tissue vs alveolar tissue. mistresses. accepted science covid19 yet, no. I'm drunk af, read full ""article"" (I tried, know drunktard get far).

It's blame game.

Take example. I'm now, living Corona-free country lurk sub something read, think life (and life) +1 number, already big already. me, random guy die (idc), vice versa. Everyone like that.

Unless directly affect life, witness. know reason. time wore mask everything country done (I'm lucky af gonna lie), reading damage side. wore bc already felt like outstander anyway ):

Have every questioned US country much resistance. know exceptionalism, one instead selective group like day night ...

You live life. live life. care others. care future. US banned world reason. Ahh yes, Gofundme. America's leading healthcare provider. like communism want ubi move country offers it. Yeah that's terrible, least come close bombing fuck middle East killing millions Muslims last 20 years. yeah care people Xinjiang. Perhaps stick lane, simpleton Ohio stop trying big boy analysis. emphasised study cannot read interpreted RCT. Prognostic similarity baseline cannot assumed, spite several efforts match control patients closely possible treated patients. Residual confounding unmeasured variables likely. patients almost perfectly matched age gender efforts made assure control patients sampled evidence CSS, certain baseline differences remained, although directions. Diabetes obesity slightly prevalent control patients biomarkers CSS slightly higher too. Cardiovascular comorbidity arrhythmias, hand, prevalent treated patients. rigorous confounding analysis revealed none potential confounders reducing influence magnitude treatment effect, importantly adds credibility univariable results. Instead, HRs seemed increase rather decrease adjusting confounders, observation may point statistical overfitting therefore limited relevance.

*""It early days, initial amount virus person infected doesn’t correlate severity disease symptoms, would mark covid-19 different influenza, MERS SARS.""*    
And really it. take true MERS, SARS, influenza use defaults true Covid-19. Instead, saw kind of, virus innocent proven guilty.  Also, back March, George Gao Fu CDC(China) said big mistake U.S. Europe one wearing masks.    

The advice there, back needed. But, get guys. rely them, including Fauci. overseas people reliable. people, any, suggesting lockdowns February. Plenty people saying go out, Texas. Plenty headlines media downplaying virus. Plenty idiocy go around, easy play Monday morning quarterback. many teachers support staff high risk? many kids risk parent, sibling, grandparent? many kids get babysat grandparent aunt uncle several days week school. many kids preexisting conditions diagnosed? often hear high school college athlete dropped dead suddenly heart condition one knew had? many children die much younger age similar unknown conditions?  Everyone keeps talking 2020's hindsight, foresight know what's coming ride awful.

I'm Florida, btw. Looking forward seeing hurricane season turns out. Victims pulled bootstraps little harder. /s cares? UK ordered vaccines different institutions (such Pfizer Imperial College) countries would range vaccines rely on. Different vaccines work better different people, Oxford vaccine isn’t effective booster shots. matter white, problem merch go back hole, one cares here. problem. get theres gonna pecking order kind thing.... Clearly false positives I’ve heard good authority school aged kids get spread virus. /s compete Survivor watch Handmaid's Tale. Trust say could get lot worse OPs comments lol. Texas. 29 million. 4,100 deaths.

That makes *140 deaths per million*.

As comparison ..

Texas (29m) - 140

Canada (35m) - 235

Ireland (5m) - 355

The USA overall - 435

UK (63m) - 667 It’s like magical “end discussion!” think let immediately get way without argument.

It magical weapon. does, however, pressure integrity side, explain actions legal. good thing? 

Want people wear masks? Pass law voted representatives, voted us people. majority wins, implement mandatory helmet wearing want. Good luck Absolutly. Take care, friend. I'd happily one hats. mean, I'd argue despite ignorance, 150,000 people fifty times sadder 3000.

I mean, think linear, 3000 national disaster, started wars (plural) invaded countries. One Hundred Fifty Thousand fake news though. That's lot crisis actors pay. Facebook, Amazon, Tinder, Snapchat. list apps already tracking goes on. 

The time concerned possibility tracked decade ago, time passed. 

I like that's that.

Also app literally funded government, astroturfing. 
While Irish government problems actively openly dismanteling democracy speak. Unlike Republicans. Bone crushing austerity. Hi, defending thesis next week. help you? know comment right now, make observations arguments may even muse make light this......but two months going world hurt......2 months. Actually less that. 

This scares me. FLU comes..... Eh.

People lives Texas also happens want live wearing helmets FACEMASKS! considering many scenarios hundred year old poem could apply to, probably few.

edit:building better schools versus building prisons common example wow! really friendly. SOrry, I'm sympathetic, dont leave house either. age Amazon, grocery delivery curbside pickup, either make wear mask dont take you. want get sick? seems like care kid do. Best healthcare world. afford white genocide 😷😭 fair world, would case. sadly laws universe always work way wish would. citation? still registers signature. don’t think fly all. can't buy cabbages foodstuffs Macys tho unless snacks Starbuck inside, people understandably wanna see pride starbuck cups right now. way Gallup measuring U.S. adults' use face masks since early April found nearly nine 10 say used one in past week.

My original claim people wear masks that's absolutely supported link.

Adding levels distinctions - like often wear mask properly - covered claim.

You insight entailed 44%. people public park, one around miles, picnic folks might wear mask instance despite saying consistently wear masks.

My claim right. want refute claim, need far data. thank Lets honest, cause realized could sell MAGA masks GOP members pushing anti-mask / anti-science eventually find everyone actually knows person, first name, died this.

We're already seeing people say, ""My dad's coworker's grand mother died heart attack THEY'RE LISTING COVID DEATH!""

People believe want despite facts. bet little digging they'll find highly correlated likelihood bank account. lot easier lose check direct deposit. course, makes better headlines somehow imply racism. AstraZeneca expects vaccine immunity last [one  Every life sacred...until born, another cog great economic machine. FTFY. look websites. Gap may using *Loss Prevention Agent* protecting assets company, including employees prevention, awareness, communication deterrence. Responsible making safe apprehensions following apprehension said, idea plan use role enforce masks work there. air goes AC filter going less contaminated air goes cloth mask. get people's logic comes 'recirculated air'. Maybe take Immunology class listen actual virologists infectious disease doctors telling is. also maybe stop condescending prick speaking field expertise in.   jaw dropped first time someone (in real life) made argument people ""going die anyways."" wanted bring 20, 30, 40 year olds stood there. even respond something like that? slow address obvious things like this? he, though? much people change Amazon shopping habits?

In normal democracy political hacks would dragged office much harm public health overall health country. unless read paper

An unreasonable expectation, sure. I’m vegetarian I’ll happily consume money note CDC still says primary use mask protect others yourself.

Despite mounting evidence date masks also protect wearers, CDC still maintain stance. disappointing. I’m surprised. even worse! land chads suck it. Greedy piles steaming dung. Rent forgiveness now! You.... like you. leaving United States.  began wearing mask one month government began recommending it. Wuhan CDC produced online literature advising people wear masks. time, information started coming regarding asymptomatic spread. Since government recommended wearing one sick caring someone sick, ability know whether asymptomatic carrier, wore mask. Simple logical response.

I repeatedly mocked people community fake coughed one instance, laughed at. grocery shopping, nobody distanced continue now. People stared like sort freak actively participated panic buying everything, including myopic toilet paper buying sprees. 

I person rubbing backs mine trying pass packing groceries opposite conveyor belt. kept saying ""excuse me"" over, politely told keep distance wait over. Eventually snapped verbally let full view public. told busy body woman across one needed calm down.

I'm leaving house anything crucial reasons avoid two things: virus, members community. I've lost faith them. threat passes, new normal continue isolation. Recirculated air good thing unless there's filter system all. Remember airborne, clinging particles hang air circulation. People outside get less air moves there.

The filters dry catch moisture going (like mask), essentially cleaning air it. yes. Yes am. Well one requires tensile strength restrain 11,120 N.

The needs stop tiny droplets mouth.

Stop acting like comparable. One MUCH easier achieve other. I'll let figure which. That’s what’s happening. alternatives parent work. 

-More employers let work home can, obviously employers can/will that
-Utilizing friends family community small groups kids together (2-3) elementary age groups maybe middle school really can’t stay home alone. high school age students able stay home responsible log (I understand limitations here, need take responsibility education know better little kids) justification actions below? seem actions stellar luminary, ""best best"", ""epitome"" everything good brilliant righteous. 

But maybe something missing, maybe lecturing public wearing masks protect airborne, pulminary contagion, instructing wear them, epitome do. Maybe epitome condone mass protests looting one group, condemning arguing state force another group, basis political affiliation alone. Maybe best best, greatest medical professional ever grace Earth, good reason country completely unprepared this, despite charge 40 years. People stupid. going read decide go stay away home much possible Fox News “politicizing” masks? sure everyone, gets summer Texas gulf coast, lot people stay inside. 95+ degree weather  11 6 PM plus super high humidity 10 PM 10 leave lot time outside pleasant. get store like Wal Mart stay open Kohls Burlington Coat, etc. boat load people go wal mart every day. Tons employees customers. one even goes store like Kohls. places kind empty even Virus. would feel lot safer Macys WalMart. Makes sense....But many heed it?  Jackson County one coastal counties MS. Maybe one day every article clearly state location state beginning force readers rely using context, clicking links, downloading pdfs verify location. Local news gets thrown national stage time day age, let's clear confusion.

Sorry rant, one mention MS actual article. closest get Governor's name. video article MS name nothing article. assume MS articles sidebar know say making assumptions. Seriously, simple (Jackson County, MS) beginning would clear up. also blame OP even something worry first place. Yes really. History care excuses. History records successes failures. 

Jerome Adams is, always even past end life, historical failure. level failure epic, especially compared great surgeons generals past.

He's lightweight, failed. That's it. Maybe waits till elections says 'some mistakes made, learnt apologize must move forward.' supporters go mad saying look honest is, made mistake big enough man say country loses shit Boeing him. Yes point mask *blunts* amount virus take around others shedding it. take in, harder body fight, especially long periods time around people continually shedding letting others breathe days adding viral load. Blunting effect could one variable difference life death.

Edit: ICU Covid nurse Houston. early March wearing mask work, healthcare clinic. told boss stop since virus airborne, scaring people spreading false information.

I longer work him, remember telling day. SARS virus know airborne per company pnp. isolated passengers sharing recirculating air still contract virus. talked saying know doctors saying droplet.

No, know them. lying. told change policy bc airborne, step down. I'm location anymore really care.

The point actually much damage done early on. beginning mask PSA mistake. So, maybe start wearing mask? money loss thing listen to. Personally, hope Zuckerberg gets completely screwed Facebook dies off, people reliant completely stop using (even ""to keep touch family""). 

As long AD providers conscious Facebook right thing. It’s sad also see people says they’ve known several people “China virus” recovered. yeah, nah ice roads could lead covid deaths

I've seen folks Texas react snow roads. Everything hurts folks more...  Heh. best represent their... flavor. stepdad taught while. gone barber years, even pandemic. wife gotten good giving cheap ass haircut. I'd recommend wearing 2 they're quite thin Smart move. Microsoft. mean Microsoft. Pocatello, well. many wearing masks, even medical staff hospital taking seriously, taking masks elevators, wearing nose. Even son's boy scout troop still went Bear Lake Jamboree even though would let son go. get test without symptoms traveled even though evidence community transmission here, oh ordered doctor well, pay $200 see doc, ask test pay test (not sure much are). barely enough money rising rent food costs, enough go doctor without MAJOR symptoms. least 12 cases day Bannock County last two weeks.  K looking Eurostat government deficit/Surplus rn. Italy surplus since least 2008. said anything United States? want significant P-value though shut bunch people studies inconclusive.

One grad students program (fucking immunology things) keeps saying hang play music together that, supports masks, want wear hang uncomfortable ""doesn't even help much"".

I need goddamn p-value educated ass. matter way explaining would make seem like wearing mask would bad user, would exhaling repeatedly inhaling essentially giving repeated megadose initial exposure.

Masks absorb droplets, keep suspended face mask. top scientist country ought able think himself? 

Because Americans expect better surgeon general lame little excuse-maker? leader do, take pressure right thing.

Now critics responsible appear prc china? point it’s delusion grandeur agreement disagree. 

Have good day. told Russians “penetrated” voting machines “look around.” Really? Russians spent millions dollars trying change outcome US election Trump’s favor? Gee, awfully nice tamper voting machines. really bad news LinkedIn proxy well paying jobs filled. Meh.... panic attacks far week. got text job possibility today maybe pan I’m holding breath. Thank asking really enforce first order. hope different time, mixed bag people caring here. Cleaning hands saving lungs.

You seem knowledgeable Scott line ask question part quoted. experts keep saying surface transmission rare really spreads, everyone saying important hand washing waking frequently touched surfaces is? transmit well enough surfaces concern,what washing hands doing? I'm trying talk hand wagging missing since seems contradiction. hyper inflation isn’t coming. rather, buried market. Look money QE gone. It’s hands average joes. Hyperinflation happens population large gets much cash hand. money going straight super rich. There’s money economy, it’s getting spent. Money supply getting bigger it’s affecting general public’s purchasing power. Yeah that’s true. like that. one hope comes pass. Yeah man one family members died covid. tested remains forgot open parachute skydiving. 100% covid. Problem idea hard hit countries like Spain sitting 10% less antibodies. near enough bring end on. cities like NYC hitting 20s, maybe see effect least. Sweden's immunity relatively low well.

More likely we're seeing behavioral changes. area hit hard, people take seriously shelter dropping infection rate greatly. We're seeing recent pop Barcelona, showing time complacency Europe either.

And moment we're even sure long immunity lasts. lot question marks still.

I want believe less people fully susceptible think, possible burn closer think, right think vaccine best hope. immunity numbers far low right keep going rate. 

Also areas successfully supressing pandemic one thing common: restrictions. daddy used say, ""A day late dollar short."" Nosewires pinched close nose cheeks help still problems colder. live coastal foggy area chilly evenings even summer. Pretty sure meant smaller scale. Like 5 dead kids limit school district/county get heads asses? 10, 15, 100...? agree center shd helped state . go back u find state wanted control hands remeber central govt identified various zones many state wanted control. also discussion state CM PM state given power decide own. However guidelines still given central govt. Best example State central partnership Delhi . Delhi started struggle central state partnered delhi quite good compared cities. corona nos given individual states centrally think unethical, wait hear world leaders trying reduce testing much possible. take care assets?

&amp;#x200B;

listening team play tonight value me. especially now.

and pay penny. Covid funds fund covid. misunderstanding side. I'm thankful keep kids home long necessary things get safer. 

Yeah sucks missing social-emotional benefits person learning, many compromised anyway new regulations restrictions place try keep things slightly less risky. 

And can't imagine console kids reassure accidentally kill/sicken beloved classmate/teacher/bus driver, etc inevitably happens. think long term negative effects months year distance learning will. probably catch later, assuming survive suffering long term health issues. classmates lucky.

At least know contribute spread pandemic school. fortunate privilege using long situation gets less risky everyone involved. Yeah go there, along millions people looking work!  California, Florida, Mississippi, Texas Arizona hospitals ""overwhelmed"" hear every day, yet states still protests wear masks. get care. Nobody cares. nuts. again, [**your** ""feds abducting antifa members""?

***EDIT:*** u/FilthySeaDog

Added link alt. Right, 'cause like causes severe debilitating mental illness brain damage organic forms...right? Guys? Doubling stupid. citizens developed nations would rather take students provide refuge even though pose risk, condemn stay here. says lot pathetic state US. honestly surprised anyone would want take Americans reckless country acting. Fuck guys. 8th worst world 147 countries works dead keep piling up. Chinas message control broke moment put body bags streets Wuhan. given length time comment response I'm going assume willing invest time required get say, ok get it. teachers, healthcare workers want quit too, included. reusing N95 mask many times count feel safe anymore. insane moment mark Z common sense nation's leading oompa loompa Society literally exist anymore eighteen months lockdown, that's people like understand. world literally collapse. get it, Redditor demographic weird, introverted shut-ins none much different lives pre-COVID, that's case people. lockdowns states imposed ever meant extreme, limited temporary measures, ""new normal"" must adjust indefinitely. thing lot people seem understand going reach point people literally going comply lockdown anymore consider economic social tradeoffs worth it, reaching point many places already. problem applicable concerts. mass gatherings protests would vastly different movement characteristics. terrible text generation bot holy shit Apparently take math know exponential numbers work.... replication cycles matter. thing matter long takes immune system identify respond. Indeed. lesson everyone here. least Disney enforces rules.

Based various theme park vlogs Busch gardens kind free all. Sea world Lego land aren’t getting good reviews either. 

Universal seems ok. 

Not I’d visit right Disney getting flack biggest target, necessarily biggest problem. Thank goodness parents (who listen fox) least enough common sense wear mask. Incompetent idiots? Nope. Good works never die.  safety reasons...hotels dont serve food indoors....pools working limited number people....use online check-in/check-out....rooms dont extra chairs/couches.....beds made yourself. 
So go hotel? know answer, China decontaminating cash back spring. care warning. prefer infected first place (by using real filtering mask FFP2/FFP3) reducing risk spreading covid got it.

I social Jesus type sacrifice myself. one come house, throw money say ""thx"" get infected playing Jesus.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also happily see statistical approach two assumptions:

1. wear handmade mask, infected, spread virus family whole family (equipped masks) start spreading covid

vs.

2).Me family use N95 masks valves. get infected spread virus ill.

&amp;#x200B;

I pretty sure 2. leads less infected people despite government India thinks 1. better way. whole point article masks fact defend inhaling virus thought helped prevent spreading others. Facebook suspend individuals promoting false and/or misleading information masks Covid? government also completely rejected CDC, point hospitals ordered report coronavirus data rich Republican donor's company instead CDC. Thanks, stay safe everybody. Please wear mask. necessarily. leave door open thieves enter makes much harder fight thieves replicating house adding fight working yourself. Shut door fight ones got in. That’s idea behind this. America throw away culture. study mass gatherings movement.

Not actual spreading covid. wealthy, fairly normal middle class background. Super close. Nova Scotia border state directly (ferries run though) forgot Manitoba, Manitobans.

EDIT: Also Saskatoon city province Saskatchewan. Agreed. It’s easy forget individual human impacts. Imagine teams trained literally whole lives may able even practice let alone compete, wild Way slow...omg. Good luck that! anyone else waiting Rona get guy already people learn real? asthma makes covid especially awful feeling, believe increases risk. rural parts county option cheap internet.. expensive satellite literally option agree this.  wait next week? fucking already. far dependent industrial production outsourced China go Cold War 'em.

If US UK want next foreign adventure without prospect success it, without us.

Btw purely democratic throw away mobile phone, definitely contains parts manufactured PRC. also attacks neurological system, hence lost taste smell. But, definitely agree neither cold flu. operates ENTIRELY different. really wish could track many thrown without knowing junk mail. think number larger people think unless read paper truly looked like credit card advertisement know alot people personally dont want credit card various concerns. get bunch people saying swedish plan worked, remember even swedish people believe that. architect original plan resigned disgrace, shows able clean mess

Edit: wrong, resign disgrace, admitted wrong investigated. Death cult. hope someone disease negatively tested crowd.

That's misunderstanding comes in, believe. They're looking actual virus transmission. They're looking surfaces people touch (as shown flourescent hand sanitizer people asked use), patterns people wander socialize (as measured electronic tags they'll wearing record it). They'll use data extrapolate things like, ""Joe Sally stood next Lars Karl throughout performance, one else nearby. That's actually dangerou... wait minute. Intermission. Oh dear, look this. People everywhere, throngs bathrooms, there's flourescent dye EVERYWHERE... ugh. Okay, concerts good, intermission bad."" -- detail, science attached. SHHH! virtue signaling hypocrites here, dont like hear type stuff Majority seniors retire either Florida Arizona. true, vastly expands dating pool saying theme parks essential global pandemic?!!! dude jerk little know him, mess around. Mr Bonesaw, guy hacked journalist pieces, literally canceled Hajj (the important annual Islamic pilgrimage) out-of-state visitors prevent coronavirus spread.

This US president special kind arsehole. saw piece california need shut stop - best cover. 

Florida gets attention aren’t even trying mitigate spread. nurses told ""lives would made hell"" complained conditions coronavirus ward, union raised group grievance 36 employees, nurses, Nottingham University Hospitals said staff Queen's Medical Centre ward trained properly, faced bullying raising concerns denied PPE ""as punishment"". Mobile, AL hospitals full diversion least 5-6 days now. Source? listening EMS radio there. Homelessness. Maybe people snarky condescending towards Facebook users would delete too. 

We shame anyone see scrolling FB public. It’s vortex suck pull people it. mean Visas? Within months, almost everyone know someone died it. Then, staying home problem.    People trying say 100k+ different 86k compared population Dublin alone.

The app shows promise good download numbers need wider adoption people actually check daily start big impact. 

It works released time, I'd call success.

Not mention goodwill action generate globally. Reforms as? least get safeword Exactly. government put hands said “well die, die”. way I’m sacrificing kids agenda may need medical ships disneyworld  [cries american] like 2020 madlib. I'm surprised Tiger King slip somehow. Wear damn mask better take medicine later.

I've stayed Hyatt Hilton (Embassy Suites). Hyatt's breakfast garbage compared omelette station stuff normally have. Embassy Suites still takeout breakfast came breakfast sandwich could warm room, quite good situation. Neither one tell hand changed, disappointed Hyatt. realize vaccination attempting antibody white blood cell (the memory creating antibodies) disease did. likely people disease immune certain amount time, much obvious fact few/none legit cases reinfection.  
People go back line. vaccination would like booster shot would think. sure filters still fine? :) Moisturizing N99 (including HESPA) decreasing filtering ability drastically. valve needed exactly remove moisture.
By way, could tell half mask using? Half masks without valves common thing. wrong. knew world stupid pandemic really made see *how* stupid humanity be. right, resign, admitted wrong investigated. Thanks pointing mistake happiest covid pit earth! Karen? you? city? city country handled coronavirus outbreak far?

I'm pretty sure bet they've handled better US-- even we're talking Brazil (which really 3rd world anymore). thought poorly stocked before, imagine one 3 employees gets sick NSA military legal jurisdiction contractors unless deployed combat zone ship limited circumstances. contractor, broke federal law, prosecuted federal court system comprised judges prosecutors nominated Clinton, Bush, Obama Trump consented Republican Democratic majorities Senate last three decades.

I know it’s 100% protection, I’ve wearing mask since May. I’ve (presumably) exposed one coworkers refusing wear one. came work knowing wife take test day, he’s also sick. 

Maybe, maybe I’ve able protect enough. 

Wear mask. Wash hands. kind other. need know rate people recatching it, severity subsequent infections, transmission rates them. say it’s Gods shit.  thinking Nova Scotia didn’t boarder Us thought Maine close ahh thanks reminding Manitoba, we’ve got group Winnipeg going say Saskatchewan reason thought city Alaska 😂  think time old white man put place everyone else knocked fucking high horse.

I wonder going take politician lap dogs them? Probably not.  brother law believes crap. don’t get like matter much fact sources send it’s always “fake news”.  surprised standard procedure world right now. true China first major country request this? Otherwise, worth reporting? next? China demands people wear masks public? gonna take whole schools teachers dying change anything.  mandatory masks Maryland since April, problem masks indoor spaces. steady declined bars, restaurants, churches gyms opened. we're quickly climbing back up, atleast pretty obvious see caused it.

It understandable Fauci thinks Americans greedy stupid fucks, “masks don’t work” killed people. Asia would’ve resign getting hands knee kowtowing people ask forgiveness. Haha that's funny know thinking us posted. know American, everything us. Also, reason virus continues spike. Partly people like group. know they've looking people city Austin phase III trial:  want high-risk workers regular contact public wonder could somehow poll everyone America right now, many people would report feeling ""fatigue"" ""anxiety"" ""brain fog""? boss right kind hope gets prove stupid self it’s serious shouldn’t simpleton gone Florida. American society already placed pretty low value life, judging every economic policy foreign policy decision last 50 years. source didn’t say anything asymptomatic hypercoagulation. stated many patients asymptomatic covid, already knew. asking source asymptotic covid patients still suffering hypercoagulation. It’s difficult guys even geothermal beaches! Personal hot tub!

Recall impeach force resignation elected officials refuse carry duties pass laws masks. got sweet Edward Snowden/Chelsea Manning treatment mean people get exposed receiving dose. real recession right now. Look stock market!!! agree be, nobody acting like it. Look politics around virus masks. “vaccine” total political nightmare. think need go crazy protecting people themselves. difficult open mail read it. ends junkmail, throw out. bank Bank America. 90% mail send credit card offers. mail sent yesterday check surplus escrow account selling house. accountability 100% least open envelope. bobbies beat. dont even remember last saw police foot. 2 bobbies patrolling pedestrian areas even issue. wish could move stupid debate.

China, Russia, North Korea, Iran host countries trying hack industry institutions news last two decades. fact specific information websites companies subject hacks classified information used help stop activities. Releasing information tells adversaries change tactics got caught instances. help get better releasing stuff. So, helped Russia get better hacking us.

And thousandth time, ""hacking"" election would involve using cyberspace change, adding, deleting votes; candidates/ issues. evidence happened history modern voting. Influencing election happened new, domestic foreign entities conducting activity since democracies existed ancient Greece. seems affected brain. Maybe like get carpentry source next, perhaps something ballet ""prove"" point viruses. They're equally dumb engineering.

Hint, need medical source, actual medical professional, says masks ineffective. Otherwise mashing random facts together.

Again, confidence despite little actually know stunning considered attempted murder, mean charged one dude licking product super market aisle...this far worse putting way ppl risk...

WTF going on?? People travelling around infected others. personal account, business?  one claiming ""secure"". reliably claim intentional tracking it.

Most toilets flush automatically top aerosol fumes air floor. People walk around carry bottom shoe. Americans change shoes indoors.

Also bathroom cramped Enough spread windows. NZ great *everything* including beaches.

That said, think lot people associate sunny beaches tropical weather NZ doesn’t really have. You’re UK temperature-wise even north Auckland you’re getting much 20C half year, either.

But say cardiovascular disease, mean that's one common bodily systems that's targeted impacted even asymptomatic cases.

And also theorized mechanism spreads brain.

But right we're still discovering virus like understanding shifted away respiratory might shift away cardiovascular. problem rich guinea pigs. Sounds like plan. dare *chough* try shut us down. sheep *more coughing* research we, intelligence google. *freedom noises, coughing* Oh people dying number consider large matter. 1.5 million died tuberculosis weren’t enough you? number then? still tens thousands died seasonal flu US...do lives matter enough slightly inconvenienced mask last year? That's important people interact also masked. proof anecdotal.

Even proof, much proof covid numbers suppressed, either incompetence blatant refusal comply. maybe handful deaths marked covid, thousands positive tests inconclusive added totals.

That word mean think does. fun projecting Generally people stupid enough things like care genuinely care less behavior influences, even children.

Makes feel really horrible children. mean, exactly school go back to. use google youtube. Generally, google figure problem youtube find repair.  

So instance last problem capacitor. went outside observed unit every time tried kick on. remember right, unit would start, fan would get kick spin unit would shut since fan run. googled something like ""a/c unit fan start"". Came across sites like [this general forums seemed point capacitor. went youtube found videos like [this gave everything needed repair. Btw, clear day pulled cover capacitor bad looking it. 

You thing learn clean them. really easy, want avoid pressure washers make special cleaners job.  

I'm particularly handy person either. get best say. course things happen A/C unit beyond control. majority people cleaning units usually culprits involved.

Duty obligation applies something like low salary long hours. apply comes PPE. think it. would reaction sent soldiers battle without bullets? Oh interesting. Thanks. letter published tomorrow, April 29, New England Journal Medicine, investigators New York City’s Mount Sinai describe five COVID-19 patients age 50 large vessel strokes two-week period. five, one died, one still hospitalized, two rehabilitation one discharged sent home. five patients mild symptoms COVID-19. Lol It’s funny majority BLM protesters wearing masks. It’s though caring people’s lives also translates activism. made multiple loans taken huge chunk national budget ""covid use"" reality small portion lost majority missing. transparency here, like trump, also making preparations elections, someone party one cronies. Philippines horrible state. amendments protect us like US. freedom speech threatened duterte cronies babies.

A lot could done fight pandemic countries vice president real effort psychotic old man focuses politics, like trump.

The scary thing cases philippines os extremely limited testing. Government claims 50k day testing capacity bull. Majority reported cases always late. super limited testing, lot cases discovered. Philippines situation aint pretty. Yet another article says trending downward 13% positivity rate.. Nothing like manipulating numbers..go Florida! 

Thank people real understanding going on. I'd like unsubscribe plz  Los Angeles’ latest numbers historical case/death charts, running 7-day charts, death rate fairly constant weeks. Cases truly spiking however. That’s something I’m seeing discussed much. Let’s say children teachers don’t die, hospitalized. people realize financial disaster families? people healthcare education emphatic people are. People care profits know know accept less pay less tolerable working conditions people work directly helping people. Mickey wants money bub! PCR Chinese international arrival compulsory since March. I'm saying understood nature virus, would take much seriously. many illegal things going beyond reasoning. Prisoner labor without pay international law, since 50s.

That, lot callous gross negligence. blame media whole mask thing. made polarizing issue making Trump.

Do think could done Trump made polarising issue making Trump? Key word *rural*.

At least VA, rural areas dominated MAGA folks. recent Dr interview Dr Paul Marik (author MATH+ protocol), Dr Marik said HCQ takes 10 days reach lungs - cannot take within 2-3 days symptoms appearing, help:


dr interviews Dr Paul Marik (author MATH+ protocol) - (1 hour 20 minutes)



----

1:04:00 - remove hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) ?

you asking cosmic question difficult answer

HCQ gone beyond science - become political, economic - become religion


we need focus science

the first thing HCQ pharmokinetics extremely unusual interesting

when take HCQ quite well absorbed gets taken red blood cells (RBCs) - high concentrations, rapidly

and gets released RBCs serum

the half-life exceedingly long - 50 days

it takes 6 months reach steady state blood levels

(what mean - mean constantly taking level rises input matches output via 50 day half-life ?)

rheumatoid arthritis/lupus patients tell takes 6 months see therapeutic effect ..


it takes 5 days maybe even 10 days get adequate HCQ levels lung

just taken RBCs, released serum, taken tissues

and kinetics really important understand

what means acutely ill now, going work


----

1:07:00 - think HCQ may role taken early symptomatic phase

within first 2-3 days symptoms - that's it

because pulmonary phase begins day 9-10


by time progress pulmonary adequate lung levels HCQ


so dont think HCQ role hospitalized patient

i think missed boat takes long (to reach adequate lung levels)


----

1:08:00 - think HCQ role early - may even role prophylaxis

in south africa used take HCQ week prevent malaria

because long half-life



----

1:08:20 - second thing think taken zinc

zinc HCQ go hand hand

HCQ zinc ionophore, think zinc makes much potent drug

thats problem many studies HCQ using zinc



----

1:09:00 - dose important - study used ridiculously toxic dose

if give toxic levels, going toxic

i think study designed kill people

so bottom line is, theoretically works

the problem science today really good


----

1:09:40 - look papers - Dr Raoult - science bad - papers good papers

the science bad difficult make strong recommendations based really poor studies

(should asked poorer countries lacking medicines, advisable would take HCQ prophylactically ?)


----

1:10:00 - Dr - add observation early phase

i treat patients aggressively HCQ soon feel patient going covid19 route

and today whatever patients managed never ended serious situations

so point making - place early on, zinc, hospitalized patients


----

1:10:30 - also think dose important - Dr Zelenko used 200mg x2 per day

i think good dose

once start using 800mg (per day) 1000mg/day start getting cardaic issues

i think use low dose HCQ (200mg x 2 per day) - zinc - safe


----

1:10:50 - Dr - same

and way Dr Zelenko us tomorrow



----

1:16:00 - Dr Bean - discussing doctor friend - made mess - stuck HCQ early steroids MATH+ protocol initially recommended - simple protocol - would saved lot lives

and (complicated landscape drugs) - antiviral immune suppressant

this become mess - could saved lives - save lives now


Dr Paul Marik - absolutely - think good science - got covid19, HCQ home waiting - going hesitate

so think got sensible

so agree - things prophylactically

when get symptoms got take HCQ zinc prevent deteriorating first

patients get worse - get MATH+ - think simple

make simple

take politics it

take economics it

i think moral duty humanity right thing


----

1:18:30 - Dr - think complicated - politics, economics, big pharma - big mess


i agree you

worst thing vulnerable people never protected - people long term care facilities - nursing homes

i think shocking whats happened them


they given

- vitamin d

- vitamin c

- prophylactic HCQ probably 

and protected sometimes try engage types pop social media it’s losing battle try convince them.

It’s like religious dogma, construct narrative inbuilt defences contradicting evidence. don’t accept expert option scientific evidence apparently scientists researchers part well, they’re biased paid whichever shadowy lot apparently behind everything. yet study indicates severe symptoms higher viral loads. Isn’t amazing always find something internet prove point? Seems odd cases keep dipping ever since Trump forced hospitals bypass CDC. Youre absolute moron im actually done responding you.

See comment read fucking links dipshit post.

It’s right there


Drosten Corona: Virus could mutate adapt better people

In future, SARS-CoV-2 could even mutate order reproduce transmit even better nose, explains virologist Drosten possible option. mutation could adapt better humans. also shown study University Oxford, examined development various corona populations.

“This adjustment lead transferred better, staying nose becoming simple cold,” said Drosten.

Virus could become harmless future

This advantage due evolution, symptoms severe, people isolate earlier infect fewer people. alternative could also coronavirus mutates severe course disease. would disadvantage virus, wants spread much possible.

“This virus epidemics generally weaken,” says Drosten. many different examples past. could happen SARS-CoV-2. Bc final phase vaccine trial takes time. Typically 14 months observation make sure adverse effects. piggy back vaccines human body weird changing one thing screw everything up. can't fast forward time, even vaccine released low success rate likely need multiple shots even get us back normal right away. Wearing mask week, wearing mask often dosent make someone mask wearer.

You know need terms mask wearing.

You speculating.

My point, people say wear masks, want argue it.  Hopefully new administration pardon immediately. Boo hiss! Well, let stupid shop then. Poor clerks suffer it. What, talking about? Oh come don’t think anything CNN bias towards one particular group? cruelty feature, bug. insane? people medical practice less ability strike roles saving lives. less right refuse unsafe work. yeah, let’s let everyone die! point man go back next Wednesday. share office two people. One got back vacation Texas beach shared house friends. shared pictures beach complaining packed was. Another coworker currently Florida vacation comes back weekend. Neither quarantined two weeks neither wear masks unless explicitly required to. idea they'll keep offices; currently district requiring staff Texas governor is, know district require when/if state longer requires them.

So yes, I'm worried. would recommend rocket Alpha Centaury. beatings continue morale improves. accept Sisyphus, get stronger day rolling bolder hill. mans speaking truth. Viruses         0.005 - 0.3 microns
Paint pigments    0.1 - 5 microns

N95               0.3 microns
Surgical mask      60 microns
High thread cotton 300 microns Okay Mao. Nobody wears masks California? Get nonsense personally wouldn’t take vaccine that’s rolled quickly. I’m far anti-vaxxer.  never understood hate got. kid one day want like her. She’s braver adults know including myself. locked weeks starting March April, slowly reopened directed medical experts, maintaining strict social-distancing always wearing masks indoors public, we'd saved many thousands lives, still talk now. people wanted ""get back normal"" right away, assured able long time yet. 

Other countries handled fine, exactly said, they're well. youngest kid literally sick September March. everyone washing hands every morning, bathroom break, lunch, throughout day. sink soap right classroom. teacher neat freak overall clean. endless supply lysol clorox wipes. Hand sanitizer every table. class still constant colds, stomach bug, head lice, flu hand foot mouth. thankfully spared lice stomach bug ridiculous. literally looking people side mask debate enemies. Rightly so, danger humanity.

Yet, willingness kill us gives us vitriol return wish death towards them.

It's nasty situation ignored. going ideological warfare worldwide dont something propaganda machine. noted average age cases FL started low (probably propelled partiers working class people show up). could explain mortality remained relatively low. concern rise infections spread average age increases hospitals already saturated. true.  didnt see outdoor part. ok actually oopsie daisies! Wow wonder like functional government actually cares .-. 

To fair, boost UE checks $600 per check start, good chuck population would homeless overnight, runs next month that's fun. Good sacrifice yourself. get make choice everyone, however. selfish want live. clearly idea talking about. please tell state lived recently still work (remotely) conforms political understanding. 

Montana purple Democrats unwavering, socially liberal Democrats. They're gun-owning, blue collar workers. Montana socially progressive stretch, secure place Democrats here. True wonder much well connected wealthy people contributed current state affairs D.C. respective states. wealthy well connected way influence us regular folks. 

It kinda feels like they’ve helped make mess they’re fleeing. Pathetic. Checks. heard anyone getting debit cards. haven’t able get general public actually quarantine point process what’s makes think would done get go? know mask wearers still get it, also know cut spread viral dose...people still don’t comply wearing mask, people still won’t socially distance, let’s blame Fauci. 

We get told lies daily current POTUS aren’t protect anyone himself. Fauci making calculated call, knowledge had, protect greater good. Without medical professionals it’s impossible fight battle. Like go war, don’t give tanks civilians. 

Our government sorta made masks. DPA invoked nothing done gate, wait hands approach Trump. mistake shouldn’t pin Fauci. give ideas, mickey holding cans beans. I'd like see suspended airplane, underwear blame squarely Trump inept administration. question Trump’s actions inactions behest Putin simple ineptitude. US burning, didn’t bad. Actually, PR one things care about. Money numbers computer them. California taken illusion combating virus. county county thing hurting rural counties. everything I'm Bay area shut down? 

You bring coronavirus Tahoe.  Can’t kill Golden Mouse preferred Moa. thing experienced much response. fake coughing worst. lost faith humanity. FL pretty much everything Ft Pierce/Vero Beach south. Central FL Daytona. North Florida everything N that.  


But really breaks farther that. SW Florida Ft Myers Marco Island Tampa Bay area Venice/Sarasota Crystal River Pan Handle basically deep south like AL. reading right, even complete results people studied, right? can't believe people run school.

Anyone understand rules elementary schools make kids lick fingertips run towards kids laughing/yelling ""I'll give covid! Haha"" really know kids. Troll 1. Consent participants
2. Precautions taken

Unlike experiment we're getting ready run children US schools. Indeed. Tennessean here. sad truth around actions, disproportionate group people shown empathy ends discomfort begins. Couple willfull ignorance self imposed echo chambers got recipe disaster. Dont take numbers face value. Florida testing less week ago. Look positivity value. north 19% rising. Still. problem article discussion ""death rate"".

That this:

Most calculations use total known cases total known dead.

It total closed total known dead.

I understand interval calculations used epidemiology understand comparing current cases plus closed cases cases resulted death.

Some currently I'll going die increase proportion died thus raise ""death rate"" quite significantly.

When calculating closed cases survivors/dead mortality consistently around 7-9%.

It gets lower add people still sick plus unknown number asymptomatic unreported cases. Nail head. 

People confused mental health narrative kids need back schools misconstrued implies kids need back schools way things schools won’t like reasons mentioned. 

This different everyone wishing hoping life go back normal summer, it’s let’s hope wish get back “normal” fall sending kids back. 

This create second wave tbh. 

The lax environment speak undoubtedly situation teachers faculty feel overwhelmed already stressful demanding job (have tried watch educate 20 kids day?), undoubtedly gets lot tougher due necessity keep strict guidelines place. Teachers bend, even break. remember decent percentage population voting Trump, believes things claims. 

As much hope people educating children aren’t following guidance, it’s reasonable assume are. 

So happens “cool” teacher doesn’t require class wear masks doesn’t believe them. 

It’s going ridiculous. give month there’s issues reported nationally Lol, one talk COVID response without involving politics. ..  

Must nice able keep head sand guise ""all politics bad."" Well Duh. people need realize Oxford Moderna vaccines require two shots several weeks achieve immunity. Took creative liberties title there. prelim results - study published yet custodial staff. administration. food service staff. 

Do morons think adults taking care kids school? psychological phenomena known [collapse psychology behind Stalin's quote, ""If one man dies hunger, tragedy. millions die, that’s statistics."" We're biologically wired care 1 death million, horrific is. Probably blocked automod doubt they'd frame ""teaching kids stand oppression"". well agree, hand: Oxford study lot promise right? Luckily citizen Sweden, whose prime minister Stefan Löfven. One dirty kid might become superspreader. food banks, homeless still better dead bankrupt due medical bills. Disney employees don’t go home vaccine already produced SARS/MERS family virus, along development that. basically able repurpose work they'd done. vaccine tweaked target COVID-19, along vaccines. interesting. Thanks sharing got rewatch Children Men. movie gritty good terrifying bleak way Oh brainwashed controlling government *totally* makes us best.

((Because teaching us better everyone else whole lives government able take medical rights away agree lifestyle sooooooo different)) point stupid. Less tests, we're winning! /S that's happens tribe chief gets comfortable billionaire bunkers stories bit exaggerated. may actual handful rich people bought house cellar. ""Lining countryside"" bit much. They’re certainly planning already that. wife's friends (not even ultra wealthy, private medical practice pay) voted donated people caused bad response Texas, yet went summer home Colorado wait whole thing out. entire planet need take 2x. None one-shot vaccines even close Oxford results. friend said doctors told virus mutated although it’s contagious it’s less deadly. best thing wear mask, keep windows open much possible try directly interact anyone house. house constantly sanitized much possible. lot education could tracked poem. Mental health resources. issue ""fence"" usually nearly concrete idea poem suggests, people trouble recognizes benefits abstract versus real. ever moved new country? hard.

Again, requirement candyass. unable move without toy poodle grandmother's curio, yeah, hard.

And keep citing cost somehow prohibitive. Leaving aside ""jump wade across river clothes back"" option, easy sense decide 2 days' notice, making much harder obviously (given number people it). Cytokine storms bad news causes well (immunotherapy, instance). wonder would effective cases well. bottles ingested truth? shocking! would like believe part defaming campaign vested interests yea people still seem call names. Mickey says, ""Gosh, Minnie! [Don't fear Haha!"" **We work.**

Countries like New Zealand Canada gave citizens money (their tax dollars) survive follow guidelines. result less infected less dead per capita.  Found conservative! I'll bet dont wear mask significantly downplay virus Yeah, guess proper credentials required address specific issues.... might well throw Mickey Mouse wave everyone. saw somewhere phone app helps that. Turns spoken words large type text read grew Florida, still friends Facebook many people knew high school. Facebook filled anti mask stuff. It’s sad dumb US. whole Western world considered weird Asian thing. like listening fire alarm go one else getting escape, want look like weirdo flees?

Yet major problem getting people leave building fire. people think they'd course leave, research area shows lots people would rather conform.  also protect, protect, collective individual freedomsand rights people infringes selfinterest. freedom ends freedom starts etc etc. Ohh get now, literally idea about.  Thank you, you. worth, country faired better mine per-million population basis. hope soon possible. really us everything limit spread. AntiSemite too. state mandatory mask law, many sheriff departments come said enforce it. people lots counties aren’t wearing masks. legitimately afflicted really good idea get worked something statistically far less likely harm things comfortably live with? south desert now? Midwest, desert too? Agenda?

I don’t agenda. spent four years thousands dollars **studying history** college, I’m going stand let uneducated Reddit rando spew false facts. 

The romanticization women housework blurred history misled people like yourself. 

Even colonial America, women worked OUTSIDE home. apothecaries, blacksmiths, sextons. barbers, tavern keepers, printers. women, widows, even *owned* businesses themselves. 

These legit jobs. women stayed home cooked/cleaned. fact, didn’t.  That's probably why. emasculates getting attention good person, get selfish promoting causes. Like right selfish destroy shit everyone freedoms.

Then here's young woman making impact world, changing it. know never same. make us united... redistrubution funds countries expense taxpayers already taxed countries world fuel criticism EU 

You cant high taxes spend momey non taxpayers/citizens countries. obviously make taxpayers angry  positivity rate also roof giant concern. exactly see peak? case avoid wizards promising adventure Self-fulfilling username. it? Wasn’t Florida Getting 13000 cases day days last week? called realistic. vaccines accelerated still near mass consumption. best, nothing. worst? one knows safety yet. neighbors two houses drove SC week day got back heard one parents complaining quarantine seven days get tested (were suburbs NYC). Guess whose car gone later night. [Draft landscape Covid-19 candidate Vaccines currently Phase III trials:

Unfortunately, every single one exists teh premise people power enact measures job good faith. half (or more) government acting bad faith, amount checks balances fix it.  hate speech. kind thinking got us today. yearning mythical past never real. hope design NEW future. Trying go back something never really (or least everyone) make things worse long run. So... Yes mess Texas? Jesus. Get room, two. Asian countries internalized mask-wearing long ago. Yep, budgeting important skill learn. I'm sorry struggling too.

I keep getting distracted car comment. like model cars?   quit cannot get unemployment. hire uncertified people teach. contingencies laws constitution release early even knew final status patients? Pew updates poll regularly compliance still majority high.


Not media promotes stories equally. quite common certain stories minimized openly pushed.

And clarification irrelevant. people wear masks support masks. evidence supports that.

You want Reddit rules lawyer try explain really case requires way speculation me. ""head sand"" effective strategy? Odd. I, parent, thinking whole thing insane. wish kids back school, we're Oklahoma, live outskirts OKC.  


We cannot afford anyone stay home kids, childcare astronomical three kids, ultimate rock/hard place issue.  


Outside another shutdown able work home again, proving really tough make sure they're taken care one way another. tell people: slow winning please! didn’t say didn’t like Lancet. publish data. You’re supposed read publish think says spew incorrect drivel. 

Yes published Lancet.

Like riding motorcycle without helmet. Except makes likely everyone around also get injured fill hospitals there’s place sick/injured people go. want best children maybe start realizing reopening schools way go. children immune virus. severe cases deaths. smaller viral load supposed make less sick. see helping fend get really sick, going divide anyways. make less sick?

If doctor, know better.

Of course experience, doctors tend intellectually uncurious bio-majors aren’t medicine tracks. Look guy's comment history see useless reply comment makes. American healthcare tied job, no? Medical staff first responders will. 


Then average citizens. varies massively country.

In UK, pretty much exactly describe - contact tracer get touch ask list everywhere they've previous days ask contact details everyone know they've within meter they've within two meters 15 minutes more.

In places like Germany Ireland, also interviews use contact tracing app well. someone tests positive find whose phones near person's phone longer minutes relevant days.

In places like South Korea (I think), take another step further. use person's credit card details see shops they've to, they'll use CCTV identify they've near, etc.

The fewer cases country, wider cast net one person confirmed positive. got dozen cases whole country ask everyone who's supermarket confirmed case isolate get test!

Mayyybeee could get behind that, theoretically, maybe? BUT:

The current government regulations shit show. There's national, comprehensive strategy, Trump arguing CDC guidelines, we've reached point like COVID grenade passed around like hot potato, one wants end taking it.

The headline suggests one thing, dig article, find data actually something usually far less explosive.

Here another perfect example came past days.

[Over half coronavirus patients Spain developed neurological problems, studies obvious first reaction ""Holy Crap! half Covid patients ended brain damage!"" (or something along line).

But read article see talking symptoms developed *at hospital*, reference ""long lasting"" Segura, co-authored study, common symptoms experienced coronavirus patients myalgia, headaches dizziness. points nearly 20% also presented disorders consciousness, although symptoms concentrated among elderly patients. Another 20% patients (they exclusive groups) developed neuropsychiatric problems insomnia, anxiety psychosis. “Some symptoms, like myalgia, insomnia headaches, observed previous studies,” adds Segura, also teaches University Castilla-La Mancha.


So, example, Covid patient got headaches insomnia hospital part symptoms, part ""Half Coronavirus patients developed neurological problems"" article talks about.

But people walk away article line saying ""It's proven half Covid patients end permanent neurological damage!""

And enough people saying that, kind becomes ""public consensus"".

""Well everyone knows even survive Covid good chance live brain damage"".

And affects public policy. 

So .. yah. get bit peeved articles like this.

Because *dangerous*.

For record - havent seen single article study proves *at all* common experience serious long-term effects Covid.

There people nasty *short term* outcomes. (Like Nick Cordero), *other* people shown lingering long-term traces illness. 

But seen *anything* proving ""even survive Covid good chance f*cked life*.""

But heck lot people seem think proven. Florida broken. unemployment system mess. Governor wants people go work, wants businesses pay people, rather helping people government money. lot people get paid unemployment. money go people receive? without person option.

Yes, they're saying evolution RaTG13 SARS-CoV-2 happened 2012 single freak infection event human. Then, without evidence whatsoever, claim lab froze evolved virus 2019 broke out.

What I'm saying assume rapid evolution happen single human being, either got incredibly unlucky, else rapid evolution RaTG13-type virii SARS-CoV-2 vastly likely thought. since know RaTG13-type virii exist wild, lots human beings contact bats caves, vastly increases prior natural encounter causing evolution SARS-CoV-2 years 2012, without need invoke lab escapes (for zero evidence.)

TL;DR: accept ""rapid evolution vastly likely"" theory, lab really seem like likely vector infection anymore. really keeps night people scared ruminate last year earth...then catch wind hospital actually die it....Thats damn sad frightening..... That's fair, forget too.

Also article satire case wondering, view Onion, Hard Times, Babylon Bee. hate Trump much next guy fact matter even parents unlikely die (as parents school aged children 65+). deny sending kids back cause additional deaths, alternative is, opinion, far dangerous long term. difficult issue, though. So, Mets Yankees going play 60 times upcoming baseball season? think people forgetting. getting vaccine day one even month one. lot logistics involved vaccinating whole population. vaccines also need stored specific temperatures, create challenges distributing  ""showing off"" actually handling glass water like adult one latest rallies really...uncomfortable.  Republicans spend trillions food stamp system rife people taking advantage needs overhaul,

Studies show mostly fox urban try put $13 trillion complete overhauls systems need overhauled multiple times per session. 

Healthcare guzzles trillions gives rich. Literally thousands times worse food stamps. really depends effectiveness vaccine, even strongest vaccines provide something like 90% protection diminishes time... little doubt early candidates substantially less effective 90% means vaccine wouldn’t suit armor think would be... probably less effective wearing mask means people would still rely public mask wearing protection. again, public capable wearing masks effectively, problem wouldn’t nearly bad is. 

A vaccine isn’t going save us ultimately isn’t immunity problem, it’s stupidity problem. We’re country large swath population believes science liberal hoax designed hurt them. think it'll them. anyone know. That's it.

What's unique virus compared homicides starvation simply avoid risk staying away people. putting danger, force others share worry? I've using  time now, however Reuters reported today yesterday, California reported 12k new cases.

That's really far wondering is, wtf parents thinking sending kids back?

They tired babysitting kids and/or want go back work. guess low confidence we'll mass vaccinations place next summer... sad news. like 2-3 weeks atleast. agree continue examine safety.

Yup Asking honestly then, ID, risk people get cell phones? use disposable? right, poor old grandpa 'surprised' birthday murdered. entirely defenseless old lady home elderly. 

It's heartbreaking. friend’s daughter deaf. must interact strangers wears teeshirt says, “I deaf. read, write, sign.” It’s interesting many people know enough ASL get by.  Vaccines work infected people Perhaps first deserved lynching history America. I'm sorry. need evolve understanding fatality.

There's death result initial infection. know this.

But longer term questions regarding lifespans increased risk factors survivors. example severe enough warrant lung transplants.

These patients might survive initial infection lung disease. everyone eligible lung transplant.

And honestly fucking clue systemic implications like hypercoagulation, neurological damage, diabetes, kidney failure, etc.

Lastly, understand long herd immunity last. 40% infected, leaves another 40% collapse health care system. also know reinfection there's emerging evidence suggests herd immunity might turn people asymptomatic carriers although evidence really new peered. kids still easily spread others, like parents grandparents, far vulnerable. supposed infected, contacts people, surfaces stuff like gets electronically tracked simulations like people propping children push policies. agree climate change problem need real solutions for, majority scientific community. see done besides rich parents got spot stage perform speech. anything, divisive, may pushed back public opinion climate change.

Look, hospital burns gonna complain everyone time terminal cancer, deep coma, currently wide open operating table recorded fire death? No. complain people die COVID? Sorry America nobody cares... saying right. think Star Wars different it’s kids thing.
And mean like wearing Mickey stuff outside Disney.
But I’m glad enjoy that’s great. Sure can! bring home, let kill family, spend TIME WORKING HAPPY TOWN!

The Mouse approves! Well Americans, cool billionaires lived ruthlessly exploited countries. ready become one ruthlessly exploited countries? tell living bay areans outdoorsy shit. 

California can't control Nevada pickle living state borders. 

There lots solutions chosen none them. anecdote but.

Just appointment pulmonologist. told hospital normally 10 ICU beds. peak hospital converted 30 normal beds ICU beds 27 occupied covid patients 9 non covid. 

They pull doctors staff beds. 

Wasn’t part discussion would suspect people would normally ICU beds get sent normal beds make space critical patients.  People would normally beds, get sent home. means people die.

Also staffing ICU doctors normally ICU, standard care go down. 

Ultimately expect number non covid related deaths much higher average past years, fixed resources, can’t scale capacity without lowering quality. Masks uncomfortable, especially it’s hot.

Americans generally didn’t wear masks coronavirus. masks visual reminder things aren’t like before.

The Americans wear masks coronavirus generally Asian descent. people racist Asians coronavirus originated China (never mind spread since then, get people race). wearing mask means you’re like them.

Politics. Certain political figures made minimizing threat coronavirus political statement.

Masks promoted way protecting others, protecting yourself. requires admitting might coronavirus, would mean impure. you’re wearing mask protect yourself, think pure, protecting impurity people. people don’t want inconvenience protect others, especially think others somehow inferior done something deserve getting Covid. even see wanting protect others sign weakness.

None these, course, VALID reasons wearing mask. anti-maskers need GROW realize world doesn’t owe mask-free existence, even that’s way it’s always them. think got love way around.

A delay reporting happened before; numbers delayed hours times, given problems weekend, I'm bit worried going enter information blackout. Hopefully I'm paranoid parrot. 


That's especially bothersome personally, community OK started spiking last 7 days (\~ 35% gain cases time, large public events last week.) dont think gonna christmas, vaccine expected september/October, atleast highest risk people vaccinated along healthcare workers, drastically drop community spread, death rate would absolutely plummet vast vast vast majority deaths risk older people. Everyone talking remdesivir, readily available (for world), expensive

Certain hospitals catchment areas, hospitals never allowed close unless there’s internal disaster, close certain pts critical equipment (eg CVAs CT down). Base hospitals aren’t really supposed close, definitely do. Smaller hospitals close fairly regularly, experience number people waiting room, necessarily number ambulance crews holding wall. people waiting several hours waiting room, close ambulances start treating patients. Also, ever close ALS level calls, can’t close BLS level calls since BLS runs don’t require contact thus they’d clue hospital diversion unless ReddiNet rig. agree law place soon honestly effective reach heard immunity. bothers masks random times need wear one. gov telling need wear mask I'm working need wear mask wait seated restaurant?

I’m fine paying little extra money quality services. You’re entitled enjoy “free” services, like said, get pay for. equal causation. Europe, japan, south korea huge massive protests across entire country? caused massive spread.

The protests little effect infection rate, held outside (and still are) wearing masks. clue come another conclusion, since every source found googling states correlation protests infection we're going get eventually matter kills fewer peiple flu year.

I'm assuming work college visa something ran out? 


How pay Taxes legally can't employed? Insider explanation. true get see many masks outside, virus spread much open air environment. think trick lays avoiding big gatherings (a couple friends okay) use masks inside - live North virus took toll area elsewhere - there's social distancing public transport, everyone wears masks inside. Literally everyone  annoying. SHOCKED Iowa one fewest restrictions. governor cares less governor (Missouri) Amount people Netherlands tested positive doubled within week. Experts worried I'm getting really ominous feeling this. lot people really lax regarding corona rules lately showing, really feel 'ready' second wave yet. Lets hope spike coming weeks. People aren’t obeying now, social distancing 6 months pipe dream begin with. makes feel better appendectomy fingers crossed land ICU per protocol.  sounding like uncomfortable little girl telling do.

Well, no, I’m asking actual solutions. easy say climate change biggest worry, address putting non-metaphorical food table? 

You can’t solve climate change vacuum. Demanding countries meet climate goals won’t shit export pollution. Demanding climate change action won’t worth doesn’t improve people’s lives. 

Just like AOC’s Green New Deal, sounds great, hits many talking points it’s solution. It’s great Greta wants sounds alarm, she’s preaching choir. mean... college keeping tuition same... want graduate ASAP guess I'm gonna it, hope normal semester spring. think Florida laid bunch unemployment workers even harder get claims processed **4th July** lot it, 18 days ago. basically Hunger games then.  Well, duh. one's going pay $50,000 pocket zoom class couple days week.

Now, mommy daddy's pocketbook care, that's different lifestyle working asses save tens thousands go school.

Going gap year lot people year figure stuff out. Dead customers buy less dollar shit. It’s fact. remember invented chocolate. well know still think could figure way turn two keys simultaneously hacking lung Sorry dual Phase 1/2 April.

Phase 3 end said they'd know Mid-June showing kid, I'd draw notebook paper 64 color crayon box (first grade flex) mom would always tell proud making beautiful art, would put office walls, would always ask good artist? 

Maybe people Trump.  someone who’s always wanted travel US (and saving money pacific/ southwest trip) I’m going long time. Fall/Winter combined apathy everyone meeting indoors fuck us. Sweden I'm worried current downwards trend plateaus rather continue much lower levels infection, we'll rapidly outbreaks country come October/November.

Masks derided, testing especially tracing lacklustre sick told stay home. Even households members COVID-positive people told keep working/going school unless get symptoms.

Oh, schools open late August, elementary (was never closed) universities. imagine kid would feel ended-up killing mother father, one grandparents, brought back covid-19 home? rest lives, guilt, ""maybe could've safer"".

When reality would cockroaches elected officials. I'm curious happens month now? guess theyll keep pushing month later even goes way til spring. Texas giving high school football I'm doctor, dude. Nurses great, trained differently. Love nurses. see things different perspective.  think points working failing. failed, I'd assume would come right say it. lose releasing failed vaccine. worked, makes sense keep quiet now. end August know sure. patient. obligated release data ready to. Oh come on... saw episode “Magic Schoolbus” answer article linked post. adjust testing volume I’d say must take lot energy convince that’s good idea you’re working half brain mental gymnastics aren’t complicated. believed hell I’d hope surgeon general rots there.

Who could predicted lying effectiveness masks - regardless motivation - would negative impacts trust compliance? Ok get I'll note Idaho dashboard hospitalizations:

*Note:* July 15, HHS Secretary Azar notified hospitals stop reporting COVID-19 data NHSN. facilities Idaho began reporting directly HHS via TeleTracking 7/15. Data 7/15 may capture hospitalizations ICU admissions facilities transition new data submission processes. ...aaaand fuck  accurate portrayal Mouse ever.

Lol, Mod-censored responses you? Looks like hit nerve. It’s nothing personal- record, don’t hate Russia. good night. Yeah live Europe, worst France cash something really normal. France, try use card dislike tracing it.
At least downvoting, nice American understands cash usual Yeah, that's weird. control pol--l correctness. Well, actually, p correctness control p---cally correct. always wonder definition ""essential"" since beginning pandemic.

Since start, entire building emptied ""skeleton staff"" left keeping going. Everyone else gone remote, skeleton staff keep going.

While vague, billions dollars work continues flow building, except 6 people filtering instead usual 500+. work before. 

Since never stopped working, ""essential workers""? Without team, barely work would processed. Communication would stop. People get things need. Remote access work.



When hear *""essential workers""* think *""Doctors literally putting gasping covid patients oxygen gear""*, think myself.

Yet, we've subway every day. We've masking up. Processing mail people believe Covid exists. still get risks. We're well paid, technically ""front line workers"", even though feel like one really.

Dunno, food thought. want bars stay closed everywhere world pandemic over. Yes. propaganda truth well. directly implied testing amount going down. not. part said misleading unless retarded. Quit trying justify horseshit. grandparents children... parents, see got mixed up.

You're absolutely right, government's fault, less leverage due see problem. people literally can't survive without job anymore. worry people care, going send kids school without mask and/or COVID Let's actually see evidence stole hundreds millions. conjecture, actual proof. 

Do know difference dollar amount irrelevant issue corruption? Ffs can't even agree corruption issue! focused $ amount! dude... c'mon now. guy. oh thats good idea! managed two binder clips rubber band, seems working except rubber tangling hair, might upgrade actual hair ties Yessir.

But UK seems boat maybe months ahead us. seems push back normal cases/deaths decline, even tho clear virus still clearly there.

I figure happen here. Godspeed. know say really.  mean Pfizer?
[Pfizer BioNTech Agree Supply U.K. 30 Million Doses Covid-19 set goodDayM mentioned. Pfizer vaccine looking good far, think they're phase behind. Gotta agree you, man. never meant political issue - public health issue.

For example: way rest world operated live anyone high risk? you’ve got piece shit POTUSA get. get suspend group like this?? There’s one town it’s causing havoc. way fault facts.

But can't responsible? horrible things like happen throughout history. Many lasted far longer. People do. possible entitled selfish people now? Username checks scalability RNA virus production also still bit unknown factor, could potentially delay large scale availability. adenovirus vector vaccines use standard production methods. 1. Thank proving point. Covid-19 fact new, therefore cannot understood 1 size fits all.

2. discovered earth revolved around sun 500 years ago, thousands claim. incorrect.

3. never said anything wrong wearing mask choose find funny quickly entire populice jumps bandwagon people ""think"" solution. cant make blanket statement look someone making exact choice wear one. doesnt make selfish slightest, what's selfish pushing fear onto everyone else. Comply say I'm scared, sorry that's world works dont need conform make feel safe. Dementia test passing experts... Camels spit vitriol I'm pretty sure. Sure shit seemed one spit me. “Why not?” think know well went 244 years ago Government controlled every aspect life “the greater good.” I’d rather shitbags don’t care safety shitbags hold power control life. brown. That's GOP's goal November. Allowing companies organizations fail lets process happen significantly reduces wealth inequalities disproportionately affect top assets rather deriving income wages.

That's really true. 

The senior executives large companies already financially set life even companies go bankrupt disappear. even though *need* ever work again, every single one get multiple high-paying job offers companies; penalty corporate failure. middle class employees companies suffer most. Inequality deepened. 

In addition, wealthy corporate assets. large percentage (in cases, majority) corporate shares held mutual funds, retirement accounts, pension funds, etc., say owned middle class people depending money retirement basic living expenses. shares become worthless, impact middle class shareholders *far* worse impact wealthy (who scarcely affected all). Again, inequality made worse, better.

Then next people social gatherings without masks 

I live live Bay Area mask common. inside business without mask 4 months it’s pretty much everyone. think Fox News viewers listen black guy mask?  homes set temporary morgues. Crematoriums running overtime. Families must wait week bury loved ones. body couriers funeral workers, there’s letup sight.  Darling! would like move kids next month? called priorities dude, protesting right people, especially fucked political climate. Seems convenient government even though ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY people continue go ""essential"" service jobs, matter protesting, suddenly ""dangerous irresponsible""...you keep spinning narrative around.

All people claim badly ""NEED"" vacation.

Americans selfishness really reached new heights people can't vacation months order less people die. care little fellow Americans they're non-pulsed 140K+ American deaths.

Nope. Fuck that, I'll take loss Plenty Big Businesses pay taxes get Corona money either. process business get access $$ completely different insanely problematic issue itself.

You're making strawman argument comparing two things equal.

We got around $3600 something due situation, showed via wire transfer bank account instantly day supposed to. hate LATimes reason. got well Ahhh bystander effect incarnate.

Nobody expecting assaulted saying something another person.

But hey it’s best let people bad/stupid shit get away instead saying something right? /s also dismissive opinions nurses. Besides patient, think valuable witnesses doctors malpractice suits? Nurses.

Thanks Reagan! daughter starts senior year high school year, county California high rate coronavirus, governor ordered schools remain closed offer online classes only. Goyal stated article, 14% students nationwide even internet access. Even schools reopen, social distancing impossible classroom 30 students.

At time, daughter really needs around people, even stay six feet apart. think Goyal's piece offers refreshing new ideas help children get real education, time protecting health students teachers. I'm saying he's right everything, get hung one word.

New Zealand one isolated island countries world, South Korea (also effectively relatively small island, without usual land border) excellent organization, likely singular people, preexisting 'epidemic culture', strong enforcement dissolution American even European would call 'civil rights'.

I live one untouched Western countries world, would quite better singular enforcement single government directive adhered all, without intellectually poverished people standing way., name 'democracy' 'freedom'.

America land ""I got mine, fuck you"" holy shit, like Detroit become human middle pandemic.  Phase 1’s main focus safety, true, sample size large enough justify testing volunteers Phase 2 volunteers Phase 3.

Phase 3 examines efficacy safety across (ideally) demographics exposed virus strains currently circulating. might look phase 3 safety group vaccine provokes too-aggressive/inflammatory immune response, exacerbate lung injury. 

This vital ensure vaccine cause harm. Results encouraging wait frustrating, corners cut risk lives lost, loss public trust vaccine programs future. Whats crazy 99% survival rate stuff. death percentage 1% means 3 million Americans die 15-20 million get hospitalized, millions intubated, millions permanent lung damage heart damage killed 53x americans flu. mention, ICUS full anywhere virus spreads...how dangerous? Til freaking 150,000 people dead. 

Sure, nation grilled Secretary State years 4 (and made misleading movie it). completely upended foreign policy 20 years regarding 2500 dead (and made lot misleading movies it). freaking concerned 150,000 dead *and end sight*. 

I think post coming good place, noted still First Wave. wave discrete meaning matter distinct curve national data line graph. 

The first wave never ended. tamped NYC fairly well, top minds let numbers guide nationally premature reopening back May first wave continued simmer 49 states. 

The results plain see. still grossly mismanaged first wave. Right, time Republicans cut Bill Clinton's spending left surplus fiscally conservative. Damn forgot. Republicans, majority, fiscally conservative track record show it. sound like new politics system hospitals remain active, alive, well.

If becomes real problem, system easily prioritize care pre-paid customers, leave poor die streets.

Have ever seen hospital poor country? See lineup people begging money treatment? Welcome Trumps America. think deny now. expert all, layman's guess is:

Imagine 0 virus get 1 virus particle, let's assume doubles exponentially. takes time 20 doublings get million (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576). Presumably, scenario immune system use extra time learn virus fight it, things get control.

By time get virus breathing, already (millions? billions?) virus particles lungs anyway. rebreathing tiny subset virus shed breathing, tiny subset virus already body.

The timeline meaningfully change immune system. 1048576 doubles nearly quickly 1050000 (or whatever actual numbers are). Interesting, aware thanks! submission removed because

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* New York Jets.  I've honestly heard reason least one relative. 

Mind you, ""planning trip DisneyWorld"" least 6 years absolutely zero plans so, still stupid say. That's well good, lots people choice. company situated retailer many low income areas. letting employees customers get coronavirus, letting get shot thieves:  It’s going turn another mini campaign rally anyway. nothing legitimate this. order ""look around"" hack systems.  Russia good intentions comes US.  revenge stop bring country knees. Employees like go work, claim unemployment constructive discharge, sue wrongful termination. believe constructive discharge tested covid yet apply IMO. working conditions unsafe. what’s answer? lot problems one wants come solutions. one. Stay positive. think man without internet debating Disney open lol stay safe everyone. Stay positive. get LA county population 10 million spread 4,753 square miles. 

There 4104 covid deaths. June 1st half nursing homes. Ah pedo park. point say denied Holocaust? put words mouth. I'm saying illegal deny Israel.  facts though said they’re sending hundreds patients lol. Give source Well, viruses natural that's technically correct. quackery sense magic, auras stuff. Metaphysics studied philosophy quackery (regardless judgments actual *quality* *success* much - pseudoscientific nonsense). recently traveled CA NY (don’t crucify me, negative covid test right stayed isolated family whole time, although ill admit wasn’t best move). they’re literally enforcing anything. nobody asked single thing CA NY airport. Human trials ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 began Oxford, England, April 23, following successful tests rhesus macaque monkeys US late March.

""We hope get signal whether working middle June,"" John Bell, regius professor medicine University Oxford, told BBC's ""Today"" radio program Thursday.

This taken directly article. direct quote relation phase 1 trial April 1100 people U.K. quote phase 3 time article written phase 3 even happening. *Don't worry, comment joke lol r/ihadastroke CD-20 B cells wiped ever 6 months monoclonal antibody (Ocrevus)? mean you’re kind right also let employees go parks world take multiple people, free. Nearly anytime day go free take others, limits depending important gf used enough worth $10000 half year. went every month us, the. We’d take friends roommate, took family multiple times, it’s actually good perk like parks.

I’ve never paid go Disney park world, it’s literally completely free. yeah that’s pretty nice go park time free, don’t worry anything! lines, rushing around! Since go day go one there, I’ve never wait longer 45 min ride 1 time kid. time like wait 10-20.

It’s literally different experience go Disney free like whenever, makes like fun mall go anytime hang ride rides free time! Pfizer looks promising dont believe vaccine time soon, however believe better therapeutics, better testing tools, prevalent immunity population next months. 

We could see beginning end next March April, normal Halloween Christmas 2021. Everything said correct, arguments right?  never able achieve herd immunity within normal time frame (= vaccine available) also keeping hospitals capacity mind (which low, low even).

Also lot people die.

Herd Immunity without vaccine deadly contagious virus stupid. also policy Dutch Government. policy indeed maximum control, different lockdown. accept can't shut country down, damage would astronomical, also let virus go free, damage would astronomical too. They've accepted can't get rid virus, lockdown long term useless damaging. focus controlling virus, people infected, die, develop immunity, freedom economy open lockdown. nothing herd immunity. goal controlling virus much possible without destroying economy herd immunity achieved (preferably vaccine). isn’t required file taxes? According dashboard, check every day, cases per 100k 200 peak ~250 month ago, hospitalizations tending down, they’ve never close running ICU aren’t good here, aren’t Florida  AZ going highest per capita, hard time ""stupiding"" Florida. clearly preaching choir. 

If she’s polarizing everyone largest supporters people already support action climate change, preaching choir. case rallying them. going provide actual solution?

I actually drafted Journal Article publication outlining successful rural America climate change action. would combination carbon sequestration, wind power, solar resources intermixed crop fields. 

I also went engineering symposium research carbon sequestration rural Africa. Basically, using carbon sequestration charcoal amend soil make productive. 

I also worked organic solar panel research lab. 

I personally drive used electric car moved closer work minimize footprint. Electric lawnmower. I’m solar panels installed. 

But parents aren’t wealthy don’t connections Royalty.  Yep! Kinda topic another sub think simplifid version. buy new car 30K, drive lot get 25K. finance 35K. $10K difference paid. work 100(s)hrs pay difference gain nothing. What's called work gain material value? covid effected people dogs would probably care way more. Damn thats bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: cheating system part say! would say I’m pro-life conservative side strongly disagree. He’s prick, he’s wrong saying things. that's ENTIRE UK today sign ""friends-only"" communications policed corporation. 

&amp;#x200B;

You realize means friends reported post Facebook? replaces previous CDC Hospital Capacity dashboard. also - low levels infection experiment reopening make couple mistakes things get BAD. US can't afford making mistakes anymore... Show me. That’s article says. spent hour Toyota dealer morning... temp. taken entry. Every soul place permanently masked, including mechanics staff, one guy waiting room, dropped mask. rep signaled car ready, never pulled mask, rather long conversation right face rep. (both 3 feet me). never advised warned way--a tough &amp; risky job, hers. Poverty cause lot deaths covid. money going come help people sick everyone broke?

What correct amount deaths order shutdown city state? Get everyone wear mask indoors social distance everywhere. Ban indoor gatherings. Slowly get back near-normal transmission longer exponential. Wait ~1 year (give take) vaccine. rocket science.

You know, like almost every OECD country already (besides vaccine part). EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, etc. spent 2+ trillion (2,000 billions 2,000,000 millions) Iraq. 

What could done $2 trillion? We'll never know spending $2 trillion anything tax breaks rich people blood money defense contractors blood. Right. ‘hoped’ get signal works middle June. UK lockdown cases dropping quickly. yet convinced vaccine going available quickly people think don’t doubt integrity people behind it. all. ‘changing story’ reacting live conditions test, turned far ideal.  US military it’s country, would one largest contributors greenhouse gas emissions, like 130 countries. Maybe, maybe, they'll leave America alone maybe try again? Maybe? believe run school. people charge schools truly terrible people: district’s superintendent said current plans built assumption students staff get coronavirus, guidelines decide infections shut things down. It’s automatic.

So, guess they’ve dealt consistency educational delivery question. involving morality. thought /s obvious bucko  think death hoax, mean go around killing people. \#benched Thank you! pisses people saying, ""it's old immunocompromised people"". 7 year old asthma type 1 diabetes. risk. people think matter. Fuck them.

She catches every cold flu goes around. going back school covid-19 going on; I'll homeschool send back. I'm lucky enough option stay home worry families require 2 person income. stores typically attract dumbest lot well. breeding ground Covid-19 stricken Patriots refuse wear masks ""freedom"" make sense.  NEEDS seen people! there's idea. idk know something going give. either tryants win, MASS FINALLY GIVE TRYANTS CONTROL THEM. 


this goes dont run show. think run show also control. would online class would take lecture hall, person lab work (such science labs) work? friend PhD biomedical sciences layout it’s working fine perspective. genuinely curious, instigating. Shut downs 

Uhh really. already another shutdown order non-essential businesses last week. think second stay-at-home order completely question. depends next weeks effective second shut order is. agree pretty at. Yes, many them, family home bitching come visit, complaining things blown proportion. Oh, they're absolutely correct, comical hear one brainwashed group talk brainwashed another group is. inability see parallels sad hilarious. might bit myth told Americans make feel better high drug *Conclusions.* Higher prescription drug spending United States disproportionately privilege domestic innovation, many countries drug price regulation significant contributors pharmaceutical told mouthpiece China? Forgive me, dont give shit garbage reported organization.

Like said slightly worse flu. Whatever 99% survival rate? ""swear"" actually understand true. 
Weekends reported less, yes numbers less week last week, still broke ""weekend records"" 


Although, still agree matter time need sharpy. keep lid-off stand-by! 3.2 million people 

493 covid deaths. 

Screw alarmists. tried look figure heck debt to, found 24tril

Is America's debt debt ppl? whole time thought borrowed money country (which honestly sounded character.) would make lot sense good example education system. never 'over', virus going away. threatments definitely improve Christmas, quite likely. Phase 1 already started. referencing getting signal efficacy June way could start approval process September. 

They moved trials, keep pushing back time line, stalling start trials US weird reason. STarting politicians? dont ask. go customer service way out. Ahhh, fruit/vegetable Nazi station, good them. grandma 90 years old. one thing months without seeing friends family-- many grandkids fly see her, dropping wave window possible.

But years... might dead years. finding distressing. blame her. [Every year US Military spends money air conditioning troops middle east yearly NASA think 190 cases day. wish day U.S 190 cases, seems far away point. UK late well done lying distorting facts yet? Reading posts rather embarrassing. US reached peak yet terms infections journey peak much slower - check every country. Combine delay deaths doubt half way yet He's scheduled Lead (CNN) time Coronavirus briefing, one expert asked podium Trump. Except China. spring registered 21 million less cell phone users Coronavirus, wonder happened? 🤔🤔 honestly frustrates hell huge Greitens fan. cut funding bunch things cost job go fuck himself. sent counterfeit PPE Boston - fuck Patriots. work hotel housekeeper barley one wears mask besides us employees. super packed weekend, tiny hallways full family's going pool, masks site. Also absolutely time properly sanitize rooms, try get yelled saying I'm going slow. live illinois people seem think since okay over. I've already come terms job safe me, need money really do. advice avoid hotels haha people think they're spreading it. Teenagers care. Giant parties still happening daily basis. Everyone seems accepted they'll get eventually. Yeah find absolut scary.

I seen Video it. Unfortunately subtitles. Pictures even impact.

Struggled post already problems german articles post. interesting often well covered wanted share sub.

His wife also better, look says today well, love crushed heart eyes offers ""go bed rest couch make meal"" destroyed life clear Future behaviour looks tell text catch. 

Sorry bleeding eyes, swear improve english. simple fact could vector disease.

For example, STD asymptomatic, could dangerous others catch it...it would responsibility tell partners could risk. 

With Covid, might get deadly ill, potential carrier, prevent spread others. simple. honestly really need doughnuts lol Sad. totally preventable. link it. couple paragraphs says talking 1100 people got vaccine trial April. phase 1 trial. 1100 people phase 3 trial number. 

That direct quote specifically talking phase 1 trial took place April 1100 people U.K. Isn’t Florida like biggest hotspot world right now? it’s STILL vacation destination. Absolutely ludicrous would interested work home post-pandemic. see becoming popular cost saving companies...

...but could also see pushback it, whole lot people know who’s entire social lives/culture revolves around working location.

But maybe people expand social/culture circles outside work. That’s big unknown. actually cancelled prime making effort wait days see still want thing think want search websites decide go it. realized since got prime 3 yrs ago, bought lot stuff already pay prime. save money tease amazon making think I’m going buy lol. disagreement there.  ""We live it"" is, believe, next step. Depends prisoners speak of. multiple types. Add Chicago list. next destination federal forces. Everyone Home Depot needs wear mask.It's simple! Asian supermarkets.

National chains 99 Ranch H Mart requiring masks since mid-March, month half Costco. must be? live European part Russia even 40 C ok wear mask. Never used 2h tho, maybe much adds up. data FHM seem include deaths city districts Stockholm region redirects FHM stats. Maybe report somewhere. included daily excel-file. another comment claim psychiatrist treating transgender patients, elsewhere claim ER physician less three months later. it, then? lol again, great argument. None show reality counties worst now. Media allowed film critically ill patients lying hours ER, patients beds corridors, queue ambulances patients waiting get in, certainly conditions hastily put together surge ICU-wards properly equipped.

Video reality would proof patient families would sue. staff allowed speak media, threat fired. Plenty big businesses pay taxes got corona money. No. point regardless intention article, articles imply stretch years encourage people adopt attitude “guess it. give up.” biggest Johnson fan actually giving people goal “let’s work together return normal point” actually buys people collective action. 

Also, running sort headlines disingenuous. Yeah vaccine approved September doesn’t mean pandemic automatically over. mean things gradually improve. COVID-19 around long time, also stuff like Polio/H1N1/other deadly flus. society learned sort accept it. treatments improve, vaccines slowly rolled out, (yes) herd resistance kicks in, see people largely returning normal.

Edit: also disingenuous fallacy long COVID-19 exists people wearing masks social distancing inaccurate. Basically I’m saying agree article headline people running in. context Delhi population 18 million. works well, still deal Biggie Principle? brb, calling jpow! weak, amazing. ""Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times."" We're tale end cycle. Making couple minor adjustments keep people safe nothing freedom opinion. people feel freedom stake here? plan going home staying thanksgiving New Year’s longer since work remotely. plan bringing meals 8 hour drive stop gas. parents don’t leave house get groceries delivered. dad works home mom retired able minimal risk. certainly would going fly take public transport. fear airlines bus companies going ignore recommendations government remove liability pack passengers like sardines again. rent sure seemed grow normal rate re-signed June... encourage call help us understand seeing. seems like hearing truth get dismissive mad. actual points I'd love discuss you, somehow doubt do. issue phase 3 trials UK level infection dropping rapidly trials due start. Therefore, pointed themselves, could sure vaccinated subjects didn’t get c19 vaccine works weren’t exposed virus. would make trial results unreliable. personally unsure NFL play, multi-billion dollar institution resources test, isolate prevent spread small-town high school Kentucky. already investing tons money daily testing players owners negotiating safety measures. Even then, might fail, I’ll bet it’ll lot safer small town football Trump Country. “fuck tyranny.” wonder Karen’s city hall meeting still going off. yeah dumbest goal time

like wanting fuck death coherent motivation   September 2021 best. That's lockdowns idiotic thing do. right. Sooorry. tRUmp mob crony, right? He's right, know *me* protect *them*?

In general, I’d say people put health needs first thinking others, used regarded bad, changed now? Nope that's it, that's solution, sure got me! Unlimited quantitative easing! understand ""unlimited"" means?? AZ hospitalization numbers going several days now. number reported deaths today death certificate matching. aren’t far fetched. Maybe countries certainly America exactly proposing of? done almost anyone else cause bring awareness. I'm sure goes university study something related involvement cause.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh misunderstood, old guys fuck. probably get re-elected old shit, lie lie denied reflect lie lie. nowhere near good enough unenforceable. Basically BS sound like they’re something. Start fining people wearing masks, make sting, least $150+. That's provided Texas play death numbers. basically like attacked wasps. higher number wasps stings you, higher chances complications. Someone allergic still die one sting though. fellow THD associate, know mean, I've heard mention enforcement workers. store stopped tracking occupancy count month ago, week ago, higher ups said ""just call us someone wearing mask pissy it"". Thankfully, people city ball mask-wise, always outliers. response tough shit. fucking pandemic nothing individually wish important health everyone. people fucking weak pathetic, lacking sort discipline all. CFR basis, SARS scary. COVID killed many Americans (~30-50x?) don’t really seem responding.

Seems like schools reopening, we’ll get commumity spread deaths lingering on. kids fine. guy tried cross lane without signaling honked let know there, got upset. next stoplight proceeded yelled speeding (I wasn't) lane (I wasn't). proceeded spit car me. Thing right spit passenger window, course hit least. still called cops cause shit?

Lesson think people spit people argument much logical sense begin idea even means. 

They Phase 3 data show worked. refusing discuss getting handouts refusing show data.


Meaning probably failed. play Planet Coaster instead won’t hold breath giving strong reasoning it’s 1 million day. 

Good platitudes grandstanding though. sure showed smart are.

As asserting correct proof needed. 

It’s 1 million. might be. could be. it’s yet be. Yeah maybe. When?

Point herd immunity take years. Plural. Maybe 4. definitely less 1. I'll put way. can't teach people wont teach themselves. conservatives know real life either old consuming Fox news like hydrocodone Midwest. Unwilling read reflect upon anything state basic egocentric talking points seen within conservative rhetoric--me me. Or, god forbid worst, religious zealot who's checklist candidate white, male, says religious. BullShitReasonToVoteForSomeone == (1, 1, 1) disp('Omg he's best canidate!!!') end. zero interests reading articles, looking laws asking pertain them, even trying recognize much damage cause sheer level disregard others. news station, church, militant gun group inform rights taken away. Even law actually beneficial socioeconomic status may even considered aspect freer basis currently have. Tired understatement, repulsed sickened notion believe Americans content nothing basis constitution. Even zero clue content constitution past second. Everything obscured blur never discussed. Maybe karma housing market 👀 Oh shit show sure. Especially hard hit state like Florida. erode trust further. Open source always make sense. There's something many cooks kitchen.

And absolutely want everyone starting focus trains thought once, real risk open source. leads real risk major dead ends. They're annoying. Honestly junk mail broken system. 95% mail wife gets advertisement something Keep safe. He’ll get it. Economy shitter actually. two different things type tracking/reporting Disney World banking on. Yes know flaws identification, tracking, reporting. post something nihilistic? Basically everyone already it. Who’s left infect solution? oh no... honestly awful, true mean unless UK government got sneak peak Phase 3 data way know worked.

If Phase 3 UK showed efficacy UK government knew would going gang busters get ready go.


That happening. fact proposed timeline keeps getting pushed back. math stats. works. things talking March may?  Thank you. really appreciate people cite credible sources. finished yet but, super surprised findings. direct result president’s failure lead nation health crisis. least Disney corporate shut down. least care employees. could give bleep people work go Disney parks. We’re middle pandemic dude don’t care money enough mess vaccine data hahahahahahaha tf Greta get 90,000 pounds? Bet worked real hard it. guy straight go fuck Accounting different trial phases overthinking anything. Yeah, right might well let blow though entire population, absolutely nothing else done. Problem solved! Actually governor said would, started implementing, policy stop cars based New York license plates, go door-to-door looking New Yorkers. That's big no-no. I'm SHOCKED! ^that ^we ^are ^only ^paying ^2x ^and ^not ^way ^more. CDC reports tomorrow's weather across US could include rain, sunshine, snow, depending location. Nah lamas alpacas spit threatened mother father never received stimulus check behaviour exactly? elaborate please... Vote life depended it. Seriously, people need see what's happening. People losing perspective since see actions causing. Glad got arrested spitting business telling wear mask unless employee telling prior entering. mean else going do, shoot virus?

My opinion solution better education. Teach:

* critical thinking skills
* avoid confirmation bias
* seeking cognitive dissonance achieve complete picture
* logical fallacies identify them
* difference news editorial
* always ask 5 ""W's"" what/when/where/who/why

OR maybe even newer reports, keep talking lots manufactured September (manufactured, approved, course)? Yes. Everyone exact fear.

Instead seeing incorrect chance learn become correct, instead see personal failure attack themselves. wrong makes less, brain avoids costs, even twisting reality head, quite sad. me, seems successful countries far this:

1. Brought infections level [contact keep expanded testing capacity parallel

2. Eased restrictions kept infections contact tracing isolation local measures needed

Many US states seem tried (2) really half-assed (1) get infections nearly far enough. facts. friends family doctors nurses working frontlines. research uninformed. Congress increase budget likely guy literally give shit kids die suffer life long health issues. care kids infect die.

Oh woe I'll get 99% survival rate flu whatever do? agree, pretty sad think wearing mask anything. fun living fear laugh sheeple. - We’re talking round Earth, Champ, discovered around 5th century BCE. We’re talking revolving around sun. Incorrect again. 

- problem ENTIRE argument say “a people THINK...”. completely dismiss part statement, “people think, thanks ever increasing amount evidence saying it’s good idea”. It’s opinion. people didn’t throw crazy idea wearing masks. There’s evidence really bizarre reason completely ignore. yes, make blanket statement blatantly choosing ignore science. make choice ever increasing amount data supports it, ignore all. choose wear selfish reasons. 

I don’t understand last statements reason push masks poor ol’ we’re scared. Again, make bold absurd statements. telling put mask SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SAYS GOOD IDEA! 

Stop ignoring science, evidence, facts. Conservatives love calling left “snowflakes” damn, sure getting feelings involved topic based upon science, evidence, facts.

If degree requires sort hands work, going useless zoom classes.

Random example, friend training become entomologist. study insects different controlled lab conditions online without going lab? Basically impossible.

If something computer programming maybe, trade-related non-technical skills can't learned without person human interaction. example, instead intervening markets, allow companies go bankrupt start over. Let consequences risk taking.

Imagine regret self-blame come destroying body. ""If stayed home. put mask."" Even nothing wrong, brain can't help going there. 

What way turn happy life miserable one. Found one. Probably best. Even travelers abide (or, likely, discouraged visiting first place) effect. Every infection prevented takes many chain. cut trees, wear high heels

I wish I'd girlie, like dear Papa Hell yeah! Know rights! telling people politicians listen scientists. That's best thing right now. 

Climate scientists offer plenty actions right now. Climate scientists figured make people politicians take enough notice. Sinatra Gupta, perhaps would wise spend researching spewing dangerous talking points ridiculuos. like soft spoken ""seems sensible"" meaning never says anything straight, reads whatever says flip flops everything.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah kinda assumed. That's usually one people go for, vague applied everything life. 

While agree limits expression, already ruled 1st amendment can't supercede safety others. I'm glad actually picked one stand behind. marginally better argument nothing. Hey welcome bassackwards state! day came called office spoke staff 45 min. encourage same. dumbass old lady talked said kids 100% safe course arent. Fuck man, fuck views, fuck staff, fuck mother fucking mama He’s full shit.. Aha, see paying attention news Chongqing. don’t know, 1964 seemed go ok. news? Non-stop hysteria virus... news people worried? scenario employees worried? hysteria-driving ""news"" coverage.

At end day take calculated risks. Every time get car drive, taking calculated risk.

If dangerous, make choice. Stay home necessary. 

Economy needs move without fearful. Think things bad virus? Try adding widespread poverty failed economy. 

Everything cost/benefit consider.

There perfect solution. Can't isolate everyone indefinitely think resources survive magically produce themselves. Forced work lose home eat.

You'll likely get family sick.

If requires hospital stay, debt could likely make lose home anyways.

And can't leave job find better/safer one, lose health insurance. get sick definitely fucked.

Long term need better social programs benefit average person. Short term *could have* handled pandemic better avoid this... ship sailed. fast millions? Bio Hitman Lol, scared people already assuming everything 100% safe lockdown over, get false sense security wearing mask... Great think Richmond highest masked population lowest case count lower mainland fluke

No kidding, people wearing masks SkyTrain January. shit ton robbed government less week ago. IDGAF cruel. Karen likely 5lb Chihuahua named Precious that's poorly trained bitey. Haha nice try ain’t falling shit Mr. Lahey Covid-19 virus started spread, pretty certain wouldn’t huge, devastating impact terms mortality, coronaviruses circulating.

This lady epidemiologist, thinks similar pathogens circulating, automatically means people somewhat immune? mean, wrong entirely, nuanced publics understanding, pretty incorrect say article going public. mean impression H1N1 viruses non-existent 1918 pandemic? similar SARS1 9% kill rate?

Theres lot virology infectious disease general stupid 'herd immunity' trope keeps getting passed around. huge list things vaccinate herd immunity really exist without vaccines. Show data [soaring covid hospitalization combined stories hospitals getting overwhelmed refrigerator trucks overwhelmed morgues

- FOX links possible folks lolz)

Obviously there's people hospitals usual, obviously many people dying. ain't covid, heck it? It’s fun get sick important use words study. ""results suggest information dissemination COVID-19, causes individual adoption handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, effective strategy mitigate delay epidemic."" 

People seem resist use wording like COVID-19 stopped. need understand delay mitigate resources handle everyone require respiratory assistance.  Fair enough. yes, caused pizza blowjobs. Oh ok. Thanks posting. symptoms epididymitis months ago along slight stomach ache around time. probably get tested soon. see fly window I'd say yeah, idiot spat seat. would've laughed face kinda got caught moment, nobody ever spat day Yes, people go beach never go restaurants bars shopping hotels swim, guess. Well increased days 6 me. Granted different parks may different rules well since worked Disney World. Also depends position in, managers get days regular cast members. also mentioned additional tickets black days them. Also act like altruistic thing. costs nothing let people park spend money park. hard say systematic treatment approaches been. spoke brother, MD Las Vegas, practice treated 50 patients Covid-19. got well none required hospitalization. said anything special, mention steroids anti-coagulation. they’re not. 5 mile drive today (upstate) saw 34 out-of-state plates. masks. distance. People dining outdoors. We’re going another bad outbreak. Colorado, like everywhere else developed world, testing contact tracing. Throughout April May decline case counts.

Once testing longer get results back quickly enough isolate positive people, rate spread goes significantly.  make argument protests worth spreading coronavirus people kill. say protests open Disneyland fine. makes complete hypocrite make argument protesters pack tiny area tens thousands without distancing many wearing masks spread coronavirus people Disney world distance wear masks large area sparcely populated spread coronavirus. Seriously, think it... You’re troll idiot. Neither good. Americans vacationing Canada using Alaska loophole. tell border agents merely travelling Canada Alaska promise self-isolate trip, -surprise- don’t.

Others come saying need maintenance summer home, promise self-isolate 2 weeks, -surprise- , don’t. Goes way back great grandma Winnifred Winner famous Chicken Dinner.  Wow right sociopath things I’m sitting home-office since beginning this, country stable terms daily cases (avg ~340/day) everybody seems loose minds pandemic wouldn’t exist.

Everyone expect + others company attends cramped office space without health precautions mask wearing neither social distancing (last record ~12 people small room attending meeting).

Any tips convince reconsider approach whole situation? (I’m getting exhausted explaining it’s flu taken precautions nothing terms science approach) Hint: it’s campaign rally thought king Julian situation control! They're not. glorified campaign rallies Trump's loop-holed getting prime-time national press coverage. Makes sense. 

And really want make happen. (learn language) Overblown virus wow phase 1 used three different doses, high dose gave worst side effects. middle dose effective, moreover vaccine effective producing response 45/45 patients, showing mild side effects. 

Phase 3 launched July 27 iirc, testing middle tier dose. 

It creates protein spike body, seemingly really protect catching virus - prevents turning COVID-19 disease. man, video funny, interested.

**Hyuk, demons told to** Yes no, Newsom good job following science didn’t backing needed federal government keep safe reopen forced reopening early resulted this. put people hospital.

Give billions people really bad. 

There likely vaccines this. money Oxford one. right. Anything causes coughing trigger asthma attacks. Common medications used treat asthma make patients susceptible viruses. Currently, harm caused stopping medications like inhaled corticosteroids considered dangerous staying considering asthmatics stay isolated, wear masks, etc lower risk infection. Patients stop taking meds certainly end hospital. Perhaps. probably prisons called ""club fed"". I'm also really concerned India exponential curve cases deaths. value retirement lives students shouldnt teacher. Also, cases NYC highly populated vs rest state, like comparing apples oranges. It’s relative. HCQ talked supposed ineffective [turned nobody talks I? would suggest I'd infinite wisdom refused say pledge middle school learned child legal right object... morning class P.E. teacher turned red yelled almost brain aneurism it. struck falling gym light next semester always knew karma took time one!  Mechanic. I'm thinking there's less profit make there. I'm speculating. wish best. political transformation interesting observe. believe comment wholly inaccurate. 

We saw Wuhan allmost 8 months ago, learned alot it, elected US govt officials decided fuck ""science"" try covering eyes screaming "" test, get sick"" best plan. Disney Land open too? Yeah, worked call center online mmorpg's. Also forgot mention, Miami least Winn Dixie's predominantly Hispanic(pretty much Miami) areas switched names Fresco Mas (fresh more) Spanish. said still shop even worse dirtier Hispanic cousin Sedanos. (before anyone calls racist I'm hispanic, think stores cater lower end usually dirty hell compared Publix) dont see scenario wouldnt public outcry support teachers lost retirements process keeping people safe. Again, im seeing strike permanent solution negotiating technique. think nationwide strike, would able continue school online within month. US shit job hiding numbers everyone knows hunchgut lying devil see refrigerator trucks full bodies. Vote pos office let's try everyone murdered bullshit response. God still can't even provide simple source link. I'm betting star pupil bundle cooperation growing up.

Did miss part paragraph said charged? know, actual evidence, facts, documentation put table found done wrong doing. 

Like said, hoping would provide insight aware of. would provide evidence maybe something overlooked fell outside statute limitations. least something old regurgitated tripe stand court. Oh well.  works Sweden 16 people know other. infection widespread probably want wear one, nothing else social signaling showing others respect well being. still know vaccines virus like flu vaccines efficacy limited, like vaccines get immune long time. T-cells nothing stop reinfection endemic human coronavirus, would cross-reaction expected use new, extremely infectious one?

This whole idea garbage. make sense theoretically, obviously untrue empirically. think must prepare see [temperature screening everywhere Guess what? happens every year flu. Young people get it, give elderly relatives, die. Thousands actually, US. Hundreds thousands worldwide, winter months, every year.

Every years millions people.

And yet, noone ever cared even given second thought. 

It's called life. risks, people die. Old people higher chance death time, everything. Sorry that's bullshit. schools reopen? Absolutely mean push nothing education. fact many MANY kids parents equipped handle virtual school kids essentially going lose year education. ok outraged now? Florida currently 24 deaths per 100,000 population. NY 165. That's nearly 7 times deaths per capita. Florida start catch doubt they'll ever reach NY numbers. praising NY bashing Florida gotten ridiculous that's coming liberal CT.  Unfortunately found original Press release - try get tomorrow via mail. Ah, Vietnam Korean War called want read American history.  feel like guy calls police someone spit vehicle, vehicle, real party popper! Refused self quarantine alert local authorities leaving home.

Too many Karen's give shit act right. got ankle bracelet, authorities know leaves home.


Boo hoo. thought funny name real! You’re joking right? add klan meetings? Lol yeah 400,000,001 new record high Indeed. don’t think people wrap head around much money people have. I’m sorry, essentially gods. Thank you! Journalists need start quoting entire paragraphs like instead picking bits pieces almost sound like sentences. must needed lie typing up. May blessed selfless work. Yeah read as:

“The market lower-end apartments competitive demand high-end apartments reduces.” Luxury apartments sit vacant. Lower middle class apartments continue rise cost. nice digestible video explaining government debit: context linear means pace time. Super linear would mean pace increasing. Example - linear- every 1 day, 1 new infection. Super linear = 1 day = 1.1 infections, 2nd day 1.2 infections, 3rd day 1.3.... problem Dallas suburbs teachers so's school seem ""get it"". None complained even batted eye district decided MAKE TEACHERS VIRTUAL ACTUAL CLASSROOM. Oh yeah, ""meet teacher night"" game on. end year, dummies even gathered technology teachers risked lives distribute go massive coughing smoking sneezing stream parents driving re-pickup tech.

A lot Trump supporting teachers think hoax too. honestly defies logic. U.S this, put money saved coronavirus research. course happen. Yea, deaths lag see happens. mean, I’m wishing anyone death correlation referencing isn’t yet. Also East West coast different strains present. believe east coast one deadly. wrong that, don’t quote me. want know how, without reading entire rambling rant American taxpayer paying remdesivir twice—once via original federal grants supported drug’s development, point care.

This saying ratepayers paying twice per dose

also !RemindMe 106 days good point concept actually applied, nobody would spend amount money tuition get college degree outside pursuing career medical profession. sounds bad point long it’s NY levels still hope. India needs it. slow steady growth rate concerning. sobering realize 1/3 American population are... decent people, all. Remember Clinton actually paying deficit? 12 years Reagan/Bush went massive spending spree. Trump briefing probably 

""China-flu, virus. say is- I've told I've done tremendous job. Tremendous. Far better anyone could believe. hear 'rising infections, deaths', that's say. lamestream media. I'll tell this- FAKE news! Right started, CHINA virus, said everyone 'America beat this', that's CNN. say number us. no, lie, believe me. closed borders day one, China, origin Wuhan virus. cos I'm smart, extremely scientific. That's people think, think- say opened country up. good thing, good thing. Tremendous actually. mean is- I'm saying safe go back work, go back knowing made safe."" nean everyones phone already track. 

Its funny people use facebook smartphones think Bill Gates wants mictochip thrm tracking. people voluntarily give info already actually difficult compare death tolls across countries there's global standard counts COVID death. example, UK counting deaths anyone [has tested since died, cutoff Even UK government deaths published dashboard COVID deaths. Needs another zero. laws regulations passed her? source pollution ended specifically her?

NONE. 

She's glorified cheerleader nothing more. bank accounts released good phase 1 data.

It doesnt prove efficacy.

If suddenly talking 2 doses probably means phase 3 failed.

It would take new trials 2 dose regiment would take months even start months run.

Their recent comments continue appear way set announcing phase 3 failure. Still see America also preparing required hardware administer vaccine it'll awhile Americans welcome anywhere developed world. No. people believe chance left heard. allies decided that, specific instance, potential gains outweigh potential costs.

There many warning signs movement scale never allowed happen wait. peace-time president ever sent unmarked, federal officers cities take protestors. never happened. Yet administration cheered applauded ever dwindling base hateful people. Africa low foreign travel mostly low population density read American history 

If look recent post history see PhD American history.

Poor boys getting blowed reason Korea Vietnam nothing build economic boom overall prosperity (for whites, least) mid-20th century America. due hard work, sacrifice, death generation prior Boomers. Glad delivered, internet friend good taste TV! That's alligator   knew getting into.  need experienced epidemiologist getting way stable genius focused freedom. Get program people. left Fauci, might something crazy like make testing available. Compensation match risk, extent. Risk reduces supply workers willing work job. someone invented new technology made coal mining risk free job could home, pay coal miners would also go down, due increase supply Nope thank fucking god mobility report google shows sweden less mobile covid. working waaay home - 58% go less.

sweden social distance per definition. prober response would way easier. economy equaly fucked wont let come countries.

and live parks now. +369% increase parks etc. wtf possible. sweden sitting trees now? angry elf 😂🤣 post 2 days ago really got going. don’t like understand Dollar Store employee’s shouldn’t responsible enforcing rules demonstrably violent end self evidently ignorant/selfish subset people make large part anti-mask crowed.

Without backing state can’t even call help. wow, places corona longer major threat wear masks less. fucking crazy. Maybe think summer Covid better Winter Covid  real study talks specifically outcome there's correlation. recommend figure 2 can't read would rather vote actually think information.
 Yeah, little weird someone open critical door suddenly explode, shortly someone tells go gets shot randomly right someone tells piece critical information suddenly gets car accident little someone *sells coffee* gets blown up.

Even barista died important main characters anymore. *The barista*! story. CDC obstructing release data age breakdown, etc. administration wanted HHS handle. simply ‘Trump wants restrict testing data,’ portrayed. blame doubting. they're floating cities nuclear power plant airport. price tag makes sense. think damn many. apologies assume American, American people addressing original post. cannot speak countries. 

Enjoy break! certainly earned it. Delhi curve flattened quite considerably actually, around 2/3rds peak lends credibility research - still serious doubts related specificity test selection bias data live OC/LA border (OC side unfortunately) fucking god people morons county.

&lt;20-30% wear masks, schools opening mask requirements LA couple blocks away says schools online...

Hey OC WAKE FUCK See also, Octavia Butler's ""Parable"" books. 13 days believe since 3m 4m. know, think you’re right, it’s cool though buddy gave sharpie that’s easy fix.  Thank responsible sane adult. WENT GET TESTED. GAVE INFO. 👏👏👏👏 hard? wanted write exact thought. Bro, relying single-center retrospective study big RCT terminated due negative effects literally selling snake oil. Oh hey 'murican! know masks protect Bill Gates, 5G, deep state vaccines? 


(They 'Murican likely stupid realise read far along.)


Seriously, get head ass wear mask. Dont know downvoted, loved comment. done that. fun contact old sex partner give news get tested. Still, adult thing do. long term think correct strategy treat people adults. think people Sweden would mind sharing information whether Covid-19 think lot people would think encouraged share information. could also hospitals changed criteria admission. know AZ first state implement 'crisis care' standards.

This 'triage' could produce drop hospitalizations witnessing. mean less people getting critically ill, means less people admitted.

Question: person dies Covid home, counted 'official' numbers? squash court set outdoors. Many squash courts south asia open air.

A pool needed train one either reserve time training swim river? Walt Disney wouldn’t wanted Close Diseasny Land really fair comparison. India way ahead countries terms population density. insane amount people living top other. can't even keep control cities like Phoenix Tuscon like suburbs compared populated cities world. Haha.. yeah, it’s discussed. I’ve afraid try. you’re right many people seeing right anyway. actually hadn’t thought that. conflate two, one things actually important, definitely enough people willing stick necks it...would protesting think so?

It's interesting see people defend grossest aspects capitalism suits needs, like apparently brain, going Disneyland resisting violent, sadistic poilce force. 

You know wants believe that??? congressman crying saving *the economy* point healthy economy people live happily, freely, without targeted based colour skin. economy would fine, fucking morons charge botched response. Every country planet fucking national/federal level response, Trump administration said hoax, said, every man themselves! thank fucking shit show. leg stand criticizing people.

It's like stuck strange loop, reciting bullshit hear Fox News big business interests (like Disney, multi-billion dollar company, reason can't let single season amusement park money go by)...it's laughable, stupid, sad once. benefits people believing people protesting safety well being, okay take trip Disneyland too??? Who??? *Disney*...that's right, makes sense. like business willing make argument, open too, since people protesting all. even better mega corporations, can't open, *no one* allowed voice dissent. strangely fucked dynamic is. Convenient richest us.

Seriously though, think it. Americans slightest input regarding tax dollars spent. may trending upward too, really idea.

But please wear masks? waiting it😂😂 someone knocked right ass dragged store. I’m really getting tired piece shit people. need good old ass kicking. ......what? gave us results earlier phases one dose triggered immune response 91% people. Two doses brought 100%. makes sense continue two doses determine exact dosage needed. Yes, right asshole infect others, snowflake. Ah, ok. Yes, makes sense. 

The spread FL happened fast solid contact tracing nearly impossible. tests (like NBA athletes) come back day, come back nearly two weeks later (my brother-in-law... negative. Big deal. Two weeks lifetime here). 

Thanks clarifying. CEO real estate developer longtime donor republican politicians. coincidences here.  Lol considering NY 40k deaths, really something joke soon wonder Olympic event tickets bought non-refundable... google search says 3700 people die day auto accidents. matter age health least case custodians Disneyland California option refuse go back. girlfriend custodian told would calling people depending seniority, worker want return work request stay furlough. custodians union could option.

I heard Disneyland trying reopen though, tried reopen anniversary request denied. Delhi slowed quite considerably actually, around 2/3rds peak lends credibility research - still serious doubts related specificity test selection bias data. closing schools, sympathy teachers hanging beach. emphasizing modeling updates keeping social contacts 60% normal far important mask mandate. Mask mandates help course places physical distancing tricky encounter lot strangers whose physical social network would normally intersect e.g. grocery stores, public transit, retail etc . recent outbreak caused private parties way enforce mask restrictions, people going follow them. People going limit many people meet real life while, sucks. federal government authority lockdown anything. You’re asking states lockdown, states don’t money financially support people said lockdown. DUUUUVALLLL!

-Jason Mendoza accurate enough large numbers draw statistical conclusions. less accurate individual level. mother could ask insane times. believe debit card default. specifically go change direct deposit. see NHS paramedic UK translator phone app day? Basically Android app voice text spoke could read phone. feel like installed. agree would use app like that? I'm looking iPhone versions app (it called Google Live Translate). hearing issues - looking ways help. agreed me. 

they scrapped effective dose, going middle dose - caused 100% incidence side effects higher rate fever COVID itself.

It's going get approved numbers like that. vaccine ever has. Nothing even close, fact. drinking cup water one hand! nutjob. COVID would appalling CFR absent huge critical care resources thrown it.

For matter, SARS-1, one's older nastier brother, mention 9% CFR medical care. readily human-to-human transmissible, stealthy it. idea ""a Christian company"" already weird fuck, btw. *It Jokes them, 100 years they'll dead Logical basis personal incentive completely different things blank shell account run business account. That's work. 

I also personal account log fuck Facebook. Hilarious. suggest using completely bounds death rate like 10% countries inability adequately test track cases?

Any statistician, predictive modeler would laugh suggestion.

Estimations always used predictive modeling account things official statistics incapable capturing. known 'metric' work US  13 day exact. 

So theoretically August 3 five million. August 16, hit six million. August 29, cross seven million. three million month possible things same. Schools back + Labor Day +no mask = yeah I'd say that's possible number. changed it, notice typo fucking gold making hassle apply business exemption would dissuade lot people. Make apply EIN would big enough hassle cut leisure travel. point healthy young people don’t care cared everything around odds killing them, they’d never leave house.

I'm Scottish - healthy young people country care. American thing. Protein timing generally bro-science. Get plenty good sleep fine. [more ""we never tried hard enough."" got it. Keep rooting death suffering! fact amusement parks even open right appalling don’t think it’s science need convince people. use science/reports/polls “prove” whatever want. 

What people actually need learn empathy, don’t protect species planet, you’re hurting yourself. Guh Heeyuck! ROFL banned people walking around drink hand day wearing mask claiming drinking questioned. exactly expect people would go Disney pandemic do. Yup always thought south Florida started Jupiter, like palm beach county. North Jupiter like pt St Lucie Vero beach called Treasure coast recall sigh, USA setting tons new records discussion, yes, many countries followed 'strict measure' route totalitarian. mean US EU states force much stricter measures were.

On hand, remember Germany characteristically lax first wave, Bavarians even open-air mass gatherings must've close height Italian chaos. boarded people like Chinese they'd better results, sure (not condoning, course). clear picture Austria.

That countries win tend isolated goes show necessarily good people measures already taken play. China means isolated small, due sheer totalitarian force. enhances original argument. Facebook got irrelevant circles bot autoresponder getting friend requests often, people even pissed ""refused friendship"" even thought ""friends"" private one anyway. glad shitshow over, hope best everyone circles stop depending too! Sinovac began testing Brazil too, closed deal São Paulo State Butantan Institute mass produce vaccine ready.  literally customer service experience. deal sort stuff time. Now, happens masks, instead single error meal, getting upgrade, able use expired coupon. Lol great life America dispensable? 

We ruled free market sees us numbers balance sheet. people. So, stop counting? saw posts case counts every day. Now, dig find anything. anyone know current new case rate US? Last saw around 70k new per day. Discusting disney this. likely mean doesn’t have. They’re two different things. get infected, could happen, you’ll likely spread virus everywhere go mask doesn’t work.

And listening, beginning. I’m still listening now, know you’re wrong  internet must true... agree that. I’m sure find people border control. know Maine looking license plates telling people NY plates isolate 14 days, early this. sure went helps, UK, seen spike packed beaches, BLM protests Statuephillic counter BLM protests. seems like outdoor transmission difficult Sars-Cov-2  Everything happens reason.

Punch face. Remind everything happens reason upset. proof kind immunity T-cells may provide. Antibodies first best option, evidence looking great.

[Another story doctor testing positive 3 months getting infected first time. totally lol ways, it’s opposite 9/11, too. 9/11 brought nation together. ambiguous warnings 9/11, nothing obvious like coronavirus. obvious Bad Guys 9/11 Weren’t Us.

We told go shopping go back normal (for part) 9/11. things people wanted do. 

This time, we’re asked things DON’T want do. There’s clear bad guy. see countries handled better have.

9/11 wasn’t ongoing thing, least weren’t military. Three months 9/11, wasn’t really anything average American civilian could make things worse, least without specific intent so. 13 times higher mid April. Definitely reflective testing situation since then. that's upper bound missed cases April, missed cases much lower percentage now. IFR within range 1% spread broadly across age demographics still fairly robust finding likelier accurate indicator level extra cases highly specific set circumstances March April. That's smart put away cheques! good move man!!!

I genuinely wish best friend, help all, please let know. I'm way NZ, happy whatever help. feel guys much. sucks, hard. also hope mum (mom?) ok. Big internet hugs.

Flick message ya ever need rant rando stranger :) I'm happy rant chat sounding board! think funny everyone left CONSTANTLY ragging Trump sooner. know full well came day 1 (and still solid idea actually got here) said wear mask, would opposite. supporters would wearing them, haters wouldn't, spite him. Putin would never put down. NY/NJ folks going vacation now, kind moron would travel hot spot pandemic?
 
I feel bad tourist destinations. Less business overall tourists get, let's say they're gonna cream crop. Buy boat.

Edit: also supply chain swap border transport commodities. Zero reason can't staging area something like that.   OH NO! I'm sorry, devastating. Selfishness stupidity people incomprehensible be. Just... Why?

Good vibes sent ways found guy Nextdoor stomach site ignore Karens It’s always good skeptical. 
CDC study “excess deaths” guess proper term non covid deaths secondary effect  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* reflects situation mid April. Testing much lower then. unlikely we're capturing 10% cases lately that's many catching then. real prospect ""herd immunity"" would likely take far deaths that, even chances evenly spread level low (ie US reach 60 70% infected, chances loads states communities still vulnerable.) probably means nothing vaccine.

There’s small chance means would need boosters regular intervals future.

There’s small chance could mean vaccines won’t work hope. long citizens “bad” ok eyes. hear it’s protesters abducted. remember “the guy radio said people looters media call protestors b/c media side.” rationalize secret police abducting looters streets that’s ok. Winn-Dixie issue every person like nephew 100 really need money.

50% making unemployed employed. It’s “one hundred.” 

I get people’s financial safeguards completely ripped away, it’s bit stretch assume almost majority raking prior. happy got there’s? Sure.

Does sting, especially essential workers making change? Yes. That’s path infection, one perfect. breathability one it’s good enough. You’re part problem, solution. get frustrated people seem think this
is happening September October. Good story UK’s Channel 4 linked interview Sarah Gilbert Oxford. one Oxford/Astrazeneca saying September/October. saying December/January earliest. Hell wife still paying ~~mortgage~~ student loans we’re considering immigrating Canada New Zealand. nuts man Ok...Ok...for second thought full experiment actual virus. sounds lot cooler effective. Wonder valuable info got really far tell, New York method shocking number people die COVID lots others flee state = ""save lives stem spread"" virus run course meaningful % population. southern states MUCH better job, orders magnitude. even close. even *almost* think causality think is. there's death cult begins ends NE USA.

In reality, blame anyone New York northeast. virus without vaccine places densely populated. virus runs community seems run course. happening (or happened) rest country. don’t know. I’ve never bot tell before. Guess I’ll keep trying? According Reddit liberals protesting shoulder shoulder tens thousands people, many wearing masks, perfectly fine spread coronavirus. everyone going sparsely populated Disney world social distancing everyone wear mask going get coronavirus. Reddit hivemind retarded. What's point even RNC? mean, snowballs chance hell orange monkey wins fall. Anybody going Disney World cure depression global pandemic maybe, mayyybe depression. Maybe different different people, usually going huge crowded busy place number one depressive's agenda. selfish people trying make excuses make feel less irresponsible. really people highest levels clearance review release classified information vital things like this. course, also reasonable system review decisions. There’s something foundational “national interest”, “so constitution function intended”. Maybe like “information needs available voters make informed votes” give one person inside let infect gang would never able complete phase 3 testing without funding cases. apologize, think misunderstood comment. Churches corporations received money didn’t need, that’s secret surprise. I'm glad whole thing get back normal Honestly mine meant throwaway comment, confess reading article. said 2002 long time ago. know much access investigation given, maybe enough. also know. People already, chance. Hmmm. keep hearing symptomatic not, testing *wait time* get tested 2 weeks Florida Dept Health Pasco. tell him, gurgle 69. That’s actually true. successful vaccines coronaviruses. ones infect humans, never pressing enough warrant funding needed. smart. Wonder find watch ended. friends anyone? Yeah, wish way one. cut friends list 3/4, still look way :( They're worst group human beings, GENERALLY. good, learn us TV dramas. Idiots easy conquer.  It’s businesses much people listening. May find peace unless population stops dropping see travel grow again. it'll LONG recovery tho, companies live thru I'll poll people Reddit hoping someone smart chime in. masks look close mask pictured (has valve small rubber membrane inside) masks spot disposable cloth pieces insert pocket inside, valve another layer cloth. enough ensure I'm jerk putting others risk?  checked worldometers, Miami 80K plus cases. unreal. Lets send kids school! Thanksgiving Christmas going disasters. Miss one holiday season keep family safe, ton people can't even manage that. close SARS one cases dropped funding stopped. probably would found successful one it. always heard early Summer 2021 vaccine found tested thoroughly. would take another year mass produce inoculate nearly 8 billion people, thus making Summer 2022 time things could go back normal. one read Lingering Lingerie least twice? fun lifelong health problems you’ll acquire, stupid! :) Lol 

Let guess, think someday you’ll super rich too, fuck socialist poor people! Idk yeah think. Start again. Nothing sure besides know many tests made many positive.

Never occured important thing could handled like school project 5th graders... Tbh think even managed better. rookie mistake. clock's ticking', count hours Even ironically, Doyle worked ""Rosie Riveter"" two weeks war. quit avid cellist, feared would injure hands machine accident (she apparently discovered woman replacing mangled hand stamping machine). 185 week total U.S? 50% Well political experience made America great again. I’m sure excellent infectious disease expert.

/s shocked hit million many months ago. There’s thing freedom speech principle allow people spread lies kill thousands

This isn’t standard anyone trying meet. It’s disingenuous argument. one certain lies doesn’t actually harm people. could sure could act need take step back precise definitions realize you’re choosing death

You need step take position seriously. it’s matter life death precise careful. Otherwise you’re hiding behind crisis likely make bunch bad decisions advocate bad solutions. PANDEMIC.

Facebook isn’t public health agency. don’t want Facebook deciding, pandemic especially, information access to. better ways address censorship, it’s immediately obvious. That’s sort thing get don’t want precise. get carelessness consequences worse problem you’re trying solve first place. still believe Facebook social media companies able ban whoever want, remedy people leaving platform disagree. especially pandemic able ban disinformation could kill thousands.

Facebook this, doesn’t mean it’s freedom speech doesn’t mean it’s good solution. It’s solution little imagination demonstrably disastrous. There’s lot value free speech goes beyond individuals ability say whatever want. fosters culture transparency one, leads greater trust accountability. 

Right literally living disaster political polarization wrought. large part sense polarization validated efforts censor.

Gotta real dumb throw  factor US almost doubled testing since June basically one got tested early stages. yeah good. Close Thanksgiving? summer already over? guess besides back school Halloween, retail calendar goes fast.

Wear surgical mask n95 valve protect everyone else. 🖖😷 sounds like excellent idea, really. solve one problem another, divert police funds COVID response. basically Game Thrones Season 8. world looks toward America, nearly actually dumbest ""first world"" country planet, infecting population hundreds thousands per week, virus thats might make America DUMB.

FANTASTIC! No, think underestimate American culture journalism, gonna come out, one way other. I'm jealous twice much, literally twice. pay metric shit ton taxes fund research pay need actually take drug. Dude don’t want wear mask, don’t go Walmart. Stop abusing employees job. Lol dont people care talk them? like ""meh...150k dead? oh well..""

This going bad think one reason people care much 150k people dying majority deaths old frail people. old person dies, sad sad compared young healthy person dies, especially they're kid. That's also reason people arne't taking virus seriously. majority deaths people elderly. result, young people think they're going die bother taking social distancing seriously. virus 10% fatality rate among young healthy people, especially among kids, people would taking virus lot seriously. People would scared go anywhere.

Also fact country USA whole individualistic. People want freedom whatever want choose express themselves, problematic trying contain virus. Also country, big percentage americans trust government. Ever heard story boy cried wolf? lied enough times someone, eventually trust actually tell truth.

Another reason people arne't taking virus seriously gone nearly 6 months overtime, people get numb fact virus going on. exposed something long time, eventually get used overtime, becomes new normal seen big deal. first month coronavirus outbreak, everyone panicking losing mind, several months, people got used coronavirus started take seriously past.

Also, fundamental desire go socialize people. Humans hard-wired this; plus society still based physical interaction people outside world. going hard contain virus. Total. Shit.

The spread virus cannot remain exponential isolated community. large fraction population gets infected number uninfected people decrease, naturally slow spread disease, leading prolonged outbreak.

Also approval rating 30% (up two points). Considering poll error margin 3.2%, article really say much line original argument, might want check proportion Germany's budget gets spent military vs healthcare.

in case- bought rundown two-flat chicago $129,000 1996. personally labor rehab it, lived one unit renting other. 2008, sold $400,000.

while renting it, perks gave tenants-

to move in, needed first month's rent, 1/4 security deposit, rest paid next 3 months way.

rent included heat, water, cooking gas, broadband internet, cable-tv w/premium-level package(all premium movie channels), free use basement laundry. 

we always gave tenants half-off rent december christmas present.

the tenants could break lease w/no penalty giving 45-day notice.

security deposit could used last month's rent.

I knooooow! confused hell me! took daughter camping across states birthday. cooped bored lately. brought food drinks filled tank left! Didn’t see anyone. :) easier give meth. hardly ever enforced. Yup that's mean sorry clarifying that's interesting. Okay I'll definitely avoid friends recently went FL. going besides essential store runs, I'm wondering long could potentially take hit I'm trying make mental notes I've seen people case test positive. according scientist 90% chance vaccine won’t get accepted..? I'm LA County, think we're fine.

Obviously great news NY. virus spread there, I'm sure conclusion warranted. really think suddenly got act together stopped virus. credit though, hard parse causality this. could right - think are, that's fine, defendable position.

NY ""officially reopened ""over month ago. low hospitalizations seems say something else play ""strict lockdowns = suppression containment.""

E: read right suggesting 15% Infection Fatality Rate? know troll feed you. EVEN ""just flu"" know...obviously not. regular old flu hitting amazon tribes would kill zero immunity outside illnesses. again, Covid-19 flu, even was, would still wipe fuckton people amazon. agree vaccine data open all, hackers also accused multiple hacking thefts including stealing AI solar research.

They're trying heroes. parents, siblings, families headed northern Wisconsin family reunion end week. Flying 5 different states, experiencing rising cases. family one decided go. Here's hoping spread anything they're there.  Nobody believes HIT actually 70% Even ultimate anti-herd immunity dommer Lipsitch said probably 50% said would low 20%. would take couple weeks effect realized real problem people afraid use information think themselves. We're either brainwashed sheep them. reality ones looking sides conclude what's really going they're stuck following Corona politics.. Haha...

You must really insecure intellect feel need judge people internet grammer.

I self confident therefore feel need prove anything. Especially faceless person. think stupid teh bad grammer bee it. know kids go home school? teachers people? Well maybe one art teacher rest them. Except spread work way -- linear constant, accelerates logarithmic function.
In case spread US, probably initial ramp, tamped lockdowns, accelerating again. [plain Hopefully Google translate decent job.

It seems Folkhälsomyndigheten (Swedish CDC) even bother ensure contact tracing would feasible capacity- regulation-wise months, they're discovering problems now.

I think they've dead set herd immunity/inactivity plan, recently getting slight pressure government act, never really prepared Plan B.

That want break streak nothing (except shit-talking countries' handling coming excuses). made far ""Wearing masks potentially fatal benefits?"" serious comment noped out. Valencia California too. Valencia good too. NY - 1,676 deaths per million 22,398 cases per million.

CA - 199 deaths per million 10,358 cases per million. Easter. Use google must, young padawan.

Basically, ancient mail quite e-mail, handwritten mail either. theyre democrats. Jfc. losing polls drove actually finally promote masks? millions unemployed Americans, hundreds thousands sick people, 143k+ deaths? disgraceful, pathetically sad excuse leader. I’m glad he’s finally wearing damn mask taken long. 

I think I’ve learned politics last 3 months years combined. Turns out, politics enraging subject. Ask RFID tracker fit 0.6mm needle. People get emotional masks.

It's best avoid certain people. Better idea, close unnecessary luxuries making everyone's live worse dangerous dragging pandemic. social media everyone responde every comment. expect? yeah...

Edit: want defend point comment, stage :) bot? What’s “private company” hate? 

Yes, private companies pollute, governments pollute, certainly socialist state run governments pollute. people also smart enough stop actively spreading disease, given day goes without seeing ""person killed asking someone wear mask"" story, I'm hopeful happening. He’ll spew propaganda doesn’t want pesky sciencey people background making WTF? faces. Exactly. government says wear mask crowded spaces, dont.. arrest throw crowded space. Win win them. Political reasons. Reports withdrawal symptoms rallies, satisfy rating cravings, aides decided start virus meetings again. Haha, that's like hear. Stay safe public areas people may case inside office buildings constitutional right enforce mask policy. Rights work ways. Two weeks. Internal polls bad somehow convinced second lockdown could needed would eliminate chance re-elected. 

Plus seem drugged I’m sure helped keep focused script. looks like good time Coronavirus tbh  Who's alarmist now? funny thing i’ve see months. Holy fuck gonna watch loop one hour, waiting Karens Kyles answers. curious: gonna twist Trump right wanting control minds? god that’s better Twin Peaks. He's probably starting understand economic benefits would come it. bad already ingrained base's DNA wearing mask = violation freedom. farmers sell turkeys lose livelihood. governor promised release state's daily COVID-19 hospitalization rate. still remains one states release data daily COVID-19 hospitalization press conference Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ignored questions would release data, Miami Herald reported. That’s right. put America immediate danger. Look punk fucks trying twist shit! check dude. still got 2.5 hours left highest since June 9 1043. Many us fortunate predictable-enough lives answer ""when things go back normal?"" ""soon"".

But historic time -- world epidemic magnitude within living memory. situation like war economic depression. Right now, asking ""when safely go drink crowded bar?"" like asking ""when friends going get jobs again?"" 2009. true answer ""we know"", society (at least US) gotten kind spoiled deal ""we know"" much.

Unfortunately, political party (GOP) country promoting enacting policies like this. Fox shows up, happen. Ope, broke 1000 deaths day.

Hey dude, appreciate clarification. every death tragic, high alert news children died. three kids 5 articles headlines like scare death. said, husband getting could also catastrophic :( nice.

How dare complain family’s well one largest media companies existence create shareholder value!! What, mean think massive multi billion dollar companies saving money global event way take care employees community? It’s corporatist State! can’t even take care without government bailout! it’s one paid lobbying, it’s one use misinformation campaigns shell companies, one make gamble lawyers settlements less expensive properly enforced regulations guidelines. also, it’s much work! 

These people lazy complainers probably weren’t raised right. It’s someone else’s fault, Walt Disney Corporation’s. I've lived LA, Orange County, New York City, San Francisco SF Bay Area, continue travel often. totally agree, different places comparing numbers productive.

When think lived New York City, one thing I'm pretty sure about, left time, would've certainly infected. mean, even day 1 ""sheltered home"" still likely would've infected due living one top floors 34 floor building extremely poor insulation apartments. many people NYC, unavoidable.

In Southern California, much avoidable, much higher rate people willing wear masks, social distance, etc...

In Northern California, avoidable Southern California, people wear masks, social distance, etc...

NYC unique US infrastructure.** got backwards 10 PM corona's shift starts Gonna breach 1k deaths today. may mutate, infectious right now, selective pressure one strain gain prevalence another. mention, mutate nearly rate flu - vaccinate yearly Surprisingly, almost half recovered.

It sounds bad US 10th deaths per capita. Though looks like Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador likely take US end months two weeks. Interesting US still behind Sweden deaths per million, 437 vs 559. plans testing contact tracing quarantining otherwise protecting participants.

I don’t know quoting release adds discussion clearly never claimed that.

Everything thing mouth lie rest (when coherent) useless. New high time posting Well here's thing vaccine. Fear. Fear biggest motivator. Many anti-vaxxers getting vaccines fear alternative. deadly virus consistently touted incredibly dangerous. solid counter general idea fine without it. 

Secondly, fear translates companies well. Imagine Fortune 500 company employees could sue COVID-19 exposure? mandate employees get vaccine order return. likely legislation passed allow anything blocking requirement.

So end result would likely large portion country forced get vaccine small remaining population would hopefully small enough we'd controllable outbreaks versus massive influxes people cases.

This episode something. sure recall seeing it, comment reminded lot. Maybe people finally start seeing truth ones chickens come home roost... Yeah, NY nursing home policy led deaths 32,000 people. fact top 3 populous states America **finally** cross NY state confirmed cases, combined population 4.5 times greater NY, almost half many deaths NY **combined** really telling NY State’s disastrous decision-making. Yikes. emergency rooms going dealing alcoholics detoxing now. What? thought meant four million voted single state entire general election. Yup, wish lived world people sourced read real information, instead listening media, unfortunately, become less less trustworthy. pandemic serious, expected responsible journalism, that's went, that's lot people misguided. election year, is, we'll see happens. It’s rocket ship. rocket Challenger. See exactly point, everytime society reaches point “happy medium” guys move goalposts. China traces [2 several confirmed cases outdoor transmission? Nah that’s high, gotta 0 let fun outside again.

It’s ridiculous. literally cannot win appeal emotion “but people dying” strong, despite logic know specifically dying concentrate taking care alone. actually. campaign events/ego-props labeled 'briefings'. greatly underestimate powers. Prepare face full might dark side. appropriate response is, ""I tell leave follow store policy."" would. wear mask small apartment, large amount amenities apartment solutions like Urby must really suck.

Great amenities can’t use. get back small apartment.

Must really suck.

On flip side, excited don’t need hear name WeeWork again. bad it’s almost verging good. Ecstatic hear this, really!! husband 50 &amp; 62...heart conditions too. since March &amp; fearful. glad got glad ok!!!!! Everybody thought impossible. Cheap oceanfront real estate opportunities 3... 2... 1....... TERRIBLE. paid much whose friend private company mess?

Contrast L.A. County's publicly available data. 

http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf giraffe sucking nose? know I’m bit narcissist neither hoarded flouted safe coronavirus policy? like person identifies “liberal CT” like anything he/she said. sick politics country. 

But anyway, agree said, NY got hit hard nobody knew fuck virus. bunch antivirals guesses treat hoped best. stabilized patients struggling breathe die hours later blood clot nobody knew could happen yet. 

The reason NY gets praise shit got real followed leaders, wore masks, went little possible flattened curve. Even things open up, people (for part) still socially distance &amp; wear masks to. adapted. Anyone complaining NY needs check priorities.

Edit: want people really read second points little detail. Imagine you’re doctor dealing COVID patient presents fever shortness breath. give Tylenol fever &amp; whatever help breathe. Tylenol works &amp; you’ve stabilized breathing. ~6 hours later guy dies blood clot you’re left questioning whether missed something. review see didn’t miss anything. see patients. know fucking virus causes blood clots. X amount people died it’s novel virus nobody knew could cause blood clots. put blood thinners never happens &amp; becomes common knowledge. People get hot spots better treated know blood clots, knowledge NY doctors didn’t back March/early April. I’m sick people downplaying death rates making sound like NY shitty job handling virus. mistakes made leaders? Absolutely. took shit seriously &amp; we’re opening properly steady positivity rate &amp; declining hospitalizations &amp; deaths. Man im tired shit... Trump finally locked away prison upstate NY he's going die lack air time. 10 days get back work quicker. incubation period alone 5+ days, earth would 10 day period enough cover long incubation+ symptomatic patient? Nice think highly service workers  largely agree you. perspective country done well, isolated island nation, people take advantage democratic freedoms actively behave foolishly, behaviors also seen US.

In democratic countries also deal covid decently, observation, percentage population believe 5G tinfoilery directly correlates government's success handling crisis. respect, government's mandate limited success, tragedy successful prevention. better covid, less people believe exists.

That's direct observation, scientific fact. scientific fact, New Zealand case very, very, different US. geography totally different, demographic makeup. direct comparison two place, opinion. US would never able get point achieve zero active cases, time could done much, much better has. Remember last time happened Front Range? *really* worried proud passing even though thought really hard, *definitely shouldn't* brag doctors surprised able pass can't go Weekend Bernie's. people families record death issue death certificates.

Hello all,

My significant currently live NC. furloughed mid-March (full-time service industry jobs upsacle restaurants) coronavirus hit, applied accepted unemployment. unemployments extended PEUC. moving Chicago area end month closer significant others family. trouble finding clear information affect benefits.

SO's mother also high-risk individual contract COVID adds another layer concern.

Thank help! much needed shit over. Kids need taught competent people ever. can't risk life either. Shhhh government cares called SOCIALISM THATS EVIL HELLO??? 

If ever want proof deep south needs literally wiped away go check r/conservative sub. argument literally nothing big business. care people reddit say. completely based virus spreads. never addressed argument. Enjoy hypocrisy. Ha yeah thats happened (sans spitting. fucking asshole grabbing big handful ass walked crowded bar.) ive never felt anything like -- something inside broke didnt moment think reached landed slap straight across fuckers face. cut family forever. 
 
And actually sat thought possibile ramifications consequences this? always bad thing.
 
Your kids, choice. Right, exclude guy who's head Allergy Infectious Diseases. help us. /s  terrified fired today. ""Not team player"". cycle silence continues, unless choose spend hours time formulating elaborate reports various organizations. could file legitimate reports RCMP, fire Marshall, social development, public health, local health inspectors. 

Instead, spend time memtally healing hell jump right another job. Thankfully one lined looks much much nicer, can't afford gap income. Thankfully wrongful dismissal, supporting documentation. least side.

We told like changes made, could ""be replaced Filipino workers would willing work"". hard workers people want things right treated worst. 

Long term care needs hands government. Private owners killed many. covid situation actually bringing things light. proportion 4 million small states minuscule, no: zero states Thank you. nothing really concerning enough test (my gf works children protect her, coworker, parents, children, teachers makes sense test...)

Excessive individualism
2. Much low vitamin levels &amp; magnesium

5. much paranoia estimates ‘true’ number might be? way 4 million, right? We've herd Sweden. Zero credibility book. try &lt;3 Especially 1/3 county thinks guy's good president. cut military spending 80%, fight Covid Disney day 👋🏽 Lol, love us oil.

But think comparing post Soviet era Ukraine, midst revolt government takeover quite literally 0 standing army time Crimean incident essentially fully armed operational us kind unfair. 

It's like saying ""oh, bully kids elementary school kicked shit kids, I'm going make sure arming hunting rifle pitching outside house. Ya know. sure get bad ideas."" another resident, could agree more. \*Glares Huntington Beach\* COVID stopped way becomes negligible side-show never chance infect sizeable amount population. PRC RoK set example. RoK even without really hard NPI. @letsBurnCarthage 

I think contacting strangers, rather distant family members friends might've come contact with, share home with, like closest family members.

Personally, think applicable strategy. understand people see hard thing do.  1/3 get, 2/3 don‘t get. better ask symptoms reason critical employees feel safe stay home doubt. get permanent resident status bringing $5 million country. They'll get fine. Borders closed permanent residents citizens. take longer months re-launch plans though. lot planning need fixed dates year advance. What? even read article? think catch CLOSED WINDOW? JFC 🤦‍♂️ wish could buy empathy bulk give half people sub. Killing old people: new ""human"" hobby young. Close already! one NEEDS GO theme park. Sorry Mickey.. Oh god reading article made shake head. People become sissies it‘s hard believe... asshole could tell I'm beating meat IM BEATING MEAT MIRROR believe him.

Also, get bathroom, pervert!  one day? European countries pandemic, US mortalities increased 55 % past two weeks. Totally. I'd actually feel pretty safe outside, last place want outside FL july, dawg. exactly misinformation specific day week huge impact numbers reported. Come now. effect obvious since March. Don’t put negative energy bro entitlement, people want inconvenienced wear masks Great work!  Tax deductions... ""Kids get spread disease!""

/show research says do, especially older ones

""Well least die!""

/show examples children dying

""Well ones underlying health conditions, least youngest kids safe!""

/show examples relatively healthy infants, toddlers, young children, teens, etc. dying


 ""Well anyway, tiny percent cases!""

/show math explains even small percentages mean hundreds thousands CHILDREN DYING

""Well learn live it.""

And on.

It matter large number Americans underlying health conditions, either known unknown. matter death toll, strange symptoms side effects, might long term permanent. matter every single person lost loved dearly family taken earth sooner would otherwise giant tragedy. even matter applies goddamn CHILDREN. BABIES.

It's something happens people happens them. suddenly care. Unless extremely sociopathic double even harder. 

""Yeah maybe dad/sister/uncle/grandma/kid died but...still hoax flu!"" Better yet, post relevant CDC page directly, one. Cant explain drive, plenty insane many swedish defenders come running negative article sweden gets posted. basically stopped coming honestly overwhelming argue know moving there. Numbers dropped sufficiently longer believe case. far optimistic. Yeah.. that's fair. make less annoyed. said “cases” trend downward. Sure, numbers will, run fewer tests. Yet governor Missouri thinks need get back school. decent people peaceful lives dont stories tell Wow Missouri, keep running next Florida. Israeli, I'm American! spent time Israel, familiar country conducts affairs--shutting Sabbath, allowing proselytization, making illegal deny Holocaust. understands. understands he's going fudge numbers help Trump. absolutely disgusting looking forward books movies, come over. bet learn shocking shit. Well don’t 10x official figures either. estimate proof. Let alone know testing March different testing today. Given positive rates today, assume larger percentage positives March?


All said none changes math. 100k cases day it’ll take 4 years.

At 200k cases day it’ll take 2 years. 


Either way, it’s 1.3 million cases day. literally gambling I'm glad see we're getting public health professionals talking cautiously hope vaccine. 

If get one, big ""if"", ready time soon, take get tested, prove works, prove serious side effects, manufacture distribute enough people. 

It's much likely able develop vaccine all. say ""how long stay dormant"" asking long exposure show symptoms? average time 5 days take long 14-21 days symptoms appear.

And people asymptomatic still spread disease. help either, whining past. One thing also seems weird EU US paid AZ billions start producing doses rist yet *might* million doses years end. 

They know vaccine works months that, they're finessing EU US. Haha, statements. became ex came home lack 80,000 dollars. hey, baby sweet threads kicks, less 6 months. Hahaha. caution: lot reports anti-bodies diminish quickly, may immune point. probably right. tried google posting dozens results attributed him. Incorrect, that’s perception based understood comments. reality I’m one person part team modeling potential outcomes even could post model reddit (which impossible logistical legal reasons) wouldn’t able understand without someone giving high level interpretation like one you’re commenting on. Rt.live estimates Florida’s transmission rate 1.01, it’s farfetched cases might start going soon. slowly high number, many many people die. Congrats, Governor? Shouldn’t tag removed reposted correctly. lot people use sub won’t even look misleading title flair.   going still moving NM? partial immunity theory seen suggested explanation low case counted SEA Yunnan presumably virus came. current virus well adapted humans well read somewhat difficult explain Narrator: will. place promotes embraces anti-intellectualism, hyper-individualism, outright arrogance virtue. 

It's perfect recipe making people think they're absolute shit. Ah man. South Carolina pretty bad. Places like grocery stores people wear masks.. much bars/restaurants/massage/salon type places. like, everywhere.  understand question. That's point. failed astronomically people still think we're best country earth.

They're planning sending children back school September! government give crap us proven throughout history. We're partially blame stopping got far. get health insurance that? Non-American here. economy 40%? think know talking economy single number. Don’t see problem testing strict quarantine enforced. yeah don’t open border anytime soon. Yes, 4 days ago. stand assertion. Death toll comparatively low 65% Indian population 35. lol article behind paywall. 

You register. Hey seem right. That's good. take consideration way daily cases doubles days, similar compound interest math terms. Source: literally dozens sites track shit.

However, please remember saying ""the article right one"" Reddit basically useless minutes. link? Also studies show immunity temporary, little weeks several months.

FTFY.

Do bag rest humanity in. lot people *do* care dies. Right... Ethical??? ppl making 100 million USD/yr... ethical? True using numbers assuming started January current rate ~300,000 infected per day. 52m / 180 days. 1.5 years 60% infected Wow.

WOOOOOOOOO!!!! virus bring Nature Boy! mask mandate inside businesses done anything seems Nobody cares. single government institution. Good thing herd immunity strategy, then.

(Also, friendly reminder vaccination causes herd immunity.)  dick... right thing. agree entirely. hypothetical. republican elected official either political party / ideology. individual elected official, party. Again, lumping whole that's tell tale sign bigotry. 

What Trump need controlled this? Things quite well decided play doctor. realize dislike man data backs efficacy. time really failed us decided try negotiate virus pandemic, clear science strong point. I’m sorry hear that. think history show people ignorantly chose deliberately infect (this Real Thing btw) come regret idiocy hard. 

This disease really *really* bad news.  perfect metaphor level discourse expect right. comment made sense last one, makes lot sense. Hope find way get that, glad ex.  DeSantis “hold beer” People would attend RNC? 

Yes. 

I’ve got several teachers family. They’re tossed directly harms way Donald Trump wants re-elected. Literally nobody else thinks it’s good idea, everyone along chain going along it.

People moderate low titers however, increases. Again, huge sure upwards trend. mentioned earlier, mild cases often need time antibody titers go up.   Now, compare data labs? think actual data compares pretty well. lot 'oh god antibodies going down' headlines, lot data suggests slow expected decline months - think normal. Yes, think herd part comes from?

Yeah, kidding. think people understand sarcasm looking up/downvotes.... hope Cuz OC full redneck morons accept comments I'd still grab beer guy, though.  shit lmao assume people stupid? Talk little daddy.




I’m surprised noticed, everything said absolutely anti-capitalism. Shocking. It’s almost capitalist society NEEDS people die people work whole lives corporation sees expendable, mega corporations keep making bread baby. gives fuck poor dumb people die lmao deserve dumb poor. long someone winning it’s ok, losers whole existence doesn’t matter all.




Capitalism kin total war. great advancement great cost human lives. pro-capitalism like pro-war. totally fine people dying enslaved corporate culture long doesn’t effect negatively benefit it.



And time talk stranger internet browsing reddit provide argument whatsoever. Brilliant. perfectly fine resources have. said before, can't back rhetoric. unrealistic. took test 2 years ago. He’s lot mental decline since. keep saying 'per capita' useless metric. I'm sure that. New York hit beginning thing flying completely blind learning go. 3+ months removed learned lot treatment. Also, younger people making cases cases less likely result death. could combination better treatment + younger demographic Look deaths per day, that's drastic improvement. cases per day going deaths per day going down, that's sign virus lethal suspected. ""wait see"", **months** declining data like this.

In May 500-1000+ deaths per day. We're &lt;300 many days. That's nearly 3 months data wind August.

EDIT: Meant 300 100, still declining look graph. think real conclusion drawn possible NY NJ peaks way higher states receiving total cases, know testing capacity good early going. like back June Utah Sub's favorite ""They going run beds!""

That failed.


Texas hospitalizations flat last 10 days. Admissions probably falling. Texas 11k free beds 1k free ICU beds counting surge capacity. higher last week.


Oh remember sub constantly talked Arizona? See stopped?

Because Arizona's hospitalizations falling cliff.

There lag AZ admission data 50% since July 4th

Arizona free beds month ago.

Arizona COVID-19 hospitalizations 15% last week. Ventilarors down. ICU down. COVID-19 ER visits 35% last 2 weeks.

So virus peaked naturally fading Arizona, flat-lining Texas, slowing Florida, etc next ""THEY GOING NYC TWO WEEKS!!!"" obsession?

Idaho? report Connecticut Health Dept. would use guns defend people want limit access guns? would normalized now. 

Press X doubt Stayed Marriott 2 weeks ago, everyone mask on. Probably depends are. hotel seemed pretty empty too. thought good job protections. tried like, two weeks Denmark. work well they'd hoped (put contact tracing job someone that's 1000% unskilled super ill = yea, they'll shitty job). wonder sweden knows already tried. waters investigated hmmm fishy

But Rick Scott investigated, company found super duper guilty... Nothing see here!

Fascinating mind Trumper works lol  That's unwatchable site ever visited. Ten pop-ups, 5 videos starting automatically.

Waiting sources destroy live. say this...I work Mayo Clinic. One employee benefits access great employee-only gym. that..they incentive employees go go cheaper is. Obviously....when Covid first hit, gym closed. non-medical staff (such myself...i researcher) told stay home. came back aroubnd end April, several weeks MNs stay home order ended governor. 


Overtime, state slowly opened up. currently Phase 3. means indoor outdoor dining (at limited capacity course), retail opened up, important conversation....gyms open 25% capacity. Alot local gyms city opened.


You know one not? Mayo Employee Gym. glad opened. clinc best protect employees result...the patients. 

so yea....if Mayo Clinic opening gyms....yours either

TLDR: Mayo Clinic opening employee gym even though state says open dont moron go gym goddamn pandemic.... completely agree you. replying guy said ""oh, little fatigue"", trying make aware fatigue, especially chronic fatigue, big deal, something downplayed.

Thank explanation hope someone buy lasting effects read post sink in. gets 100% freedom. respecting people fear death do. People also choose allow near them. worried, option distance others. Car accidents common, people still choose drive; and, yes, many people choose wear seatbelts though may die get seriously injured. believe would regret way, mind theirs. may value comfort lives odds presented them, can't tell wrong it. think testing point bit overrated. someone flu like symptoms classic Covid-like symptoms mid-July - one usually sick -I think there's better good chance Covid treated such. americans, savings account consists much credit left cards. name Karen. admittedly know Florida Texas teachers would lose retirement. job (at movie theater) called back canceled opening plans within week. Still haven’t gone back yet. brains needed $300 big one. cheap compared hospital bills. Username checks out? ever remember time mocked GoP make Trump front runner? yeah... (And Ayn Rand) isnt moron he's self fulfilling prophecy maker

Praise be

or time stated france would populated undead mimes terrorist attacks yeah... (Immigrants EU) Exhibit color underwear, information white outside brown inside back.

Exhibit B: new sensei rises darkness source this? I’ve followed closely never heard Fauci say masks don’t work. prob!   Well, link says ""This study conducted better understand demographics mask wearers US"" which, me, suggests they're attempting extrapolate it. 

That said, upon looking closely actually see mention mall all. ""36 different retail locations across 5 counties.""

What defining ""retail locations?"" sounds like non-grocery store, still sampling people OK shopping pandemic, imagine over-samples non-maskers. boothill, mostly prairie land, farm land, foothills lakes forests/caves. nah, lots poor folk W L C T

 R K E article linked suggested lower viral load asymptomatic people kind disagrees saying... although suggest longer period contagious, that's *more* contagious difference important. Unless read wrong? Keep loop then. terms people’s experience it. Right people don’t feel anywhere near bad 9/11, mainly it’s sickness terrorist killing.

It’s numbers rise dramatically start know someone died personally reach “9/11 feeling” level bad. People afraid Big Brother download them

I love someone built healthy paranoia around online presence years. agree statement people Android phones. apple phones. Use Gmail. Use Facebook. Use steam. Use Reddit. Use x million apps phone. Privacy farce gonna dig heels government. one ""company"" hold account privacy god forbid let them! don’t viruses mutate rapidly? effect severity syndromes? wouldn’t effect quickly body identifies virus? Would say death less harmful? Consider enlightened.  Rofl ..is anything life blame persons choice ? personally know plenty skinny poor people extremely fat rich people.   pathetic it? fast people turn backs him..when finally advocates masks now? that?! WTF?! choose “download guest” give email address. actual login. That’s able download whole thing. What, mean emergency COVID 19 window AC unit fund? Pleb. Yeah sneaky wording. wonder many deaths happen shut again. LOL exactly MO basically known for. Especially 417 area.  Idk like kids follow parents wishes 100%. know CDC collects information tries ( ). 

Compare ""Deaths Causes"" either ""All Deaths involving COVID-19"" confirmed numbers. columns tries parse influenza deaths, covid deaths, pneumonia causing illness, never quite clear cut mess things. 

Note lot processing verification person's death certificate, deaths 1 8 week delay, numbers recent weeks complete. Masks important bulwark COVID. reality situation. *feel* like sort conspiracy, ploy make submit (of course one ever explain fucking end submission sought), impediment breathing. none things. **You special, special insight magical knowledge.** 

Just wear mask grateful something helps. ""anti mask"" base. nutballs already turned back trump thinks ""he caved"" LOL customer mention me. didnt know say. work Disney? friend work one stores. works retail he's finally loving something job.

He gets tell people can't come in. CDC bad enough. oversight all. Everything lies fake news. You’re right. 

Lemme call revolution starting buddies we’ll get done.  Percent positive gives average number tests done positive. New cases per day takes account another variable (change tests per day). this, variation change new cases per day partially accounted change tests done per day, whereas percent positive gives relatively average number disregarding variation change tests done per day. Thanks comment. I'm going pandemic ends catch something like cold. anyone replace them. unprecedented. Real estate going collapse. millions homeless rioting. Yep. bought house. made offer day saw it. Average turnaround area 1 day commission banks earned based size loan. Bigger loans = bigger commission percentage, plus less paperwork money.

*Edit* please keep 69 upvotes k thanks! Number stores makes feel terrible minimum wage, public facing essential workers too.

I'm essential worker I'm mostly working independently office...so me, kinda whatever...but feel people worked whole time come worse.

I tried tell unemployment forum strive better unemployed lower paid essential workers since we're part working class....meh, them, them, selfishly. appreciate input much common trend ""oh wells, sucks them"" *shrugs eye roll* Another option contact building owner directly. Presumably put signs up. Say people building making feel unsafe they're wearing masks communal areas. formal complaints process could end evicted, I'm sure no-one wants. Explain owner want get evicted, want wear masks. See say. it'll building owner word security neighbours. Masks seem act back door vaccine, viral load small body able fight easier. 

Pure speculation part, could pretty far reaching implications viruses.  Plus u dont need much win least nominated. 

During primaries, trump think statistically got 5.5% total vote. 

50% vote 
20-25 vote blue 
20 voted republican politician trump
Trump gets 5% yet wins nomination. 

So care publicity, money...etc Good point. shield protects eyes, another mucus membrane face.  week! got it! mobile app right face ! I’d interested control.

Seems shoddy great! I’m really glad UAE enforcing masks almost everywhere. actually really reduced spread virus here. I’m CT one lowest positive percentage positive rates, I’ve heard multiple stories week 7-10 hrs waiting get tested. ...But also wouldn’t hurt wish pray #4. need one coronary event. I’m happy send Combover Caligula unlimited Fish Filets part Arizona testing capacity maxed out...so hard really tell. Yeah I'll that, bet left nut already though I'm asymptomatic. 

And seems, TOP that, going get it, going get mild case. didn’t think unemployed right great?

Oh yeah it’s get UI you’re laid know data fit narrative folks, immediately seen bullshit. can't come say, ""look data, surging cases exploding bad"" say ""this data bullshit, Hospitalizations going down."" 

There many instances counting test results, counting Hospitalizations, counting deaths, severe lag reporting.

Real examples NJ:

Yesterday, county reported 9,893 cases, today reported, 9903. also reported 43 new cases. math yourself. happens daily, likely difference positive number tests get reported actual new infections. think states labs enough time right figure difference everyday?

Today, NJ reported 9 deaths. 2 June, 2 last 24hrs. straight head department health today. 

NJ currently around 800 Hospitalizations, less half confirmed COVID, remaining assumed positive dashboard tell that. data fluctuates place.

These made theories, directly governor DOH. Every state lie. extremely complex set steps taken every single day update data. Getting data dozens upon dozens hospitals every single day, reviewing hundreds death certificates, lab delays, testing delays, human error going happen. 

The way weed look trends, comments ground, trying piece together. Sure sketchy shit going on, doubt, even honest states making plenty mistakes. everyone get you, follow data dig need to. kids would even shittier education everyone stayed home safe. months year make huge deal long run kids age. really think much learned school HS years blend together. 

I currently k-12 school, teacher parent speaking personally affected. We’ve heard arguments before, actually. 

“Climate change unstoppable we’re gonna anything let happen”. August 10th me. tremendous indictment culture selfishness overtaken world. People incapable thinking feeling 'we' instead 'I'. response covid US particular disgusting, sign moral rot heart economic social systems. already wearing mask social distancing, thing think practicing good hand hygiene. public, avoid touching face. get home, take mask make sure wash hands soap least 20 seconds.

Also *may* link vitamin deficiency likelihood severe infection. IIRC data conclusive this. mega doses, somewhere around 3000IU/day reasonable. Way go Arkansas finally top 5 something!!! deeply red mountain states like Montana, Wyoming, Idaho usually near top. Ie, among highest rates exponential spread, even original seeding small.

I've wondering they'd finally show national news media. Given politics, much hope they'll contain it. It’s crowded, like 20 active cases near area. exercising daily basement fine. I’ve contemplated sitting backyard class less stressful. 

I feel like neighbourhood wouldn’t crowded I’d rather take 0 risk (inside) 0.01% risk, ya know mean? Thanks suggestion though condolences. neighbor said friend’s church outdoor services almost one wearing mask. said church blocked pews social distance feels safe people wear masks. 

I wear mine difficult get used to, mainly cloth ones push glasses face suffocate me. tried blue disposable ones orders magnitude easier breathe in. use surpass COVID-19 recent dust allergy diagnosis. I’m sure contributed inability breathe cloth ones couldn’t figure wear didn’t smash glasses. tried kinds creative complicated crap, lol. Oh well, cute masks me, guess. able - courts immediately overwhelmed enforcing eviction also going happen quickly. mention easy find new tenants, IMO wiser let people stay.  reads books? Surely Americans. Even vaccine effective...I'd say next spring/summer back normal. yes That’s urban legend  speculation beginning. Wait, isnt bad? still get virus wouldnt even know spread lol pay somebody $50 hour locally PBC? two date. dude, without rat people there'll boy band asian turtle ninja costume.

pay respect. Think difference 5 ants house, 100 ants house. lot harder (your immune system covid) get rid 100 ants (covid) 5 ants. multiply one multiply faster thing get rid it. live Florida area typically see tourists, especially summer months. last months brought many towners. state license plates everywhere. actions governor's nothing drive people state ours. Particularly New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina Ohio.

 infuriating watch see praise New York. Cuomo ban people leaving state, pushed people disagreed lockdown people carried virus around. contain virus, spread it. might worth seeing person. need money, crazy..? can't use pieces house pay bills buy groceries. - mortgage rates still fairly low.

or could sell take money inheritance instead. SUCCESSFUL vaccines train immune system. step towards successful  fuck one goat... wouldnt say 90%. induces antibodies dont know long. also dont know prevents virus.

Antibodies positive sign...but alot unknown. Uhm... already well known. Like incredibly well known. can't overstate it. thought r/notinteresting first. 

The inverse exactly young healthy doctors got really sick died. Super exposure. Exactly. Pisses everyone reporting except sources “conveniently” failed mention piece. Even AAP President make statement correct context said. Hopefully appealing MAGA crowd’s self-interest change behavior. Assuming 80% infections asymptotic. Ok, read source? read blatantly lying? 

Fauci said *healthy* people shouldn’t wear masks, knew many infected people asymptomatic. realized asymptomatic people spreading disease high rate, recommended everyone wear mask. 

Fauci never said masks don’t work. spreading misinformation. Maybe time take running, area crowded. People still running talking point? explain CDC USPHS fumbled ""wear mask"" common sense straight gate? need worry.

They definitely address airborne risk. yet still understand headline viral load symptom severity masks stopping coronavirus lol shouldn’t shock. taking precautions you’re supposed take. system *works*

We need spend less time freaking mostly outdoor business reduced capacity mask mandates, time trying get message people stop hosting dinner parties living room ragers. That's fair point, also good reason put ultimate trust wearing mask evidence looks promising. know masks 100% virus-proof, still could getting percentage every cough trail, Asian countries cited effective containing virus wearing masks also much healthier socially conscious Americans. understanding virus incomplete, that's people need hear, masks prevent virus studies show masks block majority one single expulsion. doubtful everything hear, especially cases continue rise. tested people 18-60 range they're going give people outside range. importantly, it’s patriotic! sort controversial. I’m sure they’re already here. “bUt FaUcI sAiD NOoNe nEeDS mASk 4 mOnThS aGo” Stupid citizens elect stupid politicians - best folks - garbage in, garbage - George Carlin Im dumb apologies stupid question make sense... 

If get small viral load, contract disease end asymptomatic, evidence immune future?

Mister Death ""We United effort defeat Invisible China Virus"". can't believe still calls that. ridiculous. least he's starting try get people wear face masks. time. California? Well... goes theory. problem since Chinese wear it, must wrong. wear mask, communist China, CCP. American would rather die free live mandate. Poor police. One safest occupations existence, safest times, whine like little babies. Wah, mommy, duh big bad man cawed name. wonder theres heat map scientists per population, compared mask use rates, compared cases... love heat maps. viral load? think I’ve heard term recently. Unless got cuts hands can't wash sanitize, gloves useless. I've seen countless people touching face dirty gloves. driving alone mask gloves on. norm many, many places. expect remain norm many them, too. question death bad (it is) coronavirus real (it is). question exactly much disruption society acceptable prevent many deaths? 

Would average person give away possessions future earnings save stranger’s life? Probably not, right? 

Would average person give dollar save stranger’s life? Probably yes, think. 

The fact matter is, reasonable ask people make sacrifices others, reasonable ask sacrifice everything. 

So much long term damage willing save many lives? matter they're family. live household, wearing mask super necessary.

It's nothing health company everything marketers investors convince people worth.

And that's economic system. Ponzi schemes way down. Viral load determined exposed it’s already replicating. exposure. 

This person claiming mask gives less exposure (which does) thus means less severe symptoms. completely false. Viral load doesn’t correlate viral load. Thus exposure doesn’t correlate severity.

Some already know flu applies coronavirus. One dangers flu spread submicron aerosolized droplets. seems coronavirus spread submicron droplets well. dangerous primarily two reason:

1. hang air 12+ hours. Gravity doesn’t dominate force small particles. virus spreads primarily airborne transmission.

2. enter host alveoli lungs. temporarily bypasses immune response virus substantially cultured infected mucosa pharynx. point already contagious shedding virus through, guessed it, sub-micron aerosolized droplets breathe out. It’s terrifyingly beautiful way.

Because delayed immune response, initial infection dose plays big role severity illness. body fighting exponential growth virus approximately four day head start. small increase number pathogens initial inoculation, make big difference immune system finally able react. Take back charge interest. hear you. companies  examples listed, lot regulations laws associated them. mask wearing? definition ""mask"" even means. wire mesh mask? not? 

What masks mainly governor mayor says do. acceptable? mayor enforce masks wearing today, stopping another mayor enforcing 30 min exercise day tomorrow?

I think answer clear here. fallacy all.

First, asymptomatic transmission known late January, one really knows whether sick not. Thus, emphasis, ""healthy.""

Second, masks known protect wearers respiratory viruses dating least back SARS 2003. want go even back, Spanish flu 1918. mean wish harm upon anyone, I'd like point seems mean refuse wear masks fact much likely die coronavirus little worried folks back HK due sudden rise cases. heard tracing origins going well (more info needed, thanks) hopefully precautions back place would help curb like before.

More likely there's nuance saying cloth masks effective. I'm sure saying they're good n95 something, cotton masks, far tell, effective capacity.

Thanks!  find gorcery manager job company mandate masks? frankly like idea letting customers employees taking seriously exist one store, rest us could live shop work real world. People flying committing study, leaving. Americans wear masks.

That really apply patented medicine though. tape bureaucracy leftist cities

Do think red tape beurocracy leftist idea? competition / crony capitalism

Crony capitalism already exists, absolutely current US medical system. Lobbying government? falls crony capitalism. I'd argue Americans give money need otger country world

Nope. fact US rank top 10. I've seeing doctor normal stuff via zoom since march.. course something routine bit mixed question imagine general practitioners keeping appointments far enough apart minimal contact. (normal stuff medication check adjustments.. stuff really need physically present anyway) keep repeating half country fucking morons. sarcastic but, sure?   death count disease have, got right number.. Ok? Unfortunately there's bazillion ways fuck Americans first time life diagnosed shingles (Monday) next day got tested Covid (weakened immune system due shingles), following day woke sore throat. since last Wednesday I've shown symptoms Covid. Coughing, wheezing, fatique, headache, sore throat feels like elephant sitting chest. 

My question - long wait Covid testing results come back? week now. go get retested? know labs overwhelmed. I've calling Trump virus weeks now. think that’s loaded question. seen reports viral titer impact symptoms (I think Italian study) time, high viral titer going generate response whether immune (e.g. cytokine storm) killing cells. 

I’ve asked question haven’t received response. Also take response grain salt, grad school immunology knowledge work viruses still although non-pathogenic kind. lol, laughed harder 2nd time read it.. Lmfao, doesnt give flying rats fucking ass supporters Speaks guy defending china regarding Uyghurs. trust bud

- Canadian Low key expecting division team mask team anti-mask. It'll show parents educated not. 🤷‍♂️ Wow, smart enough American, even suits mankind, since pandemic, realize average IQ mankind much lower thought. TIL seasoned Reddit veteran make judgments people say. That’s stupid comparison. Anything puts barrier someone else’s droplets better nothing. 👏👏👏 Well, older people generally vote conservatively. Also, forgetting party that: (a) colluded internally prevent one leaders lose last primary; (b) intentionally falsified proclaimed charges president attempt impeach him. think type behavior (creating virus) far removed one decided winning worth costs. Considering widespread availability projected early next year, availability vulnerable individuals Sep-Oct, guys think lockdowns travel restrictions would lifted? Wtf... Good thing sub seem popular. think much stupider average stupid become one those. Money something. probably thinking Government would set one national standard.

That way Karen complained could blame law. hopefully take heat teens employees earning minimum wage. 🌈 i’ve trying fucking say! correlation way back viral load sick people getting- noooooope- instead US get insane argument percentages. Canada looks nice Probably not. Big difference tourist student intentions remaining school year/semester big retail stores left? Feels like that’s every major store making masks mandatory recently could test this. Presumably, spouses less closely related genetically children siblings. could look likely die Covid given spouse did, versus likely parent (who live with) did. don’t know anybody actually tried test this.

We know least one genetic factor. People type blood seem likely get sick die people type blood. think buying Chinese stuff? ...and start complaining things new country soon arrive. Bold assume read XD. Yeah notice go far say ""wearing mask patriotic"" qualified ""many people say..."" Since don't, going make harder I'm going start seeing pushback people.

Thats nice thing folks Wal-Mart. Corporate board thry even bringing role specifically handles belligerent people.

You're going get people telling Wal-Mart workers ""quit hard ass.""

Everyone talks going suck work Wal-Mart, quick stop night shift much worse. yourself, people coming drunk get booze, necessarily anywhere retreat depending thry come in. lucky that's tarred feathered Elaborate. Still won’t shop there- dumbass this, even briefly, switched course backlash, quietly continuing dumbasses about? still plenty surge capacity though. think MedCram great job addressing *only* matter getting public policy ;-) 6/26 R governors issued mask mandates:

* Larry Hogan Maryland

* Charlie Baker Massachusetts

* Greg Abbott Texas

* Jim Justice West Virginia

* Kay Ivey Alabama

* Asa Hutchinson Arkansas

22/24 governors issued mask mandates. two holdouts:

* Tim Walz Minnesota

* Tony Evers Wisconsin (He can't, conservative state supreme court put severe limits kind exec. orders issue regarding pandemic)

Come Tim! would need ""separate conversation""

Because separate issues. I've said repeatedly.

A poverty policy inherently necessarily address homelessness.

Housing first policies inherently address poverty.

And unemployment, related, also separate issue. 

These separate issues warrant separate solutions. addressed separately. 

Everyone entitled needs met. done separation concerns. lump conversations together, exclude people solutions because... again... fucking separate goddam problems. worries! full episode usually main story plus small ones remains exclusively HBO. problem seeds doubt already sown, see many responses tweet. narrative pushed long, difficult change mind many anti-mask people. 

To correct would work long time, see Germany Nazi rule - instantly go away war ended. also definitely control went welding people apartments systems go businesses endangering others ""right"" wear mask might actually kill another person.

You actively choosing put others danger. Wearing mask protects people already risk you. 

In famous words Red Forman.

Secondly, secret Indians (many us, all), try immigrate western countries. something issue perceived western countries, including USA. 

Thirdly, American friends tell hopped UK EU residency period one expired. way able circumvent maximum stay x months one year without visa rule. possible Indian citizen. someone EU (or USA) hire me, need pay quite bit help nsure legal residency ensuring treated non immigrant. Essential: might die without it. keep posting interview recommends wear mask unequivocally?

You're shooting argument foot here. respect opinion totally disagree. absolutely top tier historic event, World Wars, much higher civil wars opinion. widespread impact way every single persons lives, massively, unprecedented. get guilt infecting grandparents causing deaths.

PS saying occur every case. Well 140k dead Covid well. 4 months since started counting. That's pretty significant. feel horrible, blew mom trying go restaurant/bar alcoholic friend&amp; kept telling going wear mask, people restaurants keep masks entire time, ya know going INSIDE, course, AC blowing strong. serious mental health/neuro problems&amp; already struggle hypoxia im freaking 110% thing I'm going say matter something long time ago. don’t want you. We’ve seen you’ve done country. think evidence cases slowly flattening. AZ tested really badly today, caveats.  Sounds like he's recommending wear masks.

Clear day. wish could find transcript, perhaps sources.

The audio interview Dr. Monica Gandhi UCSF include statement that, locations near 100% masks wearing, outbreak occurred, 95% infected asymptomatic. Go YouTube. Skip first 60% video. That's tutorial starts. Bingo. think gov national healthcare understand this. someone household it, everyone usually needs isolate - recommandations limit spread possible. Interesting logic, can’t wait see counter arguments.... Chinese numbers never never reliable. really stupid? even won’t invade foreign country vaccines 

At worst threaten economically live rural county. stop going Walmart big grocery store near mask compliance almost completely non-existent. get vaccine cannot forget ignorance America situation Yeah, Anglo-American nuclear family often kind treated like eternal truth human nature, really existed relatively small part world relatively short amount time. fun fact: nuclear family part humanity long Marxism has. Totally unrelated (well, suppose Marxist view would similar material conditions allowed emergence yadda yadda yadda perhaps Marxism fact nuclearization history?), think give little perspective. I'm artist, I'll trying stuff soon, hopefully vent crap. (If I'm honest tho, venting verified feels sooooo good)

I love him! happy trees squirrels. know used Drill Sargent? hated yelling ppl much went calm voice show.

You friend bro like telling kids go school polio outbreak. saying herd immunity on/off switch.

Bring light body Hey, tossing suggestion, voice text apps absolute godsend—assuming carry phone around you, simply use app translate speech text. obviously doesn’t help facial expressions, makes possible conversation. kinds articles hate. Nobody idea 12 months going like. know could fully functional vaccine March everything fine. Correct headline:


Coronavirus infections **could** 13 times higher across US initially reported, CDC finds.

Just saying honest reporting. Google stl “excess mortality Covid-19”, scientists already looking it. Seriously, know boys would spit elderly women reason. US data new infections deaths gone last 3 days, exactly data transferred CDC White House. magic little sharpie /s Bro news Europe you. prison get 5 years shu that. Sounds right me. going hard. following guidelines strictly, man, 5 months. cancelled family visits summer year. hard reasonable. point, though, kid need see grandparents person. Skipping summer one thing, seeing entire year another. honestly know going come winter holidays. guess suck up, get plane, wear masks even one else wipe everything can. still closed nightclubs denmark exact reason...I heard expert say nightclubs biggest fear ultimate superspreader. disney's eyes cash lives. Yeah, got wrong. proud separate rest country possible. Rick Scott made hundreds millions poor Floridians. democrats claim? Umm, phase 3 data wont available atleast another month. one? like suggest ppl drink bleach too?

He suggested inject disinfectant. idiot followers even dumber thus, unable follow simple instructions, drank instead Yeah capitalism works laws used prevent running rampant (wealthy using money gain influence branches government, income inequality rising, environmental damage sake short term profits) strong revoked. truly unregulated economy would disaster humanity would encourage destruction resources wars corporations slavery. Countries like Germany Norway capitalistic even media tell Europe socialistic hell. enough leash market preventing worst parts capitalism occurring. Lol, evidently not.  China criminal enterprise people risking lives priced novelties roller-coasters? anyone want say died pair plastic ears? bc knew everyone else /s

they're basing mers vaccine, 5 years trials behind it. done human safety trials didnt get phase 3 yet. far ahead pretty much everyone else, likely come end year early next year. like 8 year old labor camp China... He's wide margin. 4-5x many, significantly higher announced. 


The CDC says could many 216k deaths include oddly high number flu pneumonia deaths. 


Source:  ""Total Covid Hospitalizations"" think might prefer say ""Current Covid Hospitalizations"", reflect current number (which go down), ""Total"" since pandemic started (which go up) Absolutely vile.   She’s literally kid trying part helping world. Anyone problem really problem themselves. Would feel better burn amazon. actual fuck y’alls problem her. someone ask trend better cared deaths deaths went stayed since then???? trending right direction?!!! ever take media questions??? pool samples areas low community spread, keep testing individual samples areas high community spread.

Specimens come shipments together collection sites. batch 100 specimens rural county dozen positive cases state probably safely pooled (reducing number reagents used 25), hardest hit area's specimens tested separately.

When anything pool sample positive, go back retest individual samples. question regarding earlier comment: Tom Britton guy Tegnell, Johan Giesecke kept quoting beginning? arrogant asshole Yes, correct. 

I idea people downvoting you. He's using Trump logic. rather ""if stop testing, new cases drop"", he's ""infect everyone, new cases eventually drop."" dope analogy brah I....what?... Wife ""friends"" like acquaintances really, Disney World right now. Posting pictures. Absolutely one there. Place basically empty. People smart least. Read again. Sweden lower mortality Finland slightly higher Denmark.

It's based official state statistics look want to.  Thanks. actually show day week X-axis label exact purpose.  thanks idea take step further. Literally state federal regulations need kept nursing homes. absolutely need reported. neglect. never seen, visited, learned others. 

Thus: Number 1 1.  Texans Americans general whole breed selfishness vitriolic people. part get us herd immunity! main issue assume act politically correct manners. Maybe did, unhinged. wouldn’t surprised see one leaders come say loss children’s lives necessary greater economy. Organize coworkers Union now. Now. IWW great resources go won’t get fired get organized. Check IWW.org info. agree moved countries 4 times already. sister moved 3 times. packed go. Honestly immigration paperwork way harder physical move. 99% work. get paperwork done you, anything else pretty much walk park. physical moving part much different moving states, albeit language barrier sometimes.

However, single, always practice minimalism. also taught kids always ready move oppprtunity come lot prepared. see people kids/no preparation lot trouble. think long taking people's health account taking proper precautions (at least within reason), okay express annoyance current state world time time (it's shock inconvenience, minimum, pretty much everyone).

But taking precautions, asshole. Also bitching dealing it, probably also asshole. draw conclusions immunity lasting longer window observation?

You can't say anything immunity observe reinfections. People need exposed twice (which easy many people taking precautions pandemic, regardless government intervention), get infected twice, symptomatic enough time tested twice.

The fact guy still TV ridiculously sweeping statements wrong basically every time opened mouth quite amazing. Swedes must high level pain tolerance. Oops, meant private schools. BLM members aren’t elected officials. “point” non-sequitur unrelated hypothetical. Stick subject. 

Republican control Senate stopped meaningful efforts control Trump. Republican political support Republicans enables Trump. Anytime someone supports Republican isn’t trying reign in, enabling Trump. ticket Republicans need removed office. said, ""emergency use"" covid Vaccine, in, vaccinate infection. likely though massive priorization among first recipients vaccine, probbaly frontline healthworkers first, healthcare ""supply chain"", call it, second, critical infrastructure third, risk groups, rest. US approve vaccine without solid data. AZ dragging feet release Phase 3 data moving oddly slowly start trails US. 

Not scientific I'd say 50% chance failed AZ knows it. Ok I’ve told watch Newsroom link officially convinced  Thousands people volunteered risk good entire human population here's Reddit calling idiots. 1 100,000 people severe side effects vaccine, vaccine approved. Important point note. countries, notably China Iran, reported dubious data death tolls, consider asterisk sitting alongside numbers. Working have, though, United States clearly faring worse many population, remains true. United States 10th-hardest hit function population. Notice Europe, cases grew quickly early spring, accounts lot countries per-population death toll United States also currently seeing second-worst rate new deaths [Deaths last week] globally, behind Brazil. Adjusted population, daily death rate puts us tie 11th-worst internationally. Again, Kyrgyzstan worst current death toll relative size.

So right, bad Kyrgyzstan. Yay USA, better Kyrgyzstan. Hmm think that. knew people never even leave town wer born internet never thought would see countries handle discourse within.

Unlike rest world, hindsight facing time.

So no, likely know consequently took ***precautions*** case really case. hard understand? Murica slow learner meant FL alone Little premature call slowing though. One day week week decrease downward trend make. probably effective individuals time, bet CCP able figure bad based volume positive tests. exactly argument four months ago though.

And put right thing, hard. never truly locked down, never took steps countries prepare hospitals work places safe reopening, situation worse ever result. choose *again*, except right thing even harder now... shitty is, consequences keep refusing even worse. longer put off, hurts us, harder recover. 

We're ignorant. We're looking ahead, knowing family can't afford childcare six months, DEFINITELY can't afford losing parent, huge medical bill, series lock downs restarts schools go quarantine force parents find childcare fly.

They've much stronger antibody responses vaccines trial they've seen wild-type infection, virus may lead immunity, hopefully vaccination will. 

Happily, appears covid mutate anywhere near fast flu, could one shot done vaccine we're lucky. 

Aaaaand hello antivaxers - often people refuse wear masks... God going save them.

Thoughts prayers want. We'll... Take word no...MO problem covid. ask gov using covid money drum tourists. SICK. needs shoe thrown him.  Particularly now. It’s going take someone love dying wake -

It's going take someone love dying able even get admitted hospital wake up. 

That crap sure...what mean room me? Meanwhile Asian countries, normal food service workers wear mask lot someone obviously trolling Sorry incorrect. States already reopening protests broke out. Deaths started trend upward 1 1/2 months **after** protests began. true, southern states seeing huge rise cases? live Portland protests every single night since May 28, yet cases rose *slightly* reopening. New York protests riots, surge? Minneapolis, Minnesota epicenter protests large influx cases. 

The surge connected states taking precautions reopening. Protests likely small impact cases rising, state currently seeing huge cases numbers already reopening before. I’m commenting come back read this. Thanks explanation! true, many virtual K12 programs wouldn’t work. 

It’s also lot better people, idk, dying Yeah, us Ohio, too. looks like they’re going White House makes sense. get *tiny tiny* bit virus, body possibly fight quickly, someone coughs foot away inhale plume particles, body like oh fuck fuck oh shit *dead* Fight milk. don’t start first thing AM? mean cares got thousand people sick mean time? wondering, anything additional people could easily besides distancing masks? heard masks preventing spread preventing getting sick, wondering there’s way increase safety top mask could lose teaching certificates, pay frozen, employees large risk retirements.”

Not them! they're unified, least 90%, yes. Florida able enforce nearly teachers walk out. Moreover, crying front camera would damage state's reputation. 

But hey, crying administration EASIER. Abandoning responsibility EASIER. really tough position everyone else answer, you’re state really don’t understand.

Ok kiddo. Please continue ASSume do. things deal right now, constitution laws aren’t changing foreseeable future. 

You're disingenuous, everyone knows it. qualms throwing certain groups teachers bus. know, ""undesirables."" willing discuss rationally; busy passing buck decrying situation. Agreed. Baffling many people reject mask wearing. Yeah, poor Canadian students come States? one parents big ""nope"" me. wear mask, likely get bigger dose virus. likely get infected, also infection likely severe? 

Did get right simplistic? assumptions solid talking shopping malls people wearing masks everywhere general, really bias? come mask-deniers, COVID-party goers, deep state conspiracy advocates, aren’t reading articles? post highway electronic signs every state please? Yeah, that's crazy part...!

NPD, BPD, stuff said leave modifications DNA. get passed children. mean parts DNA get activated, tend become activated navigate traumatic environments - like childhood environments many grow Cluster B parents others. 

Seems pretty clear Trump's father major contributor Trumps unconditional need believe winner never loser.

Also, let's take look back - generation people lived great depression, fought WWII, survivors two types extreme trauma. gave birth baby boomer generation. 

That generation currently holding power country. 

So inform us Karen's see there, behaviors younger generations seemingly struggling across board terms home ownership debt on? Let alone politics... they're correct required, there's snowball's chance hell it'll actually happen. generation definitely unifying causes, fair lump entire generations together basis best worst members.

Look boomers. Vietnam. time, young real power stop war, forced fight it. wide spread protests it. time, generation produced people like Trump. 

Look civil rights movement. people ""The Greatest Generation"" favor it. 

And plenty examples people ""Today's generation Karen's"" exactly Rosie doing. Yay, thank mentioning one favorite series, think lot lately. he’s willing admit that, numbers must pretty bad ... Awesome thanks! wouldnt agree education lagging. costs much. Attainment still right top OECD countries.

[But reason spend much thats republicand block things like HR3.  someone used work dollar tree disgusting. customer base either poor, old, black. combination three. Meaning without health insurance, already risk blacks elderly royally fucked decide shop here. many currently active cases? Isn’t total amount since it’s began? prevented loosened protections

Don't kid yourself. really wanted shitting bombs Moscow within minutes.

It's either deterrent not. ""Loosening protection"" mean they've sent Mars lol.  Yet another consequence putting people believe government problem charge government. disgusting. anyone stand behind two faced, corrupt, ignorant, vile person completely escapes me. understanding reporting hospitalizations general, specifically COVID-19 hospitalizations. 

Is correct? facebook news says coronavirus fake.  cares bad fake virus is. even notice removed post deciding write that? delayed inevitable. start opening eventually rise cases expected. sure people surprised. it’s combination things. Yes, countries took correct steps prevent massive spread. population density play role, like everything it’s one reason. took 4 months 😂 looks like current covid hospitalizations u.s. going surpass wave 1 peak next couple days. 

I didn’t think we’d get here, it’s finally safe say infected folk late March/early April. Medicare *always* ""about run money."" Seriously, I've heard every year entire life; lost shock value point. wall palistinians He’s resented virus start. feels personally attacked it, trying downplay keep economy open ‘strong’ pre-pandemic economy strongest argument re-election. 

He’s playing devoted voter base, think hoax hysterical overreaction affects personally. completely abandoned leadership role huge crisis, hoping would disappear. he’s realizing gamble disastrously wrong he’s trying pathetic effort change course, incompetence vanity already cost thousands lives.

Basically, he’s selfish vain man doesn’t care actually leading, fame applause. crisis put huge spotlight countless weaknesses. major league baseball?!?!?! /s  Valencia oranges oranges. Fight me. state needs get Covid control first even implement plan. teacher, based current infection data CT, would go back plan. low profile half faced respirator without exhalation valve. Mothing new, different formfactor.

So people keep reposting many times day earth shattering news civilization saving invention? misleading part need eliminate virus entirely - that's needed return normal. partially effective vaccine (say, 60 percent) reduce spread strain hospitals. Combined therapeutics, pretty clear COVID dangerous year today governors top two states celebrated like heros media?  felony Yeah. thought going go tirade. Makes little worried. 1/10rst allowing obvious misinformation pass, outrage said misinformation censored? Fuck right bullshit! report customer service. man came back store chased down. spit her. Amazing budget much fat could trimmed average american.

One day one ""fiscally responsible"" republicans get elected actually that...right? mention afraid bc citizenship status, given case nos. L.A. Damn, doin thar. One “shots”. Please forgive French bus driver beaten killed asking passengers wear mask. I've tested 2 times already Covid times took less 2 days get results. week told testing results taking 7-10 days (through quest diagnostics) definitely delays numbers. Everyone involved even tangentially health care today consumed coronavirus pandemic, be. pandemic accelerating problem used front center health circles: impending insolvency Medicare.  record numbers Americans work, fewer payroll taxes rolling fund Medicare spending, number beneficiaries rising, Congress dipped Medicare's reserves help fund COVID-19 relief efforts spring.  think real, impending health care crisis,"" said Dr. David Shulkin, undersecretary health Department Veterans Affairs President Barack Obama two years led VA year Donald Trump.  Yep, roughly 3-week lag symptomatic deceased. Deaths also keyed human being, adding ""lag."" data remain accurate, start seeing regularly, worse.  Im tired Earth. Yep. We're fucked. c'est la vie, suppose.  Show New Mexico taken hundreds patients Arizona.

I'll wait proof asinine, nonsense claim.  Head Disney hole, they’re waiting clueless dolts like you! miss entertainment value. see one Trump asked Fauci come speak (and obvious back something) reporter asked Fauci saying free will? words effect. funny, funny. I’ve never laughed hard something like that. That's actually crazy shit. Tesla's inventions turned him. 24 hr news channels show gets views. I'd love proven wrong, hurting bottom line one line organizations cross consistent basis. They'll cover even cut away people watch too. 

It would better people boycotted political coverage cable news general. free C-SPAN anyways commercials.

Most people watch cable news want information, want cathartic experience. much efficient less diluted ways get information there. stepmom?

Cause walked droves people voted 16 would voted 20, abandoned solely due utterly mad response virus. issues going on, virus. switching stance internal polling showing this. That's mighty fine concern trolling  nothing new added individual knowledge Russian activities cyberspace due leak. 

Do think Special Counsel needed contractor leak document order tie Russia GRU hacking American entities? 

If want read indictment mentions nothing Reality Winner's information. specify DCCC hack.

So leaked classified information inform US public one bit new Russian activities, criminal charges came information, except hers. previous 3 straight months bad decisions, poor judgement, contradicting widely known facts, completely disregarding health wellbeing 330M people, today's presser decent. instead embarrassing display forced compliance little late page: ""People easily hypnotized likely addicted smartphones, study finds"" dad thinks defending fascists defending free speech. can’t part bullshit. didn’t understand asked defend free speech isis sympathizers people hate Italians though. uh... maybe isn’t patriot defending free speech. Shocker one visibly dislikes POTUS? week ago tweeted deaths going tenfold thought something like would happened day Walmart enforced mask policy. great behavioral characteristics shitty people academically verified.  Walmart closing National Genocide Day year ironic? though replacement loyal Fauci. puff pieces last week smart one, etc.  said donating £100.000. mentioned article £100.000. title article said £90.000?? £10.000 go? Well, US republic either, US oligarchy. politicians pick voters e.g. gerrymandering, voters picking politicians. good little before, definitely little No. wants say China Virus every 2 minutes. whole point briefing. dOnT wOrRy... vAcCiNe EnD yEaR Everything bigger Texas? stated democratic republic also known representative democracy. thing, furthermore democracy mentioned lot republic basically important american historical documents. Agreed. difference neutralizing response early following vaccination one lasts multiple months. EST GMT-4 

At least right “Wuhan coronavirus “? Hard pass Stop making laugh *dammit* least finally admitted it’s good. OK, next excuse now? report basically starts update death rates far falling.

Then goes government inquiry leading scientists, asking difficult questions

Then summarises expect future, ending optimistic point vaccine development. 

Pinch salt. I’ve looking site state data (well, California Texas): people please stop making jokes.

We can't keep joking like this, person broken house gun wants kill start trying figure survive situation.

That's need start doing, stop morbid jokes replace proactive, creative, alternative solutions. Anything that's productive positive. people support wearing masks. yeah, election. White House censor everything act like everything fine. Trump call flu I'm epidemiologist feel like us knew April eagerly awaiting data. Agreed common sense ""is set overtake New York Wednesday"".

Read headline. taking total cases.  tbf dont think we'll ever know number cases(and deaths) New York. Judging excess deaths much bigger. phrasing, quote article. said, agree original author trying dramatic. first year life I’m voting cheerleader. lack laws regulations passed actions shows ineffective one. \*freedumb 100%? Apparently Texas safe places classrooms football fields! need another... kicking customers stores refuse so. wording says likely 2 doses.

The phase 3 trials already started. seems saying first releases data 2 doss regiment current trials using 2 doses.

I know still see zero evidence current phase 3 trials using 2 dose regiment. Maybe accusing one country history something today? USA countries horrible things past, horrible things show us anything country now? dead bodies oil already wearing medical mask every time go outside distancing people, kinda basic. [""But Mickey, world needs know they're likely do, means it’s infectious less fatal. sad reality... doesnt matter really... cant cheat Excess death numbers.
So truth come eventually worries slow states spiking cases. Talk double standards even lockeddown yet? Yeah, people dumb. Walked old white man eating bagel narrow NY sidewalk café maskless people walked breathing food.

I walk face shield, mask goggles. freaks out, covers face napkin turns away.

Dude. Worry people without masks coughing directly dumb maskless face food. I'm safest mofo want around maskless Fox News watching moron thinks mask = sick. 

Sheeple, man. Wait what? supposed April 2020. Sure, local town beach. percentage people beach town? 

If travel get beach, likely visiting type indoor business, that's going risky. thought company selling production cost? rich never wanted expat past 3 years.

I've thinking since 2012 Sandy Hook. thought anti-Obamacare death panel scaremongering 2010 ridiculous efforts deny expanded healthcare two years later nobody anything aftermaths Sandy Hook.

Then realized US selfish country want make sort sacrifices make lives better others completely accepts preventable deaths (sound familiar?). attitude essentially, ""So people dying? I'm dying."" align values. reason lie well. That's drivel climate change denier never even listened her. They're mask mandate mentally fit adults acted like mentally fit adults. There's new deadly respiratory virus killed 140,000+ five months. mentally fit adult THEORY need told wear mask precautional safety measure. mask mandates there's decent amount ""mentally fit adults"" acting like ""mentally stunted children"" need taken hand safety safety towards everyone around them. weird we, Georgia map. one best results fighting Covid-19 hope test vaccines, realistically, rush us. scientists blown away. evidence support claim? Haha got love fighting strategy developed cows develop lifelong complications result faulty vaccine, like happened [Cutter faulty vaccine caused 40,000 cases polio, lead 200 paralyzations 10 deaths, responsible? pays care care dozens, hundreds thousands others adversely affected result?

We developed safety standards clinical trials reason. volunteer one phased trials way get vaccine, usually meet certain criteria qualify. won‘t able hide forever though. Excess deaths show true story. Unfortunately, usually takes several months data becomes available. point future, virus control, hope get chance go. We've gone times despite cliche, fairly magical wife kids. gotten better Disney offered services.  

It cost you, I've also gone ball regretted it. Especially various packages, cost good bit, make almost negligible cash output trip everything paid for. Heck, issues hotel/room last trip gave pretty nice amount cash form gift card used family souvenir purchases. 

Right now? magical thing right Corona Mouse. Win-nin-nin-nin-ning! possibility different strains covid varying virility mortality infecting different areas, NYC could’ve potent strain virus responsible high death rate meaning closer herd immunity sweden one risk infects due age, like saying ""please dont shoot me"" shot, he's either trying get someone klled infinetly brain dmaged actions crimes anyway.

Agree sadly kind ""misleading information"" needed get stupid people respond act appropriately. can't ""strongly suggest"" measures want x response. mandate might get closer x response. Difficulty: Reporting varies wildly place place. depends two datasets use slightly different methodologies: CDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System defines pregnancy-related death happening within year pregnancy, National Center Health Statistics uses World Health Organization's definition 42 days within pregnancy. linked straight pregnancy-related deaths, here's first explanation found possible reason USA looks bad ""on paper"". also read countries lower infant mortality . . . similar reasons. I’ve people (more one) tell real illness. Also vast majority Covid deaths really causes like heart attack stroke, ‘because also Covid’ hospitals calling Covid deaths. Don’t know answer that, people really don’t want educated. talk facts disagree Facebook feed. Yes, I’m Texas. Interesting glossed questions. apparently need context read like 6-year-old child. company exploring regimens, first readout  final-stage tests almost definitely two doses, Mene Pangalos, Astra’s head biopharma research, told reporters.

They specifically cite first readout data tests two doses. means tested vaccine double dosage people. can't believe I'm arguing someone dense. Wouldn’t rush vaccines cause zombie apocalypse /s know what's immoral? Theft. I'm American say, agree. think so. cold. 10hrs know it. right germany. Good affordable healthcare, thank god. think providing “day care” element schools provide parents free work school hours.

Heard Google? enough new infections UK moment tell vaccine's efficacy, that's need data hotspot areas. mean UK data showed vaccine work. big breakthrough

Yes. understand lot comes News reporters scientists. Oxford Vaccine breakthrough but-


 scientists said research *may* get completed September, never said rollout would begin, even thesis findings would published then. Besides research finish September lot things go right, certainity. liscensed cosmetologist, let tell getting spray tanned week anything cheap.

Not much common folk. Playing heartland. Hopefully don’t infect innocent people. Independant:  

Donald Trump may call genius Twitter, spoken statements say otherwise.
An analysis President's first 30,000 words uttered office found Mr Trump speaks third- seventh-grade reading level – lower President since 1929. Mr Trump’s vocabulary grammatical structure “significantly simple, less diverse” President since Herbert Hoover, analysis found.
The comparison based interviews, speeches press conferences every president dating back 1929, compiled online database Factba.se. Analysts Factba.se studied “off-script” remarks 15 men – essentially, everything prepared speeches – compare contrast speaking skills.   think trying screw up. People usually least know name person sex with. people contacting old sexual partners difficult. many people know everyone interact given day. people would need warned Covid exposure. pool people potentially gave Covid far larger harder track. Exactly. bet small % transmission actually occurs outside beach. virus seems like loooves indoors.  Oh yea? phase 2 done? I’m done responding you. You’re either troll, doomed, criminally stupid. Bye. &amp;#x200B;

it's uncommon get vax 2-3-4x.. 

if born US, follow recommended schedule, 

there 5 standard vaccinations get 4x **before** 18 months old.

first one ""prime"" rest ""boosters""

if hurt first time, next couple times either. adults encouraged get them.

teachers get lots every year.

so healthcare medical terms, booster dose extra administration earlier (prime) dose. initial booster injection booster dose re-exposure immunizing intended increase immunity antigen back protective levels, memory antigen declined time. example, shot boosters often recommended every 10 years, memory cells specific tetanus lost function undergone two fights life. One someone spit face. like Kill Bill siren going head. 1:1 blind :( stopped going run outside burpees shows US always ahead tech China steals it. Anti maskers think they’re William Wallace they’re actually Veruca Salt. That's things work. Even different opinion inner EU structure highly democratic needs find common factor. 

Just noting, never heard Horizon idea going anyway. propaganda ""fistfights"", calculated moves Chinese oligarchy. spelled ""spelled"" wrong. Phase 3 ran UK May.

They moved Brazil acknowledged data phase 3 data UK. even bring up. can, volunteer trial.  developing safe effective vaccine, matters proper clinical trials results used determine 2 things. randomly giving vaccine whoever wants without part trial/study work that. it! I’m glad go 24 hour gym. It’s smaller definitely easy find times people aren’t me. Yeah, exactly. need reform money.

Right health care sieve money. pour much money sieve want end going end nothing.

We plug holes. ineffective miss positives also detect false positives? cant usa unified voice instead hundreds different voice.
Usa = ununited states america It’s facebook’s right private company ban people whatever reason especially people would spread disinformation could kill thousands. It’s right protect brand, responsibility human beings. 

Speech never completely free. learned yet? Isn’t taught high school? You’re supporting fake notion. Try threatening people murder see free are. 1-1,000,000: 72 days

Answer: No. 

Wanted make simple all. question is: force projecting on? NATO allies OpFor capable total war 30 years. (Discounting China Russia, cause nukes would rather use tech manipulation get ahead) need MASSIVE fleets air, land sea vehicles, when, 9 times 10, either lay dormant can't used conflict (Hellmand Province like, massive naval batterys useless armoured vehicles bigger mrap would target practice Insurgents rpgs ieds.) last Major total war situation Coalition forces involved with, enemy using Soviet era equipment. What's point overwhelming force enemy markedly inferior equipment training, still can't eradicate opposition completely fuck shit country, people country get pissed (see Weimar Republic info)

But idk, I'm Canadian knows nothing military industrial complex. like ranting internet. ""US general public goes get them"" high Thank comments. told someone office person called VP HR I'm home indefinitely fever get results back. finally feel ease knowing I'm putting coworkers families risk. watching shoulder wear out, ensure energy to, know, start union perhaps. Honestly, better keep coming excuses let us back in. illustrious MIT alumnus Dr. John Trump?! plenty evidence since spreading fine warm countries. confused assertion it’s really hot people go inside AC days.  Yeesh, that’s actually first time I’ve seen clip. good look. I’ll give you, essentially say masks don’t work. seen say masks aren’t necessary “healthy” people. I’ll admit I’m wrong, thanks link Let's forget lithium reserves Bolivia. 140,630 deaths America

On average 1% mortality rate COVID19

If math, means 14 million people infected track total deaths, we're reporting 3.8 million currently infected.

And president said joking slowing testing.... Oh hello, Dr. Gu Wen Kuei. Yes was.  Yeah weak. sure need it, else would build it? 

(Obviously really asking logic point) see studied ex. 1600 Penn... Maybe we'll go next big score... risk low nonexistent. Also, wearing mask normalizing mask-wearing encourages people wear masks. wear mask wherever go? literally lose nothing wearing mask. downside. Mhmm. numbers healthcare system seem wack. privatised corporate hard tell what's coming going. certainly needs seen to, especially previous attempts fix failing part. well think countries world secular like \*yours\*

P.S. gays yeah Saudi follows quran constitution tho u cant legally visit couple, still visit...

also also get arrested hanged gay couple saudi arabia...

i gay friends. Ever seen someone get waterboarded? people get bad go through.

Not spurious, flu extreme outcomes too, right?

Here woman got flu, arms legs .. flu really bad lots people die flu, right? 60,000 odd 2017-18 I'm sure know.

Ok .. imagine last year 2019, nobody even heard word ""COVID"".

And say ""I want stop people dying flu! want stop people arms legs cut off! 60,000 people dead! That's number soldiers died Vietnam! want make sure never happens again!""

So would cool masks social distancing stop flu deaths 2019? .. (dun dun DUN) .. ""Do *want* people die?""

Would cool keeping masks forever, knowing saves people dying flu? Confirm. live valley (central california) large chunk valley's industry comes agriculture farming (CA 5th largest producer world profitable agricultural state country). dont harvest all, country would face food shortage fall winter. matter? responsible says? expert figure head? Personally, think really knows talking about, figure head, expert. not. Masks orders continually come way late. NYC, NJ, Texas, AZ, London, etc put place masks orders weeks months virus naturally declining. 

The virus appear natural ""ceiling"" around 20% give take. Sweden, NYC, NJ, Arizona, Belarus, Brazil, Madrid, etc started leveling hit 15-25% saturation. 7 days since AZ posted gain 4k. He’s wearing much Drakkar Noir hear Wasn’t Arizona sending patients New still trying figure kid stuff out. like rise Yeah, one day someone like see proceed body slam person pavement hospitalize them.  Reminder predictions made “experts” wrong far  Maybe start wearing masks.... enough. Mask requirements came way late really enforced strongly business wants to. imagine lax non-existent rural areas. even happens metros. bad really lockdown like April anything help governor adamant circumstances lock so...it ain't getting better.

The Riverwalk San Antonio packed weekend. Masks required enter restaurants kinda useless places packed nobody sitting like wearing masks. sidewalks narrow packed like 75% people wearing masks brushing other. people tourists small towns across Texas. Thanks telling me. City Philadelphia quarantine list too. Right! can’t rallies he’s using television briefings. Louisiana live Ca. Idk people fighting NY vs Ca. expected **most populated state US**. fixed link mistake. Start over.

And plenty hospitals nearing basically capacity. refusing read news commenting it? Agreed. matters always # dead people, number CONFIRMED cases. Anyone two brain cells obviously tell REAL cases NY likely 10x times confirmed one. 

Months ago much testing plenty asymptomatic people never realized COVID. Careful posting positive information sub. look forward grim news whatever sick reason. Lol, going hilarious. People dropping like flies we're going fed utter bullshit great we're Trump right would go away. shit show. limit many deaths would trigger school shutdown? pediatric deaths deaths? he's smart (lol) he'd keep Fauci current position temper words politics. Let go, suddenly Fauci completely speak mind. administration knows Fauci wildly popular outside MAGA contingent. know end well them. Ah username haha. Well I'm North NJ. bad here. constitutes proof? know that's sort stupid say part problem every time example comes people say problem testing; even cases 7+ tests. 

I suppose get vaccine might definitive evidence one way another. think? Well, fuckin time. Whether message actually gets right-wing media filter another “We’re asking everybody able socially distance, wear mask, get mask. Whether like mask not, impact, they’ll effect need everything get,” said getting used masks would wear one groups use it, gladly,” said. “Anything potentially help ... good thing.” depends reason cuts. second start viewing military spending moral humane lens think stop cutting spending country zero military.

Globally right military budgets absolutely fucking insanity. Living breathing walk among us sit next us subway fucking madness. virus destroying world helping virus destroying other.

You cannot tell vast majority citizens country want destroy people another country. Especially right now. 

The sheer fucking solidarity coming pandemic proving opposite, despite possible differences humans still care, empathize want help humans.

So fuck still need military. blue collar jobs safety rules simple, break one hurts kills you. COVID 19 rules stay safe simple listen reckless, kicks nuts kills you.
Be Blessed enjoy life. Healthcare reform would get us lot closer vision scaling back military.

If got healthcare spending line Germany, we'd saving ~$1.8 trillion year. vaccines fast tracked regulatory process quickly before?  Many people get flu vaccine every year. One might need get covid-19 vaccine every year, every 6 months, every 4 months, long vaccine work. Yeah, there's fishy shit going healthcare system. numbers add right. American education lagging behind rest western world. Truth told, like trying fix plumbing issue scotch tape. plug one hole, two spring up. lied. Literally tell truth Oh, get it, bad. Carry whatever deal is, goon sir. bad data Trump making comments. data must REALLY fucking bad. agree can't say sure we've really done well over. Definitely can't say we're woods.

If recall one original reasons mask mandate prevent low wage employees confront Karens shit possibly even assaulted.

Vermont well mask compliance I've heard though. Probably contributes lot low cases too. always OAN.

And they're always standing back allowed seat. Oh ok think Trump controls these. guy, he's going get it. does, he'll asymptomatic. worst case scenario happen him. worst case scenario always happens best people. means current rate we'll 5 million another 7 days. Crazy.  context stats meaningless. rest countries dramatically reduced spread reporting far less cases deaths now. USA hand regularly setting new records cases steadily increasing deaths well. 

Maybe end pandemic worthwhile statistic, however still biased favour large nations (takes time spread deaths/capita increase quicker smaller nations). Oh. That’s position? call people regardless political afilliation, right? 

Or call Democrats? 

Because you’re “calling mean old libs”, suspected— don’t actually intellectual opinion. You’re contrarian little panty snot. 

Be adult. Grow little flower. Tell us position is. reach. point government cant make blanket decisions prevent health crisis. government supposed do? Im really following logic? Sick winning yet? pathetic thing long took figure out. Nothing new, low income workers getting fucked over. working food paid sick days despite surrounded coworkers customers. Hell suppose find replacement work miss work getting paid call people days try get cover (I shy never missed work). office worker little cube paid sick days need it. anyone needs sick days people close contact working food would make much sense. Jokes them, live alone. lag admissions appear started falling June. true Phoenix's mask order would started week two virus receding. spit someone spat me, thought better fighting apparently it’s severe punching someone eyes law Best America.

Listen first lady once. Name checks large proportion pre-symptomatic transmission would likely reduce effectiveness control preventive measures directly indirectly **initiated symptom onset**, isolation, contact tracing quarantine,and enhanced hygiene use face masks **symptomatic** persons.

The mention masks study pointing viral shedding happens pre-symptomatic waiting symptom onset late quarantine wear mask. consistent wearing masks everyone would include asymptomatic pre-symptomatic people would good thing do. necessarily follow logically.

The ramp testing occurred one rate, simultaneously spread disease ramping another.

We know nature ramp-up infectious disease spread logarithmic.

It's unlikely testing ramped fast disease spread. wear one indoors. risk inhaling covid droplet walking someone low. NSAID however early reports saying yes made worse. guess updated research says thought worse administered worsening cases necessarily related ibuprofen worse case already anyway. guess it, take it. like err side caution general others make choices. I’d suggest avoiding altogether. Acetaminophen ibuprofen same. risk it? Good article read way point still stands. sense hermit. live life. Taking good precautions distancing erring side caution wearing mask least someone could protect themselves.  gotta better lil buddy enjoy too, I’m going create drinking game shortly, wish briefings later day. aren’t enough hypodermic needles existence vaccinate enough people ambulance drives around drops desert cook like raisin It’s like someone told “SLOW TESTING DOWN” moving average deaths also nearly doubled 15 days.

Yep, people realise making america great *for real* comes cost. made 'great' character people, character sacrifice, altruism courage diametrically opposed character long better days... “China” really bothers write whole state name forget re-alphabetize (the data set originally written 2letter code, order reflects that.)  surprise sure, welcome one. AZ's numbers.  think 90 48000 bad number? would amazing true. seems hard believe. People responding properly regardless governor wants do.  kind interesting plan, poisons ground haters act like completely untrustworthy. maybe given big apology became clear masks necessary. would rather right thing wrong reasons nothing spent trillions coronavirus, including $130b direct medical stimulus help hospitals ramp capacity, offset losses related canceled elective surgeries, help pay drugs equipment. put $660b+ ""loans"" ensure Americans kept jobs. gave payments directly short, went way beyond 10% military budget. 3x military budget. we're going still.

If people got way, we'd less deaths hospitalizations.

But people understood this, might ask, ""Well, many people getting infected?""

Work place infections brought home family two driving causes spread. politicians want conversation.

Which Pelosi McConnell tweeting masks instead bankrolling another shutdown  That’s works, that’s you’re getting downvoted. you’re doctor, stick medicine. Let educators decide schools need. Hmm, seems like mistake. Opens charges ""unserious"". silly, lotta silly going around. parodying American attitude saved world WWII (despite sitting last possible moment). don’t really remember taught WWII middle high school tbh. way lower taxes businesses. responsible paying half SS tax amount. sure? hear people talk kids wear mask... 6 year old puts wears effortlessly forgets take get back car. 80% parent influence, 20% kid maturity. sense boundaries you? Look like finally got good deal promote guys wasting breath point. Anyone willing wear mask already wearing one. Anyone willing persuaded unless comes straight presidents mouth. Silly parents Korea solid national contact tracing system key success containment, US feds made like zero mention one since beginning pandemic.

Unfortunately even get system antimaskers would like ""why tracking I've spread germs?? 😤"" Clicked ask exactlythis.. benefits get waiting? mean, certainly mind American visitors, we're neighbors.

Just right now.  Zoom's next killer app: automated WFH surveillance, facial recognition. Optional facebook reddit blocker. [Muh Right, saying really contradicting study lot ways. Masks help, anyone disagrees fool. masks = fewer infections. Totally agree. Masks mostly provide protection everyone else - mask protects you, mask protects me.

**However**

A mask protects nose mouth, slight benefit provides wearer protecting infection apply infections start eyes, increasing overall proportion infections beginning eyes.

Considering early information showing infections begin near olfactory nerve potential cause serious illness, even death, without ever even needing reach lungs all, would think safe bet infections beginning eyes traveling along optic nerve necessarily show symptoms typically ascribed virus right now.

You know virus cause irritation looks like pink eye?

To seems pretty clear ""asymptomatic"" almost certainly misnomer applied still thought respiratory infection, something attack every major organ directly. Symptoms anything respiratory system would likely overlooked, even person experiencing them.

Vertigo, temporary change loss sense smell &amp; taste, pink eye, stroke, organ failure, loss autonomous breathing, brain fog... sorts things caused damage lungs throat, they're caused damage nerves and/or brain (or PTSD cases). went strike Arizona same. thing mass amount teachings literally collapses system strike; can't actually enforce laws since barely anyone wants teacher along underfunded.

I’m Washington u/JayInslee governor problem Governor DeSantis! certainly optimal, people generate droplets loud vocalizations. reduced mouth covered. great, better mask. would thought too, especially last line... nobody Patriotic me, favorite President!"" individual schools ones deciding based circumstance Great, shit China antivaxers anti-maskers, around. also reservoirs bats well cat population. going anywhere. likely remain similar flu, returning year year herd immunity reached, holdouts, going impossible stamp within two years.

I hate planet. America: Gags CDC

Americans: China lying numbers! Entertainment helps people lose minds, turn make likely continue following guidelines. entertainment, people going break guidelines more. Please 10 people following breakdown: 4 aged 16-20, 4 20-24, 2 24, people 16-24 also people 20 (not teenagers). American agrees.  Sounds like viral load. masks prevent substantial viral load out, possible severity illness bad, possibly asymptomatic. Sure, gets article, I’m “deranged stalker”. Sounds fair. guy troll. feed him. Mutations happen...

Think yearly fun flu flu shots People money nowadays buy fucking new window unit brains install one.  part twitter hack? username fits perfectly.  Sending prayers family. Fellow Minnesotan here.   confirm. Masks public shaming strong.  Massholes using powers good.  law degree, even much awareness legal issues. poor redditor sense cents

However, ever oopsie job killed , oh , say hundred thousand, think would happen ?

And difference governor ""embarrassing bad job"", me, potentially famous mass murderer American history Google “stock market republican democrat president” tons discussions. Amazing state matters. Non issue, mean definitely wasn’t saving things rainy something.

But favor wear masks, I’m really odds orange guy.  sure that. Yes. unlimited pot gold. way that's even true anymore. US dollar based gold standard anymore insignificant 1/7. holy hell, stuff presented clean open? Go Fun Yourself. hospital parking fucking murder. wants pay $20-30 going medical procedure? news incredibly misleading. Firstly, vaccine required 2 BOOSTERS decent immune response. Secondly; mean September, meant TRIALS. ONE, absolutely scientists saying public actually going vaccine end 2020 let alone September (DO actually know unethical push vaccine within 6 months public??). scientifically possible establish long-term effects (already side effects include fatigue, headaches) effective Virus. understand people refuse listen multiple EXPERTS consistently said news channel Vaccine take 12-20+ months get public (if even find vaccine).

Remember; quickest vaccine mankind ever achieved took 5 years; Ebola. Lol gonna audit like 50 million paychecks?  Thank you. :-) Murica yes, socialized medicine Europistan, we'll get free least bit funny wildly irrational inconsistent Fox News demographic medical precautions ""their freedoms"".

When comes aborting fetus, pregnant lady's freedoms, ""their"" freedoms irrelevant belief matter.

wait... probably tell coworkers least 5-10 times day fix masks.

The patent rules medicine ridiculous. like think red tape beurocracy leftist idea? 

What mean ""leftist idea""? well understood left go, constricted capitalism already exists, absolutely current US medical system. Lobbying government? falls crony capitalism. 

I agree. What's point? places established ambulance services petitioned newcomers won. That's fact US rank top 10.

😂 They're constantly top 2. Amazing right CDC longer getting numbers. administration manipulates numbers, trump claims mask suggestion made go down. He's predictable fucking idiot. little late try look like hero trump. always tyrant ruined America. Like everything else touched. Burn hell. Yep. working, change it. I've seen sources though article also emphasized September/October idea, one CEO company distributing it. people Oxford suggested millions doses produced think anybody knows sure, really think September ruled out. praying world! least equivalent praying. people's grief 2004 tsunamis took many times worldwide instant?

Nobody gives shit unless happening them.

Normally Karen's annoying, feel bad employee put them. embarrassed family friends.


But pandemic, really need quit scared intervene tell Karen GTFO back employees scared losing jobs.


Like video New York customers told Karen put mask GTFO. would required following good scientific medical advice financially supporting lower middle class workers six months leading election. talking Fauci 60Min interview? IIRC, said general public need wear masks _unless_ sick. Obviously healthcare workers also needed masks. statement prior fully understanding asymptomatic spread. asymptomatic spread became clear, mask requirement changed (as should).

Even now, masks help directions research shows sick person really needs mask. asymptomatic, sick people plus knew around sick people (like healthcare workers) would need masks.

The asymptomatic spread really gotcha triggered rethinking early recommendations. weaselly language So, self-reported. someone could lie us were, live, situation may be. consideration, haven’t seen **large amounts** numbers positive cases coming tags identify parks. It’s $54 order printed book. pdf free, National Academy publications. tax dollars work. would things like Andrew Gillum?

This get approvals medications cover -- neat trick learned Medicaid.

It's probably law somewhere accommodate requests. live Kern County (which republican stronghold), instances would step outside home go grocery shopping, city, everyone mask on. So, somewhat working (hopefully). best brightest, know about. estimates included report whose existence revealed Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance last week, disclosed Daily Telegraph Monday. estimates put together Department Health, Office National Statistics (ONS), Home Office government’s Actuary Department effort quantify collateral damage government’s response virus.


Its estimates assumed 75 per cent elective treatments would cancelled six months would significantly reordered priority afterwards, appears increasingly unlikely. 


However 3.8 million people waiting list elective care May, according NHS figures published Thursday. figure fell 100,000 April widely put drop number people referred testing treatment pandemic. 


Doctors said many vulnerable patients need care avoided checking hospital seeing GP fear catching virus. Data analysis published April UCL experts found urgent referrals suspected cancer dropped average 76 per cent since lockdown.


Last week Oxford University researchers revealed 5,000 fewer heart attack patients admitted hospital March May. hospitals continue operate limited capacity number could soar 10 million end year, according NHS Confederation. 


Experts warned attributing economic downturn entirely lockdown rather virus itself. Many pointed example Sweden, brought light restrictions place full lockdown suffered significantly deaths neighbouring country little economic advantage. Complete insanity. Get vaccine first. tire, who's shuffling tire around? fully realize ""China"" portion phrase far single-most problematic portion think part died little inside fact actually un-ironically used word ""Invisible"" describe something even children understand see microscopic level. safe shop Walmart almost everyone mask on?? getting info from? Marijuana medically legal 20+ states legal recreationally quite few. dont care weed much used to, would love see saying banned life too. Yeah, U.S.A. profit healthcare bad. occurrence novel coronavirus jumped eight cases per 100,000 inhabitants end June, country’s state emergency ended, 27 per 100,000. 

I read ideally it’s 25 per 100k under. headline clickbait. understand everyone anecdotes.

I work hospital health care workers worst masking up.

But people wear masks.

China Italy demonstrated masks less effective lockdowns. Maybe first min wearing it. moisture masks gather less work. means he'll back mocking mask usage tomorrow. use term determine whether virus cause significant immune response. 

Viruses perfect carriers insert genetic material host organism (think gene therapy). virus “vehicle” insert specific gene either loss gain function host’s DNA. 

The titer load critical much virus kills host’s cells.

Edit: forgot mention, parts (genetic material) virus (for lack better terms, bad parts) “edited” out. r/im14andthisisdeep Exactly, know shoe foot would upset even THINK option. People think cotton swab give virus, govt sent mask wouldn’t wear thinking contained virus. much money would take place sick dead child? much would take away grief? old sad tired conspiracy theory pushed, despite overwhelming consensus Covid19 deaths undercounted.

Also highly offensive healthcare professionals sacrificing health trying contain pandemic. shame something conspiracy nuts capable feeling Chinese officials find human human transmission

It say 'find human human transmission', said found **no clear** evidence human human 
transmission. 

It's difference saying 'The suspect commit murder' 'We find enough evidence prove suspect committed murder' really perfect reaction gif this. Yay can't wait discriminated even racist assholes. Ugh Destiny worst. shock wasn’t Bayside. bash her, know happen her, would assistance went higher paying jobs. assume whine want hand outs. No, paid years, want damn job back! Probably rare cases incorrect tests. 

However, legitimate concern. milder human coronaviruses cause lasting immunity reinfect someone couple years last infection. ones get severely sick SARS-2 probably immune life, mild asymptomatic people may end vulnerable again. wut talked doctors dipshit? oh wait probably everything fucking A-OK. Oh mother dying fake news too! right fuck head? 1) That’s works. Decisions made district level, sometimes state level. Florida incompetent governor won’t anything. 
2) school manage social distancing. It’s simply they’re designed for. 
3) matter, socially distanced teaching learning can’t possibly promote best educational practices. Kids can’t collaborate I’m supposed what, stay six feet desks? 

I’m primarily concerned district data atrocious yet still haven’t made call go virtual.

Hope clarifies things.   

The vaccines tested people.

Even given shiniest liability waivers, Pharmas (and stockholders) would still want part hero zero transition creating deadly vaccine would cause. trials thousands people vaccines go wide release.

The problem testing abbreviated, \~ 6 weeks months check side reactions. rare severe autoimmune problems could crop people period. Correct. 100+ posted hoping would finish below. Double-check sources, soldier.
Also could help notice regurgitating erroneous facts instead answering question... I'll stick using johns hopkins data atlantics covid tracker, thank you. sight. mind. 

How many us seen person suffering covid close? 

I think people take plague seriously stomach churning symptoms like pustules bleeding eyes. Disgraceful cults get penny  RIP Arthur. deserved better. obviously know Florida politics Ah yes, vacationing urban elite, national supply chain built trucks, driven quite often rural folks, trips nearest metro areas goods services available rural areas Study suggesting cloth masks may worse.

But, pretend gov allowed declare something 'safe' thus mandatory go horribly wrong well.

Public schools failed you.  Meanwhile US hit 4 million lol used fact minimize danger c19. put perspective. likely 99.96% infected, survive. That's need know chief wait till conservatives Trumpians yelling ""See masks masking real problem, therefore refuse let devil stop god-given breathe system, virus hoax attemtp mind control people 5G take away fReedOm, 'Murica"" yet mean, religious institutions preying people long existed. ye mean anti-mask cretins finally put one stores shut incessant whining? Oof, well maybe explains it. 8 days, makes hard contact trace. 

How test? sister baby said felt like get water nose. 

Hope feel better get (hopefully negative) test results soon! Fucking relax, posted number lower last week appeared hot spot states reported. obviously increased end day. 

Quite straw man built though bud, take deep breath try converse like adult. reactions fairly normal lot vaccines, like pneumonia. really big deal.

The effectiveness definitely concern, said, know. sure, choose optimistic, long take fact end all. concept called (or similar to) infectious dose. threshold amount pathogen needed cause disease, varies species. 100,000 Staph aureus, 100 E. coli O157 spark notes example. Bacteria viruses behave differently disease cycles hardly comparable, takeaway lower dose host starts with, better chance host 1) recognizes pathogen causes catastrophic damage 2) eliminates pathogen quickly.

Wearing mask may 100% eliminate threat, absolutely dampen dosage. viral shedding portion disease, dramatically lowers infectious spread asymptomatic light case happens community.

Edit expansion:

A low viral dose guarantee less severe case, every body different, immune response different turn. still better chance fighting exponential amount more.

I've couple chats radiology friends parallel avoiding viral exposure radiation are. Time, distance, shielding, relevant areas limiting exposure. Stay home much can, wear mask, keep distance.

As far long immunity last, ultimate question 2020, still developing ways accurately quickly determine immune response (the IgG may heard about). usual coronaviruses impart longstanding IgG level, defeatist news front, immune system also funny thing called anamnestic response, detectable levels antibody drop threshold, stimulated back almost frightening efficiency. hopeful wikicoma leave with.

Cases lower today compared last week’s Monday, deaths. god help ever Since saying read article I'm consumed Dunning-Kruger, I'll leave you. economist linked, he's clarifying further. found little bit drilling down, little bit deeper maybe people want to, know, old people susceptible coronavirus. value lives young people’s lives?*


*Kip: Well, don’t think deep dive actually since think thinking age distribution something you’d want government policy make sure you’re thinking right way. Government agencies generally don’t make distinctions based age, except people short remaining periods life. that, instead using value statistic life, saying people’s lives worth $10 million case agencies, nine $10 million, you’d use value statistical life year. you’re losing year life cases month life, you’d want scale numbers current numbers value statistical life, you’re order $500,000, still fairly large number, 500,000 whole lot less 10 million. yes, age distribution could matter, might people seriously ill they’re nineties long life expectancy sick, they’re seriously ill short period remaining life. it’s age, it’s future life expectancy you’d want look take account.*

I aware article. interview. calling article. 

Secondly - never find quote saying shut shut going forward. I'm merely talking economic cost life. again, strawman. Also, survey conducted March, data much sparse virus ferocity. Though, sure much changed front. 



As far ""sane government"" I'm inclined agree. 




I'm still waiting 8,000,000 figure, citing 10,000,000 cited article. stand corrected fact claims average life costs 9-10 million. apologies end, still skeptical methods isolate risk premium construction work determine figure. Simply think construction workers apply job whole necessarily calculate - yeah - one ten thousand die. I'll take 300 premium one ten thousand risk (at point time) job market may run value, know accurate is.

At end day, original comment pretty much correct, we're losing average life due COVID, thankfully. learned something new, thank you. tragic anyone pass due COVID. Good them. Probably still easier almost anywhere else. able go anywhere ~~without heckled,~~ eternity.

""General public need masks, front line workers need lots masks.""

""There mask shortage front line workers.""

Use fucking head. OBVIOUSLY masks important, one would giving tiniest shit they're short supply. Everyone brain known masks work, that's people close personal COVID patients need them, want get near anyone, also really one.

But also, March April, man.. kinda need mask much. week grocery store chance exposed. yeah, risk incredibly low back people general public following lockdown rules.

This obvious. I'm saddened people can't realize actually desperate situation appeal, saying, ""Please, people! Save masks doctors nurses dealing 100s COVID patients day.""

Uh, talking homelessness, reply point. 4th time now, landlord lives home/apartment complex rents of, get kicked bank cant pay mortgage. means homeless. cant pay mortgage renters dont pay him. part complicated? original comment simply ignorant.

Other people already successfully argued angles too. simply ignoring every aspect. Lol true. time seen someone wear mask store cafe inside Dunkin Donuts. like ordered mobile app, came quickly picked order left. wearing mask, chin covering face. guy got mad looks way even though inside maybe 20 seconds Maybe ask church leaders pray covid away🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️

Honestly kind church thinks okay put people's kids/teens danger like this!? think exempt virus they're Christians?

Stupid. Probably read orginal interview. showing concern, frontline workers ill absolute ly needs mask shortage. also shows concern mentioning mask could give people false sense complete protection potential fiddling around mask. 

""But point early March, CDC recommended conserving face masks, short supply, health care workers COVID-19 showing symptoms. So, Fauci gave answer line CDC recommendations time.""

""LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it."" know pointless think it, always wish they've done way sooner... 1918 pandemic

I agree, unfortunately everyone sees way forcing won’t work. 

This isn’t really comparable road regulations taxes. already consensus society things essential enforced government. people might complain know they’ve basically got accept it. even close sort consensus mandatory vaccine, especially new one. 

Also, health risk following policies. risk vaccine might low, zero. large number people anti-vaxxers genuinely worried speed developed. 

While Oxford Vaccine looks safe it’s candidate. happens shit vaccine rushed market Trump wants ‘win’? happens it’s clear shit mandatory nationwide vaccination side effects disaster? happens people really bad reaction die mandatory vaccine? people didn’t want vaccine? They’ve basically murdered state.

Given prevalent anti-vaxx ideas US it’s actually enforceable anyway. couldn’t imprison many people given attitudes would almost certainly turn extremely violent. know it’s fucking absurd firefight could start vaccine that’s reality live in. People already died masks, vaccines another level people. 

This would agitate anti-vaxxers, gun fanatics probably recruit cause. wavering matter would grudgingly accepted vaccine refuse due abuse government power probably go full crazy subject.

That's thing...people like bash federal gov response, mandating things...the states claimed fed gov mandate states rights. Federalist system governance states retain power domestic matters. It’s really governors state legislators input health departments.

29 states mask mandates:

Alabama (7/15), Arkansas (7/20), California (6/18), Colorado (7/17), Connecticut (4/10), Delaware (4/28), DC (5/6), Hawaii (4/20), Illinois (5/1), Kansas (7/3), Maryland (4/18), Maine (5/1), Louisiana (7/13), Kentucky (5/11), Massachusetts (5/6), Michigan (6/18), Montana (7/6), Nevada (6/24), New Jersey (4/8), New Mexico (5/6), New York (4/17), North Carolina (6/26), Oregon (7/1), Pennsylvania (4/19), Rhode Island (5/8), Texas (7/3), Virginia (5/29), Washington (6/26) West Virginia (7/6).

For practical purposes mask mandate two thirds states bulk population. 

New York New Jersey two states early mandates April - 48,369 Covid deaths top two deaths per million people. two states account one third deaths, yet mandated masks ahead states. 

I support masks wear one consistently public.

Compare something like Sun (I think, might dailymail). bullshit actual news. wanna compare BBC Indian news channel, would say compare NDTV. course trump tweaking numbers 😂😂😂 think anyone still wedding anytime year idiot point. wouldn’t go, would tell friends selfish reckless dumbasses. Well, r/coronavirus, shit Florida truly gets dumber every day. believe it, 7th largest district country, they’re still talking going back person. 14 day testing average 16.16%, according one source data saved favorites. 

My district town hall meeting today and, apparently, student tests positive virus, DON’T negative virus go back; “symptom free.” Yeah, read correctly. requiring negative tests students; sure teachers, given stingy they’re worker’s comp, it’s looking good.

I’ve concerned, never terrified now. Please, please, please let local board vote online learning. want see students, teachers, staff die this. Shouldn’t America virus now? know originated China, it’s certainly propagated America loss cell function / numbers 

Do think cells killed HIV-like? COVID-19 proudly endorses Trump re-election. Trump created sanctuary nation, reduced testing, discouraged masks. COVID-19 could better friend Trump. Chi aint Portland. Philly, D, NY. Dem boys bussing. takes get momentum going. 2A black militias forming prepared also.  ""Coronavirus threat others alright sounds like crack release Canadians smug sense superiority comes COVID, throw reality window. Science Probably due Donald Trump.

/s to... think. mess :( wouldn’t use three weeks. 30 days probably better. new daily cases last 30 days. said anything unemployment? think federal government send people checks.   People really really sick got go hospitals away trenches whereas people early version stay trenches. trenches deadly better chance surviving deadly Spanish Flu another week trenches kids could also lasting chronic disease. really way early say they'll fine degree certainty. NBA reported 0 new Covid cases since July 13th. Seems like bubble strategy working. NBA might good Wait...what? run seats virtual class?

At point pandemic government funded program E learning K-12. much could cost? hundred million dollars tops?  Let’s see happens second week training camp hope lessons learned this. (In US.)  Same. I’ve 2 panic attacks last week. last time happened 14 years ago. feel absolutely helpless I’m terrified Same. idea going happen gods wish picked new career path. new career path atrhis point, pursue. I'm fucked weeks... would thought 11.5% chronic unemployment, massive evictions rise fascist state would cause uptick violence? explanations though, exhausted them.   Yea, antivaxx people, blanket state old people won’t want get sounded way me. people know 60, much hoping vaccine.  Yes, lesser degree HIV due receptor expression. Floridian left state 11 years come back will... shit.. find out, let know. I've infuriated months. It’s WAY 9/11 level catastrophe. 9/11 killed 3000 Americans. We’ve lost 45 times number Covid, it’s still much ongoing. People choice. People think theyd better unqualified person teacher qualified virtual. Also, school already unqualified teachers prepandemic due unable fill spots new thing Please explain why, I've merely said Universal Basic Income enough information make assessment. many implementations UBI. thought Democrats wasted money. riding past bible camp N.E. Washington state, fast glance kids without masks crowd. 


Thought many parents weeks get notices. parents brain dead can't let mass amounts Americans pandemic. Ireland, Americans fleeing hard-hit areas taking quarantine seriously. risk us allow anyone - except dire circumstances. studies put 40-60 percent. 

And even might underestimate. 

The new study South Korea today shows infected city, caught 8 percent infections, incredible testing contact tracing did. means 92 percent may asymptomatic. talking medical friends. It’s mostly old people dying (over 80). Thus, it’s deadly population. 

I mentioned Dr Ioannidis, despite buffoonish characterization, one top epidemiologists country. He's charge. problem, there's problem, lack leadership incompetency. know still impugns leadership competency.  guy obviously gets news Facebook, friend, friend, friend get swabbed magically tested positive covid19. he's trying get supporters wear masks. issues

* able shop around

* Regulations competition / crony capitalism

* Red tape bureaucracy leftist cities

We're stuck shitty middle area neither side wants budge

And I'd argue Americans give money need otger country world Stay business, government! first: MONEY PLEASE. I'm English I'm opposite, think something Brits proud of. happened Wales I'd still see something Britain proud of, see point like that. last week cases rocketing, changed data reported, hospitalization down. Seems fishy 
My uncle sort church/cult. nothing - nothing - say make believe virus real problem. 

He’s Florida they’re still large church meetings. masks course, mark Satan. God stronger virus. Etc. time show symptoms, get scheduled test, actually get test, get results... hasn’t everyone household infected already? Yes, starting think thing. seem deliberately riling sides different ways. 
But why?? ""LA County reports new high coronavirus hospitalizations"" Remember upset were, paused second acknowledge it, lost 9/11 amount people whole country Covid? individual states waaaaaaaaaaaaaay past numbers, never mind ""recovered"" people never same. sad. looks fellow Americans kid mother yelling half German/half English same. (I called ""Genglish"".. two year old saying ""ESSEN!"") well written English first language. Good luck, well!  Grecian 2000. ""subtle"" effect.  Christ. Treating family like lepers. Come Newfoundland Labrador - got tons space. Weather's bit iffy beer good. We're broke could use tax revenue. She'll probably denied life insurance also, willingly exposing yourself. Doesnt cover simple flu infections recommend survive pandemic then? According California public health: +6,846 new cases Yes! Tell yes!  would find surprising. Check graph [Consumer Confidence consumer confidence indicator provides indication future developments households’ consumption saving, based upon answers regarding expected financial situation, sentiment general economic situation, unemployment capability savings. indicator 100 signals boost consumers’ confidence towards future economic situation, consequence less prone save, inclined spend money major purchases next 12 months.

Unsurprisingly, absolutely tanks 2020. UK law wear masks public transport. Barbers wear masks experience I've heard extending customers too. shops wear masks yet (will starting 24th) one-way systems place screens cashiers. first weeks opening shops also operated 1 1 policy seems now. experience though still quiet streets. also slowly unwinding restrictions amount people meet indoors/outdoors. 

I know compares California. yet currently top post sub almost 40k upvotes. one member household infected, it’s likely spread others. Fauci sub Instructions unclear Omg can't even LMFAO

A ""housed landlord"" ""housed"" HOUSE.

If tenants pay rent, landlord can't pay mortgage, bank takes house them. previously ""housed landlord"" becomes homeless. house = homeless. 

The kind homeless tenants. Neither housing. bank took house, landlord pay, tenants pay. 

How old you? sincerely need know. I've never met adult zero idea housing works. used live Wisconsin. Alot people, especially leaders, still think 1955 there. think weird asian bird flu magically gone soon. need worry wear stupid mask. 

Glad got fuck there. public shamings need happen LOT MORE. economy, think parents work home rather burning gas sitting traffic, sitting desk 8 hours office.  Obligatory down-vote, since expecting it.

""every doctor know"" definition anecdotal evidence. top health experts country saying terrible mistake.  Yes. Covid seems relatively easy control masks half-assed social distancing. differences US rest world (and state state differences) make sense otherwise.

Masks mean much stronger economy fewer deaths. could probably even reopen schools without controversy masks normal beginning summer.  I'm suburbs southwest USA. see many people walking masks imagine downtown different story. Actually usually see many people walking even cooler early morning hours. make easy keep distance happen upon someone else walking. I'm ""won't get *rushed* vaccine several years stage 4 trial (when general population gets new medication/vaccine) I'm healthy 30 year old"" group.

Seems bigger risk COVID take totally untested vaccine honestly. me. many, vaccine probably less risk.

I'm anti-vax all, even got HPV vaccine male. I'm anti-rushed medicine I'm otherwise perfectly healthy. Right, fucking choice? delusional. literally can’t decide go work. 

I WANT GO BACK. still bills pay, teachers kids? refuse go livelihoods ruined. 

The solution state mandate schools virtual. mad them, people need pay bills Well That’s kinda point. skeptical numbers (good bad) reported data definitely suspicious. inverse even worse. Sending kids school reopening means even dead even longer country wide covid recovery period already longest worst country damn planet people born bottom 1/5th country 60% escape bottom 1/5th. Similarly 60% people born top 5th slide position. pretty decent income mobility. Lots dirt poor people get education make something themselves. Pretty easy mini split system. window unit required. traveling risk we're definitely letting James Harden back court. awful, especially truck drivers move around surely spread without possibility contract trace. Thanks sharing unsafe you. 

I often think covid spread ""essential"" US-CANADA travel scared Canadian living major city near border. far better option death causing death others. I'm sorry flat justification teacher go back work current conditions.  bad enough government working us teachers refusing consider alternative blind obedience.  never going end continue follow bad guidance politicians forcing us. got stop even means financial ruin loss career.  one's life worth that. Hmmmmm “If outbreak occurred!”  mask catches virus, stops breathing in?  horseshit! mask gets full virus. thank goodness none gets through, needless say mask constantly touching tour lips mouth. got lefties saying BBC right leaning rights saying left leaning. 

So basically BBC fairly bias-free It’s mandatory Washington. that’s least 7 million people required wear mask. Idk state individually, problem labeling “the United States” it’s one entity one controlling government misleading ignorant. 50 different states government home 330 million Americans. think rest world, especially Reddit, conveniently forget fit USA hate circlejerk. start spouting facts now. Might get bunch folks butthurt. worked home respiratory field 15-20 years. many people wear mask wrong touch face crazy. smart people washing hands frequently would job. Instead hipsters full beards wearing mask looks like hair net karen walking chad masks pulled nose wipe eyes.  important , can’t wait bunch middle aged conservative Karens call bullshit. Yikes. That’s insanely poor turnaround time. KU doctor? They’re running tests here, running 24 hours. I’m teacher haven’t heard I’ll required get tested going back. kids potential danger risk colleagues, someone who’s 31 good health, I. common, know people who've done it. Right option, when/if border opens again. know obesity risk factor, I'd imagine correlation based overall health obese people rather weight risk factor. think comparing athlete's BMI average American makes sense. problem is, new science help anyone still refuses wear mask goddamn stupid minds changed point.

*”Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.”*

-George Carlin Haven’t thought book forever I'm reminded central air. call anti-maskers 

Or pro-disease think anti-masker negative Hot take: people think requiring masks infringement rights: Really going like government's going end 40% population one area infected time. Haha load. CDC estimated 10x many people infected confirmed cases. Since definition asymptomatic identified cases also asymptomatic pretty reasonable 95% total infected asymptomatic. Whether plus minus percent doesnt change fact pretty much everyone gets virus symptoms. genuinely makes happy. earth *I* making Democrat versus Republican thing? Never said help focus masks utmost important thing misguided. witnessing Cantillon Effect. source that? I’d like read   1) stock market economy

2) QE started 2008 response GFC, none relevant comparisons

3) Investing times would yield massive gains stayed market years mark beast!!!! That's economies tend fall, gradually first, cliff. takes one mistake. worth risk. Cool, thousands mysterious pneumonia deaths way higher running average last 9 years every single state aren’t diagnosed covid-19. 

So theory overdiagnosing fell flat right there. Unless “mysterious pneumonia” new plague happen coincide exactly covid-19 happen. Makes sense me. think hypothetical idea, also remember reading price tag $1-10B range develop technology. That's remember though.

EDIT: 60-65 patients 7 Javed Akram disclosed **rate recovery combination three drugs highest 86pc. second highest recovery rate 75pc azithromycin. overall recovery rate patients, given medicines, 73.1pc rate recovery without medicines 27pc patients remained Corona-positive even two weeks taking drug. patients given medication, 33pc remained Corona-positive even two weeks.**

EDIT: show shorter viral detection period, may statistically significant since numbers would larger numbers deaths arm (?)

EDIT: arms balanced similar comorbities ? gave none ? 73pct recovery rate means 27pct mortality rate, means untreated patients well going hospital Italy, Spain, UK, US. However age demographics Pakistan/Indian subcontinent younger, would give lower mortality rate overall, however hospital admitted patients would tend older (?) - age distribution admitted patients vs UK/US/Spain/Italy UHS VC added recovery rate first week research 33.5pc second week, increased PCR test used basis research. **He said total four deaths reported study. Three deaths occurred groups receiving single medicine, one death occurred group receiving combination hydroxychloroquine azithromycin.**


EDIT: lot statistics ie 1 death vs 3 control arm - maybe enough compare across arms, indications ie severity, shorter hospital stay could bigger numbers amenable Akram made clear study still progress **it would involve around 9,500 patients completed**. added Rs30m spent research far, university collected resources donations.

I'm pretty sure dexamethasone. corticosteroid decreased mortality among ventilated patients third among oxygenated patients 20%.

I'll tell get first though going essential workers millionaires congress government say this? Where’s evidence? that’s shady hell. Nobody saying don’t go doctor don’t buy food though...? fair easy properly describe happening keep going back forth, neighboring cities counties wildly different restrictions, enforcement non-existent, 1/3 population thinks hoax. State (very reasonable) opinion get downvoted, great job Reddit Got tested today bad headache yesterday fever last night. fever gone headache mostly gone fingers crossed don’t it. 

The test wasn’t bad thought would be, one nostril. wrong thinking usually both? people voice online young, medical standpoint. 

The virus predominantly kills old people. Old people aren’t protesting FB/Reddit (Medically ‘old’ we’re talking 65+). 

I’m saying *doesn’t* kill young people, you’re young die COVID, probably should’ve played lottery week before. 

That’s people don’t care. ones come ignorant think/know they’ll fine, they’re careless.  true hero RIP guardian NYT two liberal (and biased) papers there. However, also much respected two little Florida papers PBS. believe want, I'm obviously going change mind. fool least questioning timing connections Biden son China.

In case Coronavirus:

1. Finding anyone who's tested positive Coronavirus contact with.

2. Getting touch people know they've potentially exposed Cornavirus.

3. Asking/instructing contacts self-isolate 14 days point contact

If done quickly effectively, stop people might early stages Coronavirus (where they're infectious yet symptomatic) infecting others.

Without vaccine, getting number cases using contact tracing (in conjunction measures) keep numbers pretty much way experts think get life back people strongly?

Some people idiots. Contact tracing arguably important step pandemic response, it’s notify contacts people tested positive let know need get tested. 

Without contact tracing, it’s impossible control cases keeping businesses open. Bullshit. Yeah, hear you.

The problem asshole like trump could abuse it, times free speech goes general safety public (like anti mask anti vax) immediately shut down. 

Unfortunately asshole could argue birth control abortion goes safety health public shut to. really, anti mask opinions silenced. think though? several candidates already mass produced.  - countries offer residency large investment, others offer BC, classes back session month June online classes run April May. dry-run things might look. 25% children came school one day, 4 days kids made week, teachers one day continue online lessons. kids school, meant distance, wash hands frequently, etc. 
I'm high school kids hanging immediately next one another within hour arrival. friends teach elementary, kids good class constantly corrected, lunch recess free-for-alls. Instead distancing, school gave made ""no touching"". Small kids understand it, anxiety got scared come school all. generation trauma traumatic event raises awareness mental health. step-dad rejected psychology solution problems (but eventually accepted might problem), failed recognize abuse causes harm. father insisted beating kids makes better children. every generation societies understanding human suffering grows. issue ACs blowing air around, think. means 6 feet distancing longer sufficient. companies care people government does.  always count Americans right thing - they've tried everything else.

Get head putins ass raging nationalist. live like 500km away grew up. Sometimes hear folks months, come make call two place sleep, eat party. Imagine much talk know anything months, sometimes years. 

The whole ""staying connected"" kinda illusion begin IMO. wish town Northern BC would get idea. wife store day plus couple people masks.

Now cases health region people Province collected Okanagan Canada Day. sense duty obligation extends beyond able conceive of. girlfriend NHS nurse, albeit hospital didn’t end sharp end UK crisis — whatever reason region hasn’t hit deeply others.

During g early stages, fear self preservation suggested could leave job, would manage would easily find reemployment crisis. laughed me. simply wasn’t option her. 

Whether attitude would shifted things became much worse questionable, position able soak financially, combined sense duty self sacrifice assumed nurses I’ve met, questions nursing staff don’t quit. ""My party's future base already homeschooled believe Earth 6,000 years old, fuck public school kids."" hard swallow. Empathy needs basic human trait  Well yes everyone else campus. pretty much everyone police everyone type thing. people know age physical distancing wearing mask think change school starts. Thank words encouragement stressed Oh right, June. recency issue: days late June may still reported.

England issue counting nobody ever recovers. number June covid deaths still high. Thanks

I think physical defenses mucosal tissue localize delay infection. Lower respiratory infections spread faster greater circulation likely become systemic.

That makes sense lower viral load results asymptomatic cases. Bc number cells infected irrelevant cycles. location type cell critical Smokin' wacky tobaccy again.  trying ""defeat China?""

Do always need someone ""defeat?""

Jesus Christ. Wow. many illegal things going beyond reasoning. Prisoner labor without pay international law, since 50s. levels criminal negligence wanton neglect appalling. Something needs done this, makes Arkansas look like 3rd reich Warsaw Ghetto. Throw Covid well, nightmare, literal living hell.

I locked time, long long time ago, nothing violent anything (I bought laptop stolen - didnt know. Got hit conspiracy 5 years it). knew plenty people wrong place wrong time made 1 bad decision (like myself) locked result. Many people boat, deserve die inadequate, racist, brutal DOC.

I know doctors, psychologists, economists, professors met prison, functioning well professions. Model citizens, past nothing bad memory, price paid full. sure people reading too, many people like broadcast dirty history, huge fraction US incarcerated before. 

Acting like prison towards inmates 1-inhumane 2-criminal 3-shows us control Evil people general, morals whatsoever. want corrections institutions ran people dont understand ""Correct"" effort urge good human being? Probably not, definitely case.

I hoping stuff coming gets government officials something it, people bring sort stuff addition wanton police murders Blacks minorities inspired BLM movement. one aspect systemic racism inherent every part government. Didn’t state masks don’t protect wearer rather people come contact with? don’t masks labels indicating don’t provide protection viral infections? I’m genuinely confused. case anyone curious, study making news weeks ago, new study. undergone peer review. still issues methods stuff, generally speaking, people agree main results.

It possible huge mortality benefit ventilated population may replicable, steroids offer modest benefit. Well suddenly I’m favor it. received results school district.. 75% parents want kids go back free child care.. want ignore inconvenience. Teachers area also want schools opened (very republican county). guess changes impacts personally.. Yeah actually, point comment all? supposed despise *more* obese/white/multigenerational/merch-wearing? think sufficient despise choosing go Disney pandemic. NYC every couple days 1/2 population Texas. per capita rate death 1/10th much Texas right NYC. First all, reason people criticize many activities, eg bars indoor dining, people shit like wearing masks. Second all, something like beach theme park would pretty safe well regulated local, people travel extremely long distances go them. Third all, activity affects everyone, like mask mandate opening indoor bars dining, going much bigger hazard protests. protests participated small number people compared something like indoor dining bars.

So yea, people definitely catch covid going protest, it’s manageable number compared indoor dining bars. YVW Remote distance elbow bump. ;) realize many know someone died flu respritory issues right? Tuberculosis, far, far higher chance knowing someone died that. Yet lock panic like end world media shoved throat? 2 years ago South FL many hospitals expanded ICU flu season influx including three me. Oh that's right, panic, media agenda, hell 95% people likely even know that, continued living lives normal. Two nurses street alone Covid ICU wing two hospitals, actually bad think, heck back normal hours including 1 day like started, pretty interesting ""record cases"", think people would shocked small actual covid, truly sick ones, wings. beds taken issues, accidents, surgeries, health/sickness general treatment. 

That's say fake anything like that. say'ing, look picture well. completely delusional think people stay locked long. Funny people think account issues, rise suicides, record amount domestic violence incidents South FL straight two cop friends, 15-20+ years force never seen amount calls respond domestic violence right now. kids raised fucked situation regarding schooling now, friends social interaction like normal school.

Let alone basically verge financial collapse we're whole. consult secondary markets deal financial syndications, people idea truly ugly around.

You look complete perspective. hope right, financed part package cutting funds allocated fighting climate change, I'm afraid good end moron thr people low income areas smart enough wear masks though.. Even protesters/looters wearing masks know I'd say normal middle class. mother opera singer Eurovision father actor. They're probably 1% probably fairly wealthy.

It make accomplishments less impressive though. become famous money. went viral UN speech. understand, shitting young girl simply trying make people aware badly we're treating planet, home probably ever have. 

What's that? Can't work? Looks weird know, grammars always worst subject. (Do favor, look book comment wrote 😜) Thats substantive response.

What standard determining reinfection occured? Makes sense.  Kind like destroying anyone thinks 'all lives matter'. comes together devaluation human life. I'm curious, large comfortable seating areas Starbucks region? ones near like 4 tables uncomfortable wooden seats enough outlets charge stuff. I've Starbucks' comfortable/larger/more open mostly bigger cities US. Great!!! takes responsibilities too, particularly one crowd gets infected game. medical board thanks you. Link published peer reviewed double blind study finds safe effective.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll waiting patiently. Florida weird reporting Tuesday lower parts week. idea why.

This number *up* last week (9194 vs 9440). Thankfully much, it’s there. thought everyone household supposed isolate 14 days two negative tests days row going back out! living America better say Venezuela North Korea quality life isn’t better Norway Denmark girl truly one heroes. Eventually Karens stay home order everything online, good arnt improvement. higher last Tuesday record hospitilisations remind subreddit on. people probably even click link began typing, much less read link. keep making excuses. 

Who addressing?  airborne.  


NYT: ""The Coronavirus Airborne Indoors, W.H.O. Says

The agency also explained directly people without symptoms may spread virus. acknowledgments come sooner, experts said.""

See: actual fuck? Sometimes people get handful carry over. Sometimes finish year two days, sometimes use vacation day. easier move New Zealand. Even amass 3 million first so. Same, wasn’t expecting next surge September temperatures started cooling UV indexes weren’t high, completely forgot southern half country can’t socially distance outdoors 100+ degrees humidity. still higher last Tuesday higher positivity rate. Last time checked blue team trying stop virus, red team telling people virus hoax, masks activate hidden coronavirus, virus magically disappear own. again, repeat, CNN biased pro-death team, fully support them.

Also, asked question FL focus news reports (not CNN). gave clear answer: FL 2.3 times many cases per capita CA, yet completely glossed legitimate answer. narrative watch briefings...... That’s good know. pass information her. soon knew left house stayed elsewhere. know many people option. amused project turning boxes full masks turning around saying they're sheep explaining need mask. course they're worried covid since flu.  mean tell $130 buy textbook every quarter isnt used wisely towards institution Yet cared 2 died Ebola 4 died Benghazi. people literally care they’re told care about. ""The slowdown rent growth severe high end rental market, lower-priced rentals saw rents going markedly. likely demand high-end rentals dropped dramatically demand lower-priced properties.""

This means average nationally, people struggle affording rent pushed people money. title makes seem like good thing renters, really good thing money pay smaller places. Er, Figures dumb people would build new goalposts every time instead installing wheels. muh rights freedumb! Hey, least rich life this, matter bad fucks up. Purposeful infection low dose reasonable, we're risk-averse approve anything like that.

A problem plan *best* dose one *so* low can't tell infected. dose low, anything. might end infectious. not. can't tell. would safe visit someone? Yet someone mistakes cruelty lack empathy willingness make tough decisions history ultimately vindicates. Dude, ""Crazy legs"" thing. PLENTY ways insult dumb piece shit. Picking one thing control good look. checks debit card era? debit card era completely unmarked envelopes. one visa debit card attached one sheet paper must stopped matter what. Depends strict state legally make really. won’t see business activity “hey need beach cuz BUSINESS”. it’s really state. 

That said, I’m also avoiding big groups staying home much possible. Started ordering food online ship purchases made online. 

I personally think need stricter measures, people care little others end extremely poor response. live apartment 2 people - we'd turn AC completely install 3 4 separate window units, guess.

The heat index 110 yesterday :( real question here, type mask? someone provide studies disposable ones even cloth ones. someone believe masks help world trying cheat them.

Ik can't talk logic people I'd like try Here’s latest case/death charts Texas, running 7-day averages. spike 7-day average deaths seems particularly ominous. told one point could walk place like ""hey want job"" they'd like ""Sure"" like what????

It also expected ppl leave parents house men working women married think around 100 years ago. considered financially feasible. Funny boost economy single generation change expectations. Close. Covid deaths top greatly increased excess deaths year compared time period last 5 years. every 1 person died covid, 4-5 died “pneumonia” “heart attack”. It’s measured thousands many areas, 5-year average measured hundreds time period.

Only looking deaths “due covid”, obscuring large part real picture. also native birds could probably kill eat full grown man unfortunately tasted like chicken. “Pro-life” never fetus. runs fine establishments? Names please. Damn, that's kind deal breaker it? boosters can't used vaccine maintain protection couple years? understand point truly wish people country didn’t things put others danger, truly wish government competent empathetic realise problem ran deeper expected. happy say everyone uses mask here, mandated. hope helps governments realise people sometimes don’t want break laws recommendations they’re unruly. they, leaders, done better job ensuring minimum quality life, wouldn’t devastating, that, agree you. Thank explaining point view reading mine. wish best health. Depends ""us"" statement. entire planet needs it. seems problem here, ha ha. can't waste time worrying stupid fucktards there. They'll get vaccine won't. least people ready pandemic get vaccinated get back jobs without worry much. Hopefully lot businesses job sites require vaccinated work help too. 

But yeah, may awhile herd immunity even though I'd love see vaccine soon, feeling it'll take longer optimistic predictions. Hopefully I'm wrong though! Seems bit presumptuous say cases declining.

4% drop 7 day moving averge peak nothing. Testings mess there. Week+ long turnarounds, pretty high positivity rate.

Cases flattened bit, infections? Hard know whats actually going on.

They might decline, know awhile. proof besides ""say-so""

*Get absolutely dumpstered lmao.*

Word advice, chat shit things know nothing nationalist *who simply anything claim ""hacked""*

fyi australia vaccine progress absolutely things worth hacking arent far ahead three Russia hack Chinese branch?

Because russia terrified china turning it.

Make sure lick clean crumbs around putins swollen asshole. guess comment aims EUs US' debt based economy?! 

Oh boy, want know chinese' books, think payed boom? Foreign capital investments prepped like crazy, private industrial debt track match west's. Also one hell real estate bubble growing. retirement castastrophe one child policy leave disbalance retiree/work force balance. could go here, think China magical wonderland sunshine rainbows comes economic growth dead wrong. send kid school conditions upon insistence idiots like this. Every day read news, thankful live Germany US, German government shown common sense care people. 

This asshole ask happen somebody loses kid virus, ""kids must go school"" reason, measures taken prevent transmitting virus. 

As person, forgiving. father, absolutely hell pay somebody puts kid danger. Temperature checks catch people starting get symptoms, perfect certainly better nothing Well yeah, shit jobs taken black people 50s, american ideal. I'm dealing person like work convinced he'll chipped tracked gets vaccine. Also supports NRA really reason likes stuff do. Also hates Cuomo know why. wish work would fire people taking vaccine proven safe. Also got argument believe mask science said psychological thing. WTF! 

Surprisingly Trump-train since day one. Loves guy! Whoops. yes. bad.

If look ""deaths per million"" looks like -

Texas (29m, 4,100 deaths) = 140 deaths per million

Canada - 235 deaths per million

Ireland - 355

The USA overall - 435

UK - 667

Do see difference?  even specific Disney. everyone working thought least back minds.

Unless ignorant reality situation, that's different issue. understand feeling stressed, like lots people.

Better take here. happened “I want everything close normal Christmas” aged well fine wine...  Plot twist: Amazon® Tribes® actually people talking think Santa's Elves. North Pole actually fulfillment center northern Brazil. told wrong location want anyone find it. Well fuck. bad impeachment work either. Honestly pandemic made realize dependent work due debt. I’m trying change budget pay house quickly possible buy new cars. Living debit free within means would allow stop working terms, hunker needed.  mentioned reply Facebook one targeted advertising I'm sure mean propaganda. propaganda done specific groups would similar subreddits? news people get Facebook.

It's definitely productive see worse reddit sense, though saying someone whose Facebook groups/pages media like university knows. mean polio took 40 years... ""...In today's edition 'No Shit News'..."" few, mostly severe respiratory conditions neuromuscular conditions. 

My diaphragm weak wearing mask add later extra resistance makes breathing even weaker..... COVID would make million times worse! 

I go fit enough able wear mask, might limit time spend becoming weak, that’s bad thing either! 

Generally you’re sick enough able wear mask probably reconsider going all.  1. story nearly month ago now. 

2. literally linking ""media source"" try prove point media sources telling us something. 

3. FTA: ""It’s clear, though, respondents wore masks every time left home, came close contact others."" Lol dont know people downvote sort questions. Noone ever reads damned articles also worry Well based people daily life I'd say chances almost guaranteed Feels like diet coke 2 quarter pounders switch reported % positive include re-tests? people tested 3 times count 3 tests. thought saw somewhere % positive relatively unchanged included influx repeat testers. astroturfing is. 

Astroturfing making sponsored organised movement appear grassroots movement. 

Like many anti-lockdown protests US bussing ""protestors"" National Smokers Alliance set Big Tobacco. going Disney right now? even fun measures place? Sous chef hotel focusing banquets. feel that. I've closing 1 person since March now, contracts cancelled finally got decent contract decent amount people gonna split rooms cancelled last minute thanks covid spike area. I'm happy everyone staying safe shit sucks. Interesting, thanks!

It's wishful thinking part, wish people would shut wear masks. It'd nice people smart rather fucking whatever want. wanted hear unqualified, uneducated boomer spout misinformation nonsense coronavirus would look facebook. understand, CHANCE immunity works short term. started trials months ago, say certain immunity lasts long trial. someone got test vaccine 2 months ago, say certain immunity lasts 2 months, NOW. another month, say ""Ok say certain immunity lasts 3 months"" etc. 

But understand, way test subjects bodies respond vaccine, extremely likely immunity lasts much much longer 2 months. Honestly, u forgot golden rule pr

No pr bad pr work San Diego Zoo along Sister Park major tourist attractions open San Diego. San Diego Zoo work indoor bar supposed open. allow locations open zero oversight. Swedish schools remained open. data there. Good luck. Canada hiring preference citizens. apply job, employer hire competent citizen non-citizen. live Canada three years apply citizenship.

I agree though. lot occupation subreddits people asking Canada, covid, America's sliding racist police state. One worst aspects era primed see leaders cynical sociopaths. 


In reality, simplistic assumption bad, simply leads apathy inaction. 


We give people benefit doubt. Frankly, selfish people pretty obvious pay half attention. left US June go Antigua couple weeks lol  think I've talked people. unfortunate.  hope stay healthy Coronavirus could immediate long-term effects children’s physical health Ahh, gotcha.

Yeah reason Walmart sold food, considered ""essential"". Department stores not, allowed remain open.

Kohls could got around setting shelves groceries, obviously would pretty major business shift pull amid pandemic. elaborate this? I’m trouble understanding percent positive drop around 20% 10% literally overnight. wheres mexican cartels need /s Thank you, work pharma way vaccine getting distributed September they’re announced phase trial results yesterday. Phase III trials big analyzing data takes awhile. know cutting lot corners (a lot, seriously it’s crazy many corners) even so, regular folks aren’t getting jab summer 2021. think risk folks get couple months there’s way happen year certainly election. Ive tried Cinnamon Dolce one okay yeah. local grocery, International 3.99 Starbucks/Fairlife/Chobani creamers chose International bc CINNABON 😋 made claim "" Lancet released study found remdesivir work. "" 


The actual study says : 
 **Interpretation** study adult patients admitted hospital severe COVID-19, remdesivir associated statistically significant clinical benefits. **However, numerical reduction time clinical improvement treated earlier requires confirmation larger studies.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Which means drug administered early showing potential reduce time recovery, study showing signs effective used properly. 


Sure ""IT WORKS MIRACLE DRUG"" original claim working isnt accurate either. certainly good news things starting stabilize. important question is, populace learn careful wearing masks social distance month. competing study results right now. indicate children less likely acquire virus. Others say lower incidence reporting cases among kids they’re asymptomatic. One study indicated children least likely index case among families. guess point evidence seems inconclusive right now. Due politicized nature virus, wonder we’ll ever know truth.

EDIT: spelling source chance? I’ve trying find numbers exact thing trouble navigating cdc’s website think I’d find them. Reason came across [this study ](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/cause_of_death_20jul.html) done UK actually data supporting opposite. 

All 9 top leading causes death June well 5 year average June 2020. so, account difference years totals averages 9 categories, number “missing” deaths 9 categories doubles amount deaths attributed corona.

I trying type analysis numbers US, can’t seem find good enough data complete it. Based comment, seems like you’ve seen exact data I’m looking for? Maybe coconut fell head walking hospital. People focus two things once, especially one thing COVID global warming. Lol jackwads screamed ""WhAt BehngbhhhaZi"" two straight years four tragic understandable deaths. we're 100k deaths biggie since it'd make dear leader look bad. knob talking tried handwave away driving privilege, drive. Like, means stay fuck home germs, too. Children US school since Covid started. test spread US schools. Kids bring home like every cold. school kid equivalent bars mask distancing compliance, Covid spread like wildfire. infection rate high enough bars closed, schools closed. keep holding movie happen wealth redistribution happen. either introduce progressively expansive UBI schemes support people automated robotic future... orrr build heavily fortified compounds wherein bourgeoisie live comfort proletariat essentially left fend fight scraps left behind. Fair enough, realize current astronomical rise infections happened early-mid July still sometime see death rate spike using 18.5 days average. That's also believe numbers coming states like Texas playing games numbers makes Governors look like sociopaths opening early despite medical professionals recommendation.   said gonna die covid 19?...C'moooooon / said doesn’t help actually may worse wearing mask... could said make mask use sort face covering bandana etc actually helped opposed lying effectiveness saying later lied enable adequate supply nurses doctors. could made illegal mask sale general public medial personnel etc... told public make masks use bandana. enable spread virus masks work put much bad information public doesn’t trust now. mention DiBlasio Pelosi encouraging people go like normal go Chinatown knew virus lol Cuomo Murphy sending COVID patients nursing homes creating nightmare situation get criticism actually praise form Fauci media. Fuck outta here...truth logic literally means nothing guys goes politics agenda you’re fucking stupid don’t understand media works corporate oligarchy establishment political class people. Sorry Scott Jackson (oh) reallllll.... - OutKast like people want fund cause flood get burned crisp. Crazy. disregard suffering fact im pretty lucky healthy roof head, lot individual impact. lost intership Germany another United States (im astrophysics undergrad) governors

Are sending kids schools? donating wouldnt news

Yes would.

If huge award donated equivalent $115,000 pretty much anywhere, would make news.

That's big deal regardless it. make sure one gets hurt takes valuable ICU beds bothered consider others. like saying, fun driving speed limit sober, I'm going get plastered go 150mph I'm person matters. suspect combination mask mandate, gym/bar restrictions, enough people realizing getting real started socially distance appropriate manner. FUCKING. CLOSE. DOWN. 

God love capitalism much. You’re right September. said anything Summer 2021? wrong. Sunlight heat kill virus incredibly quickly. 

I live Texas I'll tell problem is. Bars reopened quickly I'll tell NOBODY enforcing capacity regulations set forth governor. 

So suddenly clubs bars across state completely packed careless young people hammered.

Most gyms enforcing capacity masks either. see every day social media. 

So caused spike, continued grocery store FULL people bringing entire families. rural areas full people social distancing wearing masks. 

Now HEB businesses forcing people wear masks starting see trend downwards places like Austin (where live). Read article commenting least tens comments asking stupid question? thought somebody flubbed title accidently put reality winner name supposed go Refused sign piece paper article right one guy statistically breaking everything day day showing discrepancy DOH website actual numbers. 

I tried figure tag you, recommend checking report daily want see cited data match DOH website reports. 

It’s also cited practically confirmed Florida skewing numbers it’s noted why. makes sense still fear losing job already talks dissolving work area covid. 
Everything Disney wrong. I'm really worried mom going back soon let off. worked Disney 20 years needs insurance. affordable option  know also affect children. Watching mother breathing issues last 4 months. None complained that.

Mask deniers logic-driven. waste time keep trying rationalize shitty behavior. definitely agree. also think type response elicited types articles ideal - panicked conscientious (purely anecdotal) experience. 

I think risk, justification thinking possibility, communicated even-handed way. get clicks, turn people neurotic hypochondriacs hyper-focused reading every piece news comes pandemic. I'm convinced totally past point righting ship misinformation virus anyway. ok, dad dumbass also. talk anymore text garden stuff covid data. virus new, won’t know long term effects be. Hopefully they’re bad  Fair point. Next time will. medical worker state without mask mandates common sense preventative measures would walked long ago.  Whatever distract current Coronavirus crises U.S. guess. 

If coronavirus hoax vaccines cause autism, care? /s Again, trillions trillions dollars invest solution, understand handle exceptions physical environment.

We virtual classes literally everyone else.

I see option.

You keep saying disagree that's keep limiting yourself. I'm limiting you. Also South Korea, Germany, Austria several european countries. Protesting much different attending outdoor event. It’s constitutional right tried ban outdoor protests really think country would go hell, people would stand it. mean, long beaches outdoor parks open don’t see protests can’t don’t done responsibly. agree strictly enforcing safety guidelines. Problem is, counties weren’t it’s late. Compliancy major issue don’t think slapping fine people wearing masks going effective tbh. mean, sovereign citizens exists despite getting tickets constantly. People fucking stubborn. Starbucks creamers they're good. Internationals like 3$ bottle last FOREVER small thing guess site changed app icon happened US 
with GF movement surrounding incident. Yet global unprecedented pandemic killed hundreds thousands, nothing. also dealt with. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

Did whole 15 mins dedicated singing mixed up? I’m putting information hopefully people upvote visibility:

It technically illegal teachers strike 34 states. states, legislature (law, constitution, both) include penalties teachers strike. Many states trying pass legislation penalties 2018 2019 teacher strikes.

FLORIDA ONE STATES: 
Penalties Florida teachers strike, unions support include: 
-Termination
-Revocation certification
-All retirement benefits lost
-Fine $5k per day strike individual teacher
-unions organize support teachers strike decertified (losing collective bargaining teachers), lose right collect dues, fined $20k per day strike. 

So lot “Just it, can’t fire everyone” 

No, kill unions, fine teachers enough lose everything, take retirement kind big deal. Read article, jfc. really think you’re right, unfortunately. haven’t really started feel true economic pain yet :(  want spend last months miserable existence grief inevitably die covid19? healthcare worker may deal infected patients daily basis, simple fact kids school asymptomatic carriers continually change classrooms throughout day matter days every room school contaminated virus. 

They schools going sterilizing school buildings daily basis mean matter days probably find higher concentrations virus schools ICU ward. stating legit, stating events occur. knowledge Russia actually did. even prefaced statement stating understanding skepticism. Governor, children cope give teacher COVID teacher ends dead?

""They're going get it"" Well lying/misrepresentation advising mask usage (they said thing) got banned deservedly so

WHO said evidence yet time masks could help protect getting infected much yes. Thanks aclaration! know better repeat watch news. Funny think we're *not* headed ""some new crisis"" 2021 already... Oh no, I'm Christian that's creepy frick. make room pray unless church. Even want to. someone versed tell short probably one widely available? I've trying keep information conflicting. one best chance replicating huge rate highest success? likely pretty even combination? think need start delineating fatality resulting initial infection vs fatality resulting chronic illness that's possibly result infection.

We know fatality rates hospitalized. likely hospitalized high risk vulnerable.

We know hypercoagulation drive fatality rating one wakes feeling extra clotty.

We know least mild asymptomatic cases. vaccine widely distributed make huge difference. may also much better treatment January. I'm holding hope able curb stomp virus early next year. course, that's everything goes perfect. You’re gonna need better source know working coronavirus vaccine many years right? 2016 close vaccine ran funding rushed THINK is. Good see Israel still denying existence place shall named. basic iq test... follow instructions wear mask? doesnt take scientist, takes population isnt wilfully ignorant. oc places cali huge rightwing, christian populations. populations dont science. daughter's friends say this, nothing worry about. Drives crazy. Two* 
Make Trump Bolsonaro. whose going teach teacher hospital? wrong.

New Zealand good case point.

Please think research deeply. ""The rationale re-open schools rooted public health, politics.""

Ok guess stop reading there, article clearly disingenuous written bad faith. live nation people don’t want believe professionals. 

No one listens teachers, won’t. Unless whole put education spotlight place increased value it, still won’t listen teachers. We’re looked peons system, blamed everything, given nothing, expected make miracles happen. teachers actually successfully. you’re going use stats, try using right population figures countries. hospital even it... reason travel bans rarely, ever, advocated public health officials. tend be... ineffective compared widespread testing quarantining potentially infected individuals. first relevant Google result says 36,000 died car accidents 2016. would imagine 2017-2019 numbers similar, done digging. Meanwhile, we're 130,000 4-5 months COVID... Great find. Exactly expected. Joe says run. likely want him. think could realistically blow wide open.  Got another source that? Ah ok yeah get that. personally mind see makes difference. Quite true. always punishing women sex. 

Nevertheless, find highly entertaining shove hypocrisy right face disgusting, venomous ""pro-life"" shitbags. Gotcha, sorry, thought saying best would ineffective. like Lancet.  Good know.

In less time took type rant, could look Joe Grogan's resume. Research good. still easily return country though. yet. I’ve watching videos theme park vloggers spending multiple days Orlando Disney reopening morbid curiosity. It’s pretty awful theme parks subjecting employees too. smile wave try keep experience normal possible, get strong feeling none really want much. 

Short that, can’t picture enjoying park customer like that. vloggers keep saying good back, much fee safe Disney parks, there’s pretty sharp disconnect they’re showing camera. Maybe it’s crippling empathy, would feel awful going theme park knowing forced someone risk health start roller coaster me. 

I can’t think anything world less essential roller coaster. dare give away inheritance 30 years ago existed! people need source income? Lots tourists retirees infinite free time.  Lol! feel bad that. hope appendix stays friendly. Like guy built match.com lose gf someone met match.com Yes, underpowered split 7 arms.

So 60-65 patients arm sufficient distinguish - 1-3 deaths per arm, hard distinguish random pattern there.

So mortality weakest stat emerge - Dr Boulware Univ Minnesota post-prophylaxis trial - ie enough people (they serious cases arms, deaths).

This study however could give reasonable stats adverse events.

But hard balance arms comorbidities etc. 60-65 patients. Initially, probably optimistically, hoping click-baity article. Read could think we're screwed.  6am?! wait 10am here. Hospitalizations good metric watch fluctuate number tests. New hospitalizations 500, new record. exactly news want hear I’m visiting family ... Protecting subsets economy, specifically net worth multi millionaires, expense public health pretty bad.

Containing virus real plan always best path healthy economy. instead let rip pray vaccine people die economy sucks anyway  we're still waiting double blinds finish publish. Observational studies best moment. Im glad last week wasnt time someone heckles press briefing. Stand Florida! Public shaming goes viral way get fellow American's attention. know know contact? someone tests positive, give every place they’ve everyone they’ve nears info?  mean relation adverse effects.  Won’t. could helped us. gave trillions banks. Reasonable opinion ? said annoying. Like girl coming house talk jesus, girl going world talk environment listen fucking scientists. air doesnt pass AC filter person limited usefulness. Well you’ve downplaying virus months, current predictions likely age well last, keep wrong make new excuses. I'm confused outdoors, social distancing, required masks, highly increased sanitation limited attendance worse going Walmart Whole Foods. arent taking kid? get home pop mask may well taken whole family grocery store you. social distancing outside park much different piling Home Depot Saturday get plants? Even aren't, interacting people get groceries something ""essential"". people allowed enjoy acknowledge accept associated risks - risks accept buying food supplies? still school boards meeting person, masks, distancing, voting (sometimes unanimously) move forward person school start regularly scheduled. pharmacist let throw two cents in. 

Actemra rapidly approved years ago cytokine storm CAR-T therapy became thing. 

Dexamethasone used treatment, well budesonide, ibuprofen. Etc . Drugs saying ""experimental""

Well , sure experimental covid new, stuff covid causes. 

But therapies done one two docs would post, patient die dont makes worse. werent appropriate statistical analysis, werent peer reviewing possibly werent right. 

(Every conspiracy theorist think maliciousness certain country)

Oh right, became political statement instead. quarantine, won't.

No, I'm saying really odd drug that's around long well known safety profile first covid-based study America completely ignore existing data drug. use covid specifically new, use antiviral new. 

That study already retracted people still going around referencing calling HCQ dangerous, etc based single (now retracted) study showed HCQ dangerous. Multiple studies coming countries showing things little effect statistically significant effect. small underpowered/bad observational studies, get good double blind study work with, that's have. 

Do think one retracted study showing HCQ dangerous fraudulent? Eh, idk, seems odd ignore known facts drug start way outside parameters know effective. like control patients getting recommended dosages others getting increasingly high doses see difference, went straight massive dosages seems odd me. you’re JAQing pretty hard.

Some people qualified make certain decisions. Especially pandemic (with ecological crisis looming afterward might add). boomers (or others) behave like children maybe treated such. one New York New Jersey Connecticut list. I've seen list always check since live border Northampton County Pennsylvania Southern Warren County, NJ. Also NY NJ CT quarantine list see Pennsylvania listed  Jesus man, can’t dim.

Worldwide official mortality 4.1%. wide variability mortality country primarily due countries ability inability test identify cases. hope understand that. 

The actual mortality rate estimated continues estimated many organizations across world, CDC example estimate mortality rate around 0.2% June... aware unable identify majority cases, article many others said frankly plainly obvious anyone ability think. 

I can’t believe incompetence exists place. Yeah, right coworkers decided stop wearing masks hardly wash hands/use hand sanitizer. I'm one still so, get mocked it. Ironically named *Hazard* High Super sucks. even limited pool hours. closed.

No. vaccine may proved actually work then. already manufacturing doses MIGHT able get people vaccinated November EVERYTHING goes right. Probably mostly healthcare workers.  Again, mask works well care? 

I already answered question. mindset might influence others. Furthermore get Corona likely infect family (and perhaps friends) close contact might share views. wear masks home even wear constantly reduce risks infection. Nobody ever claimed 100% secure, certainly much better protection ready admit mask doesnt anything that's exactly sounding like.

The vast majority health experts agree wearing mask reduces risk getting Corona. clue still think kind myth. toddlers people like stamping feet didnt get way stupid mask idea believe. 

Why think Europe fraction infected numbers? started wearing masks march still so. no, [nothing 

I seriously clue hell wrong people. anybody fucking misinformed thickheaded beyond me. 

Perhaps close minded get virus understand. Like [army attended Corona party, thought Corona hoax. 

I'm done you. fucking sad. I’d still Likely cause young children smaller lungs expel many virons cough/breath/talk. Foment transmission large vector initially thought.

Sure pain ass really what's small inconvenience end day. preferable either never seeing anyone saying f gathering indoors masks like dumbasses. would wise federal governments prepare PPE materials emergency lockdowns contain spread. healthcare workers risk viral exposure unconscionable. nothing wise telling people gamble wellbeing.   N95 cloth mask cover do. Problem solved. everyone trying develop vaccine share notes anyone worrying patents go fuck majority Americans? That's nice idea, clearly true tens millions even wear mask pandemic. That's okay. 48% parents (majority) district want kids stay home virtual learning. They're full open instead. Hahah. Thankfully governor made provide remote learning want option.  loss smell taste strongly correlated actual Covid diagnosis, loss tend complete near complete, partial. self-isolate, notify contacts, get tested third day symptoms onset, rate false negative falls 20% reliable test get, see  though based loss taste would recommend act like contagious even get another negative result.

Saying something make true Anyone remember April almost 1000 people dying every day New York? Don’t pretend states like Texas situation New York March April gonna say ""he's animal"" wana insult animals 😕 How's virus history working you?

If US Government handled epidemic responsibly problem florida thered demand Disney, guests Disney Staff Disney reopen.

If need someone blame, top list **always** government. 99% times government facilitates shit, gets away start pecking suffering consequences failures. even risk associated taking it, given can't get long term data administration. Reminds arguing creationists younger edgier days. endless flood ""but... but... but... *this*, huh??""  know pointless condescending questions are? ""Daily State-by-State Testing Trends - Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center"" slowed testing quite bit. positivity rate relatively flat.  Downplay side effects want, they're seeing significant side effects level, carefully selected phase 1 2 study groups, vaccine never get approved. 

And based safety data. also unlikely vaccine successfully protect people Sars-CoV2 infection significant period time. 


This relevant read vaccine progress School kids 16-19 closed Sweden. Still age group differs compared Finland younger age groups. also higher ratio antibodies younger kids. Pre school teachers/care givers risk ratio 0,7 Sweden (median risk among occupations 1,0).

Finland saw change infection rate closing (or reopening) schools. 

I think might schools open closed data future probably conclusive. aren’t solid numbers yet hospitalizations per infection versus hospitalization per detected infection. take grain salt. article indicate whether would consequences guest noncompliance immediately return requests clarification. that's odd accusation. Shut fuck look Giraffe! Tremendous sympathies. I'm recovering wife able work remotely pretty much time. Hell, her.

Cuz all, you, that's issue here. coworker - ""Oops, *coughcough* *hackwheeze* autopilot [again]"", ""So?"" ""What?!? I'm customer, deal it"" Bad article. Sample size bad.

Also, ""article"" trash, rolling blog post. Searching ""beach town"" results headline itself. make sense response. stated months make people give up. responded say months track Christmas. Like good you? read calendar? way addresses point.

If people give use justify gave up, fault, fault facts. That’s realist thing seen reddit awhile  lack hospitalizations. 

What’s evidence least 1 million new cases everyday we’ll achieve full 330 million spread US population (currently estimated 30 million) 10 months. Again, ignoring fact us 30 million right would 5-6 million cases per month. want say it’s 1 million cases every day. Even 50 million estimated current it’s 8-9 million cases month. gave June 30 million 1 mil day, guess didn’t spread March April May. 


Your math doesn’t work 1 million day. That’s know.  got bored, simple that... don’t feel bad social pressures hanging this.

Question - good retort people keep claiming numbers inflated hospitals calling every death Covid death, even died motorcycle accident. agree believe onsey-twosey mistakes happen people believe hard facts plays directly belief ""the media get Trump"", making political thing rather health/science thing. alternative simply let kids learn remotely spread virus brought control reopen schools safe. people given disaster relief stay home safely folks wear masks anytime need go would take months get virus control. Worst care scenario everyone's kids repeat grade catch up. There's nothing ""far dangerous"" dead children, dead parents teachers, children adults long term organ damage limitations rest lives. country ""stomped out"" virus...theyve temporarily hid Pay Medicare, Medicaid, social security for...

a year. google “school-to-prison pipeline” Guys, found ""tough"" guy. Well sounds like conjecture me. facts. Interestingly seems match sequence Strauss &amp; Howe's 4 Turnings theory. Weak men create hard times seems match 3rd Turning. Nope. That's weird even Christian company. anything church would like ""hey we're gonna pray, feel free join go grab snack"" home ...look CARES act see applies business~ get well!! writer might want change Australia another example seeing Melbourne getting hit again. normal amount deaths Texas? 30 million population I'm thinking 10k 10 days.

All test everyone dies. 10% antibodies coronavirus. Then, bingo, died Covid matter really died of. Without mandate government, businesses whatever think make money. 

The coffee shop work closed lobby accordance law, reopened accordance law, closed due outbreaks area, looking reopen make money. suppose so, commenting something called ""enforcement captain"", based article people ones confronting either asking people leave giving mask. 

I would also imagine someone wants job ""enforcement captain"" probably going someone likes confrontation really good handling it. doubt going put random people position.

I think hot bead two hot heads bump really bad things happen. lot less dramatic phrase terms overall budget, military part 15% .. putting money in, think I'll wait drop.

It reasonably obvious. objective hit expect perfect moment, avoid putting 30k there, watching 10k evaporate year one. Read letter White House sent directly detailing exactly happened. I'm sure google it.

I didnt say coronavirus isnt sickness killing people (although numbers hard believe. we're marking covid deaths begin even believed).

I dont see masks solution it. I've known people wearing masks perfectly contracted covid, people like blatantly refuse wear one perfectly fine. find funny people believe placebo effect. like tsunami, everyone perplexed sudden calm retreating waves. bad could be, right? rushed check out, intentionally oblivious impending doom.

&amp;#x200B;

It end well. looking different numbers? average 77k highest day 75k? days around 60. Football nba starts 10 days Legally? Sure. not? Practically? Sounds like holes matter will.

Just curious, part particular question? percentage GDP, current military spending low since 1930s. can't even visit Canada live NL border go shopping NL (masked) scares non excistent masks netherlands I'm wearing masks, wear issues abiding it, YES right wear mask choose to(if mandated state) like right wear mask store right ask put one tell leave protect employees customers store, can't ways They'll complain step line, taking ass mouse smile beneath mask. Disgrace society Anybody know expected false negative rate Quest tests? seeing called ""kitchen sink"" strategy. WeST Siidddddeeeee!!!! They'll ones using COVID excuse incarcerated. FWIW, here's California's latest numbers well, quite control Arizona Florida. Nursing homes can't ""close down"". people nursing homes still need care without covid. fact nursing homes need even labor hours ensure safety cleanliness protocols followed. Can't test vaccine way? someone English degree....what linear stuff mean then? track hit 7 million next month? tendency laugh something truly awful happen. makes interesting serve team sometimes. laugh hopelessly fucked absurd is.

I EXACT thing, coworkers 'get' it.

I laughed hard saw  idiot I'm Texas lease expired June. sent notification renewal rates April exact price paid last year. poor mother law us social distance yard bring dinner seating. talking Christmas Thanksgiving cancelled already. hoping weather okay enough maybe social distance hour. reminded granddaughter boyfriend teachers see actually go class room unless quarentine two weeks before. looked could tell even crossed mind yet. already upset enough grandson picking Covid-19 work three weeks ago.  moved city university 1.5 years 3 year degree. rest degree online education first 1.5 years. didn’t cafeteria buy priced garbage didn’t get overpay parking, otherwise same.  parents must odd sense humor. second thought headline racehorse. I'm still confused. I’m looking anything. 

She’s thrust limelight speaking UN, Parliament, Congress. Again, it’s great wants symbol climate change movement, symbol impractical solution. Social distancing fatigue. simple that. AZ vaccine like 90% chance successful. already know - proving safety (which already know go motions). Boris talking 'normal Christmas'. already knows. forget early epidemic one epi guys writing CDC always absolute highest quality work..... two months late. perfect example.  Yep, rich ever spend, still try bleed us dry get last penny.

Now entire government run money perspective, that's *you* look like me. Consider maybe us sheep, repeating suits party line. us want live, without fear police kneeling necks, going wrong house killing us ""accidentally"" sleep. things important. Disneyland not. Seriously think it...  realize facetious original comment? Mark Twain condemns tied raft Mississippi River face up, bleached blinded Sun pummeled rains eat nothing flies land mouth, become food Alligator Gar float south. Going suck people trying use LinkedIn find new job. Serious question. exposed, got tested, waiting results. temp 100 4 days I'm fine. boss, even temp checks every 30 minutes 100, let work home. I'm worried test pointless time get results, 2 weeks past I've done nothing prevent spreading work. choice, chose wear mask entire day since day got tested try help. know else do. advice greatly appreciated. Even HR manager seem concerned. sad day read wall text reminds ""do look like"" meme sure actual quote satire. visceral reaction simply asking somebody wear simple piece cloth sake possibly saving lives. asked person hero situation save life another way I'm sure they'd without hesitation. Yet asking wearing mask unfathomable them. fucking hell wrong Americans. Look rolling average saying cases can't rise again, clearly downturn peak. Well, I'm Canadian, still wonder kind thing, image ""front line worker"" given visible people:

- retail workers stores
- people delivering mail
- medical staff

When reality people working behind scenes pretty much anyone realizes. People water treatment - waste pickup. mail processing. Electricity needs keep running, needs keep business running, food needs move. Trucks need go across borders, list endless.

Just kind ruminating people's images ""front line workers"" - someone like myself, think one, guess am, since work never stopped (And cases, simply got busier).

I'm going three week long vacation couple days definitely happy take break.  No. working vaccine (which may take years, likely come) go back normality. shit. thought Dollat Tree's parent company Wal-Mart?  True. Early doses prioritized health care workers, IIRC back April. Using anti-aircraft guns! love Publix, shop frequently, going North Carolina wish Harris Teeter's well. Costco (Clifton NJ) afternoon guy toilet paper section mask slipped nose. soon realized apologising everyone. It’s pretty hardcore frowned upon here. haven’t able smell taste since Thursday. Yesterday wife got antibody test said negative. Either something wrong test, or, well, don’t know. Looking horrible track-record foreign intervention outcomes since 2001 even working. Peter Thiel became citizen NZ two weeks. also spreads extraordinarily easily, growing exponentially major threat within weeks new area. 

That's something running large % immune individuals behaves. even slowed down. news media people getting tested, week people got tests, explaining small part difference. upwards trend clear. fact supports thory

Lol eat ass. Take care. really think Trump able distort data country independently verified hundreds times? mean testing 100% accurate either used help isolate track infections, worth deploying *and value pension life lives others shouldnt teacher first place.  you’re healthy American adult, won’t getting anytime soon don’t even worry that. time it’s turn we’ll begging work hard pay loan early, get ding credit rating. (Just happened husband's coworker. credit rating lower paid car early). ppl say we're brainwashed .-. probation, part probation attending school school work. feel like we, nation, futilely trying get back correct quarantine standards established like 1 2 weeks back March. Yet unfortunately moving backwards reduced waiting vaccine thing ultimately save us disaster. could done now, didn’t. could ramped testing, didn’t. It’s going happen. one can't WAIT hear Donald Plump field questions, answer one instead talk shut flights China super early #1 tests universe test every country combined. Fox News told pandemic would election....  nothing going change favor time soon you’ll deal it.

Now opinion. Sorry confuse facts opinions. Get well soon! Depends career is.

Are Developer / Engineer / Medical professional? 

You're gonna get scooped another country want leave. don’t make absolutely option. 

That completely defeats purpose closing schools. That's like saying ""you wear mask, option wear it."" Like, no. 

And propose teachers teach in-person remotely? would’ve safer go school better procedures place. 

Schools funds this. would campus say, 50 classrooms, socially distance classrooms already capacity? would work? Stick half kids outside learn? Would teachers teach twice many classes? #Artictle

Ever new studies bring new insights coronavirus infection affects body. Chinese researchers already shown study Covid-19 negative effect brain function, Norwegian researchers even speak ""Covid-19 brain"". Regensburg study confirming coronavirus infection attacks brain. According press release Barmherzige Brüder Regensburg hospital, Covid-19 lead symptoms headache, confusion, disorientation, loss smell, anxiety even delusions. ""We examined patients mild moderate course disease slight neurological impairments,"" explains Professor Sven Wellmann, chief physician neonatology KUNO Clinic St. Hedwig professor Chair Pediatric Adolescent Medicine University Regensburg: ""And found Covid-19 attacks lungs also causes neurological damage."" disease subsided, symptoms usually disappear, yet known long-term neurological damage could caused coronavirus disease  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* first amendment allow walk naked street?

Man, look reason downplay severity virus.  Swedes really quite stubborn post deleted posted articles statistics kinda joke Brazil? happening USA...

 Report anyone sex with.. Uhh yeah no. understand applicable strategy thats testing lacking super uncomfortable afraid defy adults kid stood posed say thing.


I'm afraid anymore ((will prob cry confront someone tho)) great NZ. big influx overseas wealthy exacerbate distance haves have-nots. ""Buckle face masks"" want Trump campaigning dinner hour? 

Watch him. 

Check facts. (For social media opportunities.)

 Make note sponsors.

Except did. learned herd immunity important component getting past thing. state seen sustained drop cases without first reaching least 20% infected. California New York 19M also invented hamberders. low IFR / secret herd immunity crank while. IIRC even nutty theory SARS-1 could Asia better. SARS-1 infected nearly one East Asia countries. might well say ""Humans desperately need transportation get places, drunk driving okay."" broken logic.

People need go house parties socialize.

People need pack like sardines bars socialize.

People need wear masks socialize.

There happy mediums people act responsible ways also fill social needs. eschew restrictions social behavior give fuck lives others.

All justifying selfish behavior kills people. make angry face like 😠 every time order something.

That'll show 'em... Alright, sorry said ‘winning lottery’ took literally. 

The point healthy young people don’t care cared everything around odds killing them, they’d never leave house.  don’t see accurate infection numbers many asymptomatic may never get tested. Oh yah know great... America going virtually nothing feel like better news not... semantics you?

Rationale - reason course action

Motivation - reason acting certain way

You're acting like antonyms.  Yes, total mess. Plus deem problem daily Public Health England deaths still sky high Vs hospital deaths waiting investigation. surprised find massive count peak, either kind long tail deaths eg Covid killing people months released hospital big count easy (my money bit honest) sure work honest. made realize dependent entertainment/leisure services. massive percentage economy giving/getting entertainment services others (vs production goods). debit free within means would allow stop working terms, hunker needed.

That's mostly true, even debt free cost free. I'm there, I'm still treading water stay afloat. Healthcare, maintenance (water, power, property tax, food), insurance costs add pretty quickly, even careful. I'm complaining, mind - much, much better debt hope get spot options. 

You'll still treading water stay afloat, least shark chasing you. ;-) way want You’re entitled opinion. I’ll keep enjoying healthcare keeps well allows enjoy life. is. people congregating big groups. Problem stopped, ego rivals Mars. haven't, made months ago. Everything happens reason. (

Says people unfamiliar logic Large Numbers. MA. national chains making policies stores nationwide states require masks. person asking first require nationwide, regardless state policy. Well, then, he’s got problem.

And don’t blame businesses finding anyway skirt rules   Yeah never truly mattered. money spent it.

The ones common cold coronaviruses.. ""I gene person, good gene!"" feel you. looking gainful employment year half. Finally got position decent pay covid started. new position interacting lot people different facilities (USPS) . wife type 1 diabetic, immunosuppressed 3 organ transplants, etc. resign people social distance wear mask, lysol ""ordered"". Covid-19 cases involving kids exceptionally rare. Numbers comparable pneumonia. shut planet pneumonia.

Plus, spread disease others easily well. took antibody test thinking around February so, since tested negative flu buddy insane sick time month. antibody test came back negative I'm curious I'll get it. live NC people ""if ain't Jesus rebel flag telling wear mask way Sam's hell "". 

My question long thing stay dormant? wear mask primarily I'm afraid giving someone may immunodeficiency elderly. work place alone 3 confirmed cases, split building half months ago case one side confirmed case. Welp side got confirmed case (3 them) workplace still kept open stating would disinfect daily. luckily got approved work remotely due migraines, however girlfriend works office still, side confirmed cases. 

Any help would appreciated admit I've read there, scientific basis concerning virus I'm bit ignorant it.  realistically mean covid stay, like flu? virus mutate slowly enough it'd possible eradicate completely? canceled rent/mortgages yet?

I believe that. news, water wet. cancelled wedding basically threw life plans moving year wack. people unaffected virus, nothing-year, progress, might well like never existed Well, showing kid's activity books ads. looking buy yesterday.. maybe looking masks lately. Thanks Google ads.. future partner probably still thinking girls cooties right anyway. honestly thought vaccines general good life trained body. mean vaccine? know many based quickly economy recovered $1200 checks went harping point workers ""are teenagers"". 

Again, linked paper refutes assertion. received plenty stimulus establishments think it’s best country earth propaganda Cold War. millions people primed see Tyranny! anytime federal gov't mildly inconveniences anybody (in middle class). 

It's rational nation. Yes, says enormous amount intellectual state American public. would say reflects sour discourse propaganda mental disorder, potatoes potatoes. Southwest Florida starts immediately South Venice/Sarasota - Port Charlotte. 

I don’t think many people consider Fort Pierce/Vero Beach South Florida. Thats thinking Why? thought NY well... Bring on. Four years wearing masks????!!11

What *MY* freedoms???!!112 mean best could onset plague, followed science get control situation, model.

All fighting federal government? numbers way off. entertainment subreddit, head /r/covid19 care numbers facts. would too. I'm seeing reports teachers making funeral arrangements school begins. least Army, got death benefit killed combat. They're lucky masks insurance. would done differently order ""prepped?"" send COVID+ elderly **back nursing homes**?

It's virus without vaccine. always making sure hospitals exceed capacity. That's happening anywhere right now. 

Yes, sucks. No, can't stop it.  Unfortunately, there’s standardization different countries categorize death toll. That’s Belgium outlier. won’t know real figures look excess mortality it’s over.

The US spent weeks neck-and/neck Ireland. they’re way better, even though death aren’t 2000 day. They’re still embarrassingly high, enough increasing deaths per million faster countries us worldometers list. one eyeing New Zealand. So..what saying is...might well give up? Throw away masks, get together party? world live in. Instead coming together create vaccine, happening. wonder world state in. Seroprevalence studies don’t back up, you.

You certainly welcome believe want without science back you. throw many numbers want ignore someone points aren’t anywhere near correct. doesn’t make true change largest outbreaks workplaces, growing number children contracting COVID-19, deaths still climbing, great deal excess deaths included count. Clearly set ways going change mind science probably isn’t either. So, we’re impasse.

Maybe get good treating COVID .2% come true. right now, we’re there.

Here seroprevalence articles studies easily found searching news section “seroprevalence COVID-19 US” interested many people actually COVID-19 per (This one estimated 6 24x known infections high end still 30% population *some* (only neighborhoods 50%. State whole looks like Guess anti-vaxxers anti-mask Karen’s Kevin’s better rush get skinny jeans fitted mom dad bods can.

tl;dr: usually go away infection, unknown long term effects could be. cognitive impairment sepsis. hard articulate. confused black Friday worse Unless say say COVID-19 positive much that? 60 billion? Damn, would actually helpful. constantly get line 98% people survive Covid. response 98% people survive gunshot wound abdomen (if bleed ambulance gets there). grasp there's different levels ""not dying"". Maybe they'll show another propaganda video great job they're least parts US late. even admitted they've gone trying contain trying track spread. People blame government much want, unless behavior starts changing numbers get worse worse. Make 30. dashboard, appreciate linking see claim made better CDC's site absolute bull cases 100% people got infected? know corona takes night 10 PM able president Tv every day giving messages hope, strength pulling together etc would easily gotten again. something working crisis want change it. countries would absolutely fund underground resistance movement, although motives suspect best (surely would claim love ""real America"" much actual American) worst want destroy America (still claiming sake ""real America).  Nice couple years late Maybe best, certainly better many. you’ve traveled likes Russia, Turkey Brazil, you’ll quickly see U.S. stands. get stay home starve 6 months get measly government checks.  calling dunce desipte acting like one? lmao okay idiot, realizing wrong dong anything change right direction go. observed people wear masks everywhere Japan crowded keep social distancing. Plus government loosening regulations fight virus. mention people get fatigued numb situation. ha good! joking, felt like good chance throw there. eat crappy food time def dont meh. Truly Bullshit.

Maybe true officially, NY's outbreak next testing vast majority cases detected. Ahhh okay. explains money came from. wondering. necessary deaths? rofl. zero fat one. husband basically cut ties Michigander mother law (and insane conspiracy theory/rascist bullshit spouts daily). convinced fine Florida, every death labeled covid death government great job. nurse friend Florida told everything fine! liberal media trying make Trump look bad! told state going everything possible hide covid death illness order keep tourism cash flowing. devolved argument we're done. need lives right now. hard enough mental health we've quarantining since March. People keep claiming mortality rate summer reached death rates April despite confirmed cases. evidence 10x cases reported March/April, reason 2000 deaths per day actually much higher rate daily cases currently...they counted. could easily get back death rates actions taken slow spread. get feeling Bob Chapek's vote counts hell lot mine. Russian hackers? sentence insulting boys lizardmen pray lizardlord. lizardmen believe is.

On serious note: misinformation primary reason. Guess people still kissing Blarney Stone  Yes no. yet see restaurants place tables 6 ft apart. honestly really hard.

How first detect novel virus? Symptoms significant enough warrant medical treatment either doctor's office hospital.

In beginning, understanding limited this.

It took several months establish asymptomatic patients exist even longer determine still see systemic impacts like hypercoagulation inflammation.

And people feel fine go doctors. Insurance companies want pay scans labs patients feel fine symptoms.

It's difficult finding data mild asymptomatic cases records data? collected? research comes hospitals requires people require hospitalization. Really? 8 hours never pull masks take off?    knew lady worked Airline deal Disney flight package combined Disneyland. quotas pressured hard sell package. said, “That Mickey greedy little mouse.” always stuck hear voice.  School school near school kids hanging anyway. big groups either park around other’s houses.

There’s got middle ground allow education go there’s lost generation. 

They’d less contact school supervised kept groups / bubbles best possible.

Perhaps vulnerable staff could online learning kids that’s can’t go school due living vulnerable parents. Politicians bleed, too. know they're signing let get way purpose.

""If convince lowest white man he's better best colored man, notice picking pocket. Hell, give somebody look on, he'll empty pockets you."" Emergency use means rich people get it. effectively protect vulnerable 10% would end needing hospital care that's that's really needed. Spanish flu... wouldn’t herd immunity work? It’s similar vaccine herd immunity. modern era, usually able stop disease herd immunity, one’s extra tricky flatening death curve, stopped anything... death curve rising again. Situation changes passage time, complicated concept.   believe aim exposure help polls.

Looks like volunteers take acetaminophen pills 1 day vaccine. 2 doses complicate issue since moderate side effects high doses?  Pestis.  Well, entertaining watch Nearly? one worse? It’s way report delay. Friday Saturday usually biggest days Tuesday usually like Sunday dip elsewhere. 

That said, deaths reported fall traditional seven-day pattern.  covid humanitys friend then? blood test. Dude said negative virus antibodies. I’m thinking probably scam. Place looked little sketchy. find uneasy parallels 2016 election. Nobody thinks know going win. Polls heavily one sided, BAM, unthinkable happens... appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Even babies survive, damage done may lead life time complications. know reaching effects virus. *”Widely available”*

I’m enjoying coverage. much depends vaccine's efficacy, know yet. vaccines may confer immunity finite period time. vaccines may still allow catch covid, disease would significantly less severe (but may still contagious). vaccines might trigger immune response 90% people all.

We see happens vaccines actually come out. may dependent vaccine eligible receive. cant fly europe stay lol, theyd deport mouse must obeyed /s Ignore tests. couldn’t gotten 10x official figures without positives exceeding 100k per day. far. Ah, right.

Well maybe environmentalists would stop assuming fracking causes earthquakes bad planet, would able easily harvest oil right feet.

But hey, let's put spotlight 17-year-old privileged white kid Sweden everyone virtue signal behind desks (while still using palm oil hey, convenience!!!) forget boycotting protesting private companies. way would work America, virus far deadly.

Nah, America atleast, far like odometer car, goes one way. feel bad world mercy enormously corrupt oligarchy vastly overfunded military, staffed even inept newly angered population workers even easily mislead. 

When ride stop again? Crazy locked early hard still experiencing lot cases despite everyone swearing good job. Maybe show lockdowns don’t really anything delay inevitable think “herd” part came from? It’s well known method disease control agriculture.

 guess since read Wikipedia you’re expert? good , f texas Yeah, ICE totally going claiming new territory name United States.

What even talking about? going go bankrupt case well. newspaper Quito today said Costa Rica beginning struggle restrictions, many businesses resisting. Here's article (I post translation need it, maybe paste Google translate.)

Dr. Brian Dixon, biology professor University Waterloo Canada Research Chair Fish Environmental Immunology, said third-stage trials also researchers determine severe side effects associated vaccine.

He said include excessive fever causing hospitalization disability excessive swelling causing meningitis Kawasaki disease.
Dixon said vaccines proceed stage-three trials, one 100,000 people found experience severe side effects, vaccine likely won’t approved.
“In normal course vaccine development, like 90 per cent 95 per cent vaccines make three phases human trials make market things like serious side effects,” said. claiming mask use fake news? lol. Things really got hand ""fake news"" crap. indoctrinated people allow reject anything like emotional level without providing rational reasons.

Two things:

1. think understand way intellectual honesty science works. novel coronavirus pandemic. understanding virus infection spreads becomes better strategy change. would far worrying advice strategy employed beginning pandemic never changed. 
2. Masks help keep infected people shedding viral particles. well understood asymptomatics mild symptomatic people make good chunk infections. That's masks crucial public. 100% effective, known beneficial. Since almost downsides masks huge upside no-brainer.

So yes, knowledge understanding grew advice masks changed. That's reason science motion. great news beyond me. able think critically issues. sick hearing herd immunity. would take long time 70% population get viable. literally 70% population gets many dead people 65 that?

Quite frankly Oxford vaccine potential continually over-hyped timeline.

Back late April saying would Phase 3 efficacy data enough June know worked.

As got closer June changed said ""Well virus circulating enough UK anymore probably know""

It's hyping data Phase 1, monkey, pig, mouse, etc Phase 3 UK gone 3 months. data. Yet totally stopped talking about. 


Now moved Phase 3 Brazil South Africa. kept saying would start US knowledge seemingly stalled front skethcy-ass Moderna going start Phase 3 US AZ ""odd"".

Now keep pushing back timelines. They've received billions handouts. large Phase 3 studies going awhile. data. either works doesn't.


I know embraced science press release red-flags Oxford really starting pick up. 


I still somewhat hopeful people better start get ready learn failed.


Edit: want people really start accept AZ fails pushes back timelines much simply vaccine. many ""experts"" starting realize: virus burning vaccine. possible we'll EUA somethine like Regenoron cocktail virus spread point near saturation US burn next couple months. vaccine come time. quite frankly absurd notion anyway. Profit population control. Mo poor, mo problems wait till next week. “Who?”

-the mouse stepping backs employees know may sound morbid think really need get video inside overwhelmed hospitals out. 

People need “see” it. know happened Italy shook people action. hurts read No. made day trying tell someone worked S2 bio lab, focus chemistry antibiotics phd 20 years experience handling dangerous chemicals plus occasional usage ppe due incidents university, ppe use it, also precautions need taken avoid infected.

Oh boy, that's funny. people would training, chemicals gear home would reacted way ensured family staid secure, virus would eliminated months ago.

So keep handmade mask, I'll keep professional gear have, happy.

And thx tha laugh. Great self reflection. people think like Tremendous words American way get Remdesivir get gouged it. exact thing happened friends GA... 5 hours gave went home... days later, get results positive even though never tested... 2 them.

This seems critical detail mess up... McDonalds 2 drive lanes... verify pay... gov't workers can't figure out??? care. news mean anything...... Imagine? already happened US. might 2 weeks infection.

Sure. extreme end.

More common symptom onset 2 - 5 days.

You inaccurate there.

But correct comment, point. I’m fairly sure I’ve read point keep state church, way around True, never know say.... test positivity rate 5%. We'll get kick virus ass! Thanks this! Really helpful see hospital utilization. Administration matters lot national emergencies. US Citizens got complacent resulted someone bullshitting way White House. November 3 important. much focus Individual heroism, guys need institutional heroism. Poor Tokyo. wants host Olympics Games. It’s still ways next summer maybe things change point. Unlikely doesn’t mean certain. Cases well lot uptick comes rural areas burn quickly. We've got mask order almost everyone see Denver metro wearing them. feel like things pretty stable we'll see. Well know virus heavily age-stratified IFR ~10% thought was. average risk young adult fraction percent previously expected.

So yeah, makes total sense friend human  Friendly reminder herd immunity byproduct strategy, that, noted article, partial herd immunity helps slow spread, even though Swedish social distancing pretty good job already. feeling apocalypse happening nothing awkward. also know sisters friend German citizen even though lives US. went Germany vacation summer. feels unfair can’t see loved one. hard one party US vehemently helping need most. instead push help corporations wealthy, ""hoping"" trickles down. Well live small school district sending kid back. can't online guess it'll home schooling. 

We kinda struggling meeting last night one school board members said absolutely send daughter school also county health supervisor. think we're right thing much sucks. christ fire wish would confused different numbers reported. California Department Public Health released numbers yesterday yet. Several news organizations reporting California hit 400k [state's still showing 391k+ 10:30am July 21.  Lmao incredible success. locked three times many deaths per population Sweden. mean look incredible success Sweden turning around numbers restabilizing?  New York failure I'm sure praised. coronavirus got first. Wow...

Or ppl making work. certainly living potentially insurrectionary moment. Get involved political organizations area share ideal. Real change comes below, ruling class.   think team UCLA Medical School know human body works. Agreed. one, deleted couple years ago. Wish never created account first place... data (or be) looking for:

Number cases aged 19 under: 
[Finland: 
[Sweden: 5 times many cases people aged 19 Finland had.

It seems article OP pure fucking bullshit. irony comment fucking hilarious. I’m American citizen girlfriend German citizen. met boarding school America got separated spring break quarantine began. patiently waited able see eachother avail. senior, last year together. much love really want able see again.
I saw post Instagram petition allow couples reunite hashtag #loveisnottourism. tried calling embassy see possibility won’t pick up. anyone heard anything this? way see her? *I know right!? thought thing supposed Easter!* Everyone knows T-cells now. 

What know whether right subset T-cells help immunity.  Killer T's Helper Ts B-cells.

What's sort depressing unlikely we'll T-cell test distributed. actually suck blood isolate.... going know status regular immune cells wane. Since you’re serious, ask questions? virus _can_ deadly, many people die many lasting damage – agree that, right?

So looks like talking [this interesting things that. 

Former SARS patients interviewed assessed ""to determine presence psychiatric disorders chronic fatigue problems""  somehow conclusively tied SARS.

If amputation, might indeed depressed 6 months line interview me. depression would medically caused amputation, right? 

But interesting part - regression analysis suggested health care worker time SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12- 9.39; P = .03), unemployed follow-up (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.50-14.78; P = .008), perception social stigmatization (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.20-7.60; P = .02), applied SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22; P = .02) associated increased risk psychiatric morbidities follow-up, **whereas application SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.07-6.51; P = .04) associated increased risk chronic fatigue problems.** 

So apparently SARS survivors' fund. imagine eligible money suffer serious effects result SARS infection.

And ""surprisingly"", correlation people applied money people reported suffering psychiatric issues and/or famously hard-to-diagnose Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

Ultimately one recognize fear can’t possibly main factor would involve level trust science warnings issued virus. seen constant theme disaster even government authorities enlightened areas (like Los Angeles) don’t seem appreciate threat virus presents they’re suffering worst consequences. 

The general public simply doesn’t believe warnings, even faced incontrovertible evidence like videos people filling hallways ventilators churn away overcrowded hospitals.

Also understand phrase : "" estimate large epidemic prevented efficacy measures exceeds 50%. slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce peak number diagnoses attack rate affect timing peak ""

What mean efficacy? People wash hands wear masks diligently 50% spread events averted? get number from?

Also model doesnt take account parts society social distancing possible, f.e. workplaces. corrected model this?

UK Phase 3 started 2 months ago.  Like tsunami stupidity Let's say take 10% military budget put towards medicare medicaid.

That's 5% increase programs. seem like major game changer?

Or let's say take 10% military budget add previous stimulus bill.

It goes $2.2 trillion $2.27 trillion. That's ~3% increase.

Would anyone noticed 3% increase? sorry. heart breaking teacher experiencing this. Teachers work hard, often underappreciated undercompensated... Clearly phase 3 run. article makes think has? ""fail"" talking about?

Also look [this report Oxford 2 days results Phase I/II trial published today scientific journal, *The Lancet*, indicate early safety concerns induces strong immune responses parts immune system.

Note say Phase I/II results published 2 days ago. Phase III finished yet. fact, Phase III run globally, global programme made Phase III trial US enrolling 30,000 patients, paediatric study, well Phase III trials low-to-middle income countries including Brazil South Africa already underway. Yeah, USA rly big population \s refuse release acknowledge data UK.

What evidence trials Brazil using 2 doses ? find zero evidence reading indicates using protocols UK single dose.

You appear making things up. It’s likely going rough day fatalities. We’re going sail clear beyond 1k mark. Today already 889 nothing California like 70% Texas still out. assume opposite president says. what...are actual number cases x10 that? X20? Considering death rate virus never happen. sure relevant scientists doctors, doesn’t make big difference general public though. cause irreversible heart damage get them, don’t know Covid-19 actually die heart problems caused flu. cases right away. That's matter opinion. opinion? USA play political teeter-totter every time there's election. new president whatever party reverses work done predecessor opposite party.  4-8 years zero progress every election. many presidents run healthcare platform? How's working us? many 8-year time spans left live? 

We go nowhere country. infrastructure, it, crumbling. pay taxes things like ""Homeland Security"" can't even manage pandemic well countries tiny fraction resources. go day. Healthcare, education, infrastructure, childcare, etc. We're left behind countries actually get shit done move future.

Freedom? make laugh. anonymous federal officers Portland, soon cities, snatching people streets exercising constitutional right protest. Many fellow Americans cool this. 

This country born anymore long citizens going in-fight politicize literally everything, never be. short, we're decline considering we've heading direction decades, much hope there's president who's going fix it. lot people lack self control. really excuse selfish actions going Disney World, precautions taken higher level help avoid Mouse temptation.

Exactly. clear case enticement. encouraging spread virus personal short term profit. Ostrava lovely city full nice people it’s definitely West Virginia part Czech Republic Well, this, is, awful tell you... hard headed coaches are... completely shocked decision. PHASE 3 STARTED LESS MONTH AGO. LITERALLY SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE RESULTS YET. Perhaps “serial killer” would better analogy here, since single murderer isn’t necessarily going kill again; perhaps socioeconomic conditions lead increase murders general. case, parallels comes authorities respond (seeing threat public health/public safety) well individuals respond (staying away supposedly dangerous areas vs. social distancing).

I guess point trying make this: odds dying small and/or percentage people died die small, doesn’t mean things ok it’s big deal people die.

(Of course one might reasonably question economic costs costs preventative measures, point measures taken response might indeed harm good e.g. war drugs, metaphor isn’t really aimed people simply different beliefs pragmatics don’t disagree lives matter.)

But again, maybe hypothetical people would really care people getting murdered either, care either case?

(But _then again_, maybe _are_ people think ~~are Smart™~~ mastered dark art Statistics™ therefore worldly matters life death, probably need dose common sense put things perspective.) think American Life reenactment arrest. remember saying names story sounds familiar. Cytokine storms much specific syndrome cascade pro-inflammatory signaling different systems without appropriate mitigation - treatment may helpful therapy treating cytokine storm caused situations, treatment always contextually considerate. Yeah makes sense! Boomers, bars open first place?

Because govt shuts bars, boomers come support measures. \~forcing\~ allowing bars open, counting patrons show up, absolve responsibility, soon second wave blamed young generation.

Too cowardly make hard decisions. hell name daughter reality winner? Lol, repeat guarantee even give basic outline countries doing. vaccines need boosters. speak English mf don’t care much Disney don’t follow it. need open mind read comments. Yeah believe SARS looking like big scare controlled spread, interest vaccine dissipated funding efforts. reading failure/success rates drugs phase testing started investing pharmaceutical companies numbers really opened eyes drugs damn expensive hit market. majority drugs never make market. something shocking like 80-85% (can’t remember exactly encourage look yourself) never make chance failure increases phase. top that, make market, seen dozens of, “have loved one taken...” commercials drugs end failing.

All leads wanting jockey position line take rushed vaccine, especially comes insane timeline 12-18 months epidemiologists threw incredibly optimistic best case scenario started. Eh, lot beachtown residents don't. can't remember last time anything besides get food going beach (pre-COVID, go days), safely drive (or, frankly, well-timed doordash delivery).

That's say actual issues going beach (bathrooms, parking lots) better place people refuse lockdown than, say, hosting house parties. LOL aaaaaand fired me. Apparently complaining shit makes me, ""not team player"". Good luck, fuckers. Another factor we're testing lot people now. tested March April, would've found lot cases would've still number deaths, making case:death ratio look higher.

Meanwhile, we're still seeing 1k people die day ""not many deaths"" bit false comfort. still way many unnecessary deaths ""A little fatigue"" case 1) little fatigue, chronic 2) dig likely lot reasons resulting vascular damage, lungs impairs oxygen transport LIFE muscles impairs strength brain results decreased neural function manage get PE stroke.

Damn y'all heartless bitches splitting hairs what's exactly causing what, hyped arguing exact numbers, forgetting entirely top shit healthcare workers (as well average American) go going wreck LOT lives matter way cut cake.

Whaaat. cares? Honestly dont, maybe make players humble less political. lot workplace outbreaks.

China also accomplished “getting virus control” likely series human rights violations numbers bluffing.

Neither two countries done right thing. Literally one said masks stop 100% transmission. reduce amount droplets contain virus escaping mask infecting others, also offering protection non-infected mask wearers also wear one.

It irony, sincere, either. 10%... Well, economy actually crashed hard oil war Russia Saudi Arabia. dropped price oil less cost gather night. pandemics impact economy great main cause downturn.

Did say supported actions pandemic specifically say support them? Prior country fabulously almost four years. 

You act like support years prior somehow tainted current actions. know would pandemic would blunder it. time machine could've least given us heads Rona. compete insanity. Glad CT. got fucked April held strong contained shit 40% toward education y’all dumb fuck. like 100s patients, basically staff Arizona take care sick people. course New Mexico also struggling. I'm wondering whose taxes going pay travel. ""I wish [Trump] would get political arena""

Me too, Dr. Fauci! think it'd helpful provide fact-checking alongside whatever says. suggestions he's downright dangerous. 

I agree wrong show says, even show entirety. found watching full pressers interesting, frustrating innacurate. Usually media picks one two things per speech writes articles those. miss stuff think useful know POTUS doing, like times kept reading long names companies apparent purpose (except, assume, provide free advertising). embarrassment.  Despite says, deep knows going 'go away', least election time. hail mary Hydroxychloroquine banking pan out. 'warp speed' vaccine arrive time save him. 

He ""I closed travel China"" card play, needs something else, point, pushing masks he's got left. he'll say entire time. call whoever want. Sorry upsets little flower. Grow up. Sorry logical argument trying find different way attack without addressing argument. Maybe learn make logical argument instead name calling. Could different strain virus less deadly. idiot governor says control. Looks like he's least facing music degree. Reopening quickly main reason we're facing major issues containing disease. pushing reopening time European countries already flattened curve, nowhere near point states, exposing hundreds thousands people need exposed. point thing?

He wants public feel ease.  totally unshakable

You never know...he might accidentally insult Mussolini KKK. They're alarmists think healthcare workers think though? Announcement timed stock market closure course. Yeah. hitting bad. agricultural jobs get wiped clean due climate change, well global food shortage worry one, US would crippled. really looking good. Corona brief reprieve constant emissions, take opportunity right now, it'll nothing.  Eh, I'd rather take social distancing district-wide lockdowns, especially since Germany's body pile around twice high Sweden's.  ""He reiterated claim virus would “disappear,” something public health officials infectious disease experts dispute.

“The virus disappear. disappear,” said.""

I'm reminded Princess Bride, [You Keep Using Word, Think Means Think Oh shit, highschool football Texas' favorite creepy thing way obsessed over. We're back thousand deaths day, took Slob long. Oh meant add one mindful lol even spreading like crazy rural parts.  Stay safe there. :( family never really came lockdown, we're gonna keep hunkered down. Fauci gonna like Terence Howard Iron Man 2... Damn right. peaked. Similar pattern everywhere. think that's low, especially looking excess deaths occurred. always, counterpoint look happens hospitals overwhelmed. death rate climbs.

There many disasters low death rate, still really horrific go through, even surviving it. keeps like expect discussing Mississippi along Florida Texas. Better Article

 ""americans""

a nice way politicians asking public idea float...  everybody's bankrupt, nobody's bankrupt! point suspicious ongoings investigation Rick Scott? point unprecedented acts happened investigation happened before?

Fascinating mind college kid real life experience works. would fun case study Psych classes. I've always wondered drives people believe conjecture willingly purposefully steer away fact finding reinforce narrative. haven’t watched all, wouldn’t surprised President called COVID-19 / coronavirus. We’re going August, he’s still calling offensive / obsolete name. 🤷🏼‍♂️ would goofie work it’s going august/september run small family business. state mask mandate comes health department. department inspects kitchens. 

If someone got food poisoning establishment, would get inspected fail, would considered negligent duty care customer would grounds sue. 

If someone gets sick covid, would prove jury business negligent order win suit. Pretty much would prove business actively enforcing health department mask mandate, could easily done cell phone video/photo. Allowing unmasked individuals building health department requires masks negligence. 

There exceptions allowed reopen. reasonable accommodation made without endangering welfare well-being staff customers. refuse service press charges anyone creates problems.

I would also like add, fuck uneducated anti-mask rednecks, could opened months ago people. Instead 30+ people unemployed $500,000 lost revenue. Admissions ~50% since last week June

COVID-19 Census 14% last 8 days

COVID-19 Ventilators 12% last 5 days

COVID-19 ER visits 38% last 2 weeks.

Free non-surge beds back 15% Bro like forcing get tattoo something. mandating masks places prevent spread. want people put masks near others public. non issue idea everyone fighting tooth nail. wear mask save lives. takes 2 seconds put take off. Yea, clear. completely understand. reducing military spending mean deleting navy patrols south china sea. maintain threat without dropping shit tons cash already highly function fighting force every year. money would much better suited sciences healthcare. Things people need. Yes, China threat. Yes, military intervention one sole thongs keeping PRC line. mean forgo long term issues one big spooky military power already tabs on. mean might surprise know Greta doesn't. mask orders weeks ago working?  read anything 'interference' process? 

I saw article can't find it. can't even remember source seemed like BS something serious. Google history useless thought sounded interesting. would help America could use military help provide support

 American servicemen can’t deployed inside America including doctors Yet people won’t wear mask yet hold him. That’s oxymoron. also acknowledge testing pretty bad NY's outbreak vs today's testing situation. California ton testing even test asymptomatic people feel like getting tested. can't really go NY's numbers chances tons cases tested numbers many, many times higher compared states. also, likely death rate fairly steady across states (new treatments demographics could alter it, probably majorly) would also suggest many uncounted cases NY. would suggest NY actually way worse cases deaths, accurate case numbers look (death numbers hopefully little accurate, harder hide body test somebody) filter exhaust. takes asshole others. 🤦‍♀️  Yeah, NY realistically could've 100000 new cases day understood many countries special health care workers, dealing tracing. would say tracing WAY harder do, never done idea, things spread.  


So doctors/nurses/other health care workers better understanding contact even begin! time cancel Disney? Ghibli life!! understand application specific use nothing culling? pedantic."
