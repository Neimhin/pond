By way, outdoor spread less air circulation among things. I‚Äôve seen nothing supporting whatever UV-C you‚Äôre claiming, something explaining that, would love read it. even attempt one? Look G's eyes find darkness shallow graves observation factually wrong, period. states - never mind counties / parishes - peak hospitalizations met exceeded US. incredibly tragic child died. really got school‚Äôs former band director lost battle COVID weeks ago. wife also died virus days later.

Back day would use hair dryer simulate fever. Israel young population compared western countries good chunk population eligible till recently insane. remember beginning AHA estimated 450,000 thousand people would die US thought, surely bad way it'll bad, that's unbelievable. Instead we've averaged 1,000 people day dying beginning pandemic date. even vaccine we're back number, Florida knowledge even reporting deaths moment.

The idea many people would refuse part relatively small number people casting aspersions basic pandemic hygiene...  months ago, flat since. Again,  NPIs (though many decline phase), without reproductive rate would higher therefore growth would exponentially rising.

Don‚Äôt stingy! good man, Garth Brooks! good man would also factor many things: relative ventilation school, prevalence covid area, seropositivity area well (how many people probably already form immunity thru infection/vaccination).

A good chunk?  Um.........no. Genuinely thought like 6 delta fully understood, remarkably, reports vaccination improve long COVID. First article emphasize anyway - got COVID vaccinated, still get vaccine anyway able to. share screen thing. slack chat thing. Surface transmission really isn‚Äôt thing, especially minutes. You‚Äôre fine. like that. Im put tongue yer ass Unfortunately alot people family got sick covid vaccinated‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs antivaxers getting sick recall mentioning US accident mortality rate. comparing mortality recent years UK accident rates, clearly stated, implying mortality media hysteria worthy compared something another first world country goes largely unnoticed majority.

However, looking latest 7 day average around double UK rate, suggesting accident rate likely ballpark. 

Either way, still disproportionate media hysteria, wanted convey.

However, seem upward curve now, I'll admit looking good. reply suggests number questions, including issue, needing increased vaccination vulnerable people, also everyone taking self-responsibility (government action must included) completely unreported major causal factor lifestyle. 

This exciting headline, certainly biggest thing majority could done vaccination, even remains important vaccination reducing symptomatic disease consequently viral load spread.

Sorry rant. Shit pisses off‚Ä¶. think viral load Delta's trump hard here. Everybody feared vaccine evasion via spike protein mutation (which actually hard virus effectively do), evolved much simpler solution.

Exponentially increase viral load. Increased viral load seems multiple benefits virus...

1. Quicker infection rate smaller window exposure.
2. Worse disease outcome unvaccinated virus replicate quickly overwhelm natural defense (and prior immunity) quickly.
3. Cause sickness younger unvaccinated patients like children previously able shake infection symptoms.
4. Overwhelm response fully vaccinated patients create higher number breakthrough cases (that still easily defeated) due virus replicating quicker even improved immunity it. vaccine evasion per-se, simply vaccinated body's response trained respond quickly enough.
5. Spread infinitely higher rate due higher viral load shed everyone, including even asymptomatic vaccinated.

This simple solution that, ironically, one directly predicted discussing variants. Training body stronger boosters (especially focus targeting delta effectively) may key.

It's almost like bad Dragon Ball plot new enemy shows nowhere that's simply stronger faster instantly overwhelms Goku's previous hyped transformation/power level Goku trains (more people vaccinated given boosters) catch back crush new opponent (delta) new overwhelming level.

Daily deaths hospitalisations seem flat manageable. Vaccinations keep progressing, though slowed since we've probably got near ceiling adults keen, that's high level compared countries - 89.5% adults first dose, 77.5% doses. Vaccination opening 16 &amp; 17 year olds end week.

Everything open now, we've got full stadiums back football games gigs happening again. Anecdotally almost everyone know basically living normally except masks public transport, there's feeling people put behind now. friends covid recently due least one dose mild cases sniffles basically.

60% US vaxed various levels protections. can't said countries.  shit obvious you‚Äôve recently studied microbiology infectious diseases past 10 years understand vaccines work. 

Vaccines lessen blow initial infection: don‚Äôt make impervious virus you‚Äôre still capable host replication error produces new, worse strains. 

This always needed multipronged approach (masks, hand hygiene, mandatory vaccination). problem much shit outsourced PPE requirements make damn hard effectively put public health response prioritize health care workers o. front line. start openly theorizing COVID killed medication/ventilator/pre-existing condition/blood clot/etc Isnt whole point vaccine? Yeah possibly. I've working entire pandemic taking transit work crowded food plant Ontario. Fully vaccinated see I'll avoid getting delta often I'll probably end getting even knowing like said Yeah, studies indicate Delta something else. 

So, uncertainties booster really going make difference resistance virus faces, evolves creates variants. Pasco County Fire Rescue made similar plea.

But consider good news. Company WA also req. vaccinations office - Internal (""claimed"" via website - vax passport) vax rate 99% already... start given vaccine away, nearly enough. 

WHO wants 10% country fully vaxed taking boosters. makes sense me. 

Those vaxed already protection. world outside developed countries need vaccine more. article says, right.   Based what?

Oh wait, already got that. I'll take booster well months case.  won't. unvaxed unmoved got shot take covid seriously might want mask again.

Also, world FDA would drag feet? make statements like information goes ear ear, shape shifting. comment took quite cognitive swerve doomsville haha believe Taliban outlawed vaccines, remember correctly. Hopefully change minds. Emphasize still need wear masks vaccinated helps cut transmission. Less vaccinated people getting infected slows reduces risk mutation allows new strain emerge evade antibody response produced vaccine. article similar politico says confused boosters many countries even 10% vaxed.

Quick edit: Pfizer/Moderna show data lab studies. Real data like using real world information. Thats think well peak surge terms cases may happen next week peak terms deaths 2 - 3 weeks behind. 130 - 170 per day (7 day average) expect become 200 - 250 per day (7 day average) 2 - 3 weeks.

I genuinely think would get bad. Florida robust vaccination rates among 65+ folks - still remain vulnerable. data looked suggests CFR 65+ folks went 9% 4% (even &lt;65 CFR went 0.3% 0.2%). However, delta variant infecting far people - one potential explanation delta burning unvaccinated population... Gives time hide bodies I'm interested too. I've seen news would expect like five potentially one none mattered yet would start now. There's helping Yeah, better declined polio vaccine too, want take seriously Could please provide source I've CNAs family close friend mine currently working CNA.

I think it‚Äôll take return pre pandemic, wfh convenient waking 8:30 instead 7:00, spending transport lunch. try come office week, 2 max. something change FL (US) reporting deaths? Deaths seemed start surge right behind infections weeks ago dropped next nothing (at least looking worldmeters data). missing something?   think preventing infection goal? never said would need modified vaccines prevent death. effects body death itself, even know yet. breakthrough Covid right moderna. Give stats! Lovely reassuring stats please. feel really really sick. think vaxxed I‚Äôd dead. I‚Äôm 40 two kids age 9.

Then new information came accepted wrong changed behavior. feel bit silly. information available I'd still make decisions. shame that. 26.

They third population US much, much smaller area.
They however, think rest community ideal world, vaccines would induce sterilising immunity. reality, actually extremely difficult produce vaccines stop virus infection altogether. vaccines routine use today achieve this.

This explanation Dr Caddy seems flush me. person responded said child 6.... lost something??

I'll ask again, state? ever get covid hospital, want live stream 24/7. People need see awful is. It‚Äôs reason people vote particularly apathetic party - don‚Äôt understand situation, think somehow they‚Äôll one ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù end. agree. live SC, it‚Äôs frustrating hear governor say things like ‚Äúlet parents make choices deciding what‚Äôs best kids, know what‚Äôs best.‚Äù Boy many parents _NOT_ know what‚Äôs best kids. Ignorance begets ignorance, trusting uninformed parents make informed decisions regarding child‚Äôs safety wishful thinking. wish way gain trust anti-maskers anti-vaxxers try win see reason, can‚Äôt think it. feels hopeless, watching friends family still acting like COVID isn‚Äôt big deal.  name really apply outside Panama City. Everything else longer cheap gentrified quite bit past couple decades. Even PCB heading way. getting shot, yes, kind shot like everyone got go kindergarten.

A small correction here, mRNA shots actually better, safer shots potential far wider application Interesting thanks insight. 

I'm almost wondering we're going see something similar want see could prevented School stuff like NFL season start spreads fast burns populous runs places. horrible we're going see much damage process.  I'm sure there's enough fill nice thick book. mRNA flu vaccines way, it‚Äôs likely won‚Äôt live flu much longer. leave school last bell write blackboard 100 times:

""Vaccines prevent infection, prevent getting sick bug."" That‚Äôs felt highly vaccinated area delta, delta even area isn‚Äôt vaccinated enough. Still nice months less feeling freer Pfizer authorized 12 up. old enough. 49 / 50 states things one way, 50th something makes deaths seem fewer less severe surge, I'm going go intentionally trying mislead. 

Its like they've upfront honest whole time. they're announcing deaths. They're backdating hoping one notices. sketchy fuck. read article, vaccinated 46% adults far. cautious vaccines aren‚Äôt magical pandemic ending tool right now

Which important bit messaging many folks either received, wish believe. Vaccines important, panacea, one tool multi-layered strategy. Unfortunately removed s10, since watches now. Wow amazing, turns people capable using risk assessment &amp; want avoid catching virus Florida well Three likely completely broken families; siblings growing without missing one; Christmases, holidays birthdays terribly tainted forever best, outright unbearable; parents living with, consumed by, ""what-if"" guilt regret rest lives try hide pain tears little ones might left. 

I'm blown away folks trivialize/minimize deaths children dying. 24/7 staffing, food, supplies. People like reason everyone could get vaccinated, should. Cite sources stop spreading disinformation. I‚Äôm split right middle think sides push bullshit line pockets.
That said, live, nobody know said wouldn‚Äôt get something flipped president change. Also never saw ad left. Please present video. No. redneck Jedi going feel one. Thought question: don‚Äôt know much medical field understand well statistics love passion science well scientific method particular.
I‚Äôve noticed huge steer away statical driven reporting last 12 months see TV hear radio anecdotal evidence virus feared.
My question mortality. Current numbers Canada since beginning: 1.46M cases, 1.41M recovered, 26 761 deaths.

Since virus symptoms often go unfelt mild measure account unreported cases?

Secondly, case numbers ones tested confirmed? friend‚Äôs husband caught COVID, tested positive didn‚Äôt test friend (his wife) virus quarantined together never tested. case go uncounted?

Lastly, counts COVID death? know, Plague would usually choose India starting country low hygiene, massive population international travel made great breeding disease.

If update game include vaccine hesitancy factor, would switching U.S. ‚ÄúSummer season.‚Äù DeSantis, probably. I'm small Texas town ICU is. full week. canceling surgeries. little town goes business.

Ah yes, online forum covid19 filled vaccine experts. Sue, win. currently live US it‚Äôs terrible place lack valuing human life.

Well, regions already started already mess. 

At least district dad works requiring masks everyone. article text? I'm able view outside US.

It looks like start scenes saw places got fully overwhelmed. hard watch happen. :( amazing numbers. Hoping continue see upward trajectory. That's fine tbh. Outdoor transmission low nonexistent. infuriating...the people choose vax follow public health measures ones pulling kids public schools. 

THEY ones homeschooling children want part health safety community. 

All vaccines/public health safety measures required children attend...short school district members similar ideologies (which problematic itself), reason even basic health safety protocols mandated followed publicly run educational system. Texas: come Texas lower cost living. cost ain't livin' enter venues travel No.  NYC discriminatory, authoritarian, unconstitutional. don‚Äôt want serve them, messed much disagree you, still think it‚Äôs constitutional right PRIVATE business owner it‚Äôs business. Would still get sued? likely. call, individual made decision. 

However, isn‚Äôt case NYC. NYC government mandated. Private businesses shouldn‚Äôt told government can‚Äôt serve. It‚Äôs illegal. Leave individuals make decisions business.  Well, look last 18 months compare expert predictions vs actual cases deaths, would say experts predicted cases similar deaths actually locations. Nobody really knows covid outbreaks dynamics do, think consistent theme tended peak fade sooner people would expected based mathematical modeling. think big part massively under-estimating cases time. Florida \~25k new cases day average right now, that's confirmed positive tests. ""real"" number new cases per day inferred 20% positive test rate easily excess 150k maybe many 250k/day. even half floridians vaccinated started, something order 750k 1.5 million new infections happening every week. rates imply two big facts: mortality virus LOT lower previous waves, decline soon. many many new susceptible people infect. Makes sense. Thanks. they‚Äôre doubly vaxxed, I‚Äôm worried spreading children. chances actually spread child low begin with, chance child actually severe case low. minimal risk something don‚Äôt even think daily life. 

Driving kid school higher risk that, it‚Äôs unbelievable people aren‚Äôt able comprehend that. you‚Äôre comfortable driving kid school, comfortable around doubly vaccinated teacher hey went Disney land, risk calculations working well, taking issue far less risky two behaviors simply it‚Äôs news, there‚Äôs logic behind it. could sick days that, I'm going what's reported. know delta contiguous sure lethality compared first varient. That's unfortunate. sad state affairs society good guys considered villains.

Is 70% level based something, random moment politicians say well done? That's dumb statement. obviously overlap people infected people vaccinated really depends lot factors. vaccines still work less effective time delta variant countries vaccinated level fairly likely vaccine resistant strain appear eventually rapidly viruses evolve. Provided get booster jabs account though still able hit herd immunity might take while. need arguing someone refuses get shot. words wasted me. I'll first one line booster I'm eligible.  way around likely well. infected, later vaccinated, essentially 3 shots first one real deal. studies experts incredibly transparent this. Infection becomes likely time remain mild cases. suggestion isn‚Äôt avoid boosters together. 8 month immunity comment replied completely false fabricated. continue focus vaccinating people first time, shift attention boosters trial data leads us there. We‚Äôd see better results involved. Delta used Extreme Evoboost! ......okay, nerdy, even me. Wowza slow reply.

It far foregone conclusion variant going able get around vaccines, target spike protein. Given spike protein virus latches cells, can‚Äôt change much still able infect us. limits mutations, nobody knows are.

On top that, mRNA vaccines quickly updated variants. far, hasn‚Äôt necessary. Delta doesn‚Äôt really evade vaccine, 1000x higher viral load ovewhelms antibodies get sick. memory T/B cells don‚Äôt get severely ill make antibodies targeted specifically delta (or variant). hope vivekis sarcastic making fun idea getting 4th+ dose quickly. tells us herd immunity, be. end coronavirus, continue circulate around forever, everyone get vaccinated every year, unvaccinated, unlucky weak catching anyway.

Just flu kills tens thousands year U.S., coronavirus. We'll get used forget it, long term effects die. Personally, pregnant, risk would probably safe open, uncrowded area.. I'm doctor. definitely ask doctor risk infection problems could occur relation pregnancy.. make smart decisions baby's wellbeing. Wish best luck! true. I'd say pandemic far here. 

Cases plateauing, steadily rising last two half weeks imagine increase even sharply schools go back two weeks. Along this, hospitalisations deaths rising too. 7 day average deaths already 93 day. 

People still wearing masks shops, supermarkets, public transport albeit less before. experience still around 50% people wearing masks situations. 

The situation okay considering almost restrictive measures anymore. think autumn winter difficult see cases, hospitalisations, deaths rises already much higher hoped considering high vaccination levels are. know went. teacher though, vaccinated really close anyone vulnerable, really reason worry. know who's class. There's real possibility one students could immunocompromised unaware it. Additionally know covid permanently debilitating effects anyone get infected. teachers threat health safety students that's unacceptable. watch? cousin's husband died covid get see last 13 days alive. people dying 'off screen'.

However, point ... people never care. like think vast minority though. Wtf talking about? not. literally talking people vaccinated. Literally people 100% fully vaccinated. talking currently - right now. current hospital patients less 1% fully vaccinated suffering noteworthy case covid19 Fox News headquarters building vaccine passport system inside everyone works there.   Doh. actually intended reply someone else. Lol. Yeah, you‚Äôre right. 

That said, 75% eligible people shots. And, recall, 60-65% total population fully vaxed. Kids haven‚Äôt shots yet, UK slower US open vaccines teens.  Slightly half total Delta UK deaths fully vaccinated over-50s. large majority rest come tiny portion unvaccinated over-50s. Vaccinated 30-50s unvaccinated under-30s tiny portions death tally. high vaccination 30-60 age bracket makes starkly different countries.

[Page 18 Delta variant kill people faster wild-type COVID? sounds strange average time first symptoms death wild-type month. think poor girl anomaly, I've heard adults dying really quickly Delta too.  edited make clear. aren't. one spreading disinformation here. Well according Revolting MTG, ""We can't live forever"" (when asked hospitals). short, point, fit easily sign t-shirt. think winner there. know live land free all, see Singapore hold virus compared US get pretty angry. everyone actually worked together would much less bad Hard feel bad then. Especially line work.

I like jaded pandemic made me, point that's feel. Ohh yes...our governor basically ""no numbers = cases = action health districts take"". counties 20,000 allowed publicly report info/data. approximately 17 counties 93 allowed report. extra counties ""reporting"" based counties tied within lovla health department.

For example, one county health department 20,000 4 counties health department region less 20,000 data cumulative 14 day average county 20,000+ people. 

So yeah. data...not like anywhere big cities would put mandates place anyway. Even Omaha one public school system mask mandates grade levels. Every day guys get insane talking science like it‚Äôs god  airlines already implemented vaccine mandate? least employees actually travel. Oh see. Dallas, county judge attempting take simple safety measures, protestors outside private
home. seems like people trying right thing fear safety. Bc vaccinated breakthrough cases mild. Asymptomatic cases prob arent caught, really matter? 99.9% deaths unvaxed. Ppl gonna catch covid, going spread. vax works. Person living London here. Definitely feels like pandemic here. pubs nightclubs open seemingly restrictions. lots big festivals events going time. still meant wear masks public transport seem enforced national mandate lot people it. Shopping centres, supermarkets etc seem busy people still choosing wear masks (including myself).

The area still real restrictions international travel, expense book private tests real control providers issue. countries long fully vaccinated quarantine now. Life really feel like back normal here.  data shows massive decline antibodies thus far. riding information provided trials part, followed mass vaccinated. community agrees might eventually need form booster trying get ahead it. problem aren‚Äôt yet, I‚Äôm suggesting 8 months categorically false we‚Äôve seen. focus vaccinating yet get vaccinated help substantially moment get booster. 

If find data suggesting need booster X months since vaccination, I‚Äôd happy entertain it. I‚Äôm happy vigilant watching it. can‚Äôt pretend good data suggesting give everyone third jab now, especially others need right now. state website breaks vaccination rates covid cases county. This. person schooling essentially new viral pandemic mind bogglingly stupid idea. nooooo, one appetite implement preventative measures, responding shit hits fan. shitty title. vaccines still provide protection noted article.

What's shitty it? evidence suggests delta better sneaking past vaccines original strain was. comments repeatedly trying change subject infection severe-illness/death... that's point. 

The data study (and one linked ) explain even highly vaccinated populations would still wise wear masks &amp; limit large gatherings. I've become frustrated obsession giving vaccines credit they're due. Vaccines provide incredible protection ending hospital cemetery (even via delta), suffice halt spread delta. That's point article. Depends area living, 99% people wearing masks. Maybe upmarket middle-class areas see masks generally, pandemic basically UK.  vaccines using India working better ones US? matter vaccinated population vs unvaccinated? numbers seem indicate things better control US ATM.

Basically, vaccine issue social issue? equate ""beating"" Covid erradicating it, bad news everyone.  Someone coronavirus subreddit un-ironically telling masks work. doctor would get whatever one before, data Pfizer also looks great. see future data combo.. mix match much harder judge future study going 2 shots pfizer 1 shot moderna quite time ever.  Yeah, long covid biggest personal concern. I'm surprised people traveling internationally long covid infection could mean stuck quarantining another country potentially months. I'm sure there's enough evidence benefits 3 months justify 3rd shot unless reason particular risk. something like working job let wear mask serving people wear masks, maybe there's reason look more. 

But wear mask social distance, 2 shots enough protection 3 months risk long covid tiny enough tiny risks severe side effects could large enough matter. understanding, may small drop effectiveness transmissions 3 months, really noticeable 5 months. think there's studies directly looking prevention infection long-covid 3rd shots, even really know benefit would be. think fair assume it'll least good fresh 2nd shot though, would want get shot every 3 months maybe someone studies this? i'm virologists, supposed figure stuff previous head CDC says 100% came lab opinion Fauci South Park tell came people banging pangolins. 

But also, escaped lab wild bats, jump bats humans. 

I doubt we're ever going know really happened. get go beaches winter Florida. summer heat unbearably bad get mean afternoon lightning storms.  got arrested murder child endangerment. entitlement response telling. That's stupid stat looking deaths hospitalizations covid since start pandemic (i.e. way vaccines even available vast majority cases occurred). misleading. vein, could give every 2nd person ""magic potato"" today tomorrow I'll say 99% covid deaths since start pandemic people without magic potato happen US delta us. know US couldn‚Äôt come close vaccinations unfortunately.  That‚Äôs definitely true. live flight path CareFlite helicopters take it‚Äôs constant back forth Dallas hospitals rural areas night long. f move Florida? Link reddit post: That‚Äôs still oversimplifying it. 

The factor even larger population risk hospitalised first place even higher vaccination rate 

For example 80+ double vaccinated individual likely get hospitalised unvaccinated 20 year old. 

I believe factor around 25 factor reduction hospitalisation compare matched group vaccinated vs unvaccinated people Don‚Äôt give ideas. news, Florida Texas double stupid. What's next, arrest warrants anyone going hospital? Oh cool actually think there's lot could done developing therapeutics (both inpatient outpatient - e.g., antivirals taken home soon tests positive, help keep people hospital) daily rapid antigen (later flow) test screening workplaces schools. Also: masks. Continuing wear public transport hard, lots people - I'd say 50/50 right even despite mask requirement, enforced. 

Governments everyone banked vaccines ticket pandemic - amazing help get us path normalcy, actually yet. problem 'what else do?' attitude prevents investment things would help get us back normal faster, stands, things looking dicey winter - vaccines enough. Transmission hospitalizations way higher UK last summer, suggests things actually great right we're great place heading autumn. autumn surge would start much higher level hospital pressure last year's did. Herd immunity longer thing delta variant said outbreak. didn‚Äôt say nobody got it. Pay attention.

Also‚Ä¶ google too. Good job explaining 70th million time.  offshoot delta reduce transmissivity might become dominant. delta, become contageous daily PCR test might detect even infected, likely ample opportunity pass others die.

The worry variant delta-variant might make breakthrough infections omre likely.

Delta contagious fast possible even fully vaccinated already it, carrier days without noticing it. Estimates 21% fully vaccinated recovered asymptomatic carriers days. focus adults, people may realize far fewer paediatric care beds exist.

The pandemic numbers game, we're seeing happens small percentage children need hospitalized large number becoming infected. wonder previous generations like this?

""The problem virus [it is] measles. 95% people vaccinated measles, virus cannot transmit population,"" told U.K.'s All-Party Parliamentary Group coronavirus.

Pollard said Covid vaccines might slow spread virus ‚Äî fully vaccinated infected people appeared, studies, shed less virus, giving virus less opportunity spread ‚Äî new variants likely emerge would also spread.

""I suspect virus throw next variant perhaps even better transmitting among vaccinated populations that's even reason making vaccine program around herd immunity."" Andrew Freedman, reader infectious disease Cardiff Medical School, told CNBC Thursday agreed Pollard's assessment herd immunity unlikely.

""The delta variant highly transmissible meaning proportion people needing fully vaccinated herd immunity probably achievable,"" said. ""The vaccines provide effective protection severe disease/hospitalisation/death less effective preventing infection, mild disease transmission, especially delta variant.

Achieving herd immunity comes Covid seen much harder several reasons, including uneven vaccine rollouts, vaccine hesitancy mutation virus, new variants threatening (but yet undermining) Covid vaccine efficacy.

Danny Altmann, professor immunology Imperial College London, told CNBC also agreed Pollard herd immunity mathematical model could easily applied ""unprecedented"" virus like Covid still little understood diverging, globally circulating variants emerging.

""The whole herd immunity thing one bits medical textbook-speak adopted early policy advisors, press, public throughout contorted over-simplified,"" said Thursday.‚Äù


I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre saying vaccines aren‚Äôt worthwhile. vaccinating achieve herd immunity isn‚Äôt possible vaccines prevent severe infection. even conspiratorial federal government footing bill? Thanks pointing out, redditors seem think gerrymandering un-counterable cheat code eternal power reality strategically spreading thin possible. Probably 9 would probably 50. 
(I asked question day forum that‚Äôs data shown) number pretty underreported tho. positivity percentage pretty high given don‚Äôt test much, even 25k cases undercount. even 25k cases, 26 deaths seems low given vaccination rates. It‚Äôs efficient everyone early days, even vaccinated. still takes time even vaccinated body start producing antibodies also beneficial get extra volume antibodies.  


Based anecdotal evidence, Delta extremely transmissible even among vaccinated people ‚Äî different story original. 12 people know went Bay Area Alaska fishing 3 weeks ago, vaccinated, living one rented house, got sick. Mostly mild fevers etc one person went hospital Alaska week. 94% adults. still huge amount kids spread around. replace deny service deny service become 100% believable

Gotta kill many people can. absolutely matters look total deaths case case basis. encounter somebody polio certainly going hesitant around even though total deaths polio overall almost zero. Exposure arguably biggest factor this.

I'm trying argue people get vaccine. sounds like used wrong terminology breakthrough cases. Honest mistake. Yeah Chris Gaines? UK ton test per capita US tho.

Yeah, we're really struggling here. Weep us. countries reliable CDC since day 1.  I'm saying people abandon beaches summer, also packed winter. neither thing matters much covid since that's outside. splashing around beach, head inside get heat summer. heat lasts night. unvaccinated folks indicate larger social issue, going become relevant climate change biosphere collapse create problems coronavirus's scale.

Right now, many anti-maskers loud districts hedging bets stand keep money making anti-maskers happy. revers true, would change tune. Money ultimate motivator capitalistic society.

i didnt get sick, brain/body issues pretty bad.  They‚Äôve pretty much mishandled every aspect pandemic I‚Äôm surprised people still think trustworthy. wonderous web was. Scam strong word, yeah numbers there, *a lot* messaging going around numbers actually comparable (to extent true) vaccines great important compare. 

I get messaging coming from, also think taken far. first saw places university's health services newsletter, pretty quickly spread across social media. got point, circle anyway, felt taboo even say prefer one vaccine other.

When J&amp;J briefly halted blood clot issue saw plenty comments Reddit treating anyone really want J&amp;J like anti-vaxxer. obviously sentiment spilled broader population least extent. 

Of course results narrative changed again, like people pretend certain messaging happen - I've seen mention early mask discouraging CDC. fact incorrect messaging existed justify anybody still idiot today, far it. also hard blame people confused things develop, think desperately need take deep look public communication handled throughout pandemic.  I‚Äôm quoting Fauci experts flat said herd immunity possible delta. linked articles reply below. expert opinion can‚Äôt get herd immunity vaccinated people get transmit covid community transmission keep happening. think maybe shot vaccinations started earlier got 80-90% population variants started emerging. personal opinion vaccine become annual one like flu shot since doesn‚Äôt give long lasting protection. remember that, Garth guest host Chris musical guest.  hiding bodies.. families need closure smh feels depressing March 2020.

Unless vaccine one available   family there, mom, brother, sister law, niece nephew 12. anxiety real. Especially since mother anti-vax, got vaccines 3 years ago age 27, one high school religion teachers going around Facebook offering ""religious exemptions"" vaccine. raised fucking Lutheran. husband vaccinated, dad, step mom, sister brother law get it. like talking brick wall. dad thinks mark beast.

Eligible Israel means 12 years old.

It also help (as now) 8 total serious cases 12-29 year old patients (only 1 vaccinated) means almost serious patients fall ""eligible"" group (as expected due age).

In 60-90 age group serious, fully vaccinated patients non-vaccinated, seriously ill patients, presumably due many unvaccinated people age group. 60-90 practically 60% vaccinated 3 doses 90% two.

Still, look numbers per 100k clear vaccines work. (Seriously ill unvaccinated 182.5/100.000, fully vac 21/100.000) hospitals say uses way many resources can‚Äôt treat people, due sheer amount gun shot wound injuries. hospitals treat gun shot wounds though. Interesting.

Thanks everyone info.   I'm sure Governor (who said schools forcing mask mandates get new funding) going love this! bodies don‚Äôt lie. bad families never know happened missing loved ones. School starts East side less two weeks. wonder people waiting second dose allowed work?

I'm also wondering private school bus companies. local district uses private school bus company bussing. mandate? drivers attendants (special needs busses tend extra attendant two help additional needs) also need vaccinate? 

For record, I'm 100% pro vaccination glad it, I'm wondering much pushback husband going dealing with. They've already hired several drivers places school districts mandated themselves, drivers left. Keep feathering brother. people talk, they'll come running second hear ""welllll got frieeennnddss..."" think vaccination numbers KC would higher (only 35 got vaccinated) would continued tour felt like making positive impact.

Also, like 3-4 weeks ""Delta already burned UK"" reddit mean, plenty governments around world closing schools. children's point view clearly worse close school, though general public health point view might be. Garth really thinking families. bottom cliff ambulance take fallen hospital fence top would better protect community. Free rent They‚Äôre reporting deaths bulk days report like 7 days It‚Äôs like CDC source truth comes pandemic. fact pretty bad it. I‚Äôd rather look data countries, like Israel, painting pretty picture.  There's absolutely evidence vaccines would make anyone sterile. There's also conceivable MECHANISM vaccines could make sterile (the mRNA super fragile make genitals, J&amp;J boring old school tech). also demonstrably false claim: vaccinations started late 2020, August 2021. Women gotten vaccinated pregnant. Studies shown there's zero increased risk miscarriage pregnancy complications among vaccinated. complete horse shit.

OTOH, unvaccinated getting COVID increase risk spontaneous abortion, pre-term labor, death pregnancy. men, COVID cause ED. situation exact opposite: vaccinated absolutely associated fertility pregnancy complications.

Some doctors memorized everything med school, also insane conspiracy theorists.

Not wanting 3rd worlders die = self-righteous, apparently.

I representative, different system someone potentially sacrifice loved ones

Hyperbole. eventually sacrifice leaving majority worlds population unvaxxed reason. Worse variants stay inside

Common insinuating access vaccine boosters kills someone another country RIDICULOUS.

If vaccines could logistically used give first dose injections people can't currently so, would incorrect statement read room.

Why would adapt sincere opinion accommodate people changing minds.

Not job, decide doses going, unless political influence care less whether say pissing people off.

Hey, hey, hey. Maybe already it! I'm aware efficacy vaccines original strains, recent studies shown different numbers due waning immunity light Delta variant. would actually like see rate transmission would booster, especially since early data showed rates 95% original strains. booster bring back 95% (even 85% would good), things go back way months ago.  really sure making point think are. realize different studies time may show us different things, right? That's continue conduct studies. Dang. Yeah shit office twice last year again, everyone gets laid collect ui least. small kids surly teenager thinks pandemic fault.

You say easily avoidable illness, hospitalisations death, that's broad statement. Vaccination certainly makes big difference older comorbidities, offer magic bullet. people still get sick die. However, anyone category avoiding vaccination acting rationally. hand, we've known along healthy people incredibly low mortality even younger are.

Your next statement ""I may care"" unfortunately level conversation reduced to. People can't even civil conversation days without emotional outburst someone else's motives. 

You also missed fact used word ""if"" hospitalisations. seem higher rate expected, although given problem Germany's figures (because slightly ahead vaccination percentage) can't better analysis yet. showing twice rate ICU need ago, difficult address 

So, there's questions here. first is, ICU rate 6.5 people per 100,000 total Covid19 hospitalisations c. 0.025% actually high? first world country able cope extra number considerably without verge collapsing? words, much issue much health service run almost capacity? genuinely know answer that.

The second issue, huge one, known early pandemic biggest risk factor serious illness death Covid19 pre-existing health conditions. course, many unavoidable genetic and/or environmental ills, vaccination always best bet, there's incredibly large section society completely avoidable problems whole time government media pushed message eat better, walk bit and, ultimately, get better control blood sugar associated hormones. subreddit full anger unvaccinated, regardless risk level, read recently one guy boasting able continue heavy smoking vaccinated. see chastisement stupid comment. 

So, stand comment that, looking mortality rate societal level perspective well. ICU admissions straining system beg questions system. Please note, I'm claiming right wrong here, is, least important as, vaccination levels, something look at. seems hard find concrete number US ICU beds search abroad, give international perspective UK sold lockdowns protect health service overrun. health service run close breaking point winter, issue, comparison Germany, one example, half ICU beds per unit population. 

In closing, certainly care lives, whether lost/damaged Covid19 whether lost/damaged via responses virus, indebted future.

So... Yeah... vaccine contraceptive work... Missouri

Nevada Thanks perspective. :) Seems reasonable. Unfortunately seem whole lot solid data one way another this. Hopefully people studying able come meaningful conclusions soon.

Personally, think reasonable assume risk fully vaccinated individuals greatly reduced fully eliminated, like risk hospitalization/death.

I also think reasonable assume mild infection fully vaccinated much likely *genuinely* mild, immune system already primed ready fight threat. Whereas unvaccinated person may likely *appear* mild surface, could silently wreaking havoc behind scenes, later manifests Long COVID symptoms.

But that's personal take it. I'm eagerly waiting actual data know exactly risk level really is. He‚Äôs got friends slow places look like Capitol insurrectionists January 6th. actually believe point, you-know-who going declared president pardon all. far one! definitely journey. Honestly, fucked-up stories I've reading people suffering consequences Covidiots STILL learning lesson, I'm almost surprised kid's death got anti-mask parents shut up. think already say children asking that, considering they're now, covid impacted pretty dramatically.

AZ takes two doses achieve efficacy 1 dose J&amp;J. think 2 doses J&amp;J would best vaccine far I'm really sorry situation. wish best recovery still ongoing.

But can't see drink driving mask wearing moral equivalents - one clearly worse justifies draconian enforcement.  ""pretty much everyone understands virus works"" also claimed 2 doses enough, masks needed anymore, couple months ago. ""I think everyone, unless they're staying home pure lockdown lifestyle...""

My life since March 2020. hate much. agree nursing homes severely understaffed, people still need work (CNAs yet enough experience elsewhere, instance) still need job, forces gat vaccinated. months opportunity get vaccinated, feel sympathy chose get vaccinated. Besides, mandates, give enough time get vaccinated time mandate approved, time goes effect.

Not mention staff taking care vulnerable population, *absolutely need* vaccinated. Vaccine mask mandates. ask question. much due natural waves much due vaccination.

Last lockdown Wellington June last year. Auckland's last lockdown March year. Washington state (at least live), walk local pharmacy without even set appointment, choice Pfizer, Moderna, either AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson (usually one two choice, least pharmacies I've checked). incredibly realistic, demand low right since basically everyone anti-vax already got second shot month ago.

With vaccine mandates jobs around corner, I'd expect would get bit busier soon, however. Since teachers informed advance though, can't see many reasons get first shot within week. second shot, FDA approval, mandates may coming increasing demand vaccination. Regardless, choice getting months ago, feel bad slightest. yeah madness assume US probably comparable worse stats accidents

I see reason would mention US accident rates comparing covid death rates. way, still disproportionate media hysteria, wanted convey.

The media regularly covers things deadly crashes, reason traffic. Given covid kills lot people lot done prevent accidental deaths covid deaths, giving little bit attention covid seems appropriate. completely unreported major causal factor lifestyle.

*The biology behind ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô cases confusing CDC mask guidance.* 
 
The Centers Disease Control Prevention‚Äôs latest Covid guidelines many Americans confused. Vaccinated people supposed resume wearing masks, lest contract spread virus. Yet unvaccinated people still strongly urged get shots, said highly effective. claims true? 
 
The answer there‚Äôs one kind immunity. Internal immunity protects inside body, including lungs. occurs release antibodies Immunoglobulin G type, IgG, blood production T-cells. Vaccines injected muscles highly effective stimulating internal immunity. largely protects vaccinated people overwhelmed coronavirus, unless immunodeficiency exposed unusually large amount virus. Vaccination dramatically reduce likelihood serious illness death you‚Äôre exposed SARS-CoV-2. 
 
In contrast, mucosal immunity provides first line defense protecting nose mouth, also reduces spread others. mucous membranes secrete particular form antibodies Immunoglobulin type, IgA. vaccines injected muscles‚Äîincluding approved inoculations Covid‚Äîare largely ineffective stimulating secretion IgA noses occurs actual infection virus. result, vaccinated people contract Covid-19 infection confined mucous membranes. may get sniffles spread virus others even asymptomatic. That‚Äôs makes sense wear mask circumstances. 
 
All implications public-health authorities‚Äô determination achieve herd immunity vaccination alone. Provincetown, Mass., outbreak, informed CDC‚Äôs recent change guidelines, viral loads nose ‚Äúsimilarly high‚Äù vaccinated unvaccinated, suggesting vaccine‚Äôs efficacy infection nose fallen zero advent Delta variant. would mean herd immunity vaccination impossible.

Vaccines administered via nasal spray exist ailments, including polio. They‚Äôre development Covid-19 supplement existing shots mucosal immunity. meantime, herd immunity may prove difficult achieve unless people get infected develop natural immunity types. Given dangers infection, officials rightly reluctant encourage actual infection, loath mention benefit conferring mucosal immunity. 
 
But shouldn‚Äôt shun people recovered Covid. Vaccine mandates in-person interactions‚Äîwhether imposed governments, employers businesses‚Äîshould make exceptions previously infected, thanks natural mucosal immunity likely less risk never-infected vaccinated people spreading virus others.

Go find another sucker engage, I'm done. Also, really need look deeper viral loads since fully vaxxed person‚Äôs body primed fight infection, could deactivated RNA viral loads fully vaxxed person. Israel data seems show different story. im saying vaccines one tool, full proof people need incorporate measures awhile. Dont assume throw caution wind vaccine. boat.

We're taking risk next month flying Oregon. mostly wilderness alone hiking whatnot. Part wants cancel stay home, really left house since last September even though much home bodies really need get Florida bit.

I'm hoping cna maybe get booster shot go  beach great choice. outdoors. band. Said played flute. Every single adult charge making sure safe, failed. Oh sure agree with, least spread reduced again. sounded like saying shouldn‚Äôt ever gather things like concerts words 94% UK England COVID-19. 

Eventually every human many people refused vaccine wearing masks. point opinion try slow spread getting vaccinated, wearing masks, getting booster / third shots available, work toward better therapeutics eventually effective vaccines stop variants path. mean, boosters. maintain immunity towards COVID-19 vaccination next centuries. course, known.

But mean, done. People get ill, like flu years much less flu, seems much easier vaccinate well corona viruses flu. vaccines keep getting even better. I'm gonna need 'splainer comments. Tommy Buns? Proto? Mommies? Bodies? scientists (Canadians Isaac Bogoch saying months even delta) 3rd booster likely necessary

He said recently hour ago boosters likely necessary immunocompromised though. He's quite vocal ""boosters all"" strategy severely lacking supporting evidence.  money broadcasting, stadium spectators /r/hermancainaward/ Ya pretty much said, see less ideal neutralizing antibodies cells still recognizing variants fine. take vaccines actually meant do.. prevent severe disease ""escaped"". within context preventing infection reduced efficacy. Nursing homes can't find employees hard job pays like shit. started paying $15-20/hr. minimum wage like staffing issue. wife used work nursing home quit mentally/physically/emotionally draining job $10/hr. Yeah kind ironic, believe doctor started lot anti-vax stuff claiming vaccines cause autism UK hah. largely rejected quack UK though, people seem understand importance vaccines. 

Incidentally uptake rates lower minority communities, massive shame. Especially since believe communities got hit harder virus anyway. simply due mistrust authorities, I'm hoping literal example almost rest adult population taken vaccine keeled convince hesitant people get eventually. doesn‚Äôt seem herd immunity covid, least current vaccines and/or natural immunity. Maybe next gen vaccine.

What is, super low deaths. Look UK. Basically universal adult antibodies, high case counts, low deaths.

Wow. claim victory, people flood state spread virus far wide. need understand COVID isn‚Äôt going anywhere, COVID cases years come. main thing vaccinate get fuck life. risks kids minuscule current restrictions really screwed one kids already. Thanks info. Literally virus cause long term symptoms. Literally virus could dangerous immunocompromised person. Viruses mutate, that's viruses do. area looked affluent wife days one August years ago: big nice houses stilts shoreline, large trailers big storage yards, resort hotels. high season redneck-looking close Florida line. Sigh... can't robust source control?

If everyone would wear well-fitting, high-PFE respirator, undergo basic training usage, complied consistently, shit would month.  Would feel better linked WSJ article says 10-30% cases including asymptomatic develop long term symptoms? There's data there. Clearly disagree it, there. Early summer cautiously optimistic Spring 2022. Nope.

Our original trip planned May 2020 yet reschedule. I'm going go back look need use airline vouchers see turns cost eat. Herd immunity come. die? went Giants game April wanted vax proof. showed picture card phone, showed driver's license could compare name. Low vaccination numbers. Unc vaccine optional. several friends vaccinated, ideal. heat good. direct sunlight.

unfortunately, tropical areas tend humid, people prefer comfy indoor a/c . that, tropical areas quite cloudy wet season (june-sept) make difference. days ago interview brainless idiot lost parents still concerned effects vaccine going get regret parents getting it. think anything change people's minds? I'm similar group people legit tried say ""it's mask mandates""... dropped (?????) days later.

Uh, no. Florida hotspot plague right now. Nothing say makes hiring idiots care vulnerable okay. shortage pops needs dealt way **doesn't involve fucking staff fucking nursing home constantly introducing deadly virus elderly**. can't comprehend idea.  October well, neither 1st 2nd shot resulted symptoms beyond sore arm me. vaccinated people US intentionally misunderstanding. I'm vaccinated, I'm fine, actively take precautions stick anyone vaccinated. Well, includes children (babies), people illnesses extremely elderly people. mom cancer I'm kind disgusted people acting like duty everyone else go ahead die. would love know many people got vaccinated work unfortunately that's one question can't answer. I'm defending them, saying I've ran issue before. Obviously canceled trip instead breaking law. Yeah lived like hour Philly life (Allentown) stars bars flags like 5 minutes house hahaha, middle state bonkers. looked mirror saw cringe. That's first step towards changing life. agree upper respiratory vaccines hopeful. think that's real hope maintainable sterilizing immunity. going spray nose every 3 months? Maybe that's something person overly concerned covid use feel better, see 80% population frequently enough work. 87.3% actually UK. problem stuff falls category ‚Äúprobably nothing, remote chance something small,‚Äù

 believe type thing hurt messaging day 1. turn us mess half country believing told. article confusing whole population adult population. didn‚Äôt move that, that‚Äôs everyone made be. I‚Äôm PA FWIW think we've phenomenon UK kids vaccinated either.  said past booster likely necessary (David Parkman interview comes mind), although yes hesitant necessary provide time. main argument however focusing countries yet first doses giving boosters fully vaccinated wealthy countries, agree with.  read getting shot. Maybe it'll double chances. fact checking first replying everyone thread misinformation   West shit this, unfortunate also fire. would really like move enjoy cooked alive. mean well ventilated space, virus stays air flow possible, way kill virus air spraying around, like solid surfaces? spray use?

Good ventilation effective trying spray air likelihood disinfectant drop spray attaching virus particle air pretty unlikely unless one fog disinfectant machines professionals use.

I also hear UV-C disinfecting lamps work well, use nobody room harmful skin eyes. three numbers way high. Close order magnitude each. clear whether increase RSV infections simply case lot unseasonable infections number would occurred, last winter instead right children getting seriously ill would otherwise delay exposure. former case, matter timing serious illnesses changing, I'm super concerned beyond children's hospitals prepared influx. latter possibility much concerning. Happy hear. relatives friends there, hit COVID (unvaxxed ones tough time. One hospitalized). visiting earlier summer masks pretty much non-existent (same VA, though quite hit surge yet, per VA dept. health). sad. parent, children dying scare shit need understand actions impact others.

Maybe decades condition bootstrap society. US tfg comes something others we're mememe individualism way.  got moderna, need moderna booster?

Or go pharmacy get ever booster? Right! posted yesterday here. news I‚Äôm hearing RSV whole heck lot, case previous years. watched roundtable DeSantis half dozen heads largest health care groups across Florida. salient message repeated +/-95% COVID hospital admissions unvaccinated patients. 

What big takeaway DeSantis felt tweet public? monoclonal antibodies promising treatment COVID. 

DeSantis terrible human being. know efficacy drop among ages? can't imagine age groups. Honestly think pearl clutching kind pathetic weird, they‚Äôre kids like even get sick they‚Äôre largely gonna fine, ideally good amount vaccine doubly so. schools opened either. rising cases kids hospitalized US, makes concerned many cannot vaccinated yet. 

Thank you. side screen. nurse kind.

Also #$#%@ Apple blocking FaceTime account someone phishing number. Lost precious time there. live California. asking done there. appears state link sent me. That's asking. guess asking questions makes jerk nowadays..... Presumably people vaccinated get infected super immune sterilizing immunity can't get there's data that. super excited read industry newsletter. staffing definitely see issue. don‚Äôt think anyone fully understands much people jump around different sectors hard it‚Äôs find staff anywhere (most likely sector end people predicted newsletter). 

The solution opinion apply CMS dollars. would happy blanketed this. It‚Äôs depressing answering ‚Äúshow law‚Äù questions, receiving many religious declination forms, yesterday one exposed COVID positive patient. I‚Äôm utterly exhausted government support welcomed. around one 1200 Floridians currently Hospital COVID.... oooh tight üò© vaccinated infected. antibody test can't show difference. Vaccinated effective infected test can't tell. yes, point feed saying things like ""they shut again, people wouldnt allow it"" ""even reinstated mask mandates one actually going wear them"". justifying message validating saying sooooo many people feel way could never it. know requiring masks get vast majority people wear masks. see videos one people kicked places. places mask mandates followed places didnt enforce peer pressure people wearing resulted people wearing them.  unvaccinated risk. nobody room covid, nobody get infected. somebody does, vaccinated degree protection unvaccinated doin't regardless whether person covid vaccinated not.   no, literally opposite ""We predicting early next year go away,"" Michael said.

Add pile predictions.  haven‚Äôt gone full misanthrope, covid completely destroyed hope humanity would come together needed done climate change. idiots social media arguing it‚Äôs hoax even Florida water. I'm charge minimum $100 per test. None free shit anymore. feel like anti maskers insecure extremely scared going back normal like mask mandate somehow give illusion everything fine  people view numbers ever want perception Delta variant landed saw cases gradually rise Euros started cases started sky rocketing (here saying wait 2 weeks see impact numbers fyi) euros ended cases started plummeting, restrictions lifted plummet people used numbers say working well 2 weeks later see numbers gradually rising again. domestic football started last week full crowds expecting cases sky rocket weeks time see.

That said hospital cases deaths quite low comparison seems poorly looked long covid general side effects covid hard tell much worried.

Someone set great website collate data around March/April last still since day got fully vaccinated. getting booster 2 months recently recommended - moved life.

I still hang sub drama though.  problems words, know, reading understanding them.

""this could have"", ""some them"", ""about half""

That's scientific study, data, stats. lot ""could""s ""may""s.

No, asymptomatic infection high rate long term complications. Considering maybe 3x people got bug symptoms compared tested positive, maybe hundred millions got exposed without developing symptoms. study data shows high rate long term complications among them. one thing, still early know anything long term point, worth anxiety people,of course, without symptoms, think many are,are going exceedingly well. prince waiting ""offered"" him. let offer silver platter. CA site it: still don‚Äôt understand aren‚Äôt asking businesses put UV lights air ducts, especially high density indoor areas, restaurants people can‚Äôt wear masks. UV lights expensive, kill virus. Hospitals it. seems like everything show, visually reassure people it‚Äôs safe, like obsessive cleaning, plastic barriers, masks rely every individual person wear double layer properly, versus something would actually help proven work. already got good answers, think so, couple weeks think. Worth noting drop began _before_ schools finished summer though. know lot people hate still think serves purpose. Change management burn house down.  feel like lots stems fact people anxious last year, cases rising US (where everything seems extremely polarised), anxious people way overrepresented subreddits. 

Most fully vaccinated people enjoying lives UK probably spending time subreddits like lol. least, I'm pretty sure none friends are. sure point - think family NZ border situation concerns still. submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh, thank setting straight! :) But, unfortunately, last sentence omitted :(  Federal government decent amount authority, power replace elected officials. Sounds like question doctor.  assume mean Tucker Carlson vaccinated. mutate fast like flu though vaccines effective. keep reminding brain incredibly plastic  live barely anyone wears outside public. shops/supermarkets etc it‚Äôs 50/50 going every weeks. Pssst‚Ä¶I know score good stuff free. First, go local pharmacy whisper, ‚Äúyou got stuff vial stops covid?‚Äù take back room hook. you. UP. think us know talking heads believe say, playing role get viewership money. probably make fun behind backs. children quotes? I'm curious, kids back school now? exactly!  need herd immunity, unfortunately means people children get sick since morons won‚Äôt vaccinate, that‚Äôs punishment disrespecting science. people comparing racism something else. Covid made despise humanity much fully stopped caring global warming. planet much better without us. whole we're beyond pathetic. Yeah, UK peaked around 315k cases week weeks ago. STILL putting around 200k cases week. drop nearly hard expected instead plateaued relatively high case rate. Source: I've curious found data. asked question mods removed it. teacher, appreciate much. glad live state government taking proper steps keep children safe possible. production facilities needed both. Florida big spike last summer people hide inside AC. People actually spend time outside winter there. No. Thanks butty, feel proper shit. don‚Äôt think much regarding controlling spread, another lockdown‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs powers decide whether that‚Äôs going option not. I‚Äôm 50/50 whether happen again. Yeah think see ramp major festivals still going ahead end. festivals 60000+ capacity access proper shower clean 3 - 4 days unless spent 50quid ticket‚Ä¶ Us festival goers drunk, dirty stupid lol High vaccination rates mean high antibodies. Pretty sure city requires show proof vaccine events like saying 86 55 numbers relate preventing infection? since qualified all... Uh - would mind tell HOW, please? visit US UK year?

I live US family waiting visit UK. far know, travel still banned people coming UK US. Please let know - I'd really appreciate it!  moments. Austonia??? situation good enough full stadiums years English Premier League games! love (Im US) games soooo much better fans haha! Source? never 100% vaccination false narrative. always portion population either unwilling unable get vaccine. can't say well 111 deaths x% must vaccinated folks vaccination rate y%. 111 people less 0.0002% UK's population. 99.99% vaccination rate still deaths unvaccinated folk. Wow. That‚Äôs good. remember Brazil getting shredded. Nice hear Kinda sounds like meningitis. think reality we're going get variant bypasses vaccines Delta supposed extremely contagious, read somewhere almost unvaccinated expected get point. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre wearing mask walk someone get it‚Äù kind infectious. Ok thanks Ugh, disappointing. pregnant work home don‚Äôt venture outside bubble much. Sounds like maybe shouldn‚Äôt given experience. sounds good knowing people refuse vaccines, giving another excuse get test could hurt us get tested infect people.    coronaviruses. Get high horse please. Children die every day, it‚Äôs tragic heartbreaking it‚Äôs true. act like people using ‚Äúacceptable amount deaths‚Äù thought process comes Covid. reality done since Dawn time. Children die car wrecks, crossing street, playing outside, flu, choking, ect. Yet still let children live lives without constant fear accept can‚Äôt protect everything time. fucked it‚Äôs fact life can‚Äôt save everyone. (Though wish could)

Let‚Äôs say entire population vaccinated US, still statistically likely child would die Covid. It‚Äôs fucked it‚Äôs true. Get high horse think rationally one moment.

What need cautious, wear masks get many people possible vaccinated available all. don‚Äôt like needles either. Easy though look away I‚Äôve done shots works. didn‚Äôt even feel first shot second. they're sharing same... Cam ingerland, get Sam fackin antibodys Californians want stricter mandates less. Especially become vaccinated, really care things, anything tend support risk breakthrough infections. lockdowns useless unless another endgame. don‚Äôt understand people praise countries. Lockdowns mitigation effort long term. put time money vaccines.  Right? guy *sounds* good I'm hard time believing considering studies coming out. Like Delta came India  hospitals overwhelmed vast majority unvaccinated people. get sick vaccinated, yes. even potentially end hospital. everyone vaccinated (who able), would absolutely seeing massive numbers hospitalizations now.

I one want serve unvaccinated people restaurant, want food takeaway, I‚Äôm 100% board NY‚Äôs rules. virus‚Ä¶ make rounds. Large airports rapid result tests *are* valid entry Hawaii. addition rapid tests like Walgreens ID test also accepted Hawaii. 

If want travel somewhere research it. info hard find. went Hawaii back, accepted vaccination cards everyone testing going.

Yes willing fork extra quicker turnaround too, that's part cost trip. love people wary vaccines ""don't know what's it"" rando Facebook says ingest random drug gleefully dive right in. Confirmed cases actual cases haven‚Äôt personally seen data suggest efficacy time debatable yet, agree unvaccinated need take priority ‚Äúboosters.‚Äù data comes along make us rethink that, think open changing course. like many others, want us go data leads us. It‚Äôs possible they‚Äôve already peaked: many places US even need show actual vaccination card, photo copy do. Even easier fake real one.  
It's theater roll national ID-type card instantly checked online database. protection serious illness wanes significant numbers people 8 months

I still seen data supports    Today: 1.02 Million total shots, 562,000 first shots!

Stats: First time seven weeks day one million total shots.

As yesterday, 60% total population gotten one shot.

There 31% increase people getting fully vaccinated comparison last week. People willing take job is. needs change system, movements decades change it, avail. people taken care nursing homes getting screwed over, yes, can't expect someone work job demeaning minimum wage. problem even helping people shower, wiping asses, management pay. issue unvaccinated Delta variant spreading fast, far infectious. people vaccinated nursing homes, risking deaths hospitalizations residents there. vulnerable population, even residents vaccinated, they're still put risk death given poor health already.

For set getting vaccinated they'll lose job it, better health residents they're gone. understaffed ultimately less dangerous increased risk spreading Delta variant residents. 94% enough? assume realized comment started ‚Äúmany Americans,‚Äú set parameters. Good try pedantry moving goalposts though.  I'm trying reconcile information 94% antibodies, number cases still high.

So... catching without antibodies? low levels antibodies? compromised immune systems? What's current ""fuel"" pandemic? vaccines I'm aware provide partial protection enough past wipe certain diseases like smallpox. proven false? protection wanes time? 

You may want check sources, believe categorically proven, authorities many countries developing guidelines booster campaigns. crazies reusing crazy stuff US, thankfully, seem far fewer here. ""Ok, Uncle Frank, right. excessive drinking matter all."" Christianity Judaism Islam, pork forbidden public safety hazard. Case closed.  treated like passport fraud serious basic, first offense passport fraud 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1542, lying passport application, fined $250,000 sentenced ten years prison.

It pretty much passport fraud used allowed travel True, meant moreso actually someone physically find attack him. sleep easy able walk public without shitting bricks shoes, that's me.  Already happening small town southern Illinois. This. first comment sounds racist. tell comments mean racist lol. comments jolly.  What's crazy it? People choose take vaccine, school mandated Haha, right?

Now masks protecting 2 things (I realize more... 2 abnormal things) ... even benefit effort. there‚Äôs lesson mean, wouldn‚Äôt still possible, vaccines? Masks social distancing work enclosed building live, shit eat. seriously far base pathetic point. Whatever commentary hard problem fix changes nothing, send unvaccinated morons nursing home, charged accessory murder. love 5km limit imposed lockdown! idea many people die time. autoimmune diseases problem, meaning undiagnosed people gonna fine. Immunosuppressants often taken treat autoimmune diseases problem. 3rd shot nothing productive outside haven‚Äôt healthy/normal response tell - even boosted immune response healthy people, it‚Äôd likely result experiencing mild symptoms cases unlikely transmissible. Immune compromised elderly MAY benefit need data. Healthy people shouldn‚Äôt jump line need vaccinations might benefit vulnerable group. comment highlighting better continue mass vaccination greater effect giving healthy population third jab. one meds guys like Dennis Prager advocated for. conservatives reading this, guys like Prager give damn literally care less died tomorrow. think places case.  easy find bed, way harder find qualified staff run it, especially ICU.

There already nursing shortage

Then add burnout--not long hours death hostility unwillingness cooperate.

This inevitable. it‚Äôs ethical force needle someone. I've got bad news you, son. First graders aren‚Äôt major risk COVID, I‚Äôm particularly concerned group either. watch parents die covid mind change nothing  Yeah see would great except think that's true stage. I'm also approaching 8 months (trial).

A flu sequelae could handle. know I'm already low risk hospitalization death. Moderate ""mild"" disease brain fog loss function scares me. amazing considering high-risk groups like 95+ % vaccinated  Yeah, we're lot drama workplace right now. We're several professional adults, vaccinated, except one single holdout, none us want go back observing recently re-implemented statewide mask mandate (and one person). one person, days office go ridiculous performance putting mask every time emerge individual offices. 

The kicker even great job masking herself, wears ill-fitting cloth mask. concerned, one would think would showing N-95 perhaps even double masking, no. strongly suspect insistence follow mandate Karen-esque inability deal anyone anything they're ""supposed"" real concern transmission office. Nov. schoolbus driver pay actually dollars different WA/ID, least near border. Idaho got bunch WA drivers WA mandated masks drivers come back. rumblings husband's work, honoring religious exemptions lot people got religious overnight. clue regarding teacher pay. infected, vaccinated? wife fall group.

It worst Christmas ever. \*very\* good body's defenses already prepared! smell ever come back? going verify info? I‚Äôm sure bunch using fake vax cards. immune system completely off, die, unless live 100% sterile plastic bubble.

Luckily cases rare, immunosuppressants try anyway (they need tell system chill bit transplant rejected). Usually may coax reaction system poke long enough. One strategy I've heard try different vaccines one produces antibodies. I'm CI double agent. 60/40 split. Sadly aligned politics, course.   governor ""recommended"" masks, passed mandate (all sane friends wish would.). governors damn thing actively fighting methods curb transmission. one disagrees think seem think immunocompromised people benefit much immunocompromised? two say immunocompromised people need want cdc blatantly attempts social engineering undermines credibility reliable source there's shortage vaccines that's unvaccinated gotten think care people get sick country many people live paycheck paycheck sick pay. 

Sounds like boosters page  totally blind actual struggles people six figure jobs benefit. Reference range depends specific test ran, likely that‚Äôs positive result. negatives going &lt;0.8 &lt;0.4U/mL. not, circle does. Maybe central Dallas better masks, distancing, etc, here. fact, weeks school started, friends stories cases kids classrooms. children daycare.

Personally vaxed, wear mask populated stores, majority here. Heck, even local gym signs must wear mask, people walk one, scan barcode immediately take off.  said something else?

That second shot caused inconvenience since feel par daily routine and/or tasks. really put damper work performance along social life week. Oh, mean **other** Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio, Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps, Rubella? states ""England's population"", ""the adult population England"". huge difference. 61% UK's population fully vaccinated, means 39% not. people see cases still high figures UK, read 80.7% England's population fully vaccinated, paints false picture simply untrue. next one doesn‚Äôt Covid‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm referring to.  Sorry, still don‚Äôt get it. Feeling stupider minute ha Natural Immunity sufficient supplement vaccinations. many susceptible hosts, subsequent wave infections reaches many them. could take years get going route, time probably even halfway there, immunity would begin wane.

Mass vaccination way this, period. need ton people get vaccinated need now. What's cost treatment someone insurance whose insurance cover this? you‚Äôre afraid shots, get it. Let‚Äôs gooo. Wonder many university job mandates Noted lol I'm finding difficult sympathetic well.  think making data? true. However, It‚Äôs unlikely mutate deadly become dominant strain. probably happen localized. Well, thanks random Redditor, I'm convinced! Bring it!  Hi! Thank much everything especially now. ordered pediatric one. Could please kind share normal levels look for. children 9. issue r/childfree moment. even though probably wealthy suburbs Dallas, circle friends know others who've hospitalized covid? even passed? mainly affecting minority communities rural towns? even read last paragraph? think episode Garth ""Old French Whore"" too, funniest thing ever seen. +1 DDG. Best search engine sure except edge cases. Ah. sneaky edit part. Maybe edit comment clarify? ""data"" WSJ article provide data. definitely depends are! toddler live northern dallas suburb, constantly see people masks stores. staff son's daycare wear masks (and whole time), 85% coworkers wear well. largest districts WA already 90%+ vaccinated, push needed get balance done. 80 deaths actually going additional though. may ""harvesting"" effect people die Covid instead something else (i.e. average 80 year old dying Covid quite high chance dying generally), or, noted, people counted dying Covid died things. Lmfao stepping post armchair GM Charlotte Hornets would like issue apology Michael Jordan, Terry Rozier, Big Handsome, Purple Shirt Guy, city Charlotte lack foresight regarding Terry‚Äôs contract. 

To fair though, Kemba *did* drop 60 months signing. matter go speaking circuit, telling people believe in. make way way. get infected SARs  much realistic snapshot country did, admit optimistic society pulling together. way get enough people cursory protection. happen vaccination combination vaccination natural immunity. latter route arduous seeing. think it‚Äôs starting peak, least IL. Cases still going up, much smaller rate been. need new vaccine. current ones highly effective delta, especially booster. example, moderna‚Äôs original formula given half dose raises antibody titers delta 42-fold. ‚Äúproblem‚Äù seeing (expected surprising) waning antibodies people vaccinated early (who also happen higher risk likely lesser antibody responses general) coming highly transmissible delta. Delta minimal immune evasion. simply need delta-specific vaccine. see variant-specific vaccines, likely something significant immune evasion (such beta gamma, likely something haven‚Äôt even heard yet). relatively easily (which doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúeasy‚Äù) develop variant-specific vaccines, mean SHOULD. benefit case simply nowhere near cost. watched appearance msnbc today said exact opposite. Protection mild infection waning protection serious illness still high. Please stop spreading misinformation. antibodies mean immune, amount antibodies vary. we've seen vaccinated people still carry virus, people still regularly testing work go event could still positive. 
 
Around 70% adult population fully vaccinated, large proportion Covid already antibodies. 
 
You've also got Delta variant antibodies previous infection provide much protection vaccines. US stable enough politically mandate things like that. Also schools federal thing, think. People need stop downplaying effect covid kids. Mask up, get vaccinated, stop in-person schooling. know several taken vaccine last two weeks taking point.   He's Garth Brooks, like 50% country fully vaxxed. conservative town full old people 70% vaxxed. lot distortion anti-vaxxers extremely vocal. doubt someone popular Garth would struggle, truth even vaxxed masked effective crowd 35,000 people. There‚Äôs connection wildfire smoke covid. smoke weakens immune function lungs makes vulnerable virus. one thing US really right, religious right one group religious person rights other. matter member small sect Catholic.

When extraordinary situations, extra careful throw away good things. [So saying I'm sounds like absolute nightmare deal with. well long term solution increase hospital staff 30 50%! course requires years training investment, Western countries forward-thinking they'd realize never go back patient levels seeing 2019. Covid become endemic, least next 2 7 years expect waves critically ill flooding system. 100% believe someone said ""f mask"" ""deny service throughout entire shopping experience"" children?  active severe cases among unvaccinated green among fully vaccinated dies within certain period positive Covid test Covid death even might died things.

Comorbidity man, that's ALWAYS worked. one Actually dies HIV, usually die something else destroys white blood cells. 

Covid making immune system shot. people die complications like Pneumonia something else. 12  Don‚Äôt speak soon hope make sort breakthrough this. effective easily modified flu vaccine would amazing. get hopes ""there flu anymore"" I'm hopeful ""we something better now."" moved away WA quickly learned add ‚Äústate‚Äù whenever people asked from. didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd asked tons questions DC. sure getting here? I'm simply stating opinion UK reached point virus longer, unlikely return to, crisis.

I've commented took get here, opinion inevitable end point everyone eventually. Gonna need new boosters tailored delta children. accomplished making top 3 '24 GOP presidential primary matter consequences end being. looks like masks getting pretty heated start becoming physical

in store require, ask, offered thank people wearing mask shop.

Let‚Äôs say someone scream ‚Äú f mask take chances‚Äù. it‚Äôs time register literally step ask ‚Äò happened mask?‚Äô get met with
- ‚Äújust refuse wear mask doesnt give right deny service throughout entire shopping experience everyone treated monster avoiding ignoring isn‚Äôt right.‚Äù
I ask difference shopping without mask.
- answer ‚Äú cant see anyone smiling dont feel like treated respect‚Äù

alot mask complaints one sided. masks aren‚Äôt forever, long want goes show plainly: way still getting everyone vaccinated. 8 months original comment said replied - alleging vaccine fades then. agree improves efficacy much improvement debate worth versus prioritizing efforts. That‚Äôs whole point comment. yea, page here. 100k cases USA per day recently. January 200k cases. sure data graph using millions cases 2021. get wrong, numbers everywhere show overwhemingly vaccinated significantly protected idea actual numbers graph coming saying 2021 numbers USA. was, past tense, worth risk, Delta. full/filling pediatric hospitals around country seems indicate change coming AAP, CDC, others soon. sure that. Look Florida vs California last year experienced eaves time. Look UK‚Äôs Delta wave. It‚Äôs really hard see impact mitigating factors make. negative. inverted. Pay attention numbers right side... Google made advertising online cost effective targeted. idea 'web' 'something else' nonsense. web browsers, news aggregators, email accounts Internet forums. Google excelled making things better competitors. I‚Äôm smaller town Alaska. Pretty high vaccination rate. remember last fall, huge peak cases, would get around 15 cases day. Now, we‚Äôre averaging 40 cases day. It‚Äôs shocking. know reason CDC changed it‚Äôs guidance require vaccinated people wear masks indoors? reason doubly vaccinated people get breakthrough infections infect people. Vaccinated people likely get infected around unvaccinated, even vaccinated people spread other. Hell yes, member scientific community, booster shot idea definitely ""proven false"". Every vaccine expert ask tell third vaccine shot would improve efficacy, basically vaccine. immune system ""learns"" fend virus seeing spike protein recognizing invader, every shot get vaccine another learning opportunity. That's second shot increases efficacy.

The debate whether ""worth it"" get third, fourth, nineteenth shot. second shot Pfizer 88% effective preventing symptoms, third shot brings number to, say 92%, get third shot? brings 98%, get third shot? 98%, even study fourth shot?

It's also false dichotomy giving people third shot getting unvaccinated people first shot. US example loads extra vaccine rotting freezers unvaccinated want it. given anyone wants it, run out, make more. agree certainly going better give first two shots unvaccinated, sticky bit right getting consent it. Even data shows third shot miraculously 100% effective. Getting 0% 88% effective much important getting 88% effective 100% effective. work denominations lay preachers, fixed leader? would respect sincerity personal belief small group met every sunday one members homes read bible would somebody attended megachurch. often referenced far ahead countries vaccination efforts. Canada watching impacts waited shipments. Canada ahead Israel relevant. *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going disappear. One day, it‚Äôs like miracle, disappear.‚Äù*

But that's assuming they'd brainpower come first place, probably giving much credit. Thanks explanation. look New York Times ""Hot Spots"" map every day, Nebraska empty hole white sea orange red. figured due underreporting. usually figure Israel charts one can‚Äôt interpret. almost negative? One vaccine infection (with Covid) appears provide super immunity research indicates super immunity might last years. people still immune system niave COVID last winter, that's case anymore disagree you. think exceptional circumstance.

But certainly see point. ron deathsanta normalizing death? say aint Wow site popup city. Hmm, work well college - most, would first personal health choice, probably first vaccine parents accept decline them. actually read data? believe stating things factual? dense. tweet literally DISAGREES cites DATA (of recent Lalapalooza) even tweet wrong. Stop hiding behind article thinking absolves spreading misinformation. 

Want examples? go! Enjoy. plenty factual people read data follow this. You‚Äôre misinterpreting argument article you‚Äôve consumed. need boosters 8 months.

I'm fully vaccinated problem wearing mask private property places public accommodation may necessary.
 
However, first principles Constitution cast aside, even face pandemic. virus keeps mutating like has‚Ä¶ new one comes contagious buts let‚Äôs say 100x deadly‚Ä¶ happen, matter time figures looking like 25% reduction Phizer September Priorities. hospital admissions got top priority.

Get vaccinated. Plain simple. free. I'm convinced cases rising big deal level antibodies vaccination level really high tbh. honestly, is, do? 

We've vaccinated almost every adult wants it, we're moving onto 16 &amp; 17 year olds JCVI seem reservations going much lower that. certainly hope make extra provisions available NHS able cope winter surges degree, think much appetite potential restrictions drag much point vaccination widespread.

You're right fact people still moderating behaviour, year spent largely form restrictions never going revert pre-pandemic levels night. Many people realised work home, hybrid, hopefully get continue so. Normal behaviours continue creep back time. Partially yes. also lot nurses leaving profession altogether. Nurses quitting hospital like crazy. Many nurse friends quit nursing jobs decided pursue professions now. nurse SUCKS right now. OK. Yes, school started spreading kids like wildfire. hospitals full.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, said likely normal post viral illness present, nothing that's new disease particular virus. read post thoroughly. 
I understand condition hope get help. drug trial ongoing starting soon targeting cell receptor might implicated recall paper read many moons ago. I‚Äôm sure cruise line pretty low occupancy.  wearing work basically 8 hours day. container full throat lozenges desk. Usually go 2-3 lozenges day work, keep bag near main sitting area home. dream, sadly probably never happen. So, ah, seat belts optional Texas ? never understand anti maskers anti vacciners drive road seat belts on!?!?!? semantically strict sense. something miraculously disappear, would expect wake one day *Poof!* gone. Best case scenario, might slowly fizzle time, I'd hard-pressed call disappear like miracle. virus may well endemic, case best case miraculously disappear asteroid strike incinerate human race. Lies. see downvoted. Ignoring capability children spread COVID (Don't forget children tend little petri dishes anyyway) means ignoring perhaps major vector spread. Many places travel/agency staff. staff nurse chugging along whole time get absolutely nothing extra. Yeah appreciate it, time ended masks vaccinated one people still wearing stores..

Just asking ever get assholes harassing wearing mask? least week dickhead makes comment says bullshit wearing one. Can‚Äôt believe people get offended wearing mask. really wish people could trespassed...  Agreed long term. Agreed done early still working towards that. 19 months.... maybe first cases outside china reported? 8 months ago first EUA go effect, although start mass production vaccines approval. 

I'm sure lead times supply chain like this. going 100+ raw materials, trained professionals supply chains, etc could easily lag time couple years. done cursory searches topic, find useful info, maybe others expertise could chime in. think 2022 expected production supposed several billion doses, huge increase 2021 production, maybe measures already works. 

Either way, something changed couple months. question doses October. 

That said, get booster, am. up.to determine doses going. I'm perfectly fine people getting first dose prioritized, least allowed use dose would otherwise expire. People think it‚Äôs fake. letting virus kill everyone accepting society?

The band teacher wife could gotten vaccinated low risk dying covid. I'm compaining misrepresented headline, data Hopefully number people Covid doubbled.

I'd say likely true. like vaccines shit big pharma time. mutually exclusive? went clinical trials approved FDA. People shit big pharma price gouging, fueling opioid crisis, etc. seem able find **news** story anywhere Fox News 10th shot may need 11th feel staff probably forced expose themselves. talk mRNA vaccine able tweaked order battle variants? so, one available Delta? can't keep ignoring misinformation fighting it. We've tried ... work. 

However, realize saying got taken account. think argue smell issue debilitating long covid. Yes, there's issue smell people, wife it, that's far cry things claimed new disease called long covid now. We'll need research mentioned previous post tease put bed one way another. Must higher however northern states, unlike southern states low vaccination rates allowed disease reach levels causing breakdown healthcare. dont give antivaxers ideas  Yep, media training, PR 101, interview prep, statement formation, etc Hm. autoimmune take immunosuppressants. wonder impact. good parent. hospital alone (Illinois) 12 ICU 30 med/surg beds blocked enough nurses cover patients. Meanwhile, ER 40 patients waiting beds. Sure get buried (and really mind!)...

UK resident here, currently end experience Covid - fact, isolation ends tomorrow! caught Covid two weeks ago. sure where, suspect sports event son large, indoor venue pretty sparsely populated, guess quality quantity counts!

I've sick pig ten days, half spent pissing moaning home, simply asleep sofa. dangerous symptoms, anything I'd entertain bothering NHS - felt like shitty bout flu. Fortunately, second vaccine (Ox/AZ) back June, I'm certain prevent catching (obvs!) certainly made symptoms manageable non-life threatening. wife it, one kids, well recovering timing could better (fucking summer holidays!) outcomes been.

There's great ending story. We're recovering, completing isolations looking forward getting back normal again. could happened 12 months ago vaccines available and, so, outcomes may much serious. grateful this.

Please people - get vaccines. yourself, deal aftermath. So, ah, seat belts optional Florida? understand mask vaccine refusal, wear belts.. Here‚Äôs weekly reminder AG [indicted 6 years felony securities fraud, somehow still attorney general.

Then, last year [every single one top aides implicated dude absolutely corrupt come. Plasma different monoclonals. Apples oranges. sure. Lots people got COVID early would likely vaccinated later. only"" 350 children died

50,000 kids died causes time period. Man sucks, I‚Äôm sorry hear that. Hope everything goes well all.  Nice! CDC fucking wait data presents such. need PR 101 classes.    They‚Äôre pushing antibody treatment now, advice says take treatments serious effects take place. lot people seeking medical help things get really serious already. maybe, maybe ends helping long run people, body gets wrecked virus affects earlier treatment antibodies could‚Äôve avoided. estimate.

You read write. Good. work towards scientific literacy, please. quality troll. laughed. probably even read bible. dumbfucks MN arguing ""personal responsibility"" good enough state fair opens couple weeks (it draws 2 million people around country every year). 

They say ""if scardy cat stay home"" ""hey, I'm vaxxed I'm going live life"" (yeah right, I've noticed ton trolls using anti-mask/anti-vax arguments claim vaxxed).  one's surprise. Well, issue, sucked whole time, regardless administration, messaging. while, limiting curve. Then, groups trying eliminate, feasible. So, people say limit curve now, think anyone sort reasoning coming angle ""we never getting rid covid"", 100% true. So, what's end game long take steps it, never really seen spelled out. So, charted different paths available estimated timelines

I say, definitely waste even current path, since still limit deaths hospitalizations greatly due vaccination.

To me, multiple paths could take, current path scenario 1 feasible:

Scenario 0: Current path, let run unvaccinated, roll dice kids schools fall early winter probably end flu like numbers deaths vaccinated. expect last big wave, endemic small number yearly deaths (comparable normal flu numbers). path expect happen mostly country. states mitigation help drag hospitalizations, prevent total number, see south seeing. would expect large final waves come holidays endemic. would anticipate maybe even something like 95% plus population sort antibody response point, vax prior infection. Lasts 6 months

Scenario 1: Mitigate kids vaccinated; everyone made decision. Probably best permanent covid wards handle influx, would Texas Florida doing, ONE thing agree with, setting antibody locations. test positive, go right getting IV drip. Vaccinated - covered either federally health care wise, unvaccinated - pocket. probably one easiest sells minimal collateral damage people want vaccination (kids) there's defined end date that's distant, would expect last 9 months 1 year.

Scenario 2: Intermittent mitigation Rt rides point measurable time Rt never rises high enough overflow hospitals. would imagine would anywhere 1 3 years. think sell 1 year let alone 3 years.

Scenario 3: Full mitigation. Similar scenario 2, even longer mitigate. even detail scenario more, never happen, expect less 10% people would want this. would 5 year 10 year scenario.   study convalescent plasma. given monoclonal antibody treatment, excellent efficacy data. 

It's already purchased federal government, vaccines have-- idea promoted someone Regeneron stock trivial part holdings make money ridiculous. anyone saying governor promoting vaccines largest donor Pfizer Moderna part portfolio? course not. 

Lots reasons criticize DeSantis it. Monoclonal antibody treatment underused needs publicity get. Texas Gov. Abbott treated prompted people learn availability. well least they'll finally peak healthcare workers able catch breath several weeks long view CNN ""news"", I'm approach. stupid deserve whatever get!! One situation, regardless details, change fact absolutely excuse vaccinated 12+.

Any parents vaccinating children children temporarily removed vaccinated. Children property parents need ensure providing basic care. Google could also suggesting people also looking base rate fallacy relation covid. Trend based search suggestions likely explanation. Oklahoma great stay around Tulsa OKC. I've noticed Seminole. Went Publix 2 days ago almost everyone wearing masks ""feels"" normal restrictions (except masks public transport), data show people still moderating behavior. Things actually back normal. That's part Freedom Day matter - people go July 19 before. Retail foot traffic still 6% pre-pandemic levels, public transport usage still 30% pre-pandemic levels, workplace foot traffic still 30%, people still spend time home used to. FT analysis day showing average people 3.1 close contacts per day, actually bit Freedom Day (when 3.7 - likely due Euro Cup, schools still open) way pre-pandemic level 10. 


The problem schools offices reopen en masse autumn people decide give shits virus transmission, cases absolutely rise - especially got colder weather less socializing outdoors. Ignorant petty voters.  happens National Guard get overloaded? someone Covid dies car crash. classified car related death death Covid?  No. exposed via vaccinated mom breakthrough infection. took two tests two days apart negative. doctor said isolate wear mask everywhere went. mom isolated room still wore masks around house. Spongebob spot making fun Texas. Look guy, joke. Unvaccinated mean.. Lower cost living, cough cough, looks Dallas prices. Might well kill point. FDA approved 3rd booster yet general populace immunocompromised. get shot soon? Parents small kids know well. [pyramid turned side. maybe there's another name type chart. also tested whether half dose Moderna works well booster. could nice option limiting amount doses used up.   Yes treat you. They're legally obligated so. also correct bill. 94% antibodies (I don‚Äôt know exactly many 1 shot), virus spread like that?

Read headline again: ""94% **Adults** England Covid-19 Antibodies"". Given high-end R0 estimate Delta ~10, still quite possible less 90% entire population antibodies, therefore actual case number charts appear show slight increase suggesting true Rt indeed slightly 1. Absolutely Right. talking triaging works killing people revenge whatever bizarre nonsense you‚Äôve gotten worked about. lady image vaccinated, feel awful her. truly sucks deserve it. 
 
If vaccinated political reasons, molecule sympathy left give. grandmother's kidneys starting fail (dialysis needed now) died nearly 2 times past 3 years family scared. Israel. anybody write useful headlines? US? book one now? thought available Sept 20th. People responsible probably avoiding non-essential shopping, everyone needs groceries. Covid - Hold beer    Slow there, talking thought scam. Sure may get J&amp;J others first immediately would gotten two. choice 3 may wait search out. mostly talking effectiveness 3 vs original covid19 we've known, J&amp;J ~70% two ~90%.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  much vaccination helps prevent severe outcomes, I'm guessing still unvaccinated. educated guess though. hospital administered treatment 65 year old fully-vaccinated uncle got bad breakthrough case oxygen getting low. eventually made full recovery (not saying 100% due treatment- obviously anecdotal). Denying medical treatment based desire revenge, ""to suffer consequences"" *exactly* said heinous party did.

There medical basis deny treatment based vaccination status. ""medical basis"", mean gold-standard studies replicated several times independent institutions clearly show killing someone save lives. way break age? percentage over-50s (or age cutoff) vaccinated? can't tell *all* employers, tell particular employer recently mandated vaccination accepts digital vaccination record, vaccination card, photo vaccination card, coming either public health authority vaccine provider. means digital vaccine passport would fine employer. suspect employers require proof vaccination would find way work turn obstacle well, although always possible unreasonable holdouts.

As far entry places like restaurants, bars, gyms, etc - think going arbitrary. bouncer bar may anything demand CDC card stick it, let pinky swear vaccinated. could always try ask manager refuse let in. Schooling done safely masking distancing. daughter went in-person either part-time full-time October 2020 - June 2021 locally acquired infections school period. Personally, like call ""Faux News."" Oh yea, real concern inevitably crowded bars Franklin St. whatever. I'd concerned Sig Ep foam party this. problem, follow mini Trump give everyone booster shot Regeneron. Unsure Peds vaccines available kids (youngest 2; want bring anything home) mom immunocompromised (2 Moderna shots zero antibodies). 

Also delta can't get hopes disappointing canceling letting go date second time. Plus think fall/winter possibility absolutely brutal.  rediculous face piece legislation, designed protect rights individuals minorities over-reaching governments others authority, used try stop state governments protecting rights individuals.

This abuse, tell abuse using public health laws push public health policy. leg stand contrive pretzle-logic interpretation civil rights law implement public health policy. jerk school board member's official page [seems despite article previously linking (seems article edited official page removed). Colorado looks plateaued. course, lowest-seasonality period year last summer, lot people wearing masks again, opened schools week (which cases started rising last year).

Predictions future plateaus largely complete guesses, historically likely better get random redditor. bunch super spreader events vegas around feb/mar - wanna say like GDC something? headline running 2 weeks    Quote:

‚ÄúIn separate interview Thursday NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúTODAY,‚Äù cited vaccines, like hepatitis B, require two primer shots, followed booster. said scientists think Covid vaccine may similarly provide long-term protection three doses.

‚ÄúWe know need boost continue follow science, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs given continuously,‚Äù Walensky said ‚ÄúTODAY.‚Äù ‚Äú




Sounds reasonable man need better PR firm help messaging something. miss going restaurants, movie theaters. got big tv, take fine. truly believe fall/winter last major waves covid. FDA almost certainly approved Pfizer's vaccine then, also see rise mandatory vaccination schools, businesses, sorts things, we've past 70 years. point people screaming studied long enough need stop. 18 months. That's long since trials started. know data people think going found 24 months, 36 months, 60 months already found billions shots given around globe. longer covid causes hospital systems brink collapse, likely mandatory vaccination becomes thing. People scream want. courts side states. watch Premier League saw they're already back full capacity crowds. required proof vaccination masks games completely open?  [nasal worked there's [some reason may effective reducing spread (albeit possibly worse reducing severe illness, would also want use existing vaccines). Damn, fuck life UT Dallas, least vaxxed still...

Vax statistics (self-reported probably full numbers)

""We're ""state agency"" University cannot implement mask vaccine mandates 
72% faculty staff least once-vaccinated 
44% students least once-vaccinated 
Recent surveys on-campus residents: 72% least once-vaccinated"" Covid-19 spreads largely unseen aerosol particles.

Looks like finally got NYT board 18 understand screens often little effect protecting people aerosol particles, helps think exhaled breath like plume cigarette smoke, Dr. Marr said. ‚ÄúOne way think plastic barriers good blocking things like spitballs ineffective things like cigarette smoke,‚Äù Dr. Marr said. ‚Äú

Not long ago ""cigarette smoke"" analogy considered crazy conspiracy theory. 12-18 year olds also getting vaccinacted Ireland currently. 12-15 year olds 64% registered vaccine within first 5 days registration opened age group. uptake seems high well. probably going kids younger 12 vaccinated though. Yep, reason places letting travel showing document. falsify illegally going country. Hawaii maybe extreme, countries certainly. true! ‚ÄúDo say, do.‚Äù - Fox News it‚Äôs misguided misinformed audience strain called (Oh Shit) varient Ugh, I'm mom kiddo that's pneumonia twice (once bacterial, viral) hospitalized flu. Delta variant putting kids hospital ICU, frustrating see people confound less risk diseases little risk Covid. studies shown older variants posed less risk kids, mean removing precautions (indoor masking, especially school settings) entire population even ability vaxxed yet. extended family vacation PCB like $4k week 3br condo beach. right perhaps also another factor *if* also something like age factor. example people certain age represented figures *before* vaccines available it‚Äôs people also likely vaccinated percentage time wise. even 70% people vaccinated 70% hospitalisations vaccinated it‚Äôs still possible vaccine worked extent vaccinated might, age, normally expected , say, 90%+ hospitalisations?  Simpon's paradox feeding much vaccine misinfo *Guinness World Records Announces World's Largest Mass Grave Children Dug* talking though people choice vaccine, though lead believe J&amp;J would sufficient? Also making assumptions person's reasons getting J&amp;J? personally got Moderna, that's one offered appointment lucky enough get back May. Long delta, told unlikely catch pass virus vaccinated. Delta changed everything though. makes lucky, smarter entitled better protection someone got J&amp;J. try compassion empathy, maybe step away Reddit while? sites setup prevent people going hospital, meaning early treatment know serious infection be.  faux ""news"" Sounds important. dedicate portion government that, like branch tree.  we're clear, fact saying Delta wave kill people US wave experienced winter? correct?  Lmaoooo aww someone needs nap :( I‚Äôve spent decent amount time reading conspiracy forums listening people work refuse. aren‚Äôt denying severity COVID, don‚Äôt think vaccine works (especially booster talk) even worse, harmful. Cali mandating vaccines weekly testing medical workers I‚Äôve even someone say ‚Äòthe tests cause wounds nose increase chances getting COVID.‚Äô lot people need staff bottleneck. sure many third shots CDC reported 561,608 first doses past 24 hours. Gravedigger Abbott nothing blocking places trying slow things down. Well government would ease restrictions. postponed easing restrictions cases hospitalizations still high. Many fed it. 90% adults fully vaccinated end month, yet live events, concerts etc. allowed, nightclubs etc. pub experience also pretty limited. feeling ""this never end"". great high vaccination numbers, help cases still high government want ease restrictions. point think I'd rather live somewhere less restrictions. depressing here. Absolutely. Melatonin best stuff.

Before sleep though make sure really well hydrated. Electrolytes water both. scale, make sure weight start dropping (1 pound = 1 pint).

If doubt call doctor, doctor find local/regional/national hotline. They'll reassure it.   every man anyway. must family friends nobody else seems.  Actually no, Regeneron antibody product Trump got longer use virus variant changed, it‚Äôs second generation product now. It‚Äôs promoted it‚Äôs needed massive increase cases. that, already purchased product going waste. Texas, example, infusion centers set state closed spring reestablished two weeks ago. it‚Äôs massively promoted state social media campaign. that, places offered hard access- couldn‚Äôt given cancer patients getting IV treatment, example.  


This underused therapy people early Covid don‚Äôt see doctor- wait get short breath it‚Äôs usually late monoclonal antibody treatment. Publicizing availability critical get early treatment keep people betting sicker needing hospitalization week later. way, resolve take heart might permanent issue. Mine usually even noticed. lol

So applied Murphy's law get right answer internet!

Well played, well played!

Here break [German governmental safety Covid vaccines discussed elsewhere, may help convincing buddy:

According German report vaccine safety July seen side effects study 75 million people fully vaccinated were:

\~10% sore arm

\~8% tired and/or head aches

8-10% got fiver

4% got muscle pain joint pain, flu like symptoms, dizziness

3% got general unwellness, nausea

less 2% got rash, swollen lymph nodes, paraesthesia, tachycardia dyspnoe.

There 228 reports perimyocarditis myocarditis earlier vaccination (ie 1 328'947 0.000304%). six men (ages 90, 80, 71, 59 56) three women (ages 84, 67 64) died (i.e. 1 8'333'333).

There total 157 people died due thrombosis receiving AstraZeneca. translates 28.3% higher rate unvaccinated people (ie statistically expected around 110-115 die thrombosis time span, due background prevalence thrombosis general population). that, AZ given anyone age 60 without explicit demand. even elderly quickly phased vaccines became available. vaccines, rates thrombosis elevated. (i.e. took seriously)

There total 135 reports abnormal menstrual cycles (most returned normal one two months according different study).

There 362 reports allergic reactions.

Table 11 (page 24) gives long list diseases might triggered various vaccines background levels. two show (potentially) elevated levels: thrombozytopenie Guillain-Barr√© syndrom, AstraZeneca. No, followed comment thread told people go get damn vaccine basically resort self-medicating veterinary (or prescription) medicine wasn‚Äôt directly prescribed them. parent, well aware 12 cannot vaccinated, although really wish wasn‚Äôt case child begging like mom, dad, older sibling. must nice.. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I find things avoiding huge deal scheme things. lot places there's delta outside house inside, value quarantine highly regional. Vaccinated people quite contagious [few days symptom 

If high-covid area, important expose older people (even vaccinated) strictly quarantine. Wearing cloth n95 mask go (inside beyond house, is) greatly reduce chances spreading it.

There's really value ""staying inside"".

If unvaccinated- I've downvoted this- social cultural system failure tragic. *people hurting, afraid, likely cases dying.* indicates deep level systemic distrust, largely due extreme greed parts society: people expect others try use, destroy, exploit gain.

Actually one randos pushing drug (and I‚Äôm endorsing means) scientist actually involved mRNA vaccines (though wrongly calls ‚Äúinventor‚Äù them). fact kind credentials makes even angry, know better, yet spouts crap Tucker Carlson, etc. think duckduckgo likely trend based people care things like Internet privacy searching use Google whatever data? games back full capacity far know. I‚Äôm football fan don‚Äôt know sure. think fans either fully vaccinated tested. think sample this, theory. Right. mate crohn's high risk drug takes disease. made clear asked crohn's makes covid dangerous affect lungs anything Man, boycotts new restrictive voting laws seem like years ago. read news coverage last year describing virus makes way respiratory track, critical cases virus reaches lower respiratory.

ergo. productive immune system stops gate house. There's still fighting, expell still onto others.

*To taken salt else guess. domt want vaccine thats choice, proven help reduce danger others treated person cares others dont give shit? Choose treat seriously, dont expect taken seriously either, especially people see first hand severe virus us. think problem nature coronaviruses mutate frequently. *excess* death figures though necessarily precise ( since comparing average) rather take care question. That's point. Getting counterfeit vaccine card one thing, show vaccine status app establishment entering knows verifiable proof central database.  double side Texas Stupid.

Is still expectation virus disappear certain date?? 50% bit BS since EVERY person country everyone 12 can't even get it. happen, go dramatically.

Also, pays live liberal area. We're 85% 12 1 shot 80% fully vaccinated 12 me. Yeah, least delta know strong curbing serious illnesses death. new variant specifically ""targeting"" vaccinated people, since e.g. would mutate among groups vaccinated people, I'd imagine mutations would cause increased infection rate, necessarily harden symptoms would help virus get ahead. course guaranteed mutation would also get past vaccine efficacy curb serious illnesses death. Delta apparently serious towards younger people, seemed safer before, seem obvious reason virus mutate way either.

And yeah disclaimer, I've come based things going currently, may true all. Bitterness mostly. mean help, I‚Äôd say sense better nothing. need mask need one designed tested protect wearer. Cloth surgical masks protecting wearer sounds like wishful thinking. 6G activated!! /s makes say this. see found interesting. think best approach would two pronged. don‚Äôt seem able create effective comprehensive long term vaccines right Covid. it‚Äôs important keep trying maybe annual vaccine like flu. read two Japanese companies trying develop Tamidli/Z-pack like med regimen Covid would probably help keep severe disease bay, prevent hospitals overwhelmed decrease community spread.

Both Medicare Medicaid fund ""nursing homes"".

First, nursing homes, aka Skilled Nursing Facilities, also take short term residents less 100 days. common patients undergoing rehab, hospice, recovery surgery conditions, hospitals rarely allow stay unless need MD present 24/7. money comes private insurance Medicare. Medicare spends 4% total SNF's, 26 Billion dollars.

Second, many nursing home residents eligible Medicaid, making FEDGOV primary payer care. Medicaid spends 41 Billion dollars Skilled Nursing Facilities.

According CDC, 14,600 Skilled Nursing Facilities USA, average Nursing Home gets $1.7M Medicare almost $3M Medicaid. may Federal money involved SNF's provide rehab, memory care, etc. Higher end SNF's might mostly privately insured funded residents, lower end, might dependent Federal $$$.

Considering strong vaccine hesitancy around world, fueled misinformation, consensus we'll never reach herd immunity coronavirus become endemic. likely we'll need take booster shots every year going forward indeterminate time future unvaccinated folks overwhelming minority.

Lastly, breakthrough measles infections occur. easy find. one example: 

Measles outbreaks becoming common vaccination rates declining. vaccine rate drops certain herd immunity threshold start seeing far outbreaks even among vaccinated. said covid. difference far fewer people vaccinated covid.

Far it, Israel started removing restrictions vaccination rate less 50%.

Schultz hopeful many people experiencing persistent cognitive issues COVID-19 eventually improve. Many stroke traumatic brain injury patients experience spontaneous recovery, brain heals within three six months.

But others worry cognitive issues caused COVID-19 may lead dementia. Alzheimer‚Äôs Association International Conference July, scientists presented research showing hospitalized COVID-19 patients similar blood biomarkers, neurodegeneration, inflammation Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. research yet peer-reviewed.

Heather Snyder, vice president medical scientific relations Alzheimer's Association, cautions findings don‚Äôt necessarily mean someone gets COVID-19 likely develop Alzheimer‚Äôs another type dementia. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still trying understand associations,‚Äù says.

For now, specific treatments COVID-related brain fog, memory loss, cognitive effects. Instead, doctors using cognitive therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology treat symptoms. Many studies, like NIH one, trying understand underlying mechanisms cognitive dysfunction long COVID patients hopes identifying potential treatments.

‚ÄúWe others collecting anecdotal data patients helped them, far definitive therapeutics,‚Äù Frontera says.

In U.S. alone, millions people developed lasting cognitive neurological problems long initial COVID-19 infection. patients may permanently disabled need long-term care. ‚ÄúMy concern we're going huge numbers population able function cognitive baseline. can't go back work, least before,‚Äù Frontera says. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt even thought long-term implications. could incredible blow economy.‚Äù

In U.K. cognition survey, portion confirmed case COVID-19 hospitalized cognitive deficits well, though severe hospitalized group. studies confirm people experienced ‚Äúmild‚Äù ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù COVID-19 lingering cognitive issues profound impact daily life.

Davis others like formed Patient-Led Research Collaborative, self-organized group long COVID-19 patients collecting data neurological lasting symptoms. peer-reviewed paper published July 15, Davis‚Äôs group found nearly 3,800 people surveyed suffered long COVID, 85 percent reported ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù ‚Äî authors define poor attention, problem-solving, executive-functioning, decision-making. small portion those‚Äî317 people‚Äîwere previously hospitalized severe COVID-19.

In one post-COVID-19 clinic Northwestern Memorial Hospital Chicago, researchers found many individuals long COVID never hospitalized yet neurologic symptoms lasting longer six weeks. 100 patients, common neurologic manifestations brain fog, numbness tingling, affected 81 percent 60 percent patients respectively, according study published March. individuals also performed worse attention working-memory cognitive tasks compared people age hadn‚Äôt gotten sick COVID-19.

**Probing brain**

Other viruses like West Nile, Zika, herpes simplex, virus causes chickenpox shingles known directly infect brain. COVID-19 patients first started reporting cognitive neurological side effects last year, scientists wondered SARS-CoV-2 might thing.

Researchers started probing brains people died COVID-19 looking traces virus. brain tissue hard come by. people donate brains research, strict protocols handling potentially infectious brain tissue make studying even difficult. result, studies small, often involving handful dozen patients.

While studies detected presence virus neurons supportive glia cells, hold neurons together like glue, scientists think it‚Äôs unlikely SARS-CoV-2 infects brain cells, least large enough quantities cause neurological damage. virus present all, it‚Äôs likely small amounts contained within brain‚Äôs blood vessels.

A Columbia University study 40 people died COVID-19 found evidence viral RNA proteins samples patient brain cells. results published April journal Brain. authors suggest previous reports virus detected brain cells may due contamination autopsy.

‚ÄúThe fact SARS-CoV-2 potentially causing cognitive effects distance makes bit unusual,‚Äù says Christopher Bartley, postdoctoral fellow immunopsychiatry University California, San Francisco, wasn‚Äôt involved Columbia study.

**Biological mechanisms**

If SARS-CoV-2 doesn‚Äôt infect brain cells, destructive cognition? two leading hypotheses.

The first infection somehow triggers inflammation brain. COVID-19 patients suffered encephalitis, swelling brain, cause confusion double vision, serious cases, speech, hearing, vision problems. left untreated, patients develop cognitive problems. Viruses like West Nile Zika cause encephalitis directly infecting brain cells, COVID-19 may lead brain inflammation less clear.

An immune response run amok, known autoimmunity, might blame instances inflammation throughout body, including brain. immune system fighting disease like COVID-19, unleashes antibodies battle infection. sometimes person‚Äôs immune system becomes hyperactive instead starts making self-attacking antibodies, known autoantibodies, contribute inflammation blood clots. autoantibodies found cerebrospinal fluid COVID-19 patients neurological symptoms.

In Columbia study, researchers found clusters microglia‚Äîspecial immune cells brain whose job clear damaged neurons‚Äîthat appeared attacking healthy neurons. phenomenon called neuronophagia. rogue microglia brain stem, regulates heartbeat, breathing, sleeping. researchers think microglia may get activated signaling molecules called inflammatory cytokines found patients severe COVID-19. molecules supposed help regulate immune system, people‚Äôs bodies release many inflammatory cytokines response viral infection.

When researchers Stanford looked brain tissue eight patients died COVID-19, also observed signs inflammation compared 14 control brains. Using technique called single-cell RNA sequencing, found hundreds genes associated inflammation activated brain cells COVID-19 patients compared controls.

They also noted molecular changes cerebral cortex, part brain involved decision-making memory suggested signaling imbalances neurons. Similar imbalances seen patients Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. results published Nature June.

A second explanation cognitive issues COVID-19 may restrict blood flow brain deprive oxygen. patients died COVID-19, researchers found evidence brain tissue damagecaused hypoxia, lack oxygen.

‚ÄúThe brain organ requires lot oxygen job,‚Äù says Billie Schultz, psychiatrist Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, specialized rehabilitating stroke traumatic brain injury patients COVID-19 hit.

Other symptoms accompany post-COVID-19 syndrome‚Äîpain, fatigue, shortness breath‚Äîcan negatively affect cognition too, Schultz says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brain issue; multi-system body issue needs addressed.‚Äù  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

by Emily Mullin

Researchers find people suffered mild infections plagued life-altering sometimes debilitating cognitive deficits.

Hannah Davis contracted COVID-19 March 2020, early days pandemic. time, New Yorker healthy, 32-year-old freelance data scientist artist. unlike many people come disease, Davis‚Äôs first sign infection wasn‚Äôt dry cough fever. first symptom couldn‚Äôt read text message friend. thought tired, fuzziness felt didn‚Äôt go away full night‚Äôs sleep.

More neurological issues followed. developed sudden severe headaches. attention span suffered. couldn‚Äôt watch TV play video games. trouble concentrating everyday tasks like cooking. She‚Äôd leave pot stove forget smelled food burning. failed look ways crossing street, narrowly missing traffic. She‚Äôd never issues COVID-19.

Davis among large portion COVID-19 patients‚Äîpossibly high 30 percent, according estimate National Institutes Health‚Äîwho suffer type neurological psychiatric symptoms. Even troubling many individuals, like Davis, cognitive issues linger weeks months initial infection.

Last year, dozens hospitals healthcare systems across country opened post-COVID clinics help patients admitted intensive care units severe COVID-19. pandemic dragged on, clinics filled people never hospitalized suffer lingering symptoms, including brain fog cognitive issues.

‚ÄúThe expectation people ICU going really long protracted recovery periods,‚Äù says Walter Koroshetz, director National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke, part National Institutes Health. ‚ÄúThe big surprise people never required hospitalization persistent trouble.‚Äù Koroshetz co-leading study NIH understand COVID-19 patients recover faster others learn biological reasons others don‚Äôt get well even months later.

A picture starting emerge COVID-19 causes cognitive issues. What‚Äôs less clear many people eventually recover many left devastating long-term effects.

A year half later, Davis work hours day lingering brain fog, short-term memory loss, cognitive issues. She‚Äôs seen dozen medical specialists diagnosed post-viral dysautonomia, nervous system disorder causes dizziness, rapid heartbeat, fast breathing rising sitting lying down. It‚Äôs sometimes treated fludrocortisone, corticosteroid, midodrine, blood pressure drug.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never experienced anything like life,‚Äù Davis says. ‚ÄúYour body feels like breaking down. lose sense self.‚Äù

**The Great British Intelligence Test**

Before pandemic began, cognitive neuroscientist Adam Hampshire colleagues Imperial College London planning large, nationwide survey called Great British Intelligence Test. goal: understand cognitive ability varies among population factors like age, alcohol consumption, occupation might affect cognition. test, anonymous takes half hour complete, involves questionnaire exercises measure planning reasoning skills, working memory, attention span.

With help BBC, team launched survey January 2020. pandemic began unfold U.K., Hampshire colleagues realized unique opportunity capture cognitive data coronavirus patients healthy people. May 2020, updated test include questions experiences COVID-19.

Out 81,000 participants took questionnaire test January December 2020, nearly 13,000 people reported COVID-19 infections varying mild severe. Among those, results revealed cognitive issues compared group suffered COVID-19.

‚ÄúOn worst extreme spectrum, people gone hospital put onto ventilator showed largest underperformance cognitively speaking,‚Äù Hampshire says.

These individuals trouble reasoning, problem solving, spatial planning test compared people age group educational backgrounds hadn‚Äôt hospitalized COVID-19. difference similar average cognitive decline seen 10 years aging. findings published Lancet July 22.

**The ICU brain**

Though Hampshire‚Äôs findings sound startling, it‚Äôs fairly common patients admitted ICU suffer lasting cognitive issues. Megan Hosey, rehabilitation psychologist Johns Hopkins Medicine, says third ICU patients acute respiratory failure symptoms similar traumatic brain injury.

One reason patients often sedated ICU reduce anxiety discomfort, caused mechanical ventilators. Sedatives slow brain activity cause delirium, sudden change mental status leads confusion disorientation. Patients trouble focusing may know are; it‚Äôs condition last hours, days, even weeks.

‚ÄúWhat know longer somebody delirious, worse cognitive picture look long-term,‚Äù Hosey says.

But sedation doesn‚Äôt explain cases neurological cognitive issues long-COVID patients, says. Many COVID-19 patients don‚Äôt need ventilators, others, like Davis, never hospitalized.

Some previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients severe neurological cognitive problems can‚Äôt participate follow-up phone screenings feel, says Jennifer Frontera, neuro-critical care specialist NYU Langone Health.

In study published July 15, Frontera colleagues screened neurological problems patients admitted hospital severe COVID-19. 382 patients, 50 percent reported impaired cognition diminished capacity carry daily activities, walk, take care six months discharged. worked prior hospitalized, 47 percent could return jobs six months later.

Some refuse cost get vaccine, clamoring much can.  Reminds story:

A fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help.

Soon man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you.""

The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me.""

So rowboat went on.

Then motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you.""

To stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So motorboat went on.

Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""

To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""

To God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter,  think needs time cover bodies. guarantee close shit again. keep going knowing shits going get worse worse. got stung waspes last show..

Currently designing tours/events work large venues, live nation, AEG many promoters going require proof vaccination within next weeks. well vendors provide tours lighting, audio, FX, video, carpentry automation gear technicians starting require vaccines going tours. 

The emails coming week writing wall big artists able perform live concert without crew fully vaccinated.

There‚Äôs overlap. lot people got vaccinated don‚Äôt want again, smaller still significant number got breakthrough case. 

But, cases also probably underreported. everyone severe enough symptoms seek medical attention, there‚Äôs time near beginning wasn‚Äôt test. 

So, it‚Äôs fuzzy number. ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù moving target depending virus mutates. it‚Äôs possible Delta last big wave US/EU. lot epidemiologists think it‚Äôll start settle something manageable relatively soon. 

Your best bet individual get vaccinated get 8 month booster it‚Äôs time. Catching vaccination big deal *most* people. efficacy pfizer dropped 75% delta, you‚Äôre wrong. areas Eastern Washington low vaccination rate. see happens schools large percentage teachers willing get fired.

Class action private university (in California) require vaccine masks person classes. make easy online classes though supportive either way. know sure, seems like most, all, teachers wearing masks, though I've seen staff (especially counselors) masked communicating students.

As someone took plenty online courses, honestly - classes require campus. I'm sorry, don't. Classes labs, yes. lectures? No. Right now, think colleges really focusing making possible many students possible take online classes. students capable learning way get others good enough internet connections, offer online learning limit campus, feel like infection rates would much, much lower student bodies would better protected. feel like biggest problem is....well. lot teacher good teachers online. skill. get it. hard point laptop white board give lecture like normal class watches zoom? 

My uncle teacher trade school, also California. teleclasses zoom (almost year, since shut down) returned campus two months ago. Basically, everyone wear masks symptoms, get tested...but still attend class waiting test results. test positive COVID, automatic withdrawal program cleared return. started class thirty, every week, two withdrawal due testing positive. far, he's lost six students.

I know answer is, feel like better adjust learn better fight virus. 

I think lot people....are done. They're exhausted lockdown feel NEED get back normal, making 'what lost due lockdown' even means risking health. Meanwhile, COVID still there, kicking stink.

At point, every man himself. Every individual needs decide willing risk live life. people NEED life return normal. want attend classes. want hang friends. want X, Y, Z. willing risk health it...than that's choice.

Schools provide medium learning....i**t's student decide want careful not.** long second last?  Let‚Äôs pump rabid raccoons full Moderna let loose. make sure everyone gets rabies shots‚Ä¶oh wait‚Ä¶ vaccinated masked kid.

Another suspicion mine we're hitting point cases going reasonably stable on, really matter.

Abstract 
Background 
Aerosol transmission COVID-19 subject ongoing policy debate. Characterizing aerosol produced people COVID-19 critical understanding role aerosols transmission. 
 
Objective 
We investigated presence virus size-fractioned aerosols six COVID-19 patients admitted mixed acuity wards April 2020. 
 
Methods 
Size-fractionated aerosol samples aerosol size distributions collected COVID-19 positive patients. Aerosol samples analyzed viral RNA, positive samples cultured Vero E6 cells. Serial RT-PCR cells indicated samples viral replication likely occurring. Viral presence also investigated western blot transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
 
Results 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected rRT-PCR samples. Three samples confidently indicated presence viral replication, collected sub-micron aerosol. Western blot indicated presence viral proteins one samples, intact virions observed TEM one sample. 
 
Significance 
Observations viral replication culture submicron aerosol samples provides additional evidence airborne transmission COVID-19 possible. results support use efficient respiratory protection healthcare public limit transmission. get first one, can't get booster there's nothing boost eh? Ahh see, thank clarifying  cost vaccines drop bucket compared US government budget. blows mind we're building new vaccine manufacturering capacity. know countries are, certainly feel like too. even worry get vaccinated, produce enough vaccine everyone be. I‚Äôm mother five year old supposed go kindergarten starting 9/7. worried sending though thankfully competent governor implemented mask mandates state wide. I‚Äôm also really sad going kindergarten experience. first time going school it‚Äôs fear. Ugh. wish people would what‚Äôs needed over. Good luck kids school year. Moderna data quarterly report showed 42 fold increase neutralizing antibodies towards delta variant. 50ug dose (currently shots available 100ug). Many people choosing boost whatever vaccine data looks best moment. asking Florida keeping numbers low...

You asking numbers correct. Hint: not.

Florida‚Äôs daily numbers get updated week two following date. Check back later see difference.  sad. Hah mistake, shouldve clarified earlier. tele, meant telemetry, work bedside acute care hospital. I‚Äôm male nurse actually. numbers growing! 

So said, would still wait 9/20 get booster? eligible since way past 8 months? Thanks help üôèüèº  Get job where? vaccine gets FDA approval expect low skilled jobs mandate vaccinations. every sick worker liability. Eventually probably able work without one. Supreme Court case *Jacobson v. Massachusetts* decided state local governments mandate vaccines citizens. Considering FDA even around time, debatable best FDA Approval legally needed government enforce liberty secured Constitution United States every person within jurisdiction import absolute right person be, times circumstances, wholly freed restraint, manifold restraints every person necessarily subject common good"" John Marshall Harlan decision Thanks announce deaths end week. Last week around 1,050 deaths 150 day. week higher. bad 13.


Also, I'm sure would presume 8th grader would 11-12. entered kindergarten 5 years old, 8 years school would put 13 years age. Headed Walgreens I‚Äôm glad reminded this. baby can't presume wrong. Also article says 13. unlikely happen, delta already two substitution domain binding receptor change epitopes recognized cells. far variant changes epitopes. may find neutralizing antibodies effective cells seem pick slack. Vaccines keep people dying using hospital resources.

There inconsistent messaging around transmission. Vaccines help this, magic.

One wear rain boots, rain jacket, use umbrella still get wet.  I'd bet everything NZ strict lockdown months they're fully vaccinated. Delta contagious contain long months I‚Äôve buying N95s projectn95.org. It‚Äôs non profit that‚Äôs covered many major news outlets legitimate, high quality PPE including N95s. got order yesterday always impressed speed shipping. Highly recommended. suprised one bit ok cognitive decline. packed overdue medical appointments trip visit family state May June, SOOO glad did. vaccines honest. fact things like mandated past absurd.  staff even bigger problems patients get COVID. Go bulls! pretty easy actually. /r/confidentlyincorrect Sorry! It‚Äôs stupid worrying. Plus mom super old, older. get worried. Yeah man agree. think ultimately cases going fade relevance testing likely decrease people stop caring vaccination. Germany already making moves direction stopping free testing soon. yeah, point seems following track still increases chance killing another person. case drunk driving, cause effect clearly seen. hit another car/person die. tend able kill 1 person car accident.

With COVID, cause effect invisible consequence much worse drunk driving. Whether patient zero somewhere middle transmission chain, pass virus dozen people pass another Florida reports deaths certificate issued, known hella long time accurate date death. makes wonder ever even burn 

that line said. point make assumption 10% rather accurate higher number pleasantly surprised burn brainer!!! Great idea.  I'm part Disney Lovers FB group people posting every day they're cancelling upcoming Disney trips due justified COVID fears. know, horrible, going overlooked people.

The thing is, there's large group people think invincible can't told otherwise .

This virus, evolving.  What's going happen get varient contagious one say %20 mortality rate? say, still %80 percent chance, probably. 

I even feel sympathy anymore.  feel bad kids getting point that's hard well.  

My state negative icu beds. people feed family needing kept ER there's else go.  

It's local news but, they've poisoned misinformation even local news ultra conservative state ""liberal biased brainwashing.""  

It gets worse keep holding super spreader events, masks required. vaccine required. 

I'm point welcome aftermath means people think way gone.  

I feel way people. Everything would much easier over. I'm sick making concessions anti-vaxers (not people medically cannot take though). Make deal inconveniences vaxed. Also, let's make everyone wants get vaxed making sure people get paided time get it.... Well I'm rich fuck realized need tour money, especially since places stopped earned million each! feel bad 1st responders. anti Vax assholes die taint karma care why? sending thoughts prayers incivilized now? drink Kool-aid? crawling Israel‚Äôs ass giving boosters? delegation rest FWCs giving boosters hating US? Get here. We‚Äôre getting boosters whether like not, we‚Äôll send 100s millions doses rest world. Stop trying punish people access vaccine.  Yes, Israel exceptionally young population, think 16 30% total pop, started vaxing 16s recently. really think there's issue postulating long covid different post viral illnesses. trouble lots stress pandemic lockdowns psychological symptoms. also know ICU patients PTSD there. 
The studies saw ago suggest curve healing following months fairly predictable even though go six months trend suggests pretty much everyone back normal then, vast majority 3 months remember. 
However, general ICU studies separate Covid19 shown cognitive issues 12 months post stay, necessarily expect everyone better traumatic time even year later. 
There may better studies actual physical damage, one saw full holes, vested interests, control way estimating pre-existing damage lifetimes participants was. 

At moment think need really sceptical probably psychological response difficult set events, rather viral damage. However, like also said, post viral illnesses think unlikely it'll different these. health care worker said first group. pharmacies aren‚Äôt going make clarify working person vs telehealth. Too*  Getting number 10 20% isn‚Äôt going anything stop spread America. Might well option third population drags us down. We've literally gathered large groups human history...wtf think it‚Äôs also omitting fact ‚Äúrich‚Äù countries, getting vaccine longer huge issue general population. US, go local grocery store instances get today. wondering UK, pandemic far almost everyone concerned. 

Yes still cases, plateauing pretty manageable level despite Delta deaths hospitalisations staying low. may think c.80 people day dying ""with Covid"" (as UK stats count anyone dies within certain period positive Covid test Covid death even might died things) UK big, put perspective nearly 1,500 people die every day UK things.

I know people Covid despite double jabbed, mostly got symptoms (and picked routine workplace testing/travel testing) equivalent cold (headache cough/sneezing nothing serious). contrast, vaccinations knew lot people who, even hospitalised, wiped week serious symptoms like loss sense smell (for weeks even months) shortness breath.

The things completely back normal travel work. International travel still giant pain due constantly changing rules onerous testing requirements making quite risky organisational even health perspective. People going offices nearly much pre-pandemic frankly think people liking working home firms embracing remote working anything fear Covid.

Nah, get better picture look [this delta, probably need least 85%+ herd immunity. Top countries barely reaching 70% fully vaccinated. Still ways go. üéµWhere masks worn,
for freedom's sakeüéµ think there's gross miscommunication here. never arguing covid would burn out, I'm suspecting 30 million cases year US consistently world many more, keep mutating never ever see cases drop go away. Instead end seeing 10% world get every year new boosters/vaccines handle latest strain past year. That's I'm afraid happen can't see logical reason path heading even vaccinated nearly everyone globally yesterday wonder Chris Gaines would do?  parent 11 yo 9 yo, getting worried return school 3 weeks. awful.

Long story short then: endemic, vaccines still work need new versions um future, virus likely turn worst version short period time even may happen need keep health restrictions death numbers acceptable.

Sounds like good time hold motorcycle rally 50000 people Hi, Houstonian here. got vaccine soon would let me. I‚Äôm person still wearing mask work. I‚Äôm still going suffer die lack hospital services something tragic happens spite efforts. Care others like me, nothing else?

That sound right.  Yeah well emergence rapid global spread novel disease nobody immunity that. likely common viruses circulate globally caused much severe waves years first emerged, largely minor nuisance now. We're lucky we've effective vaccines time around, first pandemic last. Nice tweet eight days old FWIW. trying use artificially low number wonder whether ever burn out, disingenuous. find ""right"" answer use information like CFR/IFR, asymptomatic rates group testing, etc actual data back guess that's much closer 20-30% year yes, course burn out. 

heck, even flu estimated year one says 5,000 people US die flu year 100k infected, use math inform estimates end range. range pretty big, know right answer inside range, outside.

the ""right answer"" many people catch covid year 13% might range 13-35% 20-25% something, saying 13% wrong harmful even consider option. Illinois yesterday, state school board met anti mask protest outside.

Delta slapped unvaccinated hard stressed system, there's rollback.

I think Gottlieb right saying could ""final wave"" COVID, maybe minor bubbles there. pool potential victims shrinking ever more, Delta raging fast going burn populations much faster OG COVID. Well that's end point crisis phase is, it? 

Nobody serious hoping elimination reasonable time frame, move constant crisis severe cases death manageable level given country's healthcare system. occur country-by-country, global ""victory"" day, fading top news given place.

I agree covid going around forever, mild almost every person gets it, longer society-crippling emergency was. likely fade another endemic respiratory illness caused crisis first emerged, manageable nuisance grave threat. numbers Florida weird, especially right now. Either they've hit plateau area, massive errors earlier, they've hit sort testing issue case counts. Chris Gaines, however, anti-masker pretty much normal. Long term protection related antibodies; T-cells B-cells immune system. ""trained"" exposure virus - either infection vaccines. infection fully vaccinated vaccine likely good degree ""lifetime"" protection already. exposure = better training, general.

It remains seen whether 3rd dose long term protective benefits well. pronounced study done antibodies peaking, still plausible would provide additional ""training"". Especially pointed received doses 4 weeks apart, case Israel. Honestly, shows bad COVID was, people celebrating COVID current (this moment) 3rd leading cause death UK, trending upwards, summer school even session... especially racialized

Vaccine supply sufficient.

One 2 need delayed, saying make magically happen. Lol cringey fucker coming big here. predictable while, following exact roadmap ""trojan horse"" type virus. I've NEVER seen explained media online crazy me. probably learned 3rd grade. Since prevented obvious symptoms going impossible tell covid not, already before. I've warning many people us knowing enough long covid treat like flu crazy. sides vaccinated unvaccinated treating like flu exactly covid wants. many people area saying ‚Äúwe going live it‚Äù fail think catching Covid 2-3 times year already mushy brains. wane efficacy starters

Against symptomatic disease, antibodies wane.

The efficacy severe disease, resulting hospitalization death waned. memory B cells, long lived show evidence waning.

See clear explanation medical expert. Peak surge FAR. Florida runs people infect. played stadium packed full 90,000 people Lincoln, Nebraska. family I‚Äôm sure spike, wish would‚Äôve cancelled earlier. Glad moved worst started happen. worked hospital since March losing workers like water sieve. due covid due overworked compensation thank local business giving free donuts week. I'm surprised all. Given DeSantis' actions, would surprised benefactors financial stake population getting sick enough need hospitalization acquire insurmountable medical bills. 

The whole system for-profit hospitals able donate politician makes public health rules broken wrong. pandemic, kind system set work people. I'm sorry people made suffer. bothers much system set allow betray people like that. Enough people either infected gotten vaccinated. Look UK - article came today 94% adults antibodies either vaccination infection passed Delta peak ago. Florida probably far behind, less vaccinations infections unnecessary deaths. God hope   Monica Lewinsky, there's power imbalance predatory. Like fuck lotta awful shit legal once. hope get soon! live Louisiana, happens end scale terrifying. can't even think herd immunity rival rest world active cases.

People want vaccine passports, people create fake ones they're easy duplicate. still get virus literally mutations happen. people get vaccinated going mutate get vaccines effective. remember correctly 6' guidance based data suggesting COVID readily spread droplets fall air column within 6 feet (based size needed infectious dose).

[Actually, 6 foot theory goes back several one interesting articles I've read covid-times. masks need worn post vaccination order best cut transmission let thing die vine. Otherwise

It drug point. nearly 10 hours day. Fox Disney must love much. What's actual number? Percentage increases mean anything there's number base on.

Edit: Also also says article coincides increase RSV hospitalisations, fewer patients fall 2020. I'm surprised took long. Disabled students school districts given exemptions virtual learning early pandemic recognized many disabilities need hands component learning.

So, can't go virtual, homeschooling often great option need special education teachers parents burnt normal situations times, come expensive care disabilities meaning way likely two working parents. Many private schools offer special education programs (or decent ones. Intentionally offering subpar special education way discourage applicants since schools want look special education students), public school actually becomes best option students. I'm using number statistics (all CDC).

The following example adults.

First, I'm using vaccine numbers number individuals received least one dose 72.3%.

Second, [CDC 39.9% (101.4 million adults) population infected (end May). multiply 101.4 27.7% (adults vaccinated), get 28,086,138 (adults infected vaccinated). equals \~11% adult population.

72.3% (vaccinated adults) + 11% (adults infected vaccinated) = 83.3%

I also use second calculation looks number doses administered manufacturer. calculation comes little higher (85.2%).  No. Depends health activity level, around 80 - 120 normal people.

The active lower number be. I'm cyclist resting heart rate 55-65bpm someone active could major red flag something wrong. country?

Perhaps contagiousness Delta, folks get antibodies soon (though they're taking hard way get there, obviously). GON USE YA BOOTY even infectious, probably less shorter duration time. really sliding scale. Vaccines work every front. currently offer sterilizing immunity. hope. hope. 3rd one 5 months, pharmacy new third shot. asked put reason down. Got flew shot time. It‚Äôs 80-89% *immune,* necessarily vaccinated. everyone vaccinated immune. 

They saying delta variant, herd immunity may impossible. didn‚Äôt give shit happening everyone else kid died

also interesting God's judgement kill firstborn households egyptions. jews put blood lamb doors saved deserve spared either. john baptist sees Jesus says ""behold Lamb God takes away sins world"" agree sad. However, second part comment statistically unlikely. others stated here, studies shown getting vaccine helped long haulers get hump. Me, much. has, can't tell.

Getting might helped getting worse. can't tell since more-so stagnant something seems like getting dementia. Hey man, saw comment. never got hospitalized covid I've litany symptoms I've never before. Acid reflux, muscle twitching, severe fatigue, shortness breath laying down, bloodshot eyes, blood blisters, etc. Completely healthy normal guy before. brain fine, ptsd weird stress reaction. know head lmao. Feel free DM me, wanna give benefit doubt comment completely disconnected history post viral illness. installing cheap plastic much easier actually installing proper ventilation air filtration know help. 

The plastic barriers show, create illusion business gives shit safety workers customers. chart demonstrating effectiveness vaccines Israel keeping inoculated hospital alive. Herd immunity eh? saw post Facebook today along lines ‚Äúisn‚Äôt funny need nurses yet they‚Äôre firing nurses getting vaccine.... makes think‚Äù

Obviously doesn‚Äôt make think, numbnuts. 4.6percent covid vaccinated, lots people vaccinated covid. Don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre jaded, never good person begin with.  permanent ban large in-person gatherings? Come on, dude. see 2 month old account, likely good faith argument, so, step away computer go outside bit. Children pay adults‚Äô refusal get vaccinated lost opportunities development. . . . independent school boards always listen loudest angriest people instead *majority* parents. guarantee best organized, loudest angriest anti-vaxxers anti-maskers. school board members tell community community clear: masks yelled loudest !! Interesting. would hoped better CO. (I'm southeast, though one terrible states, sounds like CO's approach state's). Yes currently trialing strain-specific boosters available public yet. 

[Here's article Moderna's booster started wearing mask again. Cases rise fall waves. 

The shape curve similar places. 

The absolute number infections higher places fewer mitigating factors. Compare Florida Canada. Last Spring, Google mobility data showed people much less mobile, generally starting week official mandates. stop arguing everything? caps edited. way help everyone get vaccinated. England far better job America.  username checks  Disney kinda sucked pandemic. 

Especially Florida. spent money influence convincing Republicans shut covid conspiracies. Everyone mask get vax they'd raking dough right now. 2500 KNOWN cases. know, could tens thousands asymptomatic extremely mild cases never even got reported. used Altavista Google came along, let tell you... hours spent going pages pages pages results find 1 2 relevant ones fun deal. think net could taken way Google raised bar *tremendously*.

But yeah, definitely impact. NY smartphone app allows pull vaccination status state database. guess going wear masks forever seeing nearly everyone antibodies they're still wearing now.  America: profit people may think number people day dying ""with Covid"" UK big, put perspective around 1,500 people die every day UK things.

100 day could still well make 3rd largest cause death, behind heart disease cancer ahead accidents. sure ""its bad literally everything else combined"" would way reassuring. Instead, 1 15 deaths caused brand new thing would absolutely terrifying depending cause (ie: sharks invaded land suddenly started causing 1 15 deaths).   4.7% england caught corona. That's much less inflammatory headline truly wonder many people getting third doses pretending they‚Äôve never vaccinated skip line. Especially light Biden‚Äôs conference yesterday.

Thank sharing! hoping things get better sooner rather later.  Well, one, Eduardo Rodriguez, pitcher Red Sox, got myocarditis COVID near beginning pandemic miss rest 2020 season. fairly common side effect COVID, clearly selectively ignoring multitude articles documented cases people getting COVID focusing extremely cases people getting vaccine. actual scientific data (as opposed ridiculously limited anectodal evidence) indicates risk myocarditis vastly greater COVID vaccine. trialing new strain-specific boosters available public yet.  Plenty people saying post -covid physical changes aren‚Äôt real.

Two different irrational stories address underlying fear insecurity. 100% extreme example demonstrate concept. people vaccinated, deaths vaccinated people, even majority deaths still unvaccinated people. **There turning point 99.99% vaccination rate still deaths unvaccinated folk.

Sure, also 10% vaccination rate deaths day vaccinated people. Would EXTREMELY unlikely? Yes, absolutely possible. Imagine 10% population vaccinated highly risk individuals; people would still appear death counts unvaccinated, healthy 20 year olds (in case COVID). ***THIS SAYING ANYONE GET VACCCINATED.*** think statistical concepts critically important understand take fuel away antivaxxers talk vaccinated people getting virus dying.

I'm seeing Walmart close Raleigh, MS. know family details lead child unvaccinated?  WHO: ""Hold boosters end September.""

That's interesting perspective, considering fact children go private school requires masks. either care childrens' ability breathe, he's willing sacrifice health children order score political points. According chart article ""Effectiveness high viral burden infections"" slightly less? come on. ~55% Pfizer four months without booster? blowing smoke done anyone favors throughout pandemic. Part husband's job requires meet people person. company requires employees vaccinated wear masks part ""pledge protect customers service providers troubled times"". nobody meets wear mask, SE Texas, hardly do. seasonal second job start long, company also requires employees serve guests way vaccinated, guests even wear masks. many businesses refusing enact enforce policies protect employees would bad business move require paying customers something minimize risk employee health safety. supposed go mid-next month.

On public transport masks either strongly encouraged outright required, depending various things, mask wearing lot higher.

Outside public though, near common. part requirement wear masks outside, even height crisis. strong recommendation wear masks busy areas, get beyond that. meant people followed pattern masks outside masks inside, public places. hate trip Miami Hawaii global pandemic killed continues kill millions people inconvenienced medical red tape designed specifically keep public fellow American state safe family try vacation kids first week school.

It *should* national mandate. safe dems so. Interesting. offered that. would good start. happen time vaccination later point? state? Assuming infrastructure already place ""upgrading internet"" matter switching plans.

If physical construction needs happen first... forget it. thought UK government health experts seems breakthrough cases fine. long resulting hospitalisations death vaccines job. 


According study, around third cases among fully vaccinated end July.  Yeah kind ironic, believe doctor started lot anti-vax stuff claiming vaccines cause autism UK hah. largely rejected quack UK though, people seem understand importance vaccines. 

Yep, Andrew Wakefield English. Antivaxx never took UK like US whatever reason. still rule followed. think hard say exactly happen, may help printed document vaccination info (dates vaccinated, time) able get NL wish Minnesota would this. imagine, says literally article. Looks like 70% profit. fine talk experience them, presenting minority rule. Also, non-profit mean pay starvation wages. That's ridiculous. Taking care elderly far important treat like something anyone do. I'd curious know management executives non-profit made well. Something tells starving.  world spits variant fuck everyone over.  


*Florida Texas‚Ä¶..* Right, that's important observation. 

My concern trying keep family safe everyone vaccinated. live part Florida almost one wear masks, vaccination rate low, even medical staff refuse wear masks get vaccinated. 

My father 85 heart condition, sees doctors regularly, told patients refuse wear masks many staff doctor offices goes also refuse wear masks get vaccinated.

My wife recovering cancer needs dental work cracked tooth I've already called several dentists told mask wearing required can't enforce since many patients fight argue right wear masks staff report vaccinated not. 

So hoping safe Delta variant breaking through; especially dentist can't wear mask. misread. Oh, bad. Actually theirs. Agreed.. like wtf? 1. science pretty clear vaccine offers less protection infected delta alpha variant. seems still offer quite bit protection hospitalization death, much still researched. 
2. Yes. still colonizes nose equal amounts. There's indication less time unvaccinated people, definititely still happen. 
3. Yes, around people, especially indoors. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt happen me‚Äù published 3 weeks ago?

I think we're talking different endpoints muddles waters. Effective - infection, mild infection, severe infection, hospitalization, death? People throw around, conflate them, use small n situation (gay bear sex week Province town) generate story want.

Overall - vaccines best tool may benefit boosters. cases kids young children? heard vaccines made stem cells aborted fetal tissue/cells. . research create used tissue/cells. . .as wont. . Catholic Mormon churches said yes vaccines, Jehova Witnesses get vaccinated. . . 

I work nonreligious antivaxers. try claim religious exemption complete bullshit.

Separate church state please. couple, live Miami Beach, arrested August 11 north shore Honolulu

They mean north shore Oahu? view case gun violence lot conservatives believe take precautions long right things living right way gun violence befall you.

They literally think thing COVID-19.

""It get me. even did, I'm tough beat it""

Their reasoning completely broken. They've watched us blow past 100k mark, 200k, ... 600k

There changing people, dug-in. variant deadly means ""the deep state trying scare us more"".

No amount evidence viral infections deaths matter them, evidence gun violence change minds literally shot. Awesome. Let‚Äôs move chaps *The problem call boosters, said, virus primarily circulating unvaccinated people ‚Äî fully vaccinated.*

I'm tired authorities spreading bad science misinformation attempt trick people right thing (in case, sharing vaccines abroad).

In county (in upstate NY), since start July, 40% new cases fully-vaccinated people. surprised reaches 50% time boosters start September. Making seem like vaccinated people zero reason take precautions helpful.

They can't ways: we're told constantly we're supposed care hospitalizations deaths. we're also told letting virus spread freely leads development variants. apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people count? 9/11 every three days nobody gives shit. One deaths father. enrages see people give shit this. Especially since I've careful since beginning pandemic. Yeah Er... What?

This usually matter paying better internet plan. Getting provider upgrade physical infrastructure place easily cost tens thousands Euros/Dollars. (Especially involves tearing road.) Seriously hope becomes norm, least California. couple vaccinated

Fuck anyone wants work elderly get vaccinated. threaten life? Kids 5 younger need even tested. kid born 2016 must 5 apparently though. 1. offer considerable protection serious outcomes, slightly less protection infections.

Anecdotally, live area modest spread, may find businesses mandating masks unevenly, ranging none ""strongly recommended"" mandatory all.

That's mostly am. Small rural county family suddenly lost child. couple possibilities. matter what, likely choice matter. What, think blood tested entire UK population?  America: What's good me, what's good us.  morally wrong deprioritize unvaccinated patients - chose massively increase risk.

Much like, let's say, alcoholics get new liver normal person saved (but black-and-white, since alcoholism physical addiction, vaccinated deliberate choice expose oneself Covid).

When saving human lives, people smart enough get vaccinated prioritized, since intentionally massively increase risk getting Covid. live San Mateo County, CA. 90%+ vaccination 12+.

Regardless, still astounding percentage population antibodies, either vaccination natural infection.

While good news hospitalizations remain low(er) (although quick Google reveals UK hospitals still great shape delay non-COVID-related procedures people), report make wonder long-term goal ""living COVID"". percentage population possessing antibodies, UK still high numbers infections hospitalizations, think least state things:

1. Herd immunity longer going functional solution;
2. unable get COVID vaccine due allergies health issues rough.....rest lives?;
3. moderately-or-severely immunocompromised, immune-system-dampening drugs, going long journey probably semi-regular booster shots possibly years;
4. virus long-term things going play complete unknown right now. waiting 'end' need re-assess strategies. world likely going many waves, unless something changes favor, variant outcompetes Delta much lower IFR milder course illness. more-deadly, less-contagious variant unlikely solve problems outcompete Delta.

Time re-calibrate, fear. mean problem sick people smaller towns get sent Dallas gets bad. even though big cities mask mandates generally treat seriously hospitals still get overrun.

Watch waspes drink water think large scale numbers. Anecdotes worthless best, misleading worst. Unless looking statistically significant sample population, worth it.

I'm saying conclusion either right wrong, I'm saying right way think it.  seen study, believe shows Figure 1 (at end) exactly looking (viral loads vaxxed vs unvaxxed): article already referencing this, paywall read it] estimates percentage population needs vaccinated covid really die delta play now? 10% 30% numbers, really stupid? Interesting. heard it‚Äôs stringent west. I‚Äôm Philly two CNAs right graduated high school within last year. prior healthcare work Good points, talking stages grief. talking wait Fox News Trump give talking points. Like okay Fauci Trump got jealous reporters paying attention Fauci, infectious disease expert, pandemic started attacking him, followers followed. think anything news. Fox OTA network shows Fox News programming regularly Sundays. Murdoch wanted sell Fox News Disney would fine that, Disney cable news organization. want two Big 4 OTA networks owned company.

Viacom allowed half stake CW, think 1. whole network 2. relevant network makes okay CBS. friend hospitalist DFW children‚Äôs hospital, sickest covid patients vaccine-eligible vast majority obese another high risk condition, least one unvaccinated parent close contact. children got them. aren‚Äôt actually.

Interesting point! types businesses actually actively seek I'm ever area, good them. opposite holds true businesses refuse allow people vaccinated masked enter, hope fail leave owners hopeless pile debt. Oh, believe me, noticed. bed week. Percentages isolation kind meaningless. Breakthrough hospitalizations exist. 100% vaccinated community, hospitalizations vaccinated people unvaccinated people don‚Äôt exist. 

If UK lower vaccination rate, like US, would LOT unvaccinated people crowding hospitals.

The percentage vaccinated hospitalizations go nation‚Äôs vaccination rate goes up. last week, district reported 551 active cases schools. East Cobb Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine warned parents Tuesday reached tipping point, ""dramatic rise pediatric infections."" practice canceling well visits upcoming weeks focus sick children, letter parents says.

This parents need know. kid needs go doctor, may get in. need mask get vaxxed. :D whole point aware antibodies correlated resistance COVID? lack staff states enticed away better offers ? actually dangerous kids though long term safety data. like stopped talking it. talked since pandemic begun, thwn stopped important anymore. Meanwhile lot people impression still thing. talking masks social distancing alternative herd immunity.  Take look study showing brain damage (loss gray matter) reduced brain activity, based almost 800 persons brain scans, *before* covid detected identified significant effects COVID-19 brain loss grey matter left parahippocampal gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex left insula. looking entire cortical surface, results extended anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus temporal  course fears safety. That‚Äôs 3 vaccine shots, tests daily, second got positive test result went antibody treatment despite asymptomatic.

(Source: dog's veterinarian expressed jealousy dog free fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, portable feast went outside tall grass) incentive? wouldn‚Äôt - part - students vaccinated throughout earlier years school? course schools going take money, either enroll online withhold grades cannot online classes. need graduate. got vaccine soon possible. I'll even wear mask force me. please let learn districts CO requiring masks staff students? Thanks. Hope things turn better soon us. Honestly think good people get vaccinated comply university mandates. That's number, data. Something tells matter, probably misread too. R rate growth way. daily cases plateau R 1.  fully vaxxed masked US citizen fuck that. tools need prevent death (vaccines masks). I'm going house arrest month save anti-vaxxers. realize AUS many vaccines available lockdown makes sense, situation completely different here. imagine support family near, kind anxiety someone grow acutely ill,‚Äù said Steve Edwards, CEO CoxHealth, whose hospital Springfield, Missouri, treating patients far away Alabama. Meanwhile, US urging 150 countries planning send leaders government ministers New York next month speak person UN‚Äôs annual general assembly meeting consider giving video address instead wouldn‚Äôt become ‚Äúa super-spreader event‚Äù. general assembly brings much east side midtown Manhattan halt, heavy security long parades vehicles ferrying world leaders entourages meetings, accommodations, restaurants consulates.  Works either age IQ. Jail! virus. cure. Treatments unlikely.

Vaccination virus running course realistic path. Hard enjoy retail dining you‚Äôre sick home. Great agreement! Let's make worse staff! also almost two year old, we're taking every precaution. months vaccinated... they've lived almost whole lives pandemic, little longer hurt (as hard us parents). Hang there, internet friend.

So sorry six year old. condolences. wish would grant emergency approval new formulation something better nothing suppose.  I‚Äôm curious. chicken pox mono adolescence didn‚Äôt make immune system stronger. think exposed diseases makes stronger also would knowingly flesh blood? extremely interesting article. Thanks that! Awesome! I'm glad mom supportive career choice. I've never understood parents would force kids career want kids may like. clearly success think succeed reality enjoy that's successful in. personally cut work form home, I'm glad enjoying hope well! I'm little curious though, dad reacted decision work home?  folks swamping hospitals south right mostly unvaccinated. Boosters great us already taking Covid seriously see anything cure epidemic stupidity. necessarily roughly 20% Australia vaxxed majority hospital vaxxed. Yes use California website. 

Also LA County, Healthvana Apple Wallet QR code access got vaccinated LA county. find name, go click ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù let know want get access Apple wallet version. smart avoiding getting sick. There's electronic music festival NYC coming two weeks. mask requirement, vaccine required, negative COVID test required. Also, mention COVID website Twitter. They're promoting afterparties. still eaten inside restaurant, gone movie theater. went 1 bar, once, June. see cousin play farewell gig band. still pretty nervous that. People realize many like me. fully vaccinated still want take risk. 50% vaccinated country horrible. kids? I‚Äôm surprised cannot tell there‚Äôs pandemic although live Dallas suburbs maybe that‚Äôs why. schools near mask mandates, everyone wearing masks stores, etc. think applies vaccine techniques. Currently several types vaccines available unlikely excuse used. 

I think even pope gave blessing least Catholics can't really use excuse. agree caution. mandates ""theater"" made situation toxic many areas. US, continue pretend COVID certain states keep beating daily seven day average high scores. Meanwhile, vaccination percent basically stuck 50%. Currently additional dose same. I'm honestly sure they're way. probably can't afford wait variant-specific vaccine. There's enough surplus existing vaccine, antibody levels dropping time, that's what's driving push 8-month boosters.  Wisconsin started yet either. actually got huge argument schools administrator phone enforcing masks pretty much flat said like homes school Covid effecting kids we're going enforce masks.  supported egomaniac president leveraged pandemic political capital. reap sow Mr. Bob Evans. Please retire Greenbrier already ""we dont know"" 1,000 words It‚Äôs creating demand companies he, GOP, donors invested (eg monoclonal antibody treatments).

This way get pretend ‚Äòsomething‚Äô making buck time. believes benefit vaccinating people.  mean we've started hold companies like Facebook actually accountable platform used disinformation campaign hostile countries. aware it, waited much long react still weak response. mask mandate Dallas (although teeth fought governor). Unfortunately, addition many children hospital covid, RSV really bad here. daughter hospitalized RSV (luckily PICU) back June seemed like entire ER waiting room kids RSV. schools back open, gotten worse. add Delta mix it‚Äôs disaster. 

I feel scared think would happen child like nephew, even ‚Äúsimple‚Äù case anaphylaxis, treatable injury. booster going formulation delta oriented?  kids go private Upper East Side school staff masked vaccinated. totally remote. Ah ty! Source? fully vaccinated, gives hope would like verify. Reimbursements literally done government. LTCs making zero profit right assure you. throwing money problem fixing either. think people trying solve problem decades dead wrong.  


Here something works. Testing, social distancing, masks, protocols, vaccine advocacy. could unilaterally mandate vaccines everyone would, pragmatic realize work staff actually any.  


I seen payroll CNAs 50 dollars hour. brain-dead solution one thought about. former competitive athlete think ptsd isnt causing inability exercise 14 years getting virus. Ancedotal thats funding research whats causing issue instead chauking ptsd anxiety LOL Nebraska. know to. need money. Online ultimately hurt attendance. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really complex that. blood pressure drops get white. need stay seated minutes done. find sucking candy like starburst helps. sugar + increased saliva benefit. also brought gatorade drink after. virus *may* successfully mutate one better Delta (I think one effective transmitting viruses we've faced), immune systems change too. cells generate one type antibody, change circumstance requires it. think reasons people go get vaccine secret.

A) Continued social pressure; ""Bob get it, he's fine""; combined with, 
B) Negative talk vaccine

Under heading ""negative talk"", think there's actually information coming two different places contribute vaccine hesitancy. First there's bullshit evil social influencers. 'Nuff said.

But vaccine hesitant people also hear stories vaccinated neighbors shots ""kicked butt"" ""made feel terrible 24 hours"".

I get everyone likes tell story, wish us zero side-effects would speak more. make point telling everyone notice jab all, point got paranoid wondered gave fake dose :) think dropped this: /s think many aggressive antivaxers guys there's still plenty them.

Half people work single jab yet, either 'haven't found time' good old 'want wait information' crap. We're 25-35 can't even blame boomerism.  Compassion important testament that. wish everyone would read said here. Ken Paxton wanker  seriously believe this? ""Yeah, poor gators.""

- Carol Fucking Baskin hope get tested feeling well. Hopefully clear minor cold. it, even minor case, prevent spread others. know QR code is, need patronize. Italy UK use verify vaccination status, suggested it. Sure, there‚Äôs always way falsify anything, it‚Äôs bit complicated printing template CDC card. It‚Äôs basically infectious disease known man.   peddling anti-vax propaganda.... treatment protect virus? happens get Covid again, get another round treatments? curious many vaccinated?   sent two kids, 8 4, back school. glad requiring masks indoors think mandating teachers vaccinated tested weekly. still feel like highly likely Covid spread schools. lunch recess kids masks off. nervous. report them? gunk whatever process they've got going on. Oh wow shocking.  Honestly think responsible call even respiratory illnesses besides COVID, manage (I realize many people get paid sick leave can't afford take time off, anyone cover them). I'm glad whatever seem affecting badly.  Sure, Foopa's point ending in-person schooling forever.  I‚Äôm finding weirdly ironic people refused go Walmart one Emergency Use Authorized treatment, they‚Äôre lining library floor, another possibly save lives.  state operated facility 

This public library.  Honestly straight cover like Vietnam war. Day day video footage ICU patients gasping air, healthy people 30s vents etc.

It sounds gruesome harsh people flat grasp severity crisis numbers alone. Crazy. reposted OP's photo yesterday /r/pics. popping everywhere national news. BIL posted Facebook. 

I've never part viral trend before. :) buddy mine sent that, needed something come back with. I'm lazy, figured Reddit would help. Thanks doctor, clearly.

Lol! saw right me!

Anyhoo, triaging thing surprise, surprise doesn‚Äôt make doctors administrators develop members certain heinous political party 20th century. much think arm chair analysis upon first made aware term counts expertise, really doesn‚Äôt. whether hospitals included vaccination status protocols, I‚Äôm currently aware wouldn‚Äôt surprised. guess US, 8 months probably chosen there's another antibody decline 4-6 months (completely unknown) happen seasonal fall wave period last year.

There's strong data suggesting either way best time third dose.

If trying decide whether personally get shot, probably mostly preference. FDA (who handle fallout issue) approved them, many/most state health departments (who handle delta) entirely favor them. Really system track doses local pharmacies expiring, pick likely booster candidates get arms. sure 4-6 months recent dose. yeah i'm shouting things talk co-workers lunch lmao calculated gamble sure, lung brain damage could worse long term another year partial virtual schooling. do. like french government asking vaccine pass.

As number, definitely support mask mandate indoor activities matter number people. I‚Äôm Mississippi think already know answer, large population people understand vaccine works intended use is? see many posts questioning someone get COVID they‚Äôve gotten vaccine. claims test positive COVID isn‚Äôt true vaccine. They‚Äôre still posting memes goat fruit Africa testing positive last year. I‚Äôm lose freaking mind.  yet speculate publicly anyway. people cherry pick one thing said justification whatever fuck want. NZ Australia 84% adult populations fully vaccinated, situation comparable Ireland's.  ICU beds available? go shopping wait one open up! race? What's prize? joke European understand? agree saying got POTS dysautomia...neither related stress PTSD. clearly physical manifestations present covid. course. governor Florida stopped promoting vaccines (he even called boosters question morning) favor monoclonal therapy. understanding doesn‚Äôt always work does, it‚Äôs early stage. need hospital, won‚Äôt help. lot people going hospital know it‚Äôs covid need hospital! frustrating. fail see story direct consequences outbreak topic. way, actually took whole \*fourteen\* years identify exact SARS progenitor.  COVID vaccine already made breakthroughs HIV vaccine, we'll see else do! Living London surprise me. Public transport means we've sitting petri dishes random people last 2 years. There's way passed me. Every day I'm box least 20 random strangers half hour skin doctor seeing 200% rise heart problems young people, every country's public data says 1:10'000 (for Germany 1:300'000), barely background rate. licensed skin doctor totally expert heart problems. going believe instead institutes devote track side effects vaccines medicines. AZ first(also adenovirus vaccine like J&amp;J), mRNA second worked well based studies UK, practically done lot Canada. suspect ok, generate good immune response, data.   20 percent identified cases first three weeks July state.

That number would 100% everyone vaccinated. meaningless number. Yes, US needs vaccine mandates mask mandates schools. see though again, sorry lol get boosters every 8 months vaccines too? Lmaooo Sounds like fear based finger pointing. Everyone knows migrants spreading Covid, locals. yeah right undercounting deliberate. sort leadership seeing FL TX mostly found 3rd world countries, DeSantis/Abbott hell bent sabotage personal gain. 

That said, circled back CDC dashboard today, see 1000+ death figure. probably higher Reuters today, least they're ball park. Nope, real. Delta AY.3 stats US found starting outpace current Delta dominant strain: soon, man.    One highly effective inexpensive masking system simply cloth mask top rated medical mask. medical masks really cheap, plus use one times. Putting cloth mask top increases effectiveness large amount sealing edges. Also fashionable matters you.

As need extrovert... know you, need protect around trumps long country mile. emerging information long term brain damage outcomes even mild cases easily overcomes concerns inconvenience. I‚Äôm curious, fake 2016?

Also, exact approach explained call entity‚Äôs bluff news-on certain programs seems, employ propagandists, gain air time crazier rants become, profit misinformation spread viewership.

*this whole handful billionaires controlling damn near everything-thing-sure working us isn‚Äôt it?*

Let‚Äôs kid here, mainstream outlet doesn‚Äôt really get anywhere population peaceful common, decent discourse possible without violence/oppression extremism.

They thrive shock awe, simple human minds fall directly snares like moths flame.

Talk neighbors help find truth don‚Äôt rely mainstream outlets, unless outlets putting airwaves undeniable truths science, that‚Äôs approach you‚Äôre board with..well hello there, *comrade* something I've struggling get solid numbers on, actual sources data available. UK study numbers put out, CDC data, paired Israeli info referencing, seems suggest fairly important:

A certain susceptible demographic continue susceptible, matter vaccination status. still encourage masks, cloth ones, please, unless $1.50 50packs surgical masks low supply again.

On end spectrum, remember realistic (yet) all-out panic scenario. Numbers maintained relative consistency past 2 years that:

Stats:\~2% Covid cases result death. (1.6% U.S.)\~80% hospitalizations (as March data) U.S. overweight individuals (\~30%) obese individuals (\~50%)\~80% deaths U.S. individuals 65 years old (30% 85+, 28% 75-84, 22% 65-64) around 13% U.S. deaths 50 years old. \*\*This statistic virtually identically mirrored 2020-2021 non-Covid pneumonia deaths (circa CDC), sitting right around 600k deaths.\~In U.K. delta study, virtually identical numbers vaccinated unvaccinated individuals died DELTA variant, common factor almost 50 years old.

So honest stats OVERWEIGHT OVER-65, substantially elevated risk. Get vaccinated, wear mask, please, careful.

If overweight 65 years old U.S., sure, odds dying COVID COVID 1 2,500; percentage, 0.0004%. odds getting COVID dying demo 0.00005% 1 20,000. put perspective:You're twice likely die drowning bathtub (depending source odds, lol.) odds dying stroke 1 1,500ish 0.0007%, perspective. HOWEVER: may feel comfortable statistics, likely safe mean disregard fellow man.

Plus, vaccinated wearing mask may not, statistically, change odds dying much healthy weight 65, substantially reduces odds getting ill/seriously ill. 


And given vaccinations seem stopping transmission slowing deaths overweight individuals 65, ask again, please stop wearing mask. still system, likely. Getting test CT score returned tell likely contagious.

Someone recovered recently similar level immunity someone vaccinated. Someone recovered vaccinated far higher level immunity. immunity complete. Whether worth risk reinfection (tiny) times cost reinfection (variable) versus cost quarantine (???) you. Simple things like keeping windows open cross-ventilation certainly lower risk pretty good factor. Good. mean, all, point? yes. black; course Trump Fox care. Yes, vaccine free. 

Get boosters stop deadly pandemic. 

Children get series shots diseases anyway. Interestingly, normalized population, US UK [pretty much identical](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=countries-normalized&amp;highlight=United%20Kingdom&amp;show=25-lg&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right-8wk-wks&amp;extra=United%20States#countries-normalized) (fast growing) slope new cases.  Unfortunately, likely deadly dangerous phase pandemic yet.

I hope mean outside first world. post every wednesday, screenshot last wednesday apparently see unvaxxed 93% hospitalizations deaths past week per user outsider, say quite baffled sheer stupidity conservatives. vaccine free. COVID numbers dropping February June, school districts though could get without mandate.  Good luck finding one point. sure would nice though. hear countries good job southern united states struggling, people continuing daily lives nothing going on. Central Alabamian here, work requires masks, anywhere else public even know pandemic. I've never voted thought never really mattered. Turns Texas pandemic changed mind. past year first time voted hope turn things around inspire public interest voting current state affairs ridiculous. Correct. instead want people get vaccinated‚Ä¶and kids, too! (Did follow thread responded to?) exactly know it! written package! least, think that's fancy words are....

/s Well, think say much point we've extricated post covid symptoms stress symptoms PTSD issues. There's many confounders clear signal, scepticism best policy stage. One posters found good study suggesting brain damage observed pre post covid scans relatively close together. interesting, still one study see time time careful, check study carefully (I hope I'll time tomorrow) look evidence. mean might true, careful claiming something real eliminated variables quantified left.
I lot experience post viral illness patients show almost every permutation sun, there's likely still confounders too, debilitation leads stress psychological issues many people, especially dismissed family, work medics. 
I think careful simple easy answers think happening, hard work research. CA requires masking weekly covid tests. like states masks forbidden. read mentioned cross protection covid MMR vaccine well. one theory children mainly mildly symptomatic asymptomatic. much higher MMR titers, theorized provide cross protection. Months old.  Oregonian send kid first grade, information makes slightly less anxious. Honestly think gone war footing done April 2020 vaccine. vaccinated people really high risk think lot get fine details.

But yes different. Dangerous jobs chance getting exposed injured. injuring someone might die might die. high ethical bar. supposedly one done UK data know even started. put perspective nearly 1,500 people die every day UK things

Adding 80 deaths day normal 1500 increase 5%. That's definitely catastrophic ICUs filling kind bad, definitely good. guess that's threshold UK that's considered acceptable-ish (I get UK completely back normal). That's going weird ethical question every country tackle...although US likely ignore ethical issues push ""stock market"" half population would rather die get vaccine wear mask. would effectively mean discriminate sets religions priests.

The Methodists, example, might issue that, encourage lay preachers. ‚Äúregular‚Äù blood clots, low platelet / thrombocytopenia clots? former, know low dose aspirin help prevent this? well. never rescheduled may 2020 trip. don‚Äôt see happening long time sadly I'm also biology also understanding. could common vector nature virus could come back though. say tests every virus existence, self isolated month, tested everybody again, cured ones long term viruses (HIV etc.). would still saying long would take another strain pop nature domesticated animals etc. Maybe even safe long, again, clue :D course does. Antibodies bound wane, memory cells react swiftly infected, reduce severity likely reduce transmission. Wish could Germany :( Boris plan best plan, let virus run wild, kill shit tonnes people, outbid poor countries vaccines rush finish line. Yay first freedom.

/unqualified rubbish opinion. protection serious illness wanes 8 months post vaccination claim data back up. said staffers lost relatives friends providing care rural hospital. ""A nurse, sonographer one physicians lost someone either Saturday Sunday Covid. youngest 21, oldest 38,"" McCabe told Squyres, physician hospital, said KWTX, ""I lost brother Saturday. waited five days ICU bed never way knowing ICU bed would saved him,"" Squyres said.

Inception arrived. said common cold many varieties provide immunity other. absolutely three common colds right other. more. I'll take ground keeps innocent people dying disease. Damn rules. ignorance; selfishness. mean, get that. saying, looking UK case numbers right now, I'm assuming herd immunity cards anymore? every story china story Trump admin's failures. Yeah, I'd never argue protecting people's health information, definite consequence reality disease held behind curtain. kind pictures significantly powerful statistics. Added edit consumption since want continue spread misinformation 8 months timeline: someone team. need boosters eventually, you‚Äôre wrong 8 months know point yet. more, get vaccinated live life... Indoor dining still open Cali. bars clubs.. take calculated risk go business.  one knows happen going forward, uncharted territory. I'm sure help. old idea we'd reach herd immunity 70-80% population protection vaccine prior infection seems proven false. Show us anything indicates health outcomes worsen infection post 8 months full vaccination. source... Would Albuterol inhalers help COVID? used get bronchitis lot kid doctor would usually give inhaler. hospitals start putting unvaccinated patients parking lot due lack resources couldn‚Äôt hurt give inhaler. ‚ÄúSuck bit roll Christ, brother.‚Äù trying asshole seems like inhaler would better nothing point. virtual education effectively usrless (you someone know may like it, get barely anything it) person education worth thr risk according AAP, CDC others.  mean discounts exercise,reimbursements memberships, etc already thing many insurance companies. thing herd immunity case, least scientific perspective. Antibodies reduce severity infection likelihood spread, won‚Äôt stop either, largely due high transmissibility Covid. states opinion. link data confirming Fauci's statement. said disproven. not, fact data backs statement provided it. Flat positivity part recent weeks declining Rt throughout United States well. Dave Blake predicting peak hospitalization 5 days so. Seems like lot hot spots close peak. we‚Äôre really lucky, they‚Äôll make sure give children well. Thinking back pandemic, 3-6 months sounds right intervals sick. remember thinking ‚Äúoh sick, likely won‚Äôt get sick now, least months‚Äù I‚Äôd get another cold flu whatever 3-6 months later.

I guess ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù would possible, we‚Äôre advanced enough technologically that.  really know help them. 

Let natural selection take course fewer people next generation deal issue. meant banning requiring them, banning period Israel reporting vaccine efficacy waning primarily aged &amp; seniors, ppl 60. 40 chances hospitalized slim, CDC wants get booster prevent transmission. there's realization 1/4 population get shots, small minority get severely ill &amp; clog &amp; bring hospital system winter. Seriously, even talking bringing bunch off-topic issues? story China's concerted effort stymie investigation undeniable point. Even officials confirming this. That's it. One thing would help, direct infrastructure money building (much needed) rural hospitals. places across Florida panhandle 50-60 mile ride nearest hospital. UK. believe everything article need talking to. There‚Äôs thing Covid, least hugely reduce spread hospitalisations stay low.   BUT, equal. Everyone equal got experience. saw saw, geo blocking, tracking piecemeal resetting cookies basically made new person far sites knew. Sure harder find good information, gave ENORMOUS amount it.  gateway drug‚Ä¶..to vaccines depends countries discussing. already many vaccines expire country can‚Äôt convince everyone vaccinated. Almost exactly twice many officers died last year Covid duty causes combined. Get vaccinated mask up.

Source:  Well, compared before, easy see countries least 70% vaccinated controlling Delta better countries vaccination rates number.  caught situation control want discuss political side r/politics place this. mean, especially considering kind vacation Disney represents - lots time crowds, indoors strangers, boats monorails strangers. 

I wondering long it'd take happen even throughout earlier parts pandemic reopened, think still first article I've seen relates Florida's economy taking hit. want everyone fine. Colleges put measures place protect students getting infected. Betting good outcome unnecessary simple, free vaccine dramatically enhance students‚Äô safety. wonder previous generations like this? mean, reading accounts seems though saw duty common sense get whatever new vaccine was. wonder nuts like ones now? security has, suspect potential threats life viewed campaign opportunities legitimate threats. I'm trying point something law, mean moral. What's ""moral"" decision behind banning mask mandate? religious text says immoral? (R)s can't bothered decent human beings lives instead contrarian azzholes? claim making backed data. Providing WSJ article links another WSJ article (behind paywall less) ""proof"" proof. Neither saying Fauci discussing TV. Show us proof retract claim. smacks misinformation.  Im sure that. vaccinated getting sick much unvaccinated seems. beg differ; vaccines long term solution. stuff, especially demanding people isolate weeks end, unsustainable. schools reopen summer, we‚Äôll truly find are, especially enter winter months. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible given current level technology development. vaccines effective, 100% effective. don‚Äôt know 100% effective (doesn‚Äôt mean none, don‚Äôt know.) Havimg antibodies still protective, may prevent serious infection. friend mine COVID able work home bad cold vs. worst flu ever travel go see dying mum dad family member. going fucking Disneyland (or -world) comparison, New York‚Äôs peak 18,825, one idea virus.  Check previous comment study link. drop, Pfizer dropping faster point effectiveness similar AZ 4-5 months. Honestly, need pictures like gets people serious Covid many people impacted.  someone team, stating you‚Äôre making point talking points different, Faucci didn‚Äôt make call. administration did. face effort. depends go, I‚Äôve seen places masks others least half people masked. Bro would format c: could.  He‚Äôs worried getting primaried far right Republicans. Lots dems would never vote matter what. could mask mandate whole state win handful votes. 

The people vote hard republicans though? don‚Äôt want masks, vaccines, shutdown, anything. either don‚Äôt think Covid bad don‚Äôt believe masks/vaccines make difference. voters currently running state controlling politics. sedentary people pay more? wear sunscreen? overeat? promiscuous? 100% agree. kids online learning first semester vaccine approved age group, one kids respiratory condition make idea catching COVID rather scary. 

That said, I'm really hoping send back person soon. articles said epidemiologists ""predict"" Florida, hotzone Delta, peak next week. plateau coming none soon. Probably not. Even four Coronaviruses waning immunity infection, reinfection possible several months. hope vaccination would superior that, apparently much. 

So given time there'll enough people infected. It'll endemic virus.

Which bad, long prior infection/vaccination attenuates severity illness.

Still, could like added flu season (on top troubles Influenza gives us), great. it'll something health care providers notice, care plan for; public probably notice much eventually. Wait.... concerned???? two people heart transplants years back fully vaccinated die covid think don‚Äôt enough trained nurses. supported math.

Breakthrough cases happen 0.00004% rate (based current CDC numbers) US. multiply 10. even low covid death rate 1%, reach 95% vaccination (for 328M US population) ratio still flip. Fact virus probably stop risk vaccinated folks long even happens risk infection someone might breakthrough case decreases also vaccination increases. opposite true eventually breakthrough become ever rare.  protection infection Delta drops almost 50% four months, people immunocompromised, governors, simply willing potentially lie get third shot so. 

but people sub talk great still hospitalization. great running public policy great I'd individual thinks getting really sick long term symptoms something like avoid, hospital no. much this. probably got caught someone told them:

Hey, kids wear masks!

They replied ""No worries, also fully vaccinated, see?"" really hope right everyone's sake I'm sorry go this. Herd immunity never scientific concept Covid, largely political. Microbiologist. don‚Äôt medical background, theoretically speaking, couldn‚Äôt virus become extinct entire human population self-isolate particular virus‚Äôs incubation period? know would never happen, another means virus spread? Huh. Weird. would thought giving virus ""freedom"" circulate freely would end hampering businesses. Almost like restrictions help businesses end. hate break - done absolutely shit Facebook. algorithmic feed was, promoting rage-inducing radicalizing disinformation. still ""only"" substantial county, surrounded high matter time. 72% total population least one dose vax hope helps wave fully hits. ‚Äúwe‚Äù mean exactly? Absolutely astonishing dumfoundingly pathetic many people willing allow government force put something body employed pay bills eat shelter lmfaoooo SOOOOOO pathetic. get older realize many people followers lack common sense. crippling. gf never ever get vaccine unless choice. someone TELLS get pay bills that's crosses line. violation human rights anyone thinks otherwise dumb fuck. Idgaf law says. law words paper. live, die, live life based common sense abide God given rights. Nobody tell body. PERIOD. pathetic easily bend get ass. people respect anymore? people respect fuckin God given rights?! Ugh I'm rambling cuz can't find right words explain God given rights angers beyond belief. Mark words people country accept na mandate violent push back mandate.   office national statistics, analysis antibodies bulletin based blood test results taken randomly selected subsample individuals aged 16 years over, used test antibodies SARS-CoV-2. Doh, totally right. bet single state represented graph agree 100%. feel way. know way worse things would loved take daughter well. Shes especially princesses age. We‚Äôre simple people. see Garth comment section, ruin comment section. Yes juggle data make story. deaths per day actually caused Covid nowhere near high. someone else said, i'm random redditor, live Uk work closely related field. Take want, makes difference long run. Media want story make people read articles, life Uk tells different story. Believe whatever data want, makes difference me, I'm saying article facts peppered hyperbole. Yes. spreading bad advice 

Why would get upvotes?  Personally I've luck actually finding open time slot Walgreens rapid test. Honestly hybrid option can't commit full wfh good cleaning staff too, less people work around, wins around.  Yes, correct. articles said bit clearly. Plus, little common sense could verify daily. 21k new infections per day Florida, 80% infections resulting hospitalization, would real breaking news.  like use Red Blue like political map welcome opinion. want live city friends among 0.2% humans weird me. one went 9 million.. ooof. something lot racists reddit - anytime anything positive posted India, try say something negative/demotivating. India solar project shit streets, India satellite bobs vagine, etc etc. Classic Reddit people downvoted.
You could update comment say Awesome! 9 million.. get better soon. Something positive.
Or ignore downvotes, cares. commented amused downvoted reason. lol. could be, far know, last official post festival issue saying would require proof tweet like three weeks old things obviously changed. word event organizers though, know of. I'm confused clear it. Welp, going interesting thread follow coming months. Hope bad think be. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah, assumption vaccinated people still getting delta, symptoms. supposed still mask. Since vaccinated still transmit vaccinated people. 

So I'm assuming delta go away literally everyone gotten it. going like chickepox, hopefully cause something like lung shingles 50 years now.

Not shocked all. another data point disputing Pfizer's claims 8 months/boosters?

I spent 4 hours plane next virus researcher 10 days ago[no, dox him, already death threats masks]. 
Among gems mentioned ""watch corporate push boosters coming up"". Pharma/Pfizer apparently spreading idea boosters awhile among researchers look data revealed case made. say cannot/will ""true"" point obvious misinformation pushed, ostensibly boost profits [far profitable sell boosters US taxpayers supply vax 3rd world arguably much effective aim reduce Covid impact long term]

Strangely [and hurts say this] Trump made statement morning eg boosters money grab  Taking 5 minutes go get free vaccine shot hard. It‚Äôs much easier read thousands conspiracy theories day mental gymnastics organize protests avoid simple thing.  understand population density higher England US (duh), wonder contributing factor  that, politicians would stop trusted.

I mean regardless thing trust politicians fuck over. comparison UK three times population Florida third total amount people hospitals. That's thinking. Honestly wish facility would turn people away ill treatment help them. need waste resources. took Nyquil shots AZ Moderna. headaches fever body aches bad shots. tired whining Nyquil thing shut upüò¥ reduce effectiveness vaccines dunno hope not. Anybody thread who‚Äôs arguing efficacy vaccinations lost sight even valid arguments they‚Äôre fueling anti-vax rhetoric.


At point it‚Äôs kind hard imagine people already vaccinated still skeptical vaccinations. anyone else starting dislike people life previously issues with? Due opinions Covid Trump related things 2020 2021? Sure, number depend considered ""covid death"", sound like still people dying covid right now. Harvesting weird argument, say 80 year grandma lived another 10 20 years. harvesting argument is...iffy, best ethical standpoint. 

Point covid still kill people government decide many deaths acceptable given level ""normalcy"". Normalizing covid deaths, even fairly low level, also runs risk making difficult reimplement covid protocols new variant threatens us. I'm saying anything wrong UK doing, ethically weird spot choices come risks positive negative results. Would love 12 shot become available ~~ 

I know; Preaching choir  title misleading. 
If read article, 80% England vaccinated 14% antibodies natural antibodies covid. 

The vaccines work. worth risk many all. Unfortunately poorest abused children NEED person schooling order develop antisocial behaviors damaging society, get food, shelter, care don‚Äôt have. class gap ever widening poor and/abused falling deeper chasm. But, also don‚Äôt want kid school privileged enough educated enough teach them.  national news? respected journalists?

Sure news national journalists respected. hitting Fox Facebook group, group need hit.

The filter bubbles already strong. would interesting see excess death figures, Iran accused underreporting deaths. Surely way 100k, especially fifth wave low vaccination rates.

It would also interesting know cases much worse, reporting better now?

Anyway good finally vaccinating people.  criminal AG? Kind lot em...I can't keep up... makes sadder major changes (Magic Hours, Park Hopping PAID FP+...) ostensibly caused using pandemic excuse.

I wish could taken daughter this. once.  Yeah lot vaccinated folk covid vaccine. take 14% population covid, actual number bigger quite margin What's like live country intelligent population? God damn Americans fucking stupid.  vaxxed friend told yesterday pregnant second. weren‚Äôt even trying. crazy people believe that. Yeah would concerned. see various autoimmune disorders constantly stimulated immune system increased risk blood cancers like lymphoma leukemia. think now, benefit third shot outweighs worries don‚Äôt think go rest lives getting booster shot every months without safety concern. 

(I already third booster heartbeat) eligible early anyways.. 8 months would New Years problem communicating information. That, figured out. issue finding information true, spreading that. think underlying issue trust pervades new information landscape. trust? CDC initially recommended masks, later admitted lie try get masks hospitals stockpiles. CDC lied then, maybe they're lying now? trust doctors say vaccine safe effective, trust doctors say opposite? trust studies pharma companies profit sale drugs?

I think unsolved issue getting people trust right sources information. problem idea solve.  It‚Äôs approved children ages 12 *if* also 88 pounds more. Deaths higher unvaccinated people, infections too.  25+ normal human brain finishes developing around time live back pre covid normal prices higher lol.

I've back working people's homes months pre covid, shops open, masks mostly optional international travel potentially risky due traffic light systems place, country goes red gets costly far I'm aware. contagious Delta would probably take us ""measles"" territory. Ouch. Hey guys sorry isn‚Äôt right thread couldn‚Äôt find place ask vaccine questions. 

To keep short second dose coming chills fever. Every post see mentions sucks can‚Äôt sleep.

My question take NyQuil get good nights sleep. missing warning? Every post complaining I‚Äôm sitting thinking shot NyQuil put stop fever good idea? UK basically lowest vaccine hesitancy world. think comes percentages - voting percentages.

First, anti-mask/anti-vax people, care spread lie overblown.

Then, people vaccinated, feel like followed everything supposed to, completely done hard mitigation, let unvaxxed reap sow. They'll still wear mask, they'll go spend time friends, go restaurants, go bars, travel, etc. find definitely true young adults vaccinated anyone childless.

That leaves much smaller percentage people want limit gathering sizes, mask everywhere, remote learning. find mostly concentrated people younger kids active social media, appears much larger percentage people actually is.

So, left probably 15-25% people want hard mitigation, another 30-60% cool masks that's really it, remaining want nothing. say was, technically wrong. seems likely willing wear least long, point peak, right? taken decades reach point effort eradicate polio. close total eradication, we're lose progress made Taliban halt vaccination efforts. I'm sure coincidence editor used word ""rat"" right picture asshole.  Thankfully generally seem minor.

Then worked. contingency plans would cost money - think board investors? like require vaccine passports also require PTO get vaccine. become oppressive without component. Oh, 100% Northern France. Cops really getting chance show last 5 years so.  hope people watching. Thanks! 

I'm better Wellbutrin mirtazapine. 8 months ago sure would alive past year. So.. I'm trying make it. Yeah, still terrifying.   Glad hear this, honestly. Im way. run errands wear mask like hour something (I WFH) throat always sore get home. *""The monoclonal antibody treatments need injected directly vein via IV infusion, takes time dedicated medical staff, often using equipment reserved chemotherapy patients.""*

That sounds much better sticking needle seconds! would probably end issues immunompromised patients, exactly supposed protect. It‚Äôll become endemic. endemic doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll like now. people caught different strains many times years, won‚Äôt nearly problematic. require boosters vaccine wears off? Lmao 9 10 people spread base case fallacies right handed ü§î mean im completely utterly pro vaccinations. fuck guy reply indicate anti vax afraid shots? like this, going use ""annoy death"" ""pressure people threating jobs"", make legal requirement. Otherwise rich hard replace want, small guys get trembled on.   94% antibodies

I'm sure one question. ideas could ask:

So, trust ""personal responsibility"" office profess parents school kids. Got it. I'm bit confused looking perspective. gathering 10 people 8 fully vaccinated, risk getting Covid?

Heresy! One two local hospital systems put statement weeks status means hospital officials defer non-emergency surgeries hospitals throughout Central Florida division. Health officials said outpatient surgery sites conduct time-sensitive urgent procedures. Time-sensitive pediatric procedures conducted approval chief medical numbers put Florida Hospital Association, since state releasing details directly more, hospitalizations increasing, % capacity used increasing slower rate. way could happening expansion capacity reducing admissions non-COVID patients. Really surprising. Actual cases always much higher official case count. would way straightforward. Downright comprehensible. say ""most elderly Covid patients vaccinated!"" let implication Vaccine Ineffectiveness hang air unmitigated context statistical intuition.

Breaking character, can't help fume presented naked statistic ""what percentage cases breakthrough cases?"" shit IRRELEVANT. Without context, misleading, context, still irrelevant important information context.

All say, right, right. Believe not, yes. reduction is, fact, slightly less. It‚Äôs hard math people understand, it‚Äôs moderate increase (of symptomatic disease) small number. careful, also, looking data compares breakthrough infections original efficacy numbers without differentiating symptomatic asymptomatic presentations.

So tired unqualified people comparing apples oranges bagels. True, largely terms protection symptomatic covid, rather serious illness death. Booster shots vulnerable people something UK proven efficiency infrastructure rollout effectively, I'm worried front personally. places specifically required e.g. London public transport personal experience 70% people wear masks. go settings like shops previously required generally recommended politely asked shops themselves, probably less 50% varies go. local Waitrose (posh supermarket) probably 70%+ people wearing masks still, whilst went Westfield (a shopping mall) recently probably 30-40% wearing masks. Pretty much one wears masks outdoors never required UK (and repeatedly told UK masks pointless outdoor settings). tell everyone else to. didn‚Äôt even realize nurse jabbed me. making small talk, bam‚Ä¶she slapped bandaid me. Felt absolutely nothing. may see unlikely cases. unlikely, mean happen. incredibly high statistic infection rates, equally high statistic death relative percentage. Infection rate 2 weeks ago roughly 21,000 new cases per day. 110 died exactly 2 weeks ago, .5% chance death vaccine. include infections days surrounding, get really low percentage likely going filled quite people vaccinated. that's supposition based really crap map.   Currently 90%+ inside shops, maybe 50% streets outside. think taking pessimistic angle this, again, fair enough. perspective, UK general 1500 deaths per day causes, time.

Don't get wrong, tons things wrong system, one them. surge got like 60k cases day subsided settled around 30k cases day we've sat month now. rules basically went 19th July we've schools summer relatively good weather.

Things seem okay ground right now. Hospitals coping numbers part, though dealing gnarly backlogs last year half disrupted service. Everything *feels* normal there's never guarantee pulled away again.

The issues still billions people aren‚Äôt vaccinated, getting first rush immunity infection much painful vaccinating them. spread among vaccinated people isn‚Äôt necessarily problem severity much similar flu. 

This understanding though. could wrong, someone better understanding things feel free correct me. Please /u/Switzerland_Forever come tell irish data impossible. CDC public messaging big cluster. Especially back said vaccinated people didn‚Äôt need wear masks. Guess what, made everyone wear mask! mean prejudice say Irish people went get vaccine go bar.

am crazy could change name vaccine something else let weirdo cult leader types take credit it? intended correct assumption (80% adult population) 87.3% adult population. conflating adult total population, though understand interpreted comment different way.

Mandating vaccinations mid-October probably almost impact. 2 months in-classroom teaching probably spread pretty thoroughly then. Government mandates little late time, current partisan resistance. need people vaccinated matter, else close schools, sufficient support. So, we'd better get used hospitalizations deaths continuing climb next several months. Unless Delta burns whole state/country sooner that...

No, legitimate concerns would likely feel exact shoes. like skipping beach house visit going hurt anyone; go another time COVID's actually died down, there's productive fun things family safer still enjoyable.

The good news 65 so, healthy, vaccinated, COVID likely pretty minor illness you--even vaccine efficacy wanes. older, and/or lots preexisting conditions, going long-term event find theraputics really work well. well could happen next years. then, expect continual surges cases different parts world different times.

New Zealand done great job managing pandemic bit geographic luck. However, they'll face point lot people going get sick. Lockdowns places like US barring catastrophic variant. However, life COVID stay. disagree scientists literally said flu dangerous kids?

I hope able come conclusion comfortable with. remember whatever choose perfectly fine choice, try worry option would better. tough reality right now, alone. Ok saying conflicts source posted. source says get breakthrough case liable spread unvaccinated positive. likelihood infection equal. 

As 100 vaccinated people ship getting it, I'm particularly surprised breakthrough infections happen. 100 cases tight quarters proof vaccinated people ""just likely get it"" unvaccinated people. 

And saying that's skewed way look data is... completely wrong. look things per capita, otherwise population people inherently going ""more risky"" going cases, simply people around infected. \#unblocktommybuns People higher levels melanin...the go-to fear.

DeBlasio said everything ""return normal"" City September 13--kids return in-person classes, workers return offices crowded subways, etc. we're dealing variant spread among children. many adults, September 5-6 months they've vaccinated. seems like perfect storm may brewing...  Cool stuff, slick stuff No, added back days died. Essentially, delays deaths making headlines like ""453 reported deaths Florida today!"" instead ""Today, Florida recorded 10 deaths august 12th, 13 deaths august 13th, 22 deaths august 14th""...and on.

Honestly, bad way record things want go back study epidemiology pandemic later, mean time, softens gruesome impact rising death toll.

Boy correct.  1. Israel 94% antibodies adult population
2. Loosened restrictions Delta became dominant variant, whereas UK loosened restrictions gradually Delta became dominant variant
3. recently arrived 60% full vaccination rate good majority people newly vaccinated
4. Vaccine efficacy seems wane much quicker Pfizer, whereas UK also used AZ
5. Israel opted shorter dosing interval (3 weeks) opposed longer, effective dosing interval (8-12 weeks)

Even world without Delta, Israel would still dealing surge due waning immunity low overall vaccination numbers. Unlike UK, Israel got complacent vaccination program they're seeing results complacency. way prevent drastic measures!!!

Not electing willfully stupid people good place start. Considering good mRNA vacines are, 0 doubt retool shot whatever migrate into. mean crying loud testing vaccine HIV, toughest thing create vaccine for.

That leaves production approval process need updated. common carrier subcomponent maybe factories setup produce could FDA approve quick approvals needed updates. mRNA would true miracle could stamp Covid every virus. live uk, know people havent wont get shot. feels hopeless many change mind personally experience it, even might doubt it.

I don‚Äôt know why.  89.6% UK adults least one dose vaccine, 61.1% entire population fully vaccinated. 

So vaccines made people antibodies, rest community transmission. anybody wondering still huge numbers infections, almost 40% population fully vaccinated.  Right. Though, it‚Äôs healthcare systems.

By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter

On Sunday, Anchorage-based Alaska Airlines Capt. Eric Moss, 53, died COVID-19 shortly testing positive coronavirus, third employee airline die virus within past month.

A person knowledge Alaska Air‚Äôs COVID-19 response specific cases said three employees unvaccinated.

The deaths came airline mounted campaign last week encourage employees get vaccinated cusp decision make vaccinations mandatory, religious medical exemptions.

Moss‚Äô death followed maintenance mechanic Bay Area end July customer-service representative Seattle month. 

Moss‚Äô death announced airline‚Äôs pilot group internally friends family two children Facebook. Alaska spokesperson Alexa Rudin confirmed three recent deaths, declining name employees.

‚ÄúWe terribly sorry. never want lose employees,‚Äù Rudin said. ‚ÄúWe COVID-related deaths. COVID case rates generally trended U.S. average.‚Äù

There‚Äôs information three employees may picked virus whether work.

And Rudin could confirm unvaccinated status three died. ‚ÄúPer company policy, don‚Äôt comment personal health information employees,‚Äù said.

The required action colleagues contact three died varies according vaccination status.

Alaska‚Äôs policy nonvaccinated employee exposed coronavirus must quarantine 14 days, exposed, vaccinated employees advised monitor symptoms test three five days exposure, self-isolating test positive.

Rudin said though it‚Äôs known whether passengers might exposed contact infected employees, people airport inside plane protection offered wearing masks.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs reason masks,‚Äù said.

Pressure grows vaccination mandate

Even latest deaths, pressure building Alaska consider vaccination mandate following imposition mandates employees Google, Microsoft Amtrak, well airlines including United, Frontier Hawaiian.

In memo last week strongly suggestive imminent decision, management told employees ‚Äúwe looking closely whether we, too, require employees vaccinated.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs employer duty keep safe given contagiousness health risks COVID-19 virus variants, within rights make decision ask information vaccine status,‚Äù memo states.

Delivered weeknights, email newsletter gives quick recap day's top stories need-to-know news, well intriguing photos topics spark conversation wind day.

Such requirement would effective ‚Äúuntil least one vaccine fully approved FDA would include appropriate religious medical exemptions,‚Äù memo adds.

A June poll Kaiser Family Foundation found 30% unvaccinated adults would likely get vaccinated vaccine receive full approval Food Drug Administration.

President Joe Biden said July expects fully approved vaccine early fall. New York Times reported FDA accelerated schedule aiming go beyond current emergency-use approval Pfizer coronavirus vaccine fully approve vaccine early next month.

Rudin said Alaska could announce decision earlier, company would make effective full approval granted.

‚ÄúWe fundamentally believe power vaccines protect people,‚Äù said.

The person knowledge Alaska‚Äôs COVID-19 response plans said employee exempted vaccination take weekly coronavirus test.

In meantime, faced spread contagious delta variant, Alaska reinstated requirement employees wear masks company office buildings. Last week‚Äôs memo urged everyone ‚Äúto get vaccinated protect safety safety employees around you.‚Äù

In addition, employees asked complete form confirming vaccination status, declining answer considered ‚Äúnot vaccinated.‚Äù

Rudin said management use data inform decision whether needs make vaccination mandatory.

On airline‚Äôs internal employee websites, University Washington doctors offer advice coronavirus protection available answer employee questions vaccine safety. 

Airline unions critical

Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines pilots union, Air Line Pilots Association, currently contract talks, criticized management providing incentives vaccination making easier schedule time get shots. 

‚ÄúThe company failed come agreement,‚Äù union leadership said statement Tuesday. ‚ÄúFurthermore, adding problem recently, management criticized pilots using sick time middle pandemic.‚Äù

Back February, aircraft mechanics union, AMFA ‚Äî Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association ‚Äî also criticized Alaska management changing policy disciplining members use accrued sick leave.

The union claimed forced mechanics choice ‚Äúeither call sick risk counseling discipline, ‚Ä¶ come work symptoms risk infecting co-workers.‚Äù

On hand, unions insist Alaska management impose involuntary vaccination mandate without first negotiating union.

In contrast, Canadian government made decision entire transportation industry ‚Äî difference approach highlights politically charged nature vaccine mandate decision U.S. 

Last week, Transport Canada, Canadian regulator, announced vaccine mandate apply federal employees end September workers federally regulated industries end October.

At time, vaccination requirement apply air traffic controllers well Canadian airline pilots, cabin crew, mechanics dispatchers. also extended time commercial passengers traveling air, rail large ship.

To reassure air travelers, U.S. airlines rely Harvard School Public Health study published last year.

Citing study, funded major U.S. airline lobbying group, blog Alaska‚Äôs website declares confidently layered protections board, including mask-wearing, ‚Äúflying airplane safer grocery shopping eating out.‚Äù party expected‚Ä¶.but surprisingly shocked location.

Covid different.  Booster shot 2.5 months 2nd pfizer. I'm immunosuppressive meds. debating waiting, decided get now. I'm assuming 4th shot 8 months 2nd dose booster say booster immunosuppressed acts like equalizer others ""This can't nice things."" - Garth Brooks, probably. Great him. I've exhausted life's savings waiting events return. I'm going financially survive Covid. UK lockdown months, everything reopened, interval doses 9 weeks instead 3. also rely solely Pfizer vaccines. states allow people younger 18 consent vaccines, nitpicking point. Good Guy Garth.

Hey Jeans  That's drives crazy. drives crazy give percentage people die fully vaccinated put number people died since start pandemic. No. number since March.  3% might say 7%.  want number.

I friends work Florida ICU‚Äôs it‚Äôs pretty shitty time right now. see lot people say vaccinated, **young ""healthy"", think ok live mostly normally. Obviously risk tolerances vary, I'm wondering people consider ""healthy"" context.**

Some seem conflate immunosuppressed something similarly debilitating (with respect COVID), % points population. Others seem consider single comorbidity negating ""healthiness"", despite fact \~40% US population obese, thus least one comorbidity. Add others, even overlap, probably 50-60% population least one comorbidity. Probably lower young people, granted, still big % - people's tone seems indicate (that is, people's tone seems assume majority people ""healthy"").

But clarify mean healthy, someone desperately seeking validation decisions spending much time reading Reddit comments, thought I'd solicit opinions - perhaps others wonder same, too. Wait, he's still alive? people don‚Äôt understand he‚Äôs popular musician generation USA‚Ä¶. I'm starting think build wall around Florida.

There figures many kids end hospital days? parents find kid's teacher (or school staff) decided pull ""religious exemption"" covid vaccine parents move child another class? 

I would want kid taught someone refused vaccine. think he's asking respiratory rate, heart rate. normal 12-20. worse anything state seen - question is, worse e.g. NYC? 1000 times load that. state allowing 12 get vaccine?

""omitting"" that? think relevance fact is, story? I'm asking honestly, understand point intend make, I'd like to. stories -- aggregate -- prompt anyone get vaccine then, yes course.

Apparently 10% people wear them, 50% car accident deaths.

Same thing motorcycle helmets... difference feeling prevented.

In case gun violence lot conservatives believe take precautions long right things living right way gun violence befall you.

This turn blind eye poor inner city gun violence, conservatives poor person inner city crime first place, people low societal hierarchy, anything bad happens must deserved.

Coronavirus explode world view invisible force actually something prevent killing - vaccine. random white kids living ""good part town"" start dying virus expectation escape living point higher hierarchy destroyed flock vaccine en masse.

It start happening lot though, point becomes undeniable actually happening.

I think bit disingenuous. really know likely new variant deadly. Chump move. Disappointing untold thousands.

They would everyone able willing get them. They're also still effective tool have. Fuel meets fire. great important comment. well said. scientific reason indoor events 1,000 people subject proof vaccination? 800 people indoor events? 500 people indoor events? California making decisions based science? Eh - higher easier drop faster quickly. Pifzer's still effective AZ (even AZ logistics benefit). safety standards medical staff residents trumps whatever staffing situation may be.

I say nurse used work understaffed nursing home. We'd scheduled trip January, hoping kids would able vaccinated cases would low, since cancelled. Funny thing.

Even worst hit SE Asian nation factored population better Florida.

This less Healthcare vaccination rate. Yes, 100%, definitely. People need understand stupid dangerous anti-vax.  shitty title. vaccines still provide protection noted article.

I'd like see data comparison viral loads infected unvaccinated vs. vaccinated people - first large scale study I've seen says viral loads same. studies much smaller weird situations (gay bear week though shot one made AstraZeneca Plc still staved majority Covid infections. vaccinated people get infected delta, shown similar levels virus bodies hadn‚Äôt shots. suggests vaccinating large portions population might protect don‚Äôt get inoculated, casting doubt idea achieving herd immunity. talk percentage adults? seems like percentage total population care herd immunity, either gives us decent idea successful distribution been. think would completely wrong suggest it‚Äôs due Mexico, it‚Äôs probably even large percentage cases. using bring one MANY variables impacts transmission. way trying use gotcha, actually might find interesting, travel USA Canada. friends went embassy get countries family.

J&amp;j releasing data two dose trial next month. $$$$$ Maybe news sources, noticed many stories nurses recently. Mostly politicians.

This headline really caught attention that, makes wonder ""Why?""

Perhaps perception.

I'm softee nearly cried profusely thanking nursing student gave second vaccine shot.  Making liberal use bleach wiping bus seats, tables chairs often never gong get compliant me.

I also enjoy colds, flus stomach bugs. rec like like immuno statement.

case wise good, death wise lot better. Yeah, agree. set realistic timeline give everyone fair chance getting vaccine scheduled done. set deadline much sooner, might hard people trying get it. vaccine mandate federal employees yet? Another pointless death someone else's political agenda. kid martyr part glorious plan? followed Devil cliff, told jump. Instead, decided push daughter over. hope live this, certainly want to. Dumbasses tried use fake cards 4 5 year olds let alone - became expensive trip important points note:

- article admits data complete whether vaccines less effective severe illness/death. Given hospitalizations deaths highly vaccinated countries way lower previous waves, would appear fact so. 
- fails mention older individuals see higher waning efficacy compared younger people. ones jaw floor learn older individuals likely need boosters earlier later, eventually younger folks well. interesting see long immunity lasts 3rd dose considering time shots.
- fails mention individuals get breakthrough cases spread easily unvaccinated people others, also fails mention window infected vaccinated individual spread virus likely much smaller unvaccinated individual.

Overall, yes cautious vaccines aren‚Äôt magical pandemic ending tool right now. Many scientists (Canadians Isaac Bogoch saying months even delta) 3rd booster likely necessary, 3rd shot likely provide much longer immunity (granted, don‚Äôt yet know certain). end day, vaccines prevent severe illness long periods time even antibodies wane, that‚Äôs win.

But could wrong. Herd immunity across whole population supposedly needs 90-95% Delta variant, 810,000 4.9 million population 12 years old. Unless also vaccinate max achieve assuming adult vaccination uptake finishes 90% 74% total population vaccinated, far short 90-95% Herd immunity.

This level disease. virus better evades immunity way generate effective sterilizing immunity. It'll get little better eventually one facing first time, that's going mean much spread. 6 year olds cannot get vaccinated yet...

Small community deep south. likely accessibility issues. unvaccinated due willful choice, lack access. improving, absolutely, still concern. reporting article said, since read it. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone figure own, evidence uncovered either way, hope opinions appropriately rethought. it‚Äôs worth, there‚Äôs whole lot really specific knowledge needed understand what‚Äôs article, don‚Äôt think virologist needed.

Depends, viral-load measured *after* people report symptoms? 

If so, that's like saying: ""Among banks successfully robbed, amount money stolen even alarm system."" Well, first all, vaccine intended prevent ‚Äúinfection.‚Äù terminology distinction, important one. There‚Äôs magical force field prevents virus entering body. immunization, taught body deal swiftly. 

The hard numbers drawn need put proper context. It‚Äôs pass/fail mechanic trying quantify (there‚Äôs continuum sick people get). 

The bottom line vaccine works prevent illness exposure/infection well. Yes, less well delta variant. still well. smoke. 

My qualifications comment dig much sensationalist news organizations looking headline generate.   feels reminiscent photos came China January/February 2020.  think monoclonal therapy helpful severely ill...? Sadly, he's gonna learn anything it. Gonna get jail cocky, back country continue prick. forced change name ruling. 

The whole ""reasonable person"" bullshit hold water millions people US see network ""entertainment"" real news 5 month old fever couple days cranky, luckily okay. Possibly antibodies mom's breast milk. strange comment put article. callous.

I watch media news also (mostly Hill Rising, Breaking Points) can't imagine leaving day long, unless something huge like 9/11 something. barely manage hour, max, switch something else. It‚Äôs law Destantis announced it. can‚Äôt declare laws. anti mask ‚Äúlaw‚Äù already shot court too. thinks communist dictator something way announces dumb stuff. one listens doesn‚Äôt anything way supposed to. ""effectiveness"" measuring? infection? Symptomatic infection? Hospitalization? Everyone 12 years age? children fare OK too?  Why? Sure, UK, rates vaccination make likely almost every child's parents grandparents doses point. people infected child likely expose virus either fellow children, vaccinated adults.

**Edit:** also, considering adults UK opportunity vaccinated, remaining unvaccinated adults least likely vaccinate kids.  respond Spanish Flu way responded COVID-19. all. social media rolling lockdowns/restrictions 18 months. Maybe people extreme risk compromised immune systems expect general population. pushed two dose regiment short window shots pandemic. much longer time shot 2 3 may enough give long lasting protection variants know today. I'm fairly confident seen mutations make virus fit already. humble, stupid person opinion, likely would seen changes epitopes already possible still maintaining viable fit virus. happen?! concern, vaccination site near work, vaccinated area, empty June. Today, noticed line cars. hoping new people could third vaccines. LOL quite literally CDC guideline fully vaccinated individuals safe public though still need mask up. joke lmfao people live different planet. I'm convinced. think burden making ""is safe thing do?"" choice going get fucking groceries mentally exhausting month month. restrictions mean social aspect dictates way feel. really great others susceptible fear-mongering headlines let case numbers cancelations bother them, based sub see elsewhere, represent majority. Security theater land jail, say almost leaving kid locked car summer heat.

Smacks entitlement. Here‚Äôs couple live Miami Beach. They‚Äôve got miles beaches explore play on, Keys beautiful drive away. But, yeah, middle pandemic decide go Hawaii.

I realize somehow missed fact vaccine cards obviously young children would tip-off, could miss strict Hawaii been? they‚Äôre stupid attempted pull off, completely underestimated diligently authorities would jobs. They‚Äôre stupid raising next generation. Yeah damage caused real shame, I've come see recent wave ripping sticking plaster ways. probably sounds callous, mean to, know better word it.

I've seen said everyone Earth likely get covid point life, far better first time vaccination. think age-based approach UK took vaccination year good idea due fact - people exposed summer least likely suffer serious consequences, seems gotten us final bump. 

Obviously, remains seen, I'm optimistic UK shows sufficient vaccination, combined increased immunity prior infection, enough get life without covid crippling society. sincerely hope US far away too, I've worked travelled lot look forward future.

Remember numbers China reported fit perfect curve predicted advance release.  assume they‚Äôre providing virtual
School option quarantinedv Thanks - insinuating lying (but aren't. like said - combination real world studies pre-prints abound) - turns we're talking different endpoints.

Obviously completely avoiding infection goal, reducing symptoms (and therefore viral load), well ultimately hospitalization death seem well-sustained.

Cases still elevated levels theory that‚Äôs bandied correct, UK may entering endemic period may hit either winter winter Case counts every country definitely undercounting actual number infections. much depends country, probably least half, probably more.

UK example, official cases England: 5.5 million (source: Reasonable estimate modelling based available data: 16 million plus (source: still need think new variants effects vaccines. long term illness, can't look what's happening now. People risk group expect vaccinated every months. Yeah, eastern Washington able pull Idaho pretty easily considering poorly Idaho pays treats teachers. Yesterday first time I‚Äôve indoor shopping mall long time surprised people masks on. Vast majority maskless. Okay, seem saying fact people get vaccines easily US, means offering boosters US affect ability people countries get vaccines. sound logic all.

There countries vaccination slowed lack supply. US could send vaccines countries. Would giving boosters US actually enable US help countries vaccine supply we're now? know answer. certainly possible. also possible things US help countries would effective vaccinating people quickly, giving boosters would make meaningful difference. think simple question - needs answered people much knowledgeable I.

But one thing absolutely certain: mere fact vaccines easily available US - doses available eligible people want - give answer question. might, example, mean could send (or redirect production) lot spare doses countries since we're using much access to. worry misleading nature headline. could imply vaccination helping important thing. (or both) Correct still believe lower Oh yeah man, think that's positive shift work-life balance hope revert suddenly anyway. feels like that's shift workplace culture rather due pandemic-specific concerns moment lot workplaces.

I lot friends tech almost employers downgraded offices realise much cheaper, employees happy productive home, can't see going back that. Good thing London least easy still maintain social culture organising pints time time, maybe proper social event quarter. You‚Äôre little low Rally traffic count hits  disagree assessment. 

I clear first post. think /u/sonofagunn's original point correct. trying say think full picture.

I'm sure from, live red state tell talking friends neighbors, (but all) fall category ""willful ignorance"". 

They heard evidence; choose believe it. rabid consumers Fox News (or worse) despite fact many Fox personalities pro-vaccine (even Hannity pro-vaxx), ignore favor 1-2 prominent assholes not. people basically contrarians going resist anything ""they"" say.

In lot respects, unified message make people dig more. Universal agreement sign bigger conspiracy people many kid deaths age 12 been? ICU hospitalizations old enough vaccinated. Isn‚Äôt *going* case (in countries vaccination rates high) majority cases deaths *will* vaccinated folk? also worth noting due way Covid deaths counted UK, long virus circulating always ""Covid deaths"" even none people actually died Covid 

I think that's almost countries count otherwise really difficult say died covid something else reporting deaths becomes real headache. little misleading, includes several months vaccine widely available. inflates unvaccinated numbers. better graph would last 3 months.  find sucking candy like starburst helps. sugar + increased saliva benefit. AP Reuters go-to. Big name news papers also fair share investigative work, ABC/NBC/CBS/CNN/Fox essentially TV production crews copy/paste stuff AP.  Yet another dissonant logic: protesters agains vaccines complained tear gas laced virus? what? don‚Äôt need vaccine anyway. one gets sick say ‚Äúsee, don‚Äôt need vaccine‚Äù get sick, blame police .

Biggest problem loss efficacy still debatable, believes waiting vaccines prioritized healthy people rich countries getting potentially unnecessary third shot.  could barely get half country take first round, bet booster uptake fraction that. nice work ireland! Thank responsible citizen that‚Äôs grief works.

First there‚Äôs initial shock, comes pain people wonder could done differently, that‚Äôs shift blame away community care takers first responders.

They must done job right. really want challenge trials one seems them. would useful data showing whether people immune not.

There ethical issues vaccinated people risk low. This! mild flu, cold, indigestion etc. EUA 12's expected within 45-60 days  
full FDA stamp 12's within 90 days ratio cases hospitalisations going better even June peak we've vaccinated many 20-30 year olds since then, really big part hospital numbers peak. significant part current rise new see reflected hospital stats yet. type mindset towards public policy results nobody taking anything seriously anymore

a drastically reduced amount deaths compared previous norm very, preferable  Yes. 100% vaccination rate, every death, every hospitalization technically vaccinated person. 100% vaccination rate deaths hospitalizations also low. going matter \*lot\* you, get infected.

In fact, may already happened notice. nothing significant happened. vaccinated. researches find cure treatment covid patients?

Your question make sense.  originally wrote opposite: ""Masks need kids school needs done school""

They're another sad troll turns out. Hope get better mate! I'm willing wager everyone's general immunity illnesses all-time low 18 months reduced social contact, bet there's sorts shit going round.

With regards spike, pessimistic me, we'll see guess! spike reopening leading real doomsday predictions media, all, sort of...fell flat? We've given nearly 90% adults least one dose vaccine, double jabbed coming weeks. We're opening 16 &amp; 17 year olds week. I'm sure needs done point really! SARS kill rate what, 10%?

Opinion comment: one feels like they‚Äôre taking crazy pills seeing universities forge ahead in-person classes, social distancing, without even mask requirements? feel like it‚Äôs virtually certainty we‚Äôll going back online. surprises *all* universities page this, would expected least couple go online now. terrifying data. 

But symptoms means got infected replicated nose upper tract, case. That's basically goal want immune system recognize it. live next concert event place leave every day over. driving work; hospital nurse. 

I get stopped traffic cop everyone gets wave make turn towards freeway.

Most time first line 1015 pm see filled cars people packed would mostly guess friends. makes cringe know much time going offered take. lot kids even back yet North East later month. almost definitely gonna get worse. Yay. Easy fix. Offer competitive salary + bonuses people actually want work madness.

Act like there's pandemic start masking, vaccinating, etc. stop reduce. Like seatbelts stop death car accidents reduce it.

However fair argument debate pros cons home schooling vs attending school covid rampant.

I think possible say 100% certainty either option best approach probably wont clear right choices years later.

All say certainty eligible adults got vaccinated would reduce risk children substantially due number reasons:

* Transmission outside school settings would reduced therefore less infection general less frequency outbreaks schools
* Hospitals emergency services would much larger capacity provide best level care children severe symptoms

Regarding vaccine FDA not, really bit non issue right considering 32% world (4.84 billion doses) already received least one dose vaccine, holding taking vaccine please take moment consider angles topic, please consider risk vs reward is?

* What's risk getting vaccine? High, chance hurting others, directly indirectly putting much strain health services.
* What's risk getting vaccine? Low, mostly loosing face anyone social circle pride real risk? 32% world (**4.84 billion doses)** already received least one vaccine, really, honestly, believe still anything gain holding out?

Anyway good luck anyone fence vaccine hope take moment consider this. old data? 6k deaths 2021? There's 275k deaths attributed covid far year U.S. school‚Äôs former band director lost battle COVID weeks ago. wife also died virus days later.

U-S-A! Wait 3rd shot help saying better use extra vaccines vaccinate people? I'm imagining dark timeline Culp lmao I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre intelligent enough grasp concept ‚Äúfluid situation.‚Äù pandemic fluid, evolving situation worldwide scale. 

The original strains less virulent children, average. Delta seemingly changing that. 

I‚Äôm sure understand overwhelming desire try semantic way making untrue.  I'm torn do. 2x Pfizer would love Moderna effective, lack safety data things like I'm hesitant. definitely many people getting antibiotics feed store.

Because doctor provider can't fucking afford one! public health officials could acknowledge reality while... Completely agree. It‚Äôs embarrassing Texan. anti vaxxers/anti maskers loud make seem like everyone state ignorant. see Trump won/no bullshit/confederate flags etc. backs ridiculous lifted trucks multiple times, every day. Wearing mask certain draw looks/comments would honestly scared put sticker wear shirt said anything Biden vaccinated. I‚Äôve watched people get COVID experience breathing issues etc month month later they‚Äôre asking would get vaccinated it‚Äôs flu. It‚Äôs like get caught bullshit forget experience. Mind blowing. Every state health department data.

The problem need numbers since mid-July (and possibly separated age bracket) get handle delta waning antibodies. Education first. Can't understand that. We're literally top 50 smartest states.

Source: /s that's even needed point. I'm fed up. options here. work, there's help state enable us stay home care kids. send kids school, schools can't even bothered mask policy enforce social distancing. Feels like we're never ending spiral feasible way out. short 7 day lockdown would probably effective reducing case numbers drastically though, vaccination rates high, might better long term.

I see political anything like moment, think there's least logical argument it. honestly believe Tom Hanks died got thousands people would alive today. Instead got better went SNL. know trying reassure people think backfired. first bit data people needed start going the, ""Oh, bad. worse flu."" line thinking. get hospitalization rates article. said actually disproportionally hitting vaccinated areas.

One hard city hit Modiin 90% vaccination rate.

They said right vaccine 39% effective, number officially confirmed.

There also ominous line, ""The vaccine still believed help prevent severe illness become infected, though Israeli data suggests possibility increased risk severe disease among received early vaccinations.""

Sounds like vaccine wanes fairly fast, especially fighting variants. always say base data ‚Äúnow‚Äù. However, real life doesn‚Äôt translate. example, two months ago said don‚Äôt need boosters based ‚Äúthe data had‚Äù, ignoring high probability delta variant would mess up. Despite reports India etc. It‚Äôs frustrating. guess don‚Äôt want speculate, end makes look dumb hurts public confidence. Good, hope gets what‚Äôs coming him. mean? I'm saying like everything peachy around world. New Zealand Australia keep continuing go lockdowns 8 new cases. wife vegas work february, almost went thought, nah save money. 
I still regret it. Texas Florida show clear peak R recently

Until positivity starts dropping, really hard say that. 20% positivity rate tests easy come by, really know peaked. 

Also, mean peak R? R peaked (not cases), still probably looking good amount time cases coming down.   problem straight extrapolation like that, works assume number vaccinated equal, else same.

If 100 cases country 100% vaccination rate, can't say 2 vaccinated. already know every single one vaccinated. 44 year old booked one tomorrow morning. understand ""what countries getting gear yet"", sad, also whataboutism reason individual countries try best. flat wrong. Vaccines prevent transmission virus transmitted get chance mutate. Meanwhile unvaccinated making walking coronavirus petri dishes. morgue. conservative news outlets-- pretty much every GOP higher government vaccinated.  might say (claiming privacy whatnot) mostly want seem like ***the fucking hypocrites are*** constituents. ""But AMERICANS, blah blah blah."" wish could communicated point concisely. It‚Äôs always money. indeed look like need eventually though, corporations really rammed early. guess America pays countries wasn‚Äôt attractive solve problem right away.

Maybe I'm bad person that, someone *offered* mask I'm walking somewhere I'm going say no. Just... yeah. thus I'm tempted go grab Pfizer dose instead waiting around forever ""official guidance."" September 30th. doctor, clearly. 

Once arrived hospital severe COVID, little difference survival rates vaccinated unvaccinated.

The vaccinated, vast majority, never progress stage kind triage would apply. do, vaccination status would appropriate include indicative. hospitalized also somewhat negative effect educational process. It‚Äôs reckless send kids young vaccinated high risk environments, like schools without mask/vax mandates.

Also please get ticket state?  do. also go lot random people's homes part job (real estate appraisal).

And went Disneyland completely packed people‚Ä¶. reason making vaccine targeting SARS would better vaccine targeting combination Delta, Gamma, Lambda? 

Easy fix: Draw legislation include Pandemic Vaccination Credit gives tax payers tax credits completed innoculations eligible age groups. Continue following years boosters Covid eradicated. addition blood donation covid antibodies get tax credits.

Reward desired behavior. that's medicine works. Doctors treat everyone. war, enemy soldiers get medical care ""home team"" gets. actually illegal - crime humanity - otherwise. goes prisoners convicted heinous crimes, etc.

Non-discrimination basis political, religious, plain old stupidity views actions fundamental medical ethics. ‚ÄúMight need‚Äù means ‚Äúmight need.‚Äù yet another EXCELLENT reason get vaccinated. Cancer patients displaced unvaccinated Covid patients. Cancer patients often everything get by, treatments can't wait. sucks come far. businesses arbitrarily designating essential people thinking masks vaccines conspiracies take away free thought. United States whole held profit life. good amount people decided cause effect meant nothing inconvenience tyranny. feels exhausting done right thing nothing got better. believe that‚Äôs case. doesn‚Äôt fit narrative though.  false. large populations people vaccinated virus still transmits them, perfect evolutionary training ground virus. vaccinated person could give rise new strain found way trick immune system thus make vaccines useless. known evolutionary jump possible virus likely is, sure say likely happen vaccinated unvaccinated people. simple filtering logic. unvaccinated contribute problem spreading higher viral loads general, mutation likely happen vaccinated people.

Most us want another illness come back haunt us old weak make us die horrible death. That's one does, variants eventually mutate avoid vaccines, could trouble. Especially becomes likely cause death.

Like others said, trying get turn get away (e.g. time woods/beach/somewhere TV easily available) help. talking fears values finding common ground - way, they're primed information instead shutting down. still unlikely easy quick though; wish best. Ope. Well. Full face respirator Lmao Bleak, sounds accurate me.

I hard time talking even pro-vaccine mask people this. Pandemic fatigue bewitch brain, sure, thinking time we've devoted mitigation, waste let go we're sick it. *Everyone's* sick it.  Fingers crossed false alarm! ü§û 95% antibodies. 70% adults UK least one vaccine dose, 29% unvaccinated population contributing 60% hospitalizations. came NYC, house prices downright steal comparatively. 8 months? happens want get sooner? see 4 months decline mark. Rt values across country decreasing, many 1. Hopefully get better soon. Portugal got faster because: 1)vaccination certificate used 'requirement' stuff even young people want vaccinated, 2) last weeks young males (18-50) almost got Janssen vaccines save Pfizer vaccines women children,so young males 14 days one dose fully vaccinated 3) Portugal average health care system speaking conditions human resources, far less ICU beds per 100.000 citizens comparing Germany, people worried health care system accepts vaccine far easily, excluding exceptions believe people countries less resources poorer health care systems accepts vaccines far easily.   There...uh...isn't going final wave. SARS-COV-2 endemic human populations now. There's zero chance ever going away, gonna fresh wave every winter on. settle long-term immunity like coronaviruses people dying, we're going catching covid forever. ""Case wise"" Covid-Forever people always going about. madness islands (NZ Australia), world acknowledged unless kill quietly homes, antibodies positives rise, mostly harmlessly, hard-won combination vaccinations asymptomatic exposures works way out. database implemented eliminate fake cards problem, otherwise doubt many people money pay doctors doctors like job.  already put trial get ass locked prison?

Note: know, he's supposed trial multiple felonies going back 2015 still never happened.  Please don‚Äôt put universe, lol.  Fuck yeah. hate trump. Antivaxxers making worse. getting stronger MF hurting innocent people.  PANDEMIC

It would US guts shut international interstate travel. QUESTION: wait 8 months sooner? Data shows 4 months decline. evidence overstimulating immune system crash immune system? personally know two changed minds. One hospitalized friend vent. Going lot sad wake calls year think. Yeah, that's usually works. sarcastic? Holy shit. options place, summer. Maybe able get vaccine medical reasons I'm blaming family, there's state sponsored vaccination site Raleigh, MS (Smith County Health Dept). NPR also episode COVID base rate fallacy, interviewed several experts publishing it. It‚Äôs probably ranking high it‚Äôs hot topic right now. I'm interested, fully placated... article admits data used Feb year, padded time writing (early July) notation data Delta variant expected change conclusion, think bit cautious skepticism still warranted face Delta spinoff strains interest. Oh lol thought implying vaccine cause blood clot  Haha lot people made covid personalities past 18 months going real bereavement world moves coming months. Went local shopping centre today. Masks aren‚Äôt mandatory strongly advised. 500 people saw 45 masks on.  Covid infection. can‚Äôt really think anything else would cause sudden death like  knew J&amp;J less effective overall, 1 shot vaccine convenient. scammed? Age *Mis*Information

FTFY someone dies vaccine say healthy? 

Or different? Wrong island, unfortunately. Basically waiting data. assume eventually recommended. another J&amp;J shot booster Although Dr. Barouch said could predict kind booster federal officials might ultimately recommend people gotten Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, data expects released soon studies two doses Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, rather mRNA Indeed, Dr. Moore anticipated government recommended booster near future people received Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, would second dose vaccine. ‚ÄúThere won‚Äôt data J.&amp;J. first, mRNA second,‚Äù said. what? Where. Are. bodies? want closure sister Garth.  ""seems indicate"" much loose way stating prediction. schools west coast even started yet year. Time obviously give one side argument confirmation. I'm hoping right, I'd put money prediction.

Either way though, current proposition still gambling health child. thanks. possibly get dumber? Outdoor festivals major vectors, especially level jabs &amp; population antibodies.

385,000 people attended biggest music festival since Covid (Lollapalooza Chicago) \~200 positives two weeks later. far ahead vaccinations. think putting individual case (you believe got generic ""respiratory infection"" attending event) numbers argue strongly outdoor festivals mostly vaccinated attendees simply ""superspreaders."" like 40ish percent. vaccination rate sky rocketed last months due large part companies vaccinating employees there's still way go lot hesitant people. race chances win, tripped, fell broke ankle. hope government protect anti-vaxxers longer restrictions lockdowns, etc. Anybody thread unrealistic right lying efficacy vaccinations causing harm good. completely fine vacines 70% effective, lying pretending 99.9% effective fuel conspiracy nuts truth comes out.

Dont blinded love pro vaccine side actually hurt cause. need cheer leader isnt important lives vaccines save. Ooooh, don‚Äôt see how, read way, means conveys something. racism intended. apologize. Really wish people India well. someone vaccine dies, hand waive away ""some kind genetic vulnerability undiagnosed medical condition""

Or different?  RemindMe! 2 weeks ‚ÄúRemind 2 weeks‚Äù people like enable predators Please simply use good respirators gas masks everyone stop creating dangerous variants.


Respirators prevent virus intake (and shedding, depending usage) without delay. highly efficient reliable proper training, neglected health authorities doctors, somehow...


Respirators protecting HCWs vaccines. protect HCWs general public regardless vaccination status. Sounds like Texas Dumb. Literally Chernobyl event Vastly under/no reporting. imagine, hospitals already nearing capacity...schools went back either little basic mask mandates place. Garth Brooks canceled concert tour last weekend largest turnout ever 95,000 fans packed Memorial Stadium (no masks vax required). 

Douglas County (Omaha Metro) Lancaster County (Lincoln Metro) two numbers state watch. local health departments keeping daily tracks cases, deaths, vaccinations counties (as far currently know). 

Those counties also majority state's ICU capacity (most rural patients state would essentially transferred there), full overcapacity know remaining majority state at. Also, cities highest vaccination rates so, again, cases start rising rural counties 30 40% vaccination rates probably pretty deep. teachers 19 years old didnt work him...

She knew exactly getting her.  Oh sure, keep useless work...

Today, I‚Äôm two people like them. Quit wasting time. Help get way. true. I‚Äôd happy 95%+. Given finding antibodies animals I‚Äôm sure able avoid mutations either. don‚Äôt know answers know get something effective.   many present fake cards pay doctors lie? nothing ""high horse"" lamenting trivialization 350 preventable deaths. challenge say faces 350 families live this, whether faults not.

Give fucking break. saying breakthrough infection, likelihood severe case scores lower someone get vaccinated. case woman's husband, monoclonal antibodies might tad overkill 7 day average getting close peak cases, pre-vaccine. someone local story says numbers wrong, check obviously familiar situation am. Lol.
Obviously mistakes happen articles Covid numbers.  matter says title. states ""Roughly 80.7% England‚Äôs population fully vaccinated"". untrue leads people ask questions figures still high ""80.7% population vaccinated.""

It's incorrect statement author correct article people make assumptions may may meant say. sure. truth. 18 month old rsv. kids sick last month. Probably passing back forth. It‚Äôs crazy month.  True think it‚Äôs optimistic say flu. think it‚Äôs likely people get yearly vaccination little risk flu. Louder, people Every single adult charge making sure safe, failed. I'm seriously getting anxious I'm tempted go get Pfizer. mean that? really making distinction public-health wise previously infected unvaccinated... instance, recommendation everyone get vaccinated, even previously infected.

Red = unvaccinated, green = vaccinated. lesser covs =/= sars sars 2

Those coronaviruses life threatening novel body responds accordingly. reason SARS still provides t-cells 17 years later. volume patients state operated facility doubled yesterday

Holy fuck. Hopefully number people Covid doubbled. would be, eh, bad. said somewhere else someone GA got J&amp;J I'm tempted go back get Pfizer. feel fucking scammed considering bad Delta got. Maybe I'm piece shit feeling I'd rather ride ""shitty poor people vaccine"" ya know? Several lifetimes wage slave.  Yea, every state around Colorado relies Colorado health infrastructure. Monoclonal antibodies useful body already built antibodies, meaning groups actually useful are:

* Immunosuppressed 
* Vaccine medical exemptions
* Extremely elderly
* Children can't vaccinated yet (is monoclonal approved children? I'm sure)
* Unvaccinated people 

For antibodies vaccine prior infection, much. priority getting monoclonal antibodies groups needed, yes even antivaxxers, keeping people emergency level care keep ICUs lower capacity, helping groups care (immunosuppressed, elderly, exempt, children) get better care eventually need it. mention people need surgeries care able get right now. worry. He's *walking* public much either.   Iirc vaccine req already given NYC. not, call public health office That‚Äôs prejudice  read mostly disagree it. Literally need ""stay top"" COVID get everyone vaccinated get vaccines approved ages. Everything else provides marginal help best incredibly diminishing returns. demand people isolate weeks end? happening contact tracing UK ‚Äúpingdemic ?‚Äù early days, took steps flatten curve hospitals would overwhelmed. Hospitals overwhelmed cases higher they‚Äôve ever don‚Äôt understand aren‚Äôt taking steps flatten curve like before. thought curve flattened enough keep hospitals overwhelmed back then, effort seemed positive affect. haven‚Äôt heard anyone say word idea time around. haven‚Äôt even heard anyone say didn‚Äôt work we‚Äôre gonna try again.  uhh school virtual beds sick children. Dear god happen.   Letters clergy written doctrine going hit non Christian religions, especially folk religions.

Also mathematician point cannot prove negative (and you? possible change religious beliefs).

And no, fully vacinated. I‚Äôll take natural immunity nothing- it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs worthless. Would let someone previously infected vaccinated green pass? No. Would plan public health-wise based amount people infected? Yes, already been. went phish AC weekend 40k ppl i‚Äôm fine. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è cant scared forever yall   Good. SHOW PEOPLE.

Signed, pissed Floridian. Added edit genuinely appreciate comment. want people go data takes them. hate seeing panic information spread. One hope much better job communicating information better future. also comes women‚Äôs bodies choices sounds like hunch solid evidence. stories pediatric hospitals weeks change, plus states without massive pediatric surges (due high adult vaccination rates), go virtual? south clusterfuck, state (NY) well peaks last two surges.

We sort thing Nazis. Holy shit nothing would good enough y‚Äôall ü§ß sarcastic. made great point seems like opposite point trying make lol. feels like weeks/months away Wuhan disaster cities/states get high horse assuming comorbidity? 

I, (a nurse seen virus firsthand) sick people downplaying shrugging shoulders child dies ""oh well 350 died"". 

As far accusing ""high horse"" .....after fellow nurses faced pandemic, think high horse, well goddamn earned it. 

 Perhaps virus taken little bit seriously death rates downplayed ""only"" assumptions continuously made ""they comorbidity "" mess begin with. true. you‚Äôre referring really responsible adults population. still half population thinks it‚Äôs hoax overblown.  Hopefully FL businesses realized country going pandemic (even never shutdown), preparing curbside takeout orders keep business up. gonna see massive drop revenue. talking along lines symptoms transmission. clarified :) Alabama got ""the people Alabama common sense they'll use it.""

Governor MeeMaw incorrect. Yep, reason cancelled Canada part trip Glacier/Waterton. logistics difficult. would've take several hours drive to/from nearest big town get PCR test, hope actually able get test (the local health department informed us weeks prior spiking cases locations running tests), hope results came back time, hope false positive, hope get flat tire something would delay us past 72 hour window. went wrong, we'd late get refund hotel.

But yeah, solution cancel instead committing fraud hoping border agents would stupid notice 8 year old possibly vaccinated.

Edit: yes, find clinic offering 4-12 hour guaranteed turnaround time, paying $225 x 4 (not covered insurance) testing question. Yeah mean it‚Äôs unlike someone comes hospital symptomatic rabies. point it‚Äôs pretty much certainty you‚Äôre gonna die it‚Äôs like hospital doesn‚Äôt try save you‚Ä¶.

I think (in US) don‚Äôt really accept hospital system ‚Äúlol you‚Äôre screwed please go tent die‚Äù triage. I‚Äôve grown second world country that. one gets circled around lot, realistically US Supreme court changes opinion, even supposed to. Brown vs Board education first ruling subject.

I would like see something recent. ‚Äúnegative‚Äù unvaccinated positive side vaccinated? you‚Äôre saying people everything right got sick anyway don‚Äôt deserve treatment, intentionally everything wrong got sick result deserve treatment. Got it. Also treatment effective people become seriously ill, after. Thinking bout half comments daily thread like May/June ‚Äújust got vaccine, pandemic me, unsubbing, bye‚Äù. only. Data place. trend towards ""slightly less."" I'm NZ family there, surreal see discourse outside perspective. government talking cautiously reopening borders, whilst also stating going elimination ""indefinitely"". me, elimination pre-pandemic borders mutually exclusive goals, conversation NZ realistic stuck March 2020.

I think (hope) discourse going start shifting rest world finds stable balance vaccination allows require lockdowns live freely. Lockdowns handful cases stubbornly retain elimination massive drag. 

FWIW, article first shift I've started see government narrative challenged ultimately scientifically unrealistic - think government know that, went extremely hard Zero Covid costs rhetoric, including harsh criticism UK reopening. played well far, population scared compliance, deaths kept low, Labour party landslide back it. trouble think they've somewhat painted corner politically backtrack rhetoric coming months. virtual deadline.   area article children's hopspitals ERs filling up, article went say RSV contributing spike COVID (at least now...)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: colorado  School even started Miami yet. even close over. considerable amount people US 50 yet still bother get vaccinated whereas like 95% 50s got near 99% 70s.

Id imagine vast majority UK deaths vaccinated people Yeah feel terrible too. don‚Äôt like wearing masks 100% believe everyone school time, vaccines get approved 12 younger. It‚Äôs shocking see photos you‚Äôre right cognitive dissonance runs deep I've heard ICU beds pretty limited Mississippi...I'm sure good use one them. Yes, trackers update old data media focused todays data. probably pure showing progress pandemic sensible record people actually died paperwork went through, going create communication issues take. school district right next school work at. I'm reading Instagram comments anti-vaxers hilarious. say going pull kids yada yada yada. even live district, tiny! Can't wait norm. Indoor beaches? solid reminder Yeah. Traveling Africa entering grocery store. thing trust local authorities make right decisions, simply places need mask won't. area 100% adult vax rate may believe need mask mandate schools (they'd probably wrong, least they're thinking logic). said, either governors/legislatures mandate masks schools, let local districts decide. We're latter Indiana, school districts started year masks. Others quickly followed case numbers made last year look laughable. position makes little sense view actual scientists saying. nuance, thought future changes. Punishment? Bizarre. Fixed Yeh one number way bigger normal countries. don‚Äôt get it. 94% antibodies (I don‚Äôt know exactly many 1 shot), virus spread like that? 20k cases day seems pretty much high percentage. know vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean immune getting sick won‚Äôt likely kill you. politicians Germany making decisions amount cases day, want small. need understand actions impact others.

Good luck this. entire population you-know-whos couldnt care less.  returning classrooms full unvaccinated children refuse mask. They'll fine. kids may end breakthrough cases, especially since they'd likely asymptomatic. There's way model includes public universities going back without masks. UF starts Monday. Yes? 

""Vaccines prevent infection"" 

""plenty vaccinated people still getting covid""

I think understand infection means. means getting covid. So, jackpot! infection still high rate long term complications

No, doesn't.   express percentage total population group, otherwise someone take face value spread mis-information wearing respirators masks times take getting used to?

It did. Ultimate FX respirator designed comfort, full-face respirators, cover one's eyes well one's nose, generally comfortable half-face press sensitive areas right around one's nose mouth. 

But half-face respirator wear home bother first started using extended time. wear think anything it. actually prefer full-face respirator, feel clearer mentally whatever reason wearing it. easier people understand wearing half-face respirator. surgical mask started feel like pants me-I feel naked public wearing it, sure ready tear hot day.

A respirator like Ultimate FX 3M 7502 (half- face)
would likely comfortable. get hot inside, partly different valves inhaling exhaling. designed industrial workers, wear hours. work wearing respirator find uncomfortable. reports break throughs sound like bad flu would expect going new upper respiratory virus.

It sounds like going new influenza. sucks. Influenza deadly driving do. make influenza go away, one thing top.  I'd like little bit data clarity like ages ""children"", pre-existing conditions, many Dallas hospitalized. assume 1900 children hospitalized national statistic cumulative since pandemic started but, sure. Concerted effort politicize plague political party gain amongst ignorant cult members misinformation cannon Facebook/social media used enemies idiots sew discord kill Americans. last year huge wake call truly American exceptionalism is. country greedy idiots lemming way fall country knew it. daily average decent chunk less since report many weekend. Sitting around 80 mark 40% heard bringing back razr probably end next, phone decade ago country matters /s Yes, close it. guess good metric give would *ratio* vaccinated unvaccinated deaths, along straight percentage. ""See, liver cirrhosis got alcohol abuse that's killing me. lung cancer got smoking. Therefore alcohol abuse thing!""  Mitigating factors lot less think. We‚Äôve seen time time real world examples. Unless completely lock everything, ebb flow cases tend look similar regardless mitigating factors. wonder new variant bringing back them? Look India whole thing started. cases deaths declining since got peak. Eventually enough people become naturally immune variant. likely take another different variant cause another surge. would depend parents. that's irrelevant teachers still escalating risk level selfishly. meet more. None us shy going office get job done. Working home nice, always effective get paid effective. vaccinated? numbers basically backdated handle reporting. Surely 80% adult population right think realized defined right. thinking R&amp;D across companies, government sunk purchasing masks (hence billions) 

Then there's per unit cost (what presented) there's customer pays.

Recipients paid upfront vaccines, upfront cost $0. Masks, hand, buy. depending buy many vary cost, own, day, 3 reusable masks, probably paying $15-$30. front cost more. However, back end sure cost producing masks much, much cheaper vaccines (although masks vary greatly material cost varies) It‚Äôs even law. It‚Äôs random declaration. Desantis doesn‚Äôt even use power properly. big declarations get shot minute challenged aren‚Äôt even anything. courts consistently ruled dumb Covid declarations. hope works guys!  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I'd say no, since probability dying fully vaccinated extremely low. Probably less 0.1%, unvaccinated die higher rates (up 1-10% depending age illnesses) distinguish PTSD proposed long covid need large scale data PTSD effects reasons requiring ICU treatment, would need comparable ie ventilator use etc. already database somewhere would need gathered outside national emergency. would take time future.

We also still pandemic need keep gathering data see symptom presentation changes time, comparison mental illness brought traumatic situations and, general, chart changes time lockdowns, increases fear changes news optimism variables. 

We also need time see what's left whether be, suspect, general post-viral illness presentation non-specific particular coronavirus.

So, ignored lockdowns, mask-mandates, didn‚Äôt get vaccinated, get trot right front line hospitals worked hard keep check? take advantage medical workers? Yep, dad air ambulance pilot. Frequently flew kids Montana Wyoming location. mean unvaccinated? depends high. 

2% unvaccinated people vs 0.01% vaccinated people balances ~99.5% vaccination. Though that's count anyone already infected.  remember smoking banned places like shopping malls late 80/ early 90 also remember smoking restaurants around 2005. Blows mind restaurants took long follow suit. many people cite CDC‚Äôs apparently flip flopping (or statements like - don‚Äôt need annual ones, say year say do) covid opinions. people lack critical thinking realize, apparently, new virus experts constantly learning guidelines thoughts may change. one smart enough see this, many others. Sadly whole lot others aren‚Äôt lose trust government says covid - view flip flopping statements like anything ‚Äúit‚Äôs new virus, don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôre learning.‚Äù conclusion, yeah, CDC better, realizing people fucking stupid take one statement heart life.

We another wave, cases going highest levels we've ever seen (although UK wide cases peaked peaked January).

But cases mostly younger unvaccinated people, deaths hospitalizations rise anywhere near much previous waves. However still rise quite bit, hospitals came lot pressure little while. 

Things calmed down, unfortunately cases rising they've really skyrocketed past days again. reported 3,000 new cases today, double last Thursday fifth highest day ever.

Schools Scotland went back week, could playing part. might also early us even seeing effect that, worry itself. 

Its looking like vaccinations end pandemic. They'll get us point live virus without hospitals collapse. still going stick around kill lot people. wanting bring politics better divide sane vs insane states It‚Äôs difficult tell protective vaccine infection really need challenge trial *deliberately* try infect know definitely exposed. imagine trials difficult though happening. original clinical trials try find parts world cases high could get useful results. think read research estimates Pfizer 50% efficacy asymptomatic infection? what's end game long take steps it, never really seen spelled out. 

The reason never see end-game spelled (by actual scientists, least) one knows exactly virus going do. 

We assume - near absolute certainty - SARS-CoV-2 going continue mutate. 

And - extent - reasonably assume new strain displaces delta variant adapted hosts available time. 

We also reasonably assume longer allowed spread unchecked population opportunity adapt manner beneficial virus.

We make assumptions things viruses large known do, indeed we've already seen SARS-CoV-2 this.

But can't know turn less-problematic strain that's highly contagious mild, highly contagious worse, vaccine buster (this keeps epidemiologists know night), thousand variations theme.

This shot basically next variant Delta. I'm trying answer questions seem clear answers. I've tried find many credible resources possible these, anything helpful.

It's misleading say get covid vaccine chances dying covid19 almost nothing. Thats simply fact...

Because talking breakthrough cases relative vacuum. 70-90% fact accurate numbers. However, we're talking small percentage symptomatic breakthrough cases. ~25% people still catch get sniffles even notice still become vector pass someone else. people obviously dont report hospital. That's numbers radically different. Also talking 1% either. actual number fraction single percent.

I see coming from, businesses shuttering favor WFH means fewer office workers grabbing coffee, lunch, etc work, meaning less income (particularly urban) businesses depend office worker market. 

But towns people commuting from? towns slowly turned mostly bedroom communities shoppers working nearest city? Now, many WFH office workers expendable income commute since they'll city less, convenience dictates they'll spend locally. People time less stress day visit local restaurants join social clubs, time get involved town barely lived commutes urban-centric jobs. 

This going shutter communities, going *save* them. people work retail/food service jobs city can't afford live downtown! revitalize suburban/subrural towns they're already living in, decentralizing wealth that's currently held cities.

The original idea position exempt overtime rules would apply handful executive highly independent professional positions. type positions expected work independently highly self-directing. decades, degree requirements expanded line professional hourly employees blurred. 

I think work-from-home would excellent litmus test determine positions level independence necessary qualify overtime exempt. require employees physically office? Well, core part duties involves present set number hours. let employees work home, micro-manage hourly tracking software? degree independence professionalism necessary qualify overtime exempt. Pay time-and-a-half pay deserve, including time spent responding emails hours. 

Originally overtime exempt meant apply executives highly self-directing, professional professions. Think type job business purposes weeks might office 70 hours. weeks might office 20 hours taking clients lunch golf outings. salaried position pay comes commissions. 

Now millions workers work offices qualify overtime, even though little independence control work time process. difficult create clear rules distinguish various office-type positions, thus overtime exempt positions grown relentlessly decades.

you're less likely hospitalized die ... come across someone whose okay infecting others long social life Haha got done playing lincoln,NE 91,000 people BOOM! care healthy body take health granted. never good self medicate...trust doctors spent entire lives studying this...there's answer NPI's people vaccinated measles.

This quite true: aggressively contact trace measles outbreaks. They're really rare, much impact people's lives. always felt like Brooks going 'I music want get out! fanbase expects hardcore country singer on. roleplay second identity, maybe release poppy, rock-oriented songs without anyone going crazy?""

Then people went bugfuck nuts. Either people getting vaccinated they're screwing death numbers. AI AI AIII Maybe guys fans would start following proto wouldn‚Äôt cancel tour. TELL US FUCKING BODIES BURIED G! Nice man thanks hosting super spreader event town calling Actually, so-called ""Russian flu"" swept Europe 1880s certainly noticed virulence lethality. can't certain OC43, quite likely. ..What? Much 10% country contracted covid - extrapolate CDC's estimate May (120M infection, 37% country) many cases we've since, get 48% country infected. can't add together, since many people infected vaccinated (or vaccinated infected), they're mixed evenly, come estimate 75% country vaccinated, infected, both. course factor waning immunity time 75% level immunity, point large portion population least good degree immunity. maintained opinion attempts fail. Case numbers probably even reported anymore, dependent testing infrastructure likelihood people get tested. Hospitalizations probably best metric see well doing, UK still OK regard. great, OK. way? interesting. I've working Citrix products since 1998 made really secure. nice without knowledge situation reality jumped tight conclusion. Nice. daughter turns 16 next week. Since gov said 16 17 year olds get vaccine. She‚Äôll so, wants younger ones. It‚Äôs responsibility have. I'm home possible, look Russian flu 1889, interesting stuff possibly influenza virus Like particles, eventually land, documented transmission infected person close contact period time. What's latest anticipated timeline FDA approving &lt;12 fully approving Atlantic afford make COVID coverage free charge despite soft-paywalled, hard time understanding NYT can't. get tax write-off something? Definitely caps, - point - goal overall - reducing infections, reducing spread, reducing hospital strain (all course). good understand nuance though. Fairly early vaccination program, government got something fight EU supplies AZ vaccine. contractual dispute whether EU entitled doses delivered British factories well ones EU (which well behind schedule).

I genuinely think big reason problems America has. [The might otherwise anti-vaccine turned got jabs stick Brussels prove Brexit good idea. age population though‚Ä¶ said Cali given QR code mean impossible 3rd party provide QR code, like say Walgreens Walmart vax administered...hence question specifically state sponsored program. Clearly link is, asked question link.

Are usually angry people ask questions?  Lol percentages wrong. realise Scotland gone back already. Worth noting decline cases began schools finished summer though (including Scotland, schools finish earlier, cases also started declining earlier too). Stay safe. can‚Äôt imagine even minor issue required medical attention moment Texas. funny fools freaked deaths , freaking cases lol Dumbfucks. Ummm - obviously aware best latest infrastructure available everywhere...  think cooler heads prevail v morons still think zero covid possible US, we‚Äôll see covid become another thing. expect boosters semi frequently, vulnerable populations. 

Also NZ Australia slightly different next immunity from
Vaccines infections, they‚Äôre p much committed zero covid unless want get absolutely ravaged.   may think number people day dying ""with Covid"" UK big, put perspective around 1,500 people die every day UK things. 

It's also worth noting UK stats count anyone dies within certain period positive Covid test Covid death even might died things. Hence, long virus circulating always ""Covid deaths"" (as people random chance might die positive test result) even none people actually died Covid. I'm saying one die Covid, means stats never show zero Covid deaths, number deaths put context total deaths quirks stats get low numbers. Something like 80% population vaccinated, overwhelming majority 94% figure coming vaccinations, infections. Doesn‚Äôt change fact cannot trials doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, one SARS since burned 2003. flu doesn‚Äôt cause worldwide shutdowns brink single wave.

It before. 1918. There's also bad Flu pandemics, think 60s 80s. Granted, cause worldwide shutdowns, H1N1 close schools United States. Gonna raise numbers, then.  I'm confused too... comment originally posted 2 hours ago edited 39 minutes ago, wondering now. wasn‚Äôt pseudoscience, recommendations based incorrect initial hypothesis COVID transmits. Scientists hypothesized COVID would spread like cold flu‚Äôs‚Äîprimary surface contact large droplets. types barriers pretty effective cold flu.

It turns covid barely transmits via surfaces mostly smaller droplets aerosols, aren‚Äôt going stopped plexiglass. 

But lot advice get still based old information. lot evidence cloth surgical masks effective based studies large droplets aerosols small droplets. wearing N95s instead.

And battle politically masks, nobody talking effective, non-controversial mitigation techniques. Like setting AC thermostat 82 degrees instead 72. Open windows get airflow. Improving air circulation filtering. frustrating, people really want forever war.

I'm one people got recently covert booster, appreciate vaccination ongoing thing, different annual flu vaccine. People want entire world live constant state restrictions suspicious people refuse take vaccines all. Sure, I've stated someone else who's made similar point, we've hit point risk really problem UK either. 

We've extremely high vaccine uptake, especially older, vulnerable groups, almost every child's parents grandparents doses point. spread it, mostly children vaccinated adults. mention, at-risk vaccine holdouts probably vaccinate kids anyway. 

Personally think best let scientific consensus win issue, far UK say, panel top vaccination experts, [the recommended vaccination kids.   There's studies virologists said virus mutate far could ever fully evade vaccines.

They might end wrong, knows. choose hold hope. Modern ""journalism"" you.

I heard woman reporter somewhere Africa saying, ""The streets filled African-Americans......."" [Non-paywall I'd say paint complete picture, could show % overall US population that's vaccinated unvaccinated. Nurses paid fairly well area. sister nurse nursing home makes around $75,000 year. CNA/MA making least $15/hr, closer $20.

It though. longer take care her, choice.  thing California. Yeah coastal areas blue progressive go North inland hard red territory think said something completely different edited downvotes. move tour oooohhh saaay 2022. Ignorance bliss! I'm doctor, I'm guessing immune system binary system either on, otherwise people immunosuppressants die first cold catch?

They tested antibodies specifically condition, see much immune system would react vaccine. well! Also sorry mentioning schools right now. Scotland started go back week England/wales(&amp;ireland??) go back beginning September. I‚Äôm really curious see trend come mId October.. I'm proud live UK. recognise 'good enough' looks like, instead pursuing farcical elimination strategies endless lockdowns. Life goes - get pubs open.  They're much lower peak bad flu season gives, point. Precisely vaccine passport good idea theory, exactly practice. Way many people would cause tremendous headaches for, even though ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. want put kids mask forever fine, make everyone else it. H1N1 part family seem painting overly broad brush. reasons families homeschool varied. None homeschool families knew chasing fame. focused creating deeper education, time reading, experiences, pacing math child‚Äôs mastery rate, critical thinking discussion, time inquiry, time art personal skills development. 

Mine homeschooled 8th grade attended neighborhood public high school. got straight A‚Äôs made friends easily. Teachers told could tell kids homeschooled they‚Äôre engaged interested material fellow students. girls continue love reading learning. 20 year old read Shakespeare play last week intrigued quote came across followed source. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd see conventionally schooled throughout. 

I‚Äôll drop topic since intended COVID forum.I wanted offer opportunity see homeschooling broadly portrayed it. 

Wishing pleasant day. coronavirus 'left behind' ? in, respiratory droplets carrying virus still floating space came person space since left room?

&amp;#x200B;

for example two people talking space without maks social distancing. leave someone else enters space. person get coronavirus? Fines stop anyone. one thinks caught. death penalty deter murders. Clickbait article false information. UK reports 33,904 new cases 111 deaths 7% increase last week. Can't wait till hits streets Sussex Elderly people particular still dying causes suffering mild covid Yes are. 94% population producing antibodies, institute annual booster program.

It's literally success story. exactly get headline above.

Masking kids keeping home fills ICU beds? I'm confused. That's kind problem, get vaccine almost sure anything. lot docs take ""may well get case get antibodies it"" approach anyway. harmful, chance response better getting all.

Source: wife immunosuppressants think that's infuriates most. 

People see mortuary trailers headed San Antonio. see rising cases. see fact takes 5 hours ER broken bone literally stick treatment. 

Yet still go without masks without vaccines without care world. fuck need vacation Hawaii live Miami beach risk children stops minuscule majority Americans unvaccinated, that's Americans seem understand. UK ease vaccinating low-risk children (high-risk children eligible vaccines, believe?) many adults older teens vaccinated, luxury US.

At least, hope vaccine mandates masking schools question. figures many kids end hospital days?

Did review figures child mortality auto accidents [before choosing use child car outside, lower risk, probably fine

Play dates: indoors? masks. Outdoors? Probably want son enjoy life again...

He enjoy life wearing mask around people. enjoy life wearing pants? masks. mean guys Pfizer/Moderna execs? 


^/^s 'Zactly thinking. boarders up

This make pay Nah, hospital monitors them, otherwise low tech way- watch visual. Paywall? good thing. Increased vaccinations lead increased antibody rates. pinellas month ago people grocery stores weren‚Äôt wearing masks couple times I‚Äôve last 2 weeks I‚Äôve seen majority masks. Can‚Äôt say stores I‚Äôve tho  Yea know, that's pessimistic expectation.

But even year, people gonna take nose vaccine. It'll like flu vaccine, maybe 30% uptake people 65 maybe 70% amongst seniors. help, stop it.

If long lasting might really work. long lasting, natural infection upper respiratory tract also long lasting? would make vaccine different there? realized two months we're going track another metric: percentage people current vaccines. pretty much Delta Singapore. US plenty already. Germans allowed club 16? visiting Germany 2-3 years ago going go friend. didn‚Äôt stay long everyone seemed really young. Yes, think especially since parks still closed supposed go, helpful. hardest part declining asked wanted reschedule (we canceled late March 2020 writing wall ""it's two weeks""). think thing ends Delta you‚Äôre gonna disappointed. Big disparity depending location, degree, class. (though hate term, system much alive.) There's trend older demographic keep donned. 


My local supermarket relatively expensive (property wise) quaint market town probably 80% masked. go city centre similar supermarket drops 20% masked. 

It dropping week week, suspect people become comfortable going back ""'normal."" Well, I'm sure tell honest, guess different outlooks here. 

I'm going let continue bother me, tone US seems similar Delta first took months ago. We're past peak UK now, personally see reason optimism places peak starting loom. 

Best luck, genuinely hope things feel like they're improving soon. Vaccinated feeling weather, I'm proceeding I'm contagious. Got tested yesterday afternoon said results would take 4-7 days. Headache, sneezing, lots congestion, malaise, complete lack appetite, fever though...felt like nasty head cold ramping past two days already feel bit better morning yesterday. covid, feel like relatively mild case. last head cold *way* worse (assuming symptoms peaked yesterday.)

If COVID prob would called honestly - symptoms manageable decongestants pain meds - better safe sorry. want spread anything help it. know how. They've whole time ivermectin safe side effects according Facebook. I'm firm believer happens someone care know, change minds. 1st graders supposed willfully ignorant.....

they 1st graders thankfully gotten around booking airfare. Disney actually really great refunding deposits. feel fact entrusting care mom people paid livable wage? make feel assured mom properly taken care of? hear you. antithetical ideal free speech internet is, wish service blocked misinformation spreaders. opt basically cleaner environment idiots shadow banned. 

Just mental health.  &lt;0.8 considered negative 90 seems high. also remember immunity concept kinda requires random distribution.

If community people jot vaccinated, herd immunity going help much since... virus gonna spread among people. that? Coronavirus' basically built copy protection. reason virus large half devoted making sure copies exact. mutate like flu. flu practically purpose built mutate. Covid built mutate. got antibodies test.. 90U/mL. high low? Anyone like graph averages info? didn‚Äôt send much number. Lee Health county reported 12 died hospitals alone last night. Chinese testing kits? get. One news segment sick patient way motivating statistic screen. still sound concept, people get vaccinated people can't (i.e: kids), combined vaccines' reduced efficacy Delta, going struggle get there. It‚Äôs one Voldemort‚Äôs horcruxes Exactly. actually really good created centers. morally wrong deprioritize unvaccinated patients

You would wrong that, medical ethicist tell so.  Ok, believe want man. literally living like pre corona now, ending hospital let alone dead.

Do know old 90 people died covid were?

Do know issues had?

If not, know anynody else wind neck in. Great job Portugal! Amazing country amazing people. feel like living messed nightmare. Truly haunting. cousing AL posted FB morning- ""Anyone know virus gong around AL? kids sick week school"".  
Like covid even crossed mind possibility. don‚Äôt much faith chances recovery. can't keep ignoring misinformation fighting it. We've tried ... work.

I want mister nancy negative here, but, assuming fight set minds to. even less effective fighting it? law nature say good solution. NY A) One vaccinated states country, B) (at least live) majority still wearing masks indoors, C) adding vaccine madates (including get vaccinated test constantly teachers). Comparing us south dishonest. one rare people looks evil outside inside.  yes, fine. death toll 1000% higher jan Btw, took 2nd dose back June Covid, like flu kills sick weak. So, child underlying health conditions better keep inside. 

The mortality rate killed Covid compared test positive globally 2.1% (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracking Info). ages.

If look CDC numbers Jan 8/14, deaths age group 0-17 years old / total ‚ÄúCovid Related Deaths‚Äù chances death minuscule.

361 / 614531 = .06%

I think everyone make choice live end day. Either shelter inside go daily business ready happens. FWIW still interested, points UK study measures efficacy symptomatic infections US study measures efficacy *all* infections, which'd explain difference good, let USA diseased country. Compete things I‚Äôm sure pretty much every state folks like this, though. help otherwise maintaining herd immunity. odds infected everyone around immune low get. Last read data monoclonal antibodies muddy best: believe pills they‚Äôre out. wouldn‚Äôt bet them. existing anti-virals already iffy lots cases. Hi - wanted say INCREDIBLE success dealing (daresay HEALING) PTSD EMDR. expectations going (besides rave recommendations trusted others) mind blown well, immediately, started noticing tangible differences symptoms day day life. Please consider trying trained therapist establish rapport with. Also - promising MDMA-assisted psychotherapy get approval next year so. hope healing you, soon. chances another worldwide lockdown? lockdowns work?

As much don‚Äôt want locked down, it‚Äôs beneficial, I‚Äôm it. thing growing rampant &amp; losing lot lives.

I vaccine beginning, took would able live knowing didn‚Äôt everything help stop spread. That's one! I've read full book excerpt Daily Mail site contains specific comments risk escape-variants. read article say sending people hospital. correct thing do. ""turn away"". Ok, based though? really early throw idea there. another way putting it: long twelves vaccinated pandemic continue. New Zealand notable counterexample, however risk uncontrolled spread still exists, even there. opinion, approval process twelves already unreasonably delayed still treated sufficiently urgent. quote pandering minority louder meaner absolutely true. many ways beyond one. 

It's easier go want withstand constant harassment, aggression, antagonism. I'm happy therapeutics focussed on, far tell scientific medical community going crack working regardless public opinion right?

Vaccination far effective masks, we've vaccinated many people I'm really sure there's much point there. I'm dead set mandates, say public enthusiasm waned quite lot enforcement really feasible without that. 

As far tell, plenty workplaces schools lateral flow tests, plans stop. issue seems authorities either. stay right side you‚Äôre wearing mask. comes eliminating airborne contaminant 3 tools use address. Dilution, filtration, sterilization. 

1) ventilate space bringing fresh ‚Äòclean‚Äô air dilute occupied space level safe habitation. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen guidance this, comes cost utility cost extra AC, service call adjusting ductwork, quite possibly degradation space conditions.

2) add better filters AC unit, usually preferred properly designed filters good job picking stuff airstream cost better filters, uptick fan horsepower. Retrofitting better filters done lot nuances quickly go people‚Äôs heads might result restrictions. easier add filtration room level little individual circulation units, pretty noisy. 

3) sterilize air stream UV, many nuances well. Mostly, airstream moving pretty quick, different bugs need different exposure times inactivate. results small section air handler, many many lengths uninterrupted duct UV ensure kill. It‚Äôs impractical, space wise, cost wise, power wise. industry instead, adopted installing UV large air handlers coil sections keep coils clean keep unit performing optimally. offers chance killing bugs, degree certainty. 

4) realistic combination 1 2. Dilute much realistically without degrading space conditions, filter much without huge upgrade. Modifying frame 1‚Äù 2‚Äù two 1‚Äù filters stacked fairly easy. Adding section incorporate bag filters hospital style HEPA probably overkill. read article says walk-in center that's free open everyone, questions asked.

If uninsured underinsured makes financial sense try heading ER. good also, lesser virus carriers world, lesser chance anyone dying covid Well true so... Go home? monoclonal antibodies going help them. might well getting water injections. antibody infusion centers set care patients - that's they're lying floor image. well home much difference sick are. third. Saying trivial amount stock ignores stock option calls citadel has. regular shares $15 million, $170 million call options, become valuable stock price goes certain price certain date. does, could 2x 5x valuable. $1 billion $38 billion portfolio ""trivial""

Regeneron available since Trump bought going door. 7 months later touted ""miracle"" (his words) someone happened get largest single campaign contributions date someone whos stock options could worth billion goes strike price? vaccine hesitant friend one them. 

Even though internally completely patience her, kept conversation going. ok feel hesitant! ok confused even fearful. strange times. keep talking it. 

She reached feel judged. able ELI5 mRNA technology way made feel confident. honestly think would it, today got first shot. plan keeping conversation going gets second third. We're really final phases.

I'm glad someone saying it. really end COVID transitions endemicity. Unfortunately, likely deadly dangerous phase pandemic yet. symptomatic infection, yes. vaccines likely still protective hospitalisations deaths longer. lie floor waiting vax. remember kid parents smoking section restos. fuck even allowed lol. Yeah point article people already own. 

Guess they'd need significant number people controlled trial prove safe effective, one trial moment? 

That's guy means ""waiting data"", apparently someone running trial second J&amp;J shot booster, waiting see shows. also mention J&amp;J approval came later US, fewer people wound getting there's less data generally it. don‚Äôt know data you‚Äôre looking cases *barely* rising, deaths absolutely plateaued last three weeks so.

And *after* removal restrictions across U.K.  Hospitals full. going go. probably already turned away discharged early.  high school football starts tomorrow night, there's good news lighten mood. /s Texas daily covid infections peak? image link works fine. 

So vaccines best partial protective vaccines' protections decline rapidly six months, extrapolated. Oh, I‚Äôll reading then. I‚Äôm currently immunesupressants would reduce stress. already fairly solid treatment monoclonal antibodies? metrics I've seen given pretty good success rate stopping severe diseases. Pfizer already testing covid pill could year end. I'm obviously means doctor could also complete wrong. yet 7-day new case average nearly 30,000 rising again.

Doesn't seem like antibodies much good spread. Hopefully! Also, considering kids subbing round 4 COVID, I'm worried Delta gonna hit. Especially since parents gonna vax kids ones gonna believe whole ""Delta hitting younger people harder"" thing late. Though, I'm honest, I'm worried happens *when* next virus shows people like ""ugh forget it"" find late it's...a whole lot less ""forgiving"" COVID is. chances least one major scare today 2030. 94% antibodies, maybe 95%? Two questions mind!

If test positive Covid worth taking another test two weeks? would still system?

And secondly, live someone Covid recovered, got need quarantine again? government really put foot mouth many times point . wait solid data there. speculation hurt fight virus many times already . would take many shots necessary live normal confident life again. definitely think anything raises neurtalizing anti bodies prevents infection altogether best way prevent long form covid. Well, apparently federal government already purchased medication large quantities sends states similar send vaccine supply‚Ä¶so patients billed administrative costs, thus people without insurance would cover costs‚Ä¶.still cost effective vaccines let alone primary approach pandemic thought dumb get dumber... isnt new strain. I'm confused, says strain already accounts 15% US cases. original delta seems beating pretty handily. 

Smells like fear mongering. Yes since coronavirus subreddit context bemoan children's deaths subreddit.

It's kind like saying ""all lives matter"" whenever somebody says ""black lives matter"". big deal 350 kids dead dead kids. 

Seriously??

Since coronavirus subreddit subject literally coronavirus, makes sense whining kids died car accidents whenever somebody bemoaning fact children dying coronavirus coronavirus subreddit. Albuterol inhalers breathing treatments prescribed basically since day 1. prompted FDA approve generic Albuterol inhaler earlier scheduled deal expected shortages. also saying need booster weeks back? Yeah. main thing worries transmissibility virus vaccinated people, thus giving opportunities infect people continue mutate. wondering booster shots effective stopping COVID tracks passed on. confess dont understand issue well I've seen conflicting evidence well Delta transmits amongst vaxxed folks.

Especially since I'm hotspot, firmly conservative area, work couple people still vaccinated. I'm sure vaccinated. Not.

Thank you, Fox ""News.""  usually angry people ask questions? 

When people ask dumb ass questions easily Google 2 seconds, yes Nah, small Trump Fox News notice care there's narrative. They're followers, leaders.

Happy cake day. would encourage go spend time Medicaid funded nursing home try working one jobs. little staff old poor people sit shit hours end. job bad impossible hire almost ANYONE it. elderly vaccinated know vaccines keep hospitals. staff care die that. can't comprehend actually pretty understandable literally idea industry works never CNA before. system allows people vaccinated continue work. vaccines tools deal this. 


I would also encourage try apply empathy people uneducated poor minority immigrants already work impossible job. surprising worried vaccine standard midwestern mom facebook thinks vaccines cause autism. said Masks need kids school needs done school. They're obviously troll.  Tl;dr (or couldn‚Äôt find pdf, didn‚Äôt read): probably impossible falsify hypothesis laboratory escape, is: 
a) evidence zoonotic origin like novel coronaviruses found last 20 years, 
b) similarities early outbreak zoonotic coronaviruses, 
c) evidence laboratory escape like happened and
d) evidence WIV working coronaviruses genetically similar SARS-CoV-2

So, preponderance evidence points zoonotic origin. ever, work done. live CA surprised one offered CA vaccine QR code. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Agreed. vaccine incredibly effective ancestor strains, would stopped pandemic tracks. Delta, different beast. war changed. overcome Delta, see end things.  people 8 months unless trials. Dec 14 first day anyone could received first vaccine, Pfizer. they'll get boosters, what? small price pay normalcy. long hauler forum time.

Can share link forum? Heck, even baby's first checkups hit like 3 vaccines everyone accepts cause understand kids well-being. new vaccine something that's literally looking people right now, that's evil one lol nothing *essential* travel. suppose depends somewhat messaging... Distance reduce average concentration viral particles... like distance closer risk 100% risk 0%... particles larger fall, stay aerosolized disperse decreasing concentration. Humidity, ventilation, viral load, masks/filtration etc impact degree risk... mind 6 feet used reminder space, like suggested safe 6ft indoors without masks without vaccines - particularly.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è landslide last year, terms three years. Yes, think convincing new PM could work, politics NZ kind dearth talent right basically unopposed. problems gov, alternative abysmal tbh. use cloud services parts system - service runs custom hardware embedded software necessary product function. understand well statistics love passion science well scientific method particular. 

OK, Since virus symptoms often go unfelt mild measure account unreported cases?

I seriously doubt anyone knows make adjustment high degree certainty. done, adjustment would based estimate model, always uncertainty. Think estimate reported cases: track cohort time, force get regularly tested, hope catch virus. *Then* assume experiment still relevant, may time finished, given fast new variants emerged.

A better question ask is: would anything differently mortality rate 1.5%? 2% 3%, 5%? Probably no, public health perspective, no.

Also, **the definition mortality depends assumption available healthcare.** words, hospital runs oxygen fine tuning mortality rates goes Secondly, case numbers ones tested confirmed?

You'd need read fine print whatever looking at. know reading, can't say. Technically, every test degree false positives false never tested. case go uncounted?

Most likely, Lastly, counts COVID death?

Again, depends data sources. also perfectly valid reasons different definitions, question data used, determine appropriate definition given task. problem spread others contribute hospitals seeing spike patients. Vaccination would make less likely infected. saying 100% population vaccinated, 100% COVID deaths vaccinated people; fewer deaths overall. idea lot people hard time grasping really important. detract effectiveness vaccine everyone vaccinated, fewer people die even though every death vaccinated person.  Lol, like matters ICU full children unrelated conditions occur every single day can't get medical treatment. yeah, sounds right. see would short. think would last 6 months year. mrna vaccine faded quickly caused huge amount antibodies, they're intended hang around like forever. nasal spray affects whole different part immune system short lived. large South African study found effective hospitalization beta delta‚Ä¶ pretty good preventing getting sick Delta. Beta kinda kicked ass mark luckily beta anywhere near contagious. Singapore far fewer cases US. Singapore 50 cases checked. Vietnam quite bit worse almost 10000 cases though.

But compared US facing. US statistically worse.  8th grader first much longer Prime Minister Jacinda's term? Could new PM willing change things? 18 months forewarning it. God hope don‚Äôt think system another 18 months now. There‚Äôs way ensure 100% right everything say 100% time first time say though. Falling onto caution giving leeway unproven benign measures might ‚Äútheater‚Äù seems perfectly fine long you‚Äôre overstating evidence. People like ones would yell Rosa Parks get back bus lived 50 years ago. original comment caps ""EFFECTIVENESS HIGH VIRAL BURDEN INFECTIONS."" thinking thing. tragic easily go doctor get vaccination secret, friends family none wiser, yet choose so. r/nottheonion can't wait! specifically scheduled kick recall election

Like reading mind here, LOL. Say lot things Newsom definitely politically savvy. annual flu vaccine like 50-60% effective best.  old man watching TV home one day saw report strange new virus urging everyone avoid large crowds. ""Bah,"" said. ""I'm American. pray every day. God protect me.""

A months later neighbor's spring cookout, heard news broadcast radio governor ordered everyone wear mask public. ""Bah,"" said. ""I'm American. pray every day. God protect me.""

A year later saw reports new vaccine would fight virus. ""Bah,"" said. ""I'm American. pray every day. God protect me.""

A week later died COVID-19. approached gates heaven angrily demanded audience God. ""I'm American,"" said Lord. ""I prayed every day. protect me?""

""My child,"" said God, ""I sent news report, facemasks, vaccine. want me? Exactly. BA expensive AF point totally worth it. honest run rampant kids school age anyway. won‚Äôt know show little effect it.  working place houses vulnerable population. simple that. Yes, nursing homes struggling find staff, that's mostly part horrible management horribly employees treated day day, nature work do. that's even mentioning poor pay is. That's fundamental issue plagues nursing homes, needs fixed expect people work there.

If refuse get vaccinated, personal belief able work anywhere requires show physical location every day. We'll seeing lot companies posting vaccination mandates FDA approval, obvious exceptions, expect unvaccinated trouble finding jobs except remote work. free shot helps you, helps around you, sympathy screwed stupidity. 6% death. That's lovely, couple years drop life expectancy... mean, yea, end world. Smallpox exactly back anything.  never going go gloom sunshine night, signs showing clouds slowly part IMO.

It kinda sans delta. sure looks like (the US me, UK too) right around something like herd immunity back May, old strains. delta still growing alpha, wt, etc receded. future looked normal bright me. Like, probably get covid maybe life. still desperately trying hold belief COVID affect children looking excuse children hospitalized. Pre-existing conditions go phrase. forget, also made money donors (and presumably, himself) cancel re-book. happened every country. booking far out, cancelled rebooked next day. I‚Äôm surprised hasn‚Äôt push social distancing indoor capacities yet. Many didn‚Äôt think masks would come back. took vaccine I'm already infertile I'm sure could make infertile. There's needle fear there's actual phobia. thread seem dislike needles, phobia meaning see photo needle start shaking panic attack think getting injection.

I managed get vaccine (heavily medicated anti-anxiety drugs) found incredibly painful, looking made shout loud injected. tips really work people like me, need increase availability medication minimise pain anxiety. I‚Äôm lost, I‚Äôm frustrated, don‚Äôt know trust anymore. vaccine effective, seeing many breakthrough cases? Israel leading example moment, growing cases United States. Shouldn‚Äôt point vaccine eradicate something, ‚Äúlessen load‚Äù? even lessen load, load, matter small, still contagious still lead surge, we‚Äôre seeing Israel moment. already extremely difficult get workers job.

This mean get murder elderly surrounding super spreading idiots. fact, work anywhere principle. continuous response shorthanded completely irrelevant. need right. might mean make business pay more, give business money pay better plethora things literally cannot call decent human support complete garbage ""because they'll quit!!!"" that, September everyone get Pfizer too. Im confused, you‚Äôre immunosuppressants, even get vaccine? idea immune system identify react foreign object entering system, no?

With suppressed immune system, possibly achieve? Same. waiting shot took bandaid put on. feel damn thing. negative test result needs removed. lot happen 24 hours  can't. absolutely positively good reason go GLOBAL PANDEMIC let alone open. LOVE Disney. part punishment get vaccinated? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
