0,2021-10-16," Hmmm. many people reinfected? percentage reinfection deaths 0.003% (seems chance serious adverse ractions) happily concede point. Im nonsensical zealot. seems likely right. Imagine much asshole say he’s lying.

And likely isn’t, shit happens time you’re seriously naive works. First employees covered FMLA lot businesses aren’t required either, many US states sick leave laws like Texas.

I’m business owner California none employees eligible. actually went exact situation didn’t fire employee parted ways amicably understandably. lost 3 family members sick pregnant herself. knew couldn’t continue working paid could bonus went unemployment. wanted asshole could’ve fired laws would’ve stopped me. live Cali, state highest vaccination rates, @$$hole governor precious Gavin Newsom still forcing businesses require masks. I'm optimistic summer 2022 well, mean believe possibility variant high consequence (VOHC) coming VOC would considered VOHC without widespread vaccines natural immunity. still think unlikely given broad protection severe disease given vaccines (I believe I've heard they're even somewhat effective SAR1, source that) limited number examples diseases transmissible Delta (chickenpox, measles, whooping cough 3 main examples). surge cases (even without new variant; seasonal thing), places they'll manageable even get worse variant. 

There's still always possibility brand new pandemic non-coronavirus. Vaccines, booster shots, etc.

Not mention incentives pharmaceutical companies like Merck develop anti-Covid drugs substantially improved patient outcomes. things eventually turn Covid flu.
The real challenge get enough people vaxxed. Eleven hours minute side effects start sounds like might one lucky ones doesn’t get hit beyond sore arm. Congrats! I'm little confused -- measuring ""antibodies"" here, requirement everyone safe thing increases immunity respiratory disease? I'm expert, I've following [This Week many episodes addressed potential long terms effects scientists done studies yet

There never long-term effects vaccine show within six weeks vaccination. ([source: interview Dr. Paul Offit, developed rotavirus clinical trials went long enough cover possibility. long-term effects getting COVID looking pretty crappy lot don’t want make decision can’t take back

I totally get that, keep mind ""not making decision"" *also* making decision! effect made decision ""no, least right now"".

Unfortunately, virus going away, way see choice getting immunity controlled fashion time choosing vaccine getting uncontrolled fashion infection (including reinfection) unknown time may come nasty disease. longer keep kicking road, likely universe make decision I’m also comfortable take booster every 6 months

That's separate issue, probably actually take booster every 6 months unless really weak immune system (like immune-suppressing medications). People latched idea antibody levels drop around 6 months, there's good chance need high levels cells get job done instead. area active research; time 6 months vaccination we'll know lot more. Exactly, must've lying. actually good therapy types wounds. That's unknown. Time tell one. knowledge virus constantly evolving. Rules *little* people companies justify cleaning problems. majority nation's workforce vaccinated. brainer identify employees willing follow rules. 
These minimum wage jobs. shuffle people looking better employment. Jobs like highly desirable. Decent wages, health care, benefits. Yeah, COVID cases plummeting there’s always odd disaster looming, look covid stats assume, like vaccinated hospitalization rates increased (yet) Canada that's good indication still effective 6-8 months out. 'Over there'? *Where?*   tbf, billionaires got billionaired, others capitalizing build platform. sure happy, certainly might think worst thing many Florida Texas? Crazy negligence killing police claim back unless beating death US flags.  Yep. Friggin A. Bums we’re literally stealing young adults formative years away. saddens that’s we’re essentially letting elected leaders get away it. Politicians like Gavin completely disregard mandates go expensive French restaurants without social distancing masks. understand need measures vaccines, vaccines widely available highly effective point drastically reduces hospitalizations eliminates deaths full vaccinated, POS move elected officials part still force people live like 2020 again.  Nice see priorities lie, I’ll see side I’m happy it.

why even feel need say this

nobody happy Calling 2G 3G help conspiracies... Nobody really knows. may effective year, 5, 10. highly individual general case necessarily apply you. general protection increases repeated exposure; either reinfections additional vaccine shots. bad, actually third donated, US biggest donor far close 10 million doses. Thanks lockdowns, we’ve able bring delta back control know someone moved hospitals. new hospital didn’t ask vaccines orientation. afraid accused discrimination asked interviews.  You’re one saying “there’s adverse reactions deaths, don’t get vaccinated you’ve infected”. I’m gonna research you’ll find yourself. 

Just get vaccinated. lesson mandates work. know works, I'm suggesting would ever actually happen, saying wish would work way.  think rather dangerous territory, IMO.   since vaccines came out, people filling stadiums areas NFL games, MLB games, concerts, social events. 

Part could pent demand like kinds events. People tolerated going things expectation others may likely decide waste time something they're uninterested appease enjoy kind thing. 

I think they're implying gonna majority anything like that. Even 0.1% people 8 million people, lot people. third dose gives several times higher antibody levels second dose - theoretically enough 95% efficacy Delta Moderna Pfizer, similar efficacy wildtype original trials. know there's higher cellular immunity new antibody levels wane different rate.  I'm another long kinfolk right thing protecting us disease, give two poops political alliance is. Probability alone. 

The number deaths vaccines vanishingly small. number deaths reinfection hit around 100. 

Risk-reward suggests keeping antibodies especially you’re at-risk person (a nurse would be) better risk take. 

This scared fly problem driving territory bad thinking.  99% survived then. lol You’re welcome name industries, think you’ll find examples used exceptions rules. Southwest isn’t indicative airline industry whole, seen success. easily point United’s 97% vaccination rate. Manufacturing shipping labor actually asking priority access vaccines, strikes instead working conditions benefits. far police go, extremist issue law enforcement? Many people already planning retire year. 

There already “labor shortage” sense labor market general seeing huge shakeup, that’s bad thing. It’s led increased focus health safety, higher wages, way collective bargaining power. Mandates tiny blip much bigger market change, they’re still net positive. Yeah, agree this. However, don’t think lot people got vaccine due mandate realized wrong. couldn’t afford lose job. guys don’t think it’s bit odd last 10 years biotech companies trying release mrna tech public treat different illnesses weren’t able due significant side effects pandemic hits suddenly surreptitiously mrna tech perfectly safe.

not really. scientists fail learn, fail learn time. boom, success, that's built learning. science came treatment als, wouldnt suspicious failed treat last 100 years. 

if mrna gives pause, go j&amp;j, traditional. covid + j&amp;j would prolly result greater immunity pfizer anyway. plus, one shot. apparently leaked lab China

i dont understand origins virus anything. whether lab leak natural, killing people. yeah, scientists people immune corruption, vaccines low cost. expensive covid vax $36. point corrupting vaccines--the money cures treatments, thats corruption goes. 

as me, got vaxxed protect myself. als, got covid, would prolly die, covid neurological component. anecdotal, scientists reported two people als went cliff contracting covid (their als sped bedbound). mrna vaccines terrible, would prolly already killed then, eh? am, 3 shots moderna, 100 microgram payload compared pfizer's 30. I'm still walking around feeding myself.

but, im glad survived covid relatively unscathed, hope dont get second infection. keep safe, ok_manufacturer. hope find courage get vaxxed, said trying convince get it.   also going demand leeches bloodletting? Yes, company. Someone even put post FB stating supported employees protesting vaccine mandate. Hey, work company would appreciate sucked got vaccinated. vaccinated protect yourself, co-workers family. know Boeing laid people last year, right? yes, skilled labor, likely people waiting take place. dippy, YOURE one making assertion based feelings presenting facts.

So either post references shut crap spewing, go back edit last post let people know talking butt. third country’s vaccine doses donated US? assume back claim reference? don’t choice, importantly people laid would likely happy return. “protest” wasn’t exactly ton people first place. immunity third dose. 8-month dose raises immunity higher 1-month dose does. normal Victoria's COVID-19 Commander Jeroen Weimar Saturday said girl ""a number conditions"" died also tested positive coronavirus.

They aren’t releasing lot details preserve family’s privacy, wording makes think something serious going like cancer, may one cases dying “with COVID” thing dying “from COVID.” 

I can’t say sure, course, without information, don’t think held example parents worried healthy children. They're working though. industries still 15-20% various exemptions. including quit fired couple percentage points top that. We're seeing protests alreadymat Southwest various manufacturing plants well police forces. think we're point need mandates kid going cause labor shortages. people. I'm realistic, people better worse. Lawnmower mechanics 15 fatal accidents per 100K police 14. Construction helpers 18. yeah, relative level safety, I’d say. Maybe somebody tweeting police unions. people DIED reinfections. get vaccinated. don’t data everywhere one state tracking reinfections North Carolina. 

They 94 deaths reinfections. Cops dangerous job fear lives every day. time leave house know come back alive. Therefore perfectly understandable someone near appears sick pull guns shoot person, safe. 

Including guy choked french fries started coughing. Sure guy eating cop way knowing person also Covid.

Do say /s ? people pretend get guess say /s  worried heart inflammation make appointment doctor ask it, trust health internet rumors. hear Congress exempt taking it? got first back December going ICU nurses. Go talk doctor, thinking get anywhere, need reliable information real expert trust. I’ve hearing cousin quite months. Pre covid neuro-ICU worked covid unit months, PACU. telling they’re seeing younger younger people strokes “recovered” covid within last months. recently lost 34 year old stroke covid 3 months previously. Bugged cause age patient. Highly misleading headline.

A small shop selling BBQ equipment went court state government allow ban unvaccinated people store. court said that, owner premises, course ban anyone wants.

So state government changed guidelines order comply ruling. Saying store can, theoretically, ban unvaccinated people want to.

Making sound like government policy, even likely happen supermarket, inflammatory nonsense. Even unvaccinated people get die. Back day, culture penalized people changing minds. shitty words like ""waffling"" politicians realized wrong decided stop wrong. Instead, accept welcome people stopped suicidal desperate, bring human society. long long term immunity comes another mechanism last? Huh. guy combines data publishes r/CoronavirusUK, positivity rate Germany 3% long time tables.

And rate ""the Unsafe EU Countries"" bullshit phrase context place news headline. Accountability fucking dangerous man! antibodies wane, long term immunity comes another mechanism. cop dangerous job that's largely they're always driving. [1/3rd non Covid police deaths traffic police union really interested saving cop lives would think figuring reduce number traffic accidents design safest possible cars would one they're top priority.   appreciate saying that. really help. hearing makes transitioning back normal life much easier. Thanks! to, mild infections vaccination still issues that’s another reason want booster dose vaccine avoid infection altogether. ever time people get past aversion ambiguity uncertainty, last couple years. really shame promoted society start pandemic; would probably much better place now. No, highly doubt everyone get covid point. special anti-viral mouthwash give start visit, buy supermarket  I've heard people leaving department due mandate. I'm healthcare org.

...if people think is, good thing. One single-handedly caused multiple outages affected patient care.

I heard one person leaving mandate, they're going another heath org. understand all. Unless org take Medicare dollars thus ignore mandate... 5 nations planet deaths per capita, US worst.

I checked link supplied got following ranked list COVID deaths per capita:

1. Peru	6,144.05
2. Bosnia Herzegovina	3,355.95
3. North Macedonia 3,306.04
4. Bulgaria 3,168.4
5. Hungary 3,105.54
6. Czechia	2,860.81
7. Brazil	2,852.88
8. Moldova	2,685.47

10. Georgia	2,518.56
11. Colombia	2,518.09
12. Slovakia 2,345.22
13. Paraguay 2,300.76
14. Belgium 2,240.67
15. Mexico 2,222.79
16. Slovenia 2,216.05
17. USA 2,187.61
18. Italy 2,180.21
19. Croatia 2,175.05
20. Tunisia 2,142.25
21. Romania 2,106.01
22. United Kingdom Deaths last 7 days follow pattern. US still worst, top 10 mix (Iran, Mexico)... UK remains right there.

If compare per capita deaths last seven days (again, site linked), US comes 15th UK falls 37th. Definitely 2 states bad, never hear COVID-zero wonderland Definitely curious it’s going long time know. 

So far looks like long term outlook vaccinated covid better unvaccinated covid. Fewer long-term symptoms, looks like. we’re going waiting another year reasonably certain…. mean they’re using almost donating extras. That’s pretty amazing, say someone living country third doses come US. Rate fatal accidents higher lawnmower mechanics police think ""mandate"" right word here, even federal contractors. company choice work federal contracts employees choice work company. want something company requires, leave expect fired.

Before vaccine existed, choice; go work earn paycheck leave. ""mandate""; put concerns aside employer requires; lose job.

My health concerns matter then, health concerns matter now? blow guy's back, he's gonna get vaccinated. Especially since dont really know long vaccine actually works. Wasnt found Pfizer vaccines immunity starts wane around 6 months? police killed 5 times many spreading Covid gunfire ok tho, let antivaxx nurse take care antivaxxer whatever shit want get system It’s weird seem working. scaremongering headlines, industries seeing levels success. TSA seems like anomaly, that’s also good job requires degree. odds positions filled high. ultimately, much fun beat ideology forth, comes public health preventable deaths. seem lose sight conversations. sucks mandates country since it’s inception frightening people, cannot continue cater fears expense everyone else. buy hi-hiz shirt $2 shop, go actually perfect example/explanation phrase ""one bad apple spoil bunch"" -- job.  us J&amp;J recommended get booster 2 months getting first vaccine, even though offered first vaccine 6ish months ago booster available yet? “I think pretty much summer 2022” lmao you’re gonna really bummed it’s Christmas 2022 you’re hearing next variant surge mainly independent/small pharmacies. I’m Southeast.   Sorry, ""risking blowback"" headline? That's incitement. ~~STRONG~~ SMART SURVIVE! blood clot risk first dose AZ, offered people second dose Pfizer Moderna. heard second dose blood clots. Denmark Portugal ones I'm following closely. missing point. doses sent pharmacies across US used pharmacies. cannot sent anywhere else, includes countries.

So it’s choice un-used vials used boosters sent another country. It’s choice vials used boosters nothing all. friend works posted video protest Instagram.

sterilize nut jobs kf94 Amazon good too. argument debunked many times already. Again, 100 million people told get third dose would tremendous effect ability export doses.

But absolutely high value steady flow doses, CDC appears aiming current guidelines. way find local doses going thrown away otherwise? Ignoring question great! I’m pretty sure you’re pulling 90% figure ass since can’t find anywhere.

Do know whether every restaurant country follows vaccine mandate rules, nope! 

But that’s point! entire business sectors require vaccination. You’re acting like don’t exist vaccine mandates haven’t reality working whole industries decades.

My kid can’t attend summer day camp without giving date last tetanus shot! high plateau disheartening. virus seems incapable running steam.  Exactly, mandate arguably last thing , promotion tv , lottery thing … else do?   Total number deaths regardless causes looks vs years pre covid though RN get swung per year, that's low swingers tend abusive assholes I'm average sized guy. poor tiny nurses get swung time. 4yos go school here, kindergarden. I'm talking public school, 4yo older.
In kindergarden masks used almost child recommended, safe reasons, children 3.  Breakthrough infections exist chance severe high. virus mutation, that's kind viruses do. current vaccines need regularly updated readministered. Poor underdeveloped countries continue bad vaccine access years inevitably contribute mutations well vaccinated wealthier countries. think covid longer exists, I'm moving onto acceptance phase. endemic likely get point. good news vaccines phenomenal job protecting us severe infections.  speak this, since work. mandates almost nothing labor shortages outside maybe rural hospitals honestly struggling begin with. real issue pay, investment worker retention, sheer abuse. major burnout PTSD, can’t help feel like hospitals weren’t trying take cheapest possible way avoiding kind wage increases, probably wouldn’t shortage. least wouldn’t half bad. 

As mandates, would say vast majority us glad see people go. spread misinformation patients, validate extremely abusive behavior, endanger others. missed. actually want support healthcare workers, support unions, assholes. beginning february 2020 sudden surprisingly agressive wave flu area Spain, told. ""flu"" longest one recall. high fever, muscle pains, extreme exhaustion... coughed lungs week, point almost suffocating. got shorter version high fevers go emergencies, usually ""I catch every virus around get scaringly high fevers it"" 3yo runny nose two days.
After kept suffering extreme exhaustion another two weeks, plus generalized eczema petechiae legs two weeks. month half later, resolved without treatment (because none treatments got eczema worked doctors gave up).
During last four weeks go work again, ""flu"" supposedly contagious anymore.
Spanish Healthcare System good, get flu tests. mononucleosis ones. go doctor makes diagnosis based symptoms. month ""flu"", area first worst hitted coronavirus country. know happened later.
I say Covid know, could maybe spread half train commuting.
Or could happen tomorrow another new virus beginning new pandemic.
Let's test everybody ambiguous symptoms, always, identify have. endemic flu, rsv, covid, etc, heal home, please, let's sure first have. way something appears match known virus, isolate it, issue public alert, whatever.
We need learn past mistakes, number undiagnosed covid cases beginning pandemic, due lack existing diseases testing abundance assumptions led us awful situation. want happen again. happened region too, bunch rural folks thought stronger virus huge amounts people get really sick die. Fuck me, government panicked put measures, people used told covid science. winning like 25 % population.  STOP RESISTING DONUTS! good opportunities vaccinated people Seattle area! Damn, fatal? Chicago PD seems exactly 

The anti vax strong Exactly. don’t get vehemently refusing wear mask asked, especially since would protecting children immune comprised individuals. small insignificant. really worried labor shortages anyway. people leave jobs vaccine mandate go look another job somewhere else.

E.g. *The Economist* excellent COVID death tracker. Police unions don’t seem interested protecting officers’ lives danger except accountability. bad laws idiotic unvaccinated douchebags. Good hear, tend follow decisions US. Encouraging week TGA made provisional determination Pfizer apply. looked profile heck it, noticed old comment thoughts vaccine companies given total immunity legal liability saying true. already vaccinated interested people’s thoughts this.

So think right.... would nice demographic pie chart this. Even look sports normally rural white athletes one pushing vaccine mandate ie cole beasley nfl comes mind. Yes new people get laid off. unioned company. old mechanics don’t get laid get paid early retirement stay company.  non govt workers boeing required? executive order federal contractors.

Protecting staff stores one coming contact unvaccinated (and thus possibly infected) person inadvertently passing COVID onto family member vaccinated - young child.

Sorry people wish vaccinated understand made choice, everyone else right thing choice make. Choices consequences one, it.

The downside **chose** vaccinated. Society thus duty protect capable vaccinated. idea u get sick things happen due body shutting down. imagine getting mild/ moderately sick give life long problems Friendly FYI - event struggle self-awareness. coming across real a-hole buddy. Probably article that's statistically validating increase issues expected background rate, giving anecdote blaming vaccine that's well studied *not* clots occur background rate. fair lot CDC FDA experts taking attitude anything less hospitalization irrelevant nothing done stop (even something *can* done). They're leaning heavily message public statements. wonder get lot people taking true. always talk *say* going quit, many actually leaving Sure do, tell idea talking about. Fair enough. 11% though, third. would legitimately something like steal car keep job, sort sick corporate cult type game weed insencere. would it


And yet want take shot billion people taken? Ok mean Gen Z. found long covid symptoms cut roughly half vaccines couple studies, best evidence based guess 'less common negligible' similar long covid.

And even potential known half long covid risk many people furious refuse take consideration boosters (it effects spread too). Yes yes understand previous vaccines held standard *but that's different issue*. wanted smack doctor using reason weeks VRBPAC meeting. Nobody suggesting required show prevent symptomatic infections get approval, merely since vaccines *can*, ought *use that*. kids get vaccinated point people don’t protect themselves/their family, them. Breakthroughs tend extremely mild non-elderly. 

Your propositions sound lot like restrictions 2025 onward, simply feasible. sign says stand medical freedom
But wont allow woman abortions. Hypocrites different right now. stage yet Covid doesn’t really pose risk population anymore. many unknowns virus even “mild infections” impact body long-term. always will. make break metric ending restrictions. Zero covid possible. worker shortages caused dissatisfied anti vaxxers false narrative piggybacking real story widespread dissatisfied workers 40% significant enough. Also unions political pull matters lot. unions already gotten exemptions even Covid Restrictive Politicians. surprised Law Enforcement, Firefighters granted exemptions. Boomer comment boomer pic got kids clearly... Btw: mandates defense industry, government contractor, required federal government lose business.

And there’s option test out.    really feels like there’s metric end measures campus it’s hopeless. really finding freshman year. I’m junior it’s taken away. I’ll never get time back. never repeat over. 

If vaccines aren’t enough schools literally is? Im paying much never see friends faces sit room alone.  kids, huh? experience aircraft industry, trouble makers, they're old boomers think put time company owes paycheck standing around day. call 1st shift retirement community. believe senority entitles greatest respect works. HR bend backwards time God forbid agree backward opinions have.

I say get fuck let people actually want work money take place. I'm tired able see children weekend many old fucks standing around waiting die first shift. Heh. 

Yeah — fun fact, underwater welder ONE THOUSAND times dangerous police officer. Flu killed more!! wonder union lines arguments Covid killing five times many police officers gunfire has. TSA (and federal agencies) hasn’t required prove vaccination status yet, many people vaccinated haven’t sent forms since mandate doesn’t come effect November 22. wouldn’t worry 40% point, go way within next six weeks. I'm sorry deal new reality. sad see people dismissing existing conditions a) that's really shitty thing b) accounts pretty significant portion population. diabetes? Obesity? High blood pressure cardiovascular issues? Lung problems? Well, society kicked gutter enjoy remaining years worrying virus could severely impact quality life however many years remaining planet. Sad times. won’t people believe many scientists know professor infected one students last week. suspect ""near zero"" casually suggest. Virtually every vaccine take 2nd round (and 3rd, 4th, 5th rounds) months years initial shot. There's reason think covid caseloads stay high permanently, rare, there's need annual boosters make sense maintain high antibody levels, B cell immunity last indefinitely (people still immunity OG SARS).     anti vaxxers always say Healthcare workers quitting. lump everyone employed hospital, matter specialty education. Google it. Find reputable sources (osha, cdc, etc), see yourself. Personal anecdotes prove anything. could say I've exactly 0 jobs require vaccine life. mean shit though, that's experience yours. is, also ""mandate"" employer told work around anti-maskers social distance gave shit beginning pandemic.

I care want call mandate not, do, also need recognize vaccinated frontline workers already complied mandate.

I hope ass-hats boasted quitting really go it. covid-killer? Joe Rogan said fire. Research begs differ. Children basically achieved natural immunity. Booster shots need go grandma grandpa. living endemic looks like. Nordic Countries vaccinated children declared endemic, like flu. High risks groups got vaccinated, low risk groups natural immunity.  referring Unions, whether certain percentage professions vaccinated status good enough whichever city employs them. Unions pick choose battles they’re going go membership vaccinated think non vaccinated member’s claims baseless. already got covid, get tested every week, work home school home.

That's 85% right there. Now, know numbers overlap I'm also missing several categories. Either way, large percentage US employees require proof vaccination. 

Active military private sector. 

And like I've pointed before, states require vaccines healthcare employees, include numbers. 

There's educated estimate. think that? protestors, others like them, get fired disobeying fairly vanilla company-wide health mandate, essentially disruption work force. screaming toddlers achieve nothing. provably false. highly effective vaccines even effective younger people. We're choosing kids catch covid (and, occasionally, kill grandparents) rather letting use vaccines.

The ""draconian measures"" ""we learn live 2% grandparents dying avoidably every year"" arguments ended almost year ago. give up.

Get vaccinated. Houston Methodist lost ~150 25,000+ employees, minuscule going drastically increase workload anyone stays. They're already drowning, better get rid dead weight end making situation worse long run.   true article talking hospitals letting go 1-2% workers mandate. also specify patient facing not.

Also, like vaccination requirements new healthcare. hospitals require workers fully vaccinated including yearly flu vaccine. Mandating COVID vaccination groundbreaking way. Wouldn’t awesome mandates cleaned police stations decades failed reforms BLM couldn’t? start posting minor trivial side effects now? like people reddit? idea. guess people want keep dying preventable disease. also seeing supply problem recreational drugs alcohol? retiring? expect find another hospital job without mandate? court said that, owner premises, course ban anyone wants.

Wondering interesting ways leveraged future, ban reasons.  Yea, definitely ""mandate"" since govt directed condition employment (but many loopholes). mandated everyone company. Losing job consequence complying, fairly severe vs normal fines etc.

The number exemptions also really gets people protesting mandate. protection strong Union. getting downvoted? urgent need get children vaccinated. Children always low risk population. Young children went back school without issue Europe long US did. surprised countries recommend it, already starting recommend high doses younger populations based data. Nice Sucks privileged, imagine so... Right ya buddy. sucks concept ""letting"" everyone catch COVID..its admitting fact catching COVID inevitable scientists saying. endemic need learn live it. spread cannot controlled even draconian measures. huge achievement people Auckland, hope leads quick resumption normal life.

Beyond human angle, also admit clinical curiosity experience breakthrough cases, since much population vaccinated almost once. get real-world experiment contrast with, e.g. Israel’s experience, opening occurred months later relative vulnerable vaccinated.

In Israel’s case, know Delta caused enough breakthrough cases take steps back, roll aggressive booster program. Since much New Zealand vaccinated past weeks, perhaps much less severe experience, since much time vaccine efficacy drop?   children known carriers disease? Anyone ever worked school daycare knows this. saw price 80/20 ground beef go $3.29? $5 pound. discounted still good-looking package waygu also $5.

Inflation killing us. Wages never rise enough. double. 

And even did, would turn money Weimar Germany Zimbabwe. 
The power dynamic everything skewed favor owners.

The wage-earners, non-capital gains, non-investors, akin lemon continually squeezed. I'm hospital coder. biggest high-dollar COVID charts week, terms length stay, around 40-50 days. 

Do enough PTO sick time cover long stay get COVID? well enough go home, go rehab, long-term care hospital? much pay co-pays? short-term disability can't return work? Long-term disability? 

Do worry long-term effects COVID? Whether people get winded walking across room recover lung function? long long-haul COVID last? brain fog ever gets better?

I got vaccine want find answers questions hard way. Idk you’re getting downvoted 50 people pharmacy, 3 people refused vaccinations 3 people got exemptions. think many people leaving jobs due mandate thought. say required want easily get exemption. country majority white. So..will totally understand black NBA players want get vaccinated either majority communities want either? They'll put back realize difficult actually dealing children is. 

Literally parent pull kindergarten early September problem strict masks covid protocols, also apparently picking kid telling cant hit people. Anyway, parent basically says she'll teach herself, hard be. Kiddo pretty... interesting behavior needs (hitting tip iceberg. Many confabulations also avoid consequences). got email she'll returning Monday. 

I personally pulled kid whole first semester kindergarten remote learning working (he sensory processing disorder potentially ADHD and/or ASD). experience ECE also studying SLP so, I'm familiar literacy language support. hard af. happy returned face face learning missed many social interactions peer models district DILIGENT AF comes protecting students. 

He's first grade he's okay kids really struggling ways teachers saying really seen before. example, kindergartners much emotional less independent. First second graders similar circumstances big need support fine motor social emotional learning. Third grade fifth graders straight feral. That's like think. think makes easier blame white working class minority working class groups mandate put work. Boeing working whole time covid like two years. world living in. u seen news gofundme boeing employees disabled covid? outbreaks covid like every month send infected home work rest folks. already endangering past two year. Ur story doesnt make sense. didnt even protest sent back work covid protesting vaccine.   toxicology lipid nanoparticles, delivery mechanism mRNA vaccines, amounts oxidative stress take anti-oxidants like vitamin C, protect repair damage things like... eating meat cured nitrates, eating steak charred Maillard reaction (forming Advanced Glycation End Products), protecting super oxidase.

Start actually interested researching. also look bio-distribution clearance studies mRNA vaccines.

Really, TLDR, get shot take vitamin C.  Well obviously hoping that's case information included      think missing point original post thread arguing things opposed.

Simply put, OP questioned people suddenly upset needing get vaccine stay employed. point, new concept Americans relation employment. That's it. think 90% estimation wrong, it. come conclusion that. 

And excluded military everyone knows get vaccines agreeing terms enlistment contract. hardly getting job local grocer. look list cities list states? Seattle make list. anecdotes cool mine, numbers numbers.   really depends insurance. Mine covers good bit, wouldn’t leave $50k hospital bills, real issue lasting disability. tell me, much companies enjoy keeping people can’t physically keep production last workday? treat cancer patients, really? again, one outbreak unvaccinated plant means weeks months closed down. 

Sorry man, it’s market. There’s skilled labor willing take jobs, international vendors/suppliers, let alone local PNW suppliers, aren’t going look kindly plague factory. would endanger employees way? sure factory even going able fill orders? strikes involve asking things like better pay better schedules benefits. don’t demand right gum works infect others. Meanwhile, suppose odds finding decent paying skilled job without following kind Covid protocol, including proof vaccination. Especially locally.  Hey, tall white matter ;) bit conundrum. Throughout 2020, mother scared eventual vaccine. talked got vaccinated March year, second shot April. Now, really pro-vaccine. That's great. got booster shot week, thing is, wants everybody family get booster shot. feel like shoe foot I'm one reluctant.

 
With first two shots, science completely onboard. **Get vaccinated**. science different booster? recommended everybody. recommend booster everybody? say CDC website at-risk people get it. I'm fat guy I'm otherwise healthy. go hospital decade health conditions. read CDC guidelines get booster I'm sure meet guidelines aside weight. weight enough reason rush get booster even though recommended at-risk people?

 
If get booster wonder mother would react would make scared vaccines again. fact they're recommending everybody go get booster confuses really know do. feel like wait see if/when CDC expands guidelines recommend everybody get booster shot, there's technically nothing stopping going get booster shot right now. wish knew recommending that.

Private businesses always able that. Nothing change. add nuance, 'one bad apple spoils bunch' thing definitely true, I'm sure 100% say unvaxxed people definitely bad apple. 

Anecdotal, programmer working literally carrying team got there, everyone would look cause really good job. also crackpot conspiracy theorist anti-vax. Weird guy, also actually really good programming. Humans nuanced weird like that. 
Point is, opinions skills related Sorry, know big business, absolutely cut ties hire others get away it. They’ll hire scabs wait people out. They’ve done million times country, we’re start gaining back rights bargaining power workers.

Most big insurance companies longer covering Covid care, means get unvaccinated person get sick one new variants, you’re hook money you’ll weeks longer, assuming don’t end disabled entirely. Much like insurance companies take weight smoking account, you’re messed previous Covid refusing take precautions, bet they’re going try drain whatever can. That’s roll.

Also, factories think outside vendors suppliers. reputation they’re plague factory mediocre workers can’t bothered take extremely basic health precautions. Doesn’t seem worth bottom line.  throw false information days hope bait Kudos articulating points well also addressing :) Non-sarcastically, appreciate hope good day today! so? don’t know enough German law know protected classes like US, outside protected class see issue private business banning whoever want.

Upvote ""manifested."" thrown essential oil there, might even given award. ;) risk death near zero, however sometimes death worst outcome covid. Looked cdc website saw least 20 states requiring least one type vaccination. Also saw cdc website workers childcare education need show proof vaccination.

Add state mandates Covid I’d say point states sort health cate vaccination requirement.

Looks like major corporations require proof Covid vaccination (based recent google search).

There many Covid mandates point hard find anything earlier vaccine mandates.

Law fare telling Supreme Court ruled favor vaccine mandates since 1905.

Law fare also told smallpox vaccines mandated one point throughout US.

The Supreme Court cases going back 1905 references smallpox vaccination tell long legal history US vaccine mandate. goes back original point - vaccine mandates common part US life se ages (well actually century!)

Sounds like whole country mandated smallpox vaccination one point. company federal contractor. Often times, employees assist programs cross govt commercial. problem majority US medical conditions means still risk can't ""move on."" sorry mental health, people older 50, many health issues make Covid outcomes worse (even breakthrough cases) make majority country. Hospital nurse here! We're already short staffed af. make much difference all. Good riddance people believe science. Federal vaccine mandate go effect anyways?

So far corporations, hospitals, schools tens thousands employees examples compliance. I'm still waiting businesses hundreds even thousands employees enforce mandates. Well sounds like cost benefit analysis employer. gonna production issues due large amount employees strong enough conviction bet give exemption methods avoid vaccine. Insurance ask people vaccinated pricing. would u think would covid didnt ask hep b vaccine flu vaccine. We're regular people working every day serve country. want better life children. We're evil :( Well, flipping good news! Thanks, OP! Washington. Pacific Northwest white. makes demographic info important? fuck comment political? people trained. Boeing major issues time now. Sooner later accept rot workforce going balance out, includes companies propped federal contracts.  benefits vaccinated? Eventually becomes productivity liability issue. cost insure going go roof unvaccinated outbreaks completely grind factory halt. It’s cheaper hire new employees deal nightmare.  19 months still “news” ugh. giggity assuming CDC recommend people obese?  yup, shit. Yet ton people claiming masks much, vaccine. geniuses completely ignored essential workers rest us protecting infection vaccine availability, like amnesia something. We’re tolerating impact lives. misleading? court set precedence. stores want use can, including supermarkets. Instead nasal swab anal swab test COVID, maybe give semen sample instead? It’s nice Spain also strict age ranges like that, moment better UK (but fingers crossed).

I think key difference Spain lifted restrictions much slower gradually UK. UK declared ""freedom day"" July many 20-year-olds unvaccinated. Spain still pretty tough restrictions point, eased lot still stricter UK.

I think realistic 100% remove restrictions kids vaccinated. least whose parents agree.  California told ready start vaccinating 5-11 year olds beginning November.

Interesting, would make sense try get winter fully hits US too. I’ll ever like (and need to), cheers. wear non-woven surgical mask properly, remove mask meals drinks throw mask away immediately. 
If this, problem fabric. 
Anyway, shift mask, throw away. need 2 4 masks day.   Also worth noting UK also mostly used different vaccine W European countries.  might major factor much higher number cases, could playing role, even say 10% less effective Delta.  purely anecdotal, occasions I've deal New York State Troopers, they've pretty damn professional. least compared county's cocky-ass sheriff deputies. counting north numbers. north different political regime illegally occupied Turkish rule, laws south does. far know, vaccinations mandatory Pres Nik regime

The EU portion Cyprus south 80% Yeah, especially considering Germany way less infections countries. 

It’s looking bad everyone one else quite well days.  Antigen tests 50 cents German supermarkets. pay 25 euros?  propose government do? Close restaurants etc again? Anyone wanted get vaccine able to. Part issue 2G ruling (only recovered vaccinated people) optional state mandate.

So stores/facilities/etc. use could considered discriminate unvaccinated people, may lead ""actions"" them. vandalism, simply bad publicity maybe even attacks. things happened before.

It also leads uncertainties working staff. lose job vaccinated not?

&amp;#x200B;

One issue conspiracy theorists anti-vaccine people take vaccine either way. may even feel reinforced methods.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's also group people merely hold imho healthy scepticism side effects vaccines. Yes, lot data, there's also bunch really know seen side effects time seen before. Most, all, rare, that's true, people clairaudient it. mention people actually died taking vaccine may may related it. 

I know deal almost constant pain left chest, unable move left arm without issues (painkillers get rid it, ease little bit) sometimes bit trouble breathing since getting booster shot weeks ago. may related, people careful reports. 

Now vaccine actually necessary things beside getting minimalize risks getting and/or transmitting it. merely want wait little bit longer see happens researched longer time. imho understandable yet get thrown category conspiracy theorists anti-vaxxers receive penalties.

It considered unfair know quite people saying ""if want discriminate merely want wait bit sceptic new vaccine want ""force"" us directly methods, take it. want play games."".

It's bit ""bratty"" response, get push lot people ""I get vaccine"" corner. got 3 shots due conviction, still understand people (not conspiracy theorists co, bit sceptic want wait). People simply want discriminated against, matter reason.

&amp;#x200B;

The last issue creates whole new mess chaos. stores allow unvaccinated people not? cinema able visit not? on.  definition long Covid? Also know cases problems even 1.5 years getting infection? asking know one person Long Covid went away 6 month. got first round early 2020. always wondered trains employees spot fake vaccine cards deescalate confrontational situations. Well I'd say bit odd direction country otherwise declared would general vaccine mandates. dangerous made be. That's I'm saying. report says self-employed workers 3 times likely suffer fatal injury regular workers. dangerous business owner field police officer.

Ultimately says self-employee's respect safety practices, I'd say, anything else parents bitching loudest virtual learning effects it’s kids ones oppose masks schools. really rock stupid many different levels. whole “elderly” story doesn’t work anymore. Covid leading cause death among 35-54 year olds September. cases skyrocketed among teens 20 somethings. never vulnerable disease. Children less susceptible alpha-variant COVID, countries one arguments keeping schools open. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* misleading all. Supermarkets Hesse free require proof vaccine/recovery. reason change happened relevant.  That's pretty incredible though. Correlation ≠ Causation.  Yep also live permanently people’s eyes theoretically allowed supermarkets use 2G rule think supermarket region use ban option. smaller shops mostly rely consultation shown interest. people never care question regards shopping.  Watching news Korea last 2 years(living highest mortality rate country world)... Extremely low mortality infection rates, extremely high vaccination rate(once got serious it) cities high population density taking severe lockdown measures... close ground zero.. I'm envious SK... wonder case study deal future respiratory pandemics. Right. longest time first started person school again, plastered kids don’t spread it. Like COVID special kids don’t spread peers parents, still extremely contagious adults. Idk. Made sense. mention kids wouldn’t wear mask practice good hygiene social distancing good adults might capable doing. 

Yes. Kids Petri dishes! November 8 Canadians? I’m fully vaccinated Canadian currently New York City vacation. issues going restaurants shows. ever showed second vaccine certificate says “you received two valid doses.” double Pfizer mixed doses one would’ve known since never checked first certificate. 

My understanding November 8 date barred countries (UK, Schengen area, South Africa, etc). Canadians able fly US non-essential purposes months now. us suppose land border. China EU exported way doses US. US donated doses. Yeah look us (Portugal). good vaccination coverage people partying full nightclubs, public transportation full sometimes. Right now, need masks inside public transportation, big shopping centers hospital visits. Rt seems increasing slightly, deaths hospitalizations still going down. Covid seems (almost) thing past. pay take test thats good 72 hours 2 weeks 2nd dose considered fully vaccinated.

How convince her? 81% vaccinated Spain, cases fallen dramatically. Sort levelling now. restrictions gone left problem. Can’t veterinarians prescribe anything animals FDA approval people? (Asthma inhalers, antidepressants, etc.)

They obviously wouldn’t want without figuring species-appropriate dose first.

And may may work all, depending species involved whether tweaks made make vaccines work well humans (eg. pseudouracil substitution mRNA vaccines) also work well species question. since vaccines originally tested animals, suggests cross-species portability.

And they’d hopefully need obtain doses way didn’t deprive humans (eg. human vaccination site day expiration, rather ordering manufacturer still countries don’t enough vaccine).

But theory, think veterinarian would allowed give FDA-approved human vaccine animal. Denmark total 2 COVID related deaths aged 19 younger entire epidemic - population 5.8 million. number long COVID cases probably higher, general seems Danish kids quite resistant.

The government still running campaigns convince young people vaccinate. argument campaigns ""for society"" stay open. Save energy, he's open reason. mom reads this, go crazy. finally convinced get vaccine, care much now. 

Or ban count people one shot still unvaccinated, like school does? problem articles small groups protestors nothing noting actual scale, large corporations acting real problem crippled people strike.   Yes actually no. course countries rising % cases least dealing 30k+ cases since mid July like UK.

Just give examples:

Italy way smaller surge cases summer actually still slow steady fall cases since mid august 2.5k average last week.

Spain France pretty big rise cases like UK soon steady fall cases actual stable trend 5/6k cases average France 2k Spain. France increase cases way smaller % wise UK according last trend.

Portugal said rise looking % still everything pretty much stable thanks high vaccination rate.

Only germany one big european country facing pretty big rise cases like UK. 

You know Germany UK common? falling behind vaccination countries climb stair vaccine population. 

Just look shit show Russia days: 30% population vaccinated highly disputable vaccine rising deaths cases every day.  come 46,7 % vaccinated Cyprus? I'd feel lot better peer-reviewed study preprint Since fundamental rights explicitly forbid discrimination based sex, ethnicity, religion, skin color, language, political views, etc. much implication this. court basically ruled ""vaccination status"" based criteria. None actually want it.    Intelligent Voiceover: fortunately blowback New cases relatively high plateau since beginning July. far deaths remained stable much lower rate previous waves.   call bullshit, comments profile politicians blowing pandemic proportion I've asking weekly Uni work allow bring golden retriever site. They're ....., constantly saying no. knew would blow would waited get vaccinated. Lot people work media narcissists. think media projecting.  clerk got shot recently asking customer wear mask. think means kind danger. Store windows might risk next weeks. 

Corona conspirators crazy Serious Voiceover: Unfortunately blowback Yeah, lack transparency logic (aside rather transparent political agendas watching ""advisory panel"") incredibly frustrating.

And leads additional division, state local health departments start ignoring them. state health department (which sure hell trust federal ones) telling anyone wants get third dose attest they're risk group.

There's definitely legitimate reasons wait longer third dose, tell people time yet. that's communicating all. Two sure would rather quit jobs. One already advertised toys etc sale preparing it. Ah, worry smallpox malaria killed more. big brain you. we're clear. bruh I've awake past 30 hours I'm cranky af saw article said schools California told ready start vaccinating 5-11 year olds beginning November.

Also comment UCSF doctor trials 5-11 year olds found serious side effects. 


So I'm assuming 5-11 year olds go time imminent. Sigh.    news FDA panel voted recommending boosters everybody, went recommendation at-risk people. That's what's concerning going getting booster right instance. CDC website specifically boosters mentions people health conditions people live/work high risk places. feel fall camps.  feel conflicted types policies. 

On one hand, important protect society whole get infection rates down.

On hand, longer let asshats willingly kill themselves, nature heals itself. Natural selection....finds way. got blood clot. Period. common people think. Vaccine almost certainly nothing it. Hello, Mr Putin. stop intelligence agencies pushing anti-vaccine propaganda countries. directly kills population (more democratic countries even, apparently) harms children. Also, stop trying turn Siberia tropical paradise - billions people south insist living homes become uninhabitable.

Note: Vladimir Putin message previous one meant you. see him, though, please pass on. Also, get vaccinated. numbers u dive deep study data. science unanimous agreement third doses overwhelmingly good. can't quite agree take (6 months good, know 12 months could much better; maybe waiting longer better moderna pfizer; maybe using smaller doses third dose) whether wait Africa get vaccinated first. Yes, I'M incivil one, person breaking basic fabric world rejecting anything feel right spreading baseless lies. Thanks TIL. google that. Thought made up. Interesting job. Wow. Aw jeez, blowback?

I *obviously* COVID yet. twice I've mild cough lasted less day... again, hate dusting, could explanation :) 

All same, also possible might mild case COVID even know it. Weird times...   good reason masks, since early booster halt germinal centers letting memory bcells tcells develop long term memory based immunity inside them, resetting important work vaccine prevent serious disease. absolutely need time shots, absolutely need wear mask, along everyone else wearing masks, reduce chance exposure immune system develops robust immunity. I’ve used FMLA quite bit paperwork apply - isn’t automatic. would hope workaround people cannot apply sedated, etc., workaround would probably involve family member proxy application. There’s also caveat smaller employers required offer it. Incorrect.

Combat fatalities civil war listed Spanish flu killed 50-100 million 1918. Correct I’m off!!  cannot ostracize large portion population simply ignorant. cannot set draconian precedent order punish them, slippery slope lead conflict, violence, death. Us vs begets hatred leads destruction. need educate brothers sisters show compassion. History full tyranny based precedent advocating. unvaccinated afraid losing autonomy body, threatening starvation, oppressing bring side confirm fears lead many extremism. societies rot. unvaccinated made choice, want preserve right choice, even though ignorant us, still important part liberty. Spanish flu epidemics 1917 killed greater percentage- sure, medicine really, almost people wore masks.

The average number influenza cases per year US 35,000,000.

Deaths average 30,000, mortality 0.086%.  death rate 1.7% , 20x higher.  

The US generally averages around 190 million flu vaccines per year, that's something 20x less deadly, seem cause long term side effects.


So yeah, bad, Covid clearly dangerous. people freaking people created hell us health care system past 20 months. complaining narrative. went masks working vaccinations approved ""you still get vaccinated"" omg, firing nurses. 

They care anyone got let go. want see world burn. articles I've seen mouth washes nasal sprays focused healthcare staff - people really pretty easily use, say, povidone-iodine mouthwash four times day use anti-covid nasal spray every hours. They're ones consistently exposed covid. 

I betadine carageenan nasal spray, day close unmasked randos use times course day, figuring repeatedly reducing viral load hopefully means clear infection becomes big deal.

As vitamin D, statins, etc, none stuff magic vaccines masks big concerns, I'm pretty comfortable using something reduces risk small additional amounts. feel like sometimes slip ""don't drink iodine, cure covid"" ""using everyday treatment make small reductions risk masking vaccine weirdo freaks want drink bleach"". thing is, want covid avoid - I'm glad vaccine almost certainly keep hospital, want two weeks feeling awful want long covid. Well, I'd say yes, no.

The data mostly keep eye hospitalisations, one pretty much trust it. like say, less flat around 3 months. 

On face it, that's worrying, but, real world life back normal. go work, travel around, see family friends. Sure, there's chance I'll catch covid, back mind now, except odd google weekend review news (like now!). Life moved on, something live now. want live it, stay home cower.  lost 16. Originally 240 threw fit mandate, 16 actually refused end. FDA recommend eveeybody largely feel enough point boosters low-risk people. sounds like much high-risk due weight. There, comes Jeanie new boyfriend. cases increasing past two weeks according prevalence infection third straight week, one 70 previous week, according Office National Statistics (ONS). police went way hard could immediately order get exempted vaccine mandate.

Because police typically absolute Einsteins, obviously. Yes it’s land border we’re mixed doses always ok flights? reporting probably protecting children masks would good plan. Correct answer time. actually new direction though, confirming legal status quo (businesses require certain things long discriminate ethnicity etc.).  Chinese Communist Party exists protect Chinese Communist Party. Bad news suppressed culture fear means people keep silent. got lucky SARS 1 suppression virus infectious people ill move. ""unknown coronavirus Wuhan origin"" known back January 2020, infectious symptoms start combined CCP standard behaviour dramatically disadvantaged world's initial response early stages. State vaccine mandate huge national (I would think) thing though. Simply confirming Hausrecht specified federal statement practically legal news far understand it.  I'm expert feel like common sense vaccinated people caught covid probably less long term complications compared people vaccinated got covid. US. bars restaurants implemented vaccine checks door. Supermarkets free to, done cheaper people get sick turn away customers. care denying entry ""optional"" things like theaters soccer stadiums. issue supermarket, gets territory ""comply, starve"". take business supermarket require vaccines. Vote wallet. parents fault..not kids. parents say....sorry--if choice disease/death stay home--my kids would stay home....unless driving crazy disease/death might seem better. safety first applies kids norm...but parents can't ""parent"" stand them--the latter acceptable. ruling rights businesses, vaccines.

All they've said supermarkets, private businesses, prevent customers entering basis vaccination status. 

Another supermarket could, ruling, ban vaccinated entering. would political prerogative. Many people may, title suggest that. even remotely familiar situation country, unlikely jump conclusions. read way all. described entailed ""can"" title. think got mislead thinking misleading. considered fully vaccinated two weeks second shot. Pretty sure means vaccines approved FDA WHO. Hospitals arent filling people arent really dying really news Yeah I'm waiting day might able ban wearing shoes shirt. That's we'll know we're end days! 3.7 million total motor vehicle fatalities US since 1899.  

We 700,000 less 2 years.

Covid death rate 20-25x higher even use crappy analogy. youngest Millennials finishing graduate school…. ""Hmm...let every kid US get infected SARS or... Zoom school. SARS Zoom...damn hard. I'll go SARS?"" American colleges still online? That's ridiculous everything else open. Interesting enough gov would fight exemption guards. public health anymore. Well, cannot expect switch restrictions one day see spread, especially weather starts getting worse

Which government  Probably half car accident deaths alcohol drug use. Another 17% speeding, another 20% bad driving ( distracted, ignoring signs, etc).

You take test able drive.

Generally drive well, kill people.

If make bad choices, like drunk driving, vaccinated, kill people selfish choices.


Your analogy bad, flawed, wrong.  Try again. fall ""micro-chipped DNA editing sterilizing vaccine"" conspiracy rabbit hole, segment population mentally stuck 5 years old.

That fit threw mommy told eat greens central part identity. literally boils ""NUH UH, CAN'T TELL DO"", nothing more. That’s good. time-frame doses NZ? guys uniform vaccination rate across country? Canada still fourth wave much higher vaccination rate that, mostly pockets areas much lower rates vaccination virus still raging. 

Here’s situation BC right now, example. 

www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6211340

In province, Ontario, situation much better, much, much cautious approach reopening BC long lockdown. Even so, situation remains fragile. Fair concept, terrible language.

Police perpetuate narrative job incredibly dangerous justify excessive use force expensive equipment, well gain support communities sort gang heroes martyrs making great sacrifices us. do, fewer average garbage collectors, also don’t shoot dog. local garbage man every bit much hero local cop, likely deserves quite bit respect given rampant corruption, racism, brutality departments sweep rug. Ahem, Boeing hiring, I'm fully vaccinated here. Also big fan science medical experts. Thank consideration. Ah. thought implying 1% work force would lost due death Covid.   true: reason kids went back school cause parents could stand them...

Kids negatively affected school via zoom. value interaction class room, school yard person teachers. People gotta read/watch Jonathan Haidt! one shot J&amp;J yes, considered fully vaccinated. Otherwise, no. certainly reaction. Well, actually thought ""duh"". seems same. :) friend's mother fired 30 years working doctor. Two years away retirement. get retirement package. Chose lose instead getting vaxxed. friggin moron mean yeah, gunfire huge problem pandemic another level, course killing many people, police officers, pandemic bad USA leading cause death every group, except perhaps children. Ah, confusing social anxiety normality nothing sort.

Whilst understand it, that's nothing understand rather lack skills understand it.

But grain majority people like experience like socialise get about. Ooff  recorded, logged, studied. better healthcare people. talking pandemic exposed worst humanity due people may decide society worth dealing with.  Half dose Norway. one shot  often mention Long Covid, probability reduced 50% catch virus vaccinated. Yeah, might sound high... that's catch virus first place, whose chance heavily reduced vaccine.

Long Covid worry fully-vaxxed people places like US UK, low-spread country nothing burger.  'merica  speculation constant contact non vaccinated people behind phenomenon. people going work Brussels, Wallonie, etc. mixing unvaccinated probably get even worse now. Brussels people need covid pass go restaurants, they'll come over.

I live Malta saw exact thing happen earlier year. beginning summer nearly 0 cases, 80% eligible population vaccinated. let tourists - either vaccine certificate negative PCR test. local cases skyrocketed. authorities decided allow vaccinated people fly in. cases dropped immediately dropping ever since. almost local restrictions, mostly masks closed spaces. constant influx unvaccinated really made difference. Italy here.

75% entire population fully vaxxed, cases deaths flat declining. measures gone, basic ones still enforced.

Thia virus fucking weird. invite everyone ball room sunday guest super spreader. know happened people? find new work?  still restrictions/mask mandates? got joke even :) civilian much dangerous cop. last time saw cop kill cop?  i’m headed london tomorrow professional trip. cases high UK right now, wondering feel there? events coming include drinks food connections. lots outdoor opportunities work current weather? everything moved indoors?

2 things bad time. Covid death : -27%
Windows death : +7358965% countries covid cases deaths underreported, especially beginning. countries blame covid cases deaths pulmonary diseases, countries count deaths covid underlying condition. epidemiologists recommend multiply number symptomless cases 5 deaths 2-3. horribly sad number, considering community outreach vaccination largely left pharmacies volume voluntary groups.

 Individual pharmacies' publications limited signs outside establishments, online websites. Community volunteers much money set temporary tents offer vaccination information. 

Television presence limited, too. occasional celebrity appeared 15 seconds, imploring viewers ""get shot"". 

An occasional 15 second advertisement social media platforms plain blue background white font simply asked us ""get shot stop spread"". boring get? 

A concerted effort raise awareness needed, fulfilled. concerts shot?! One two area (75 miles away) advertised free shots upon entry. concerts TV, songs people ventilators, families one left support them, whole communities deviated? 

Where roadside billboards depicting celebs getting shots? bus bench advertising non-existent, none seen local buses plastered people's heads. 

I get occasional request clinic (Florida) booster shot. seems aware walk *any* pharmacy ask shot. pharmacy stock shot want? Go online smartphone use preorder takeout Google shot want. one aware this? 

The telephone numbers originally (and still advertised) state health department lead waiting hours get message eventually someone pick phone. cases, caller hangs without getting info they're looking for. still know CDC website, think kind ""big government evil entity"", avoid it. know number local health department. result, never find information should, fall Facebook - someone always lurking, willing spread disinformation. 

Our government local health departments failed utterly educating general public vaccinations available, safety, need social health. terrible shame. loss 90,000 lives result poor advertising. trick finding inevitable isn't. uni student wasted lot veggies supermarket small bags sale, often could finish bag bought went bad. avoidable problem. idea much vaccine waste avoidable we'd better study it.

That said, getting boosters millions millions Americans Westerners want rob lower-income countries doses, using doses would wasted anyway.

Pharmaceutical companies stand make billions convince richer nations keep buying doses instead sell lower income countries instead. I'm even tinfoil hat kind guy Big Pharma thing deeply, deeply corrupt. produce lot good things - obviously - would take studies bucket salt look global picture. politician west may well buy third doses get *spread* even save lives. Numbers great! demand lower income countries get chance buy doses need protect old vulnerable.

The problem situation uncertain. know, that's nobody's fault; enough data. people addicted Covid? Much easier get vaccination quit smoking cigarettes.   doctor determine vaccine? run tests?

It seems like data showing 2 million blood clots within weeks jab coincides existing average total population.

This means got blood clot probably something vaccine, coincidental timing.

I would really consider getting blood tests done already try find underlying issue. Strokes joke. There’s probably story. We’ve seen plenty people got fired ‘missing one day work’ already last step attendance policy workplace It’s crazy think people throw livelihoods away can’t even explain detailed think vaccine dangerous.

Yeah, early whispers online, like ""mystery flu"" ""unknown illness"", seemed like folks collapsing public unknown (at time) reasons. know anyone guess, think 2nd 3rd+ booster shots going thing?

Got third dose September, planning vacation sometime next spring... debating plan around getting another booster March-ish (assuming 2 weeks post-vax would optimum time transcontinental flight cruise)  You’re wishing deaths humans. terrible thing say. one that. vaccines reduce chances catching Covid research indicates breakthrough cases less likely spread well. 

No vaccine 100% effective individual basis. Even polio vaccine breakthrough cases. father one. strength comes high percentage population getting vaccine.  That's like saying choice kill someone, deal consequences going jail. mean, strictly technically may right, good argument think is... wonder case study deal future respiratory pandemics. 

[It's strict cultures like South Korea (and major Asian countries) tend abide rules act communally, loose cultures like USA... tend to.

South Koreans wear high-PFE respirators (KF94) literally everywhere outside homes generally follow rules. also 77% **entire population** least one dose started way later US. 

America full fat lards think masks gay COVID government conspiracy. Many ones wear masks wearing useless cloth security blankies. US vaccination rate stalling paltry 66% population.  mix approved vaccines  It‘s likely FDA lower age 40 EUA boosters anyone, 18-39 risk severe disease. data Israel presented last week showing benefit booster age 40 now.  Vermont first state least 70 percent population fully vaccinated. 

While population(or lack thereof) plays role, clearly, factor either. Great job, Vermont! FDA granted EUA [oral swab-based antibody back June. find particularly interesting compelling detect IgA antibodies saliva. However, cannot seem find information whatsoever available. point-of-care test available order use home. anyone involved medical industry know find this? one would call find information? Searching “oral swab covid antibody test” shows news articles particular test. Clinical versus laboratory data. problem is: wait J &amp; J booster, cross vaccinate. prefer stay away MRNA fear may lose out. others said: People wanted ""one done"". 

So glad opted wait got Moderna. wanted Pfizer, took thought might second best. Turns Moderna appropriate working clinic. Luck draw, though. 

We count Delta. know long *any* vaccines would last. many tough decision make. complicates vaccination effort. *sigh*  arguments make vaccine ALSO apply COVID.

They say know long term effects vaccine. know long term effects COVID either!

This happens 50% population scientifically illiterate true. family among first get ***because actively searching it***. people knew idea available weeks months later, assuming someone would tap shoulder point tell time. mess. We're debate people like family ended stuck first thing could get, CDC FDA refuse properly support people position.

I think J&amp;J great, I'd go far say A-tier vaccine mRNA ones tier. federal level, there's complete refusal week want admit difference vaccines, coupled bias making recommendations less data. told get vaccine could time, became clear vaccine performing well, efforts made fix that. worst example immunocompromised people J&amp;J still allowed get boosters today, whereas immunocompromised people Pfizer Moderna month two now, despite vaccines performing better pretty much every piece data made public.

And now, even finally acknowledging drawbacks J&amp;J, repeating exact failure. Early studies indicate even second dose J&amp;J leave people take worse position mixing. Even many members FDA panel acknowledge this. understand new data time look over. However, ended meeting without agreed upon date deal topic. people like refuse put back situation we've last half year taking second J&amp;J dose, left hanging without indication consider letting us mix vaccines.

The problem J&amp;J, problem government's failure adjust situation allow EUAs us uncomfortable current protection proactively fix that. told get first vaccine offered us, definitively shown bad idea. result, next pandemic national emergency, people less likely listen experts' advice believe optimal instead. 100% truth here. free vaccine heart attacks?  Getting vaccinated protects you. risk severe illness covid increases sharply BMI. overweight, right, get booster. love sudden folks care medical freedom complying.   all! healthcare comment sections always pathetic. ""being cop dangerous make way"" glad thinking small minority loud online voices country disagrees it. boat, feel like j&amp;j left 99% reporting vaccines, point see article “vaccines” assume it’s Pfizer/moderna j&amp;j. It’s honestly fucking frustrating, even news day’s worth updates confusing. going get booster now? still approvals need happen first? shot need? amnesia, selective memory. Or, rather, selective attention.

Quite frankly, pay attention said interests 'validates' beliefs. 56% Italians supports vaccine mandate description inaccurate. understand hard accept world filled idiots problem exclusive US. No-one says antivaxxers US ""a thousand loud protestors"".

Source:  Since reddit soooooooooooooooooo proactive stopping disinformation.

HCA invaluable sub, since making people get vaccinated, even reddit tried hobble HCA.  already have. they're young, got sick recovered. proves covid overblown recovered fine. hey careful man, Reddit can't rational fair opinions toward anything related Police Officers! dont know lol. saw Fauci talking tried posting article removed.  would 3 doses.. Lol downvoted? That’s legitimate question ask/ concerned about… Yeah, bunch pricks want protest two life saving pricks arm.   Herman handlers that's HCA created, really trash dead, wake living, potential awardees.  I’m really sorry hear they’re likely get covid. sucks sucks treating you. right thing getting vaccinated trying tell simple medical guidance. think make sense it. First, hearing J&amp;J slightly less effective probably incorrect light recent data. data gotten week shows preventing infections pretty much anymore, whereas Pfizer efficiency halved without boosters. bit extreme reports, newer data reports significantly large study. Still, data I've seen J&amp;J still really good death. gives?

The key understand body two main defense mechanisms: antibodies B/T cells. Antibodies immediate defense, whereas B cells slow heavy weapons. logically, infections spread tend antibodies, B cells slow anything that, whereas hospitalizations death B cells.

Keeping mind, points J&amp;J decent job B cells, terrible job antibodies. complicated situation different people different takes that, hear drastically different things. people FDA CDC seem believe antibodies useless focused hospitalization death aspect. medical degree cannot talk angle, math degree believe misses important tool toolbox: preventing spread. ever hear vaccinations protected polio measles keeping hospital. hear cut spread get first place! Even can't get COVID 0, cutting spread still significantly reduce infections, hospitalizations, deaths.

Another complication J&amp;J seem worse hospitalizations vaccines. There's couple possibilities here. One could worse B cells part well antibodies, alternative idea. suspect Delta hitting faster Alpha did, such, people getting hospitalized B cells time get full gear, preventing hospitalizations pushed towards antibodies preventing deaths still almost completely correlated B cells. personal gut feeling might going Yeah beginning played poorly. remember seeing boxes N95s construction supply store supervisor around time telling buy bunch. didn’t course gone two weeks.  choose smoke, quit smoking greatly reduce chances dying lung cancer smoking-related heart disease.

You choose get vaccinated greatly reduce chances dying Covid.

Both issues massive campaigns try sway people make right choice protect themselves. smoking unvaccinated people banned certain limited spaces.

In way, comparison makes sense. way think. don’t know empathetic. People can’t stupid, choose consequences knows? thread cut.  good like saying Clayton Kershaw good Max Scherzer. tell us 2/3 force died covid 2/3 subset died passed covid.

Inexplicable downvotes always threads, thanks helpful reply! social cost wearing mask absolutely miniscule compared alternative middle pandemic.

You're strawmanning point. US donatimg millions doses help already sort redundant going cause death died clarifies 2/3 officers die. current title intentionally ambiguous. Delta Platinum  Speaking covid really flu. Ok, let's go ( even though but). come worst flu season 20 years, saw believe 80k deaths. Yet covid still go 1 year like 500k+, 700k+ current US. 500k died flu one year y'all all, 🤷🏻‍♂️ Delta Plus? What’s next, Delta Pro Max? Losing 1% population single cause quite high.

Here stats top causes death:
  Heart disease: 659,000
  Cancer: 599,000
  Accidents (unintentional injuries): 173,000
  Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 157,000

Total, without covid, ~2,854,000 per year.

The new 3.3 million covid deaths would (more often not) addition would bring average lifespan considerably. USA already unusually short lifespan compared developed countries; shorter rarely means better. think major part problem situation don’t feel trust experts know talking about. don’t knowledge things, trust people/corporations know helluvalot release product convey message properly.

They obviously make mistakes, point trust lot products life without overthinking nearly much probably overthinking vaccine skepticism.

Given history vaccines, odds insanely heavily favor everything fine. keep reading second dose difficulty comes producing large quantities, first dose. idea difference two would explain differences production.

And matter ingenious say design is, admit pandemic vaccines need mass produced flaw two different doses. one type dose allows everyone everywhere get vaccination campaign, even half deliveries fall flat. Sputnik design, first doses become almost worthless long second doses no-show.

So advantages design mention might good thing vaccine routinely administered lower numbers (to travellers, instance), pandemic scenario advantages IMO outweighed disadvantages. wouldn’t let JnJ completely hook here. must known second dose matching efficacy RNA. added ENSEMBLE 2 look close year.  still approvals need happen first? shot need?

There still approvals need happen first. four steps (FDA commission, FDA head, CDC commission, CDC head) need happen first has. three likely happen within week half.

However, shot need question tricky. small study came mere days ago suggest even second J&amp;J get unboosted Pfizer, whereas Pfizer Moderna top J&amp;J get level boosted Pfizer. However, FDA even date vote mixed boosters, decide wait mRNA boosters allowed, waiting indefinite amount time unprotected infection. us response problematic indeed, country(peru) highest mortality rate(Almost double second highest). Among usual blunders(like listening mask wearing) also unique set bewildering fails. Massive undercounting deaths(1/3x) hospitals oxygen year government nothing it, people dancing reggaetón top deceased en masse maskless, president co presenting saviors secretly vaccinating family members experimental Chinese vaccines, extremely strict quarantine nobody followed wast enforced anyway, using antibodies fast tests pcr tests, endless parties year long, many more. Meanwhile korea seems taken seriously, early investigations virus transmission pretty good, also Koreans tv almost everyone perfect mask fit. remember nyt piece showing head Korean CDC confused modeled exactly us one, maybe Asian mindset contributed somewhat also followed science took whole thing seriously, think much contribution. link sources everything said later tired atm. :p  Well better give vaccines nations like Ukraine Haiti, barely doses? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer Health Dr. Catherine Elliott reports 10 new confirmed cases COVID-19 noon Wednesday, October 13, noon Friday, October 15. number active cases currently 63. Two people COVID-19 hospital. 

Two people.  2 J&amp;J’s roughly equal 3 Pfizer / Moderna’s think well. seem low vaccine hesitancy. Thank Goodness. let’s make mandate student loan forgiveness next!! 😇  Dr. Gottlieb concerned Delta Plus become major problem, especially UK. He’s even worried immune escape happening, would explain persistently high case numbers there: alarmist, listen speaks. least start mentally preparing Wave 5 mid-winter. Nah. don’t get
Credit
Here  agree fully. Speed highest priority. tinkering variables focus. still lockdown? What’s vaxxed percentage? Ahh yes, anti-vaxers talking circles again. One thing always count totally contradicting trying prove point! Oh god. looked apparently thing now. ""Sigma Males vs Alpha Males"". Maybe ""Indigo Children"" microwaved hot pocket takes.

Thanks clarification tho. better approach countries? Im sure angle since made statement quality measures implemented. argue someone screen name ""cumguzzlingliar"" ??  Dr. Gottlieb seems think Delta Plus become major problem. It’s grown exponentially UK last couple weeks. He’s even going far saying immune escape could play, hardly alarmist.

Don’t get complacent yet. People clamoring AZ. early data production schedule super demand. kept dropping ball mRNA data came in.  Good disagree somebody claimed death meaningful measure. risk family members would gotten vaccinated weren’t J&amp;J insisted 1 shot. NYC also sending vans 1 shot door door elder and/or homeless order vaccinate them.

Also, see lot people saying 2 shots J&amp;J still bad...but last saw waited months between, isn’t efficacy par Pfizer Moderna, least close? thats J n J infection right? 

I think worth noting current vaccines worst least adapted ever covid. Thats pretty amazing since really good. trust science scientists work well, despite doomish headlines. I’m vaccinated concern like meds released public 3+ years later, see tv ads lawyers “if took blah blah, may entitled compensation”. know meds vaccines completely different vaccine roles time see ads ‘Zantac causes cancer that’s pulled shelves’, taking 15+ years, it’ll make bit skeptical. 

But got vax like traveling outside US idea long lockdowns vaccine requirements gonna around goal ICU due Covid, measure indefinite, hard lockdown.  doesn’t happen 3 years, they’ll make 6 years. 10 years. ancient civilization predicted massive collapse Jesus’ face toasted someone’s bread one time. Oh Jews caused Covid financial gain Trump anti-anti-Christ. mention dolphin people destroyed Atlantis causing chain events leading black man becoming president thus damning country true conservative values restored.

Goddamn nut jobs, lot them. think argument bit flawed. eating liver dinner plate isn’t going feed starving kid China like mother claimed. Similarly, it’s simple booster given equals first dose given Eritrea. 

We both. vaccinate world *and* give boosters. make billions doses year now. equity important, it’s not, humble opinion, reason stop boosters. multiple coronavirus vaccine platforms. I’d surprised medical condition person could protein based, adenovirus based, rna based coronavirus vaccine. 

The RNA vaccines seem especially good fit people severe multiple allergies. One would think allergy RNA would incompatible life. lipid layer also particularly allergenic compared protein based vaccines. US, people react RNA vaccines told use JnJ second dose. even people adverse reaction RNA based vaccines option.

I’m JnJ trial told boosters available day (this September) would recommend get RNA vaccine medical condition have. JnJ never published safety signal saw (it one event) probably unrelated vaccine guidance would probably different today. 

I’m mentioning example emphasize many doctors would jump don’t get vaccinated you’ve ever vaccine reaction.  Instead guidance typically, let’s try different type vaccine. 

I also used childhood egg allergy example another response. H1N1 happened 2009 - lot kids egg allergies whose parents suddenly decided could try egg allergy vaccine protocol allergists recommending years. Despite egg allergy kids got vaccinated H1N1.  I’m mentioning emphasize protocols allow people vaccinated - even situation could described complicated. There’s small time Q anon grifter follow fully board belief 3 years every single person got covid shot going die. posts vaccines false it’s almost laughable. time 50-100 comments say “oh true! storm coming!” they’re mostly older people. It’s unbelievable.   90K+ families bring class action lawsuits gov. officials needed public safety? think really mixed messaging here. virus that’s dangerous need disruption daily lives mask mandates yet time trivial breakthrough infections don’t matter…except still isolate ten days. understand public frustration think it’s time real discussion go virus well way endemic.

That said, boosters simply “all good bad.” know mRNA vaccines significant side-effect profile merely inconvenience people, significant portion people needed take beds day two (and missing day work issue people) rare myocarditis cases. think needs balanced real benefit booster reducing breakthrough cases transmission.

My guess long term, we’ll find two doses given four six months apart work well 0,1,6 schedule currently proposed. However, remember year ago today vaccines first top-line results hadn’t even announced yet. hurry made perfect sense try space first two doses closely together possible.

As healthcare worker, I’m scheduled get booster three weeks (I got Regeneron infusion early August wait 90 days that), think gather data booster side-effects recommending general public.

There good news: [Israel reported fewer-than expected myocarditis cases booster may data soon support broadening recommendation. Thank you! play, never care completing, never scores grades trophies that. seems work fine, barely production it.

Also, take look [daily administered doses (from Everyone (age 12+) wants get vaccinated (66% population) already done pretty much.

There's also breakdown vaccines used scroll site, 131 mil total doses, 88 mil biontech, 13 mil moderna, 25 mil AZ, 4 mil J&amp;J.

Vaccine supply issue since June least, thing lacking willing arms.  getting downvotes Preventable *by vaccine* fully agree. longer whole thing continues damaging collective mental health. I'm glad kids school masks remote. prefer going back office part time masks vs fully remote. much like wearing sweatpants time, nice see people. Anecdotal bullshit still anecdotal bullshit. Facts prove making shit up.

And I'm wasting time someone spreading pro-plague rumors. social cost negligible compared alternative getting sick enough end ICU. please direct somewhere else there’s better place asking this.

Seems like doctor would ideal. see people saying none vaccines particularly good cases gone zero yet. mean boosters even high demand supports argument FDA/CDC approve boosters adults. could approve right guarantee wouldn’t cause vaccine distribution logjam time allowing want extra protection get third dose.  There's reason believe 6 months even annual shots continue past point covid rampant. There's strong T/B cell response continues protect severe disease death, booster likely strengthen point needed. covid still massive presence, makes sense worry antibody levels, covid becomes rare, doesn't. talk needling lifelong boosters every 6 months ridiculous hyperbole. restrain myself. [Brain brain, It’s same. based anti-gay hatred. data completely different time period (during surge j&amp;j), would obviously show lower efficacy rates Moderna/Pfizer. harming healthcare system everyone else keeping levels infection high, harmful everyone.  imagine delta hit us vaccines came out?  *Navy prepares dishonorably discharge seamen measures vaccines, June substantial percent population vaccinated. it. go back. done masks, distancing measure. it’s like New York, already information. calling system. mean already get pin cushion treatment don’t understand one vaccine hill want die on. thinking, set vaccination clinic school. mail notices release forms out. like schools stuff like already. Oh no, unvaccinated areas still going hotspots.  rate consequence/cost losing job, career position something casual. serious stick increase compliance.

Sorta random lot people getting conjunctivitis recently? know 3 people havent contact either getting it. I'm honestly wondering covid.   it’s required.

He’s good source. Lots places still require masks. Newsflash: unvaccinated people don’t wear masks unless everyone required wear mask. store says “unvaccinated people required wear masks,” won’t wear one checks. would love give third world countries broccoli i've never eaten haiti ability store vaccines? get arms expiration date? willing arms put in?

i honestly know answers questions mean boosters even high demand supports argument FDA/CDC approve boosters adults. 

are high demand? iirc 7 million pfizer boosters given, would couple million week, hundred thousand per day....that's huge percent doses giving right Ex girlfriend French got vaccine US visiting me. needs vaccine qr code anything country US vaccine card. anyway somehow record transferred get qr code? No. It’s recommended. hours ask doctor need sooner. 1 ~ 3.600 people believe countries created equal regard? mean sound pedantic likely comes out, let explain.

what country send vaccines first? countries highest population density? ones lowest uptake? ones best infrastructure get vaccines arms? split evenly among nations? sent allies? I'm Quebec, resistance health measures here.
I'd suggest following basic health recommendations, wearing masks public spaces possible (grocery stores, retail stores, cinemas, etc.) .
Vaccination passports appear effective arguably soon tell without data.
Better ventilation schools workplaces. Stricter requirements border.
I can't tell effective I'm expert. :)
Even requirements, people going day day life without freaking out. I've going bars restaurants unmasked vaxxed fun, I'm someone super cautious vaccinated.
Honestly, people can't follow basic guidelines behaving like selfish children, even 18 months.  Among uneducated. people voting this. People need get vaccinated arent saving everyone. truth FDA CDC follow Fauci's reasoning, mean 15 million people got J&amp;J retroactively going declared partially vaccinated, lost rights come fully vaccinated status? anyone think realistic possibility? want get shot. Also benefits second dose pretty iffy actually collected data. adenoviral vectors there's risk ""vector immunity""--basically become immune vaccine second dose can't really boost response COVID.

Luckily turned major issue something people thinking about. Sputnik used different formulations first second dose specifically avoid this. thing gets is… understand refusing accept anything without questioning it. Coming nonsense spout possible explanation. Shows creative thinking. go around treat fact. don’t get it. know made up.  mean, they're already expected boosters 80%+ people 6 months out. given criteria like "" want work people"" ""former smoker"", basically 100% adults allowed get since way check those. So, would suggest? live? Thank FUCKING GOD would add video something. 
\* vaccination campaign prioritize elders, cases politicians cheated got vaccinated turn queue. cases got attention media perceived population vaccine good them. 
\* Portuguese brothers even higher vaccination rate Spain. Kudos  
for them. both?

Anecdotally, four family members got J&amp;J didn’t trust mRNA tech. 

But also saw plenty friends acquaintances Facebook timeline crying foul J&amp;J paused caution. 3 weeks ensure people fully immunised quickly possible. 

Coverage isn’t uniform across country it’s highest Auckland outbreak is. Right hard border around Auckland essential services allowed through.

This containing spread buy time rest country raise vaccination rates.  vaccinated people suffering choice someone supermarket vaccine far good (knock wood).

Edit: spelling I'm sorry assuming matter simply developed world privileged mindset. Covid discriminate, yes neither cancer. runs family. difference outbreak people dying left right getting cancer people, cant compare apples oranges here. Fuck Covid

Fuck Cancer

Fuck Florida still feel bad people suffering loved ones learn (if all) suffering watching loved ones suffer that's going go.  Cancer covid. Covid unprecedented biological outbreak.

Ok. alive well now? likely die auto accident way get vaccine vaccine.  study fails account fact can't prevent stupid! Hard change mind dead. Probably vaccine. overall positive percentage 0.6%, absolutely nuts. College worth nearly everyone. 

The data college ROI clear. bachelor’s pays nearly everyone opens door much higher paying degrees jobs.   I'm glad live US, that's selfish mindset. virus never going away. It’s never ever getting sick. It’s bringing risk point move on.  Shedding vaccine? I'd love able that, spread immunity everywhere went! zero, would lot better 100% uptake. local hospital chain 500 covid patients point near peak. time 5 unvaccinated. everyone vaccinated nurses could play minesweeper something instead 7x12s ICU.

Get rid them. It’s high end democratic society accept, grave scenarios. support mandates, I’m happy it.  Unfortunately many people (even vaccinated) don’t seem give damn anymore. think invincible covid longer really thing. Breakthrough infections still exist, virus still mutate. people seem care breakthrough infections, even though people hospitalized them. many unknowns still virus. STOP RESISTING!

Given talking anecdotally getting sick compared unvaccinated colleagues think statement perfectly valid. state's laws require healthcare workers show proof vaccination. I'm sure that's great comfort family. know talking 0% daughter's kindergarten.  many times 9 employees team able get work done operate efficiently team 10 employees, 1 10 bad apple.

It’s worth mentioning majority responsible people pro-vaccine, small, loud minority getting much attention is. Especially considering 1% job loss greatly minimizes people get covid work two weeks (probably works similar percentage missing staff undervaccinated workforce) part policy prevent overcrowding hospitals (which causes strain missing 1% workers) Putin wants get it??? Exactly. Mandates things improve life everyone prevent horrible disasters. 

If Biden mandates something like convert catholicism, arbitrary unhelpful demand, bring torches pitchforks justified resistance.

But plague killed americans world war 2 less 2 full years. massivly disrupted economy, safety, day day life. way stops issue enough population gets disease vaccinated drop threat level. novel disease real resistance nativly. Since medical system economy cannot handle 333 million americans getting years, alternative vaccinate everyone can.

Since partisan bullshit misinformation campaigns made sizable portion population react negatively acceptable solution, mandate it.

But maybe I'm idealistic. want believe people foolish unreachable intellectually stop ignoring science make shit up. dangerous  Try different one say id. vaccinating homeless questions asked without id.  big nose surgical ones don’t fit well. gaps top air escapes, therefore they’re working effectively.

Congress mandate, would impose themselves. Biden federal mandate extend them, impose branch either got rid smart people ppl left outsource much. can’t deliver anything. leftover idiots. Headlines really misleading here.

If Pfizer 6mo ago 2nd shot, are:

-65+ long term care residents get booster

-50-64 underlying health conditions get booster

-18-49 underlying health conditions MAY get booster, based individual risk assessment (no doctor's note needed)

-18-64 high occupational exposure risk MAY get booster.

""Underlying health conditions"" includes 74% adult population based BMI alone (since overweight BMI, obese), goes include high blood pressure, current/former smoker, substance use, diabetes, asthma, among others.

People risk due job includes healthcare workers, teachers, first responders, grocery store workers... anyone working public close quarters many others. Also institutional settings, e.g. prisoners.

So damn near everyone qualify one way another.

And (and currently Moderna), people immunocompromised could get one.

It's self-attestation too. say meet one conditions, prove it. individual pharmacists breaking CDC guidelines dicks proof, aren't.

Also people lying first shot. Databases state state, places even check, places require ID.   health network I’m getting medical care pregnancy lost half staff it’s shit show.

But, call light, alarm, someone comes ask help, even patient, even things could doing, could charting, up. go help. experience good unit one nurses mentality ""my problems assigned patients.""

Thats solid advice, except give us 2 weeks quarantine period? Apparently getting vaccinated good enough remove social support anyone gets it, vaccinated not. Hundreds millions people gotten vaccines fine, something like 98% doctors chosen vaccinated, people who've Covid gotten vaccinated become super immune. unlikely we'll need boosters every six months—maybe like every ten years. Since already Covid, reinfection probably kill you, might make feel really crappy disrupt life ways, there's really logical reason go super-immunity option. Alternatively, maybe wait tried-and-true vaccine technology Novavax. :) Oh changed now. probably die covid get vaccinated. Thats it. still get sick dog still spread viral load. often look overall vaccination rate consider heterogeneity. pockets society unvaccinated, Delta going spread rapidly them. I’ve multiple workplaces multiple states require get blood tested Hep b get vaccinated Hep b get terminated. either happened live 2 unusual states incorrect.

Bullying works? guess.     sperm count, also called *oligozoospermia*,** man fewer 15 million sperm per millilitre semen. low sperm count make difficult conceive naturally, although successful pregnancies still occur.

In case anyone needs know because, like me, thought covid dude's oligozoospermia.    Hindsight always 20/20. went knew time. Whatever turns boosters important part got vaccinated pandemic height protecting others. rhetorical question. Obviously answer no. 

The question asked suggest large part ""Boeing workers"" actually Boeing workers, type people who'd like show types protests. You’re going need break small business bit since it’s third numbers. 

Healthcare close 20% US economy - I’d guess it’s nontrivial part workforce. None based science. even CDC says that. clearly said vaccinated people ditch masks. spread concern children, children gone back school. Actually vaccinated people around half chance getting long covid unvaccinated do. 

That still high! planes manufactured South Carolina actually! I’ve heard quality Boeing manufacturing much lower work traditionally done Washington.   Including civil war, approximately 667k combat deaths US Revolution Afghanistan. think that’s he’s talking about. Kids can't get vaxxed soon enough! Kids able get vaccinated primary reason lot vaccinated folks (even without kids) still bothering wear masks tolerate inconvenient public safety measures. kids get vaccine enough time passed get jabbed, mark limit many, terms willingness put lives hold others. need kids vaxxed, say we've done reasonably get this. Muh long Covid Millennials pushing 40 college. No. Vaccines make managable disease. Vaccines let us treat like annual flu virus disruption is.

There short window early vaccine could squashed sars-cov2 vaccinated whole planet quickly enough, never infrastructure cooperation happen ship sailed.

Now, push vaccinate make something still exists, still harmful, level manage. Currently case casualty (quarantining, sick leave, hospitalization, death) rates high enough covid shutting economies crushing hospitals. goal vaccination least drop casualty rates low enough society operate per normal. may still kill injure several times many people flu every year, gives us time build infrastructure make therapies deal it. Hopefully get good enough treatment becomes another cold flu. arent yet.

Anyone says vaccines permanently fix covid missing hints, deluding themselves, selling something.

Saying vaccines worth also stupid, current fatality hospitalization rates spread 333 million americans, without boost vaccinations, looking millions americans dying tens millions hospitalized everyone ONCE. would continue every year every variant disease naturally evolves less harmful variant develop enough immunity render harmless. Historic pandemics novel, fast spreading diseases like covid taken years decades resolve naturally. 

Waiting nature take course dumb accessible alternative cutoff disease. wont stop it, hinder it. importantly, vaccines massivly reduce damage does. Kinda shit right? spread virus vaccinated. It’s regular Colgate Peroxyl bottle get store. Nothing special. Yes, exactly. published (and known early 2020 person responded suggested, year recovery then).  That's works all.

Thank you! feel like I’m losing mind sometimes talking people it’s “blowback” we’re seeing US, bunch people say quit getting vaccine, tiny percentage actually follow through. turn Wild West.

US donated lot vaccines hoarded get needed.  Unless rinse mouthwash water something, go away second spit out. gonna keep killing stuff several hours. Plenty time go store wherever need go get back. gonna stop getting it, asymptomatic yet symptomatic, could help prevent giving others. Let’s see references claims cause I’m calling bullshit. Advocating people sufficient levels antibodies get vaccinated led people getting adverse reactions, even dying, didnt need to. I’m fully board defunding police holding accountable actions, wouldn’t go far say jobs safe. dispatched dangerous situations regularly. don’t care lol. issue country. Far many people caring *their* personal risk. see many people shrugging virus like it’s big deal anymore.

Everyone needs part. right, wearing mask much ask all. Leave anti-vaxxers shut left behind. choice, consequences. sane people damn well weather getting without them. invincible. covid either. vaccinated puts one low risk serious outcomes covid. covid well within risk everyday activities. choose live life normally accept risk. calculation may different choose accordingly.  could imagine keeping reservoir infection among kids would end negatively effecting older even they've vaccine. almost like contagious disease kids petri dishes  understand reasoning. would really difficult. Presumably case numbers low enough would good time get rid masks, area 10% population covid doesn’t get now? Reinfections occur. people feel invcincible simply vaccinated? Covid still threat everyone, regardless vaccination status regardless whether immunocompromised.

The long term impact breakthrough infections unknown point. Plenty breakthrough infections long-haulers well. It’s deaths…COVID disabled people. pandemic over. large portion US population vaccinated, doesn’t make so. ya go, it’s [study you’ve waiting 

TL;DR - Mixing safe, probably experience side effect (like chills, fever, headache, fatigue). Exactly. care causes vaccinate. want get vaccinated pandemic end.  people think restaurant food workers require vaccines? small number local jurisdictions case.

And states laws require healthcare workers vaccinated. discharge hospitals let buy dewormer themselves. go vets suffer side effects. fair point, police danger general public recent phenomenon.  got vaccinated second eligible. super excited it. Told everyone. regret decision. Every single time breakthrough case get mocked it. Every time mention need booster get mocked it. Every time anyone mentions vaccinated people hospital get mocked it. Meanwhile non-vaccinated family members give crap. get exposed Tuesday evening, get tested Wed morning since negative go life normal. frustrating. effective affordable available vaccine… Anecdotes align this. Two guys pharmacy got shot keep jobs flu shot. Heard refrain. Whatever works point. gotta get herd immunity-ish hump. work hospital, one coworkers quit rather get vaccine. get it. Democrats congress 100% vaccination rate. don’t know Republicans independents, I’m sure it’s way higher would like admit is. Even #45 got either way emergency rooms fucked, great don’t think fire many once. interesting see go it. didnt say that. think anybody happy COVID :), I'd much rather live society people reasonable want help common good, mandates necessary. 

I think vaccination mandates well within limits democratic society accept, especially way federal mandates made USA; nobody going jail vaccinated ... won’t unless people replace near future. Chicago turn Wild West. Yeah idea many would actually get third shot. 100 million 30% population, though.

Honestly frustrating thing makes sense give third doses ""slowly"" maintain steady dose pharmacies minimize trashed doses, also exporting first doses Africa far valuable overall. point there's going change science policy going reversed one day want use doses locally, going another instance public policy trying right thing lying reasons.

There's local (rural) vaccine clinic Tuesday. It'll 6.5 months since last dose, low exposure risk although county 30% vaccinated. I'm leaning strongly toward third dose. **Oct. 17, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Honestly, think order first society anyway... understand people would want go stores first place. horrible places, never find anything get lost sections. ordering years now. time money wasted go store pointless activity. misleading multiple reasons:

1. title says *unvaccinated people* covid recovered people may unvaccinated. would create outrage also excluded. 

2. first thought pop many people's heads reading thread wording ""can"" means would happen lot frequently would seem actually read article.

It's misleading many people interpret outrageous really is. Listen mother get booster. spouse didn't. 13 days post booster husband got sick. fully vaxxed finishing (hopefully) ROUGH bout Covid. mild. hoping booster holds run stress taking care worrying. weight reason enough get booster. technically lied get mine regret seeing sick husband got. scary. Even booster minimizes severity genuinely mild illness worth it. opinion booster recommended everyone.   too. I'm lucky surrounded somewhat caring people slightly left leaning society contrast jarring. read comments they're utterly selfish ignorant actually happening. thing sure hell much anyone wishes was. Northwest Territories (NWT) Canada similar experience, fast out-of-the-gate vaccinate population, around 90% eligible people vaccinated, yet currently highest number active Covid cases (per capita) Canada. Health authorities suspect waning immunity one reasons rolling booster shots — well warning parts Canada get boosters ASAP cases pick again. consider idiots refused vaccine? wondering much weeding bad employees. said fat. risk factor Covid. Even risk factors doesn‘t really matter. 

Here Germany BMI 40 considered high risk even BMI 30 prioritized initial rollout. 

If please talk doctor reach closest vaccination point. able tell currently prioritized booster. ""this"" they're talking job losses. Surely vaccination status isn’t grounds discrimination.

Pregnancy, religion, cultural groups etc are, vaccination status outside legitimate medical exemptions. be. Note Hesse ruling restaurants bars use ""2G"" (only allowing vaccinated people prove recovered covid past six months), used rule instead also letting guests negative test, enforce masking distancing rules.

So shop owner want exclude vaccinated people sake it. wanted abolish covid restrictions shop using ""2G"".

Most shops joining that, especially supermarkets, though they're legally allowed to. people leaving mandate typically around 100-200 people workforce 20-30,000, less percentage staff.

It would surprise lot “nurses” posted TikTok videos getting fired actually legitimate nurses instead agitators buying scrubs playing dress-up, protests mandatory vaccination construction workers Victoria, Australia, apparently small group legitimate construction workers rest anti-vaxx protesters bought hi-vis Kmart morning protest.  Well think society give demands terrorists. Society best it. terrorists problem law enforcement agencies.

I'd hate live world good things happen mob morons might attack. lost fight MA, prison guards.  try local pharmacy? way relaxed. Exactly Many 90,000 probably still didn’t believe it. dont link data, recall 2020 russia showed surprisingly low covid deaths, massive surge pneumonia deaths.  trucked bozos wife got blood clot shortly getting vaccine taking blood thinners it. Never blood clot before. Vaccine blood clot inception watching old episode _Friends_ cause it? 🤔 Perhaps misunderstood something. I'm nervous parents. received Jensen vaccine March. really want Pfizer Moderna place allow get either booster Jensen booster even approved right now. infuriating. yo7 put dying staff someone help die comfortably? much ask?   didn’t think Janssen vaccine available UK yet, although approved. far tell, people UK receiving either Pfizer Moderna booster, regardless initial doses were. [Official booster information UK government here. already got covid

Depending covid severe, immunity also wane. Sadly, know person caught covid early on, lax getting vaccine (just priority b/c already covid), recently died second covid infection.  Last year go (state) driving school cause got ticket, instructor told us lost people car accidents causalities war. minutes later, proceeded tell us COVID hoax. wonder thinks this.   I’m favor cops lately mostly believe denial accountability, fundamental problems forces, “bad apples”, etc. 

However one thought statistic cop less dangerous many professions. wonder like airplane stat - ie overall life far likely die car crash plane crash, that’s volume. given time plane dangerous (at least risk death) driving car given time. 

So cop overall unlikely die line duty, encounter someone believe armed, likelihood far higher. 

Not saying changes anything given part cop’s duties correctly identify situations.  drinking makes people live longer So...8 years ago bad cop kills bad cops, remaining bad cops burn alive home. 
Still waiting ""good guy"" gun stop ""bad guy"" gun. America understanding. wanting know UK done/approved.  Yes mentioned Canadians could fly land border closed directions. reopen US side November 8 proof vaccination.

The rules entering US air different entering US land pandemic. looks like starting Nov. 8 identical. effective route real police reform? build planes??? Mayor win win city. covid kills cop replace vaccinated younger cops less pay
 Best part pensions paid. Smart. world get immunity easy way (vaccinations) Darwin's way. America, area both. Many Americans choosing Darwin's path dying pointless way imaginable. C'est la guerre.

Boosters big deal. get one recommended you. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Oh, see you’re saying. don’t understand either, unless still excommunicato 3-month mark.

Mostly cleaners admin staff would imagine. There’s official go-ahead J&amp;J boosters yet.  I’m England idea. probably research it. CDC studied 90,000 elementary students found layered mitigation strategies made real dent case rates, notably significant difference cases could attributed masks Everything becoming polarized. ""If us us."" Lots tribalism. mixed views anything seen ""fence riding"" frowned upon. Real weird situation we're in. covid friend's sepis got 4 years ago died from? asking expounding love say shit like ""I work healthcare and"" yeah uh secretary hospital ""working healthcare.""  amazing minority ends loud voice. Oh wait seems happen time. Squeeky wheels usually get grease. record fire thier asses. want anyone around healthcare understand vaxxed.

Got real news reports points? anyone stopping parents giving masks kids telling wear them? need government that?   job public safety refuse public safety measures...   know Cobra is. used it. I'm curious insurance got turned immediately. Cobra backdated 3 months could technically started immediately believe even require check start.  Beautiful rebuttal!

Lotteries known scam. Yet people play them. Nobody going jail get vaccine. Nobody held shot put arm. People getting vaccines put vans disappearing forever. concentration camps unvaccinated. no, crossed authoritarian yet.

There much makes direct comparison difficult though. Population densities, availability methods limit infection (not easy acquire masks, far improved ventilation general cleaning standards personal hygiene).

You're wrong think that's part problem. Covid killed like 350k people US 2020 that's less half heart disease honestly, nearly half cancer. lot people means big deal. Un-mitigated death toll probably would've topped cancer sure maybe even heart disease, people see that. really shame things went J&amp;J. originally going game changer was, ended negative creating hesitancy, etc. Expectations never went away us. We’re expected productive pre pandemic slowed down. want see punishment way treated. Shit posting afterlife. 80% already fully vaxxed need ? Surely enough keep virus control. 

I'm vaccine need draconian measures.  UK fucking stupid, bring back masks covid Rt decline 1.

Masks cost pennies save trillions.

I think every country ban travel UK doubt incubating dangerous variants unchecked spread.  Yeah that's asked. protest local hospital area none protesters actually employees. retired hospital rest people community. 2 things right time. Universities safe going get. Anybody claims still need measures insist totally aren’t advocating masking forever lying themselves. young people sick pandemic best thing get vaccinated keep masking up. lift restrictions pandemic lasts even longer.

Covids Rt trending way down. time stupidly remove mask mandates. US never learn it’s lesson? Vaccines also greatly reduce “other outcomes” Covid. lot *suppose* things world work take fact. idea cause thought WHO, CDC US government competent ready potential pandemic. chose misdirection instead. news started leaking China, told extended family buy n95s immediately - Guess what, told n95s sold everywhere...and Covid even reached US - proof enough something serious going on.   exercising getting better shape.

This magic pill prevent dying covid anything else. stupid people again. mental gymnastics astounding.

I'm country high vaccination rate completely normal. Apart traveling country places, single restriction. None. working. Vaccinations way out, everyone vaccinated, that's it, accept extra deaths per year, adjust health care coming years such. course vaccinated people invincible, still allow people drive despite car crashes injuring others.  originally got mocked saying US would getting 90,000 *cases*. back still 1000.  “It hasn’t long enough know long term effects” big argument hear.

Even though vaccine history humanity shown directly correlated side effects beyond 2 months so. It’s like putting ticking time bombs body one day get triggered nothing kill you. That’s works. Machoism finest, adequate results.  Try convince mom that, stays cloth masks, also washes whatever surgical PFF2 (the Brazilian equivalent European FFP2 US N95) masks here!  article COVID viral disease, women better immune systems men. also case influenza, yellow fever, dengue, several viruses.

The downside robust immunity 80 percent autoimmune disease patients women.

Although old article, science behind still delta. mindset never go back normal always going subset individuals cannot get vaccinated. scenario overwhelming majority people USA reject. Ergo isn’t going happen. People comorbidities need protect themselves. cannot asks hundreds millions people change lives protect them. feel like world Pfizer/Moderna even discussion whether J&amp;J hot garbage not. Everyone would thrilled it. Yet we're debate reason. They’re closed “in name Covid”, it’s save money. People quoting police deaths padding back proving ""safe"" job is.  extremely confused J&amp;J. heard may effective delta Pfizer/Moderna I've heard effective Pfizer/Moderna comes preventing deaths. comes preventing infections seems like slightly less effective terms number cases slightly. I'm also hearing J&amp;J utter garbage bit better saline solution. I'm confused. Hi everyone Italy! survived first days green pass mandate, everything worked fine, don’t need worried us!

I’m sorry experiencing this. Even though I’m well college, imagine isolating must you…all you.  Agreed. JJ vowed profit vaccine pandemic (can’t say Pfizer moderna). lower cost plus ease transport made JJ look like great option. Hasn’t worked way unfortunately.  Less variance since mid April. None zero weekend dip since summer (799 era). real change positive share tests, cases goes &amp; down, Little none correlation cases vs deaths since summer, flatten death curve. 


And. Last year 52k covid deaths, 362k excess deaths. None take Russia's numbers seriously. sad downplaying pandemic.

As understand, vaccine transmit shed since real virus, right? people really messed US now? head hurts reading stupidity. wonder pandemic still going on. unvaccinated sending children school, grocery shopping using local hospitals? forcing everyone around take risk. really wish *would* leave rest us alone that’s choice. Pfizer data Israel. shows 10-20-fold improvement third dose vs 2-dose cohorts age bracket; however, confounding factors demographics may fundamentally different exposure rates. also shows 5-fold improvement infection rates third-dosed versus several days dose, rising 10+ fold under-30s. 

[Moderna quite good, since phase 2s real world data. similar antibody titer boost seen &lt;65 age groups, starting antibody titers higher argument waiting longer. 

We still lack measurement cellular immunity boosting either vaccine dose. lack data US, course, though states hospital systems likely data within next month two. Since running trials pretty important give enough people - though necessarily everyone - third doses get real world data reasonable timeline.

The convincing evidence (though correlation always causation) generally case counts, spring. Israel's case counts. drop coincides exactly [giving third doses younger exactly correlation happened Alpha/wildtype first doses spring, everywhere world.  doubt it. useful crank billions next year I’m sure.

What limiting factor testing. One needs confirmed covid case take pill. can’t test pill. think **some** mental gymnastics coping defensive mechanism. big some. 

It's easier pretend problem real worry. 

Coping:

""It's flu, *scary* thing could kill me.""

Defensive: 

""It's flue, *scary* thing ignoring could cause kill others."" friend CNA says people deny covid they’re dying covid. feel exactly same.

Might well gotten COVID… far less protected got Pfizer moderna. 

A couple weeks later would’ve able get them. mentioned, essentially left behind nearly studies focusing moderna Pfizer since people got J&amp;J. 

Now I’m stuck limbo knowing getting another J&amp;J shot based reaction first lingering thought could go get booster 3 weeks later may okay mix/match would leave much protected, putting right back position first time. It’s 8 months since first shot. 

If won’t okay booster mrna shot now, point longer matter got J&amp;H go get 2 dose Pfizer moderna? That’s I’m things now. infectious Delta reason believe decline likely last.

In country like Portugal, even nearly 90% population vaccinated 80% effective vaccine, current low-ish level spread, still expect *thousands* cases week among vaccinated. means thousands people potentially going around infecting others. infectious variant even vaccinated person infect entire household group friends.

Make point.

Prove vaccinated protects person took like claimed.

You can't, false claim. Okay got Covid, gf caught me, many co workers (since work retail) covid vaccine, family members. list go I’m sure since don’t know anyone, doesn’t happen. Yeah, I've mentioned elsewhere. SK Asian populations simply wear masks regularly certain times year, wearing pandemic obvious. said far know. isn’t affirmation. 

I doubtful single medical condition would make someone unable vaccinated coronavirus vaccines since multiple types coronavirus vaccines. People options, especially Indonesia since I’ll bet access traditional platforms used Chinese, Astra Zeneca adenovirus vaccine, mRNA vaccines. 

So let’s say someone reaction coronavirus protein based vaccines - well two new platforms genomic based. Let’s say react adenovirus - well still leaves RNA platform. I’ll spell one interpret yelling - Far Know, human earth allergic RNA. One would think would incompatible life.

If look list linked reasons one might vaccinated specific vaccine (did look list?) main reason receive vaccine **previous reaction vaccine**. Additionally, guidance overwhelming number vaccines “don’t get vaccinated” guidance - talk doctor.

There protocols allow people history allergic reactions vaccine ingredient (e.g. children egg allergies) vaccinated vaccines contain ingredient allergic (e.g. egg proteins). 

I would truly surprised medical condition made someone incapable receiving coronavirus vaccines. Citation comparing Moderna? 

JJ+Moderna *did not* offer superior antibodies Moderna+Moderna recent NIH study, JJ+Pfizer offer improvement Pfizer+Pfizer, although closer edges 95% CI overlapped.  Sputnik solid design uses ingenious strategies designing vaccine needed developed hurry. using two different adenovirus serotypes, gets around issue anti-vector immunity encountered AZ J&amp;J.

The trouble Russian government seemed interested leveraging product advance international standing forgot actually need support technical requirements produce it. 

So are, developed *should been* excellent vaccine, unable actually produce it. We’ll probably never know exactly went wrong, I’m guessing Russian corruption played major role. Ironically, actually ideal vaccinated students, enables avoid exposure schools immunity reaches high potency. 

Checkmate, dipshits. Ok, protecting? vaccinated people? willingly unvaccinated? best answer everyone make risk assessment based situation take appropriate measures comfortable. me, precautions whatsoever. Care explain it? it’s overweight, beer drinking, chain smoking Americans COPD always saying “the unhealthy” people ones need it? This. J&amp;J still highly effective vaccine. Compare yearly flu shot looks like genuine miracle. Especially novel virus like Covid-19.  People happy Germany literally millions Moderna (and Pfizer) doses stock. don’t care Sputnik sure. know making shit. else need know? What? I'm vaccinated thus body able kill virus turn reduces amount time could infect......OTHER PEOPLE.  sure US whole, definitely messed Florida US UK still way higher cases per 100k many third world countries.

You really think poor countries lacking infrastructure testing capacity UK US? despite reddit hivemind, people going rush get 3rd dose, look many boosters given, even people risk wanting get booster. I'd put money less 100 million Americans zero comorbidities given barely 100 million Americans BMI &lt;25   Adenovirus vector vaccines still cutting edge too. There's two wide deployments pre-covid; oral rabies vaccine animals, Ebola vaccine used Africa. first couple months deployment alone provided safety data entire history covid combined. mRNA vaccines safety data point rollout combined.

They old technologies decades widescale use either. actually safety data mRNA widescale use. really making objective assessment here; hallmark antivaxxers.     Really thought covid morphed std  would say this? recommend booster move on. You’re bad messaging fauci. fucking heartless be. [56k Covid deaths 362k excess  remember arguing someone said would 1-2mil October 2020. there’s that.  There's evidence supposedly annual flu shots may lead worse intraseasonal protection. IE: someone gets first flu shot 5 years protect year someone gets flu shot every year. first person go 5 years without protection get slight extra protection 1 season. 

I read primary literature even know would considered experts field get opinion, seems like plausible problem. Basically, get vaccine slightly different previous year, neutralized immune system quickly immune system adapt subtle, important changes. virus changes lot, variant-specific booster would still effective (even protective someone went without previous years flu vaccines). 

I wonder problem part reason got variant specific boosters yet. Delta bad, Delta++ much much worse many people got Delta variant specific booster, may able benefit Delta++-specific booster. waiting VOHC instead trying boost surging VOC may good idea. probably know would never fulfill obligations. start trials last spring AstraZeneca second dose? introducing ""Sputnik Light"" (first dose sputnik V two doses) time?

Yes I’ve mine apple wallet months damn maybe shouldn’t told everyone J&amp;J effective two 7 months ago lot overweight people US don’t consider overweight they’re morbidly obese overweight common live. thus think “i’m totally healthy don’t need worry covid!” (even though, said, even false dichotomy) Honestly, think matters people they're convinced them. talk they'll tell every single one people fat shape number co-morbidities that's they're suffering. Meanwhile, super-fit shape eat proper diet they're perfectly healthy **know** covid would never harm them.    get 100 50? probably exclusive regions, one hit Delta like south east probably one.

Check IHME covid projections they've spot far. drug works really list essential medicines.  least symptoms lowest risk according SCIENCE.

1.) Low risk equal risk. seen even mild COVID cause long term damage.

2.) still infected spread others.

3.) Many children medically vulnerable people households.

So children statistically lowest risk severe COVID, control transmission spread MUST immunized ASAP. huge well potential carriers schools major vector transmission. /r/NoShitSherlock Highly unlikely another dose would needed 6 months. People hearing booster 6 months thinking would mean EVERY six months. one know recently boosted patients followed time, way secondary immune responses work one provide better protection longer. additional doses needed likely yearly fall dose along flu vaccine.  wealthy privilege arrange alternatives, yeah probably would.

Now Delta (TBD).  Well, they're risk anyone else kinda going somewhere. number doses given daily [fallen dramatically last Supply longer issue. Whether issue demand (including approval third doses) logistics really matter. need using doses now.

mRNA doses require significant cold storage side effects young people. inactivated vaccines going better many countries (maybe even kids rich countries we're choosing instead vaccinate, though none even run trials find out). hey, enough. i’m going. things want. yet UK high transmission right now, cases per capita US ever delta wave. partner 2 shots 6 months ago. that’s asking culture UK. hanging stuffy unventilated room full unmasked humans don’t know (eg pub) still risk, booster not. want find balance. get want pretend it’s there’s 0 risk that’s me. even don’t get symptomatic disease i’d still get stuck UK get infected can’t afford money-wise. richest country world excuse fucking badly did.

Would safer start get 2 doses Pfizer?    true. Production longer bottleneck, distribution - unless restricting vaccination include mRNA vaccines (as opposed Sinovac similar). 

June August average 35 million doses given daily. We're 25 million doses/day given. Distribution ticked ever slightly past week two EU US authorized boosters. 

The idea one dose given domestically takes away dose given elsewhere longer accurate. 

Middle income countries across many different geographies like Turkey, Chile, Cambodia, Turkmenistan, Panama, Brazil higher vaccination rates US. Big middle income countries like Mexico, Thailand, others 50% first dose. 

While supply completely irrelevant, big middle income countries low vaccination rates tied hesitancy. Russia, Philippines, Pakistan population large majority want vaccine. Indonesia exception rule, actual supply challenges still seeing distribution rates go up. India one ""big country"" supply challenges still, choice made itself: one world's largest producers vaccines choosing ship countries rather use domestically. 

That leaves low income countries. yes, supply challenges, distribution challenges vaccine hesitancy dominate countries. Regardless supply, uptake countries low. 

It true world supply constrained couple months ago. reached inflection point: nearly 7 billion doses administered. 50% world's adults vaccinated least one dose. additional percent going harder get. 

Bioethics longer determinant vaccine supply goes. Seems like sustainable four months high case counts.

[Hospitalizations flat,

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm beyond pissed FDA thought could get away delaying vaccine 5-11 year olds till school started. Children died decided cover ass. 
Something around 300 million doses given people 12 100 years old reported serious harm. afraid somehow maybe maybe vaccines would cause serious harm 5-11 years olds? worth delaying vaccine 3 months start school year? Oh please. vaccination reduce spread. obvious data highly vaccinated populations / countries already indicate vaccines stop control transmission.

British study pre-print posted 9/29/2021:

**Vaccination reduces transmission Delta, less Alpha variant. impact vaccination decreased time. Factors PCR-measured viral load important vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Booster vaccinations may help control transmission together preventing infections.** 
  fully agree this. think they'll recommended required, people get them.  deaths measure matters. Hospitalisations rise large number developing long Covid.

The NHS already great pressure current growth hospitalisations, plus rising flu cases, sustainable. point, 🤷🏼‍♂️.

This happens virus gets politicized. Needless deaths happen, masses get desensitized point caring. 

See y’all months next death statistic report, nothing changes.  I’m HCW planning get booster next week. got 2 Moderna doses trying decide try get Pfeizer, go Moderna again. Also sure they’ll give Moderna booster time… old days, used shoot seamen regard kinda ridiculous since you’re gonna masked outdoors anyway. Transmission rates would far lower.  understand antibody levels greatest predictor protection infection.

I know cells play part clearing infection infected, turn helping prevent hospitalisation/death.  Judging replies apparently not. Exact time fine, long they're different arms two people administering shots. Otherwise think 30 Correct wrong but, whole point getting booster increase antibody levels?

Memory cells able mobilise fast enough prevent infection, especially big issue super fast replication Delta variant. could make fewer Kings Ranch Ford 150s Lol exact response  attest this. breakthrough infection wish people would stop thinking vaccine makes 100% immune. Yeah, I'm sure telling people November 2019 go next Spanish Flu. Lying internet fun easy it? Thanks friendly explination lot people thought misleading. call idiots want choose to. Instead advocate titles everyone understands. Even less educated seem look on. Mu mutwo still hiding till end?? spent half hour response misinformation posted elsewhere. post happily got buried, I'm adapting response case useful someone;

**Did European Union’s Database Adverse Drug Reactions report 2,000,000 injuries 20,000 deaths due coronavirus vaccines?**

Answer: **no.**

The source figures appears blog dubious name medicalkidnap.com

In contrast, [here's EU's summary current reports vaccine including links drug reaction reports mentioned OP. provide one single headline figure (instead breaking individual vaccine), went totted up;

665,707 people reported kind medical event vaccination.

Of those, 6990 died

For reference, that's total 562,800,000 recieving vaccine.

Why medicalkidnap's numbers different? know sure, reports following caveat anyone attempting analysis;

""These figures cannot extracted directly public database suspected adverse reactions, groups information per type side effects. one suspected side effect may included single case report, total number side effects never match number individual cases. Similarly, public database provide total number cases reported fatal outcome.""

Did medicalkidnap.com flawed analysis described above? know sure, presented data, sure looks like know logistics? Deaths fallen level background noise quite literally everyone vulnerable vaccinated, good? I'm vaccinated too, definitely trust government fda, largely funded companies they're supposed overseeing. Correct, to.  Yes people stupid. cannot shed it’s simply spike protein. (And technically even spike protein cell takes mRNA starts creating spike proteins) Equating spike protein virus would like assuming entire ass human thing persons finger. true - shown comments whole industries show vaccination status condition employment decades. get vaccinated Hep B due OSHA regs 1990s stay employed I’m engineer!

Healthcare, food services, education, biotech, pharmaceuticals - care huge sectors US economy! Labor shortages? like opportunities advance get hired. There's belief small artificially constructed worms found poking skin vaccinated.

Totally coincidentally thinking worms bugs skin happens symptom psychosis maybe police refuse wear masks global pandemic they're afraid public may feel anything else? would imply police really kind, caring, sensitive guys all, want loved. Goodness gracious, sounds like Mayberry honest. Somehow think refusal wear masks, matter what, America's worst recorded pandemic history love specific authoritarian leader deeply-felt concern citizen concerns able recognize them. sayin'. Whiny cowards. See unemployment line. Oh, wait. I'm unemployed. Maybe I'm health risk everyone work around, I've taken protective vaccine. vaccinated, even care breakthrough cases? know several people breakthrough cases none experienced anything worse cold, even less. countries Europe, like UK, mask mandates anymore.
Others, like Spain, France Portugal still mandates place students.
Now compare numbers. much correlation causation, IMO. shot arm. Boeing government contractor, can’t back down. improve work force… apes smarter anti-vaxxers.  Fair question. often difficult tell. people know allergic certain ingredients vaccines, others traced epileptic seizures times vaccinated, others still immunological conditions lead ""unvaccinatable"". people - anecdotal - advised doctors get vaccinated. 

It's also true people lack institutional &amp; financial support (e.g. can't afford take time work without pay get vaccinated) can't get vaccinated. 

Those access healthcare professionals, safely ask questions side-effects potentially adverse effects (however low probabilities are, exist open discussion), can't make informed decision whether ought vaccinated. Though *can* make choice, think ensure make *informed* choice. 

The Atlantic published couple well-informed articles points - example, here: 

All I'm saying important matters need discussed thoroughly, seem happening places around world. lie go medical guidance. Great advice. saw FB post claiming thousands Southwest Airlines employees ""refusing poison jab"" so, going end vaccine mandates ""save America."" 

Can't wait see works out, lol. police unions either. airlines 15-20% workforce un-vaxxed exemptions. Yes, 80% great could much higher potentially losing 1 5 workers major impact companies there's already labor shortage. dick nowhere near size. “Nanoworms”. WTH that? know I’m going regret learning answer. think completely wrong that. They're working hospitals surprising given hospital workers obviously medical training also seen first hand covid do. We're seeing stories industries fields people protesting resisting vaccines. Southwest major cancellations due sickout. live unions local manufacturing plants gearing possible strike. They've sent letters plants intent challenge mandate. think fears labor shortages founded reality. I'm speaking unofficially. check whether fall categories. even one really want booster, get it.  hospitalizations deaths, highly vaccinated countries doing? There's like 25 ppl photo. Boeing employees 30k people Everett I'm sorry medical condition. wish one poor health. majority country, need vaccinated move covid. me, never think unless one subs pop feed. best stay places masked people, want think covid anymore. mental health afford luxury continuing dwell covid. right mind would stop going school work flu like symptoms

I hate every single person like you. sick STAY FUCK HOME stop coming work coughing sneezing fucking place getting coworkers sick well. basic common decency courtesy.

Even *jUsT cOlD*, WANT IT. Stay home keep yourself. think lot people going continue live isolated relatively antisocial lives post-pandemic become somewhat misanthropic well.

I entirely agree that. Ever since vaccines came out, people filling stadiums areas NFL games, MLB games, concerts, social events. friends age also hanging others, dating, hugging, kissing, getting engage/married, taking trips going social gatherings again. experience far live Midwest maybe different others based live. 

I still socializing throughout pandemic last year always wore mask everywhere go, always fall winter last year. I'm fully vaccinated Pfizer I've decided wear mask I'm sick, outside cold, business I'm going requires wear one. 

I understand others may never socialize much this. think everybody needs stay away forever. People always living fear time need go sometimes. can’t lol. Stop spreading misinformation. Considering lot comments see minimizing ""mild"" cases long covid. think paragraph news lot infected COVID—including weren’t hospitalized—are risk developing heart failure deadly blood clots year recovering virus, new study finds.

Of course first cruise ship studied showed even asymptomatic people lung damage covid, mostly people either ignoring want hear pushing agenda. first sentence article tells situation survivors one year infection, no, know happens people one year infection early 2020, disease around full year.

You need read whole article that's much maybe click link eyeball article second. Headlines can't explain studies actually researched end misunderstanding.  It’s almost like breakthrough infections exist… I’m really sorry. husband transplant. I’m hoping best family.  Really surprising. Construction work dangerous police work. everyone luxury “forget covid”, especially pre-existing condition. I’ve double jabbed since end May went without mask around others (for one lunch restaurant) since pandemic started. don’t want take chances. Good. Thanks antivax propaganda coming overseas. yes, specifically mean US. multiple vaccine platforms. underlying medical condition could make someone unvacinatable? mean there’s reason unvaccinatable isn’t word English - AFAIK it’s never happened! clinic million doses ""feel"" like oppression

It actually bit authoritarian, disingenuous pretend otherwise.

But lots things authoritarian society ideally we've limit essentials like food safety, road rules, definition felony crimes, etc. convo perspective. **The mandate essential need, frivolous.** No, ironically started **actual** vaccine conspiracy. kind conspiracy antivaxxers think... 
The dude published first antivax study, tried link MMR vaccine autism, got paid by/had shares companies producing individual vaccines replaced combined one. trying slander competition. feel generally disconnected society point. people, left right views even remotely line mine seems like they're stuck made social media world. find keep mouth shut go camping whenever possible.  government gonna come covid! Per article:
Supermarkets Frankfurt surrounding region implement rules allow vaccinated Covid-recovered people onto premises. 'Risking blowback'. God help us risking blowback important saving lives human suffering. Oh yeah, whole point mandates work. don’t care people’s heart get vaccine, get it.  Guarantee trumpee Boeing cousin that.  Oh I'm good wondered long lasting immunity backed anything, ""feel"", even admission. presenting fact, saying friend need vaccine, presented ZERO evidence support claim, despite challenged multiple times.

You spreading falsehoods based solely feelings, zealot. That's projection May 9, 2021. continue model would much more. Usually assume person talking place article referenced. 9...9 comments 3 hours old.  Yes did! Signed local pharmacy. started moderna. believe saw previously JJ, asked “this first shot?” said yes, got fixed up.  ""I account BECU!""

Edit non-locals: Boeing Employees Credit Union local bank longer exclusive Boeing Employees.   That’s truly unfortunate you. individual pre existing conditions, mask up, socially distance, weigh risks. basically force society unfair. people afford forget COVID, should. vaccines made truly possible people. I'm American please explain blue also vaccine hesitancy thing?  scam doesn’t cure covid. OK. 4 people, vaccinated, risk small. Obstinate, obtuseness obnoxiousness. time traits left behind childhood. Now, traits considered virtuous adult circles, Trump giving license. 

From experienced traits toxic group setting, counter productive. guess mandate silver lining covid.  really scam people seeking out? all. need require vaccine negative test. Breakthough infections (particularly asymptomatic ones) quite high. 

The vaccines 95% effectiveness preventing hospitalization. 

They 40% efficiency preventing transmitting disease. That's even half.  big event test, likely letting literally dozens people covid will, unless rigorous masking social distancing followed, go infect vaccinated people. think first reply got removed cursing something? lol ima try blood clots heart inflammation

at point gonna get covid vax, escaping one other. chance blood clots heart inflammation way, way higher covid first ones take since like leaders country

they already did. mofos among first get vaxxed. every single rich jerk jumped line get it, even tucker previous president. president compel executive, he's head executive--he cant compel legislative anything. legislative isnt exempt, guarantee 99% vaxxed dentist using mouthwash I'm chair. But, outside specific setting, really see could use mouthwash. can't tell within 30 minutes, mouth replenished virus. Impossible. We’ve told Australia currently experiencing WWIII. problem get ivermectin, also get Regeneron.

So assume god ivermectin saved them, really experimental monoclonal antibodies, disinfo abuse medical staff continues. There's obviously argument certain level vaccination let everyone wants catch COVID so. essentially UK doing, many lower-vaccinated countries forced do. giving kids least one dose (which 0 myocarditis risk) first makes sense though. live nurse spent summer applying hospital jobs got none. 

Do eat shut they’re shoveling.  don’t. Plenty scammy doctors making bank prescribing online.   like analogy completely correct. good evidence antibodies correlate protection least short term, people focus them. original comment chain cite NIH study showing JJ ineffective badly missrepresent study, study actually suggests two shot JJ compares two shot JJ antibody response. extent antibodies whole story, study used criticize JJ even less. Honestly huge number breakthrough infections (particularly asymptomatic ones) requiring vaccination negative test. protect hospitalization death?  got flu shot day. slightly sore. Nothing like Moderna shots could barely lift arm. I'm mistaken, need visit hospital receive dewormer. Save embarrassment expenses get shelf. Now, I'm phone moment able pull perfect numbers references moment—but numbers coming within first couple Google results.

|Condition|US Adult Pct|
|:-|-:|
Overweight/Obese|74%
High Blood Pressure|47%
Current/Former Smoker|40%
65+|21%
Alcohol Use Disorder|13%
Diabetes|11%
Mood Disorder|10%
Current/Prior Cancer|9%
Asthma|8%
COPD|5%
Immunocompromised|4%
Pregnant|2%

And that's [Underlying Medical guidance.

I'll need find source it, I'm recalling pulled numbers different comment something like quarter third adults United States normal range BMI high blood pressure—I'll find you-but even taking lower end that, top two medical qualifiers alone get us 86%, use 1/3 brings us 90%. add current former smokers overweight hypertensive definitely get 90%, keep going list adding dwindling fraction people without anything listed above.

My rough, back-of-the-envelope math says certain edge 99% remaining 10 health conditions listed. Alcohol mood disorders probably somewhat correlated, well smoking, asthma, COPD, smoking cancer—but lots cancers lung cancer. Pregnancy immunocompromised likely two least correlated, would likely carry through.

On top that, 50±% US workers jobs would covered CDC's [Occupational Institutional guidance.

So, we're left healthy Americans—the top _maybe_ 1%—with else equal would expect half qualify.

So, yeah, _a little_ close all.

Tell read CDC recommendations without telling read CDC recommendations. charitable interpretations, though, ""ignoring science"" ""making shit up"". 

The question - asked response comment, way - could read charitably as: ""As far know conditions lead people ""unvaccinatable"" - conditions think might?""

I also think slight misinterpretation (or miscommunication) commentator thought meant conditions would render people *utterly* unvaccinatable (so cannot subject *any* vaccine), far surprising claim people claim people unable subject specific vaccinations (for record, tried provide anecdotal examples both). 

The issue whether affirmation contradicted. issue whether communicate way allows us learn one another (no matter cheesy sounds). Nobody ever learned called ignorant fraudulent. worry response seems imply accusations. Hazard Ratio. 

In direct example, authors saying given subjects Covid non-Covid groups living minimum 30 days, Covid group 1.48 times likely stroke. words, strokes expected average 10 100 subjects 12 months, would expect see average ~15 Covid subjects time frame.

The article keeps reloading me, looked like burden (seen number events) also included. Often times, however, burden includes events even subject multiple events - HR based first event usually. assume also including factors covariants (aka influencers outcome) age, order truly try determine effect Covid things equal. think missing point. told entire population get third dose would send far, far doses pharmacies. cannot simultaneously send dose Nigeria send pharmacy. idea even hold water.  There's nothing even debunk, yet people keep arguing it.  coworker's wife works small rural hospital. said lost 2 porters. Yup. people push hospital beds hospital.

Oh no!

Anyways. stats this? I'm pretty sure even work career causes death higher COVID. Also, contributing COVID deaths since cops dying obese old ones probably. aren’t vaccinated, government contracts. negotiation  Soooooo...why listen Current US Feds?????? could see might listen wanna-be Dictator like Trump.  Nope, land borders Canada Mexico. Yes, land borders Mexico Canada restricted essential travel - returning American citizens, people authorized work US, commercial truckers, etc.

I’m Canadian lives 15 miles border, unable drive US since March 2020. able fly in, though haven’t done that. I'm curious - would concerned flu season?  


Last year literally zero flu cases, thanks social distancing masks improved hygiene. goes show science behind preventative measures sound. Motherfuck 😥 think I'm clear I'm saying. I'm saying can't look mandates working hospitals say they're working there, they'll work well general population. Reddit seems think case think logic holds all. I’m well aware trying funny. know risk children low. Immunocompromised people small minority dealt issue long covid. need protection, know protect themselves. Asking millions people wear mask protect small minority indeed selfish. mandates area longer make sense, time ignore them. area 85% vaccinated low case rate low hospitalizations. mandates become political longer make sense. lot people family business connections Canada Mexico US. 90% educated estimation. educated estimation?

Only small number local jurisdictions vaccine mandates food handlers, aka restaurant workers. 

Im acting like exist. I'm acting like minority.

Kids going summer camp part US workforce. every comment removed ?? account retired cops too? ridiculous lol Ivermectin question sure. he's making affirmations germany one big european country facing pretty big rise cases like know Germany UK common? falling behind vaccination countries climb stair vaccine population. 

Definitely cherry picking.

Both Belgium Netherlands witnessing significant increases right - Belgium posted highest figure since May. 

Singapore starting go peak massive wave ever, pretty much second vaccinated country world.

Germany increasing relatively slowly, bad vaccine wise (vaccine % Germany notoriously underestimated, RKI mentioned), also death rate pretty much Italy's despite 5x cases. means either covid Germany merciful Italy, simply Germany catching cases. turn makes clear comparing different countries' case load figures taking face value pretty meaningless always affected testing rates policies.

You even [scientific proving rise cases pretty much unrelated level vaccination. Unless cherry pick data, is.  described wait long. Previous studies viruses vaccines show usually takes least 3 4 months begin getting full blown, robust germinal center produced memory based immune systems developed. get infection vaccination (any challenge type pathogen) possible reset entirely halt germinal center's production long term memory based immunity. There's even infections get reset memory based immune responses previous infections, that's another story. might part natural infections result 10-20 percent cases developing immunity all, vaccine based challenges 1-2 percent people unable develop immunity.

What’s difficult understand?

The main difference second hand smoke doesn’t spread kill people within days/weeks exposure, spread inhale even people exponentially.

The reason covid numbers remotely comparable yearly smoking deaths mitigation past 19 months - masks, distancing, vaccines. Unlike smoking, virus spread unchecked, potentially infect 80%+ population short amount time. death rate 1-2 per 100 infected, reach 3 million deaths 10 times hospitalizations. would overwhelm hospitals ~14 times over, leading even non-Covid deaths even supply line/economic collapse.

Their body, choice, consequences. one checked vaccination status going US. even customs/immigration. came going indoor dining theatre NYC.

Canada definitely checks going back since support mixed doses obviously isn’t issue going back. feel like wait see if/when CDC expands guidelines recommend everybody get booster shot, there's technically nothing stopping going get booster shot right now. wish knew recommending that.

I get impression think recommending *against* people getting boosters, that's did.

The ""risks"" vaccine small, another six twenty going make difference. we're talking don't. like throwing tantrums. Wtf like Lightfoot It’s ok bad risk assessment. Correct; one dose given booster either mRNA vaccines. least that’s case right US. Wild entitlement protest lifesaving vaccine distributed free. Yes. I’m really surprised many kids stayed college this. perfect opportunity take pause (or delay) reflect exactly looking school first place. 

I get upperclassman would want finish move life. incoming freshmen 2020 2021 mind blowing me. College even worth cost anymore half kids least it’s fun experience. take away begs question kids aren’t going state tuitions, community college, even online learning. Let's go! work public school, we'd like wear mask whole school year! far I’m aware one large RCT mask efficacy (Bangladesh) showed cloth masks effective. others? ruling didn’t suggest *should* implement 2G. said could. won’t. ruling wasn’t specifically supermarkets. Einzelhandel. retail store. I’m fence personally. Yes getting food essential even unvaccinated people. get vaccine free time. would right thing do. hand. vaccinated people need suffer bad choices? need risk getting infected buying groceries alongside unvaccinated people? wear masks *them*? lot restrictions us still living people decide get vaccinated. extremely frustrating point I’m done thinking needs people decide making things easier us. 

That said course I’m aware people can’t get vaccinated absolutely willing take measures protect them. that’s reason everyone get vaccinated can.  makes feel better, 20’s really one long extension college people. without homework/studying lot money spend due job degree gets you. 

I suspect students getting screwed college life right going double partying 20’s. cares ""risking blowback""? Taking vaccine obviously right choice. need turn ""both sides"" thing. afford premiums COBRA, yeah. used maybe 25 years ago amazingly expensive. continues whatever insurance plan employer helping pay for, suddenly employer isn’t helping more. don’t know ACA changed way not. This. Especially considering JJ vaccine produced severely limited numbers due main production closed month due epic contamination issue. headline desperate gloomy. got news you. Depression reserved college students. Everyone fucking sick shit depressed. people fucking morons running around acting like problem. 20% population fucking rest us. Yes, seems common retort. rather, number people dying probably real, absolutely refuse accept deaths due COVID-19. try argue term ""co-morbidity"" actually means, try argue concept 'excess deaths' that. like trying explain something brick wall - they're wrapped alternate reality amount explaining objective facts do.  agree. username tho… don’t know think. love yet I’m little grossed out. Unlike [these genius [I shit  ""They refuse silenced.""

But may poison jump tall buildings. /s Yeah, sorry hear. mean trivialize struggle, fine complain. one use reddit main social outlet, terrible that. neglect scholarships, dig everything might surprised. FAFSA mandatory, remain blown away number people even fill out. hard worth doubt. Vax ppl come sizes colors

They started yesterday. think people wait another interminable ACIP meeting. Obviously. ""poor"" means. Hosting Olympics pretty irresponsible   didn’t Zero deaths? think see winter wave start? overweight significant risk factor Covid, sure minimising it. Sorry sounds blunt, reading threads r/nursing, say patients overweight otherwise healthy. I'd get booster 6 months available. I’m glad know that.    Or, know… leaders could’ve listened experts set better example encourage masks, distancing, provided financial support individuals businesses, pro-vaccine marketing campaigns, etc. 

Instead fell “save economy” message declared pandemic way soon.  based science. even CDC says that. clearly said vaccinated people ditch masks. Nobody mask mandates anymore vaccines needed. 

It almost CDC terribly wrong lot things since early 2020.

I mask mandate work, government building. beginning June lifted, went back effect August.

Your first question interesting one. don’t post tobacco related subreddit see say matter. 

Your second question obvious bad faith attempt confuse discussion merits consideration whatsoever.  Here’s data source explaining data hard obtain.[September tracker say deaths India weren’t identified sex truth probably never know real worldwide count. countries publish health data, excess deaths ultimately help us figure actual impact including miscounted deaths Covid attributed ailments well secondary effects over-stressed medical systems delayed treatments. US gets things control avoids another winter surge still 850-900k. We’re looking factor 1.25-1.4 terms current undercount. country like India lacks comprehensive annual health reporting, never know, I’ve seen estimates undercounting factor 3-4. best guess Russia they’re somewhere two. models made assuming mitigating measures taken, give public idea infectious thing is. Early models indicated something effect 40-70% population would eventually become infected, IIRC.

I'll admit early on, seemed like people losing minds something hundred people small percentage resulted serious illness even smaller percentage death. 

It big deal even early on, data showed contagious is. know CCs suck lol, blunt, I'm poor universities expensive 😌. right though. joined clubs, hobbies. honestly really difficult make friends though. wanted vent anxiety never bad pandemic. Thank though. 5 million people  lost 3 family members covid. :( proud American. Exactly. Thank god vaccines, feel like they’re best hope next couple years.  comment ""buT Many liVes woulD Saved maDe tAke twO doSes Mr Fauci?""

Like two maybe? many, that's sure. J&amp;J still really effective preventing hospitalization death one dose.

Masks restrict activities vaccinated far think go. state Australia (QLD) 7 deaths total. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seven. Well naturally. fellow thirsty people throwing fits thirsty asked wear anti-thirst mask huge part many retail restaurant workers going ""Fuuuuuck that!"" wanting work anymore, thus labor shortages everywhere... mainly community colleges smaller institutions, lot universities open precautions all. really agree precautions, agree closed two years vaccines testing either. Everything backwards. SE Asia showing world done.    Yeah get either. company tried recruit paid interns school year, usually summers. could safe hands-on person work training. Response pretty meh. Enrollments like 5-8%. Seems like would perfect year take gap, except travel abroad. different types shock, sepsis one type shock.  Yeah, too. never really expected much, usually bad CC. know handful people went horrible least. really care much friends anyway; wish classes could person I'm stuck house 24/7 Americans obviously prioritise education much schools closed majority pandemic, despite small risk children.  anyone tried use [digital covid-19 vaccine California? worried putting personal information there. Also, virus removed many vulnerable unvaccinated people vulnerable pool killing them. Yeah, know right? would think colleges higher education would important bars festivals apparently not. Illinois, masks, vaccines, regular testing required schools, understand believe we're safe enough fully open. lot venues, bars, events, etc. requiring vaccines barely anyone wears masks. We're fully online though. semester classes person except two. registered early classes next semester hopes classes would person, complete opposite: classes online except one (plus one hybrid class). make sense either online lectures close person classes stay campus attend online lectures. Like what's point online ""safety"" I'm risk campus anyway?? care us all.   think that's planning give children initially. meant reduce amount circulating virus producing durable adult immune response.   actually reversed: mRNA vaccines developed part deliver vaccine RSV. Part reason ready go mRNA time around COVID prior work.

I think new trials focusing limiting circulation RSV producing durable immune response adults. I'm optimistic gain enough traction limit spread given community, enough parents young children get perhaps enough.

Also, spread misinformation often, RSV one viruses ADE observed. early vaccine candidate inactivated virus caused it, studies show even naturally derived antibodies result ADE (at one time speculation mother's antibodies passed near time birth may resulted ADE first RSV infection newborns, though think established fact).

All say RSV complicated. hope next generation mRNA vaccines finally get control, means given.  hmm interesting. considering ""only 8.5%"" people die due secondhand tobacco smoke exposure acceptable figure? become unacceptable? 10%, 20%? 


Also interesting ""100% deaths secondhand Covid"". 100% people exposed ""secondhand covid"" die covid? Good bot Vaccine mandates save lives. Good Lord! safe effective vaccine this! Let's pray! They're community college. Universities competitive want little online possible now. Also CCs known campus life.  time I’ve ever heard try bring statistics it, either completely made nonsense idea even came (like 99.97 survival rate) favorite, using numbers March/April 2020. Also love “more people die flu” the. Ask many die flu every year won’t even ballpark idea guess. man sure confident it. Thank you. fine now. Post Covid also brutal. lost ability think properly like two months CS engineer. yeah life doesn’t stop. 90% recovered. miss him. suspect able roll vaccines sooner, would still position now. Possibly even worse, since lockdown restrictions might lessened due higher proportion population vaccinated. anti-vax folks would ignored lockdown either way.  Taiwan 846 deaths. Except ones recite, fake number deaths vaccine. need vaccination help stop spread end like Alaska. Pre Delta data isn’t relevant now. won‘t believe number 7 is.  fully vaccinated adult booster shot. think question needs asked, enough, would then. Meaning, need enjoy life point again.  variant Delta Plus? noticed Ireland Delta surge followed Delta AY.4 surge. Antibody tests recommended measure immunity determine get shot. I'm northeast people reasonably healthy, least 30 group. lived midwest 2 years completely shocked massive average person was. I'm dude, 5'10 168 pounds totally dwarfed people there. eye opening depressing, probably think that's humans supposed look like. bullet points *Getting Flu Vaccine COVID-19 Pandemic*. seen that? CDC COVID-19 listed underlying cause 345,323 deaths 2020 third leading underlying cause death, heart disease (690,882 deaths) cancer  Also brain logo done wrong. assume green squiggly supposed temporal lobe it’s backwards false choice though. logistics place get excess doses countries greater need. know guy doing, based whatever data Germany giving ECDC positive rate country 6,444%.

You dowload data conclusion Germany unsafe total bullshit, that's ECDC calculation compare incidences. pretty easy keep %postive   lived rural south bit. ""skinny"". 5'10 165lbs. Almost everyone overweight. sounds like hyperbole kid like 90% people heavy, point 30-40 lbs overweight made one fit ones. Gotcha. makes sense. That's literally said. said study more.  Nuts! Brain school ass… brainless school like simple binary. Vaccines protect well much safe without one, community spread also quite high moment we're sure vaccinated people still spread infection, worth making frankly quite minor change exactly things normally except sometimes wearing mask. Like, realize they're comfy ears inhibiting us using favorite lipsticks, we'll survive that, unvaccinated neighbors might survive case Covid. ""dishonorable"" Hey, it’s free country wanted die, did. It’s real shame clogged health system protracted suicides prevented truly need help (emergencies scheduled surgeries) getting it.

It’s incredibly selfish thing do, goes old adage “you swing fist wherever like long stops short nose”.

Still, sum up: Good riddance. basically one know cops never seen happens cops actually job makes absolutely sense all. 

I suggest reread wrote think trying say see rewrite comment reflect head intended. Try avoid false equivalency straw man displays. I'm quite glad dose got extended 8 weeks Canada. Can't help wonder 3rd dose might last even longer think. Several vaccine regimes 3 doses well. Yes, know Coronavirus, we're living moving target speak. wait see.... You’re immune system creates antibodies needed. Otherwise shelfs blueprints hand produce new army case future attack.

You don’t instance continue create smallpox antibodies moment vaccination rest life. funny. I'm vaccinated well educated. see rare rare vaccinated people. also see vast majority long covid resolves within three four weeks. tells huge risk me. first would get covid unlikely would get long covid even unlikely would last longer couple weeks. What's more, want live life way lived last 15 months. Honestly would rather gotten covid died early on. risk long covid seems miniscule thought pain living like have.

Let add, fully support live life however choose. attacked decision making capability way. find necessary attack mine? 600k COVID deaths preventable  Delta Deluxe far know take time. Wasn’t phiser someone suggesting this?   using report scientists justify listening scientists? US could gone way Russia 700K extra dead 145M population masks, lockdowns. protect aunt uncle hospitalization prevent uncle dying (2 doses Pfizer each; infected widespread recommendation Pfizer boosters).

Covid19 still serious threat high-risk population, even vaccines. Boosters make lot better, less 15% 65yos (in US) gotten far. Hopefully get 50%+ Christmas. Well, MORE. 0.2% Haitians fully vaccinated...could breeding ground new variant give more, rather give 2 dose people another one. Scotland ""Freedom Day"" kept restrictions. Summer significantly infections England. Antivaxxers-are unique US. parents friend living [—-] refused getting vaccines despite eligible. course do. aren’t going anywhere. said Q word... never say Q word healthcare work small white town little crime cops fantastic. assume seedier place work seedier kinds employees get. one wants work poor ghettos law enforcement. every country fully Rome reopened?

Not sure countries im going share Italy since country.

Except concerts indoors allowed know basically anything else normal events like going disco indoors limited 50%. 

Theaters football stadium full capacity.

Can't really say everything back normal daily routine except mask put face nothing limited.

So full reopening least harmfull everything else result 30/35k cases every day potentially long Covid patients aggravate health care even more. think lot sailors refusing actually looking way military. problem anthrax whatever vaccines, hard time believing issue one. get it. Bodily autonomy hard thing argue against.  


If important enough force issue...just pay people get it. Offer monthly stipend year get vaccinated.  previous job spent lot time cops duty duty. watched one cop tell drug addict next time OD'd would let die. know several cops families hook prostitutes; even try hide it. Excessive force ""part job"". Cops use N word freely. specific examples cops shit even cops like ""that's risky"" but, may may know, cops rat they're cops long. Cops super hero's think are. Canada we’ve still gotten single usable dose delivered. hope using hesitating people might trouble returning second doses (under housed homeless folks, etc)… wonder we’re ever getting point According recent data, look case. Rather, 2 J&amp;J's roughly equal unboosted Pfizer, 1 J&amp;J + 1 Pfizer/Moderna gets boosted Pfizer. However, data public days small sample size, FDA comfortable relying yet. Please stop parroting random dogmas, especially even fit topic. nailed it! friend actually bet lady $250 trump wouldn’t reinstated March. took bet paid money. Then, month later, saying gonna August, October. knows is. long move goal posts! I’d love see many deaths preventable due heart disease comparison. Fantastic.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* long before/after take flu shot relative 3rd booster? Administering Pfizer vaccine doses 6-14 weeks apart offers better protection administering 3-4 weeks apart. According this. UK resident here. Transmission high moment.

The overwhelming attitude public pandemic over. fine though fresh booster - good luck.  forget people may underlying health conditions besides overweight may know since regular health check-ups really thing here. think talking case mentioned virus changes lot, variant-specific booster would still effective (even protective someone went without previous years flu vaccines).

When talking large changes flu virus, broad exposure multiple years varieties flus going advantage. problem small changes, sometimes happens even flu. would bigger problem something less variety changes slowly, like sars2.

Also, want make clear suggesting get annual flu vaccines. That's still recommendation groups like CDC problem described still change still better get vaccine every year not. Ugh wedding 2 weeks (already moved year ago, it’s happening time)… issue walking CVS asking booster? allowed due bureaucracy? clear data AZ Pfizer, one mentions Moderna. add that, assuming matter others privileged whether want admit say.. vaccine works. true overall situation UK right absolutely shameful.

Nobody bothering mitigations restrictions long gone. I’m doubtful since flu vaccine adds exposure influenza virus. Every little bit helps giving immune system work comes fighting influenza. 

Influenza viruses different coronaviruses since influenza mutates like crazy comparably. reason flu shots need continually updated influenza constantly “escaping” vaccine.  Well yes. places go require room distancing. problem comes regulate public. talking here. rest world outweighs need *more* already got that, again, rest world *still even yet* Anybody booster/third shot 6 months?

I antibody test low number (4 months post 2nd Pfizer June). Well case, healthy 26 year old fully vaccinated adult, wear mask indoor settings. apparently, great protection, mask isn’t necessary case. think Biden Administration could strategically prevented lot deaths. 

what mean ""a lot""?

it like 600k+ deaths time took office. Ok going fear monger attitude? think opposite, got people taking version vaccine people hesitant take saved lives sure. looking good us UK. Unfortunately government public, following lead, completely given controlling transmission.  Tell know zero cops without telling know zero cops. fact is, right Russia surplus Sputnik-V vaccine \*\*far\*\* exceeds demand. large anti-vaccine movement Russia unfortunately, driven part Western news outlets talking Sputnik V vaccine ""possibly unsafe"" absurdly false. Data Mexico, Hungary, Serbia, Argentina...etc shows Sputnik-V vaccine effective safe. 40% population vaccinated. anti-vax movement sharing American news media talking ""safety risks"" Sputnik-V. anti-vax movement killing hundreds thousands Russia. 

Regarding intelligence agencies, trust Western intelligence agencies much trust Russian intelligence agencies, meaning all. Anything American intelligence agencies say, dismiss outright lie. think Fauci gave reasonable responses. took J&amp;J I'm young male want risk myocarditis. take booster, I'll take J&amp;J booster only, mRNA. 50 antibodies enough get rid virus, care 400 J&amp;J booster 700 mRNA booster?

I'm also believer chasing constant 90+% infection protection, that's silly. Delta spreads like chickenpox, we're gonna get obviously. point get it, want avoid hospital that's matters me.

I would also love see J&amp;J affects immune memory cells, care antibodies wane several months, want long term memory want take shot every year. giving vaccines. rather uninformed mentality have. Companies produce boosters could instead working sending reliable vaccines countries. sleeping recent UN summit regarding vaccines? Providing Insight anti-maskers front line worker perspective.

Got weirdest rant ever. store “you need mask shop store”

The anti-maskers complaining pointing making feel like monsters respected don’t provide mask.
- happen procedure:
1. mask.

2. no, Sorry don’t anymore masks please maintain social distancing

3. barring anyone entering store.

Apparently “problem” make feel like anti-maskers one people store wearing mask employees talking distance. Stating need provide mask make feel comfortable.

The worst part anti-maskers seeking validation us let them. employees cannot stop anti-maskers coming. allowed give anti-maskers validation shopping without mask.
The thing is, literally ran masks going 150box ( 50per count) week. Providing masks responsibility store’s ( capable 3 month ago). social distancing standard protocol best keep employees safe. don’t like mask up. 

Tldr; plan going outside without mask ina situation aren’t fully recovered yet. expect deal consequences. importantly, don’t go around thinking control people. Cases high UK barely anyone age 18 one dose let alone two doses vaccine, UK schools fully opened mask mandates. age brackets overwhelmingly highest cast positivity rate entire nation. Also, UK ton testing counts asymptomatic vaccinated positive cases. It’s putting policy never enforced know make people angry get shared widely online giving excellent free advertising help reach people think smart policy. True suppose, imo matter following science(which US pretty good producing) politicizing it(which sadly us seems pretty good well). Korea simply best example that, observations. cancer heart disease easily transmitted person person?  probably best time mention JnJ also “cutting edge tech”. JnJ injects DNA coding stabilized coronavirus spike protein adenovirus, adenovirus “infects” cells injection site. adenovirus uses stabilized coronavirus spike protein DNA instruct adenovirus “infected” cells make stabilized COVID coronavirus spike protein mRNA body uses make protein RNA vaccines make. 

The RNA vaccines deliver RNA directly bypassing adenovirus DNA step. ways adenovirus vaccines cutting edge complicated RNA vaccines. 

For RNA vaccines technology breakthrough getting RNA vaccine RNA incredibly fragile. say RNA post I’m referring specific type RNA called mRNA.

For record first learned types genomic based vaccines 2000s developed treat cancer. research went decades long. didn’t spring nowhere year. believe school earlier threatened fire teachers got vaccinated. think it’s safe say making policy get free advertising media attract people antivaxxers. Nobody willing vaccinate kid sending school anyway. “I’ld die country.”
 
Would get shot?

“No, Facebook said could kill me.” mean? We're going get head around fact living pandemic related deaths time come. mean people unaffected COVID due pandemic lives shortened. People missed treatment perhaps might far treatable opportunity examined specialist pandemic.
